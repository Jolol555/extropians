<em>&gt; &gt;A reversible computer is as likely to take a step backwards as forwards.
</em><br>
<p>That's a rather strange definition, to say the least.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;So even if it manages to complete a calculation from A to B, the process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;will be a random walk, moving forward and backwards many times over each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;portion of the path from A to B.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This thought is entirely new to me, yet makes perfect sense.
</em><br>
<p>This thought is entirely new to me as well, and makes absolutely no sense
<br>
at all. I don't recall the canonical definition of reversiblity (a 30 sec
<br>
session with Google should pull it up), but I would define it that during
<br>
system evolution no two or more states may be mapped to a single state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (After all, truly deterministic and spontaneous action occurs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only when entropy increases, no?)  But in none of my readings on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reversible computation have I ever seen this point made.  So what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is going on?  Perhaps the authors of most works assume that you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need just a tiny minimal amount of entropy increase to drive a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculation forward, and then an equally tiny increase in entropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to drive it backwards.
</em><br>
<p>If you don't erase information, in theory you can make computations at
<br>
constant entropy. This is theoretical best case, in practice you will have
<br>
to make allowance for an entropy increase, but a smaller entropy increase
<br>
than in the case of irreversible system evolution. This is true also for
<br>
current computers, but it is not visible because this vanishes on the
<br>
background of normal operational power dissipation.
<br>
<p>In case of high switch density and rapid rate of operation, you would want
<br>
to use reversible computation, or risk turning your piece of computronium
<br>
into a pool of carbon lava.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you then keep decreasing such a minimal entropy increase, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;mistakes&quot; occur, and the process takes a step backwards while its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long term progress is forward, and vice-versa.  Random walks with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p arbitrarily close to .5 do eventually move in the right direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps Hal's point isn't as significant as I was beginning to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (he implies that it's not terribly significant).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Now if we interpret each step of the computer as instantiating a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bubble of conscious experience, then the consciousness will move forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and backwards in time just like the computer.  You'll think thought 1,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;then thought 2, then you'll think thought 2 backwards, then forwards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;again, then thought 3, then thought 3 backwards, 2 backwards, 1 backwards,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;1 forwards, and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;However of course the conscious mind is not aware of this.  The structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of the computer is such that it would have no memory of having gone back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and forth like this.  In the end when it thinks back over what happened,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it will remember thought 1, then 2, then 3, and so on, straight on to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the end.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;So there is a real disconnect in this case between what we hypothesize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;happening from a functional perspective, and what we have evidence for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;happening based on the reports of the conscious mind.  All we truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have evidence for is that the computation did exist, did complete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;We don't know whether the mind really experienced going backwards and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;forwards like that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;And we especially don't know what form the consciousness took during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the reverse steps.  What does it feel like to have memories erased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rather than stored?  There is no way to ask a person and find out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(that I can see).  Certainly if you ask them after a step is reversed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the answer will obviously be the same as if the step never occured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would like to insert here that &quot;the feel&quot;, itself, is a rather long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational process.  Therefore, so far as I can see, it probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes no difference to the conclusion here that you and others (who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are also up to speed on this issue) arrive at.  Thus it follows that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you had to choose between an experience that expended entropy X but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backtracked at numerous points, and the same experience that went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straight to the conclusion, but expended 2X entropy, then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be indifferent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But not me.  In 1996, I started a thread called &quot;Repeated Experience&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I think that I won all the arguments about it---or at least didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lose---except for one point Robin Hanson got me on.  I was (and still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am) convinced that in almost all thought experiments, repeated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience is to be reckoned as highly as the &quot;original&quot; (identical)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience.  I mean (and meant) that to be taken quite literally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I, on the other hand, might prefer the longer &quot;back-tracking&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience, since I would gain more additional desireable runtime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from it (unless, of course, it was undesireable experience).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; :-)  For example, if you and I attend the same party and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally ravished, then I might be able to prove to you that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it &quot;lasted longer&quot; for me (even though I don't remember it),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and point out that certain exceedingly pleasurable transitions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that occurred during the party were experienced by me many,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many times, and by you only once.
