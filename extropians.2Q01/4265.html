<br>
<p><em>&gt;First, I realize that in my previous message (Re:  I disagree with Lee's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;answer), I was a bit disrespectful of Lee's views.  I apologize.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, let's take a look at what Mark thinks that he has to apologize for:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; ***Answers*** For problems 1, 2, and 3, the answer is 2/3. For...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I disagree with this one. (As you see I am trying to be diplomatic here.)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; First, one of course assumes that sexes are equally probable (they aren't), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise this would not be an interesting little problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One has to be careful about formulation of the problem. Lee wants to ask 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;given that there is at least one girl, what is the probability that there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is one boy and one girl&quot;. The answer to this is of course 2/3, just as Lee 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, this is not what Lee is really asking. Note the pair of phrases: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;one&quot;, and &quot;the other&quot;. What the father is really asking is &quot;I have picked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of my children (not necessarily at random). That child is a girl. What 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the probability that the other child is a boy&quot;. To this question the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer is 1/2.
</em><br>
<p>So what on Earth does Mark feel that he should apologize for?  Even
<br>
his second statement, &quot;As you see I am trying to be diplomatic here.&quot;
<br>
struck me as odd.  In retrospect, I should have realized that Mark has
<br>
much higher standards of politeness than I do.  I think that he was
<br>
reluctant to come out and say, &quot;You're wrong, because....&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However, Lee, instead of pointing it out [i.e., that I, Mark was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disrespectful] (which is the best course of action in such cases),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;responds in kind...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Lee, your long argument in favour of your answer is not needed.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't need your &quot;help&quot;.  Of course I saw your argument immediately.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  But perhaps you should think of others on this list
<br>
who aren't as mathematically sophisticated as you are.  It wasn't
<br>
wrong of me to provide a very thorough explanation, (in order to
<br>
cut down on unnecessary misinterpretations and misunderstandings).
<br>
I'm sorry that it offended you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;my message carefully, you will see I said [that the answer was 2/3]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Anybody with common sense or probability training or intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will quickly arrive at this answer.
</em><br>
<p>This isn't true.  (Sorry for being blunt.)  Eliezer Yudkowski wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think your word problems provide the necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priors.  To estimate the probabilities, I would need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know the algorithms used by each of the people making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements, and that information is not provided.
</em><br>
<p>and that's a sensible point of view, even for someone with
<br>
&quot;probability training and intelligence&quot;.  The problem is
<br>
deliberately tricky and provocative, and debates about it
<br>
can bring out some interesting points.  I think that is fun.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This list is comprised of people who want to preserve their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking, therefore there must be something worth preserving,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and so questions such as these are not &quot;fun&quot; as you claim,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but boring - in my humble opinion.
</em><br>
<p>I entitled the thread &quot;Fun With Bayes' Theorem&quot;,  because I
<br>
thought some would find those problems entertaining.  But if
<br>
those problems were as boring as you say, it's interesting
<br>
that you responded to them.  :-)
<br>
<p>Now, I want to fully apologize for responding to you as I did
<br>
when I wrote &quot;The flaw in your argument is...&quot;, because it was
<br>
unnecessarily condescending.  It was even a worse gaffe because
<br>
you, Mark, had already given me hint that you adhere to a very
<br>
high standard of politeness.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, if you expect people to say &quot;I think that you
<br>
may be mistaken&quot; when the truth is that they think that you are
<br>
dead wrong, then you are going to be very often offended.  But
<br>
the whole question of how to go about being decently polite in
<br>
email is still open, in my book.
<br>
<p>Lee
