<p><em>&gt; I keep my LEGOs from exploding by not building them in such a way that

</em><br>
<p>Ah, ok.  That answers the concern I stated...though it does raise
<br>
another one.  If they can't self-assemble, then you lose a lot of the
<br>
advantage of LEGO et al: once something is assembled, you can't easily
<br>
alter it (including repairs) on site.  There is also the concern of
<br>
getting a finished assembly into orbit, with - at the very least -
<br>
delay during launch, which substantially quenches the instant
<br>
gratification of seeing a LEGO machine work, or put another way,
<br>
significantly slows the built-test-debug cycle down.  (If this last
<br>
sentence is unclear, think of it this way: when writing a computer
<br>
program, you can compile and test it immediately, and thus go through a
<br>
whole lot of testing for relatively little time and even less money;
<br>
when building a machine that can only be tested after a lengthy
<br>
shipment to where it will be used, the time and money cost per test
<br>
cycle mean you can't do as much testing - for serious projects - or
<br>
playing - for non-serious.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Tangentially: Have you heard about the Delta upper stage embarrassments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a few years ago? They used to leave them parked with propellant dregs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still in the tanks. After x thousand hot/cold soak cycles, boom. _Not_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighborly.
</em><br>
<p>Aye.  One might not be able to solve the problem on one's own, but one
<br>
can lead the way in not making the problem worse.
