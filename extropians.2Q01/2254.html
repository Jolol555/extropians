<em>&gt; &gt;Might you specify the working definition of Agnostic you had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in mind? (is it all in the &quot;AND&quot; for you?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How do you define &quot;Zennist&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In my definition an agnostic is someone who largely holds the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of God to be currently unknowable. As I stated previously, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe that we do not know enough about the universe to say with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainty that a God does not exist. (an error of atheists IMMHO)
</em><br>
<p>Not so.  Most atheists I've met would not say &quot;god doesn't exist&quot;, they 
<br>
would say they don't believe it exists.  They're well aware of the problem 
<br>
of making such sweeping claims.  By default, atheism is merely a lack of 
<br>
god belief.  It can also be a form of &quot;assertion of nonexistence&quot;, but this 
<br>
in my experience is much less common, and atheism tends to be described 
<br>
that way in order to strawman it.
<br>
<p>I have problems with the &quot;unknowable&quot; bit too, which is why I use atheist, 
<br>
as it denotes my simple lack of belief.  I've noticed that most agnostics 
<br>
I've met don't buy the &quot;unknowable&quot; thing either.  Claiming that something 
<br>
is &quot;unknown&quot; or &quot;unknowable&quot; is just as much an erroneous assertion as 
<br>
&quot;there are no gods&quot;, since they are all positive claims(requiring positive 
<br>
proof), even if &quot;currently&quot; is added.  So I stick with atheism, as I make 
<br>
no assertion other than my own lack of belief.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Or that if there is, this God is vastly different than what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taught by the world's religions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For example, I have a problem with the notion that any intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being would insist on being worshiped. I find it hard to conceive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of an active intelligence would allow 40,000 children a day to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;starve to death on this planet.
</em><br>
<p>I'm with you here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I realize religions have pat (unacceptable) answers to these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course a wise person would simply take Pascal's wager (Blaise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;look it up) and say they believe. Come to think of it, I repent!!
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't know whether the &quot;wise&quot; person would:)  Then again, a lottery 
<br>
ticket is about the level of my betting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A Zennist is a practitioner of Zen without necessarily being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;buddhist, although there are so many varieties of buddhism I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably fit into one of them. Essentially the difficulty for me is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the death penalty. I see it as an appropriate punishment.
</em><br>
<p>Seems to me like the death penalty is more a case of legalized communal 
<br>
revenge than anything to do with justice.  The idea that a Govt. can 
<br>
actually kill someone is disturbing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In buddhist cosmology the universe is intelligent without there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being a central figure.

crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures

to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
