<p>I could see denying correlation between intelligence any biological
<br>
attribute *other than head size.*  It would be entertaining indeed
<br>
to listen to the absurdly PC arguing there is no correlation between
<br>
brain size and intelligence.  {8^D

<p>This whole idea is growing on me, perhaps because two of
<br>
my closest friends would no longer be with us, had we lived
<br>
in a world without surgery.  They both attempted vaginal
<br>
deliveries and both failed because the babies heads were
<br>
too big.  The medics said without C-sections, likely both
<br>
mothers and their larvae would have perished.
<br>
<p>It is not at all difficult for me to imagine that in times past,
<br>
the 2-sigma bigheads expired, taking their mothers
<br>
with them.  Very suddenly, that factor has been removed,
<br>
and perhaps that can account for at least *some* of the
<br>
theorized increased IQ of the proletariat.  spike
