<p>That may be part of it, but consider drama as an art form.
<br>
Many who have attempted playing roles in a drama really
<br>
appreciate well-done acting.  Consider a movie which I
<br>
recommended to several friends, who all pretty much hated it:
<br>
As Good As It Gets, with Jack Nicholson, Greg Kinnear and
<br>
Helen Hunt.  Its a dark comedy {as is life, eh?} but the acting
<br>
of the three  main characters is terrific.  Even if the story is
<br>
dark, a tragedy in a way, the acting alone makes it worth it
<br>
in that case.
<br>
<p>As Good As It Gets fans, comment?
<br>
<p>Another show is ER: plenty of tragedy, extremely compelling
<br>
acting.  spike
