<em>&gt;&gt; I am arguing that a country should maintain core competencies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the basics of life, it should grow as much of it's own food as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; possible (and economical), it should produce much of it's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; clothing.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Why?  And why does this reasoning not apply to the smaller units
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like states and cities and houses?
</em><br>
<p>I think it does apply to states and cities, and even neighborhoods.
<br>
Houses? Why not molecules and atoms....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What's so special anyway about countries, about geographic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;location? I have a lot more in common with European Extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than with the people who live next door.  How does it benefit me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for my country to be able to produce its own tin or flax?  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difference does it make if something is manufactured in Detroit or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dublin?
</em><br>
<p>There is a big difference between something manufactured in an
<br>
industrialized country and a third world sweatshop.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Are we supposed to be patriotic?  To love our country and respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our leaders?  To get a lump in our throat when we see the flag? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I certainly hope you are not expecting appeals to Jingoistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;patriotism to be effective here.
</em><br>
<p>I think you need to look up the word jingoistic, nothing Ive said
<br>
is remotely similiar.....
