<em>&gt;From The Sound of Music
</em><br>
<p>A FEW OF MY FAVORITE THINGS:
<br>
<p>Maalox and nosedrops and needles for knitting',
<br>
Walkers and handrails and new dental fittin's,
<br>
Bundles of magazines tied up with string,
<br>
These are a few of my favorite things.
<br>
<p>Cadillacs, cataracts, hearing aids, glasses,
<br>
Polident, Fixodent, false teeth in glasses,
<br>
Pacemakers, golf carts and porches with swings,
<br>
These are a few of my favorite things.
<br>
<p>When the pipes leak, When the bones creak, When the knees go bad,
<br>
Then I remember my favorite things and then I don't feel so bad
<br>
<p>Hot tea and crumpets, and corn pads for bunions,
<br>
No spicy hot food and no food with onions,
<br>
Bathrobes and heat pads and hot meals they bring,
<br>
These are a few of my favorite things.
<br>
<p>Back pains, confused brains, and no fear of sinnin',
<br>
Thin bones and fractures and hair that is thinnin'.
<br>
And we won't mention our short shrunken frames
<br>
When we remember our favorite things.
<br>
<p>When the joints ache, when the hips break, When the eyes grow dim,
<br>
Then I remember the great life I've had, And then I don't feel so bad.
<br>
<p>THEN I REMEMBER THE GREAT LIFE I'VE HAD
<br>
AND THEN I DON'T FEEL SOOO BAAAD
