<p><em>&gt;You are only looking one thing: loans.  When I parenthetically mentioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reserves in the quoted statement, I meant it.:)  A bank that sets its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interest rates too low would notice a net drain in reserves.  If it sets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it too high, it would notice a net inflow of reserves.  (This is regardless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the reserve used.)
</em><br>
<p>That would have more to do with the bank's rates relative to other banks.
<br>
In any case, banks can and do change the number of loans they give out,
<br>
independently of interest rate.  Slowdowns get triggered when banks 
<br>
simply refuse to loan much, regardless of interest rate.  Banks can control
<br>
reserves easily under &quot;incorrect&quot; interest rates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In American banks, there were certain limits placed on the banks before the
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Federal Reserve System.  Many of these limits were placed by states and they
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;included requiring the banks to hold a certain amount of state bonds
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;(thereby monetizing government debt), branch banking (disallowing banks to
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;network and spread offices between regions), portfolio requirements (what
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;banks could invest in), minimum capitalization requirements (how much money
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;one needs to start a bank), reserve requirements (how much reserves a bank
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;must have on hand) and limits of interest rates (usury laws; probably didn't
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;have as big an impact).
</em><br>
<p>All true;  but none of this is related to the herd mentality problem.
<br>
<p>(snip various discussion of how the above limits could make banking less 
<br>
efficient, which I basically agree with)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It isn't immediately obvious whether  free-market
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; or relatively apolitical central banking will generate the &quot;better&quot;
</em><br>
<p>result.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I guess the Great Depression and the myriad inflations and hyperinflations
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;are not evidence enough?
</em><br>
<p>Data does vary by country, which is why I put in the &quot;relatively
<br>
independent&quot; caveat.  In the US case, growth volatility has been much
<br>
less after the Fed came in than before.  With the Fed, we had the deflation
<br>
of the 30' and the inflation of the 70's, which I agree would not have gone
<br>
on nearly so long under market systems.  The Bundesbank has never had
<br>
that kind of major goof in 50 years.  No &quot;myriad inflations&quot; here, or
<br>
in Japan, Germany, or Switzerland.  
<br>
<p>Free banking, then, would increase short-term volatility compared to our
<br>
current system while protecting from long-term mismanagement.  Which
<br>
is more important is not immediately clear.  Further, the Fed hyper-deflated
<br>
*once* and hyper-inflated *once* and now seems acutely aware of both
<br>
risks.  The chance of a repeat occurance should be less than the once-in-
<br>
40 years we got in this century.
<br>
<p>(to be fair, you could make a case that short-term volatility has long-term
<br>
benefits.  But you do have to demonstrate that first.)
