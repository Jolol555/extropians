<p>So they claim, but test instruments can't detect the wonderful things vacuum
<br>
tubes are supposed to do, I certainly can't hear it, and even those of the golden
<br>
ear don't do very well in double blind experiments. I think it's a case of &quot;this 30 watt
<br>
class A mono tube amplifier cost $5000 so it must sound better than this $50 transistor
<br>
amplifier from Radio Shack&quot;. But perhaps not.

<p><em>    &gt; Those boxes proved highly resistant to conventional ECM protocols,

<p>I don't see why it would be more resistant to electronic counter measures, ok it might be
<br>
a little easier to protect against a nuclear electromagnetic pulse but a steam engine would
<br>
be even tougher but that's no reason to put one on a modern fighter plane.

<p><em>    &gt;Chances are we'll see use of (low voltage emitter, since nanotube electron
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;emission enhanced) use MEMS-fabricated vacuum tubes for special purposes.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that is a interesting technology, vacuum tubes could make a come back someday,
<br>
but I don't think that's what the USSR had in 1975.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I wonder why they didn't have hardware self-destruct (cases lined with
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;thin plastique sheets, nonvolatile storage mounted in thermite boxes),
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;and had to resort to archaic (pick-axe) destruction methods.
</em><br>
<p>If I was in a aircraft that was already damaged and dropping like a rock setting off a
<br>
thermite bomb inside my crippled craft wouldn't be a happy prospect. The most
<br>
important thing is the software anyway and that's easy to safely erase, if you have
<br>
time after that just grab an axe. It works and it's safe.
