<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't the TOE really the start of interesting physics, rather than the
</em><br>
end?
<br>
<em>&gt; Once you've got the formulas, are they just for your T-Shirt, or do you
</em><br>
then
<br>
<em>&gt; need to find out what they imply?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Of course it is sometimes thought to be the other way around, viz., that all
<br>
the interesting stuff will be done and the rest will be merely filling in
<br>
the banal details--because parts explain wholes. This is sometimes backed-up
<br>
with the thought that the higher level phenomena of the special sciences
<br>
(biology, chemistry, etc.) will be reducible by bridge laws to laws of
<br>
physics. Obviously this raises (or begs) a number of questions about what it
<br>
is to &quot;reduce&quot; one phenomena to another, and issues about emergent
<br>
properties etc. (Perhaps the whole is greater than the sum of the parts--to
<br>
put it crudely). To my mind this debate is not particularly interesting
<br>
since the only way we could possibly know that we have discovered the final
<br>
TOE is if we have completed the sciences of the mind--because there is
<br>
always the possibility that we could create a better theoretician who
<br>
discovers a better or deeper TOE. (The rub, of course is that it is hard to
<br>
see how one could complete the sciences of the mind if one has not completed
<br>
physics, e.g., perhaps we need to advance physics to create quantum
<br>
computing or faster than light travel to turbo charge the Jupiter brains.
<br>
However, humans in all probability will be left in the cognitive dust by the
<br>
time the issue of which has methodological priority becomes pressing). As a
<br>
practical consequence of this one might argue that the millions invested in
<br>
say particle accelerators would be better invested in the sciences of the
<br>
mind. Since, in all probability, the biggest bottleneck in discovering a
<br>
final TOE has to do with the nature of the platform upon which theoretical
<br>
physics is now conducted, i.e., the human mind (pace, Hawking, Weinberg, et
<br>
al.). Wouldn't that be a boon for AI!
