Hi!
<br>
<p>You wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;Thanks for pointing this out to me. I'll need to read more about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sexual maturation in mice before I can form an opinion.  If you happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to have any references, or even partly-remembered names of authors or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paper titles, I'd be grateful. Either way, when I find out more about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this, I'll follow up.
</em><br>
<p>I took &quot;CR mice taking twice the time to reach sexual maturity&quot; from
<br>
Hayflick's book. Finch's book also offers some thoughts and, as usual, a
<br>
very complete set of findings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; As you probably know, if you increase the caloric intake of mice, they live
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the same. So, total energy consumption does not explain everything. You can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm not sure I understand. Do you mean if you feed mice a higher calorie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;diet than they would ordinarily eat? Or do you mean if you take CR mice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and put them on a normal diet, thus making them no longer CR?
</em><br>
<p>Neither. This was an experiment done in the 80s to disprove Kleiber's rule
<br>
(which claimed that maximum lifespan correlates with cellular metabolic
<br>
rates). What they did was place mice under lower temperatures. Since they
<br>
had to burn more energy to compensate for the lower temperature, they ate
<br>
44% more. Yet they lived the same as the controls. Ref:
<br>
<p>Holloszy, J. O., and Smith, E. K. (1986). &quot;Longevity of cold-exposed rats: a
<br>
reevaluation of the &quot;rate-of-living theory&quot;.&quot; J Appl Physiol 61(5):1656-60.
<br>
<p>There's another guy trying to repeat this experiment but I forgot his name
<br>
-- I know he works in Scotland.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Atrophies&quot; implies pathological processes, and this is not the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in CR animals. They have less fat, and lower muscle mass, but no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;degeneration. I'll need to do some lit searching to check whether they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exhibit lower activity or retarded development. The fact that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;smaller and weaker doesn't automatically mean they are less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;active. Lower temperature is not the same thing as lower metabolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rate-- metabolic rate is measured as oxygen consumption per gram body
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weight.
</em><br>
<p>In a congress last year I saw pictures of NIA's -- the team of Roth and
<br>
Ingram -- CR monkeys next to the controls and they looked like miserable
<br>
dwarfs. I don't think most persons are interested in going through that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Remember, though, the goal is learning to reproduce the improved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;oxidative stress response and improved repair mechanisms induced by CR
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without actually undergoing CR.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, if you can give me CR's life extension without any side-effects, I'll
<br>
love it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Are you interested in aging research? If so, good for you-- it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crucial question as far as health is concerned, and interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from a theoretical point of view as well.
</em><br>
<p>I'm a Ph.D. student in cellular senescence. I work on oxidative stress and
<br>
the telomeres.
<br>
<p>Best wishes.
