A French Canadian program on cloning was shown on Oz TV a few days ago,
<br>
CLONE, INC. Made in 1999, I think, hence full of David Seed's now forgotten
<br>
posturing; and a bunch of Raelians including Rael the UFO abductee in his
<br>
Raymond Massey THINGS TO COME wide samurai shoulders space suit, and other
<br>
world experts in deep thought. I especially detested a woman psychoanalyst
<br>
who did the full French *differance* word salad thing, except that this
<br>
time she was dead set against difference. It would destroy generational
<br>
time, alors! The predictable category mistakes in abundance; the desire for
<br>
immortality is a phallic phantasy, rising from the dead, thrusting into the
<br>
future, sort of thing (actually I don't recall her saying anything as
<br>
coherent as that). It's very strange to watch: I don't like X, it makes me
<br>
feel weird, so hey, it must be an example of displaced shit-eating or
<br>
murderous rage against the father etc. Never the slightest hint that this
<br>
applies equally to catching a tram, or getting a tooth filled, or having a
<br>
haircut. Of course hardcore Lacanians and the like *do* apply the same
<br>
gratuitous gibberish to such everyday activities, and seem pleased as punch
<br>
even though everything then factors back to zero. Sigh.
