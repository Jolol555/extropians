</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unable to restrain themselves from ad infinitum ad nauseum propagandizing.

<em>&gt;&gt; I know full well to whom, and to what, I am speaking when I address them.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; !
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We've all been through this too many times.  If you just ignore the debate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it might -- ah, might! -- go away.  Just cool out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You also have to realize that when you go into rant mode in an open forum,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's the equivalent of screaming like a madman in a restaurant.  You might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think you're directing your comments at a few people -- who you leave
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nameless for the rest of us, so we can't judge -- but everyone reads them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here, including people who might not have read them before.  Including
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people who might just think you're being an ass.  (I'm not saying you are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then again I rarely read any of the posts with &quot;GUN&quot; in the subject line.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also rarely read anything from Ian...:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For the record, I'm against any limits on gun ownership, but really this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on/off debate does nothing to change society or people's minds.  You are for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such limits.  Your tantrum did not change my mind.  Nor do I believe a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;similar tantrum by someone on my side of the fence will change yours.  So,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what's the point?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
When you say NO LIMITS, dose this include convicted violent criminals, three year old kids, and the mentally incompetent and unstable?  Are you THAT extremist?  How would you work such a system?  Would parents be jailed for removing legally purchased guns from their kids' possession?  Could prison and asylum wardens be sued for abridging inmates' rights to keep and bear?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Peace!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Exactly what I want, and if the above can purchase, keep and bear, we will all have less peace, both of body and of mind.
