<p>This did occur to me, but I was thinking more of
<br>
total dosage of mercury over the long haul from
<br>
fillings.  There was a bigger weakness in my calcs
<br>
that no one has hit on yet: what happens if a filling
<br>
fails and there is a sudden dose of mercury from
<br>
a pocket of higher-than-average concentration of
<br>
Hg?  That is, what if that machine that shakes up
<br>
the mixture somehow leaves a pocket of Hg that
<br>
is inside the filling and after a long time it somehow
<br>
gets exposed?  Does a small but sudden dose of
<br>
Hg cause problems more than a steady very low
<br>
exposure?  Ive only had one filling fail in all the years
<br>
Ive had fillings, but who knows?  Had I lost 5 or 10
<br>
IQ points that week I probably would never
<br>
miss em.  {8^D
<br>
<p>I have been looking all over my office for possible
<br>
sources of mercury.  Those flourescent tubes, don't
<br>
they contain mercury vapor?  If so, the tubes eventally
<br>
fail, right?  Why do they fail?  Does the mercury
<br>
vapor leak out?  Where does it go?  And how does
<br>
the OSHA know what is the safe level?  Are there
<br>
other sources of mercury in the home or office?  In
<br>
retrospect this is a complicated question, and I
<br>
hereby give myself and Pooh Bear a good scolding
<br>
for our cocksure attitude.  {8-]  spike and Pooh
