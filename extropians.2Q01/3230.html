Transistors made from carbon nanotubes are not new, they were first made in 1998,
<br>
but in today's issue of Science researchers from IBM report on a method of making
<br>
them that is far more precise and easier to scale up. It's a little ironic that the lead
<br>
researcher Phaedon Avouris has always been a vocal skeptic of Nanotechnology,
<br>
he now says &quot; in principle we now have the potential for forming an integrated electronics&quot;.
<br>
<p>In the same issue of Science are two new advances in Stem Cells. In one mouse
<br>
embryonic stem cells were induced to turn into insulin producing cells, when transferred
<br>
into diabetic mice the mice needed fewer insulin shots to live. In another article a bit a
<br>
adult mouse's tail was cut off and the tissue was turned into embryonic stem cells,
<br>
then they morphed the stem cells into dopamine producing cells, the sort of cells
<br>
that are lost in Parkinson's disease. Both said they would have used Human cells
<br>
instead of mouse cells if the government had let them.
<br>
<p>Today's New York Times says IBM will spend several billion dollars over the next few
<br>
years on something called &quot;Project Eliza&quot;. It would enable computers to  &quot;use machine
<br>
intelligence to adjust to changing workloads, recognize faults and repair themselves
<br>
without human intervention&quot;.
