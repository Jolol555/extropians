<p>'Tractor beam' technology advances
<br>
<p><p><p>The beam consists of a helix of twisting laser light
<br>
<p>By BBC News Online science editor Dr David Whitehouse 
<br>
A &quot;tractor beam&quot; that can reach out, trap and move objects has been developed 
<br>
by British scientists. 
<br>
<p>But while fictional tractor beams of the kind depicted in Star Trek can 
<br>
ensnare a giant spaceship, this real version works only at the microscopic 
<br>
level. 
<br>
<p>The beam consists of a helix of twisting laser light, which is able to seize 
<br>
hold of objects as small as a protein molecule. 
<br>
<p>Scientists believe it will be an invaluable tool for manipulating parts of 
<br>
living cells or components of micro-machines. 
<br>
<p>Glass beads 
<br>
<p>Dr Kishan Dholakia, of St Andrews University, said: &quot;Our technique could be 
<br>
used to drive motors, mixers, centrifuges and other rotating parts in cheap, 
<br>
tiny, automated technologies of the future.&quot; 
<br>
<p><p><p>The beam can rotate tiny objects
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The researchers speculate that components like these might one day appear on 
<br>
microchip laboratories capable of performing a range of chemical and 
<br>
biological tests. 
<br>
<p>So far, the scientists have tried out the system with glass beads 100 times 
<br>
thinner than a human hair, and a tiny glass rod which could be used for 
<br>
stirring minute amounts of liquid. 
<br>
<p>They also used the beam to rotate a hamster chromosome to demonstrate its 
<br>
potential for studying structures inside the cell. Optical tweezers, which 
<br>
allow particles trapped in a tightly focused laser beam to be moved from one 
<br>
spot to another, already exist. 
<br>
<p>But the devices are severely limited because they cannot change an object's 
<br>
orientation. A proper tractor beam, say scientists, must be able to rotate 
<br>
objects as well as move them. 
<br>
<p>Just a beginning 
<br>
<p>The researchers describe in the journal Science how they extended the 
<br>
principles of optical tweezers technology. In both systems, a particle gets 
<br>
trapped in the laser beam because some of the light refracts when it hits the 
<br>
object. 
<br>
<p>This changes the momentum of the object, which is forced towards the spot in 
<br>
the beam where the light is most intense. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The beauty of our technique is that we can dictate how far we want the 
<br>
spiral pattern to go around and at what speed,&quot; Dr Dholakia said. &quot;That means 
<br>
we can fully control the rotation of that one particle.&quot; 
<br>
<p>He added: &quot;We've only just begun to realise the possibilities for what we 
<br>
might do with this technology.&quot;

Cynical postulate: He made a decision to rely upon the advice of 
<br>
someone(s) older and wiser, who remained in the background. 
<br>
Alternatively, could be he was freakishly advanced (in a good way) 
<br>
from a very young age and so began gathering relevant experience and 
<br>
accumulating wisdom while others his age were still sucking their 
<br>
thumbs--in which case, the wisdom *still* took time to develop, and 
<br>
he simply began earlier. Not knowing him, I can only speculate.
