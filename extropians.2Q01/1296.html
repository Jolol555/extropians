<p>
FBI to require lie detector tests on systems administrators
<br>
<a href="http://computerworld.com/cwi/story/0,1199,NAV47_STO58852_NLTpm,00.html">http://computerworld.com/cwi/story/0,1199,NAV47_STO58852_NLTpm,00.html</a>
<br>
By DAN VERTON
<br>
(March 22, 2001) The FBI last week quietly expanded its use of the
<br>
polygraph to cover systems administrators and all other employees with
<br>
access to sensitive computer networks and databases, marking the first
<br>
time that IT specialists in the government have been singled out for the
<br>
controversial lie detector test.
<br>
FBI Director Louis Freeh issued a memorandum last week that put the new
<br>
policy into effect immediately, said agency spokesman Bill Carter. &quot;The
<br>
director notified all employees that interim changes have been made to the
<br>
FBI security program, including an expansion of the use of the polygraph
<br>
to cover employees in sensitive areas,&quot; Carter said. To date, the FBI's
<br>
polygraph policy has been used to conduct periodic tests of employees at
<br>
random.
<br>
<p>The change in policy is a direct response to the Feb. 18 arrest of Robert
<br>
Phillip Hanssen in one of the most damaging spy scandals in the bureau's
<br>
history. Hanssen, a career FBI agent with access to highly classified
<br>
counterintelligence databases, is accused of spying for Russia since 1985
<br>
and giving Russian intelligence agents details about U.S. intelligence
<br>
sources and electronic surveillance operations (see story).
<br>
<p>However, the Hanssen case is unique in that the computer-savvy
<br>
counterintelligence agent used his access to the FBI's Electronic Case
<br>
File system, which contains classified information about ongoing FBI
<br>
investigations, to check whether the bureau had been alerted to his
<br>
activities. Although Hanssen and his Russian handlers relied heavily on
<br>
traditional spying methods, such as &quot;dead drops&quot; for exchanging packages
<br>
anonymously, the case is being touted by the FBI and IT security experts
<br>
as a harsh lesson in the growing threat to corporate data by insiders.
<br>
<p>As a result, the new FBI policy also includes what Carter called technical
<br>
&quot;enhancements&quot; to the bureau's ability to monitor and analyze the computer
<br>
activity of employees in sensitive areas of the bureau and to detect
<br>
&quot;anomalies.&quot;
<br>
<p>Steven Aftergood, who runs the Project on Government Secrecy at the
<br>
Federation of American Scientists in Washington, said he thinks this the
<br>
first case where system administrators have been singled out to take the
<br>
polygraph. It's also clear, he said, that the revised testing policy is a
<br>
direct reaction to the FBI's failure to monitor Hanssen's online
<br>
activities in real time before he could do damage.
<br>
<p>Still, it's unclear, pending the release of an ongoing independent review
<br>
of the Hanssen case, whether the new polygraph policy will remain in
<br>
effect.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a bit of a compromise,&quot; said Aftergood. &quot;There is a cultural
<br>
resistance to the polygraph that is different at the FBI than at the CIA.
<br>
A polygraph is something that is given to new employees and suspected
<br>
criminals, not to employees in good standing.&quot;
<br>
<p>Polygraphs are used regularly at the CIA as a hiring tool and as a method
<br>
of uncovering spies within the agency. Employees are hooked up to a
<br>
machine that records pulse, heart and breathing rates during a series of
<br>
questions. Changes in those rates are then recorded and used to determine
<br>
truthfulness.
<br>
<p>However, while polygraphs have been an important tool over the years in
<br>
catching people who have betrayed national secrets, experts are split on
<br>
their accuracy and acknowledge they can finger honest people as well as
<br>
criminals and spies. Convicted CIA spy Aldrich Ames, for example, passed
<br>
his polygraph examinations.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think there will be problems and cases where employees are tripped up
<br>
by the tests,&quot; said Aftergood. &quot;But the bureau as a whole will adapt.&quot;
<br>
<p>Alan Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, a security
<br>
research organization in Bethesda, Md., characterized the increased focus
<br>
on internal security and personnel monitoring as &quot;the Carnivore effect,&quot;
<br>
referring to the FBI's controversial system for e-mail monitoring (see
<br>
story).
<br>
<p>&quot;People have discovered that system administrators have unfettered access
<br>
to all the most private information being passed through their systems,&quot;
<br>
said Paller. &quot;With it comes a sense that there ought to be some controls
<br>
on what they see and what they do with it. [However,] I have not yet seen
<br>
any consensus on what they are going to do about these new discoveries.&quot;
<br>
<p>John Pescatore, an analyst at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner Group Inc.,
<br>
said although he can see the benefit of subjecting systems administrators
<br>
to polygraphs, he doesn't see polygraph testing becoming widespread.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is expensive and intrusive,&quot; said Pescatore, adding that the national
<br>
security community on average only does them every five years because of
<br>
cost. However, &quot;the average time at a job of a system administrator is
<br>
less than three years,&quot; he said.
