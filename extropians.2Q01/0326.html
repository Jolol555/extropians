<p>In the relational database world, a little judiciously-applied
<br>
redundancy can save a lot of time.  In an amorphous network like
<br>
the Web, it can also save time, and even save the day when links turn
<br>
out to be broken or stale (which can happen quickly enough, even
<br>
for items that seem at first to be plastered all over the place).
<br>
<p>This reminds me of an extremely funny story I first read in the
<br>
60's, long before FATs and clusters and fragments and suchlike
<br>
became commonly-known concepts, called _Ms Fnd In A Lbry_ by
<br>
Hal Draper:
<br>
<p>&quot;On the mother planet there are early traces of books. This 
<br>
word denotes paleoliterary records of knowledge in repre-
<br>
sentational and macroscopic form. Of course, these disap-
<br>
peared very early... when their increase threatened to leave no
<br>
place on the planet’s surface for anything else.
<br>
First they were reduced to micros, and then to super-
<br>
micros, which were read with the primeval electronic micro-
<br>
scopes then extant... At about this time, too, their cumbersome
<br>
alphabet was reduced to mainly consonantal elements (thus: thr 
<br>
cmbrsm alfbt w rdsd t mnl cnsntl elmnts) but this was done to 
<br>
facilitate quick reading, and only incidentally did it cut down 
<br>
the mass of Bx (the new spelling) by a full third. A drop out of 
<br>
the bucket...  The fundamental advance, at least in principle, came
<br>
when  the representational records were abandoned altogether in 
<br>
favor of punched supermicros, in which the supermicroscopic 
<br>
elements were the punches themselves. This began the epoch 
<br>
of abstract recs—or Rx, to use the modern term...
<br>
<p>Finally—but this took another yukal and was technologically
<br>
associated with the expansion of the civilization to 
<br>
intergalactic proportions—Fx and Sng found that quanta in 
<br>
hyperbolic tensor systems could be tensed into occupying the 
<br>
same spatial and temporal coordinates, if properly pizzicated. 
<br>
In no time at all, a quantic pizzicator was devised to compress 
<br>
the nudged quanta into overlapping spaces, most of these 
<br>
being arranged in the wide-open areas lying between the outer 
<br>
electrons and the nucleus of the atom, leaving the latter free 
<br>
for tables of contents, illustrations, graphs, etc.
<br>
All the Rx ever produced could now be packed away in a 
<br>
single drawer... and glowing speeches pointed out that science had 
<br>
once more refuted pessimistic croakings of doom. Even so, 
<br>
two speakers could not refrain from mentioning certain mis-
<br>
givings. . . .
<br>
<p>[A]s we well know, the Rx in the new storage systems 
<br>
could be scanned only by activating the nudged or pizzicated 
<br>
quanta, etc. by means of a code number, arranged as an index 
<br>
to the Rx. Clearly the index itself had to be kept repre-
<br>
sentational and macroscopic, else a code number would 
<br>
become necessary to activate **it**...
<br>
<p>[A] process came into play of which even the ancients had had
<br>
presentiments. According to a tradition  recorded by Kchv among
<br>
some oldsters in the remote Los Angeles swamps, the thing started
<br>
when an antique sage  produced one of the paleoliterary Bx entitled
<br>
An Index to Indexes (or Ix t Ix), coded as a primitive I2. By the time
<br>
of the  supermicros there were several Indexes to Indexes to Indexes 
<br>
(I3), and work had already started on an I4.  These were the innocent
<br>
days before the problem became acute. Later, Index runs were collected
<br>
in Files, and Files in  Catalogs—so that, for example, C3F5I4 meant that
<br>
you wanted an Index to Indexes to Indexes to Indexes which was to be 
<br>
found in a certain File of Files of Files of Files of Files, which 
<br>
in turn was contained in a Catalog of Catalogs of Catalogs. Of 
<br>
course, actual numbers were much greater. This structure 
<br>
grew exponentially...
<br>
<p>It began with what seemed a routine breakdown in one of 
<br>
the access lines from D57x103 to D42x107. A Bibliothecal Mechanic set
<br>
out to fix it as usual. It did not fix. He realized that 
<br>
a classification error must have been made by the ariadnologist
<br>
who had worked on the last pseudosolar system. Tracing 
<br>
the misnudged quanta involved, he ran into: “See C11F73I15.”
<br>
Laboriously tracing through, he found the note:
<br>
‘This Ix class has been replaced by C32F7I10 for brachygravitic
<br>
endo-ranganathans and C22F64I3 for ailurophenolphthaleinic exoranganathans.”
<br>
Tracing this through in turn, he found that they led back to 
<br>
the original C11F73I15!  At this point he called in the district Bibliothecal
<br>
Technician, who pointed out that the misnudged sequence could be 
<br>
restored only by reference to the original Rx. Through the 
<br>
area Bibliothecal Engineer, an emergency message was sent 
<br>
to the chief himself, Mlvl Dwy Smth.
<br>
Without hesitation, His Bibliothecal Excellency pressed the 
<br>
master button on his desk and queried the Ix System for: 
<br>
“Knowledge, Universal—All Rx-Drawers, Location of.”
<br>
To his stunned surprise, the answer came back: “See also 
<br>
C11F73I15.”
<br>
Frantically he turned dials, nudged quanta, etc. but it was 
<br>
no use. Somewhere in the galaxy-size flood of Ix drawers was 
<br>
the one and only drawer of Rx, the one that had once been 
<br>
installed with great joy. It was somewhere among the Indexes, 
<br>
Bibliographies, Bibliographies of Bibliographies, Histories of 
<br>
Bibliographies, Histories of Histories of Bibliographies, etc.
<br>
A desperate physical search was started, but it did not get 
<br>
very far, breaking down when it was found that no communi-
<br>
cation was possible in the first place without reference to the 
<br>
knowledge stored in the Rx. As the entire bibliothecal staff 
<br>
was diverted for the emergency, breakdowns in the access 
<br>
lines multiplied and tangled, until whole sectors were disabled,
<br>
rendering further cooperation even less possible. The 
<br>
fabric of this biped civilization started falling apart.&quot;
<br>
<p>Cheers!
