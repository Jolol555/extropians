</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My Hypothesis  (Or &quot;Shanghai'ed&quot; Scenario, if you will indulge me:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look at it from the Chinese perspective; You have this aircraft you need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;dissuade&quot; from peeping on you (be it in your airspace or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international.  Either way it's close enough to give your leaders the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective willies).  You can't fire on it.  No siree.  Whether in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; International skies or your own backyard, you fire on it and the other side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will see it as an act of aggression, or worse.  While this sort of thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; went on in the Cold War, you can't hope to keep that quiet in todays'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world.  And even in the bad old days, it was a mostly a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;escorting&quot; your &quot;guests&quot; out of your skies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>For example, some guy, Mathias Rust, flew a commuter plane into Red Square
<br>
during the Cold War.  It was so funny, at the time.  They let him land.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From what I understand, the Chinese fighters were flying too close to the other
</em><br>
plane.  Then, one of the Chinese fighters crashed into the plane and tore off an
<br>
engine and the nose of the plane, but it crashed that fighter into the
<br>
international ocean.
<br>
<p>I don't understand why the plane landed in China.  If it was still flying, I
<br>
wonder how far it was to friendly airspace and a friendly airport, if the
<br>
Chinese would not acknowledge the landing signals.  My interpretation would be
<br>
that they would land because they were concerned about the Chinese pilot, and
<br>
thought that landing would be friendly.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the pilot gets told &quot;Get it down without shooting it down&quot;.  What's left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for him to do?  What they did in WWII when the cannon had jammed or you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just poured your last ammo belt into Jerry.  You give him a not-so-friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nudge.  Of course in the old days you'd try and wedge your entire crate in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other guys' cockpit, but here it's a delicate &quot;tip&quot;.  However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something goes a amiss.  Either a misjudgement by the jet jockey, or panic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the &quot;visitor&quot;, or turbulence from the jets' wake, and you've got a jet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in trouble and an enemy coming down one way or another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think they had any weapons.  What kind of planes were the Chinese
<br>
fighter jets?  How were they armed?
<br>
<p>These are questions I would want answered by, for example, the flight recorders.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My guess is the White House, knowing the &quot;facts&quot;, will go along with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;accident&quot; story and instruct the U.S. crew to keep their traps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shut.  Telling the world that a Chinese pilot tried to ram them out of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air would leave the White House with an angry nation expecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; payback.  And the U.S. Government can't afford to be in a payback mood with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the only other real superpower on the planet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any kernel of truth?  Or am I just smoking something?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; James...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Q, Star Trek:TNG episode 'Q Who'
</em><br>
<p>Well, I would suggest collusion.  Yet, it could be completely coincidental.
<br>
After all, it could be just one of those things.  Then again, I wouldn't know.
