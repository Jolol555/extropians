<br>
<p>contains a book review of Dinesh D'Souza's new book &quot;The Virtue of 
<br>
Prosperity&quot; - review by Jeffrey Tucker, vice president of the Mises Institute.
<br>
<p>a few selected quotes from the review:
<br>
<p>&quot;The author takes on the role of a roving sociologist who presents the 
<br>
arguments both ways, conceding good points and refuting bad ones along the 
<br>
way. At each stage in the argument, he offers interesting new twists on the 
<br>
old debate over the cultural consequences of capitalism. He concludes that 
<br>
prosperity brings social and even spiritual blessings that too casually are 
<br>
overlooked. He makes the case that it is possible for people to uphold 
<br>
ancient virtues in an advanced, capitalist society. &quot;
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>&quot;What about the supposed loss of the old world and the old neighborhood where 
<br>
people lived in communion with God, nature, and one another? D’Souza ponders 
<br>
the real-world traits that built the &quot;old community&quot; and reduces them to 
<br>
three: ethnic identity, economic necessity, and the threat of conflict. The 
<br>
old community was not so much a product of free association, in his view, but 
<br>
rather a reflection of ever-present physical and material threats that caused 
<br>
small group of ethnically and religiously homogeneous people to band together 
<br>
for mutual self-protection. Because these threats have dissipated, so have 
<br>
the social structures that formed in response to them.&quot;
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>&quot;On the topic of community solidarity, the book contains an interesting 
<br>
revelation: Sociologist Daniel Bell, the original member of the Party of Nah, 
<br>
apparently is no longer willing to defend his thesis that capitalism contains 
<br>
internal &quot;contradictions&quot; that lead to its undoing. &quot;Morality has never been 
<br>
in very good shape,&quot; he tells D’Souza, and capitalist prosperity has not made 
<br>
it any worse. When D’Souza asks about Bell's famous thesis concerning the 
<br>
relationship between capitalism and social decay, Bell responds with visible 
<br>
annoyance: &quot;Don’t talk to me about that. . . . It’s all bullshit.&quot; &quot;
