<p><em>&gt;Assuming a sigmoid anytime soon is clueless, and I say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this just based on standard economics, not any special
</em><br>
<em>&gt;singularity concept.  The world economy has been doubling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every 15 years for a century now, and just continuing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growth for another two or more centuries should make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an enormous dent in the biosphere.  If we knock ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;off, we'll likely take much of the biosphere with us.
</em><br>
<p>Environmental effects, at least, do seem to follow a sigmoid.
<br>
In most respects the US and Europe do less than they did
<br>
20-30 years ago.  At least some believe we will knock 
<br>
ourselves off without obliterating the biosphere and the
<br>
amount of biodiversity available then will have a significant
<br>
effect on that available post-knock.  Most are shooting for
<br>
a giant reserve policy - they think humans will or can reserve
<br>
vast areas for natural evolution and leave them that way
<br>
forever.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Some actually kind of agree with you.  Jeremy Jackson
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;predicted in his presentation that within a century or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;so there would be no creature left in the oceans larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;than a minnow and most of the coastal ocean would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;choked with various kinds of algae overgrowth.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Glad to hear it.  Did you try to get them to think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;large human growth scenarios?
</em><br>
<p>Dr. Jackson was obviously very upset by this scenario, so, no
<br>
I didn't discuss the possibility that it could be even worse.
<br>
Remember, although they might agree with you on the
<br>
predicted outcome, to them it's a horror scenario!
<br>
I only broached such subjects with a few people (none of the
<br>
ones who were discussing human-dominated ecologies)
<br>
and they were generally not receptive on limits-to-growth
<br>
grounds.
