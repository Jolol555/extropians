<em>&gt; &gt;First, 300 mcg Hg/m3 is not equal to 0.3 mg/m3, but let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;us ignore that, since I didn't use it in my calcs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    IAN: 300 mcg = 0.3 mg, or not? Or is that your point?
</em><br>
<p>Ian I was hoping you would let me slide on that one since
<br>
Im not accustomed to the unit mcg.  {8^D  But if I had to
<br>
guess and my lazy ass failed to look it up on the web, I
<br>
would think it is a milli-centigram.  300 of these would be
<br>
3 mg.  Had they meant 0.3 mg, would they not have said
<br>
300 microgram?  {8-]
<br>
<p>Since I wasnt sure, I used your figure for the OSHA
<br>
safe limit of 0.1 mg/m^3.
<br>
<p>I would not be surprised to find people with high
<br>
readings of HgO in the mouth, but I dont think dental
<br>
fillings are the source, otherwise they would be gone
<br>
by now.  There is said to be mercury concentrations
<br>
in some fish, which causes me much more consternation,
<br>
as I am one to devour these at every opportunity.  {As
<br>
a side issue, I am quite morally conflicted about this,
<br>
for when I eat fish, I am not eating beef, poultry or
<br>
swine.  We do farm animals a favor by devouring their
<br>
flesh, for if humans did not do so, these beasts would
<br>
not live at all.  By creating a market for them, we give
<br>
them *some* life, which is presumably better than no
<br>
life at all, eh?  But fish *would* live otherwise, being
<br>
wild animals.  So do your good deed today and eat
<br>
a steak.}
<br>
<p>In conclusion, if high HgO readings are being found,
<br>
we should find and eliminate these.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I was in a room where air Hg0 was 0.3 mg/m3 and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    an Hg0 meter was placed in my mouth, measuring the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Hg0 content of in-drawn air (assuming that I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    no amalgam fillings), what would the measure read?
</em><br>
<p>Depends on how much Hg is already in your system,
<br>
presumably from other sources, such as your food.
<br>
The mouth is highly vascular, which is why one's BAC
<br>
can be estimated from breath alone.  I could see how
<br>
HgO could be found in the mouth of a fillingless person
<br>
in a room which contained no mercury.
<br>
<p>Also consider this:  Fischer was right about all the
<br>
other wacky things he did and said.  {8^D  spike
