</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Actually, the concept of &quot;cultural suicide&quot; is a highly chauvinistic one;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it's the belief that because Euro-American &quot;Western&quot; culture currently has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  high technology and working government, it means that high technology and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  scientific knowledge and working governments are the proprietary property

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  accusation that I want to impose Western culture on the world.  Raving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  chauvinists, the lot of them.
</em><br>
<p>Technology may be &quot;cultureless&quot;, but knowledge definitely isn't, at least the 
<br>
kinds of knowledge that we're talking about in this thread.  Sure, it's true 
<br>
in Venezuela and Argentina and South Africa and Indonesia that the Earth's 
<br>
gravity will accelerate an object at 32 feet per second^2, but that just 
<br>
means that things fall the same speed all over the world.  Ohm's Law works 
<br>
the same all over the world, but that doesn't mean that everyone knows how to 
<br>
build and operate an electric power market in a way that keeps the lights on 
<br>
(see California).
<br>
<p>Sci/tech folks may not like to admit it, but the kinds of knowledge that make 
<br>
a social system operate for the maximum benefit of as many of its members as 
<br>
possible aren't the same kinds of knowledge that allow you to build a car 
<br>
that works well or a computer network that doesn't crash.  One of the key 
<br>
differences lies in the realm of moral values, which simply aren't &quot;known&quot; in 
<br>
the same way that scientific facts are known.
<br>
<p>Consider that real understanding of the scientific method and the basic 
<br>
knowledge that makes up a scientific world-view aren't that much more widely 
<br>
distributed in the First World than they are in the two-thirds of the world 
<br>
that are struggling to break through to self-reinforcing and 
<br>
self-perpetuating modernism.  The cultural world of the average First Worlder 
<br>
is just as full of silliness in the form of TV sitcoms and New Age or 
<br>
traditional religious nonsense as the cultural world of the average Second or 
<br>
Third Worlder may be full of pre-modern superstition.  The significant 
<br>
difference lies in basic values that are widely held concerning the role of 
<br>
the individual vis-à-vis society at large, attitudes toward authority and 
<br>
largely unconscious assumptions about the terms of the social contract.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; How do you change the basic habits of mind that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; are inherent in almost every aspect of people's lives?  One thing that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; work is simple, &quot;top-down&quot; institutional reform.  Instead, what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; is a broad-based and deep impetus to honest self-assessment.  How this 
</em><br>
can
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; be fostered is the real challenge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Good luck, you'll need it.  Frankly, I think cultural healing is unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  without a dei-ex-machina technological fix, whether it's ubiquitous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Internet, Earthweb, or a Sysop Scenario.
</em><br>
<p>Here I'm in agreement, at least as a partial prescription for this set of 
<br>
problems.  The history of the 20th century indicates to me that the rate of 
<br>
diffusion of values that lead to self-perpetuating progress has reached a 
<br>
near standstill.  The basic balance between the First World and the rest of 
<br>
the world has been essentially static for a hundred years.  Russia, Japan, 
<br>
Taiwan and South Korea are the only societies that managed to cross over that 
<br>
divide during the 20th century, representing only a small fraction of the 
<br>
world's population.  And conditions in Russia threaten to tip it back into 
<br>
Second World status (much of the country never having made the transition at 
<br>
all).
<br>
<p>I think it will take both a breakthrough in technology and some new cultural 
<br>
and political paradigm to bring the rest of the world forward into the modern 
<br>
era.  As I've written here before, I think that technologies that promise 
<br>
widespread &quot;cultural disintermediation&quot; are essential to this project.  
<br>
Making sure that control over those technologies doesn't end up in the hands 
<br>
of traditional authorities in Second and Third World societies is crucial.  
<br>
But working to make sure that there is a cultural infrastructure to accept 
<br>
billions of humans plugging into &quot;Earthweb&quot; is just as important.
