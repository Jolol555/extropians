Duncan Campbell talks to John Zerzan.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's the effort to understand and do away with every form of domination,
<br>
and that involves questioning very basic institutions, including the
<br>
division of labour and domestication upon which the whole edifice
<br>
of civilisation and technology rests ... If you took away division of
<br>
labour and domestication you might have something pretty close to what
<br>
obtained for the first two million years of the species, during which
<br>
there was leisure time, there was quite a lot of gender equality and
<br>
no organised violence - which doesn't sound too bad. They say: 'Oh,
<br>
you want to be a caveman.' Well, maybe that's somewhat true.&quot;
<br>
<p>[Obligatory editorial: Zerzan wanting to be a caveman is fine by
<br>
me. His wanting *everyone else* to be cavemen is another matter
<br>
entirely -- and it's implicit in his political program, which is
<br>
predicated on destroying our technological infrastructure. I don't
<br>
know about you, but in my case, I would be dead twice over and 
<br>
blind in one eye to boot, had modern medical techniques not been
<br>
available. Nor can I be sanguine about calls for a return to hunter-
<br>
gatherer lifestyles, given that I live on an island with 58 million
<br>
other people and a hunter-gatherer carrying capacity of maybe
<br>
half a million at most.]
