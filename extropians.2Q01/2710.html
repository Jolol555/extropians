Damien Broderick's right, &quot;head transplant&quot; is the wrong term.
<br>
It should be &quot;body transplant.&quot;
<br>
<p>And we're a tiny bit closer to being able to do it right, according to the
<br>
following news item.
<br>

<br>
<p>A gentle tug can turn nerve cells into cables for repairing spinal cords
<br>
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/newsletter/news.jsp?id=ns228739">http://www.newscientist.com/newsletter/news.jsp?id=ns228739</a>
<br>
<p>STRETCHING neurons on the rack might seem like torture, but it could be the
<br>
key to repairing spinal cords.
<br>
<p>By gradually pulling apart bunches of neurons, Douglas Smith and his
<br>
colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia have persuaded
<br>
the cells' processes, or axons, to grow up to a centimetre in just 10 days.
<br>
&quot;For an axon just a micron wide, that's an enormous distance,&quot; Smith says.
<br>
<p>The researchers say these nerve cells could be used to bridge the gap between
<br>
damaged nerves in the spinal cords of people who are paralysed. They have
<br>
already begun trials in animals. &quot;You can think about what we have as jumper
<br>
cables,&quot; Smith says.
<br>
<p>While it's too early to know if the approach will work for people with spinal
<br>
cord injuries, Smith thinks it is a viable alternative to other strategies.
<br>
For example, many researchers are trying to encourage nerve cells to regrow in
<br>
the spine by, say, implanting an artificial scaffold seeded with appropriate
<br>
chemicals.
<br>
<p>&quot;But everything about the spinal cord is screaming 'stop growing',&quot; Smith
<br>
says, so it's hard to get axons to grow long distances. &quot;The difference with
<br>
growing cells outside the body is that you don't have to worry about this
<br>
inhibitory environment.&quot;
<br>
<p>Smith's team placed groups of human neurons on adjacent membranes and grew
<br>
them for three days to allow the axons from the groups to form connections.
<br>
The membranes were then pulled apart 3.5 micrometres every 5 minutes over 10
<br>
days, until the axons connecting the two groups of cells had grown a
<br>
centimetre. Any faster and the axons were torn apart. They ended up with long
<br>
bundles containing tens of thousands of axons.
<br>
<p>It's an interesting approach, says Paul Reier, a pioneering researcher into
<br>
spinal cord repair at the University of Florida. The big problem will be
<br>
implanting the cells in the right place and keeping them alive, he says.
<br>
&quot;Adult neurons usually die when transplanted.&quot;
<br>
<p>But Smith says his team is using a cell line that managed to survive when
<br>
implanted into stroke patients. He also speculates that transplanting
<br>
integrated bundles of cells will boost their survival. &quot;Cells may be less
<br>
likely to die if they stay with their 'friends',&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>Reier thinks it will someday be possible to persuade cells to grow long
<br>
distances in the spinal cord, though. &quot;Axon growth is becoming less of a
<br>
challenge than we thought.&quot;
<br>
<p>Whatever approach is used, many questions remain. It's not even clear that
<br>
bridging a damaged part of the spinal cord will restore nerve activity. In
<br>
some injuries, some or all of the nerve fibres remain intact, yet still don't
<br>
work, Reier points out.
<br>
<p>Smith's work may also help us understand other disorders, however. He thinks
<br>
that stretch-induced growth plays an important role in embryos and children.
<br>
Some degenerative disorders in young children may be caused by nerve fibres
<br>
that can't grow fast enough to keep up. Smith's team is now trying to
<br>
understand exactly how the process works. &quot;Nobody's ever studied this type of
<br>
growth before,&quot; he says.
