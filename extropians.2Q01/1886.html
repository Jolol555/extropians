Jim Fehlinger wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt; ... It's certainly true that most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the talk about AI on this list has been in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software running on some sort of digital substrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (&quot;computronium&quot;, or whatever), but that's not the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way AI or SI could happen.
</em><br>
<p>We don't know (for sure) how it could happen.
<br>
For all we know, intelligence invariably reaches a level where it understands
<br>
that reality eternally repeats itself. From there, the cleverest strategy may
<br>
involve a hasty retreat back into forgetfulness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While digital integrated circuits might be the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glamorous electronics on the market these days, don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forget that there are still linear ICs being manufactured!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's altogether conceivable that a non-biological AI or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload could use molecular or nano-scale **linear** devices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as processing elements!  Such a contraption might not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite as tame inside as we probably visualize -- most of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably think of some sort of 3D crystalline lattice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotubes with nothing but electrons flashing around, and with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the action happening in software, rather than something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might look more like Babbage's (or Gibson and Sterling's)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Difference Engine, with gears and whirlygigs making and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breaking connections or aiming little laser beams around,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or scurrying nanobots.  Or what about an AI/SI made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of honest-to-God biological tissue, but freed from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confines of a human skull and serviced by nanobots (yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that idea gives me the creeps, too.  Too _Last and First
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Men_).
</em><br>
<p>It's also possible that the human brain forms 3D images by actually connecting
<br>
neurons in 3D patterns that map to sensory experience. Again, none of this
<br>
requires conjuring analog computation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I get the impression that's the way Kurzweil thinks AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will happen -- he talks about the brain as a &quot;digitally-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlled analog system&quot;, and I think he thinks we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to get to AI by reverse-engineering the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain.
</em><br>
<p>Not to misrepresent Kurzweil, but he probably knows that computers will do
<br>
most of the work when it comes to engineering human-competitive machine
<br>
intelligence. In fact, accurate reverse-engineering the human brain encourages
<br>
the implementation of many human-competitive expert systems working
<br>
collaboratively. AI will continue to develop from the &quot;collaboratory&quot; (check
<br>
out their site) of human invention and well-managed market forces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe a partly analog phase will be a necessary **transition**
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the way to all-digital AI and/or uploads
</em><br>
<p>But I no longer believe in analog computers, so for me, partly analog equates
<br>
to partly ludicrous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here's a deep question:  would an analog AI constructed out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of vacuum tubes have a &quot;mellower&quot; personality than one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made out of transistors?  ;-&gt;    ;-&gt;    ;-&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, because analog AI exists only in the mellow imaginations of 60s dreamers.
