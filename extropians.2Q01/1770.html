<p>I haven't read the Kauffman, but I can understand why you might
<br>
have that impression of _UoC_.  It's more abstract and mathematical
<br>
than Edelman's earlier books, but it contains two very interesting
<br>
points.  One is the necessity, in biological science, to come up with
<br>
a definition of &quot;information&quot; that does **not** rely on there being
<br>
a conscious observer (or homunculus) for whom the information is, well,
<br>
informative!  The phone company doesn't have this problem -- Claude
<br>
Shannon and his pals at Bell Labs were concerned with bandwidth
<br>
and noise and so forth in communication channels where there
<br>
was always assumed, very sensibly, to be a human being speaking into
<br>
one end and another one listening at the other.  The other thing
<br>
is that E. &amp; T. attempt to give what comes down to a **geometrical**
<br>
definition of qualia, as a particular configuration, in an N-dimensional
<br>
space, of neuronal groups related to each other by means of 
<br>
&quot;functional clustering&quot; and &quot;mutual information&quot;, which E. &amp; T. give
<br>
definitions of in terms of statistical entropy.
<br>
<p>If you want physicalist, you'd be better off to start with
<br>
_Bright Air, Brilliant Fire_.
