Sorry to see this delay in official approval for ultrawideband, a technology
<br>
that may play a role in connecting us and our personal area networks with
<br>
just about any device that could benefit from low cost, low power, typically
<br>
short range communication.
<br>
<p>- Jef
<br>
<p>Proponents of ultrawideband, a new technology for wireless transmissions,
<br>
face a longer wait for government approval after the Department of Commerce
<br>
on Friday revealed that it will need an additional three months to finish
<br>
critical interference tests.
<br>
The Federal Communications Commission is deciding whether to allow
<br>
widespread use of ultrawideband devices, which can transmit huge amounts of
<br>
data over the air using just a fraction of the power required by cell phones
<br>
or current wireless networking systems. The technology also can be used in
<br>
precision tracking devices and for X-ray-like radar that can peer through
<br>
walls.
<br>
But the low-power signals emitted by ultrawideband devices operate over a
<br>
wide swath of frequencies, including many already being used by existing
<br>
broadcast, radar and wireless communications systems. The Commerce
<br>
Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration was
<br>
tapped to conduct tests to determine whether ultrawideband devices would
<br>
interfere with existing critical systems like airport radar and global
<br>
positioning satellite receivers.
