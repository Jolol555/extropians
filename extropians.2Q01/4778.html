<em>&gt; Eliezer, did I misunderstand your comments from that thread? spike
</em><br>
<p>Hm, I don't recall this thread well enough to remember.  I would point
<br>
out, however, that this sounds like we were discussing the usefulness of
<br>
distributed Internet computing for *building* the AI, not the dynamic
<br>
*after* the seed AI gets started.  Anyway, I really doubt I said that
<br>
distributed computing was irrelevant.  What I may have said was that
<br>
Internet-distributed computing presents both obvious difficulties and
<br>
unobvious difficulties, which is why it wouldn't be such a great idea to
<br>
try to *develop* an AI distributed over the Internet, which was an idea
<br>
that I had briefly advocated before giving up on it.
