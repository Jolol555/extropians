I didn't quite realize how hostile people could be about these topics either
<br>
till this last weekend. Years ago back when the web was new, I used to enjoy
<br>
going to IRC and getting on #philosophy channel and listening to the debate,
<br>
and jumping in myself having a great time. It was wonderful. Well, I went
<br>
back and when I got on the channel again, there was a strange silence that
<br>
went on many mins. I then tried to spur things on by trying to discuss the
<br>
recent AI developments I knew about. At once, I was attacked by people...
<br>
Not with arguments, but completely unexpected responses, most saying &quot;go
<br>
away&quot;, &quot;this was stupid&quot;, &quot;machines suck&quot; (and this is candy coating a lot
<br>
of it). I found one single person in the channel that seemed to even
<br>
approach the subject so me and him/her chatted away a few while the rest of
<br>
the people took shots at me. The conversation led into more generalized
<br>
technological developments and as soon as I mentioned the recent time travel
<br>
possibility that just popped up, I was immediately disconnected by the Op
<br>
and BANNED!!! Have things gone so far that the average person cant stand to
<br>
even hear a potential breakthrough?! Or should I just chalk this up as the
<br>
unwashed masses have finally arrived and I was just expecting a bit more
<br>
from them? I can see this coming from a channel like #hottub or #partyzone,
<br>
but I get this response from the great intellectuals on the #philosophy
<br>
channel? What do we do with all these crazy people!!!!?
