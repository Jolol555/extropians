<p><em>&gt; OK, so basically you approve of a pay cap for domestic workers based on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global competition, because the domestic workers demand too much. This is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very much the view that I expected of those of a libertarian economic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy, and who is to say you are wrong? 
</em><br>
<p>The cap is not as significant as you might imagine.  I've got a
<br>
spreadsheet that details the overhead costs of employing offshore
<br>
workers.  The cost savings are *not* as significant as one might
<br>
presume at first glance.  (They do however justify the expenses
<br>
involved if you have a large enough project.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But all should be forced to compete in the global market. Why not bring in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million medical professionals to take care of us in the USA?
</em><br>
<p>Because the 'reverse costs' are significant.  Consider this --
<br>
in Russia currently, most people 'own' their apartments or Dachas.
<br>
In the U.S. that isn't typically true.  Bring those people to the U.S.
<br>
and they suddenly have huge rents or mortgages to pay.  Thus their
<br>
salary costs increase.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about Sweetheart deals could be set up between health insurance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies and pharmacy chains-halving costs?
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  Yes, you can cut the costs somewhat by becoming a partner
<br>
in distribution but most of the profit is going back to the manufacturer
<br>
(e.g. the big-Pharma-co) and they and the HIC are not looking at each
<br>
other with extreme fondness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This could apply to legal services also. I mean, why pay lawyers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of dollars when foreign attorneys could be much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inexpensive?
</em><br>
<p>Because the functioning of the legal systems is completely different!
<br>
You don't employ a Russian lawyer to navigate the U.S. legal
<br>
system and you don't employ an U.S. lawyer to navigate the
<br>
Russian legal system.  They are two entirely different species
<br>
and while the &quot;background training&quot; is similar the realities
<br>
of working in them are like night and day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Supposedly, 5.6 million new IT workers will be needed in the USA in the next 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5 years. Gates and company may have a point, if true. If not....? 
</em><br>
<p>I suspect these numbers were generated by the study firms to
<br>
satisfy their contracts.  (You don't think they hire study firms
<br>
to disprove the agendas of the people writing the checks do you???)
<br>
<p>This is selective filtering of the &quot;Horoscope Reality&quot; -- You hear
<br>
about the times it comes true but you never hear about the times
<br>
the predictions are false.  How many Human Resource Managers are
<br>
complaining to their congressmen about the fact that they have
<br>
too many resumes in their 'inbox'???
