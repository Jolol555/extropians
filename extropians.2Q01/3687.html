Personally, I think it's one of the good things about this list, as some of 
<br>
the items are those that I would otherwise miss, and it also helps to start 
<br>
off debates about current technological issues, scotching most claims that 
<br>
we are too &quot;future-focussed&quot;.
<br>
<p>So my stance on this issue is that I will continue to post to this list 
<br>
items of news I see as useful and informative to the group, until such time 
<br>
as everyone screams at me to stop it.
<br>
<p>On the topic of news items:)
<br>
<p>Found this on the Beeb font-of-all-knowledge-site;
<br>
<p>Anti-ageing breakthrough
<br>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_1305000/1305112.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_1305000/1305112.stm</a>
<br>
<p>A breakthrough in gene technology holds out the prospect of a more 
<br>
effective anti-ageing treatment.
<br>
It may also lead to new treatments to fight cancer.
<br>
Scientists from Newcastle University have found a way to enhance the body's 
<br>
natural repair mechanism.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
Perhaps when people see more items like this, esp. when linked to 
<br>
&quot;treatments to fight cancer&quot;, they will begin to warm to 
<br>
superlongevity?  I'd say most people would.  They just don't realize it yet.
<br>

<p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
