Excellent!
<br>
does anyone have an opinion on how to position oneself for this trend say.. 
<br>
financially, or career skills development?

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 2020, you'll still be able to tell what's real from what's not. 
<br>
But
<br>
by 2030, as tactile immersion is achieved, there will be &quot;no clear 
<br>
distinction
<br>
between virtual reality and reality,&quot; [Ray Kurzweil] said.
<br>
--------
<br>
The computer as we know it will become as obsolete as an 8-track cassette
<br>
because everything's getting smaller, Kurzweil said. Eventually, transistors
<br>
will be as small as a few atoms. Processing power is doubling every year. 
<br>
The
<br>
very near future holds &quot;ubiquitous high bandwidth.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As those factors merge, he said, we will be computing all the time,
<br>
though we won't use computers.
