[Robin posts a paper by him and Tyler Cowen on the implications of 
<br>
disagreements]

<br>
<p>I have no idea where to begin.  I'm having such trouble formulating coherent 
<br>
stuff these days.  I'm not going to quote from the paper as there's too much. 
<br>
&nbsp;I *strongly* recommend people read the paper, even if you have no interest 
<br>
in what I say.  <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf</a> or .doc
<br>
<p>I mean it.  Read the damn paper. <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf</a> or .doc 
<br>
(Robin, could you make a Web version?)
<br>
<p>I agree with the conclusion of the paper - that people form ideas for their 
<br>
personal benefit, not in search of truth.  If gene a induces carriers to seek 
<br>
truth and gene b to have more babies, which wins?  If meme a induces carriers 
<br>
to seek truth and meme b to proselytize, which wins?  Necessarily, we are 
<br>
constructed by entities whose goals need not include truth at all, and will 
<br>
include it only as a means to an end.  Science has constructed an elaborate 
<br>
set of principle to enhance truth-seeking such as hypothesize-test, peer 
<br>
review, and consideration of as many alternatives as possible.  The existence 
<br>
of the scientific method leads directly to two observations: 1) that it's 
<br>
needed in the first place and 2) that it is often inadequate.  Hence humans 
<br>
carry strong anti-truth biases.
<br>
<p>I think though, that the paper overlooks other limitations on human Bayesian 
<br>
behavior, primarily limited computational ability.  I would say most of the 
<br>
non-Bayesian behavior you outline can be explained by human inability to be a 
<br>
good Bayesian, as well as by the fact that  people aren't trying to be good 
<br>
Bayesians in the first place. 
<br>
<p>First, as I've said before, people aren't good Bayesians.  Being a good 
<br>
Bayesian requires logical omniscience.  People are very, very far from this, 
<br>
as explified by behavior in psychological cooperator/defector games.  People 
<br>
start off with &quot;obviously&quot; wrong actions - typically too cooperative, 
<br>
although that varies by game, and shift to proper behavior only with 
<br>
experience.  People are good Bayesians only when the situation is simple and 
<br>
they can manage the computation.
<br>
<p>Bayesian behavior is correct, of course, in the sense of vulnerability to 
<br>
Dutch book. Humans can't be good Bayesians, and they know it.  As a result, 
<br>
they take a logical route - they refuse Dutch book situations.  This is one 
<br>
of two reasons why group don't have to have group Bayesian behavior - groups 
<br>
typically refuse book.  If they had to place bets, they'd place them among 
<br>
themselves because they'd get better deals.  The other reason is that each 
<br>
member is typically interested in his own benefit - group be ****ed, he's 
<br>
going to make the best bet he can.
<br>
<p>Resolving disputes by commonizing prior is a cost-benefit negative.  Changing 
<br>
priors is horrendously expensive, in the sense that all those mind-expensive 
<br>
probability calculations must be redone.  At the same time there's no benefit 
<br>
- one prior is as good as another.  High cost, no benefit - of course people 
<br>
don't bother and agree to disagree.  The only time people will commonize 
<br>
priors is if they have too - say to participate in a market.  Non-Bayesian 
<br>
human behavior feeds into maintaining independent priors, as well.  If we 
<br>
were both good Bayesians I'd be more willing to accept your prior as an 
<br>
alternative to mine.  But I know that you don't want to be a good Bayesian 
<br>
and couldn't be if you tried.  I'd be a fool to swallow your priors, and vice 
<br>
versa.
<br>
<p>The John and Mary example also assumes John and Mary can efficiently exchange 
<br>
information.  This doesn't match human experience.  It's very hard to 
<br>
communicate experience - language is a low-capacity channel compared to 
<br>
eyeballs and fingertips.  Time is valuable.  John hasn't time to get all 
<br>
Mary's data, or vice versa.  There's also a significant risk to exchanging 
<br>
data.  Human memories are not tape recorders, but actively constructed.  To a 
<br>
certain extent, if Mary says she saw something, John will remember seeing it, 
<br>
even if he didn't.  Communication between people involves a certain amount of 
<br>
data loss due to this principle.  Sequential communication eventually 
<br>
converts data into urban legends, stuff that's particularly easy for humans 
<br>
to remember or pleasant to recount, with little or no connection to truth.  
<br>
<p>Robin and Tyler mention the predeliction of scientists to support their own 
<br>
theories even if evidence is against them.  This is logical behavior from the 
<br>
personal gain POV.  The inventor or popularizer of a new theory gains great 
<br>
benefit in science.  Supporters of existing theories gain little benefit.  
<br>
Hence novel theories *should* be supported by their inventors or 
<br>
rediscoverers, even if the evidence is against them, as long as evidence 
<br>
isn't *too* much against them.  Robin and Tyler explain scientific 
<br>
intransigence to group benefit from considering multiple alternatives, which 
<br>
is there, but selection on individuals explains more directly than that on 
<br>
groups.  I propose that the group would benefit more if people supported 
<br>
theories developed by other people, due to greater skepticism.  Hence I think 
<br>
the behavior exists primarily for individual, not group benefit.  
<br>
<p>Sorry my comments are so negative.  I really liked the paper.  But, you know, 
<br>
I gain little from accepting your conclusions and a lot if I get to put out 
<br>
something successful of my own ... :-)
