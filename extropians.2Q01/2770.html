<p><em>&gt;But the &quot;they&quot; that will pay are almost entirely those innocent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;keeping the spy plane/crew.  Isn't a basic tenet of morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around here that you don't punish the innocent?
</em><br>
<p>American citizens are blamed/punished/killed all the time for the
<br>
actions of the U.S government. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;P.S.  I don't see what's to get so riled up about.  Holding some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hostages in a hotel for two weeks is awfully mild compared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ongoing wars in Congo or Israel, to severe repression in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afghanistan, or even to the drug &quot;war&quot; in the US.  As to keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the spy plane, seriously, what do you expect?  The US would do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same if it had stuff to learn from their equipment.  If you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to induce good behavior throughout the world, there are scads of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more significant targets.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, fortunately our people are back safe. This does not excuse the
<br>
taking and holding of them in the first place.
<br>
<p>But the Chinese government is having a grand old time broadcasting
<br>
propaganda to it's people about us, propaganda I was suprised to
<br>
see the people so readily believing. Sorry, but if you or your
<br>
government talk bad about me, I don't trade with you.
<br>
<p>As to the plane, yep I expected them to keep it for as long as they
<br>
can, but if it's not back before the most favored nation trade
<br>
staus comes up for renewal, it should be denied.
<br>
<p>Surveillance missions should begin again, with armed fighters to
<br>
help maintain proper distances if necessary.
<br>
<p>You may wish to note that I am personally boycotting China (and
<br>
encouraging others) I am not calling for government action on a
<br>
boycott.
