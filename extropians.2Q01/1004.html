</em><br>
<p>You could always try it with test animals, having one group with no
<br>
special exercise and one that are induced to workout in various
<br>
ways. Then you can see what genes get expressed. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In this scenario the reason for going into space at all is simply that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, nice, give the Greens more ammunition why don't you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well at least the game should be popular in Germany.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it is a green nightmare - all of nature has turned out to be
<br>
artificial. It seems it was all some kind of biotech left by an alien
<br>
supercivilisation, and now some of the aliens are making a
<br>
comeback. The only thing saving people is high powered genetic
<br>
engineering, nanotech and geoengineering. Living in harmony with
<br>
nature means you (and your standard ecology) is going to be
<br>
assimilated ;-)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the people behind the space effort calculate that the value of owning a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sizeable fraction of all human living space would outweigh the risk of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; project failure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to be at the meeting where you get that many optimists (with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the necessary financial throw weight) in a room.
</em><br>
<p>It is the normal distribution thing - with a large population, you are
<br>
bound to find some extreme cases. Of course, the interesting thing to
<br>
see is if they manage to prove themselves sane and not just another
<br>
Iridium. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I agree that this is a somewhat weak case, but then again, it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; game. I try to make the science and economy as hard as suits the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; story, but I do fudge a little bit to make (more) interesting things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remind me at some future point when I've relocated elsewhere to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invite you to visit for a few days.  We'll make fudge together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so you can see how *sticky* it is.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds fun!
