</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those who serve in the military take an oath to defend not the

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; government has not the authority to repeal the first amendment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the second, or any of the Bill of Rights.  Right?
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe the military is trained to believe it has the
<br>
responsibility of deciding when the Constitution has been violated. 
<br>
Enforcing the Constitution is a job that has currently been taken over by
<br>
the Supreme Court.  I get the impression that if the U.S. turns into a
<br>
dictatorship, it is not the military's job to stop it - which is the way
<br>
things should be, if you ask me.  I suppose that if an individual
<br>
President went bughouse and tried to establish a dictatorship the military
<br>
might feel that they were obliged to disobey orders until Congress and the
<br>
Vice-President declare him incompetent, but I get the impression that's
<br>
around it - i.e., that the responsibility to defend the Constitution is
<br>
limited to respecting the Constitutional distribution of military
<br>
authority, rather than defending the Bill of Rights.
