<em>&gt; &gt; Extropians is a forum for exchange of ideas about the future,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and it is also an ongoing party of sorts.  Many pleasant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acquaintances in RL start here.

</em><br>
<p>Sure.  In fact the original post in this thread by Brian Atkins
<br>
has caused me to have an epiphany.  Loosely paraphrasing,
<br>
He suggested a reputation quotient to help improve the
<br>
quality of the list.
<br>
<p>For the purposes of this discussion, I will ignore the fact
<br>
that Pirsig (or rather Phaedrus) went mad trying to define
<br>
Quality.  The epiphany was in response to pondering the
<br>
fact that it was Sasha who suggested just such a reputation
<br>
rating system several years ago, then my own recollection
<br>
that Sasha was a chess enthusiast.  He and I had connected
<br>
offlist and were going to play a match by email, then decided
<br>
to meet at E4 for some fivers.  To my eternal regret, I
<br>
failed to make that happen, since I rode a motorcycle
<br>
up to Berkeley and didn't bring my board.
<br>
<p>In tournament chess, there is a thing called an Elo rating
<br>
that describes one's strength.  Sasha may have had this
<br>
in mind when he proposed his system which is in some
<br>
ways analogous to a reputation rating. Since I am tired I
<br>
will describe it only in general terms this evening, the Elo
<br>
system and how it could be adapted for our purposes.
<br>
<p>In tournament chess, one's Elo rating describes one's
<br>
strength.  A typical club player is about 1500, and a
<br>
standard deviation is about 200 points.  A 200 point
<br>
span defines a rank.  The ranks are these:
<br>
<p>rank                    Elo rating
<br>
<p>1000-1200        E
<br>
1200-1400        D
<br>
1400-1600        C
<br>
1600-1800        B
<br>
1800-2000        A
<br>
2000-2200        expert
<br>
2200-2400        master
<br>
2400+               grandmaster
<br>
<p>If I play a person two full ranks above me, she is
<br>
two standard deviations above or about 97.5% likelihood
<br>
she will go home with my scalp, rather than the reverse.
<br>
Nowthen, if I do manage to topple her, I gain a lotta
<br>
Elo points.  The exact formulas later, if this thread
<br>
stirs interest.
<br>
<p>The Elo system is set up to where there is no rate
<br>
inflation over the years.  And it works, so that if
<br>
one stays the same in strength, one's rating does
<br>
not change much.  It does have good predictive
<br>
value in tournaments, or rather used to, before
<br>
computers came along.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, if we had an somewhat analogous
<br>
with extropian poster reputation.  Each person
<br>
would be rated from -2 to 5, where 5 is a person
<br>
who you read every post and -2 is you have
<br>
killfiled that person.  You would assign numbers
<br>
to each person in the matrix.
<br>
<p>Oh dear, it is late and Im tired.  More later.
