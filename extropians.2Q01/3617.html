<p>Hi Aleks. Trouble is, if you ask the average software developer whether
<br>
he'll need three order of magnitude faster computers, and he'll look at
<br>
you askance. For many of them computers are plenty fast already.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; many have been burned by providing something that was eventually not supported.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Practically nobody will throw a technology on the market without knowing how it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be used. Even fascinating technologies such as FPGA are marginalized,
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the debacles are many, and well documented. Shrinking profit margins
<br>
make for highly risk aversive R&amp;D.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; because they're too radical. And in any case, before you implement something in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware, it has to be simulated and demonstrated in software.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is high prototyping costs of modern hardware. It is the
<br>
pipeline setup time if you're running a new design through the fab. 
<br>
Modern foundries can't afford to goof around with outlandish 
<br>
architectures. They're trying to keep the production capabilities 
<br>
saturated with cash chips, and gather whatever profits there are 
<br>
left for the war chest, i.e. legal battles, economical maneuvring 
<br>
and putting the rest into surefire returns, such as developing 
<br>
your next line of products, in structure shrinks and touching 
<br>
finishes on core logic. Nevertheless, judging from the job alerts 
<br>
of a single foundry (I track Infineon), they're gearing up to do 
<br>
a lot with embedded RAM designs, and preparing for nonvolatile 
<br>
memories. 
<br>
<p>More minimal cores like StrongARM do dominate the deep embedded
<br>
market, and they're seeming to be considered as good candidates
<br>
for very large clusters due to their better OPS/Watt performance,
<br>
as well as handheld (-&gt;wearable) market. Google has just doubled 
<br>
their capacities to include 8 k nodes. At this cluster sizes 
<br>
footprint, energy consumption and air conditioning costs become
<br>
the biggest numbers on the budget, apart from people, of course.
<br>
<p>Message passing hardware support is moving into next generation
<br>
of consumer processors (AMDs HyperTransport), so things do move.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An interesting challenge is how to work well with architectures such as CA's.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right now it seems that they're used either as a machine code equivalent for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic expressed as &quot;traditional&quot; serial code, or for evolved computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circuits. It seems to me that a new generation of significantly more
</em><br>
<p>There are two principally different ways of implementing CAs in hardware:
<br>
as embedded RAM, or hardwiring the individual cells. Embedded RAM implementations
<br>
optimize for cell density, and allow you to use higher dimensions, allowing
<br>
you to use e.g. 3d lattices with their shorter average distances, and
<br>
more space to lay around the signalling pipework. But they're relatively 
<br>
slow, because they're updated more or less sequentially. Hardwiring the 
<br>
individual cells gives you blazing speed, but limits you to the plane.
<br>
<p>Hardware CAs are sufficiently lunatic fringe that I would attempt to make 
<br>
them accept silicon compiler output with as little tweaking as possible. 
<br>
I.e. use registers, wires, and blocks of logics mapped to the CA grid, 
<br>
with the benefit of deterministic, quantized signal behaviour.
<br>
<p>Of course this is grave substrate underutilization, but it gets your foot
<br>
into the door. And once foundries output these wafers, you can introduce
<br>
variations (use more or less state per cell, change the rule, change
<br>
the neighbourhood) with much less costs, and allow you tailoring for
<br>
other paradigms entirely, without not changing the hardware visibly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; sophisticated tools are required to take advantages of notions like heuristics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or modules.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt; I generally agree. The main dilemma is how many heuristics should people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide -- on one hand there might be genetic algorithms, on the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand-coded &quot;intelligence&quot;. My position is somewhere in between, as I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yours too.
</em><br>
<p>I'm actually pretty much at the extreme side, pro using as much GA 
<br>
messiness as it is humanly possible. The modularization (which is 
<br>
clearly present in biological systems) should emerge naturally, and 
<br>
not be human meddling handiwork. It might be funny to submit human 
<br>
designs into the genetic soup, though, and see what might evolve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Minsky had a nice way of saying it, something along these lines: if natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution of intelligence took 200 million years, common sense and reason might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take far less. The quest is for the most efficient approach (thus realistically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feasible), not the simplest theoretically feasible.
</em><br>
<p>I'm all for the practical approach, but the product of skills, time
<br>
and hardware at my disposal doesn't allow me to do anything funky.
<br>
Perhaps I should wait for these desktop nanolithoprinters I mentioned.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I hope you like it in there, where you're sitting. I've been there myself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; briefly, but thankfully, have gotten better since.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not quite understand what you mean here. Could you explain?
</em><br>
<p>Apologies for the flippant comment. I thought you were a strong AI adherent
<br>
such as Eliezer. I was referring to the time when I read Elaine Rich,
<br>
Hofstadter and Minsky, and all kinds of weird AI journals, and believed 
<br>
their approach was not sterile. This was about 15 years ago. Then I got
<br>
a bad case of cellular automata, complexity, resulting in processing of
<br>
lots of dead tree labeled with Fredkin, Toffioli, Holland, Koza, Kauffman, 
<br>
Wolfram, and their illustrous ilk. I still haven't recovered yet. 
<br>
I'm looking for other infections material, but so far haven't found
<br>
much. Maybe I've become immune, that would be a pity.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We don't need no compilation//we don't need no flow control.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even we monkeys have multiple layers of behavior control, some are reflexive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast, others are reflective and flexible.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. But we don't have kLoCs inside us, nor sequential threads of control
<br>
(funny that consciousness should seem to absurdly sequential to introspection),
<br>
and generally do not suffer from privilege violations. I think computers should
<br>
be more like monkeys, not the other way round.
