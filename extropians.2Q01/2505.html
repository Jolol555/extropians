<p><em>&gt;Its funny, when the jobs being exported were resource recovery
</em><br>
<em>&gt;jobs, like mining, agriculture, lumber, etc, there was not such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;big hew and cry from the unions, since cheap resources meant more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manufacturing jobs and higher pay for those manufacturing jobs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The unions are stuck now, because now the third world is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developing, and they are developing manufacturing base that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cutting into their core membership, while the unions are finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it difficult to migrate into the info-worker market, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;info-workers tend to be far more informed, intelligent, educated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and independent minded than manufacturing laborers, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;info-labor market is a sellers market, where manufacturing-labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was a buyer's market for decades due to high immigration. We don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need unions to make good money in high-tech. So, consequently, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unions are doing anything they can to make it more difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ship more manufacturing jobs overseas.
</em><br>
<p>Mike, I've been a Union member for almost 20 years, and I sit
<br>
typing this in the core of one of the highest tech data/routing
<br>
centers in the U.S. and I built and run every network here.
<br>
<p>There are two very different types of Unions, the Industrial Unions
<br>
where you become a member just by being hired, and the craft Unions
<br>
where you have to serve an apprenticeship, got to school, pass
<br>
tests, and actually know something.
<br>
<p>I sit here typing less than two blocks from the infamous haymarket
<br>
square where Union members were framed and killed for trying to
<br>
establish the 8 hour workday.
<br>
<p>The simple fact of the matter is that everything modern workers
<br>
enjoy, from the eight hour workday, overtime pay, 40 hour workdays,
<br>
etc,etc,etc, was earned for the American worker by UNION labor.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It's unfortunate for them that manufacturing robots are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent, otherwise the unions would look to them for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;membership... ;)
</em><br>
<p>Most of the people who install and repair them are. ;)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;Every nation's industry must go through a sweatshop phase to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;develop, and frankly, the majority of the charges you hear about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'sweatshops' is bogus spin doctoring by unions and other labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agitators.
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense, sweatshops are not essential to industrialisation
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Nah, efficient resource utilization (to prevent malthusian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meltdown prior to the singularity) demands maximizing comparative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advantage. Family run dairy farms in Vermont are cute and fun for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the tourists, but frankly, I don't give a crap where my milk came
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from, so long as it's not diseased and it's as cheap as possible.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, to each his own. I personally try to do as much of my
<br>
business as possible as close to home as possible. I find it hard
<br>
to live in peace if my neighbors suffer.
