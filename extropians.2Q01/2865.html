Charlie forwards:

<em>&gt; See <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,476639,00.html">http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,476639,00.html</a>

<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But more important is a stimulating environment, which makes people think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;more, prompting them to choose yet more stimulation. The smarter you are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the more likely you are to enjoy books, puzzles and challenging jobs. That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in turn gets your brain working more and you choose even higher levels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of stimulation in a virtuous circle of intelligence. 'Higher IQ leads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;one to better environments, causing still higher IQ,' said the report.
</em><br>
<p>This explanation doesn't make that much sense to me.  The Flynn effect is
<br>
cross-generational.  It's not that an individual's IQ goes up as he gets
<br>
older, as this paraphrased explanation seems to suggest.
<br>
<p>It would have to be that smarter parents provide more stimulating toys
<br>
and environments for their children, making them smarter, and then when
<br>
they grow to be parents they buy even more stimulating toys for their own
<br>
children.  But does that make sense?  Each generation choosing slightly
<br>
more stimulating toys for their children, just because the parents are
<br>
a bit smarter (like 5 IQ points)?  Would the degree of stimulation of
<br>
toys chosen correlate that well with parental intelligence?  This doesn't
<br>
seem likely.
<br>
<p>Also, if this explanation were correct it could just as easily explain
<br>
falling IQs.  Each generation is slightly dumber, causing it to choose
<br>
slightly less stimulating toys for its children.  An explanation which
<br>
works just as well for the opposite of the phenomenon it purports to
<br>
explain is not very promising.
<br>
<p>I think you need to introduce the notion that technology is making the
<br>
world inherently more stimulating.  It's not that people are choosing
<br>
more challenges, it's that the world is a more challenging place.
<br>
With modern communications - first widespread literacy and newspapers,
<br>
then the telegraph, telephone, recorded music, movies, television and
<br>
now the internet - each generation is being exposed to more information.
<br>
Given the increased complexity of the world, the explanation above begins
<br>
to make sense (and I should note that it has been widely discussed in
<br>
the past, here on this list at least).
