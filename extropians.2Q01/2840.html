<p>I assume other parts of the world have a Fry's Electronics or
<br>
something analogous to it nearby?  Fry's is a supermarket for
<br>
gadgetry, acres and acres of the stuff.  The most valuable real
<br>
estate in that place is the display one passes immediately upon
<br>
entering the store.  They show thre the latest hot selling item,
<br>
usually something cheap, that is flying off the shelf, such as a
<br>
battery powered clock that sets itself via a radio signal,
<br>
something that would be nice to have around the house.
<br>
<p>Ive noticed that this coveted spot for the last few months has
<br>
been occupied by those little X10 wireless cameras that we
<br>
discussed here about last summer.  They are cheap enough,
<br>
about 70 bucks, that anyone might buy one on a whim, without
<br>
a clear application in mind.  They are not the greatest picture
<br>
quality, but good enough, and you can set one anywhere,
<br>
transmit the signal to a VCR, rig it with a motion detector,
<br>
etc, make a nice little poor man's security system.
<br>
<p>Back to Fry's, I went in the other day looking for a Rocket
<br>
e-book, stood around and watched for a few minutes.  Several
<br>
people picked up an X10 camera.  I would estimate they sold
<br>
one every 2 to 4 minutes, during heavy crowds, so just a
<br>
conservative guess they must be selling a few hundred of these
<br>
a day.  Open 7 days a week, and the display has been there
<br>
for at least 4 months, you figure there are tens of thousands
<br>
of these little wireless cameras now out there just from that
<br>
one Fry's store, and we have 4 other stores that size inside
<br>
a 15 km radius.
<br>
<p>Where are all these cameras now?  spike
