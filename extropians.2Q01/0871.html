<em>&gt; 1)  What open source language do we use?
</em><br>
<p>Something that everyone who wants to use the package is familiar with.
<br>
<p>Maybe as Gene said, we make a bunch of components. How about Corba
<br>
components? Then someone can serve them, and everyone can access them.
<br>
<p>Only problem is, that this requires somebody to cough up a server to do the
<br>
dirty work; I am assuming that often the computation will be kind of large.
<br>
<p>Something entirely client side would put the load back on the user, which is
<br>
probably fairer, but not efficient.
<br>
<p>How about a P2P solution? Everyone who wants to use this thing also makes
<br>
themselves available to process work for others?
<br>
<p>So you'd get an architecture where you download a bunch of components from a
<br>
central server, install them locally, as well as a P2P program which handles
<br>
communication between client code and servers (yourself included) for
<br>
processing.
<br>
<p>User environment of choice
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
<br>
Local Wrapper (eg: COM interface for Windows users)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
<br>
P2P front end (manages farming out requests)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||| (communication between local or remote front/back ends)
<br>
P2P back end (receives incoming requests and reports results)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
<br>
Raw Processing Components
<br>
<p><p>Urgghh... spreadsheet is starting to sound good again
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2)  How is this software package to be accessed?
</em><br>
<p>With server hosted components, you could use Corba to access them.
<br>
<p>With that P2P architecture, you get an appropriate local interface for any
<br>
tools that  you want to use. As long as someone codes it up :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3)  What architecture?
</em><br>
<p>See horribly complex architecture above
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4)  Are there existing open source components that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we could incorporate?
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5)  Are we looking a simulation of some sort?
</em><br>
<p>???
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6)  What kind of user interface?  Graphic?  etc.
</em><br>
<p>Anything with nice clicky buttons and spinning icons :-)
