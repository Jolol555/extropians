I found it interesting how the author divided up the combatants in the book as the &quot;party of yeah!&quot; and the &quot;party of nah.&quot;  When he described the party of yeah I thought to myself how he probably was at least nominally aware of extropians.  
<br>
<p>A sort of &quot;highfive&quot; was mentioned as the salute of the party of yeah group.  Again, it made me think of the extropian salute(is it officially used at Extro's?).
<br>
<p>I read the chapters which interested me the most while sitting in a comfortable chair at my local Barnes &amp; Nobles.  I think the way the book closely looks at whether the new new economy is really benefitting everyone is well done.  Even the &quot;negative&quot; counterarguments he offers up to balance things are worth reading.  
<br>
<p>I hope this book is widely read by those on the list.  It would definitely be worthy of a thread here.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
