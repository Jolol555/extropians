<p>Scientists predict Moon base by 2007
<br>
<p>BY MARK HENDERSON, SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT
<br>
<p>MAN could return to the Moon to set up a permanent base by 2007 at half the 
<br>
cost of building the International Space Station, a Nasa scientist said 
<br>
yesterday.
<br>
A lunar space station staffed by four astronauts would offer unprecedented 
<br>
opportunities to advance human understanding of the Universe at an 
<br>
affordable price and should be a priority for Nasa and the European Space 
<br>
Agency, Paul Spudis told the National Astronomy Meeting in Cambridge.
<br>
<p>Dr Spudis, from the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas, said 
<br>
that such a project was already technically feasible and could be 
<br>
accomplished within six years of gaining approval from politicians and 
<br>
funding bodies. It would cost an estimated $50 billion (£35 billion) — less 
<br>
in real terms than the $25 billion spent on the Apollo Moon missions of the 
<br>
1960s and 1970s.
<br>
<p>Once established, an international base would house powerful telescopes to 
<br>
take advantage of the Moon’s lack of atmosphere and clouds and allow 
<br>
detailed surveys of the surface. It would also provide an ideal test bed for 
<br>
technology that might one day sustain astronauts on a mission to Mars.
<br>
<p>“There are certain scientific goals that can only be accomplished by sending 
<br>
humans into space,” Dr Spudis said. “The experiments require human 
<br>
intelligence to perform. A return to the Moon would give us a natural 
<br>
laboratory for planetary science and a unique astronomical observing 
<br>
platform on which to set up instruments. There are few earthquakes and there 
<br>
is no wind, cloud or rain. Astronomers can examine the skies constantly and 
<br>
without atmospheric interference.”
<br>
<p>He said that the Moon base should be situated on the rim of Shackleton’s 
<br>
crater, near the “south pole”. The location had nearby ice deposits which 
<br>
could be mined as a source of water and oxygen; it also had a stable, if 
<br>
cold (-50C) temperature, and a long, sunlit day allowing the prolonged use 
<br>
of solar panels.
<br>
<p>The first team of four astronauts, who would stay for an initial 45 days, 
<br>
would set up a permanent living module buried under the Moon’s surface to 
<br>
shield from solar radiation. That could then be used by future missions, 
<br>
which would take new modules and experiments to expand the station.
<br>
<p>Scientists would use the base to build on the knowledge gleaned from the 
<br>
Apollo missions, the last of which landed on the Moon in 1972. A base would 
<br>
pave the way for a future manned mission to Mars. “The lessons we learn 
<br>
through life on the Moon would be invaluable,” Dr Spudis said.
<br>
<p>Ian Crawford, an astronomer at University College London, agreed that a 
<br>
return to the Moon should be a priority, but Andrew Coates, of the Mullard 
<br>
Space Science Laboratory at University College, said that money would be 
<br>
better invested in robotic probes. “I would love to send people, but I am 
<br>
worried about the cost and about whether they would survive,” he said. He 
<br>
thought that $50 billion was a “huge underestimate” and was concerned about 
<br>
the effects of cosmic radiation.
