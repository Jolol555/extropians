&lt; Lee Smolin gave the longest and most substantial response. He describes a
<br>
third possible form of information processing which is neither analog
<br>
(because it is based on discrete rather than continuous components) nor
<br>
digital (because it cannot be simulated by a digital computer algorithm).
<br>
His information storage is based on the topological structure of finite
<br>
graphs in three-dimensional space. This illustrates the general statement
<br>
that the categories of analog and digital are too narrow to cover the range
<br>
of possible machines and organisms. It is possible that Smolin's topological
<br>
information processing may actually exist, both in living cells and in the
<br>
fine-structure of space-time.&gt;

&lt; We base our own approach on what we call `cellular networks', consisting
<br>
of cells (nodes) interacting with each other via bonds (figuring as
<br>
elementary interactions) according to a certain `local law'. Geometrically
<br>
our dynamical networks are living on graphs. Hence a substantial amount of
<br>
the investigation is devoted to the developement of various versions of
<br>
discrete (functional) analysis and geometry on such (almost random) webs.
<br>
Another important topic we address is a suitable concept of intrinsic
<br>
(fractal) dimension on erratic structures of this kind. In the course of the
<br>
investigation we make comments concerning both different and related
<br>
approaches to quantum gravity as, say, the spin network framework. It may
<br>
perhaps be said that certain parts of our programme seem to be a realisation
<br>
of ideas sketched by Smolin some time ago. &gt;

&lt; We may note that if the Hilbert space is not constructible, we cannot ask
<br>
if this procedure is unitary. But we can still normalize the amplitudes so
<br>
that the sum of the absolute squares of the amplitudes to evolve from any
<br>
spin network to its successors is unity. This gives us something weaker than
<br>
unitarity, but strong enough to guarantee that probability is conserved
<br>
locally in the space of configurations.
<br>
To summarize, in such an approach, the amplitude to evolve from the initial
<br>
spin network W_0 to any element of S^N [W_0] , for large finite N is
<br>
computable, even if it is the case that the spin networks cannot be
<br>
classified so that the basis itself is not finitely specifiable. Thus, such
<br>
a procedure gives a way to do quantum physics even for cases in which the
<br>
Hilbert space is not constructible.
<br>
We may make two comments about this form of resolution of the problem.
<br>
First, it necessarily involves an element of time and causality. The way in
<br>
which the amplitudes are constructed in the absence of a specifiable basis
<br>
or Hilbert structure requires a notion of successor states. The theory never
<br>
has to ask about the whole space of states, it only explores a finite set of
<br>
successor states at each step. Thus, a notion of time is necessarily
<br>
introduced. 
<br>
Second, we might ask how we might formalize such a theory. The role of the
<br>
space of all states is replaced by the notion of the successor states of a
<br>
given network. The immediate successors to a graph Gamma_0 may be called the
<br>
adjacent possible. They are finite in number and constructible. They replace
<br>
the idealization of all possible states that is used in ordinary quantum
<br>
mechanics. We may note a similar notion of an adjacent possible set of
<br>
configurations, reachable from a given configuration in one step, plays a
<br>
role in formalizations of the self-organization of biological and other
<br>
complex systems. 
<br>
In such a formulation there is no need to construct the state space a
<br>
priori, or equip it with a structure such as an inner product. One has
<br>
simply a set of rules by which a set of possible configurations and
<br>
histories of the universe is constructed by a finite procedure, given any
<br>
initial state. In a sense it may be said that the system is constructing the
<br>
space of its possible states and histories as it evolves.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
There are further implications for theories of cosmology, if it turns out to
<br>
be the case that their configuration space or state space is not finitely
<br>
constructible. One is to the problem of whether the second law of
<br>
thermodynamics applies at a cosmological scale. If the configuration space
<br>
or state space is not constructible, then it is not clear that the ergodic
<br>
hypothesis is well defined or useful. Neither may the standard formulations
<br>
of statistical mechanics be applied. What is then needed is a new approach
<br>
to statistical physics based only on the evolving set of possibilities
<br>
generated by the evolution from a given initial state. It is possible to
<br>
speculate whether there may in such a context be a ³fourth law² of
<br>
thermodynamics in which the evolution extremizes the dimension of the
<br>
adjacent possible, which is the set of states accessible to the system at
<br>
any stage in its evolution. &gt;

is, perhaps, more rigorous than the one
<br>
&quot;Three roads to quantum gravity, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2000&quot;.
<br>
by Lee Smolin, which is more speculative.
<br>
&quot;Topos Theory&quot; has been invented, independently,
<br>
by Grothendieck, in the field of agebraic geometry,
<br>
and Lawvere, in the field of the foundation of mathematics.
