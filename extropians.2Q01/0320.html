<p>Think big. Go matter-antimatter or muon catralyzed fusion steam.

Constant one gee. Whee!

<p>Not at the opening date... At the opening date of the game, have them
<br>
use lox-kerosene. :)
<br>
<p>And be sure to include space rot for facilities/equipment that stay
<br>
operational long enough. You have probably heard about the space plaque
<br>
(mold+bacteria colonies on Mir's exterior, that eat quartz and
<br>
titanium--not the plaque on Voyager...)? I am wondering if the damage is
<br>
exacerbated by free singlet oxygen (prevalent at those altitudes
<br>
IIRC)...
