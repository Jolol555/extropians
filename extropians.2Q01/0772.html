<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Researchers discover a mechanism of cancer chemoprevention
<br>
<p>Despite a few recent seemingly contradictory studies featured in the
<br>
media, it is generally accepted that vegetables and fruits confer a
<br>
preventive benefit against the development of cancer. Their mechanism of
<br>
action was once believed to be that of the antioxidants such as
<br>
beta-carotene and vitamin C which many of them contain, however the past
<br>
few decades have witnessed the identification of specific phytochemicals
<br>
within many plants that appear to have an anticancer effect. How they
<br>
exert this effect was the subject of two studies that appeared in the
<br>
March 13 2001 issue of the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of
<br>
Sciences (PNAS) and an accompanying commentary. In one study, conducted at
<br>
Johns Hopkins University, researchers defined the role of the gene nrf2,
<br>
believed to be involved in the induction of phase 2 enzymes such as
<br>
glutathione S-transferases and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase which exert
<br>
a protective effect against carcinogens. Mice lacking the nrf2 gene showed
<br>
increased sensitivity to the carcinogen benzopyrene and an inability of
<br>
oltipraz, an anticancer substance found in cabbage, to protect them. In
<br>
control mice, oltipraz reduced the number of gastric tumors by 55%
<br>
compared to mice lacking the gene. It was found that the control mice
<br>
experienced a significant induction of phase 2 enzymes, whereas mice
<br>
lacking nrf2 had almost none. This demonstrates the role of nrf2 in the
<br>
induction of these protective enzymes as well as reconfirms the role of
<br>
oltipraz in cancer prevention. It was noted that because of their
<br>
mechanism of action, the effects of the chemopreventive agents are likely
<br>
to be longer lasting, necessitating less frequent dosing to derive their
<br>
benefits.
<br>
<p>In the PNAS commentary, the author explores the understanding of plants'
<br>
chemopreventive ability. Phase 1 cytochrome p450 enzymes detoxify in a
<br>
manner which eliminates the majority of toxins, but the reaction can  in
<br>
some cases activate the chemical into a toxin or cancer-causing mutagen.
<br>
Phase 2 enzymes then detoxify these resultant chemicals. Research has
<br>
indicated that the mechanism of action of the cancer preventive chemicals
<br>
in plants is itself that of a toxin or an imitation of one. The toxic
<br>
molecules in plants evolved as their defense against predators and our
<br>
adaptive response evolved because we ate these plants. These molecules
<br>
activate our detoxification enzymes and can affect our response to other
<br>
toxins and carcinogens.
<br>
<p>One might speculate that since phytochemicals such as oltipraz could
<br>
potentially be toxins, there might be a dose at which their benefit in
<br>
protecting against cancer is exceeded by their own toxicity.
<br>
<p>Research team member Paul Talalay, MD summarized, &quot;The new work is a
<br>
result of 20 years' research and confirms that raising the levels of phase
<br>
2 enzymes can offer a highly effective way to achieve protection against
<br>
carcinogenesis.&quot;
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Reconsideration suggested for heparin as antimetastatic agent
<br>
<p>Heparin is a well known anticoagulant drug used in the treatment of blood
<br>
clots and heart attack, as well as prophylactically in some cases to
<br>
prevent clotting during and after surgery. Studies in mice with cancer
<br>
have shown that heparin administration leads to decreased metastasis and
<br>
prolonged survival, but heparin's antimetastatic mechanism remained
<br>
unelucidated. Tumor spread in mice occurs through the formation of
<br>
complexes of tumor cells with white blood cells and platelets, which are
<br>
blood cells necessary for clotting, but heparin's effects in preventing
<br>
metastasis are not primarily due to its anticlotting ability. It was found
<br>
that heparin inhibits P-selectin-mediated interactions of platelets with a
<br>
substance called mucin on the cancer cell surface. The study's researchers
<br>
noted that while a single dose of heparin only prevented this interaction
<br>
for a few hours, it was found to prevent longterm metastasis when the mice
<br>
were examined six weeks later. Similar results were seen in another
<br>
experiment in which heparinized mice examined twelve weeks following tumor
<br>
injection, demonstrating that metastasis was prevented, not just delayed.

<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Thrombosis prevention by Calin V Pop, MD
<br>
<p>In patients affected with different tumors, disorders concerning blood
<br>
clotting are frequently observed. The biological processes leading to
<br>
coagulation are probably involved in the mechanisms of metastasis. About
<br>
50% of all cancer patients, and up to 95% of those with metastatic
<br>
disease, show some abnormalities--a prethrombotic state--in the
<br>
coagulation-fibrinolytic system. Thromboembolic complications are seen in
<br>
up to 11% of cancer patients, and hemorrhage occurs in about 10%.
<br>
Thromboembolism and hemorrhage, as a whole, are the second most common
<br>
cause of death after infection.
<br>
<p>In one study, subclinical changes in the coagulation-fibrinolytic system
<br>
were frequently detected in lung cancer patients. Five conventional tests
<br>
and one new test of blood coagulation--that is, platelet count (P),
<br>
prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen (F),
<br>
and D-dimer of fibrin (DD)--were prospectively recorded in a series of 286
<br>
patients with new primary lung cancer. A prethrombotic state (depicted by
<br>
a prolongation of PT, PTT, and increase of D-dimer of fibrin) was
<br>
significantly associated with an adverse outcome.
<br>
<p>Anticoagulant treatment of cancer patients, particularly those with lung
<br>
cancer, has been reported to improve survival. These interesting, although
<br>
preliminary, results of controlled trials lent some support to the
<br>
argument that activation of blood coagulation plays a role in the natural
<br>
history of tumor growth. Recently, two studies compared the effectiveness
<br>
of standard heparin with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the
<br>
treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In both studies, mortality rates
<br>
were lower in the patients randomized to LMWH. The analysis of these
<br>
deaths reveals a striking difference in cancer-related mortality.
<br>
<p>Cancer-related mortality with standard heparin was 31%, versus 11% with
<br>
low molecular weight heparin. This difference cannot solely be attributed
<br>
to thrombotic or bleeding events. Since large numbers of cancer patients
<br>
were included in the studies, it seems unlikely that ones with more
<br>
advanced tumors were present in the standard heparin group. While it also
<br>
is possible that standard heparin increases cancer mortality, such an
<br>
adverse effect has not been previously reported. These considerations
<br>
suggest that low molecular weight heparin might exert an inhibitory effect
<br>
on tumor growth. If your oncologist will not test for thrombotic risk
<br>
factors, contact the Life Extension Foundation at (800) 544-4440.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
Phytofood
<br>
<p>The discovery of cancer preventing phytochemicals has prompted The Life
<br>
Extension Foundation to create a new multi-vegetable powder to provide
<br>
concentrated doses of plant extracts that are well documented to reduce
<br>
the risk of many forms of cancer.
<br>
<p>Broccoli contains some of the most effective cancer preventing compounds
<br>
including sulphoraphane, phenethylisothiocyanate, indole-3-carbinol and
<br>
chlorophyll. Tomatoes contain p-coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid and
<br>
lycopene. Cabbage contains 3-indole-carbinol, oltipraz, brassinin and
<br>
phenethyl isothiocyanate. Parsley has been shown to boost liver production
<br>
of glutathione-S-transferase, which detoxifies synthetic chemical
<br>
carcinogens. Carrots contain beta- carotene and xanthophyll. A Candadian
<br>
study has shown that eating carrots reduced the incidence of breast cancer
<br>
in post-menopausal women. Another study published in Japan has shown that
<br>
eating carrots reduced the risk of breast and cervical cancer in younger
<br>
women.

<p>Grape seed-skin extract
<br>
<p>One of nature's most potent antioxidants are the proanthocyanidins.
<br>
Highlights of the product are as follows:
<br>
<p>1. Proanthocyanidins contain 95% oligomeric proanthocyanidins of free
<br>
grape seed extract (11% higher content than pycnogenol and free from
<br>
solvent residues).
<br>
2. They are powerful, natural and hypoallergenic free radical scavengers
<br>
and antioxidants.
<br>
3. They are a highly bioavailable bioflavonoid complex which is rapidly
<br>
absorbed and distributed throughout the body within minutes.
<br>
4. They have fifty times greater antioxidant capability than vitamin E and
<br>
twenty times greater activity than vitamin C in vitro.
<br>
5. Proanthocyanidins inhibit the enzymes which lead to histamine
<br>
formation.
<br>
6. They help increase the effectiveness of Vitamin C by acting as a
<br>
carrier and as a restorer of oxidized Vitamin C by working with
<br>
glutathione.

<p>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE
<br>
Very berry - and grape too!
<br>
<p>Plants usually contain complex mixtures of phenolic compounds, including
<br>
simple phenolic acids, quercetin, catechins, epicatechins,
<br>
proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins. Wine is estimated to contain over two
<br>
hundred phenolic compounds, though it is known that proanthocyanidins are
<br>
the major bioactive polyphenols.  The range of health benefits of
<br>
polyphenols is extremely wide. Known primarily as potent antioxidants,
<br>
they have also been reported to show antibacterial and antiviral action,
<br>
to be anticarcinogenic, antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory and
<br>
anti-allergic. Various polyphenols have been shown to inhibit platelet
<br>
aggregation and lipid peroxidation, as well as promote vasodilation and
<br>
improve microcirculation. They can also chelate metals. Other benefits of
<br>
high intake of polyphenols may include fewer cavities (an anti-caries
<br>
action), improved kidney function, younger- looking skin and even the
<br>
promotion of hair growth.
<br>
<p>Besides the need to minimize the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, one needs
<br>
to consider the role of platelet aggregation in arterial disease. Platelet
<br>
aggregation is the first step in the formation of clots, which may lead to
<br>
heart attack or stroke. Part of the effectiveness of aspirin in preventing
<br>
heart attacks lies in its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation and thus
<br>
the formation of clots. Dr. Lester Packer demonstrated that Pycnogenol, an
<br>
extract from pine bark that is similar in composition to grape seed
<br>
extract, &quot;works better than aspirin in terms of controlling platelet
<br>
aggregation, but without the unwanted side effects associated with
<br>
aspirin. Pycnogenol reduced human smoking-induced platelet aggregation to
<br>
the same extent as a five-time-higher dose of aspirin&quot; (p. 127). This is a
<br>
very dramatic finding, suggesting that cardiac patients especially should
<br>
consider taking Pycnogenol or grape seed extract for preventive purposes.
<br>
<p>Epidemiological studies confirm that those who consume plenty of
<br>
polyphenol-rich foods and beverages have a lower risk of cancer. We are
<br>
always being urged to eat more fruits and vegetables. There has been
<br>
little guidance, however, as to which fruits and vegetables should be
<br>
particularly emphasized. There is reason to think that berries should be
<br>
very high on the list.
