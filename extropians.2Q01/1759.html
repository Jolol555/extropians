<em>&gt; I have a hard time with this stuff no matter what the time of day--and

about
<br>
<em>&gt; half my thesis is on this, i.e., on the philosophical foundations of
</em><br>
logic.
<br>
<em>&gt; To my mind, the question is not whether we can understand violations of
</em><br>
our
<br>
<em>&gt; most cherished logical laws, but whether we could verify this is the case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is an analogy: A child of 4 is told by her loving physicist mother
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; E=Mcc. The child has good evidence that this is true--mum wouldn't lie
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; this--but she cannot comprehend the meaning of this statement. Does the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child know that E=Mcc even though she cannot understand what the statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means?
</em><br>
<p>To begin with, I have a feeling that this is a flawed analogy...
<br>
<p>That E=mc^2 in this kind of universe is again something that even the II can
<br>
manipulate at will. What I'm against in the scenario is that the III would
<br>
be able to say that
<br>
'Given that p and not-p implies falsum for all p, me and not-me implies
<br>
not-falsum'.
<br>
<p>A threefoil knot is not isomorphic to the ring in 3-space. When embedded in
<br>
4 or higher spaces, it is trivially isomorphic. This follows from axioms in
<br>
set theory, in topology and in knot theory -- and again my problem with the
<br>
III God is that he is supposed to be able to break against axiomatic laws
<br>
without stepping out of that axiomatic system.
<br>
<p>If we 'solve' the threefoil by embedding it in 4-space, we step out of the
<br>
original system. In 3-space, the problem of finding such an isomorphy is ex
<br>
definitio unsolvable.
<br>
<p>'Violations of our most cherished logical laws' cannot be understood within
<br>
their axiomatic system -- but these violations form _ANOTHER_ axiomatic
<br>
system, with its own validity, its own pecularities and its own results. The
<br>
study of it will with any luck even be rather interesting; but it doesn't
<br>
have any impact whatsoever on the axiomatic systems already in study, since
<br>
they build on different axioms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you answer yes, the question then is could we be in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relation to a God III. A rationalistic response is to say no, because we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot verify statements that we cannot understand. Fideism allows the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility that we are in exactly the same position as the child, that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could trust a God III who said: &quot;hey you humans, your logic is wrong, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then again, that is understandable, you were built that way. The fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you cannot understand this is no more telling than the fact that a child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't understand relativity theory.&quot; To the rationalist, the fideist looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational placing so much evidence on interpersonal trust. To the
</em><br>
fideist,
<br>
<em>&gt; the rationalist looks inconsistent because asserting the supremacy of
</em><br>
human
<br>
<em>&gt; reason can itself only be a matter of trust. Could we build a God III that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we could not understand but who we could trust? I leave that as a homework
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assignment. Mark and Not-Mark.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't place myself in any of these slots. It would be one thing if he
<br>
came down unto us and spake of our misunderstanding -- i.e. &quot;Hey, you
<br>
humans! Your logic is _incompatible_with_the_universe_ you live in, but then
<br>
again, that is understandable, you were built that way...&quot;; that's a
<br>
statement of the relationship between the mathematics and the real world,
<br>
but it still wouldn't influence the validity of the pure mathematics -- our
<br>
axiomatic systems still would be valid, they just wouldn't say anything
<br>
useful about the world around us.
<br>
<p>Axiom 1)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Implication follows the laws we're used to.
<br>
Axiom 2)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;p ^ -p --/-&gt; F
<br>
Axiom 3)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark is a possible p
