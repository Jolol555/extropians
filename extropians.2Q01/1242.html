<p>Tough, I'm sure they're there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And that's the impression that's going to go over to the teeming billions,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeper. Science and technology *are* seen as magic by many people, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today.
</em><br>
<p>And why shouldn't they be?
<br>
<p>We've doubled (or more) life expectancy, Saved the Children (cut child
<br>
mortality to near zero -- related facts, actually), banished food worries for
<br>
most of society, and maybe for all of society in the more developed welfare
<br>
states of Europe (that pesky distribution problem), reduced necessary physical
<br>
labor to almost unhealthy levels... obviously I'm talking mostly about the
<br>
First World.  Which is a lot more peaceful, in terms of both war and crime,
<br>
than the historical standard.  Or if there's more crime, it's less than you'd
<br>
expect for cities of our size and density.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;                    .... Scarcity has never been the problem. Just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opposite; overpopulation creates social problems. Politics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; distribution failures produce scarcity, but that has to do with misuse of
</em><br>
<p>Garbage.  We have 6 billion people.  By your logic, scarcity (resources
<br>
divided by population, after all) should be much worse than when we had 100
<br>
million people.  Yet it isn't, because of our technology.
<br>
<p>And societies have collapsed due to scarcity caused by environmental change;
<br>
Jared Diamond's next book will be about just that, I think.
<br>
<p>Iraq attacked Kuwait, and we defended Kuwait, because of the scarcity of oil.
<br>
No civilization attacked the steppes of Asia the way the nomads of those
<br>
steppes attacked civilization, because who the hell would want the steppes of
<br>
Asia?  The closest the West has come to blows in recent years -- tiffs between
<br>
Canada and Spain, and Canada and Alaska or Seattle people -- have been about
<br>
ocean fishing rights, i.e. the scarcity of fish.
<br>
<p>Not all conflict comes from economic scarcity; I don't know that it'd explain
<br>
the Roman Empire, let alone the Arab one.  But fights over land and water and
<br>
oil and gold have hardly been negligible.
