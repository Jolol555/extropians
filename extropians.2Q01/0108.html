<p>
I read the news of the Bush budget axe falling so heavily on NASA with a 
<br>
feeling of sadness, but also of resignation.  The simple fact is that the 
<br>
national space programs of the Cold War period simply can't persist in the 
<br>
contemporary world, and that broad social support for &quot;pure&quot; space science 
<br>
isn't strong enough to sustain a large space exploration effort.  Even the 
<br>
emotional support for the sheer adventure of manned space activities has 
<br>
largely evaporated outside of the &quot;space enthusiast&quot; community.  As Michael 
<br>
Butler pointed out, attempts to make a go of access to space outside of the 
<br>
traditional national space programs that seemed to have so much promise just 
<br>
a few years ago have all proved quixotic in the extreme.
<br>
<p>I've come to the conclusion that the sooner the different elements of the 
<br>
space exploration and development community come to the realization that the 
<br>
&quot;old game&quot; is over, the better.  A LOT of energy has been wasted on trying to 
<br>
salvage elements of the Cold War space programs and develop incremental 
<br>
evolutionary pathways that build on what is left of them.  In this regard, I 
<br>
feel that ideas like Robert Zubrin's are exactly the wrong kind of program to 
<br>
be proposing at this time.  Trying to hitch one's wagon to the current 
<br>
machinery of space access and infrastructure -- such as it is -- is a 
<br>
prescription for wasted time, effort and money, because any such plans will 
<br>
inevitably be built on the requirement of continuing political support for 
<br>
NASA.  NASA's mandate is, in my opinion, irretrievably confused by the 
<br>
political process, having been since the end of the Cold War a hodge-podge 
<br>
rationalization based on whatever opportunity of the moment its 
<br>
administrators can conjure out of the political swamp in Washington.
<br>
<p>Rather than wasting energy by trying to revive the now decaying remains of 
<br>
the original national space programs, I feel a much more fruitful approach 
<br>
would be to begin work on designing and planning for a program of space 
<br>
exploration and development premised on technologies we ought to have 
<br>
available for that enterprise within the next ten years.  There are certainly 
<br>
seeds of such an approach scattered throughout the space science and 
<br>
technology communities. People working on micro-sats and fleet architectures 
<br>
for them are definitely on the right track.  The approach being taken for 
<br>
their solar sail platform by the Planetary Society is also very promising.    
<br>
What's missing is a unifying vision for creating a space infrastructure that 
<br>
isn't so completely dependent on NASA and doesn't require the unreliable 
<br>
support of a political world that has no appreciation for the enterprise of 
<br>
moving beyond this one planet.  In this regard, designing and building some 
<br>
basic building blocks for creating space infrastructure out of very small and 
<br>
light elements should be a high priority, as well as developing reliable and 
<br>
robust self-assembling systems.
