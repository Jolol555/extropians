<p>
The lesson from the past decade in cryonics appears rather dismal. Not
<br>
only is the product intrinsically difficult to sell, it is technically
<br>
demanding, and under current framing conditions difficult to deploy in the
<br>
field, especially rapidly (when little forewarning if any is given) and
<br>
with adequate geographic coverage.  Quality control and documentation is
<br>
either absent or patchy at best. As a result, consistency in application
<br>
of even existing well developed protocols vary widely. Self-selecting
<br>
personal dynamics result in general unreasonability if in not in flakiness
<br>
of all aspects of behaviour of all parties involved, business practices
<br>
included. I do not exclude myself from this assessment. Advanced methods
<br>
do exist, yet there is no significant demand from the parts of the
<br>
customers to lobby for a better product. This pattern is easily visible
<br>
and extremely off-putting to any potentially interested establishment
<br>
professional practicioners, who immediately back off and do not come back
<br>
to reinvestigate the field, which stagnates as a result. Peer review is
<br>
absent. As a result, criminally negligent service providers continue to
<br>
exist (this means you, Robert Ettinger/CI) and to operate, severely
<br>
damaging and potentially killing patients in their care.
<br>
<p>Reluctantly, I've decided to take the (personal, your mileage *will* vary)
<br>
consequences and for time being am going to stop participation in all
<br>
cryonics-related activities, whether at the service or the client side.
<br>
I'm betting on the mainstream medicine on the long run to eventually
<br>
realize the feasibility of reversible cryosuspension using the emerging
<br>
techniques of bulk molecular-scale imaging and reconstruction, and to make
<br>
it an integral part of last-resort emergency care, profiting from
<br>
economies of scale, infrastructure and synergisms. Given current and
<br>
accelerating rate of progress in a number of relevant fields as well as
<br>
changing world demographics, this does not appear at all unlikely, 30-40
<br>
decades of such ongoing developments assuming. If this does not occur, or
<br>
I happen to die before, so be it.
<br>
<p>I think I still owe any potential customers and current customers of CI a
<br>
fully listed disclosure of what is technically wrong with CI, and why I
<br>
consider it to be improbable, that CI -- miracles excluded -- will ever
<br>
fix it. Not that this is going to matter very much, but I'll put my name
<br>
under it, and the archives will get it. Running into this information may
<br>
prevent the one or the other signup. Having this said, I strongly
<br>
discourage litigation against CI, since if successful, it will endanger
<br>
the patients under their care, which might or might not be still
<br>
salvageable.
<br>
<p>In closing, I would very much like to express my admiration to all the
<br>
technical people out there in the field who're pulling in their full
<br>
weight, against above odds. You know who you are. Especial thanks go to
<br>
Saul Kent and Bill Faloon, may their commitment continue unwavering.
<br>
<p>I'll hang around for a few days here before firing off the CI assessment
<br>
piece (mostly assembled from freely available information, Cryonet
<br>
archives included), to catch your comments, if any.
<br>
<p>Apart from that dangling end, I'm almost out of here. I hope you all make
<br>
it.
<br>

Subject: UK situation
<br>
<p>While not wanting to hammer this topic till it becomes as boring as, say,
<br>
the discussions of human vs. machine intelligence, or identity, I did find
<br>
the following material interesting. It's a copy of some email that was
<br>
sent and signed by about a dozen British people, to Alcor, a couple of
<br>
months ago. I think it sheds light on the situation. So far as I know, the
<br>
request in the letter was denied.
<br>
<p>--Charles Platt
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<p>We the undersigned UK residents have experienced delays &amp; difficulties
<br>
with Alcor Membership. Some of us have been waiting since 1999 for Alcor
<br>
to complete our paperwork.
<br>
<p>We have all been encouraged to join Alcor. For example in a document
<br>
entitled &quot;Towards Autonomy-a Proposal for Alcor UK- dated 16th. August
<br>
2000, Linda Chamberlain states:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. First Stage of Conversion-Split Program Years 2000-2002. In this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;period you should pursue greater membership as rapidly as possible.
<br>
<p>Acting on this advice &amp; in good faith many of us have spent thousands of
<br>
pounds taking out UK Life Insurance Policies, putting them in Trust,
<br>
paying Solicitors, Public Notaries &amp; others.
<br>
<p>In a letter dated February 12th. 2001 Linda says &quot; I'm afraid we will have
<br>
to make the international membership requirements apply to the UK as
<br>
well (no longer being able to offer Scottish Amicable as an exception with
<br>
the UK)&quot;
<br>
<p>However some of us have taken out Life Insurance before applying for
<br>
Membership(as Alcor advises) If we cancel or even just re-assign these
<br>
Policies we would face considerable financial losses through no fault of
<br>
our own.
<br>
<p>We therefore request that Alcor accepts all such Policies arranged before
<br>
the Feb.12th. announcement &amp; allows us to proceed with our Membership.
<br>
<p>Signed: [names withheld]
