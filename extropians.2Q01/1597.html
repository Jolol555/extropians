<p><em>&gt; &lt; snall throat clearing sounds &gt; Jerry Fodor has been pushing this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea since 1966 or so... :)
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool!  I've got this idea written up in my paper, but if
<br>
someone can give me a real reference, I can give proper credit where
<br>
it is due.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then Dennett's claim: we don't have qualia &quot;It just seems
<br>
that we do&quot; wasn't published in his book until 1992 right?  Who had
<br>
this idea before him so that Fodor could make this criticism?  I'm
<br>
sure not very good at history.  It's to bad such good ideas are so
<br>
easily lost or ignored by people such as Dennett...?  I continually
<br>
find that most of the Ideas I've had about consciousness many
<br>
philosophers have had very close ideas to such as far back as
<br>
Descartes and earlier.  I just can't understand why so many people so
<br>
easily dismiss, ignore, and more or less loose such great information
<br>
and more of it isn't maintained in the popular press and writings on
<br>
this topic.  How can it be that all forms of &quot;representationalism&quot;,
<br>
and it's implications, and ease of explaining/predicting so many
<br>
things, are so completely ignored today?  It just blows my mind.
<br>
