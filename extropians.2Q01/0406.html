Hi &quot;Zero Powers&quot;,
<br>
<p>This was also done last year as well.  I do not know which university you
<br>
are referring too but I believe that some researchers in the US did the
<br>
following:
<br>
<p>First they immobilized the cats in an apparatus that fixed their gaze at a
<br>
very large wall projector.  They removed the cerebral cortex of anesthetized
<br>
cats in order to expose the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.  The
<br>
LGN of the thalamus is a quick stop over location between the retina and the
<br>
visual cortex - a low-level visual processing area if you will.  They then
<br>
presenting calibration stimulus to the cat while recording the neural
<br>
activity in the LCN.  From this procedure they were able to determine the
<br>
visual information conveyed by the LGN neural firing.  It is important to
<br>
note that the calibration was basically determining the type of
<br>
center-surround class (on-off or off-on) and the involved colors (&lt;-- I'm
<br>
not sure about this) as well as the respective receptive field (ie. size,
<br>
orientation).  It is the ganglion cells in the retina that give rise to the
<br>
axons that innervate the LGN.  I believe they used ellipsoids to represent
<br>
the receptive fields.  After this calibration they were able to reconstruct
<br>
arbitrary visual stimulus from just the neural firing - thus you have
<br>
created a cat-mediated video camera.
<br>
<p>In this old presentation of mine I have some reconstructions of scenes of
<br>
the original cat-video camera:

Subject: TECH: Cat eye video camera???
<br>
<p>I heard a short piece on the radio today about some researchers (in the
<br>
U.K.?) who had successfully attached wires to a cat's brain and by recording
<br>
the signals in its brain had recreated discernable images of what the cat
<br>
sees on video.  I can't find anything about it on the net.  Anybody here
<br>
know anything about this?
<br>
<p>Thanks.
