<p>Well, we clearly need to do so from an encryption standpoint as well.

Don't want any aliens finding their way around the solar system too
<br>
easily, they might land a cruise photon torpedo on us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can easily figure out their position at all times and run their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; navigation routines off that data rather than having to deal with star

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know, wouldn't a few low-res solid state cameras would give you

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is probably not all that much requirements for a solar positioning

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cover the terrain, unless you stud the space evenly with nodes each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; covering a space of a lightsecond, or so.
</em><br>
<p>I'm primarily interested in simplicity, so cameras and so forth are too
<br>
much. Each face of the cubic bus will have a photosensor head for rough
<br>
intensity sensing to determine the direction of the sun. Everything else
<br>
will come from SPS transmissions of Satellite transmitter ID, timestamp,
<br>
and its own known position. Beyond the three E-S lagrange sites, an SPS
<br>
transmitter should be put in orbit around each planet as a planetary
<br>
transponder.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What probes really need are built-in survival reflexes. A little orrery in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; which knows &quot;it is probably not a good idea to fly into solid objects at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mach 19&quot;, &quot;account for estimated future burns in respect to fuel use&quot;,

<p>A very good point. Tell it to go point A to point B and let it figure
<br>
out how to get there.

<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what? Why are we still using ancient navigation techniques? There should

<p>Sure, but smoke signals are old hat too.

<em>&gt; &gt; This would be a good investment of public money, and its even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; constitutional for libertarians: space is a 'channel of commerce', or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'navigable waterway', so the gummint is responsible for maintaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their navigability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am currently designing a 180x200x200 millimeter probe bus that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; use GaAs/GaAnt solar cells fed focused sunlight from 2 inflated 2 meter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dia. mirrors (theoretical output: 2.99 kW) to power the electric

<em>&gt; &gt; thruster of choice. Fuel tank is 150mm dia spherical. Pick your own wall

</em><br>

<em>&gt; Maybe you can help me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When thinking about a cloud of coke-can sized satellites for digital pulse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radio and wireless networking (no stabilization, realtime beamforming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using active antennas), one has the following problems: the systems need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be gossamer, yet able to survival rough (shrapnel-size) deployments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Initially I thought about using vanilla rectangular monocrystalline Si
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells on springed hinges (jack-in-the-box type panel unfolding). However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these things are rather brittle. So I thought freezing the sat into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sublimating solid cube (water, or dry ice), which will vanish within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few hours under orbital conditions. However, this will eliminate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantages due to higher weight. I then thought of a photolythic foam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; envelope, then of a pyrotechnical envelope (shrapnel deployment scenari),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which doubles as protection and propulsion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any ideas in that area?
</em><br>
<p>Aerogel. How cold can they get? I'd say frozen hydrogen, but thats
<br>
conductive as well as corrosive.
<br>
I think that ice is the lightest you could possibly get unless you use
<br>
some foam concept.
<br>
<p>I have a similar problem with an idea I have to suspend hydrogen and
<br>
oxygen in a solid matrix, to create a hydrogen oxygen rocket that uses a
<br>
solid fuel rocket's simplicity of design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thickness, pressure, contents. Maneuvering thrusters will be solid state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pulse ignition chemical micro-thrusters off-the-shelf. Navigation will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; depend on SSPS to be in place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You decide what payload you want and how quickly you want it wherever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you are going. I figure with this size bus you could deliver a laptop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sized replicator facility to any NEA within a few months of launch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Officer, arrest that man. He's obviously dangerous.
