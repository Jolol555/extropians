<p>
So, any suggestions for an improvement in the system?
<br>
<p>I think one constraint in the current system is that reviewing is unpaid 
<br>
work, where you at most get some credit if you are known to belong to the 
<br>
reviewers of a well respected journal. Right now the journal system is in the 
<br>
process of change as net publications are emerging and challenging the 
<br>
traditional paper journals, so presumably this might be the time to look for 
<br>
new &quot;business models&quot; for peer review too.
<br>
<p>I am fond of the idea of review boards, groups or reviewers placing their 
<br>
seals of approval (or denial, for that matter) on papers without being tied 
<br>
to journals. Instead journals publish papers that have been approved by 
<br>
respected review boards, and the review information might also be available 
<br>
over the net. What remains to be figured out is how to make this profitable 
<br>
for the reviewers (so they want to do it) without introducing risks of 
<br>
biasing them through payment.
