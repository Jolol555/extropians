<p>Matt, insofar as I do not have a complete Flare document at this time, I
<br>
can only convey information about Flare insofar as you are willing to
<br>
assume that whatever small statements I have time to make are not stupid. 
<br>
I know what a macro preprocessor is.

</em><br>
<p>I am quite happy to answer questions about &quot;Friendly AI&quot;, a vision which
<br>
has now been written up.  I will be quite happy to answer questions about
<br>
Flare when Flare has been written up.  *You* raised the subject of Flare
<br>
again.  Not me.  I was talking about Friendly AI, which has now been
<br>
written up, when you switched the subject to Flare.  Do you see what I
<br>
mean here?  Writing up a vision takes time.  So can we please stop
<br>
discussing the inadequate documentation of visions whose writeups are
<br>
still on the &quot;To Do&quot; list and discuss one of the visions I've had time to
<br>
document?  Say, causal goal systems with Bayesian reinforcement subsuming
<br>
some of the functionality of pain and pleasure, or feature extraction for
<br>
linear and temporal sensory modalities?
<br>
<p>Considering that I was right in the middle of announcing Friendly AI when
<br>
this happened, do I have any reason to believe that you won't switch from
<br>
complaining about Flare to complaining about the documentation of the
<br>
codic sensory modality if I *did* drop everything and work on Flare?  The
<br>
fact is that I'm on a big task, and the pieces of the overall structure
<br>
I've described are being documented one by one.  There will always be
<br>
plenty of stuff I haven't gotten to yet.  If you want to discuss details,
<br>
I suggest you focus on what *has* been documented, instead of demanding
<br>
that I change my schedule.
