<p><p>Not only can you replace sendmail (which I also loathe) with qmail, but it
<br>
is highly recommended.  Many of the largest mail servers on the 'net use
<br>
qmail; you don't really lose any functionality with it that I can tell and
<br>
it is definitely robust.  I am almost positive that the standard spam
<br>
functionality is included in qmail, since it is the &quot;other&quot; big backbone
<br>
mail relay.  In my experience, qmail is slowly but surely encroaching on
<br>
the mindshare space that used to belong to sendmail and for good reason; I
<br>
know companies that have migrated from sendmail to qmail but never the
<br>
other way around.
<br>
<p>Another happy qmail convert,
