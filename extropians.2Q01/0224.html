<p>Napster clone may set up shop offshore
<br>
<p>By STEVEN CHASE
<br>
<em>&gt;From Monday's Globe and Mail
</em><br>
<p><p>Vancouver - A 21-year-old Canadian Web entrepreneur is planning to
<br>
circumvent the imminent demise of Napster Inc.'s controversial Internet
<br>
song-trading system by setting up a clone of the service on a so-called
<br>
&quot;data haven&quot; platform off the coast of Britain.
<br>
<p>&quot;I am sad to see Napster bending to the record labels' will,&quot; said Matt
<br>
Goyer, a computer science student at the University of Waterloo in
<br>
Waterloo, Ont. &quot;Let's preserve it and we'll move it offshore where the
<br>
record industry can't touch it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Napster is a wildly popular software program that allows Internet users
<br>
to
<br>
swap free music between computers over the Web, much to the chagrin of
<br>
the
<br>
recording industry. In about two years, Napster has amassed 64 million
<br>
users from around the world who are drawn by the allure of free,
<br>
near-CD-quality music that can be played on digital audio players or on
<br>
computers.
<br>
<p>A series of court victories for record labels has all but doomed
<br>
Napster.
<br>
On Friday, Napster announced it would take steps during the weekend to
<br>
block file-sharing of copyrighted music on its service, in an effort to
<br>
prevent a U.S. federal judge from shutting it down completely. It said
<br>
it
<br>
had identified one million unauthorized song files it will block.
<br>
<p>However, no apparent antipiracy filter was in effect as of early Sunday
<br>
night. Napster officials offered no explanation, leading company
<br>
watchers
<br>
to speculate it may have been having trouble setting up the blocking
<br>
technology. Napster itself has warned users that blocking the files will
<br>
be
<br>
a difficult task. &quot;It is a complex technological solution that is very
<br>
taxing to the system and will degrade the operation of the service,&quot; the
<br>
company says on its Web site.
<br>
<p>Many of Napster's users were still freely trading music files via the
<br>
service with no interference. For instance, on just one of Napster's
<br>
dozens
<br>
of computer servers, about 11,000 users were swapping about two million
<br>
files.
<br>
<p>Waterloo's Mr. Goyer is eyeing HavenCo Ltd. as a possible site for his
<br>
cloned Napster computer server. The company rents computing power and
<br>
Internet data storage space to those seeking to avoid government laws.
<br>
It
<br>
operates from an ocean platform called Sealand, which has operated for
<br>
30
<br>
years as a sovereign territory off the coast of England.
<br>
<p>He hopes to collect an estimated $15,000 (U.S.) yearly HavenCo rental
<br>
fee
<br>
from music fans. If that doesn't work out, he plans to sign up with
<br>
other
<br>
renegade services. &quot;There's enough irate people out there I think I can
<br>
get
<br>
many to chip in $10 each,&quot; Mr. Goyer said.
<br>
<p>Others have already set up Napster clone servers - computers that help
<br>
hook
<br>
up music lovers to swap songs using Napster-like software - in North
<br>
America. But these are under attack from record labels that are forcing
<br>
Internet service providers to stop offering Web access to these Napster
<br>
clones.
<br>
<p>Mr. Goyer is no newcomer to the Napster debate. Last year, he and
<br>
partner
<br>
John Cormie set up Fairtunes.com, a virtual &quot;tip jar&quot; where Internet
<br>
users
<br>
swapping free music on Napster could soothe their conscience by sending
<br>
cash to artists. Fairtunes has collected about $7,000 for artists and
<br>
Mr.
<br>
Goyer hopes to use the site to collect donations for the Napster clone
<br>
service.
<br>
<p>But Mr. Goyer is only one of many Napster devotees flouting the
<br>
recording
<br>
industry's attempt to shut down the service. Some fans began migrating
<br>
on
<br>
the weekend to lesser-known and less user-friendly file-swapping
<br>
alternatives such as Gnutella. Others began renaming song files in an
<br>
effort to stymie the imminent copyright filter on Napster that is
<br>
expected
<br>
to ban music by album and title names.
<br>
<p>Saturday and Sunday were marathon downloading sessions for millions of
<br>
Napster users, including Vancouverite Bradley Kalmek, 28, who spent so
<br>
much
<br>
time staring at a computer screen that his eyes were strained.
<br>
<p>&quot;Might as well make hay while the sun shines. It was a bit too good to
<br>
last
<br>
forever. So, I'm taking advantage now,&quot; he said.
<br>
