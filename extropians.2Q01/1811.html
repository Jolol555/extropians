<br>
<p><em>&gt;From New Scientist magazine, 10 March 2001.
</em><br>
<p>The Omega Man
<br>
<p>He shattered mathematics with a single number. And that was just for
<br>
starters, says Marcus Chown
<br>
<p>TWO plus two equals four: nobody would argue with that. Mathematicians
<br>
can rigorously prove sums like this, and many other things besides. The
<br>
language of maths allows them to provide neatly ordered ways to describe
<br>
everything that happens in the world around us.
<br>
<p>Or so they once thought. Gregory Chaitin, a mathematics researcher at
<br>
IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, has
<br>
shown that mathematicians can't actually prove very much at all. Doing
<br>
maths, he says, is just a process of discovery like every other branch
<br>
of science: it's an experimental field where mathematicians stumble upon
<br>
facts in the same way that zoologists might come across a new species of
<br>
primate.
<br>
<p>Mathematics has always been considered free of uncertainty and able to
<br>
provide a pure foundation for other, messier fields of science. But
<br>
maths is just as messy, Chaitin says: mathematicians are simply acting
<br>
on intuition and experimenting with ideas, just like everyone else.
<br>
Zoologists think there might be something new swinging from branch to
<br>
branch in the unexplored forests of Madagascar, and mathematicians have
<br>
hunches about which part of the mathematical landscape to explore. The
<br>
subject is no more profound than that.
<br>
<p>The reason for Chaitin's provocative statements is that he has found
<br>
that the core of mathematics is riddled with holes. Chaitin has shown
<br>
that there are an infinite number of mathematical facts but, for the
<br>
most part, they are unrelated to each other and impossible to tie
<br>
together with unifying theorems. If mathematicians find any connections
<br>
between these facts, they do so by luck. &quot;Most of mathematics is true
<br>
for no particular reason,&quot; Chaitin says. &quot;Maths is true by accident.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is particularly bad news for physicists on a quest for a complete
<br>
and concise description of the Universe. Maths is the language of
<br>
physics, so Chaitin's discovery implies there can never be a reliable
<br>
&quot;theory of everything&quot;, neatly summarising all the basic features of
<br>
reality in one set of equations. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but even
<br>
Steven Weinberg, a Nobel prizewinning physicist and author of Dreams of
<br>
a Final Theory, has swallowed it. &quot;We will never be sure that our final
<br>
theory is mathematically consistent,&quot; he admits.
<br>
<p>Chaitin's mathematical curse is not an abstract theorem or an
<br>
impenetrable equation: it is simply a number. This number, which Chaitin
<br>
calls Omega, is real, just as pi is real. But Omega is infinitely long
<br>
and utterly incalculable. Chaitin has found that Omega infects the whole
<br>
of mathematics, placing fundamental limits on what we can know. And
<br>
Omega is just the beginning. There are even more disturbing
<br>
numbers--Chaitin calls them Super-Omegas--that would defy calculation
<br>
even if we ever managed to work Omega out. The Omega strain of
<br>
incalculable numbers reveals that mathematics is not simply moth-eaten,
<br>
it is mostly made of gaping holes. Anarchy, not order, is at the heart
<br>
of the Universe.
<br>
<p>Chaitin discovered Omega and its astonishing properties while wrestling
<br>
with two of the most influential mathematical discoveries of the 20th
<br>
century. In 1931, the Austrian mathematician Kurt Gödel blew a gaping
<br>
hole in mathematics: his Incompleteness Theorem showed there are some
<br>
mathematical theorems that you just can't prove. Then, five years later,
<br>
British mathematician Alan Turing built on Gödel's work.
<br>
<p>Using a hypothetical computer that could mimic the operation of any
<br>
machine, Turing showed that there is something that can never be
<br>
computed. There are no instructions you can give a computer that will
<br>
enable it to decide in advance whether a given program will ever finish
<br>
its task and halt. To find out whether a program will eventually
<br>
halt--after a day, a week or a trillion years--you just have to run it
<br>
and wait. He called this the halting problem.
<br>
<p>Decades later, in the 1960s, Chaitin took up where Turing left off.
<br>
Fascinated by Turing's work, he began to investigate the halting
<br>
problem. He considered all the possible programs that Turing's
<br>
hypothetical computer could run, and then looked for the probability
<br>
that a program, chosen at random from among all the possible programs,
<br>
will halt. The work took him nearly 20 years, but he eventually showed
<br>
that this &quot;halting probability&quot; turns Turing's question of whether a
<br>
program halts into a real number, somewhere between 0 and 1.
<br>
<p>Chaitin named this number Omega. And he showed that, just as there are
<br>
no computable instructions for determining in advance whether a computer
<br>
will halt, there are also no instructions for determining the digits of
<br>
Omega. Omega is uncomputable.
<br>
<p>Some numbers, like pi, can be generated by a relatively short program
<br>
which calculates its infinite number of digits one by one--how far you
<br>
go is just a matter of time and resources. Another example of a
<br>
computable number might be one that comprises 200 repeats of the
<br>
sequence 0101. The number is long, but a program for generating it only
<br>
need say: &quot;repeat '01' 400 times&quot;.
<br>
<p>There is no such program for Omega: in binary, it consists of an
<br>
unending, random string of 0s and 1s. &quot;My Omega number has no pattern or
<br>
structure to it whatsoever,&quot; says Chaitin. &quot;It's a string of 0s and 1s
<br>
in which each digit is as unrelated to its predecessor as one coin toss
<br>
is from the next.&quot;
<br>
<p>The same process that led Turing to conclude that the halting problem is
<br>
undecidable also led Chaitin to the discovery of an unknowable number.
<br>
&quot;It's the outstanding example of something which is unknowable in
<br>
mathematics,&quot; Chaitin says.
<br>
<p>An unknowable number wouldn't be a problem if it never reared its head.
<br>
But once Chaitin had discovered Omega, he began to wonder whether it
<br>
might have implications in the real world. So he decided to search
<br>
mathematics for places where Omega might crop up. So far, he has only
<br>
looked properly in one place: number theory.
<br>
<p>Number theory is the foundation of pure mathematics. It describes how to
<br>
deal with concepts such as counting, adding, and multiplying. Chaitin's
<br>
search for Omega in number theory started with &quot;Diophantine
<br>
equations&quot;--which involve only the simple concepts of addition,
<br>
multiplication and exponentiation (raising one number to the power of
<br>
another) of whole numbers.
<br>
<p>Chaitin formulated a Diophantine equation that was 200 pages long and
<br>
had 17,000 variables. Given an equation like this, mathematicians would
<br>
normally search for its solutions. There could be any number of answers:
<br>
perhaps 10, 20, or even an infinite number of them. But Chaitin didn't
<br>
look for specific solutions, he simply looked to see whether there was a
<br>
finite or an infinite number of them.
<br>
<p>He did this because he knew it was the key to unearthing Omega.
<br>
Mathematicians James Jones of the University of Calgary and Yuri
<br>
Matijasevic of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in St Petersburg had
<br>
shown how to translate the operation of Turing's computer into a
<br>
Diophantine equation. They found that there is a relationship between
<br>
the solutions to the equation and the halting problem for the machine's
<br>
program. Specifically, if a particular program doesn't ever halt, a
<br>
particular Diophantine equation will have no solution. In effect, the
<br>
equations provide a bridge linking Turing's halting problem--and thus
<br>
Chaitin's halting probability--with simple mathematical operations, such
<br>
as the addition and multiplication of whole numbers.
<br>
<p>Chaitin had arranged his equation so that there was one particular
<br>
variable, a parameter which he called N, that provided the key to
<br>
finding Omega. When he substituted numbers for N, analysis of the
<br>
equation would provide the digits of Omega in binary. When he put 1 in
<br>
place of N, he would ask whether there was a finite or infinite number
<br>
of whole number solutions to the resulting equation. The answer gives
<br>
the first digit of Omega: a finite number of solutions would make this
<br>
digit 0, an infinite number of solutions would make it 1. Substituting 2
<br>
for N and asking the same question about the equation's solutions would
<br>
give the second digit of Omega. Chaitin could, in theory, continue
<br>
forever. &quot;My equation is constructed so that asking
<br>
whether it has finitely or infinitely many solutions as you vary the
<br>
parameter is the same as determining the bits of Omega,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>But Chaitin already knew that each digit of Omega is random and
<br>
independent. This could only mean one thing. Because finding out whether
<br>
a Diophantine equation has a finite or infinite number of solutions
<br>
generates these digits, each answer to the equation must therefore be
<br>
unknowable and independent of every other answer. In other words, the
<br>
randomness of the digits of Omega imposes limits on what can be known
<br>
from number theory--the most elementary of mathematical fields. &quot;If
<br>
randomness is even in something as basic as number theory, where else is
<br>
it?&quot; asks Chaitin. He thinks he knows the answer. &quot;My hunch is it's
<br>
everywhere,&quot; he says. &quot;Randomness is the true foundation of
<br>
mathematics.&quot;
<br>
<p>The fact that randomness is everywhere has deep consequences, says John
<br>
Casti, a mathematician at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico and the
<br>
Vienna University of Technology. It means that a few bits of maths may
<br>
follow from each other, but for most mathematical situations those
<br>
connections won't exist. And if you can't make connections, you can't
<br>
solve or prove things. All a mathematician can do is aim to find the
<br>
little bits of maths that do tie together. &quot;Chaitin's work shows that
<br>
solvable problems are like a small island in a vast sea of undecidable
<br>
propositions,&quot; Casti says.
<br>
<p>Take the problem of perfect odd numbers. A perfect number has divisors
<br>
whose sum makes the number. For example, 6 is perfect because its
<br>
divisors are 1, 2 and 3, and their sum is 6. There are plenty of even
<br>
perfect numbers, but no one has ever found an odd number that is
<br>
perfect. And yet, no one has been able to prove that an odd number can't
<br>
be perfect. Unproved hypotheses like this and the Riemann hypothesis,
<br>
which has become the unsure foundation of many other theorems (New
<br>
Scientist, 11 November 2000, p 32) are examples
<br>
of things that should be accepted as unprovable but nonetheless true,
<br>
Chaitin suggests. In other words, there are some things that scientists
<br>
will always have to take on trust.
<br>
<p>Unsurprisingly, mathematicians had a difficult time coming to terms with
<br>
Omega. But there is worse to come. &quot;We can go beyond Omega,&quot; Chaitin
<br>
says. In his new book, Exploring Randomness (New Scientist, 10 January,
<br>
p 46), Chaitin has now unleashed the &quot;Super-Omegas&quot;.
<br>
<p>Like Omega, the Super-Omegas also owe their genesis to Turing. He
<br>
imagined a God-like computer, much more powerful than any real computer,
<br>
which could know the unknowable: whether a real computer would halt when
<br>
running a particular program, or carry on forever. He called this
<br>
fantastical machine an &quot;oracle&quot;. And as soon as Chaitin discovered
<br>
Omega--the probability that a random computer program would eventually
<br>
halt--he realised he could also imagine an oracle that would know Omega.
<br>
This machine would have its own unknowable halting probability, Omega'.
<br>
<p>But if one oracle knows Omega, it's easy to imagine a second-order
<br>
oracle that knows Omega'. This machine, in turn, has its own halting
<br>
probability, Omega'', which is known only by a third-order oracle, and
<br>
so on.  According to Chaitin, there exists an infinite sequence of
<br>
increasingly random Omegas. &quot;There is even an all-seeing infinitely
<br>
high-order oracle which knows all other Omegas,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>He kept these numbers to himself for decades, thinking they were too
<br>
bizarre to be relevant to the real world. Just as Turing looked upon his
<br>
God-like computer as a flight of fancy, Chaitin thought these
<br>
Super-Omegas were fantasy numbers emerging from fantasy machines. But
<br>
Veronica Becher of the University of Buenos Aires has shown that Chaitin
<br>
was wrong: the Super-Omegas are both real and important. Chaitin is
<br>
genuinely surprised by this discovery. &quot;Incredibly, they actually have a
<br>
real meaning for real computers,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>Becher has been collaborating with Chaitin for just over a year, and is
<br>
helping to drag Super-Omegas into the real world. As a computer
<br>
scientist, she wondered whether there were links between Omega, the
<br>
higher-order Omegas and real computers.
<br>
<p>Real computers don't just perform finite computations, doing one or a
<br>
few things, and then halt. They can also carry out infinite
<br>
computations, producing an infinite series of results. &quot;Many computer
<br>
applications are designed to produce an infinite amount of output,&quot;
<br>
Becher says. Examples include Web browsers such as Netscape and
<br>
operating systems such as Windows 2000.
<br>
<p>This example gave Becher her first avenue to explore: the probability
<br>
that, over the course of an infinite computation, a machine would
<br>
produce only a finite amount of output. To do this, Becher and her
<br>
student Sergio Daicz used a technique developed by Chaitin. They took a
<br>
real computer and turned it into an approximation of an oracle. The
<br>
&quot;fake oracle&quot; decides that a program halts if--and only if--it halts
<br>
within time T. A real computer can handle this weakened version of the
<br>
halting problem. &quot;Then you let T go to infinity,&quot; Chaitin says. This
<br>
allows the shortcomings of the fake to diminish as it runs for longer
<br>
and longer.
<br>
<p>Using variations on this technique, Becher and Daicz found that the
<br>
probability that an infinite computation produces only a finite amount
<br>
of output is the same as Omega', the halting probability of the oracle.
<br>
Going further, they showed that Omega'' is equivalent to the probability
<br>
that, during an infinite computation, a computer will fail to produce an
<br>
output--for example, get no result from a computation and move on to the
<br>
next one--and that it will do this only a finite number of times. 
<br>
<p>These might seem like odd things to bother with, but Chaitin believes
<br>
this is an important step. &quot;Becher's work makes the whole hierarchy of
<br>
Omega numbers seem much more believable,&quot; he says. Things that
<br>
Turing--and Chaitin--imagined were pure fantasy are actually very real.
<br>
<p>Now that the Super-Omegas are being unearthed in the real world, Chaitin
<br>
is sure they will crop up all over mathematics, just like Omega. The
<br>
Super-Omegas are even more random than Omega: if mathematicians were to
<br>
get over Omega's obstacles, they would face an ever-elevated barrier as
<br>
they confronted Becher's results.
<br>
<p>And that has knock-on effects elsewhere. Becher and Chaitin admit that
<br>
the full implications of their new discoveries have yet to become clear,
<br>
but mathematics is central to many aspects of science. Certainly any
<br>
theory of everything, as it attempts to tie together all the facts about
<br>
the Universe, would need to jump an infinite number of hurdles to prove
<br>
its worth. 
<br>
<p>The discovery of Omega has exposed gaping holes in mathematics, making
<br>
research in the field look like playing a lottery, and it has demolished
<br>
hopes of a theory of everything. Who knows what the Super-Omegas are
<br>
capable of? &quot;This,&quot; Chaitin warns, &quot;is just the beginning.&quot;
