<p>Nice idea, but - from reading TPtS (for those who haven't read: it's
<br>
linked off of CaTAI, and basically the &quot;so how do we do it?&quot; part), it
<br>
sounds like the seed somehow requires Flare as Eleizer has dreamed it
<br>
up, to go beyond initial stages.  (At least, crediting it with being
<br>
able to &quot;create the potential for the timeline&quot; that leads to an AI,
<br>
and similar comments, is pretty suggestive in that regard IMO.)
<br>
Without the specs for Flare, it is difficult to see how Flare solves
<br>
the problems it is credited with solving, yet the plan assumes that
<br>
Flare has solved them.
