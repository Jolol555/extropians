<p>
First of all, I have to remark most of Argentina's university system is
<br>
public,
<br>
free, and managed by the national government. There are cultural and
<br>
historical
<br>
reasons for this (and political!), but to make things short, I will just say
<br>
this is the situation. Private universities are few and expensive, attended
<br>
only
<br>
by those fewest lucky ones of the higher social classes (which constitute
<br>
less
<br>
than 5% of the population). These fewest are indeed so fewest, quite some
<br>
private universities have found themselves at odds to make ends meet in past
<br>
years. And of course, private businessmen have little interest in investing
<br>
in
<br>
these universities, their operations in Argentina are based mainly on
<br>
agro-industrial production and manufactures, so low skill workers are more
<br>
than
<br>
enough.
<br>
<p>Argentina spends just the 3.5% or so of its GDP on education. Some reasons
<br>
for
<br>
this are that GDP (traditionally weak) has dropped a lot, national debt
<br>
payments
<br>
have grown a lot, and government is basically funding only the essentials in
<br>
every item of the national budget. For universities, this means most of the
<br>
budget goes into wages and building upkeep. Typical figures put wages as
<br>
taking
<br>
up to 70% of university budgets. Add the upkeep costs of buildings, and
<br>
remember
<br>
this is a real meager budget, and you have to wonder how much money do
<br>
people
<br>
receive for research. Almost nothing. The fact that there is any reseach
<br>
going
<br>
on is sort of a miracle, in my opinion.
<br>
<p>This doesn't mean buildings and facilities are shiny and great, either. As
<br>
only
<br>
basic upkeep can be afforded with the limited budget, you very rarely have
<br>
anything else but a blackboard and a cramped, badly lit classroom to do your
<br>
trick. Computer labs are few and ridiculously underfit, students typically
<br>
have
<br>
a couple of hours computer time a week, if that. Subjects where materials
<br>
and
<br>
equipment are critical (say, electrical engineering) can barely offer a
<br>
glimpse
<br>
of practical lab skills. Libraries, well, libraries are filled with old,
<br>
almost
<br>
historical curiosities, of textbooks. My origin university could usually
<br>
afford
<br>
100-200 new volumes each year, when I was leaving for my PhD here in Sweden.
<br>
I'm
<br>
told it's even less now. Suscription to academic journals or procedures is
<br>
almost unheard of, perhaps 3 or 4 for each department. Funding for sending
<br>
researchers to conferences abroad is equally non-existant. If you have one
<br>
of
<br>
the higher faculty positions, you may be allowed one trip abroad each year.
<br>
Quality postgraduate students are lucky if they get some funding for one
<br>
domestic conference/school each year.
<br>
<p>There are (rare) international cooperation programs, some little research
<br>
comes
<br>
from them thanks to the generosity of foreign researchers. There are (ok,
<br>
they
<br>
WERE) even some loans for advanced research and sending people abroad to get
<br>
good education, but these programs were killed when the IMF imposed to the
<br>
government a &quot;rationalization&quot; expenditure effort. Education foreign loans
<br>
were
<br>
the first to go. Which makes me an unhappy man, since I was staying in
<br>
Sweden
<br>
within one of said programs. I'm still trying to see what the blazes to do
<br>
if
<br>
the Swedes don't give me their own scholaship to finish up here (still 2
<br>
years
<br>
to go).
<br>
<p>That research and education still happen in our universities is mainly due
<br>
to
<br>
people making great personal sacrifices to achieve it. 20% of university
<br>
faculty
<br>
work for free (&quot;ad honorem&quot;), either because there is no funding to pay
<br>
them, or
<br>
because they have another job outside academia (to earn a living) and they
<br>
teach
<br>
as a personal compromise/thankfulness with the university that formed them.
<br>
They
<br>
are not naive: they know things will not change a jot, even in 20 years, and
<br>
they will not see a dime in return. Probably even longer. They still chose
<br>
to do
<br>
so in an amazing feat of solidarity. Of course, there are few such
<br>
remarkable
<br>
people, and most of the time when universities can't pay even a very low
<br>
wage
<br>
the positions simply remain empty, and existing faculty has to double or
<br>
triple
<br>
their efforts to provide at least a minimum offer of courses that will allow
<br>
students to have a full programme. One of the many niceties the government
<br>
has
<br>
been forced to do to meet IMF's administration standards is cutting wages
<br>
for
<br>
faculty earning over 1000 USD. In most cases the cuts have been around 10%
<br>
or
<br>
more. You may think people would move to private sector, right? Well, with
<br>
the
<br>
unemployment rate (stable around 15%) and subemployment rate (empl.+subemp.
<br>
combined take around 30% rate), they are happy they still have a job. So
<br>
they
<br>
keep it, even with ridiculous wages. Understaffing and overwork are common
<br>
as
<br>
air.
<br>
<p>More about wages. Of those 80% faculty who do get a check for their job,
<br>
2/3rds
<br>
earn 2.8 USD/hour. Considering their contracts allow only for 10 hrs/week
<br>
work
<br>
(another nice imposition of IMF, they call it &quot;flexibilization&quot;... isn't
<br>
semantics nice?), these 2/3rds of faculty earn around 120 USD/month
<br>
(position
<br>
would be like &quot;teaching assistant&quot;). Needless to say, they must resort to
<br>
several simultaneous positions, or external jobs. Also needless to say, they
<br>
spend way more than 10 hours/week working to keep the courses functioning
<br>
even
<br>
at a basic level, but the extra hours are not officially recognised or paid.
<br>
In
<br>
any case, the quality of their teaching is severely handicapped, and
<br>
stress/outside work takes their toll. About 1/6th of faculty are in the next
<br>
higher position (sort of &quot;regular professorship&quot; position), they earn about
<br>
5.5
<br>
USD/hour, and about 440 USD/month. Again, many of them have to resort to
<br>
multiple positions and outside work. Again, quality suffers greatly. The
<br>
final
<br>
1/6th earns around 6.3 USD/hour, and about 1000 USD/month average. These
<br>
people
<br>
are usually long time professors (&quot;special professorship&quot;), with 10 or more
<br>
continuous years in the position. Many work on parallel as chairs, academic
<br>
secretaries, and similar organizational duties, without receiving any extra
<br>
income for it in most cases. Faculty earning 1500-2000 USD/month is very
<br>
rare,
<br>
usually due to a long standing in their position or historical chairs.
<br>
<p>It gets even worse. Regretfully, not all faculty are like these amazing
<br>
people
<br>
doing ad honorem work or accepting ridiculous wages to do many times the
<br>
work
<br>
their contract marks them to do. There are quite some academics that simply
<br>
cling to their positions like parasites. They are mediocre, snobbish, and
<br>
stagnate the little research and advacement that still happens. But, they
<br>
have
<br>
the political connections, so they keep their positions. The political class
<br>
dabbles shamelessly on university life, and keeping their friends in nice
<br>
positions is only one of their goals. They also actively recruit militants
<br>
within the students, which are (for traditional cultural reasons) already
<br>
much
<br>
politicized. Many of the successful (and less scrupulous) student militants
<br>
are
<br>
quickly absorbed into the party machinery. This perpetuates the dabbling,
<br>
since
<br>
once graduated, these recruits in turn dabble into the university life with
<br>
the
<br>
same lack of scruples their party mentors showed up. Many of these parasitic
<br>
faculty are encrusted into the surviving research system too, which makes
<br>
for
<br>
all kinds of shady and incompetent deals. Nepotism, bribery, and criminal
<br>
incompetence are not unheard of.
<br>
<p>Now I should mention how it is for students. Forget about scholarships or
<br>
such,
<br>
at least for the big part of them there is nothing like that they can resort
<br>
to.
<br>
60% of university students have to work to support their studies. As I
<br>
mentioned, the unemployment/subemployment rates being what they are, they
<br>
are
<br>
lucky if they do get said jobs. Still, the number of students entering the
<br>
university system keeps increasing! And the reason for this is simply that
<br>
they
<br>
want to get a degree, since the very few job opportunities out there can be
<br>
fought for with better luck with such degree. This would be a great
<br>
philosophy
<br>
of life and all that, if it were not for the jobs they are applying to being
<br>
menial work, shop attendants, clerks, and similar very low skill chores. The
<br>
result is one of the most highly educated &quot;unskilled worker&quot; segment around
<br>
the
<br>
world. ;-)
<br>
<p>In closing: without money, resources or infrastructure, our academics manage
<br>
to
<br>
produce graduates with a reasonable level of quality. And they do this
<br>
fighting
<br>
the political establishment, incompetent governments, and even their own
<br>
fossilized colleagues. The only reason for this minor victory is the
<br>
personal
<br>
compromise and sacrifice of these academics. In a country in which
<br>
concentration
<br>
camps, urban guerilla, chronic leadership ineptitude, cultural fascism, and
<br>
economic exploitation have been rampart until recently, many of the
<br>
academics of
<br>
international quality look at this in despair and go away to some decent
<br>
foreign
<br>
place, where they can actually achieve their scientific potential. I can't
<br>
blame
<br>
them. But I guess I have been infected with the &quot;compromise virus&quot;, and I
<br>
admire
<br>
and appreciate hugely the people who allowed me to have an university
<br>
education
<br>
due to their sacrifice and insane amounts of work. I hope I can be half as
<br>
good,
<br>
half as hard-working, as they were, when I get back and join the bucket
<br>
brigade.
<br>
The world would be a much darker and aimless place for me if their effort
<br>
turns
<br>
out to be in vain.
