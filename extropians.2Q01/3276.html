Which is so trivial an assertion as to be of no consequence whatsoever.
<br>
Yes, of course, we're all the product of our past, for some broad enough
<br>
meaning of &quot;past&quot;. So what? I feel this assertion of yours is often used
<br>
as some kind of hidden excuse for one's utter lack of critical sense
<br>
as regard a particular, very narrow, part of one's past.
<br>
BTW, what's that &quot;pomo-&quot; prefix? &quot;post-modernist&quot;? no comment.
<br>
<p>I reject your narrow social determinism.
<br>
My dad is a mildly socialist blasé; he was raised a fervent catholic
<br>
conservative by family and school, but faced some harsh realities of
<br>
french history, and grew to accept the socialist leaning of France.
<br>
My mom is a nationalist conservative living abroad; she was raised in
<br>
a vietnamese family torn between the tradition and modernity.
<br>
I'm a libertarian, having been raised a green-socialist at school,
<br>
like every good little frenchmen (and I was a _very_ good little frenchman,
<br>
at school and in front of the tv set).
<br>
So yes, my opinions are somehow the fruit of my past of being confronted
<br>
to lots of different opinions, with reason as my guide (both the
<br>
confrontation to the broadest variety of opinions and the critical eye
<br>
to have of them being happily encouraged by my family, despite its late
<br>
results of radically opposing both my parents in my opinions).
<br>
But then what? But then, among all the people's pasts, if one should
<br>
be more objective, it might precisely be one who's developed more
<br>
critical sense since the earlier stages of one's life, and applied it
<br>
to the broader base of hypotheses with the least a priori.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But there is no certainty in values or politics,
</em><br>
Here's a loathable self-defeating statement.

Invoking relativism is only a hypocritical way to dismiss reason, with only
<br>
sheer force being left. It's abdication of reason, denial of everything that
<br>
makes the dignity of man.
