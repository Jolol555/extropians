</em><br>
<p>There are some independent reasons for thinking that we'll develop a 
<br>
&quot;singleton&quot;, i.e. a world order in which there is a single power that has 
<br>
complete control and is stable. (Internally, this singleton may have many 
<br>
competing interests - say, different individuals whose votes determine the 
<br>
actions of the singleton.) One reason is that we might realize that a 
<br>
singleton is the only way of preventing a black goo disaster. Another is 
<br>
that we might understand that this degree of coordination is necessary to 
<br>
avoid Robin's Burning of the Cosmic Commons scenario. A third reason is 
<br>
that if there is a singularity then the transcending power might well get 
<br>
enough power to become a singleton.
<br>
<p>The problematic assumption is not that we might develop into a singleton, 
<br>
but that virtually every posthuman civilization does so, and into the same 
<br>
kind of singleton, i.e. one that prevents their members from running 
<br>
ancestor-simulations. This requires a rather strong convergence-hypothesis 
<br>
(&quot;all advanced civilization evolve in the same direction&quot;), but it is real 
<br>
possibility in my opinion, and indeed is the scenario that we should hope 
<br>
is correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and death, its only *virtual*.  Where is the harm in that?  Yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you can argue that the people in the simulation don't know its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;virtual, but their opinions don't count -- they aren't real either.
</em><br>
<p>Where is the harm? If you are injured, you know exactly where the harm is. 
<br>
It doesn't matter whether you are living in a simulation or on the 
<br>
basement-level.
<br>
<p>It would be a fundamental mistake to think of simulations as not fully 
<br>
real. Simulations are events in the physical basement universe. If the 
<br>
beings in the simulations are conscious then their well-being is as 
<br>
ethically important as that of those who are implemented directly in 
<br>
biological brains in the basement universe.
<br>
<p>Note that freedom of thought may not apply in unrestricted form to beings 
<br>
whose powers of imagination are so advanced that when they think about 
<br>
somebody that person thereby comes into existence. (If your thinking 
<br>
processes involved running a detailed simulation, this could happen.) You 
<br>
wouldn't be allowed to think certain thoughts for the same reason that a 
<br>
human is not allowed to have a child and maltreat it. Thinking is not a 
<br>
private matter when it directly affects somebody else.
