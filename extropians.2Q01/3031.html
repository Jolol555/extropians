<p>
I'm pleased to announce that my latest science fiction novel, TRANSCENSION,
<br>
has just been bought by Tor Books in New York. At this stage I don't know
<br>
when it will appear--not for another year, I'd expect, given the
<br>
sluggishness of paper publication.
<br>
<p>Although the novel will [probably] appear with only my name on the cover,
<br>
it includes substantial chunks drafted by Rory Barnes and Barbara Lamar
<br>
(who naturally are acknowledged in the book and share in the royalties),
<br>
and epigraphs by Eugene Leitl and Eliezer Yudkowsky.
<br>
<p>Without giving too much away, the novel deals with life following the
<br>
emergence of a seed AI based on a cryonically suspended brain, in a world
<br>
throttled to a large extent by the strictures of the Joyous Relinquishment.
<br>
<p>More news when publication is imminent.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, of course, you can download the revised version of THE DREAMING
<br>
(and you know I was just kidding about the Hoagland/Antarctic connection,
<br>
don't you? Don't you?) at

<br>
<p>The blurb they have listed is pretty munged. It should, and will, read like
<br>
this:
<br>
<p>---------------
<br>
<p>In this novel specially updated for Fictionwise by the author, an
<br>
anthropologist travels to the central    Australian desert to search for
<br>
the source of an aboriginal myth. He is astonishing to find the source of
<br>
the terrible &quot;Rainbow Serpent&quot; deep beneath the sacred Uluru rock
<br>
formations, now the site of a top-secret military project. The apparently
<br>
holographic &quot;Gate&quot; he discovers with his nephew leads not just to the
<br>
origin of a legend, but to the origin of humanity and the true fate of the
<br>
dinosaurs, in an escalating series of conceptual breakthroughs that
<br>
shockingly revises everything we have ever believed about humankind.  1980

Fiction); Year's Best SF Pick
