<em> &gt; Count me in. My fathered worked on the original British Concorde near 
</em><br>

feel 
<br>
<em> &gt; right -- even though for most of it we will be travelling mostly virtually.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt;.While Concorde is extremely cool,  I can't help thinking that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SST's are a very nineteen-sixties kind of project. Why can't
</em><br>
&nbsp;...&gt;we look forward to cheap, universal teleportation instead?
<br>
<em>  &gt;I'll settle for the speed of light, thank you very much.

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn straight, Teleportation is the key to future transport. Ive been 
<br>
dreaming of building point to point wormhole transport systems for years. Im 
<br>
not talking Dial a planet StarGates like in the film or TV program. I'm 
<br>
thinking more along the lines of constant 2 way wormholes just like tunnels 
<br>
through a mountain. You drive in at london and come straight out in florida. 
<br>
no Flashing lights, special effects, wobbly slow sounds etc, just drive 
<br>
through no fuss.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its a long way off but I envisage small PTPS devices (Point to Point 
<br>
Singularity) used in mundain things like Telecoms. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine , stuff in a fibre optic cable in at London and out it comes in 
<br>
New York. You could span the distance with a 1 metre cable. It would 
<br>
revolutionise Data coms. Building a WAN would be easy. The hard part would be 
<br>
flying 3000 miles to plug the cable in at the other end. :o)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing that has bothered me is things like The difference in Air 
<br>
preasure between the 2 PTPS devices, say the atmoshperic preasure In London 
<br>
is 14.7 psi and in New York it is 15.2. It may not be a big difference but 
<br>
therewould be one hell of a wind rushing through the wormhole. With bigger 
<br>
devices there may even be wide reaching impact on weather patterns due to 
<br>
&quot;Unatural&quot; winds and air movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a reasonably small problem here on earth but imagine a 
<br>
wormhole to the moon. Kiss the Atmosphere goodbye ! or could we even take 
<br>
advatage of this interplanetary effect and harness it for teraforming 
<br>
purposes. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Instant travel by means of teleport or wormhole is a fantastic idea 
<br>
that has been knocking around for years, but it will need some very carefull 
<br>
thought before we explosively decompress the whole planet.
