All true (although unless you have a really really large amount of money
<br>
to blow, buying stock in any public stock with a decent daily volume is
<br>
not going to have any impact at all when it comes to &quot;supporting the price&quot;)
<br>
I guess, but it remains important to draw a big line between directly
<br>
investing in a company you want to help vs. indirect methods. In terms of
<br>
real impact of your capital the former probably has orders of magnitude more
<br>
effectiveness.
<br>
<p>In other words going out and buying $100,000 worth of Intel stock ain't
<br>
going to get the Singularity or nanotech or anything else here faster. But
<br>
if you take that money and put it into a startup venture to pursue some new
<br>
technology then you would have a chance at making something happen.

<em>&gt; &gt; Of course remember: if you really intend on /helping/ the companies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  question, you have to invest during the IPO or before. Otherwise your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  cash is just going to some other random person/org, not the company itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, this isn't true in almost all cases.  First, the entrepreneurs who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start and build the company almost always retain some fairly significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; portion of the stock of the company.  So 1) you may be buying the stock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly from such an &quot;insider&quot;, thus providing a direct return to the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who's energy and inventiveness you want to reward and 2) even a purchase from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a non-insider serves to support the stock price, providing an indirect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit to those people.  Second, companies often possess &quot;treasury stock&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e. &quot;issued&quot; stock that hasn't yet been sold to the public.  Such shares
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serve as a kind of private currency for the company that they use to both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raise cash and regulate the market value of their equity.  Finally, as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point out above, every purchase of a company's shares serves to support its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value, which is a continuing issue for any company.  Buying XYZ, Inc.'s stock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today may be helping it to raise new money, by serving as a signal of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value to new direct investors or lenders.
