<em>&gt; Unless, of course, Moore's Law does not apply to Great Brains.
</em><br>
<p>Interestingly enough, Stapledon's Last Men have a life
<br>
cycle that lasts until it becomes clear that an individual is
<br>
obsolete:
<br>
<p>&quot;The number of children in our world is small in relation to our
<br>
immense population.  Yet, seeing that every one of us is potentially
<br>
immortal, it may be wondered how we can permit ourselves to have
<br>
any children at all.  The explanation is two-fold.  In the first
<br>
place, our policy is to produce new individuals of higher type
<br>
than ourselves, for we are very far from biologically perfect.
<br>
Consequently we need a continuous supply of children.  And as
<br>
these successively reach maturity, they take over the functions
<br>
of adults whose nature is less perfect; and these, when they
<br>
are aware that they are no longer of service, elect to retire from
<br>
life.
<br>
<p>But even though every individual, sooner or later, ceases to exist,
<br>
the average length of life is not much less than a quarter of
<br>
a million terrestrial years...&quot;
<br>
<p>-- _Last and First Men_, Chapter XV &quot;The Last Men&quot;,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2. &quot;Childhood and Maturity&quot;.
<br>
<p>There are some other fascinating things about the
<br>
Last Men that Stapledon imagined -- for instance, that in adolescence
<br>
(which they enter about a thousand years after birth), they spend
<br>
a millennium in an antarctic continent called &quot;The Land of the Young&quot;,
<br>
where they essentially participate in a life-and-death game of
<br>
recapitulating the history of the human race.  Only after this
<br>
educational adventure are they considered fit for adulthood:
<br>
<p>&quot;When our children attain physical adolescence, nearly a thousand
<br>
years after birth, they leave the safe paths of childhood to
<br>
spend another thousand years in one of the antarctic continents,
<br>
known as the Land of the Young...  In this land our young people
<br>
live the half primitive, half sophisticated life to which their
<br>
nature is fitted.  They hunt, fish, tend cattle and till the
<br>
ground.  They cultivate all the simple beauties of human
<br>
individuality.  They love and hate.  They sing, paint and carve.
<br>
They devise heroic myths, and delight in fantasies of direct
<br>
intercourse with a cosmic person.  They organize themselves in
<br>
tribes and nations.  Sometimes they even indulge in warfare of a
<br>
primitive but bloody type.  Formerly when this happened, the
<br>
adult world interfered; but we have since learned to let the fever
<br>
run its course.  The loss of life is regrettable; but it is a
<br>
small price to pay for the insight afforded even by this restricted
<br>
and juvenile warfare, into those primitive agonies and passions
<br>
which, when they are experienced by the adult mind, are so
<br>
transformed by philosophy that their import is wholly changed.
<br>
In the Land of the Young, our boys and girls experience all that
<br>
is precious and all that is abject in the primitive.  They live
<br>
through, in their own persons, century by century, all its
<br>
toilsomeness and cramped meanness, all its blind cruelty and
<br>
precariousness; but also they taste its glamour, its vernal and
<br>
lyrical glory.  They make in little all the mistakes of thought
<br>
and action that men have ever made; but at last they emerge ready
<br>
for the larger and more difficult world of maturity.&quot;
<br>
<p>-- Ibid.
<br>
<p>Finally, the novel ends with this lyrical description of
<br>
the last born of the Last Men:
<br>
<p>&quot;But there is one among us, moving from place to place and
<br>
company to company, whose voice all long to hear.  He is young,
<br>
the last born of the Last Men; for he was the latest to be
<br>
conceived before we learned man's doom, and put an end to all
<br>
conceiving.  Being the latest, he is also the noblest.  Not
<br>
him alone, but all his generation, we salute, and look to for
<br>
strength; but he, the youngest, is different from the rest.
<br>
In him the spirit, which is but the flesh awakened into spirituality,
<br>
has power to withstand the tempest of solar energy longer than
<br>
the rest of us.  It is as though the sun itself were eclipsed by
<br>
this spirit's brightness.  It is as though in him at last, and
<br>
for a day only, man's promise were fulfilled.  For though, like
<br>
others, he suffers in the flesh, he is above his suffering.
<br>
And though more than the rest of us he feels the suffering of
<br>
others, he is above his pity.  In his comforting there is a
<br>
strange sweet raillery which can persuade the sufferer to smile
<br>
at his own pain.  When this youngest brother of ours
<br>
contemplates with us our dying world and the frustration of
<br>
all man's striving, he is not, like us, dismayed, but quiet.
<br>
In the presence of such quietness despair wakens into peace.
<br>
By his reasonable speech, almost by the mere sound of his
<br>
voice, our eyes are opened, and our hearts mysteriously filled
<br>
with exultation.  Yet often his words are grave.
<br>
<p>Let his words, not mine, close this story:
<br>
<p>'Great are the stars, and man is of no account to them.  But
<br>
man is a fair spirit, whom a star conceived and a star kills.
<br>
He is greater than those bright blind companies.  For though
<br>
in them there is incalculable potential, in him there is
<br>
achievement, small, but actual.  Too soon, seemingly,
<br>
he comes to his end.  But when he is done he will not be
<br>
nothing, not as though he had never been; for he is eternally
<br>
a beauty in the eternal form of things...'&quot;
