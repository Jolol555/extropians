<p><em>&gt;&gt; I think this came from Hungary. (an &quot;.hu&quot; email address). Pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; compelling argument!  ;-)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;OK, analysing something like this is in itself an exercise in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;silliness or too much seriousness. But I think it reveals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something about the memes we have to struggle against, and I am a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tired swede for the moment :-). The core of the confused mail
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems to be that 1) being a cyborg is not fun, 2) extropianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seeks to turn everybody into cyborgs.
</em><br>
<p>This reads like whatever this person has read about us consisted of
<br>
one of those strange and inaccurate views often published by
<br>
various reporters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;1 is of course open to argument, but I think we can make a pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good case based on our views of self-enhancement, living
</em><br>
<em>&gt;designed/deliberate lives and individual growth that at least some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people will find being a cyborg great. This goes against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;humanism&quot; often expressed that there is something particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good about the current human condition.
</em><br>
<p>I am reminded of the classic Shaper/Mechanix dichotomy of Bruce
<br>
Sterling. A Transhuman could from outward appearances look like
<br>
anyone else, but be completely enhanced inside. In fact I believe
<br>
this is the way it will happen. How many hundreds of thousands or
<br>
even millions of people undergoe aesthetic (&quot;plastic&quot;) surgery now.
<br>
<p>A future Transhuman could be both the most interesting and
<br>
attractive person you'd ever meet, remember the Sterling shaper who
<br>
sweated perfume?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;2 is based on the common view that any ideology has to prescribe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behavior for not just its adherents but everyone else too. While
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we might have views on universal principles, I don't think any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;currently existing branch of transhumanism seriously proposes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imposing itself on non-transhumanists (it would go very deeply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against the same individual autonomy and freedom that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanism tries to enhance). It is basically the classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liberal view that there is a private morality for everyone; after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we have settled on the public morality needed to keep our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;societies working it should not be extended into the private moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sphere. But many people are so used to ideologies claiming the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right to regulate everything and everyone, that they have a hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time recognising just how tolerant transhumanism is. 
</em><br>
<p>Well put, I agree 100%. Get some rest now....
