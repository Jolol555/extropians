</em><br>
<p>No problems with that. But I think some of the macros you use are non-trivial 
<br>
and in a discussion like this they ought to be on the visible level. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I agree with your sketch of the hardware/software gap, but it is not

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; improvements in hardware until the fateful quantum leap. Right now it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm extrapolating the peristance of the trend from past history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the last four-five decades, only two-three more yet to go),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and lack of awareness of the problem set. The field, still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being rather young, has settled into rather heavy dogma already.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Holistic approaches are being actively deprecated, since breaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstraction's usability. Lunatic fringe approaches, some of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely fruitful on the long run do not receive the attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they deserve, because appearing sterile on the short run. I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go on, but I think that part of the problem is for real.
</em><br>
<p>People are very aware about the problem, IMHO. It is just that so far many of 
<br>
the solutions have not panned out, making people rather risk-aversive when it 
<br>
comes to new approaches. But given how quickly people also hang on to new 
<br>
computing trends when they become fashionable and have enough mass, I don't 
<br>
think a method of better software efficiency would be ignored if it could 
<br>
demonstrate a measurable improvement. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We do not have many datapoints as to amplitude of the growing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance gap between the average case and the best case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but current early precursors of reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to generate extremely compact, nonobvious solutions even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using current primitive evolutionary algorithms. 
</em><br>
<p>Evolutionary algorithms are great for specialised modules, but lousy at less 
<br>
well defined problems or when the complexity of the problem makes the 
<br>
evolutionary search space too nasty. I don't think we will get a dramatic 
<br>
jump in software abilities through stringing together efficient small modules 
<br>
since as you say the glueing is the hard part and not easy to evolve itself. 
<br>
On the other hand, it seems to be a way to help improve software and hardware 
<br>
a bit by making the hardware adaptable to the software, which is after all a 
<br>
nice thing. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see two major driving factors for the punctuated equilibrium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the Jack-in-the-Box-Golem) script: the positive autofeedback of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mutation function, and the hostile takeover of the computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources of the global network.
</em><br>
<p>My experience with evolving mutation functions and fitness landscapes suggest 
<br>
that this is a very hard problem. Computing cycles help, but I am not that 
<br>
optimistic about positive feedback scenarios. The problem is likely that the 
<br>
mutation function is problem-dependent, and for arbitrary, ill-defined and 
<br>
complex problems there are no good muctation functions. Life only had to 
<br>
solve the problem of adapting to staying alive, the rest was largely random 
<br>
experimentation (with sudden bangs like Cambrium when occasional tricks 
<br>
became available). 
<br>
<p>As for taking over computational resources, that implies that intelligence is 
<br>
just a question of sufficient resrources and not much of an algorithmic 
<br>
problem. But so far all evidence seem to point towards algorithms being very 
<br>
important; having more resources speed up research, but I have not seen any 
<br>
evidence (yes, not even Moravec's _Robot_) that suggest that if we could just 
<br>
use a lot of computing power we would get smarter behavior. Besides, hostile 
<br>
takeovers of net resources are rather uncertain operations, highly dependent 
<br>
on the security culture at the time, which is hard to predict. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a very favourable scenario, especially if it occurs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively early, because it highly hardens the network layer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against future perversion attempts by virtue of establishing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a baseline diversity and response adaptiveness.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like a good defense in court :-)
