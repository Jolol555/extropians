<em>&gt; There's another difference between this Earth and an Earth in which we
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; undergone a major extinction event which violated the rights of six

</em><br>
<p>Huh?  A non-conscious event like a ten kilometer meteor causing a very bad
<br>
day for all, cannot be called a rights violation.  There is no conscious
<br>
actor.  And this has nothing to do with the point being discussed anyway.
<br>
<p>But then, I may have lost what the point is as it has taken a couple of
<br>
turns.
<br>
<p>Personally I don't like the wording and concept of &quot;preserving&quot; human
<br>
beings.  Nor do I think of personal immortality as requiring preserving this
<br>
particular current personality matrix or body.   As I said earlier I see it
<br>
more as a preserving of the experiencing essence (for lack of a better
<br>
neutral word) that will weave itself many personality matrices and wear many
<br>
bodies over time.  The reason I brought that up is because I have run into
<br>
notions from some transhumanists that unless they survive in a form that they
<br>
consider is precisely themselves in a much stricter fashion than what I
<br>
suggest then they don't really have any indefinite lifespan and all.  Some go
<br>
so far as to say they don't know what an upload of themselves would be but it
<br>
would not be themselves but merely a close relation.
<br>
<p>Another reason is because I think it is important to understand that the
<br>
*I*,  the sense of self needs to be a bit more fluid and also stronger than
<br>
it is in many people in order for them to navigate uploading and such
<br>
successfully.
