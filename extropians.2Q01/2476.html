</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's called ethics. By exploiting individuals we deny them their liberty.

</em><br>
<p>I have wondered for quite a while, just how boycotting &quot;exploited&quot; people's 
<br>
goods, say, Nike shoes, because they are made by &quot;underpaid&quot; children, is a 
<br>
good thing for us to do.
<br>
<p>Ditto &quot;sweatshops&quot;. If the choice is between a twelve hour work shift six 
<br>
days a week, and starvation, I would gladly work those hours. ( I tend to 
<br>
do this anyway, but then, I am my own &quot;exploiter&quot;!)
<br>
<p>Even though these children are &quot;exploited&quot; by the standards of America, 
<br>
they may well be the difference between their familys' survival and slow 
<br>
death by starvation. Unless the boycotters are willing to pay the now 
<br>
unemployed kids' families the difference, they may be causing more 
<br>
suffering than they are curing.
<br>
<p>&quot;Exploitation&quot; of a country's citizens is the province of that country's 
<br>
citizens and government. Unless you advocate that we invade, overthrow, and 
<br>
magically raise the standards of living in all impoverished areas, anyway.
<br>
<p>The Western world has enforced a blockade of Iraq for quite a few years 
<br>
now, supposedly to &quot;punish&quot; Saddam Hussein for his invasion of Kuwait and 
<br>
other antisocial acts. He is still comfortably in power, but millions of 
<br>
innocent Iraqis have suffered and died because of the blockade.
<br>
<p>If we invest in third world countries and help them develop an industrial 
<br>
base, they will ultimately take care of their own internal problems in 
<br>
their own way. This is the Libertarian way of handling these problems. US 
<br>
citizens buying products made in third world countries does not in any way 
<br>
affect the freedoms of the workers.
<br>
<p>There is one glaring exception to this rule. If the country in question 
<br>
(China?) uses SLAVE labor, then a boycott will not hurt the workers any 
<br>
more than buying the goods would, since they will not see any profits 
<br>
whatever from sales, unlike &quot;exploited&quot; workers. I consciously try not to 
<br>
buy Chinese goods because of this, at least until I see good evidence that 
<br>
there is no forced labor involved.
<br>
<p>Underpaid workers have the options of forming unions, going on strike, or 
<br>
just quitting, just like they do here. Slave workers have none of these 
<br>
options.
<br>
<p>A useful thing would be a chart showing the labor practices of various 
<br>
countries. If there is government coercion involved in labor, then I would 
<br>
consider a boycott of that country's goods. If the workers are paid the 
<br>
local going wage, let's help them by keeping their employment opportunities 
<br>
open.
