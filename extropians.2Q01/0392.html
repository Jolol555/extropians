<em>&gt; &gt;An informal survey of a law firm where a friend of mine started work last

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This certainly isn't true in my firm, which is among the largest in the
</em><br>
US.
<br>
<em>&gt; Without doing any sort of formal review of the data, but based on 18 years
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; personal experience, I'd say the figure is probably about 50%.  This
</em><br>
probably
<br>
<em>&gt; varies somewhat from firm to firm, based on &quot;institutional culture&quot;: Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firms will tend to have &quot;personalities&quot; that are more welcoming to
</em><br>
diversity
<br>
<em>&gt; in different ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I should probably qualify the above; these experiences are from New Zealand,
<br>
and it is quite possible that social mobility is lower here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Based on my experience, I don't think &quot;very few&quot; is justified, but
</em><br>
certainly
<br>
<em>&gt; a smaller percentage than one would expect if the kind of social and
</em><br>
personal
<br>
<em>&gt; mobility you're discussing were randomly distributed.
</em><br>
<p>Based on a (very) brief investigation with the help of Google
<br>
indicated that, in general (and across all occupations) ~70% of children
<br>
inherit the social
<br>
class of their parents. This leaves 30% to move either up or down.
<br>
<p>Also note that the small amount of social mobility (I would rate 30% to be
<br>
small -
<br>
you may not :) .. ) is not at odd with your estimate of 50% - assuming that
<br>
there are
<br>
larger numbers 'down below' means that a small percentage coming from there
<br>
can have
<br>
a large impact on the upper echelon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As it turns out, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the legal profession in the US, the competition for talent is so intense
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt;  the economic or educational background of a candidate's parents per se is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrelevant to hiring and promotion decisions.  The &quot;great filter&quot; is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; candidate's own academic performance and personality.  Because of the
</em><br>
hunger
<br>
<em>&gt; for diversity in large firms like mine (something we've developed because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we've come to realize that diversity is an element of creativity in our
</em><br>
&quot;firm
<br>
<em>&gt; culture&quot;, which is an economic value that goes straight to our bottom
</em><br>
line),
<br>
<em>&gt; qualified candidates from traditionally &quot;disadvantaged&quot; backgrounds end up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having somewhat greater opportunities than those who come from
</em><br>
&quot;professional&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; family backgrounds.
</em><br>
<p>I seriously doubt, though, whether these advantages will outweigh the
<br>
disadvantages that
<br>
poorer children have.  I don't think anybody here will dispute the fact that
<br>
there is a higher
<br>
correlation between your parents' income and your income than there is
<br>
between iq and your
<br>
income.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think it would be nice to develop ways for folks to be able to both do
</em><br>
science and
<br>
<em>&gt; make more money.  The recent trend toward creating university
</em><br>
commercialization
<br>
<em>&gt; vehicles that allow academic scientists to reap more economic rewards from
</em><br>
their work
<br>
<em>&gt; is a very  good trend, IMO.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm - I haven't heard about this. I'm assuming this is a recent American
<br>
development. Do you have any addresses I can check out?
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Gerhard.
