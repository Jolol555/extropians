I came across an article on the Greenpeace site that got me 
<br>
wondering...(www.greenpeace.org/~ozone/greenfreeze/ ) (see below for an 
<br>
extract). The subject itself doesn’t matter and I’m not trying to start a 
<br>
debate on the ozone layer or on the greens. What impressed me is the way 
<br>
they went about it, i.e. in a positive, proactive -dare I say it?- extropian 
<br>
sort of way. But that’s not the point of this message either. The idea I got 
<br>
from the article has to do with genetically modified crops: could it be 
<br>
feasible to organise the production of, say, a cereal bar made with 
<br>
genetically modified rice (the one with extra vitamin A), maybe in 
<br>
collaboration with a charity involved in bringing it to third world 
<br>
countries? The fact that it contains GM rice would be flaunted, rather than 
<br>
hidden and it could foster a  change in the general public’s perception of 
<br>
GM foods. Any ideas, comments, suggestions on how to proceed? Could 
<br>
(should?) the Extropy Institute itself become involved in this, with a 
<br>
similar role as the one taken by Greenpeace in the refrigerants story?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;THE STORY OF &quot;GREENFREEZE&quot;
</em><br>
In the spring of 1992 Greenpeace brought together scientists who had 
<br>
extensively researched the use of propane and butane as refrigerants, with 
<br>
an East German company DKK Scharfenstein. The company had been producing 
<br>
refrigerators for 50 years and was the leading household appliance 
<br>
manufacturer in the former East Germany. After reunification, however, it 
<br>
faced severe economic problems and was due to be closed down.
<br>
The meeting between the scientists and DKK Scharfenstein resulted in the 
<br>
birth of 'Greenfreeze' technology for domestic refrigeration. Greenfreeze 
<br>
refrigerators use hydrocarbons for both the blowing of the insulation foam 
<br>
and the refrigerant and they are entirely free of ozone destroying and 
<br>
global warming chemicals.
<br>
When DKK Scharfenstein announced their intention to mass produce 
<br>
&quot;Greenfreeze&quot;, Greenpeace successfully campaigned to gather tens of 
<br>
thousands of pre-orders for the yet-to-be-produced new refrigerator from 
<br>
environmentally conscious consumers in Germany. This overwhelming support 
<br>
from the public secured the capital investment needed for the new 
<br>
'Greenfreeze' product, and at the same time, salvaged the company and saved 
<br>
the jobs of its workers. &lt;&lt;
