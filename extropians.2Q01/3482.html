<em>&gt; you can only spend your life on one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossibility, after all.
</em><br>
<p>well, no.  I mean, I am married, after all ;D
<br>
<p>Anyway, are two impossibilities more impossible than one?  Isn't the
<br>
siutation sort of like infinity+infinity=infinity?
<br>
<p>But seriously...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Besides which, your visualization of organic integration implies growth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurring on a timescale comparable to the rate of change in human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilizations, which is not realistic for an entity that can absorb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrarily large multiples of its initial hardware, that has a serial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; element speed millions of times faster than neurons, and that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recursively self-improve.  But we've already been through that.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  My guess is that organic integration will occur, and on a slower
<br>
time-scale than the development of nonhuman superintelligence.  I am not so
<br>
certain as you that the development of superhuman superintelligence is going
<br>
to obsolete human life as we know it... just as we have not obsoleted ants
<br>
and cockroaches, though we've changed their lives in many ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If this was a method that relied on the programmer being Mother Theresa,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we might as well shoot ourselves now and be done with it, because humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are by nature imperfect.
</em><br>
<p>Anyway, I've heard she programmed in LISP, and that's a terrible language,
<br>
so...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, it's possible that FAI will work even if you use Saddam Hussein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the exclusive source of content, which would make FAI a plan of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; third kind.  But I can't prove that, and it's not the conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption,...
</em><br>
<p>I tend to think that once the system has gotten smart enough to rewrite its
<br>
own code in ways that we can't understand, it's likely to morph its initial
<br>
goal system into something rather different.  So I'm just not as confident
<br>
in you that explicitly programming in Friendliness as a goal is the magic
<br>
solution.  It's certainly worth doing, but I don't see it as being **as**
<br>
important as positive social integration of the young AI.
<br>
<p>anyway, we've debated this enough I guess.  I'll try to find time to write
<br>
something systematic on it...
