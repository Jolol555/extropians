<em>&gt; &gt; I wouldn't place myself in any of these slots. It would be one thing if
</em><br>
he
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; came down unto us and spake of our misunderstanding -- i.e. &quot;Hey, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans! Your logic is _incompatible_with_the_universe_ you live in, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; again, that is understandable, you were built that way...&quot;; that's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statement of the relationship between the mathematics and the real
</em><br>
world,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but it still wouldn't influence the validity of the pure mathematics --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; axiomatic systems still would be valid, they just wouldn't say anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; useful about the world around us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is very helpful as it helps isolate the source of disagreement. That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics might be full of sound and fury but signifying nothing is of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course not particularly comforting. Someone like Goedel, who thought we
</em><br>
had
<br>
<em>&gt; special intuitionistic access to the logical/mathematical structure of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe, I am sure is rolling over in his grave at your suggestion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this might be the case.
</em><br>
<p>Lol!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If we 'solve' the threefoil by embedding it in 4-space, we step out of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; original system. In 3-space, the problem of finding such an isomorphy is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; definitio unsolvable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'Violations of our most cherished logical laws' cannot be understood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their axiomatic system -- but these violations form _ANOTHER_ axiomatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system, with its own validity, its own pecularities and its own results.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; study of it will with any luck even be rather interesting; but it
</em><br>
doesn't
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have any impact whatsoever on the axiomatic systems already in study,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they build on different axioms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In response let me quote from the great fideist Descartes, (who often goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around in rationalistic drag):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I would dare not even dare to say that God cannot arrange that a mountain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should exist without a valley, or that one and two should not make three;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I only say that He has given me a mind of such a nature that I cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceive a mountain without a valley or a sum of one and two which would
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; be three, and so on, and that such things imply contradictions in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conception.&quot; (Letter to Arnauld, 29 July 1648).
</em><br>
<p>Oh, the second example would be easy:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1+2=0  (mod 3)
<br>
<p>:-)
<br>
<p>Thus, there already exists an axiomatic system in which the sum of one and
<br>
two is not three... :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With respect to your example, Descartes would have to say he cannot
</em><br>
conceive
<br>
<em>&gt; of finding such an isomorphy in  3-space because God has given him such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind, but he dare not say that god could not find such a solution. Of
</em><br>
course
<br>
<em>&gt; you will say that this would be to change the axiom system. Descartes will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond that this may not be so, to assume that it must be the case is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that your understanding extends as far as God's will along this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vector. Of course what the transhumanist fideist must do here is
</em><br>
substitute
<br>
<em>&gt; a created God III here for God.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     You didn't warm to my last analogy but let me try another. Children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes have a difficult time grasping the concept of volume, the usual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistake is to think that a squat beaker which holds say 300 ml is smaller
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a tall slender beaker of equal volume. So if you ask a child what
</em><br>
will
<br>
<em>&gt; happen if you pour the contents of the full tall beaker into the empty
</em><br>
squat
<br>
<em>&gt; beaker they say that it will overflow. Even when one demonstrates that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two beakers are of equal volume, by pouring the liquid from one to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other, some still think that the taller beaker holds more liquid. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes think that there is some slight of hand going on. On this
</em><br>
analogy,
<br>
<em>&gt; then, what looks impossible to us, the 3-space solution may be like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child thinking that the two beakers are equivalent in volume. To say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any solution requires changing the axioms is like the child saying there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be some slight of hand--what the child believes is impossible is
</em><br>
indeed
<br>
<em>&gt; entirely possible. The fideist response then is whether you might believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the magnificently powerful being who claims to be a God III and says that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a 3-space solution within the axioms given, it is just that
</em><br>
humans
<br>
<em>&gt; are too stupid to understand it. Could you imagine your trust going this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far?
</em><br>
<p>Oh yes, I could imagine the trust going this far -- IFF we wouldn't already
<br>
have proven -- within that system -- that it is impossible.
<br>
<p>There is a different between improbable and impossible theorems within an
<br>
axiomatic system. When it comes to a theorem that is proven not to hold,
<br>
then I will not let my trust go 'that far'. If it is about an hypothesis
<br>
that something may hold, for which neither positive nor negative proof
<br>
exists, I readily believe already that it might hold or might not even
<br>
though we have not yet seen it.
