<em>&gt; &gt;We do not want to be or be labeled as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;uncritical cheerleaders of technology for its own sake, but rather as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;proponents of a coherent and defensible set of values that improve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;quality of life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I cannot tell a lie.  Feel free to label me an uncritical cheerleader of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology for its own sake.  I have an ubridled fetish for efficiency.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can be done faster, better, cheaper, I say let's have at it.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't necessarily mean however I'm in favor of all *uses* of efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology.  Hitler after all was the most efficient genocidist in history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But as for the tech itself, I say bring it on no holds barred.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you want a rationalization: it seems very likely that, if
<br>
anyone gets better tech in any area we care about, we will get access
<br>
to it soon thereafter - if we weren't actually the ones to develop it.
<br>
Therefore, development of tech in general is of substantial direct
<br>
benefit to us, with little need for case-by-case justification of the
<br>
uses of each technology.  (There are certain exceptions, but they tend
<br>
to be very obvious.  For instance, developing a highly contagious
<br>
strain of some virus designed to wipe out, or at least severely
<br>
depopulate, all mammalian life on Earth, is not something we'd support
<br>
even though we do support genetic engineering in general.)
