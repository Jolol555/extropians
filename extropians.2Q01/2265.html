</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I guess that makes me a post-post-cognitivist, then.
<br>
<p>Because what I was thinking when I read your preamble was &quot;Hm, the old
<br>
debate about symbols, representational power, and so on.  I'm well out of
<br>
it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Intelligence (&quot;problem-solving&quot;, &quot;stream of consciousness&quot;) is built from
<br>
thoughts.  Thoughts are built from structures of concepts (&quot;categories&quot;,
<br>
&quot;symbols&quot;).  Concepts are built from sensory modalities.  Sensory
<br>
modalities are built from the actual code.
<br>
<p>A classical AI can sort-of represent the &quot;structure&quot; part of &quot;concept
<br>
structures&quot;, but this is the least interesting part, and there never were
<br>
any actual concepts to back them up, just LISP tokens serving as a
<br>
placeholder for concepts.  No amount of targeting information will enable
<br>
you to construct a thought if there are no concepts to construct it with
<br>
and no modality workspace for the thought to be constructed in.
<br>
<p>&quot;Language&quot;, I suppose, would be the innate knowledge of syntax that
<br>
combines with our knowledge of semantic possibilities to enable us to
<br>
translate a serial stream of concept-invoking words into a structure of
<br>
mutually targeting and modifying concepts, such that invoking all the
<br>
concepts within the structure creates an articulated thought in the
<br>
workspace area of the sensory modalities.  For example, &quot;green hotdog&quot;,
<br>
adjective-noun, &quot;green&quot; modifies &quot;hotdog&quot;, &quot;hotdog&quot; fires first, then
<br>
&quot;green&quot; fires and modifies it, and the end result is a picture of a green
<br>
hotdog mapped out across the neurons of your visual cortex.  This picture
<br>
is where the best part of the representational power comes in.  You can
<br>
get a fair degree of representational power from pure deductive reasoning
<br>
some of the time, but learning new concepts, or how to deductively
<br>
manipulate concepts, requires the capability for sensory reconstruction.
<br>
<p>So if you want to know whether CaTAI is symbolic or connectionist AI, the
<br>
answer is a resounding &quot;No&quot;.  This is one of the old, false dichotomies
<br>
that helped to cripple the field of AI.
<br>
<p>As for emotions, they provide some powerful cognitive capabilities as well
<br>
as being the strings whereby our goal systems are manipulated in adaptive
<br>
ways.  But the cognitive capabilities can be duplicated as simple
<br>
reasoning without the need to screw up the entire goal system
<br>
architecture.  An emotionless human is stupid; an AI is not &quot;emotionless&quot;
<br>
but simply a being that reasons and chooses in other ways.
