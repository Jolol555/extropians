<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Stem cells from postmortem brains yield new life
<br>
<p>Visitors to the &quot;What's Hot&quot; section of the Life Extension Foundation's
<br>
website may recall a summary of an abstract presented at the November 2000
<br>
annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience which reported research
<br>
conducted by a team from the Salk Institute in LaJolla, California who
<br>
showed that stem cells derived from cadaver brains could be cultured,
<br>
frozen, and recultured.  Stem cells are unspecialized cells that give rise
<br>
to differentiated cells, which may be able to help repair injured or
<br>
diseased tissue. This research, coauthored by neuroscientist Fred Gage,
<br>
was published this week as a Brief Communication in the journal Nature.
<br>
Dr Gage and colleagues described how tissue was taken from an eleven week
<br>
old postmortem brain and from a surgical biopsy removed from a
<br>
twenty-seven year old brain.  Sections from the motor cortex, hippocampus,
<br>
corpus callosum and ventricular zone were prepared and cultured in a
<br>
medium containing growth factors.  All of the tissue samples yielded
<br>
neural progenitor cells, with the highest yields from the hippocampus and
<br>
ventricular zone.  For longterm storage, the cells were cryopreserved in a
<br>
10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) medium.  Cells from the eleven week old
<br>
tissue sample completed over twice the amount of population doublings than
<br>
the twenty-seven year old tissue before showing signs of a significant
<br>
decline in growth rate, defined as aging.  Neurons were spontaneously
<br>
generated at all stages with more complete differentiation of the cells
<br>
seen when the growth factors were replaced with forskolin and retinoic
<br>
acid.
<br>
<p>Of the twenty-three brain samples similarly cultured so far, a twenty hour
<br>
period is the longest postmortem time from which the researchers have been
<br>
able to successfully culture cells.  Cells cultured from younger donors
<br>
have been found to yield a greater number of neurons.  Further research in
<br>
this area could develop an alternative to embryos as stem cell sources.
<br>
<p>Another article published in the May 3 issue of Nature summarized research
<br>
published in the May 4 2001 issue of the journal Cell, in which stem cells
<br>
derived from bone marrow have been found to have &quot;regenerative powers
<br>
greater than any previously found.&quot;  While previous stem cell research
<br>
used whole groups of bone marrow cells, this research was able to
<br>
specifically identify stem cells, which make up one in 100,000 bone marrow
<br>
cells.  When injected into bone marrow free mice, the stem cells migrated
<br>
to the bone marrow and their offspring were incorporated into lung,
<br>
intestine, skin and stomach.  Research team member Diane Krause of Yale
<br>
University School of Medicine commented, &quot;This is the most astounding
<br>
adult stem cell to date.  It blows me away that organ repair is going on
<br>
constantly from bone-marrow-derived cells.&quot;
<br>
<p>More research is needed to determine how to direct stem cells to specific
<br>
parts of the body.  The researchers believe that the stem cells may be
<br>
comparable to embryonic stem cells.  These and other sources may avoid the
<br>
dilemma of using embryonic stem cells and help to advance research that
<br>
could be otherwise politically curtailed.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Dried human cells brought back to life
<br>
<p>In researched published in the April 21 2001 issue of New Scientist
<br>
Magazine, scientists at the Virginia Tech Center for Genomics in
<br>
Blacksburg, Virginia reported drying kidney cells and rehydrating them
<br>
eight days later to observe half of cells resume normal reproduction. The
<br>
technique, developed by researcher Malcolm Potts, is based on the
<br>
observation of a cyanobacterium that can dry out and survive for centuries
<br>
on rock surfaces by surrounding itself with a substance called glycan that
<br>
protects cell membranes by forming a coating over the cells. Potts and
<br>
colleague David Helm purified glycan and combined it with human kidney
<br>
cells, then dried the cells at room temperature. After eight days, 50% of
<br>
the cells recovered from drying and began dividing, a remarkable feat as
<br>
human cells usually die within seconds when deprived of water. Potts
<br>
announced at a Society for Experimental Biology meeting held this month in
<br>
Canterbury, England, &quot;It's a breakthrough. By applying the techniques we
<br>
have found in cyanobacteria, we can dry out human cells. It's very
<br>
exciting.&quot;
<br>
<p>In a New Scientist article published last year, a researcher at the
<br>
University of California, San Diego reported that human cells dried for
<br>
five days had been revived, but the cells had to be first genetically
<br>
modified to produce trehalose, a sugar that protects cells against
<br>
freezing and drying from the inside. The newest technique utilized
<br>
nonmodifed normal cells.
<br>
<p>The technique may have many possible uses such as prolonged storage of
<br>
blood products and enhanced shelf life for vaccines and antibodies. The
<br>
Virginia Tech researchers hope that in the future tissues and organs could
<br>
be dried and revived, but they don't believe that this will be achieved by
<br>
the use glycan alone. Potts stated, &quot;In the end it's bound to require a
<br>
combination of different approaches.&quot;

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
Chronoforte
<br>
<p>A large body of published evidence has now established that oxidative
<br>
modifications of proteins [carbonylation, etc.] occur during aging and in
<br>
a variety of pathophysiologic conditions, many being neurodegenerative
<br>
diseases including Alzheimer's disease.
<br>
<p>Carbonylation is caused by aldehydes that can be neutralized by
<br>
supplementation with carnosine and by increasing glutathione at the
<br>
cellular level with alpha lipoic acid.
<br>
<p>In addition to protecting against carbonylation, it is crucial to maintain
<br>
youthful mitochondrial energy production and immune function.
<br>
Acetyl-l-carnitine facilitates cellular energy production, while nettle
<br>
leaf extract suppresses high levels of a pro-inflammatory cytokine called
<br>
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) believed to be a cause of immune
<br>
senescence (decline of the immune system in aging).
<br>
<p>ChronoForte is a multi-ingredient anti-aging supplement that provides the
<br>
best documented nutrients to protect against carbonylation and a host of
<br>
other newly identified aging factors.

<p>NADH
<br>
<p>Enada NADH is a coenzyme, antioxidant form of vitamin B3 developed by
<br>
Georg D Birkmayer MD, PhD, and world renowned biochemical researccher.
<br>
NADH is a naturally occurring coenzyme found in all living cells and is
<br>
necessary for cellular development and energy production. Enada NADH is
<br>
absorbed by the body and enhances your ability to restore the body's
<br>
cellular energy source. Enada is a supplement for people whose lifestyle
<br>
demands more energy. Healthy people taking NADH can experience improved
<br>
alertness, concentration and overall energy enhancement.

<p>LAST DAY OF BLOOD TESTING SALE, May 5 2001
<br>
<p>The high cost of blood testing keeps most people from discovering
<br>
correctable risk factors that could predispose them to developing
<br>
degenerative disease. The Life Extension Foundation broke down these high
<br>
price barriers years ago by offering discounted blood tests directly to
<br>
the public. Please note that our retail prices are lower than what most
<br>
commercial laboratories and doctors charge. Until May 5, 2001, The Life
<br>
Extension Buyers Club is offering an extra-special member discount on all
<br>
blood tests.
<br>
<p>Foundation members residing in South Florida can have their blood drawn at
<br>
the Life Extension Nutrition Center located at 1100 Commercial Blvd. in
<br>
Ft. Lauderdale. Those residing outside of South Florida now have access to
<br>
hundreds of licensed blood drawing stations. For information about blood
<br>
testing or directions to any of these blood drawing stations, call
<br>
1-800-208-3444.  When you place your order, you will be sent by a list of
<br>
blood drawing stations in your area. After your blood is drawn, the final
<br>
test results will be mailed directly to you.  To order blood tests, go to
<br>
