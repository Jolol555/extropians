<p>Microsats are nice, yes. But we players won't have the opportunity of going
<br>
crazy in space in quite as expensive a manner if we're not allowed to go to
<br>
Orpheus :-)

institute of AI research' on his CV and a clinical problem with social

<em>&gt; Why don't you just have the biotech engineers come up with a drug that
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Cute! I like it!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The business plan is rather long-range and mainly interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; building the industrial infrastructure needed for large scale habitat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; production (of which there is a predicted tremendous jump in demand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; within 20 years of the start of the operation, due to external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; factors).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Long range business plans can only be financed by very rich people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; VC &amp; Investment bankers wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can of course wait until 20 years when a new generation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hot-shots thinks they know everything and buy into the stupidest stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (The marketing plan for Iridium must now be a B-school classic.)
</em><br>
<p>This is set in 2040 -- so Iridium is long since forgotten, and Iridium the
<br>
sequel is 20 years since :-)
