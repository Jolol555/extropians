<p>Yes, Edelman says something very similar to this:
<br>
<p>&quot;[I]t is probable that there will be severe (but not unique)
<br>
constraints on the design of any artifact that is supposed to
<br>
acquire conscious behavior.  Such constraints are likely to exist
<br>
because there is every indication that an intricate, stochastically
<br>
variant anatomy and synaptic chemistry underlie brain function and
<br>
because consciousness is definitely a process based on an immensely
<br>
intricate and unusual morphology&quot;
<br>
<p>-- Edelman, _The Remembered Present_ pp. 32-33
<br>
<p>The idea that the Internet might someday just &quot;wake up&quot; on its
<br>
own reminds me of a scene in the 1953 movie _The 5000 Fingers of
<br>
Dr. T_ ( <a href="http://a-movie-to-see.com/reviews/5000.php3">http://a-movie-to-see.com/reviews/5000.php3</a> ).
<br>
Young Bart Collins (played by the late Tommy Rettig, &quot;Jeff&quot; in the
<br>
earliest TV version of _Lassie_), oppressed by his piano
<br>
teacher Dr. Terwilliker, has an extended dream in which he is
<br>
a prisoner of Dr. T's Happy Fingers Institute.  Bart and his ally
<br>
Mr. Zabladowski (the plumber) come up with the idea of making a sort
<br>
of airwick that absorbs sound to spoil Dr. T's 500-boy (5000-finger)
<br>
recital (the exact same device appears in an SF short story I once
<br>
read called &quot;Silenzia&quot;).  Their concoctions don't work
<br>
until they get the idea of adding a hearing aid (&quot;sound
<br>
equipment&quot;) to the mix, at which point Mr. Zabladowski warns
<br>
Bart &quot;I never made one of these before, and the stuff that I
<br>
put in there, well it's a kind of revolutionary principle.
<br>
It might be dangerous.  It might even be...  **atomic**!...
<br>
If it starts smoking, you get away from it fast!&quot;
<br>
Later, at the recital, Bart yells out &quot;If you come any closer,
<br>
I'll blow you to smithereens!&quot;  To which Dr. T responds:
<br>
&quot;Is it...  is it **atomic**?&quot;  &quot;Yes sir, **very** atomic!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Take it away!  Take it away!&quot;.
<br>
<p>Watch out for that Internet.  It might be...  **atomic**!
