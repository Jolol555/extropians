<p>
In one of my rare introspective moments, I was thinking to
<br>
myself today, how I so rarely get phone calls that I could
<br>
probably turn off my telephone service and not notice it.
<br>
Then it occured to me that I've got a long-distance e-phone
<br>
call-out capability (with some vendor I can't remember the
<br>
name of, who may no longer be in business...).  I've also
<br>
got an eFax account for incoming faxes.  All I'm missing
<br>
is an eFax type &quot;voice&quot; supplier so that people could
<br>
call me over my DSL connection.
<br>
<p>Now I think the USB-computer telephones are running a couple
<br>
of hundred dollars, but the implication is that I could
<br>
completely cancel my telephone lines and use virtual
<br>
telephone numbers instead.  The savings in telco billing
<br>
should pay for the cost of a handset in a year or so
<br>
(a remarkably fast payoff for a technology transition).
<br>
<p>Now, if people move to this en-mass is the phone company going to
<br>
&quot;wise up&quot; and insist that you pay for voice service on any
<br>
DSL connection?  Will the telephone company &quot;disconnect&quot;
<br>
your DSL line if you close your voice line? (Are these policies
<br>
already spelled out or will they be determined by letters to the
<br>
commission overseeing the Telco and potentially lawsuits?).
<br>
<p>A related question would be does anyone understand IPv6
<br>
sufficiently to tell me how I can get my house allocated
<br>
a permanent block of numbers and lean on the Telco to
<br>
stop charging me for my block of fixed internet addresses
<br>
(something they seem to be playing the &quot;buy&quot; and
<br>
&quot;bump-the-price&quot; game with).
<br>
<p>Now, for the prediction-oriented out there.  Clearly
<br>
at some point, it should become feasible for a company
<br>
to assemble an electronic box (probably a couple of chips)
<br>
that does IPv6 routing over frequencies anyone has access
<br>
to for free.  If you get the frequency hopping algorithms
<br>
correct, everyone should be able to put a world &quot;router&quot;
<br>
in their house.  So for the up-front cost plus the electricity
<br>
to run it you should have access to the local &quot;hub&quot; for free.
<br>
<p>I.e. no telco bill (obviously this buries the telcos
<br>
as we know them).  The barriers to this are
<br>
the design, the limited market (once everyone has
<br>
one they are unlikely to buy two), and the need to
<br>
get &quot;sufficient&quot; mass in cities (1 house per block?).
<br>
However you could develop a B-plan where you give
<br>
away 1/block and sell to all the other people on
<br>
the block to access it.
<br>
<p>Under this scheme, you pay some monthly fee to the
<br>
inter-city hub traffic carrier (you pick the amount).
<br>
They route your messages strictly on a priority basis
<br>
based on how much you are paying per message unit.
<br>
(In other words, you gets what you pay for.)  Presumably
<br>
they have to build the net so that traffic of the highest
<br>
paying customers gets routed responsively at peak times.
<br>
If you choose to communicate at the &quot;off-peak&quot; times,
<br>
you reap the benefits of the people willing to pay
<br>
the &quot;big bucks&quot;.  Now the interesting thing about this
<br>
is that it becomes &quot;self-balancing&quot;.
<br>
<p>Related to this would be an interesting P2P concept
<br>
where cell phones become routers.  If everyone has
<br>
a C.P. why do you need the base stations?  You
<br>
obviously need the B.S. for interstate calls, but
<br>
perhaps not for local calls (which are presumably
<br>
the majority).  [Of course there is a battery/electricity
<br>
cost to using your phone as a router, but can you provide
<br>
an accountng for this.  I.e. when you leave your C.P. in
<br>
the charger so it can serve as a local router, you accumulate
<br>
call time that is deducted when you actually use the phone.
<br>
It becomes quite interesting that people might actually
<br>
derive an income from sticking their C.P. routers in critical
<br>
intercity locations so you capture some fraction of the
<br>
revenue that would otherwise run over the optical links.
<br>
<p>As Harper, from Andromeda (<a href="http://www.andromedatv.com/">http://www.andromedatv.com/</a>)
<br>
might say -- &quot;Am I not a genius?&quot;  (or am I simply so
<br>
stupid that there are a dozen companies working on this
<br>
as I type these words and I'm simply unaware of it?)
