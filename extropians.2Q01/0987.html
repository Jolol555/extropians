<p>Perhaps susceptibility to boredom is the thing that caused humans to

evolve the way we did.  Cows seem to be udderly devoid

of that emotion, and they accomplish little.  Perhaps humans
<br>
evolved as we did because of our species chooses mates
<br>
that are less attractive in return for less boring.  spike
