At 10:38 AM 3/26/01 -0800, Robert replied to my bleat:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; how quickly could such a monster look-up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; table--listed, presumably, by a god, or someone else equal to the task--be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; looked up ?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;you have to state whether you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are running the zombies in the 'real' world or in the simulation.
</em><br>
<p>In the real world, otherwise it isn't interesting (well, to me, anyway).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In the 'real' world, the question is how much memory can you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;put in the brain
</em><br>
<p>Part of my question implied doubt that *you* (anyone) can *put in* a lookup
<br>
table answering to the task. Unless one fell off the back of a god's truck.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 10^28 bits 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Compare that with the &quot;recall&quot; memory of humans of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less than 10^9 bits (&quot;recognition&quot; memory may be higher).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So you can *theoretically* have walking around a lookup table
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of human memories of 10^19 bits. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The recall times can be *very* fast for the reasons I mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the response to Lee.  Whole branches of computer science
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are based on concepts of data caches, locality of reference,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organizing it hierarchically, multiple simultaneous accesses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;etc.  We know how to organize this stuff. 
</em><br>
<p>Great! Now go and find the sequence of canned bits you need *right now*,
<br>
using as many caching levels or whatever as you like. Quick, the impromptu
<br>
poetry contest is about to be won by that toad Blackadder--
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; BTW, this possibility seems to me to fall over dead in just the way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Skinner's behaviorism did when famously assailed by Chomsky 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Could you elaborate on this a bit further?  I'm not connecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the references and the discussion.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I'm taking some shortcuts through the lookup table. Nearly 50 years
<br>
ago, Noam Chomsky (it is widely held) showed that finite-state grammars
<br>
were unequal to the task of explaining productive, creative human speech,
<br>
because we don't say one word then look for another and another after that.
<br>
Does caching solve this? Maybe it does; certainly Chomsky's
<br>
transformational grammar led people to expect the linguistic apparatus to
<br>
be modularised, which was later borne out by direct scans. 
<br>
<p>Chomsky also wrote a brutal review of one of B F Skinner's last books,
<br>
showing why empirical behaviorism failed on similar grounds. You can't see
<br>
the chunkiness of the world unless you're prewired by evolution to look for
<br>
the joints where nature is most readily carved (a view argued earlier by
<br>
Kant); that is, the mind can't be a tabula rasa. Few on this list would
<br>
deny that. But that doesn't mean the templates come pre-stocked, far from
<br>
it. Input and output require *generative* processes that Chomskyans would
<br>
say exceed any look-up table that we could realistically anticipate (in
<br>
nature). Stuart Kauffman, BTW, claims in INVESTIGATIONS that a biosphere is
<br>
emergently complex in *transfinite* measure, which might have some bearing
<br>
on this (or might not). 
<br>
<p>As I understand it, models of cognitive function these days assume at least
<br>
two classes of storage and access: some lookup tables or something like
<br>
them (where the brain checks the index and goes straight to the answer),
<br>
and some constructive imagery procedures where, eg, one wanders around on
<br>
an imaginary map looking for the answer  (the time taken being a linear
<br>
measure of the amount of `mental space' walked through). I'm uncertain how
<br>
Freeman/Hopfield-style attractor models fit into this: I assume that model
<br>
is what neurally underlies the `lookup table' metaphor, even though it's
<br>
instantiated in a quite different structure from a computer, and works by
<br>
completely different principles.
<br>
<p>Chomsky vs Skinner is briefly discussed in Howard Gardner's THE MIND'S NEW
<br>
SCIENCE.
