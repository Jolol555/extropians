<p>So you have &quot;isolated&quot; nodes which handicaps the power of the net
<br>
unless you have an extremely rich communications &quot;shorthand&quot;
<br>
where a few bits translates into trillions on decompression.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The question becomes, what is the nature of the communication

<p>What is the size of the computation you want to do?  Are you sim-ing
<br>
just Spike Jones' mind (that will fit in a node) or humanity (that
<br>
won't [~10^5 &quot;minds&quot;/node]).  You may be able to get away with 
<br>
separating humanity across multiple nodes (must humans communicate
<br>
with most other humans at extremely low bandwidths) but you *will not*
<br>
get away with that strategy of distributing posthumans across the
<br>
nodes.  Post-humans *know* that when you say &quot;explain this to me&quot;
<br>
it is going to involve a kilo-peta-byte transmission and they aren't
<br>
going to want to wait a billion years for it to come across your
<br>
slow data links.
<br>
<p>You have to assume the information at your disposal is within
<br>
a few orders of magnitude of the number of atoms in a node
<br>
(perhaps even *more* than the number of atoms in the node if
<br>
you can map the information onto electron levels reliably).
<br>
<p>If your node weights a kg -- how do you hand &gt; 10^20 bits
<br>
of information (a fraction of what you have available)
<br>
over to another node for review?
<br>
<p>Hmmmmm?
