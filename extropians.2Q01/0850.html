Sorry to reply after such a duration... a busy week!

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: I couldn't let you slide on that one, it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(the conversion of micrograms to milligrams) was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pretty much the only thing I added to the topic. :)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately I also disagree with your volumetric
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis of Hg0. I'm not going to take the time to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;root out a fallacy or do the math myself, instead
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll cut to the quick by noting that a friend with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;far more mathematics education than I (who we both
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know) was also skeptical of the mouth-air measure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of 0.3 mg Hg/m3. He subjected it to examination
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and concluded: &quot;My conclusion was that I could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not disprove the 0.3 mg/m3 figure.&quot; His numbers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were much lower than your numbers. If in fact
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mercury vapor mouth-air reading was incorrect,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the researchers and the peer-review process at the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;journal Neurotoxicology would be shoddy. One would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tend to expect that these experts would get it right:
<br>
<p><p>Neurotoxicology 1997;18(2):315-24
<br>
<p>Mercury vapor inhalation inhibits binding of GTP to tubulin in rat
<br>
brain: similarity to a molecular lesion in Alzheimer diseased brain.
<br>
<p>Pendergrass JC, Haley BE, Vimy MJ, Winfield SA, Lorscheider FL
<br>

<br>
<p>Hg2+ interacts with brain tubulin and disassembles microtubules that
<br>
maintain neurite structure. Since it is well known that Hg vapor (Hg0)
<br>
is continuously released from &quot;silver&quot; amalgam tooth fillings and is
<br>
absorbed into brain, rats were exposed to Hg0 4h/day for 0, 2, 7, 14
<br>
and 28 d at 250 or 300 micrograms Hg/m3 air, concentrations present
<br>
in mouth air of some humans with many amalgam fillings. Average rat
<br>
brain Hg concentrations increased significantly (11-47 fold) with
<br>
duration of Hg0 exposure. By 14 d Hg0 exposure, photoaffinity
<br>
labelling on the beta-subunit of the tubulin dimer with [alpha 32P]
<br>
8N3 GTP in brain homogenates was decreased 41-74%, upon analysis of
<br>
SDS-PAGE autoradiograms. The identical neurochemical lesion of similar
<br>
or greater  magnitude is evident in Alzheimer brain homogenates from
<br>
approximately 80% of patients, when compared to human age-matched
<br>
neurological controls. Total tubulin protein levels remained relatively
<br>
unchanged between Hg0 exposed rat brains and controls, and between
<br>
Alzheimer brains and controls. Since the rate of tubulin polymerization
<br>
is dependent upon binding of GTP to tubulin dimers, we conclude that
<br>
chronic inhalation of low-level Hg0 can inhibit polymerization of
<br>
brain tubulin essential for formation of microtubules.
