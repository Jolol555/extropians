A great parable. I hope many of us takes it to heart, I have noticed a
<br>
disquieting number of transhumanists believing in the lone crusader
<br>
meme.

<em>&gt; Here's the parable.  Suppose you're stuck on a boat in the middle of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ocean with a bunch of people, and they're really hungry, and the boat is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drifting away from the island that you know is to the east.  Suppose you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the **only** person on the boat who can fish well, and also the only person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who can paddle well.  You may be helping the others most by ignoring their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short-term needs (fish) in favor of their longer-term needs (getting to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; island).  If you get them to the island, then eventually they'll get to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; island with lots of food on it, a much better situation than being on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sinking boat with a slightly full stomach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the other people don't **realize** the boat is drifting in the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction, though, because, they don't realize the island is there, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what?  Then they'll just think you're a bit loopy for paddling so hard.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they know you're a great fisherman, they'll be annoyed at you for not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helping them get food....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is this little parable missing?  Sociality.  If you feed the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, they'll be stronger, and maybe they'll be more help in paddling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boat.  Furthermore, if you maintain a friendly relationship with them by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helping them out in ways that they perceive as well as ways that they do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, then they're more likely to collaborate creatively with you in figuring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out ways to save the situation.  Maybe because of their friendship with you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'll take your notion that there's an island to the east more seriously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they'll think about ways to get there faster, and they'll notice a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current that you didn't notice, floating on which will allow you to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there faster with less paddling.
