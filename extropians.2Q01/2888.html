<p>Interesting.  The strike and the P-3 roll could have been near
<br>
simultaneous, so the lost fighter's wingman may very well honestly believe

wasn't paying very close attention and was a distance away.

<p>Of course this doesn't eliminate the fact that by the &quot;rules of the road&quot;
<br>
