<p>I'll take a whack at it, if only because the first thought that crossed
<br>
my mind upon reading this was, &quot;So how does one hack it?&quot;
<br>
<p>First hack: insert entries for phantom/nonexistant people, or only care
<br>
about a few people and use everyone else as &quot;phantoms&quot;.  Give the
<br>
phantoms the extreme opposite rating of what you give everyone else,
<br>
thus pushing your average rating away from the ratings you care about,
<br>
thus increasing their effect (if your own ERA is nonzero).  Potential
<br>
counters: for the inserted entries, limit ability of non-admins to
<br>
create entries for users (though this runs into problems if user
<br>
creation is automatic, for instance if there is one entry for each
<br>
subscriber to a mailing list, but someone owns a mail server and
<br>
subscribes lots of addresses from that server); for the non-caring, not
<br>
sure, but the hack itself necessitates that the effect will be limited
<br>
to a few people.
<br>
<p>Second hack: make sure the system's not popularized, to the point that
<br>
it does not truly reflect community opinion.  This is more of a passive
<br>
failure, since the only &quot;action&quot; is negligence by the admins, though I
<br>
can see some ways of actively pursuing this.
<br>
<p>That's just off the top of my head...except that a system like this
<br>
seems so simple, I think it likely that someone else has proposed
<br>
something like it, so maybe there's documentation on strengths and
<br>
weaknesses of this system somewhere on the Web.  Not sure what terms
<br>
I'd chuck through Google et al to find it, though...
