As far as the orrery goes, maybe John Walker could be persuaded to
<br>
release his source coed for Home Planet.
<br>
<p>As for the rest: well, Falcon 4.0 is perhaps instructive. It shipped
<br>
with lots of bugs, and the passionate effort of manic aficionados
<br>
provided patches and workarounds.
<br>
<p>I think that for practical playability you'd need to have &quot;cold
<br>
sleep&quot;/timelapse for the planetary missions. :)
<br>
<p>But yeah, even a hardcore sim like Falcon--high (more realistic)
<br>
workload, etc.--is a bang bang game, and one of the most decried things
<br>
about it is that you don't get to plan campaigns, just fly a boatload of
<br>
sorties over Korea.
