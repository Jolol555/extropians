Also, it seems the greater the gap in intelligence, the less value the thing
<br>
on the high end ascribes the things on the low end. for example, rank in
<br>
order of value/respect: bacterium, cockroach, toad, mouse, dog, monkey,
<br>
human. Many humans place the value cutoff at the human line.
<br>
Where will an AI draw that line, hmm..?
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>Ayn Rand seemed to have a reasonable segmenting of the different levels of
<br>
thought that may apply to this. She broke it down to 3 levels.
<br>
Sensation: The experience of receiving input directly on a nerve cell, and
<br>
when the stimulus is gone, so is the perception. Bacteria and very simple
<br>
critters rely on the direct stimulus and react method.
<br>
Perception: The experience of taking multiple sensations and being able to
<br>
integrate them into the understanding that there is a particular &quot;thing&quot;
<br>
that one is observing (the cumulative input into your eye, from all those
<br>
rod and cone cells turns out to be &quot;rock&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;car&quot;). Dogs and Cats
<br>
generally live at this layer.
<br>
Conception:  The experience of taking perceptions and understanding that
<br>
there are similarities between certain entities that can be categorized and
<br>
classified. This is where we go from &quot;rock&quot; to &quot;a family of objects I call
<br>
'rock', of which this is simply just one particular instance&quot;, or concepts
<br>
like love, bravery, etc.... Here's where us humans and AIs live.
<br>
I don't think many people would argue that baser animals exist on the
<br>
conception level (although a few tests have show that some chimps make a
<br>
good play for it at times). Unless someone could prove that there is another
<br>
level of consciousness above the conceptual, then the AI will ALWAYS be on
<br>
the same level as us, and only differ in scale and speed. Sure you can say
<br>
they MIGHT develop something new, but that's speculation and not based on
<br>
fact.
<br>
If its this easy to draw lines about consciousness (except for the chimps),
<br>
I'm sure an AI would have NO problem developing a system of classification
<br>
as such. It would be hard pressed to draw lines based on processing speed
<br>
and memory though. Is the AI going to say to the less intelligent AI,
<br>
sorry... you don't classify as intelligent just cause your running Pentium
<br>
3s and I'm using Pentium 4s? And I'm not going to try and sidestep dealing
<br>
with the issues by saying 'Well, I'm not an AI so I cant make any
<br>
intelligent predictions on what an AI might do', sure ya can. Remember,
<br>
conception is the top of the food chain, unless someone has PROOF otherwise.
