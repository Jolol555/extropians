<em>&gt;&gt; I apologize if my defense of Joe sounded like I was accusing Mike.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That was not my intent, but I agree that my words sounded like an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; accusation against Mike.  I wish I had been more clear.  I was merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; trying to prove that Joe did not start the thread by showing Mike's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; previous post.  I did not mean to therefore pin the blame on Mike.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would have and should have done much further research into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; history of the thread before blaming Mike.  I do not know that Mike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; was the first poster of the duel thread, and that was not the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; point of my post.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In my mind, there should be no blame at all.  I therefore stupidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; missed the obvious connotation of what I said.  It was not my intent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to blame Mike for anything.  I do not believe he did anything wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and he is only involved in this thread because of my ill-chosen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; words.  I wish I had been clearer in defending all participants in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the thread, and not just the first victim of the blame-game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As my first post after getting back to work from a super-flu, I'd like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to accept Harvey's apology, and I appreciate his thoroughness as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If, as I catch up on my email I see a similar one from Joe, I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;similarly accept it as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; No offense has been committed here.  The g-word is not a banned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; topic.  It can and has been discussed rationally on this list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Anyone is free to mention it in passing or discuss extropian issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that might include guns.  If it develops into a flame war, it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fault of the participants who are fighting.  We cannot blame an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; entire thread one one person or one side of an argument.  It takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; two sides to have a war.  The whole search for blame is unnecessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and unfair to all people accused.  The blame-game itself becomes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; witch-hunt where no original offense occurred.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thank you Harvey. I try to make an effort to not initiate any gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commentary, preferring to direct those to exi-freedom and save my posts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here for other subjects, however I have had to deal with the extensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accusations and misrepresentations of Joe about myself, others here, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;various gun topics/facts, and his continued claims that this topic is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not welcome on the Extropians list, IMHO shouldn't go unanswered lest he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;redefine the list be Goebellian means. If he has since recanted his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;position on that matter in the interim, I accept his apologies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Mr. Lorrey should be told that the topic has INDEED been relegated, by Max More, in his absence, to EXI-freedom.  If he obstinately continues to post on it in violation of this decision, he will be expelled from the list, if Max is as good as his word.
