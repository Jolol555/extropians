<p>Gee, thanks. I wasn't making trying to make that point.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Don't believe pseudo-philosophers (particularly collectivist ones)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who will have you think so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See for instance Henry Hazlitt's &quot;Foundations of Morality&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         <a href="http://www.hazlitt.org/e-texts/morality/">http://www.hazlitt.org/e-texts/morality/</a>
</em><br>
<p>I'm not really prone to belief. Thanks for the link, though.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; --not from any altruistic sense, but from a practical one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What does &quot;altruistic sense&quot; mean? How does it oppose practicality?
</em><br>
<p>I was speaking metaphorically here, but I guess I was simply trying to make it
<br>
clear that my perspective was based on practical considerations, not altruism. I
<br>
wasn't attempting to place them in opposition.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You're resorting to false dilemmas between choices that are not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutually exclusive.
</em><br>
<p>See above.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Well put! It's long been my contention that where natural selection ends,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; artifical selection begins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet another false dilemma.
</em><br>
<p>Again, see above. This is metaphorical language, not an assertion of scientific
<br>
fact (and you seem to have conveniently left off my parenthetical statement that
<br>
this is an oversimplification). The terms &quot;natural selection&quot; and &quot;artificial
<br>
selection&quot; have generally agreed upon meanings that have nothing to do with my
<br>
personal philosophy, and I was simply using them in a conversational way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Man is part of nature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any artificial choice is also ipso facto a natural choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you're going to oppose &quot;natural&quot; to &quot;artificial&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you must establish a believable assessment of what this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;natural choice&quot; would be in absence of humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which is of course _completely_ meaningless in any case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were human behavior is considered.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if one is calm while reading what I said, it's pretty clear I agree with
<br>
this. Again, I wasn't attempting to place anything in opposition to anything
<br>
else. This is a misreading on your part.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Intelligent agents (ourselves, for instance)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you think you're intelligent? prove it! I don't believe you, so far.
</em><br>
<p>In intelligent discussion (as opposed to unprovoked attacks), I think (damn,
<br>
there's that word again) this response would be referred to as ad hominem. It's a
<br>
weak strategy, is uncalled for in this case, and totally destroys your
<br>
credibility. Perhaps in the future you might consider taking a deep breath before
<br>
responding.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; then become responsible for their own evolution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's a shameful hysteron-proteron.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no way in which intelligence makes responsibility possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quite on the contrary, responsibility is the very principle behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural selection that made evolution possible, and that caused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence (or at least, any trace thereof that can be found)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to appear, to begin with.
</em><br>
<p>Okay. However, I wasn't making the point you seem to think I was. Perhaps you
<br>
misunderstood my use of the word responsible.  There's a difference between
<br>
&quot;responsible for&quot; (in charge of, which is what I meant) and &quot;responsible to&quot; (an
<br>
obligation).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't see how it could be anything but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;natural&quot; for us to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remove your quotes, and consider how &quot;do so&quot; is generic in your sentence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you'll have reached the tautology. Now, move on.
</em><br>
<p>This makes no sense to me. Again, I think you're arguing against something that
<br>
isn't there.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;plain vanilla natural selection&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most of the natural selection ain't vanilla.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although vanilla is indeed the product of natural selection.
</em><br>
<p>I quoted this phrase from the original post I was responding to, and was using it
<br>
in a conversational manner. I wasn't trying to make any particular point.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; A similar perspective is presented much more eloquently in the last chapter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of Wyn Wachhorst's The Dream of Spaceflight: Essays on the Near Edge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Infinity, a book I would highly recommend.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If your post was coherent with the ideas of this book, then I'd definitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disrecommend it. But I prefer to think that your recommendation is worthless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in itself, and does not taint a book that might otherwise be admirable.
</em><br>
<p>Well, now. This is way over the top and entirely unwarranted, especially since I
<br>
wasn't being argumentative or combative, and I was responding to someone else's
<br>
post, not yours. Just because the emails arrive in your mailbox, it doesn't mean
<br>
they're personal attacks on you. Relax a little. Take a walk.
<br>
<p>Personally, I don't give a damn what you think. If you don't want to read the
<br>
book I recommended, it's your loss.
