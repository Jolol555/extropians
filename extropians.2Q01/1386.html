I remember the designs for long storage life boosters for use in the asteroid belt and beyond 
<br>
being worked on by NASA (Ames?) in the late 70s-early 80s. The ones I saw all had multiple 
<br>
(5 or 7 or more) sheets of metalized mylar (not sure if it was double side plated or not, 
<br>
also not sure what the metal was) mounted with a fair amount of space between them. 
<br>
<p>These racks of sheets were placed between the tankage and the engine chamber:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(____________) | | | | | &lt;&gt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Tank--^         Reflectors Engine
<br>
<p>...looking a bit like the radiator fins on the barrel of a Tommy gun, 
<br>
but all fins having equal diameter.
<br>
<p>The fuel of choice was typically methane liquid or slush. 
<br>
Much easier to store than H2, less embrittlement risk, etc.
<br>
I seem to recall at least one design that used fluorine for the oxidizer.
<br>
<p>IIRC, the standard orientation for minimum boiloff was with the engine bell 
<br>
and reflector stack facing sunward.
<br>
<p>There is a difference in using multiple, separated reflectors. 
<br>
The result is easily computed to be superior to a single similar mirror layer on the tank, 
<br>
especially because the layer that gets the lion's share of insolation has the hardest time 
<br>
conducting to the tankage, and has an easy time radiating (as does the last sheet in the stack). 
<br>
<p>Yes, the layers would radiate to one another, reducing the effectiveness, but let's pluck some 
<br>
figures from the air: say the first layer does a .5 job, and the others only do a .7 job each:
<br>
(.5)(.7)^6 is getting pretty good, around 5%. And I bet the numbers are better than that.
<br>
<p>I'd think this would be covered in any good cryo engineering book with a chapter on dewar design.
<br>
<p>Moral: Hypothesize some super reflecting material if you want, but look at what others have done, too.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt; Suppose you have a solar sail that you wish to return to earth for

<em>&gt; &gt; hydrogen.  If you fold the sail and place it between the tank and

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it need not do.  It could be supported by a spindly rod, a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like a lady's parasol.  spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spike, I will grant you that you can reflect back &quot;much&quot; of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visible light (99% perhaps).  But I am moderately sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IR reflectance for most materials is much lower than visible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflectance.  (For example silver is the best reflector in V,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I think gold becomes better in IR.  But I think even gold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loses its effectiveness rapidly as you go into the mid-&gt;far IR.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There isn't any difference between sticking the solar sail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the Sun and the H2 tank and mirroring the outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the tank.  The solar sail will absorb IR and re-radiate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it as a black body thereby exposing the H2 tank to that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heat radiation.  *If* you can coat the H2 tank with a several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred-to-thousand atom thickness dielectric that *can* reflect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; VIS &amp; IR, then the solar sail is irrelevant.  If you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the solar sail doesn't help the problem much.  If all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are going to reflect back is the visible, you might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well simply mirror the tank itself.  The coating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the H2 tank is always going to be much thinner than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the thickness required for structural integrity, so its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really a point not worth considering (at least from a mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standpoint).
