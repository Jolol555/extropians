IN connection with Reversible Computation and Experience, Hal
<br>
Finney mentions a post of his from Sept. 1997
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q97/3600.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q97/3600.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>in which he examines the issue of memory retention versus
<br>
experience.  Actually, that's how *I* would summarize it.
<br>
Here is what he really said:
<br>
<p>&quot;You could envision a neural simulation on a Time Warp machine. It
<br>
would
<br>
assume some default pattern of incoming impulses into the part of
<br>
the
<br>
brain being simulated by some processor. Then, if the actual data
<br>
which
<br>
arrived was different from what had been assumed, it would roll back
<br>
its
<br>
state and handle the data as needed. If it turned out that the
<br>
default
<br>
model for incoming data was reasonable accurate much of the time,
<br>
this
<br>
could be a very efficient way to simulate the brain on a network.
<br>
<p>&quot;The interesting question this raises is whether there would be
<br>
any
<br>
conscious perception by the simulated brain of the &quot;paths not
<br>
taken&quot;.
<br>
Frequently, part of the brain moves forward in time assuming
<br>
some
<br>
pattern of outside impulses, only to find out that the actual
<br>
pattern
<br>
was different from what was assumed, so that it resets its state to
<br>
what
<br>
it was in the past and proceeds forward to process the actual data.
<br>
So
<br>
there are transient brain states being computed which do not
<br>
correspond
<br>
to the actual brain states which the simulation eventually
<br>
produces.
<br>
<p>&quot;We assume that the (simulated) neural activity is what gives rise
<br>
to
<br>
consciousness. Therefore it might be that the simulated &quot;wrong&quot;
<br>
neural
<br>
activity could give rise to a consciousness which does not match
<br>
the
<br>
&quot;true&quot; consciousness being determined by the simulation. This
<br>
false
<br>
consciousness would have no way of interacting with the outside
<br>
world, or
<br>
of revealing its existence through any overt behavior. The person
<br>
being
<br>
simulated would steadfastly deny that he had any unusual
<br>
perceptions
<br>
or sensations due to the time warp simulation (because all the
<br>
false
<br>
ones would get rolled back and erased). Yet we have reason to
<br>
think
<br>
that he is wrong, by the principle which identifies mental states
<br>
with
<br>
(simulated) brain states.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;This could be thought of as a case where behavior cannot reveal
<br>
certain
<br>
mental attributes.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>I think that's exactly correct.  To me it's also an illustration
<br>
of the difference between memory acquisition and experience.  One
<br>
can today have the latter without the former: sleeping pills
<br>
containing midazolam prevent short-term memory from becoming
<br>
permanent).  In Hal's case, the duration of each piece of
<br>
experience is so brief that the experiencer cannot even begin
<br>
to articulate his or her experience.
<br>
<p>I stress the primacy of experience, and not the memories of it that
<br>
I carry into the indefinite future.  Though obviously important,
<br>
memories might be artificial, whereas experience, by definition,
<br>
is always genuine.
<br>
<p>But Hal's post has a disturbing implication.  His description of
<br>
a time-warp brain isn't so different from what we now know about
<br>
real brains!  Certain experiments indicate that your brain does
<br>
take several paths at once, and you only remember the &quot;winner&quot;.
<br>
I recall an experiment in which they somehow got the subject to
<br>
to reliably specify the point at which a certain image or idea
<br>
occurred to him.  The trouble was, that by this time the
<br>
information that the subject had received was still ambiguous.
<br>
(For example, the subject might have heard either &quot;bear&quot; or &quot;bare&quot;
<br>
and couldn't yet have formed the proper image.)  Evidently, memories
<br>
of the &quot;other paths&quot; were discarded by the brain.
<br>
<p>So if I stick to my guns here, the implication is that I may be
<br>
conscious (in the long run) of only a small part of my experience.
<br>
Very confusing conclusion!
<br>
