<em>&gt;From: &quot;Bill Douglass&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:douglassbill@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Made%20in%20China&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104192106.OAA29062@well.com&gt;">douglassbill@hotmail.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I've been to mainland China around eight times myself, and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had candid discussions with numerous individuals, on politics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economics and other subjects.  Not once has anyone even hinted at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a wish for foreigners to stop buying Chinese products as a way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pressuring their government to treat its people better.  On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contrary, Chinese people I've spoken with are quite pleased with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the progress their country has made over the past two decades, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and they're well aware that the main spur for this progress has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been their government's economic reforms, first implemented by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Deng Xiaoping.
</em><br>
<p>I am not buying Chinese products to express the outrage I feel at
<br>
the way Americans were treated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If enough Americans were to decide to stop buying Chinese goods,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the effect would be the same as if a protectionist like Pat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Buchanan were to become President, and equally tragic: it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cut off the flow of oxygen to China's economy.
</em><br>
<p>I'd suggest they start taking deep breaths....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However, in times of economic stagnation or crisis with the West
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(such as the aftermath of the embassy bombing in Belgrade, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example, not to mention the current problems in Hainan Province)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the anti-progress Communist hardliners in government tend to gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ground, and criticism of the liberals becomes louder.
</em><br>
<p>The government can lie to it's own people all it want's, the
<br>
message that people feel wronged will get through.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's always hard to predict the future, but as far as I can tell,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the effects of a large-scale boycott of Chinese-made goods would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have the primary effect of slowing or even reversing the liberal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pro-freedom trend in China (there would be other negative effects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but again, I'm keeping this relevant to the thread).
</em><br>
<p>Or the people responsible for this incident will pay the price. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I buy Chinese-made goods all the time and have absolutely no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;qualms about doing so.
</em><br>
<p>Bill, that's your own choice. As for me, I'm reminded of Frank
<br>
Herbert's Bene Gesserit and the message they used to send to those
<br>
who had &quot;annoyed&quot; them.
<br>
<p>You (China) will pay.
