<em>&gt; That's one I haven't heard.  I suspect you would've been hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressed to find a white northerner of any stripe who wanted to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a migration of blacks into the north.  Most had no intention of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the previous half-century or so in northern states.
</em><br>
<p>There was already migration of blacks to the north well underway prior
<br>
to the Fugitive Slave Act. While free blacks were treated as poorly as
<br>
Irish and Italian immigrants at the time, the northern upper class had
<br>
no trouble employing them, their problem was in socialising with them.
<br>
The FSA stripped the north of free blacks, either by forcing them into
<br>
Canada or else shipping them back south, which led to a labor shortage
<br>
in the north. Not so much that an uptick in immigration wouldn't fix it
<br>
(and French Canadian immigration did pick up at this time), but enough
<br>
to teach northern industrialists the value of cheap minority labor. 
<br>
<p>Of course, fighting a war over labor supply is a crass and unhonorable
<br>
thing to do. It obviously needed to be prettied up to be sensitive to
<br>
their sensitive Brahmin/Quaker noses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The north's reasons for waging war to prevent secession include
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mostly bad ones (as &quot;paloeolibertarians&quot; love to point out, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd be hard pressed to name a war not fought mostly for bad reasons),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though the south's primary reason for firing the first shots was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple: preserve slavery.  Read the letters and oratory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pro-secession southern politicians as the campaign for secession
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was under way: the arguments are all about protecting huge investments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in slaves, protecting women and children from supposedly barbaric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Africans, and protecting the southern economy and way of life,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which they believed, or argued anyway, could not exist without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slavery.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the reason the south seceded in 1861?  They lost control of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the federal government, which they had a lock on for nearly all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the nation's short history up to that point. VERY quickly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pro-slavery southerners switched from using arguments for federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power to enforce slavery to using state's rights arguments to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintain slavery.  Most unfortunate, as mostly-meritorious arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for devolution of power are now tarred with racism in the US.
</em><br>
<p>Funny how that is, while states rights arguments against the Fugitive
<br>
Slave Act are ignored because it offends the Democrat agenda.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a review of some recent books on these topics.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; * Affirmative action and &quot;multiculturalism&quot; are undermining western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;   civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Which I agree with entirely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm no fan of AA and perhaps not of multicultralism depending upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how it's defined, though I'd say western civilization is much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resilient than to be threatened by giving special privileges to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small minorities.  After all it survived for almost its entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history giving special privileges to roughly half the population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (men) and expositing racial theories at least as bogus and destructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as today's most virulent &quot;multiculturalist&quot;, so defined as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include such people.
</em><br>
<p>That depends on your opinions of those who received special priviledges.
<br>
Tis a pity that a woman's sole sense of honor revolved around her
<br>
virginity, perhaps they'd generally be far better citizens if they were
<br>
included under US Code Title X from the moment women's sufferage was
<br>
enacted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; For reasons I do not understand paleos fawn over wholly inconsistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; cultural conservatives, curmudgeonly kooks, and Pat Buchanan while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; castigating mere economic conservatives and culturally liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; libertarians as handmaidens of the fall, more or less.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, I don't fawn over any cultural conservative, or kooks, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; despise Pat Buchanan. So you need to come up with another theory...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't find any record of you calling yourself a paleolibertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either.
</em><br>
<p>I am a libertarian, and I have been called a neanderthal before, so I
<br>
assumed that it was implied.
