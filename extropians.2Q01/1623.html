</em><br>
<p>We need a working term for a 'potential' consciousness (this is kind of
<br>
the logical complement of a zombie).  I.e. an informatic state, that if
<br>
'runs' on a computer that is designed to execute that &quot;bit collection&quot;
<br>
that when executed results is a &quot;consciousness&quot;.  This is perhaps similar
<br>
to the 'potential' human that exists in a developing embryo or fetus.
<br>
(It is not yet self aware, but has the potential to become so given
<br>
sufficient resources that are not normally under its control.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I still don't buy -- myself -- the argument that the consciousness or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not of an entity relies entirely on their internal representation; that is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether they react according to a lookup table, or according to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystical other.
</em><br>
<p>I think 'consciousness' is a combination of things, not the least of which
<br>
include:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The ability to &quot;grab onto&quot; the behavioral (director) bit-stream;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The ability to create a sim into which the bit-stream is redirected;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The ability to view yourself as the 'actor' in the sim;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The ability to run the sim forward into future time with reasonable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accuracy;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The ability to evaluate the results of the sim;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The ability to choose to execute or not execute the sim in 'reality'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This mini-sim, how is it built? What does it do?
</em><br>
<p>You have to read William Calvin on this.  He explains it far better
<br>
than I can.  It essentially involves the development of an internal
<br>
recreation of what needs to be done to manifest something in reality.
<br>
(Imagining throwing a ball, &quot;dreaming&quot; about what you want to do, etc.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What tells you that it cannot be equivalent to some sort of 'lookup table';
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to some sort of function mapping the input (that is output from the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function) to some sort of output (the desirability rating)?
</em><br>
<p>Once you have run the mini-sim, I'm sure the 'evaluation' of the
<br>
results probably does involve some kind of lookup in your experience
<br>
table to grade the result.  Imagine 'proposing' marriage to a woman
<br>
(or for the woman, imagine being 'proposed to').  How do you decide
<br>
the 'merit' of the quality of the proposal or the answer?  It isn't
<br>
like most of us have dozens of experiences under these conditions.
<br>
<p>On the other hand we do have dozens of experiences crossing the
<br>
street and evaluate our risk of being hit by a car with an estimate
<br>
of the distance, vehicle velocity, our rate of crossing the street,
<br>
etc.  The lookup table approach works fine for many behaviors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It still seems to be two functions; that are composed in order to form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'consciousness' according to you -- so what says that this composite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function isn't conscious in itself?
</em><br>
<p>I would agree that 'consciousness' is a combination of the lookup-tables
<br>
and the evaluation of the results of the tables.  The process of
<br>
developing 'consciousness', is perhaps the primary thing that babies
<br>
learn.  They must accumulate a lot of information of what works and what
<br>
doesn't and develop the ability to use it.  However the information
<br>
&quot;itself&quot; does not provide consciousness.  Minimal consciousness probably
<br>
requires an (a), (b) and (e) above; then (f) develops; and finally
<br>
one gains sufficient experience for (d) to work reliably and if
<br>
one is moderately enlightened (c) begins to play a role.
<br>
<p>Good points though, I wouldn't have broken it down like I
<br>
do above, if you hadn't asked the questions.
<br>
