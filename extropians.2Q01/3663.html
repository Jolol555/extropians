connection to

</em><br>
<p>Yes, a lot of people are in chat mode.  But suppose that someone has
<br>
put in a long day creating wealth, and wants a bit of fun and stimulation.
<br>
As has been said, one of the purpose of a list like this is to create a
<br>
party atmosphere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I read the daily digest, I am forced to think about what I read, wonder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about responding, then ten minutes further on in my reading, find that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several people have responded far better than I could have hoped to respond.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, your complaint echos the way that I feel, in that that for
<br>
your purposes and mine, the list would be a lot richer if people
<br>
didn't respond instantly and impulsively, but judiciously weighed
<br>
the whole thing up for a while, perhaps reading some other comments
<br>
first.  While this would greatly increase the value of the list for
<br>
some of us, it would destroy its utility for those who need the
<br>
party-type conversational atmosphere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, please count to ten before responding - and never send the first draft!
</em><br>
<p>'fraid that's going to be asking too much of most folks.
<br>
<p>As for me, I'm having to give up on digest mode: it's just too hard
<br>
to wade through all the junk and get to the meat.  In individual
<br>
mode, at least I can start ignoring the posts of people's who I've
<br>
learned contribute very little, or who've for the nonce lost their
<br>
tempers.
<br>
