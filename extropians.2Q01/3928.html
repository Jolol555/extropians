I rode into downtown San Jose to make a sushi map, or
<br>
scope out some places and note when they close, so that
<br>
if anyone wants to go on foot after the meetings Friday
<br>
or Saturday, they could use that as a reference.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately...  I forgot what day it is.
<br>
<p>This weekend is not only a major Latin holiday, it was the first
<br>
really nice warm summery weekend we have had this year,
<br>
and there were approximately 8 trillion people down there
<br>
Cinco de Mayo-ing, low riders cruising, senioritas in their
<br>
little outfits, parading themselves shamelessly up and down
<br>
the sidewalks, cars parked bumper to bumper along the street.
<br>
Blocking my view.  }8-[     {8^D
<br>
<p>Ill try again next weekend on the sushi map, and perhaps
<br>
I will not take the motorcycle this time.
<br>
<p>The San Jose Hilton was an *excellent* choice of places
<br>
to have E5.  There is loooots of stuff to do right around there
<br>
within walking distance and it is a nice safe area of town,
<br>
close to the Tech museum, lots of interesting eateries and
<br>
such.  This is gonna be fun!   spike
