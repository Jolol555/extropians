[This op/ed piece is more clear about rejecting technological progress per se

<p>OPENING SHOTS
<br>
<p>In his book Remaking Eden, Princeton University molecular biologist Lee
<br>
Silver wonders what the future might look like when the world gets over its
<br>
nervousness about human genetic engineering. Like many science fiction
<br>
writers who have speculated about the social implications of the technology,
<br>
Prof. Silver predicts it will encourage the ancient human impulse to divide
<br>
society into classes. The genetically enhanced-&quot;GenRich,&quot; he calls them-will
<br>
be smarter, stronger and wealthier than the &quot;Naturals.&quot; Eventually they will
<br>
recognize each other as separate species, and develop a relationship similar
<br>
to that which exists between humans and apes today.
<br>
<p>It is tempting to discount such ideas as mere fodder for the next Planet of
<br>
the Apes sequel, except the technology is not just speculative, it's real.
<br>
The only thing standing in the way of an elemental redesign of the human
<br>
species is our old moral and ethical qualms. And every day brings more
<br>
evidence that we are succumbing to the seductive power of perfectionism, the
<br>
omnipotent philosophy of our era.
<br>
<p>The Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) is an organization
<br>
created by the federal government in 1998 and endowed this year with $360
<br>
million in public money to fund research aimed at keeping Canada competitive
<br>
in the global healthcare industry. On March 28 it released the report and
<br>
recommendations of a CIHR working group which spent the last several months
<br>
examining the latest scientific, legal and ethical developments related to
<br>
human stem cell research.
<br>
<p>Stem cells are the closest thing yet to the fountain of youth. They are
<br>
uniquely capable of either reproducing themselves or developing into other,
<br>
specialized types of cells. Scientists believe they potentially hold the
<br>
power to regenerate blood, tissue, bones and organs. They are present in all
<br>
animals at all stages of development, including adulthood, but as with
<br>
almost every form of human biotech promising perfection, there's an ethical
<br>
catch: many scientists say that stem cells with the greatest regenerative
<br>
capacity are only found in the embryonic stage of development.
<br>
<p>It is important to differentiate here between stem cell and fetal cell
<br>
research, which Celeste McGovern examined in chilling detail in the last
<br>
edition of this magazine. Though the science is comparable (and the ethics
<br>
just as murky), embryonic stem cells are &quot;pluripotent,&quot; or endowed with the
<br>
capacity to develop into a wide range of other cells. Researchers believe
<br>
stem cells could be used to counter the effects of degenerative diseases
<br>
such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and arthritis, rebuild bones, cartilage and
<br>
the spinal cord, and regenerate internal organs, thus substituting for
<br>
transplantation. At the earliest stages of development, some stem cells may
<br>
be &quot;totipotent,&quot; which means they could be used to create an entire
<br>
organism. Stem cells are typically harvested from embryos less than 14 days
<br>
old.
<br>
<p>Fetal cells are obtained from specific tissues taken from more mature
<br>
aborted fetuses. In their most notorious application, they have been taken
<br>
from the brains of aborted babies and injected into the brains of
<br>
Parkinson's sufferers. The results of these experiments have been ambiguous
<br>
and, as Ms. McGovern reported, occasionally nightmarish.
<br>
<p>In our relativistic age, most people detect an ethical difference between
<br>
material taken from a microscopic ball of embryonic cells and brain cells
<br>
sucked from the skull of an aborted fetus. The authors of the CIHR stem cell
<br>
report recognize that the devolution of ethical standards is an incremental
<br>
business and position their recommendations accordingly. They urge expansion
<br>
and public funding of stem cell research, but with several conditions
<br>
attached. Stem cells are only to be obtained from discarded embryos at
<br>
fertility clinics, and only with their &quot;parents&quot; consent. No one should
<br>
create embryos in vitro specifically for stem cell experimentation. Nor
<br>
should stem cells be used to create or contribute to human embryos. And
<br>
there should be no transgenic experimentation involving human stem cells and
<br>
animal embryos, or vice versa.
<br>
<p>It is hard to see the ethical distinction between experiments on &quot;discarded&quot;
<br>
embryos and embryos concocted in a test tube specifically for research. The
<br>
CIHR report stickhandles around the question by noting that some people
<br>
think all embryos are potential persons and thus deserving of protection,
<br>
while others with spare embryos sitting in a fertility clinic freezer might
<br>
wish to donate some of them to medical research. The implied difference
<br>
relates to ownership: the fate of the embryo is in the hands of the people
<br>
who supplied the egg and sperm. But this is an eminently bendable rule. If
<br>
some civic- minded souls choose to donate eggs and sperm to a lab, surely
<br>
ownership passes to the clinic, or some NASDAQ-traded biotech firm that
<br>
sells stem cells for US$5,000 per cluster. (That is the reported price two
<br>
Canadian researchers paid an American stem cell supplier last year.)
<br>
<p>The authors of the CIHR report say they hope their recommendations will
<br>
spark a rational public debate which ultimately leads to the creation of a
<br>
formal regulatory framework so that scientists know what they can or cannot
<br>
do in the field of stem cell research. Today they are working in a
<br>
regulatory void, much like fetal cell researchers, genetic engineers and the
<br>
shadowy characters experimenting with clones.
<br>
<p>The demand for regulation has been around since the 1993 release of the
<br>
report of the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies. So far the
<br>
federal Liberals have done nothing, which is to be expected from a
<br>
government that regards any manifestation of moral certainty with a mixture
<br>
of fear and contempt, but as governments elsewhere begin to either licence
<br>
or prohibit the various technologies, even the Grits will soon follow suit.
<br>
Thus it is a good time to point out, as loudly and often as possible, that
<br>
all of this stuff ultimately raises the same ethical dilemma: we are
<br>
cannibalizing ourselves in our desire for perfection and immortality. It
<br>
began with blood transfusions, moved to transplants and test-tube babies,
<br>
and after stem cell and fetal tissue treatments there will be clones. If we
<br>
don't soon get off the treadmill we may well become perfect-and therefore
<br>
inhuman.
