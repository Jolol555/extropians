<p>Attempts to predict the future of technology are usually only successful on a 
<br>
short term basis.  AI, uploading, ubiquitous nanotech, etc. are so far in the 
<br>
future that no one can accurately predict what will be feasible and what will 
<br>
not.  We know there will be nanotech, but what will it's limitations be?  
<br>
There WILL be some.  Nanotech is not magic.  And AI.......well that could be 
<br>
a century away or more and even then who knows?  Genetics is tried and proven 
<br>
and a path that any tranhumanist currently alive will have to take.  No one 
<br>
has ever come close to anything like an AI or uploading.  The number of 
<br>
pitfalls are horrendous.  I am not saying that eventually these will not come 
<br>
about but I feel that for myself, and anyone remotely my age,  that their 
<br>
best bet for a continued existence is through genetics.  I won't even get 
<br>
into the sociology of people turning themselves into robots.  I myself like 
<br>
being human.  What would you be without your humanity?  Something more?  
<br>
Maybe,  but then again maybe you'll end up a lonely lost set of data in a 
<br>
make believe world that some AI programmed.  What is the point in that?
