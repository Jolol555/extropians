<p>
It is indeed hard to grasp the mind-set of people who support this bill.
<br>
<p>This sort of thing serves as a reminder that what we take as obvious, the
<br>
majority of people think is ~really far out there~.
<br>
<p>We sit around wondering why no one will take the notion of a Singularity
<br>
seriously.  Well, how could people who think human cloning is &gt;&gt;evil&lt;&lt; in
<br>
some mysterious sense, ever take seriously a notion like transhuman AI's
<br>
helping us to transcend ourselves?
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems many people are raised with default ideologies which
<br>
keep them from taking notions like this seriously.
<br>
<p>And so the majority of humanity will stumble into the future blindly,
<br>
unwilling to open their minds to the new facts unfolding, and being created
<br>
by others, all around them...
<br>
<p>What do we need to do to wake people up?
<br>
<p>Oh, why bother.
<br>
<p>Just keep building the technology, and people will come around after the
<br>
fact instead of in advance, like they always do....
<br>
<p>We should all move to countries where advanced technology is legal, and then
<br>
these will become the richest countries, and the fools in charge of nations
<br>
like the US will slowly see the absurdity of their ways...

<em>&gt; UGHHHH!!!! THIS MAKES ME SO ANGRY!!!! What can we do to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them from passing this unbelieveably BACKWARDS bill??? To me, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just goes to show how very uneducated our politicians are on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits of scientific work that could benefit millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people. OK, what is going to happen if the Raelians actually do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manage to make some viable clones? Will this change anything?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will it make our government realize that there is a need for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to happen? It's like they are trying to put the emergency brakes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a train that will not stop. OK so the USA doesn't do cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now.. what happens to us when the rest of the world starts to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (OHH BOY if China was doing it now??? LOL)? Sounds like we would

<em>&gt; &gt; Subject: US lawmakers introduce bill to ban all forms of human cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;                      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    WASHINGTON, April 26 (AFP) - US lawmakers on Thursday introduced  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a bill to ban all forms of human cloning including &quot;therapeutic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cloning&quot; used in embryonic stem cell research.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    The Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 goes one step further  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than legislation introduced earlier this month by a senator that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would ban &quot;reproductive cloning,&quot; or allowing the birth of a cloned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    &quot;Efforts to create human beings by cloning mark a new and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decisive step toward turning human reproduction into a manufacturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process,&quot; said Kansas Senator Sam Brownback in introducing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; measure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    As for cloning to develop stem cells, Brownback said the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prospect of &quot;creating new human life solely to be exploited and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destroyed in this way has been condemned on moral grounds by many as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; displaying a profound disrespect for human life.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    The bill, backed by Representative Dave Weldon of Florida, would  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make human cloning a federal criminal offense punishable by up to 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; years imprisonment and a fine of not less than one million dollars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    The measure would include a ban on the importation of cloned  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; products.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    Both lawmakers argued that stem research could continue using  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stem cells from adult tissues, placentas and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    &quot;Other scientific research, using cloning techniques to produce  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; molecules, DNA, cells other than human embryos, tissues, organs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plants, or animals other than humans, is explicitly permitted,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explained a fact sheet on the bill produced by the National
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Conference of Catholic Bishops.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    Weldon and Brownback said they felt the bill had a good chance  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of passing both the House and Senate, pointing out that a recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Time/CNN poll showed 90 percent of Americans said it was &quot;a bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; idea&quot; to clone human beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    If approved, the bill would then go to President George W. Bush,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who has come out against human cloning, to be signed into law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    On April 5, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell introduced a bill  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that would ban human cloning and urged members the House of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Representatives to follow suit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    His proposal would ban all attempts to clone a human being  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; regardless of whether this effort is financed with government or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; private funds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    In 1997, the administration of former president Bill Clinton  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; declared a five-year moratorium on human cloning financed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government funds, but at the moment, nothing prevents a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; privately-financed experiment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    Previous attempts to pass legislation banning human cloning have  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been unsuccessful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    Proponents of human cloning include Panos Zavos, a naturalized  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; American and  former professor of reproductive psychology at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; University of Kentucky who is a member of a private consortium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; working on human cloning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    In addition, Clonaid, a firm founded by the Raelians, a  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religious sect, has announced plans to clone a 10-month-old dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; baby.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        
</em><br>
