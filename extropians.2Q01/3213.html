<em>&gt; Do you see a difference? The more recent times spend a lot of time shooting

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I support ExI, and it would be pretty sad to get a lot of press/interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the upcoming Extro-5 only to have anyone who looks at the list then to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a complete mess. So I'm making some small effort here to provide some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback before that event. There is also an upcoming improvement to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list: the Javien reputation/ranking system. However since this is voluntary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not sure if it will help much. The kinds of people I am railing against
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Thanks for clarifying your point. This is much more useful than your original post.
<br>
And while I agree with you in a general sense, I still feel that that first post
<br>
was too hostile and made you sound like some sort of crank. If you don't want to be
<br>
lumped in with the people you're railing against, whining and calling them names
<br>
won't cut it. For public relations purposes, the high road always looks better
<br>
(IMHO).
