Ok, because this discussion is too good to miss, I have
<br>
resubscribed to the list (but if my mailbox starts
<br>
filling up with mortar shells, I'm going to figure
<br>
out how to filter that stuff out and invoice the parties
<br>
involved for my time!)

<p>Hal said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This points to a problem with the idea of a simulation that covers only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a limited period of time: how to initialize the characters who must 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitably be partway through their lives at the time the simulation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begins. This is especially difficult if the characters are not zombies. 
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  We are entering the period in time when those of us who want
<br>
to be will be mentally &quot;on the net&quot; via a fiber interconnect will
<br>
be able to do so.  I've done the calculations on this and using
<br>
wavelength division multiplexing and a few thousand fibers, you can
<br>
definitely &quot;tap&quot; the brain at its full internal bandwidth.  So once
<br>
this happens there is virtually no problem recreating such individuals
<br>
partway through their lives.  Its the equivalent in database operations
<br>
of executing a &quot;ROLLBACK&quot; command.  The only problem you potentially
<br>
have is the granularity of time resolution that you want to be able
<br>
to &quot;ROLLBACK&quot; to.  But with 10^40+ bits at your disposal and the
<br>
fact that you only really need to save the &quot;difference&quot; information
<br>
between the ROLLBACK states (read: you can compress the ROLLBACK
<br>
data a *lot*) I suspect there are a huge number of states that you
<br>
will be able to start the simulation at.
<br>
<p>Now, rolling back to a pre-Matrix state is going to be a bit trickier.
<br>
I suspect its going to take a detailed understanding of how the
<br>
brain really works, a reasonable approximation of the genetic code
<br>
for the individuals involved and probably a fair amount of hypothetical
<br>
&quot;back-tracking&quot; simulations.  Since you know the historical reality
<br>
to some accuracy, you have to backtrack from the current reality
<br>
all the way through to the historic reality, then allow it to run
<br>
forward to see if you get back to the current reality.  If you do then
<br>
one assumes your recreation of the historical state was accurate enough.
<br>
You run into problems due to chaos theory.  You probably need to
<br>
allow it to run forward multiple times, if you end up in your
<br>
current state 99 times out of 100 then your past recreation is
<br>
&quot;good enough&quot;.  I expect it will be a very interesting branch
<br>
of science and mathematics to determine whether there are multiple
<br>
initial historical states that lead to the present state.  That
<br>
will set some interesting limits on how &quot;accurate&quot; you need to
<br>
make the historical recreation.  [On most days, it just doesn't
<br>
matter whether I get out of bed at 7:00 or 7:01... etc.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fundamental paradox is that if the Simulators are not able to know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how humans will behave without running the simulation, then they will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be able to come up with realistic memories and histories for adults 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the start of the simulation. Or, putting it the other way, if they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are able to tell what people will be like and what they will do without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running a simulation, then they don't need to run any simulations. 
</em><br>
<p>I think more probably, you have to run enough simulations to get
<br>
the &quot;standard forms&quot; for the individuals you want to put into it.
<br>
Due to genetic and socialization constraints humans are remarkably
<br>
similar to each other (when one considers the phase space of how
<br>
they &quot;could&quot; be).  If you look at psychology you have all of the
<br>
standard ways of &quot;classifying&quot; individuals.  I suspect you could
<br>
could have lots of pull down menus on the simulator control panel
<br>
for this type of stuff, e.g.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sex: ____________
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;... Scroll down to &quot;male, normal&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: ____________
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;... Scroll down to &quot;very bright&quot;  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental Background: _________________
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;... Scroll down to  &quot;strict religious bordering on oppressive,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prototype Eliezer Yudkowsky's home&quot;
<br>
<p>etc.
