<p>&lt;&lt; Well, that's the point I was making.  Making a fuss over cryonic suspension
<br>
&nbsp;at this stage seems a little like somebody in 1710 (or whenver it was)
<br>
&nbsp;getting excited at the prospect of a train trip after hearing about
<br>
&nbsp;that early steam engine, and spending their life savings on a ticket.
<br>
&nbsp;I want to see the train that's going to take me to Missouri, before
<br>
&nbsp;I bother talking to the ticket agent.  But that's just me ;-&gt; .

Originally, I was saying that Hans Moravec believes that (at least) 
<br>
neutronium computers will be one of the ultimates, in the Age of Mind. We do 
<br>
not have a lab sample, but neutronium likely, exists, and Moravec sees 
<br>
converted Neutron stars as massive homes for equally, massive, intelligences. 
<br>
Moravec, also independently came up with some eschatological notions (sans 
<br>
Tipler's use of a collapsing Cosmos) in order to achieve the same thing, and 
<br>
save a whole bunch of energy and time in the process. Downloading seems 
<br>
desirable in many cases, but we are at the beginning of the human endeavor in 
<br>
the cognitive sciences, not toward its maturity. We will have to wait and see 
<br>
how mind/brain/personality are structured, before the Upload Express gets 
<br>
a-mov'in.
