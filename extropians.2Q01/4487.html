<p>This came up in at the Foresight SA meeting last month in the
<br>
&quot;Nanotechnology &amp; Space&quot; discussion group.  My group had the
<br>
problem of &quot;How do you enroll the greens in the development
<br>
of space?&quot;.  The conclusion we came to was that you want to
<br>
sell them the idea that we could cheaply get people off the
<br>
planet and reduce the footprint of humanity.
<br>
<p>But to be logically consistent with their position, you couldn't
<br>
have the non-greens go into space leaving the greens behind.
<br>
The greens had to go too!  So we figured that we would terraform
<br>
Venus (no natural ecology there that we know of) and let
<br>
all the greens live there and occupy a huge VR of the Earth
<br>
where all of the inputs are pseudo-real based on large numbers
<br>
of micro-cameras left on Earth.
<br>
<p>I doubt that scenario is one that is going to appeal to most
<br>
of the greens however.
