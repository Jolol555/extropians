<p>
I ran across a question-and-answer exchange with a
<br>
certain Clay Shirky at Slashdot yesterday
<br>
( <a href="http://slashdot.org/interviews/01/03/13/1420210.shtml">http://slashdot.org/interviews/01/03/13/1420210.shtml</a> ).
<br>
I had not been aware of this gentleman before, though it
<br>
seems he has been mentioned on this list (e.g., by
<br>
Max More in <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/1419.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/1419.html</a> ).
<br>
<p>He has a Web site too, with links to many of the articles
<br>
he has written for various on-line magazines, at
<br>
<a href="http://www.shirky.com">http://www.shirky.com</a> (and there's a CV of Shirky at
<br>
<a href="http://www.shirky.com/bio.html">http://www.shirky.com/bio.html</a> ).
<br>
<p>His writing style is very breezy and dryly funny; I find
<br>
his opinions both congenial and plausible, and he talks about
<br>
lots of things likely to be of interest to folks on this list,
<br>
such as Web economics (micropayments, and charging for content),
<br>
litigation and the Web, censorship and the Web, the Web as
<br>
an evolving system, and more.  Here's a sample from the Slashdot
<br>
interview:
<br>
<p>&quot;In 1993, during what I can now thankfully call the nadir of my
<br>
personal and professional life, I discovered the internet, and
<br>
essentially disappeared into it. For someone who had spent
<br>
a lot of time thinking about language and community, the net
<br>
was like a gift, having something this interesting to think about.
<br>
At a time when I was living an otherwise flattened existence, the
<br>
daily challenge of trying to understand the net gave me something
<br>
to live for.
<br>
<p>None of my friends at the time was online, so I made a second
<br>
set of friends, mainly on panix, ECHO, and alt.folklore.urban. During
<br>
those years, I essentially lived in two worlds, with the networked world
<br>
seeming realer to me than the real world. I often had a daydream in
<br>
which the hum of the internet just grazed the top of my skull; it felt as if
<br>
by standing on tip-toe I should be able to press my brain directly into
<br>
the network. Going 24 hours without jacking in made me physically ill.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>I have no trouble saying the internet saved my life, but I also have no
<br>
trouble saying that I was for a time addicted to it. (The addiction
<br>
passed like a fever. I awoke one morning a few years ago, and
<br>
*didn't need to check my email*, a craving whose absence rattled
<br>
me a bit, as getting online with the first crack of consciousness had
<br>
for years been a more reliable feature of my mornings than either
<br>
eating or getting dressed.)
<br>
<p>I was addicted to communication, to a very peculiar kind of social
<br>
congress that put a huge premium on verbal acuity while conveying
<br>
none of the emotional cues you pick up from other people when you
<br>
are in the same physical space with them. Anyone who has ever gotten
<br>
to know someone in email and later met them in the real world understands
<br>
this difference instinctively: you read someone's email differently after
<br>
you've spent some time with them offline as well.
<br>
<p>So the web can paradoxically enhance our ability to communicate *and*
<br>
further isolate us. The real danger, it seems to me, is in believing that
<br>
it can only do one or the other.&quot;
