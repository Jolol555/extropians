<p>Actually, we were assuming that the host's strategy, or set of

strategies with probability of each, was known to the contestant.  This

would be a contestant coming into the game show after carefully

reviewing lots and lots of prior episodes, and maybe also sitting in
<br>
the audience for prior ones that season, or just asking contestants in
<br>
prior shows (perhaps in exchange for a small piece of the winnings).
