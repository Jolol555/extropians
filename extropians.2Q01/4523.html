<br>
<p>COMPUTING WITH WAVES.  Conventional computers do their
<br>
jobs by using electrons as billiard-ball like particles to move
<br>
around circuits and carry out the desired tasks. At last week's
<br>
CLEO/QELS lasers/optics conference in Baltimore, a University
<br>
of Rochester group (Ian Walmsley, 716-275-0312,
<br>
<a href="mailto:walmsley@optics.rochester.edu?Subject=Re:%20New%20Light-Based%20Computer%20Runs%20At%20Quantum%20Speeds&In-Reply-To=&lt;002001c0e06a$636b3760$5a165e0c@flrjs&gt;">walmsley@optics.rochester.edu</a>) presented a simple optical system
<br>
that performs a database search of 50 items in a way that cannot be
<br>
duplicated in any particle-powered computer.  To do the search,
<br>
the researchers use wave interference, the patterns that are created
<br>
when two waves, such as light waves, combine.   While their
<br>
demonstration is not any more efficient than traditional database
<br>
searches, it is the largest search performed with wave interference.
<br>
It is a follow-up to a similar demonstration in an atom (Ahn et al.,
<br>
Science, 21 January 2000) and expands possibilities for &quot;wave
<br>
computing&quot; which would be intermediate in power between
<br>
classical computing and quantum computing.  In addition, the
<br>
Rochester group uses light, which is much easier to prepare and
<br>
transport than atoms.  In their demonstration, the researchers
<br>
produce a single pulse of light carrying a spectrum of different
<br>
colors, each containing a different bit of information.  They split
<br>
the pulse into two identical pulses each with half the intensity. One
<br>
travels to an &quot;Oracle,&quot; an optical element (an acousto-optic
<br>
modulator) which for certain colors shifts their phase, the relative
<br>
position of the peaks of the wave compared to other colors.  Then
<br>
they combine the Oracle pulse with the other, untreated pulse at a
<br>
beamsplitter, which produces two output beams, each going in
<br>
different direction. Only the components of the beam which have
<br>
their phases changed travel toward a spectrometer and detector,
<br>
enabling the researchers to read out the information and determine
<br>
the location of the desired item in the database.  (Paper QWB3;
