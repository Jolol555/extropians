<p>I don't understand these objections. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps I lack sufficient context. Devil away, but tell me what you are
<br>
envisioning?
<br>
<p>_I'm_ envisioning plug-compatible self-knowledgeable components that
<br>
function a bit like USB devices; they can communicate tuples that inform
<br>
other connected components, e.g. &quot;I'm the moment arm processor. When you
<br>
connect, tell me your relative CG and location, and if you have any
<br>
internal components I should know about.&quot; Time for another run at the
<br>
&quot;embodied object&quot;/&quot;software IC&quot; merger.
<br>
<p>I am thinking in terms of using these thing in the early phases of
<br>
prospecting and site grooming. I would think that it could eventually
<br>
lead to standard configurations that could be FAA type approved for
<br>
personal telespacefaring. Or if tech progresses fast enough, to von
<br>
Neumann adjuncts, or even drop the &quot;tele&quot;... :)  
<br>
<p>That last is a mighty big if, but indicates the kind of generality I'm
<br>
after.
<br>
<p>I keep my LEGOs from exploding by not building them in such a way that
<br>
they tend to explode. How many AMSATs have exploded? Initially, at
<br>
least, I am not talking about shipping a bunch of units up to
<br>
self-assemble. I am talking about being able to put a single spacefaring
<br>
device together that is small and made of LEGO-like standard parts.
<br>
<p>Tangentially: Have you heard about the Delta upper stage embarrassments
<br>
of a few years ago? They used to leave them parked with propellant dregs
<br>
still in the tanks. After x thousand hot/cold soak cycles, boom. _Not_
<br>
neighborly.
