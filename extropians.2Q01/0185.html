Joe Dees just said:
<br>
<em>&gt;or a hate crime.  The frothing-at-the-mouth rabid bang-bang afficianadoes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that inflict and infect this list with their enthralled dogmatic memetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;zomboidisms, and try to foist the fear that preventing kids, psychos and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;criminals from getting their hands on guns by passing required background 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;checks at gun shows and flea markets is a sinister plot by the !
</em><br>
&lt;snip long email &quot;long story short, guns bad, gun-users crazy&quot;&gt;
<br>
<p>um. dude? i really really hate to bring up criticisms of other people, i'm 
<br>
mostly silent on this list, cause i can't write especially well(plus i'm a 
<br>
college student in real life, so being a student online seems logical 
<br>
enough) but....
<br>
<p>this is nuts.
<br>
<p>i realize that your position is kind of frustrating, because there are many 
<br>
people on this list interested in, or involved with guns. but, is language 
<br>
like this neccesary? it's kinda demeaning, and frankly, unsupportable.
<br>
<p>i don't really have an opinion on gun control, but this list is generally 
<br>
quiet with occasional burst of passion and disagreement. which is fun, it 
<br>
keeps people tuning in. but do you really think the way you talk about 
<br>
people in this email is justified?
