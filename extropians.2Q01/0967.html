<p><em>&gt; I'm thinking of the oft-quoted figure that the average American watches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 8 hours of TV a day.  If you had all of your material needs met and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could hit the artificial-&quot;cocaine&quot; button to experience continual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasure, are you suggesting that there is not a significant fraction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of humanity that would *not* take that route?  One only has to look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the strategies people will adopt and the illegal things they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do to experience one or another form of &quot;pleasure&quot;.  Lower the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; barriers to that and I strongly suspect you will have a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of people jumping in the boat.
</em><br>
<p>The question is how large percentage that would stay in the
<br>
boat. Something always left out of anti-drug propaganda is the
<br>
percentage of people people who try various drugs and do not become
<br>
addicted; it is fairly high (can't remember the figures I have seen
<br>
for the moment, and for natural reasons they are just estimates
<br>
anyway). Most likely addiction requires more than just pleasure,
<br>
likely a certain vulnerability in the reward and behavior inhibition
<br>
systems (which could be caused by genetic, social or internal
<br>
factors). A certain part of the population are addiction prone and
<br>
would get stuck in the above scenario, another part of the population
<br>
(and, given the figures I saw) is likely to try it, sometimes
<br>
repeatedly, but still go on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Tragedies might be useful training for recognising complex (but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possibly common) dilemmas where the outcome is a lose-lose situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is probably survival value in observing tragedies (or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiencing them) because it teaches one what should be avoided.  
</em><br>
<p>Take Hamlet as an example. The plot describes a number of situations
<br>
(uncles ursuping power, duty getting in the way of love, too clever
<br>
plans with weak follow-ups etc) and the consequences. After seeing
<br>
Hamlet you might be less likely to remain indecisive when aware of a
<br>
crime, or you might take action in some way to avoid getting caught in
<br>
the Hamlet trap. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Nick, while I will admit that some people are complex enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivate themselves to avoid boredom and find useful things to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occupy their time.  But I question how hard even we would work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at these things if there were &quot;short-cuts&quot; we could take to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling very pleased with ourselves.
</em><br>
<p>Pleasure is a complex state. The more I study it in neuroscience,
<br>
psychology and philosophy the more complex it becomes. There is a
<br>
distinct difference between the pleasure sensation you get from an
<br>
injection of morphine and the pleasure in writing a brilliant but hard
<br>
paper. There might be some common signal systems involved, but they
<br>
are very different. I think Cszikzentmihaly pointed out something
<br>
important (something that began already with Aristotle and his concept
<br>
of eudaimonic happiness) when distinguishing between 'flow' and
<br>
entertainment. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Did I mention that one of my students implemented a kind of boredom in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his neural network agent to make it get out of loops?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They let you have students now?!?  I hope the school gave them an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informed consent agreement to sign before they got enrolled in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *that* experiment.
</em><br>
<p>Let's see, one is programming missile wayfinding with genetic
<br>
algorithms, one is doing stock index prediction with neural networks
<br>
and the above student works on a reinforcement learning agent. As you
<br>
see, soon I will both have teh funding and weaponry for my easily
<br>
bored killer robots :-)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think this is the reason why a certain propensity for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; boredom is useful. The problem is tuning it: if the buildup is too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; slow, you become obsessive, if it is too fast you jump from project to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; project.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Boy, do I ever....
</em><br>
<p>As transhumanists, one interesting issue is how to tune these settings
<br>
to work with our goals and environments.
