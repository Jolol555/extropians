<p>Heard on the Net
<br>
<p>As the Dot-Com Era Fades,
<br>
Forecasters Face Skepticism
<br>
<p>By AARON ELSTEIN
<br>
WSJ.COM
<br>
<p><p>In the summer of 1999, investment bankers needed a boost for an
<br>
online-lending start-up they were about to take public.
<br>
<p>They found it at Forrester Research Inc., which had estimated that by
<br>
2003,
<br>
online mortgages would total about $91 billion, or 10% of the total
<br>
market,
<br>
up from less than 1% in 1998. Forrester's January 1999 report was a ray
<br>
of
<br>
hope for Mortgage.com Inc.
<br>
<p>Only time will tell if Forrester's forecast about online mortgages was
<br>
accurate. But Mortgage.com is out of business, and Forrester faces
<br>
tougher
<br>
questions about the accuracy of its New Economy forecasts and a harder
<br>
sell
<br>
for its services.
<br>
<p>George Forrester Colony, founder, chairman and CEO of the Cambridge,
<br>
Mass.,
<br>
research firm, stands by his firm's forecasts, saying in time they will
<br>
&quot;prove to be conservative.&quot;
<br>
<p>But others have started second-guessing such firms as Forrester, Jupiter
<br>
Media Metrix Inc., and International Data Corp., saying they provided
<br>
some
<br>
of the hot air for the Internet bubble. &quot;There's no question that
<br>
Forrester, Jupiter and, I suppose, to some extent ourselves made
<br>
forecasts
<br>
that were inflated and led people down a garden path that wasn't real,
<br>
in
<br>
retrospect,&quot; says Dale Kutnick, chairman and CEO of Meta Group Inc., a
<br>
Stamford, Conn., technology research firm.

<br>
<p>John Mahoney, an analyst who follows Forrester's stock at Raymond James
<br>
&amp;
<br>
Associates, a St. Petersburg, Fla., investment bank, agrees. &quot;Forrester
<br>
did
<br>
a lot to fuel the hype over Internet stocks,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, I see
<br>
cracks
<br>
in their armor.&quot;
<br>
<p>Times are clearly tougher for New Economy prognosticators. Earlier this
<br>
month Meta Group said the president and CEO of its Metagroup.com unit
<br>
would
<br>
resign and the company would lay off 15% of its work force, or 100
<br>
employees.
<br>
<p>Last month Jupiter Media Metrix said its CEO would step aside. In
<br>
January,
<br>
the company said it would cut 8% of its work force amid a slowdown in
<br>
spending by dot-coms and other technology companies. Jupiter Chairman
<br>
Tod
<br>
Johnson says the company is entering a &quot;more mature&quot; phase. A spokesman
<br>
for
<br>
IDC declines to comment.
<br>
<p>&quot;Ours is a new industry, and we've all enjoyed a period where our
<br>
clients'
<br>
budgets were ever-increasing,&quot; says Julio Gomez, CEO of Internet
<br>
market-researcher Gomez Inc. and a former Forrester analyst. &quot;We are all
<br>
now being tested.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr. Colony, the Forrester CEO, acknowledges that the climate has grown
<br>
&quot;much more challenging&quot; than it was a year ago. &quot;A year ago, probably
<br>
30%
<br>
to 40% of our clients were looking for justifications about why they
<br>
should
<br>
buy our research,&quot; he says. &quot;Now it's probably 70% to 75%.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nonetheless, Mr. Colony says, Forrester can benefit from its rivals'
<br>
difficulties. &quot;We feel we can gain market share this year,&quot; he says,
<br>
adding
<br>
that the company hasn't revised the guidance it offered Wall Street in
<br>
January: Revenue will grow 50% in 2001.
<br>
<p>Forrester's revenue has grown more than six-fold since it went public in
<br>
1996, to $157 million last year. Mr. Colony says demand for his
<br>
company's
<br>
services is still strong, and dot-coms never accounted for more than 4%
<br>
of
<br>
revenue. &quot;Some of the world's largest companies are our clients,&quot; he
<br>
says,
<br>
though he declines to identify any. The company's fees average $51,200 a
<br>
client, according to regulatory filings.
<br>
<p>But Forrester's client roster grew just 4% in the fourth quarter,
<br>
compared
<br>
with 15% a year earlier, according to regulatory filings. And even the
<br>
largest technology companies are cutting expenses now, analysts say,
<br>
making
<br>
it tougher for Forrester to attract and retain clients for its research,
<br>
consulting and conferences.
<br>
<p>Analysts expect Forrester to earn 20 cents a share for the quarter ended
<br>
March 31, according to a survey by Thomson Financial/First Call. But
<br>
some
<br>
are questioning Forrester's ability to increase revenue 50%.
<br>
<p>Founded in 1983, Forrester started out tracking the personal-computer
<br>
industry. It branched into consumer-behavior research in 1994, and that
<br>
same year started forecasting how a new thing called the Internet would
<br>
&quot;change the rules of the game.&quot;
<br>
<p>Forrester was among a handful of firms to start quantifying how the Net
<br>
would change business and consumer-spending habits. For example, in
<br>
November 1998, Forrester reported that by 2003, U.S. consumers would buy
<br>
more than $108 billion of goods over the Web, up from $7.8 billion that
<br>
year.
<br>
<p>Forrester forecasts became a mainstay for scores of dot-com companies
<br>
that
<br>
were trying to sell their business plans. In 1998 and 1999, according to
<br>
10Kwizard.com, more than 200 Internet-related companies cited Forrester
<br>
studies in IPO documents. &quot;Forrester's research enabled small companies
<br>
with little or no track records to forecast huge growth but attribute
<br>
what
<br>
they were saying to someone else,&quot; says Bob Grandhi, chief investment
<br>
officer at Monument Advisors, a Bethesda, Md., family of mutual funds
<br>
that
<br>
invest primarily in tech stocks.
<br>
<p>Wall Street analysts relied on Forrester, too. When Morgan Stanley Dean
<br>
Witter's Mary Meeker and Merrill Lynch's Henry Blodgett were writing
<br>
reports recommending Internet stocks, they frequently relied on
<br>
estimates
<br>
provided by Forrester and other firms. Ms. Meeker and Mr. Blodgett
<br>
declined
<br>
to comment.
<br>
<p>Some Forrester forecasts have been on target. In a report released April
<br>
11, 2000, just four weeks after the Nasdaq Stock Market reached its
<br>
peak,
<br>
Forrester predicted the &quot;imminent demise of most dot-com retailers.&quot;
<br>
<p>But other estimates were overly optimistic. For example, last September
<br>
Forrester estimated $44.8 billion of e-commerce sales in 2000. But
<br>
according to the Commerce Department, e-commerce sales last year were
<br>
$25.8
<br>
billion. Forrester analyst Evie Black Dykema says the firm includes
<br>
tickets
<br>
bought online for flights, concerts and sporting events in its
<br>
e-commerce
<br>
data, and the Commerce Department doesn't. &quot;If you take out those items,
<br>
the numbers would be a lot closer,&quot; she says.
<br>
<p>Investment pros say accuracy isn't really the issue when considering
<br>
Forrester forecasts. &quot;They provide guideposts about the industry that
<br>
aren't easy to come up with anywhere else,&quot; says Mr. Grandhi of Monument
<br>
Advisors. &quot;My impression is they tend to be a little on the optimistic
<br>
side. But I don't think that matters so much as that they get the
<br>
broader
<br>
trends right.&quot;
<br>
<p>Jaime Punishill, who prepared Forrester's online-mortgage-industry
<br>
report
<br>
in January 1999, says his forecast was based on discussions with the
<br>
Federal Reserve Bank, industry trade groups, and 50 leading mortgage
<br>
lenders. He then plugged their numbers into proprietary models
<br>
anticipating
<br>
growth in Internet usage.
<br>
<p>He adds that his estimate will prove accurate &quot;within reason,&quot; and so
<br>
far,
<br>
it appears to be on track. He forecast that online mortgages would be
<br>
2.7%
<br>
of the market in 2000. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association of
<br>
America, online mortgages accounted for 3% of the market last year.
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't think clients expect us to be accurate to the last dollar,&quot; Mr.
<br>
Punishill says. &quot;A lot of things that affect the mortgage market, such
<br>
as
<br>
interest rates, are beyond my control.&quot;
