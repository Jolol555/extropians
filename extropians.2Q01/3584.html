<p>Well, at least E. O. Wilson would.  But when you say &quot;type&quot;,
<br>
you're introducing a subtle shift in the argument.  I doubt
<br>
if even E. O. Wilson would claim that every individual of
<br>
some obscure species of Amazon jungle ant need be preserved.
<br>
Two conspecifics of a particular ant species just aren't
<br>
that different.  So pop some randomly-chosen handful of ants into
<br>
a Dewar of liquid nitrogen, if you must, and don't worry if
<br>
you step on a few other ants in the process.
<br>
<p>I remember seeing somebody (I'm pretty sure it was Eliezer)
<br>
comment that, as far as human personalities are concerned,
<br>
there's probably only a surprisingly small number (on the
<br>
order of a million, I think was the offered guess) of distinct
<br>
human memetic &quot;types&quot;.
<br>
<p>I imagine it wouldn't take a lot of data to blend up somebody
<br>
a lot like Jim F. at the personality paint store.  Garden-variety
<br>
mid-20th-century style American middle-class background (in
<br>
other words, economic circumstances better than the vast
<br>
majority of contemporary human beings), only child, rather
<br>
timid and introverted (maybe genetic, maybe because he was
<br>
the somewhat premature Caesarian first child of a mother
<br>
who was almost past child-bearing age), modestly gifted
<br>
intellectually (140ish IQ).  Then throw in the DC comic books,
<br>
the squirt of Arthur C. Clarke, the dollop of J. R. R. Tolkien,
<br>
_The Outer Limits_ and _Star Trek_, a little Bertrand Russell
<br>
for seasoning, and voila!  OK, so maybe nobody else remembers the
<br>
particular house in Shavertown, Pennsylvania where my grandparents
<br>
lived in the 60's, or Gelbach's Diner in Reading where we used
<br>
to stop on the way to visit them.  But there were a lot of
<br>
awfully similar elderly couples, houses, and diners.  Which
<br>
of these differences makes a difference worth preserving, in how
<br>
much detail? (I know that's an unanswerable, purely rhetorical
<br>
question).
<br>
<p>So yeah, it would be one thing to be preserved as a
<br>
random example of the &quot;type&quot; of the human species, perhaps
<br>
in some post-holocaust alien-rescue scenario like
<br>
Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis books, or to be chosen
<br>
as a zoo-specimen by an alien E. O. Wilson
<br>
scientist/collector as in Gregory Benford's _Eater_.
<br>
<p>But how many of us can really objectively believe that we
<br>
embody a pattern so unique and valuable that we couldn't
<br>
be replaced by one of the other six billion humans on
<br>
the planet (or some pattern synthesized from the &quot;types&quot;
<br>
they represent) without making a dent in the history of the
<br>
Cosmos?  That's not to say it wouldn't be fun to be along
<br>
for the ride, but that's different -- it's a question of,
<br>
well, entertainment.
<br>
<p>Jim F.
