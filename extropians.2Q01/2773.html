<p>Stock Market 'Planetarium'
<br>
<p>It's perhaps unsurprising that people are talking about vulgar things
<br>
like
<br>
the stock market in the rarified quarters of the Tate Britain, the
<br>
United
<br>
Kingdom's national gallery in London. After all, where else will they
<br>
get
<br>
the money to buy all of that art? But while the rest of us are pondering
<br>
the great question of bull or bear, the Queen's subjects may be asking
<br>
themselves &quot;Taurus or Ursa Major?&quot;
<br>
<p>The &quot;Stock Market Planetarium&quot; on exhibition through the start of June
<br>
in
<br>
the domed Art Now gallery at the Tate Britain (and available over the
<br>
web)
<br>
seeks to not only represent trading activity through the metaphor of a
<br>
starry sky, but to move towards predicting it. Computer generated stars
<br>
projected onto the 2.5-meter dome represent publicly traded companies in
<br>
real-time. As shares are bought or sold, corresponding stars flicker and
<br>
glow. Stars subject to similar trading patterns become gravitationally
<br>
attracted to each other, forming industrial clusters and constellations.
<br>
Look for the blue blaze of the Cisco Systems star or the majesty of the
<br>
Petrochemical Nebula.
<br>
<p>Though William Butler Yeats posited that the legendary King Fergus of
<br>
Ireland ruled &quot;all disheveled wandering stars,&quot; in the Stock Market
<br>
Planetarium stars drift in an intricate dance of interactions. Their
<br>
myriad
<br>
trading patterns eventually formed galaxies out of the even spread of
<br>
lights that was the primordial sky of March, when the display opened.
<br>
For
<br>
example, the exhibition's creators explain &quot;the recent collapse of east
<br>
Asian prices and the sudden rush to sell would have caused all the
<br>
companies affected to glow very brightly and to be pulled towards each
<br>
other in a very powerful vortex.&quot;
<br>
<p>Also thrown into the mix is something we're still desperately searching
<br>
for
<br>
in real astronomy: extraterrestrial creatures. Simple virtual organisms
<br>
feed off of the energy produced by capital flows (starving in trading
<br>
lulls), and may lend predictive value to this process as some
<br>
evolutionary
<br>
lines grow more cunning at finding food than others. How this
<br>
intelligent
<br>
behavior will occur, as opposed to a sort of phototropism, isn't clear.
<br>
But
<br>
each creature is endowed by a &quot;genetic program&quot; with different
<br>
attributes
<br>
that it may use to its advantage, such as speed, breeding cycles, and
<br>
longevity. Eventually creatures akin to farmers, parasites, grazers and
<br>
predators may even develop, according to the project's website.
<br>
<p>Black Shoals Stock Market Planetarium is an art project created by
<br>
Joshua
<br>
Portway of Peter Gabriel's Real World studio and artist Lise Autogena,
<br>
with
<br>
the bestiary supplied by Cefn Hoile, a graduate student in Evolutionary
<br>
and
<br>
Adaptive Systems at the University of Sussex and a contract programmer
<br>
with
<br>
BT PLC Future Technologies Group. The Reuters financial news service is
<br>
supplying the data lifeblood of the effort.
<br>
<p>As we ponder the mysteries of the markets and the universe, one can only
<br>
hope that the recent confirmations that the bubble of our universe has
<br>
not
<br>
burst or begun to collapse - indeed that it continues to expand at an
<br>
accelerating rate - will rub off on the activity represented by the
<br>
Stock
<br>
Market Planetarium.
