<p>Hey -- we both know I've got the &quot;true&quot; version of extropianism,
<br>
in my version we only turn the &quot;virtual&quot; philosophers into sausages.

<p><em>&gt; One can develop the above argument into a more watertight ethical

<p>Ooooh, this is good.  This means that when Eliezer's SysOp finds out
<br>
it doesn't have the resources to solve a particularly thorny ethical
<br>
dilemma, it comes to me (where in my MBrain, we can wipe the slate
<br>
clean of all the cycle consuming ancestor simulations) so we can
<br>
dedicate the computronium to a &quot;real&quot; problem.  It can't solve it
<br>
itself without violating its &quot;Self-Imposed Laws of Friendly AIs&quot;,
<br>
it can however get me to do its dirty work...  Something for everyone!
<br>
<p>Thats just great!
