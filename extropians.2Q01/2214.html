<p><em>&gt;While this is fun, what I would like to see is a true god game: you create
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your own universe, with physical laws and upwards. That way even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emergence would appear. Of course, writing a good, understandable and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beautiful game for it would be very hard.
</em><br>
<p>In my early teens, myself and my brother were positively addicted to Sierra
<br>
on Line's adventure games. The Space Quest and King's Quest series, among
<br>
others. I confess to pirating large numbers of them, simply because A) I had
<br>
no job at the time, but mainly because we ripped through each one so fast
<br>
(2-3 days) that it seemed silly.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't engage in that kind of wholesale software piracy now. A) I
<br>
actually have money, and B) my attitude towards IP has changed considerably.
<br>
But that's neither here nor there.
<br>
<p>When I first got into programming, in my mid-teens, it seemed to follow
<br>
naturally from this interest in adventure puzzle games. Programming a medium
<br>
sized project simply felt like the next level of adventure game. But it was
<br>
much more of a God game then an adventure game. You're manipulating tokens
<br>
together in pursuit of a goal, but the tokens you manipulate are that much
<br>
lower level. The big advantage was, that unlike canned adventure games,
<br>
/you/ made the goal, and the degree of interactivity you had with the
<br>
puzzles, the number of ways you could solve an individual problem was a lot
<br>
higher.
<br>
<p>Moreover, it's a creative experience. I was programming simulation games,
<br>
and that felt a lot like the /real/ &quot;god game&quot; experience you just
<br>
described. Setting up a pocket universe, one law of physics at a time :)
<br>
<p>So I a sense, your &quot;god game&quot; already exists. But It WOULD be amazing for
<br>
someone to produce a more user friendly simulation package, specifically
<br>
optimized for the sort of programming that simulations require. I'll have to
<br>
put that on my list :)
