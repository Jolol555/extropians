<p><em>&gt;I think that unions serve a very important purpose by increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the bargaining power of individuals whose bargaining power alone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is too weak to change bad employment practices.  I also admire the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;courage that many union leaders have shown when forming unions.
</em><br>
<p>I thought it a good thing when the AMA voted to unionize to battle
<br>
the HMO's.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I'm also happy to see that the AFL-CIO is beginning to call for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;...the repeal of employer sanctions, for a new amnesty for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;undocumented, and for a broad new program to educate immigrant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;workers about their rights.....&quot;  (
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.ncmonline.com/commentary/2000-02-25/afl.html">http://www.ncmonline.com/commentary/2000-02-25/afl.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;).  Prior to this new position, it struck me as odd that unions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work to make it more difficult for sweatshop workers to escape to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an environment where better pay and working conditions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;available.
</em><br>
<p>Valuble new recruits.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The median annual income in the U.S. is roughly $30,000 dollars;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the median annual world income is about $8,000 dollars.  If one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were concerned about the suffering of the working poor, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldn't it be better to buy from someone making $8 K/year than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;$30 K/year?  (Assuming that they're not working under &quot;sweatshop&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conditions.)
</em><br>
<p>As long as they are paid a fair &quot;local wage&quot;, I'm open, if they're
<br>
Union even better. I have a strong tendency toward community, it's
<br>
important that my neighbors are working first, before I go
<br>
elsewhere.
<br>
<p>I dropped my car (Buick Riveria) off at the local Firestone dealer
<br>
this morning, the manager is African/American, most of the
<br>
mechanics are Hispanic/Latino, my cleaners are Korean, most of my
<br>
favorite local restaurants are Greek.
<br>
<p>I can support vast cultures in my own neighborhood.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, I agree.  I think that you got tarred with the &quot;jingoist&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brush
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(<a href="http://projects.ghostwheel.com/dictionary?define=nationalistic">http://projects.ghostwheel.com/dictionary?define=nationalistic</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because you mentioned that you wanted to start a &quot;Made in the USA&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;store.  Your criteria for purchasing goods seemed to be based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;primarily on the happenstance of location, rather than what would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually help the working class the most.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I was just following the Extropian spiral (that thing
<br>
really needs a name!) starting with myself, family, neighbors, etc,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It seems to me that it would help more workers improve their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;standard of living if you started a &quot;Sweatshop Free&quot; store
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that purchased goods from companies that employed workers from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;poor countries, but who treated their workers well.   (as, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example,  The Body Shop appears to do)
</em><br>
<p><p>I think this is a good idea, you could have a store within my
<br>
stores ;) How about a store that only sells Union made goods from
<br>
whatever country?
<br>
<p>Actually I first had this idea after reading an ecology based
<br>
socialist novel, Ernest Callenbach's &quot;Ecotopia&quot;. They had these
<br>
core stores that sold basic goods that were simple and inexpensive.
<br>
I thought it was a terrific idea.
<br>
<p>Personnally I working more towards &quot;Extropia&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's also unclear to me that boycotting companies who employ
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children working under sweatshop conditions will necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improve the lot of those children.  Let's assume that the boycott
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is successful, and the company goes out of business.  What happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt;next?  What do you expect will replace the income (pittance that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it was) that the child earned?
</em><br>
<p>This if course is a bigger tougher issue. The very least any
<br>
company can do in my opinion is make sure it's factories follow
<br>
basic human decency.
<br>
<p>Child labor here would never be permitted under these
<br>
circumstances, and people from here should not permit it elsewhere.
<br>
<p>Invoking the Golden rule.
