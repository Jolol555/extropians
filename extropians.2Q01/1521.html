I didn't realize Seattle now has season variation. :)

Of course the big question here is how to support the antecedent of your
<br>
conditional, viz., if [human] physicists are approaching a complete TOE ....
<br>
Even if a hundred thousand generations of human physicists agree that the
<br>
TOE published by the great physicist Newteinstein back in 2002 is the final
<br>
theory of everything this will not allay the skeptical doubts that humans
<br>
are cognitively incapable of comprehending the real final theory of
<br>
everything. The fact that our conceptual abilities are endogenously
<br>
constrained is perhaps more familiar from biology than cognitive science:
<br>
whatever the final TOE turns out to be we don't expect that chimps or
<br>
australopithecines would be able to comprehend it, what makes us so sure
<br>
that humans are far enough along the cognitive curve? Of course reasons have
<br>
been put forward for believing that we are far enough along this curve,
<br>
from philosophers like Plato, Hegel and Davidson, and physicists like
<br>
Hawking and Weinberg. The view that I put forward in my dissertation was
<br>
that this is all an interesting theoretical discussion--and of  course as
<br>
dissertations go, this took about 300 pages to say--but, like any good
<br>
scientific, question it ought to be put to the test.  The idea would be to
<br>
attempt to create better scientists in the sense that they come up with a
<br>
better TOE. If the experiment succeeds then we reject the null hypothesis,
<br>
if the experiment fails then we accept the null hypothesis. This experiment
<br>
is of course the one affectionately known as 'transhumanism'. (I used to
<br>
call this project 'Becoming Gods', which is the title of my dissertation). I
<br>
am presenting a paper on this topic at the Canadian Philosophical
<br>
Association at the end of May. Mark.
