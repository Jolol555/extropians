<p>Click and Win: Inventors Cash In on Their Ideas
<br>
<p>By DEBORAH KONG
<br>
<p>ichael Smithson'S epiphany came about 10 minutes into his career as an
<br>
inventor. While reading about a Coca-Cola contest to dream up an
<br>
entertaining and healthy drink for children, he recalled how his
<br>
9-year-old
<br>
grandson had trouble keeping track of his tackle, rods, snacks and
<br>
sunscreen on a fishing trip last summer. Because children are prone to
<br>
losing things, Mr. Smithson suggested a frozen drink in a container that
<br>
children can wear on their wrists, as they would a bracelet, and sip as
<br>
it
<br>
thaws. He found out a few weeks ago that he had won the $5,000 prize.
<br>
<p>Albert Muller struck pay dirt, too, but it took 28 years. Mr. Muller, a
<br>
retired Boeing engineer, spent that time perfecting a better nozzle for
<br>
heavy-duty vacuum cleaners, but he dreaded the process of selling his
<br>
invention to appliance makers. Then he heard that Sears, Roebuck was
<br>
offering $5,000 for the best idea for &quot;the next hot tool,&quot; and he
<br>
pitched
<br>
the nozzle. Sears bought it.
<br>
<p>Both men connected with the companies through Ideas.com, a Mountain
<br>
View,
<br>
Calif., company whose Web site helps people who fancy themselves as the
<br>
next Thomas Edison to send their ideas directly to corporate decision
<br>
makers. Mr. Smithson and Mr. Muller are among the first winners of
<br>
innovation contests that Ideas.com began when it went online in
<br>
November.
<br>
<p>Ideas.com, one of several new sites that buy, sell or solicit
<br>
intellectual
<br>
property, may be a win-win solution for companies and inventors.
<br>
&quot;Companies
<br>
are scrambling all the time to come up with new ideas&quot; because of faster
<br>
product cycles, said Sanjay Goel, the site's founder and chief
<br>
executive.
<br>
The Internet is a natural place to look, because many people who use it
<br>
are
<br>
technologically knowledgeable and naturally curious. And the sites
<br>
provide
<br>
an easy way to gauge consumer trends.
<br>
<p>&quot;It used to be we would come up with an idea, and consumers would help
<br>
us
<br>
evaluate it, refine it&quot; in focus groups, said Tom LaForge, director of
<br>
innovations at Coca- Cola. &quot;Now we're getting to consumers one step
<br>
earlier, and they're coming up with the ideas.&quot;
<br>
<p>With the economy slowing, the time is certainly ripe. &quot;In many ways,
<br>
companies are going to be trying to sell themselves out of this
<br>
downturn,&quot;
<br>
said John Fontanella, an analyst at AMR Research in Boston.
<br>
<p>Mr. Goel started Ideas.com a year ago after struggling to find a home
<br>
for
<br>
his own idea for a new car gadget. He envisioned a site where large
<br>
corporations could collect ideas from people around the world, saving
<br>
individuals the headache and expense of patenting and developing ideas
<br>
on
<br>
their own and sparing companies the bother and potential legal liability
<br>
of
<br>
sifting through a flood of unsolicited ideas.
<br>
<p>There is a tradeoff. On the site, would-be inventors must accept an
<br>
agreement intended to protect companies from lawsuits accusing them of
<br>
stealing inventions. Steven L. Smith, a Sacramento patent lawyer,
<br>
cautioned
<br>
that inventors might be relinquishing the rights to their ideas simply
<br>
by
<br>
submitting them, and said he advises inventors to require companies to
<br>
sign
<br>
nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
Mr. Goel quit his job as an investment banker at Citibank in late 1999
<br>
after receiving a $1.2 million investment from Venky Harinarayan, a
<br>
former
<br>
classmate at the University of California at Los Angeles, and Anand
<br>
Rajaraman and Rakesh Mathur. The three men were among the founders of
<br>
the
<br>
Junglee Corporation, which made software to help consumers find the best
<br>
prices for products on the Internet; Junglee was sold to Amazon.com in
<br>
1998
<br>
for about $250 million.
<br>
<p>Mr. Goel then persuaded a former New York University classmate and
<br>
skydiving pal, Sharat Singh, to quit his job as a lead program manager
<br>
at
<br>
Microsoft and to become president and chief technology officer of
<br>
Ideas.com. They secured the backing of Coca-Cola, Sears, Roebuck, S. C.
<br>
Johnson &amp; Son and International Paper, which agreed to pay an
<br>
undisclosed
<br>
membership fee. Ideas.com also receives a commission of about 30 percent
<br>
from the idea contest awards, paid by the companies.
<br>
<p>Coca-Cola and Sears said that they were impressed with the quality of
<br>
ideas
<br>
from the first contests.
<br>
<p>A Coke competition seeking innovative ideas in packaging, for example,
<br>
was
<br>
won by Spencer Wolf, who proposed a drink container that illuminates
<br>
itself
<br>
when squeezed. Mr. Wolf, who studied mechanical engineering at Cornell
<br>
and
<br>
is now pursuing a master's degree in business administration at
<br>
U.C.L.A.,
<br>
said his idea went back to when he asked his father what caused
<br>
fireflies
<br>
to glow without the benefit of electrical outlet or batteries. The
<br>
invention uses piezoelectricity, a mechanical phenomenon that replicates
<br>
that effect with crystals.
<br>
<p>Coca-Cola said that it was evaluating Mr. Smithson's idea for the
<br>
wrist-worn container and that Mr. Wolf's proposal for the self-
<br>
illuminating container might be explored later. Other ideas, from
<br>
doctors,
<br>
college students, professors, children and parents, have confirmed some
<br>
consumer trends that the company is exploring.
<br>
<p>&quot;A lot of consumers were asking for healthier drinks that had to do with
<br>
soy,&quot; Mr. LaForge said. &quot;I didn't realize how many people would be
<br>
interested in that type of product.&quot; Other ideas, like packaging drinks
<br>
with tablets that add vitamins or flavors, suggest &quot;people are really
<br>
looking for more customization,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>In judging the ideas for drinks, Coke was looking for a unique, healthy
<br>
product with innovative packaging. Entries in a separate packaging
<br>
contest
<br>
had to be cost-effective, technically sound, easy to make and use, and
<br>
meet
<br>
safety, health and environmental standards. Judges included employees
<br>
from
<br>
Coke's legal, marketing, technical engineering and new product
<br>
development
<br>
departments. The company plans to post all 889 contest ideas on its
<br>
internal Web site.
<br>
<p>Mr. Smithson, 46, an insurance salesman from Leesburg, Fla., is among
<br>
many
<br>
people who have submitted ideas but have not previously considered
<br>
themselves professional inventors. &quot;In day-to-day life, you don't really
<br>
get poked and prodded into having a lot of ideas,&quot; he said. &quot;Something
<br>
like
<br>
this, it makes you think.&quot;
<br>
<p>But Mr. Muller, who lives in Houston, has long taken innovation
<br>
seriously.
<br>
He belongs to the Houston Inventors Association, whose members share
<br>
experiences and tips on developing ideas into products.
<br>
<p>He noted that raking leaves 28 years ago, on the patio of his former
<br>
home
<br>
in Southern California, spurred him to look for an easier solution. &quot;I'm
<br>
always looking at things to see how they work,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Sears said it was reviewing patent documents and prototypes of Mr.
<br>
Muller's
<br>
invention to help decide if it wants to sell the product.
<br>
<p>The Sears contest, which drew 135 entries, was also a way to channel
<br>
some
<br>
of the thousands of unsolicited ideas that the company receives each
<br>
year.
<br>
Invention proposals sometimes arrive on handwritten letters and home
<br>
videos
<br>
addressed to the chief executive's office, on scraps of paper handed to
<br>
sales representatives or - in the case of a pink lawn mower designed as
<br>
part of a lawn-and-garden set for women - carried into the company's
<br>
headquarters in Hoffman Estates, Ill.
<br>
<p>&quot;In the midst of that disorderliness, we have the sense that there may
<br>
be
<br>
some terrific ideas out there,&quot; said Steve Kirn, vice president for
<br>
innovation and organizational development at Sears. In October, Sears
<br>
sought refrigerator improvement ideas through a competing site,
<br>
www.brightidea.com. Companies pay the site $50,000 to be the host of
<br>
such
<br>
contests.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
Other sites that solicit consumer ideas, like www.ideadollar.com and
<br>
www.brainhead.com, are developing a few of them into products, offering
<br>
inventors a stake if the idea turns into a new company or a share of
<br>
royalties or sales. Ideadollar said one idea, for waterproof shower
<br>
posters, has been turned into a product that will be in stores next
<br>
month.
<br>
Among ideas it received, said its chief executive, Mark Turrell, &quot;we are
<br>
probably sitting on the next Razor scooter.&quot;
<br>
<p>Business-oriented sites, like www.yet2.com and www.pl-x.com, operated by
<br>
the Patent &amp; License Exchange, also function as marketplaces where
<br>
companies buy and sell intellectual property. Honeywell International,
<br>
for
<br>
example, lists almost 100 technologies on yet2.com, hoping to attract
<br>
new
<br>
licensing revenue.
<br>
<p>At Ideas.com, which has grown from 2 to 10 employees in the last year,
<br>
the
<br>
biggest challenge is to persuade more companies to conduct idea contests
<br>
and to pay membership fees. The site is also trying to license software
<br>
that will let companies collect ideas from their employees.
<br>
<p>Mr. Goel asks companies to use his site to contract out some of their
<br>
innovation, just as they might rely on outsiders for public relations or
<br>
market research. They may find the next multibillion-dollar idea there,
<br>
he
<br>
said, reeling off a list of possibilities. &quot;It could be the new Coke,&quot;
<br>
he
<br>
said. &quot;It could be a new way of distributing foods. It could be a new
<br>
form
<br>
of energy.&quot;
