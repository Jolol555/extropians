T-shirts are a matter of extreme importance and I am glad it is getting the focused attention needed.  I just hope sweatshirts are also provided for people from the colder climes like Alaska.

<p>Aren't there already greeting cards and underwear which play music? lol  I guess it just won't stop there...

<p>Max happens to be a very kick-ass guy so I bet he will allow it! :)  But of course, the final decision is his.

<p>So, a graph which is spiking through the roof.  Hey, better let Damien in on this one! 
<br>
<p>I feel t-shirts are simply not enough.  We need an extropian variation of the redneck hat with the two straps for soda cans and the connecting straw.  Ours will have a witty saying about boosting brainpower and the sodas will in fact be nootropics.  Then again...
<br>
<p>Seriously, we need baseball style caps with extropian symbols and sayings.  I don't know how things are in Europe or Australia but in the U.S. we just love our baseball caps.  Alcor has them for sale which is a sign.  
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
<br>
<p>P.S.  Just a little reminder, everyone needs to rush out and buy a copy of &quot;the Spike&quot; by Damien Broderick.  The book should be on sale at Extro 5 with me promoting it so you can all have the chance to look at it.
