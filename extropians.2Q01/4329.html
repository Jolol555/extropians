<p>the problem is that a factor of 10 improvement doesn't buy you much in
<br>
chess since the tree to be searched is exponential.  Algorithms and
<br>
evaluation improvements make a much bigger difference.

<p>They are played and (some at least) are not behind closed doors.  There
<br>
was a recent match between 10 IMs and GMs versus Deep Fritz and Deep
<br>
Junior (two very strong programs, Fritz and Junior, running on Quad PIII
<br>
1Ghz.  It has become a custom to prepend Deep on any program when it runs
<br>
on multiprocessors), and the computer pair won 15-5 or something along
<br>
those lines.  Deep Junior also took part in a super-GM tournament recently
<br>
(super-GMs mainly being top 20 people) and came fourth with 50% score.
<br>
There is a match coming up (or just happened, dunno, haven't been keeping
<br>
up) between Kramnik (current world champion) and either Junior or Fritz.
<br>
Kramnik is a computer specialist though, so he is supposed to win.  Both
<br>
Junior and Fritz have FIDE ratings that would put them in the top twenty,
<br>
and they play quite a bit of tournaments.  Shredder, the current computer
<br>
champion, doesn't play much though.
