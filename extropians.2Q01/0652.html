Subject: Re: How To Live In A Simulation
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How do you know that there is suffering? If you are unhappy right now, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grant that you know it. But if not, then your memories of suffering could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be fake.
</em><br>
<p>Even the present could be *fake* since we are in some degree
<br>
of trance permenantly. I can induce both positive &amp; negative
<br>
hallucinations in a subject, and make them report/ feel something
<br>
entirely other than the *object* state of affairs.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;If a best possible world is one where all possible positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experiences occur and no negative experiences occur, then if you are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happy it seems that your current evidence is perfectly compatible with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;best-possible-worlds hypothesis. You can poke your finger with a needle,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and for a while you'll know that the hypothesis is false, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refutation doesn't stick. As soon as you are happy again, you can't be
</em><br>
sure.
<br>
<p>We can set up anchors and reinforcements of desired states. Can also
<br>
use timeline or other regressions to check what happened previously (or
<br>
recreate previous state if you take that view).
<br>
<p>Anyway, some people enjoy having their fingers poked with a
<br>
needle, and even pay for dominatrixes to whip them  .......
