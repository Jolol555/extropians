<p>$500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize awarded to FUTURIST
<br>
who make a career of helping others
<br>
<p>Artificial Intelligence Innovator Raymond Kurzweil
<br>
Invented First Reading Machine for the Blind-
<br>
<p>New York, NY, April 24, 2001 - The Lemelson-MIT Program announced today that
<br>
its annual $500,000 prize - the world's largest single award for invention
<br>
and innovation - is being presented to futurist Raymond Kurzweil, a pioneer
<br>
of pattern recognition technologies who has made a career of helping others,
<br>
while showing a flair for integrating technology and the arts. Over the
<br>
past 35 years, Kurzweil has produced a lengthy list of achievements and
<br>
innovations that have enriched society, including: advancing artificial
<br>
intelligence (AI) technologies; founding, developing and selling four
<br>
successful companies; and writing two best-selling books that support his
<br>
predictions for the 21st century. Kurzweil is being recognized by the
<br>
Lemelson-MIT Program for the breadth and scope of his inventive work, and
<br>
for his commitment to enhancing the quality of life for people with
<br>
disabilities through technology.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil is credited with many invention &quot;firsts&quot; that span such diverse
<br>
fields as pattern recognition, speech technology, music and the visual arts.
<br>
These include the first omni-font optical character recognition (OCR)
<br>
computer program; the first print-to-speech reading machine for the blind;
<br>
the first text-to-speech synthesizer; the first electronic
<br>
musical instrument capable of reproducing
<br>
the sounds of orchestral instruments; and the first commercially-marketed
<br>
large vocabulary speech recognition system. Kurzweil's latest innovation
<br>
represents an advance in virtual reality technology, a virtual performing
<br>
and recording artist, &quot;Ramona.&quot;
<br>
<p>Kurzweil's landmark invention is the Kurzweil Reading Machine, introduced in
<br>
1976, which converts print to speech. To date, the Kurzweil Reading Machine
<br>
has made it possible for many thousands of blind people to read the text of
<br>
ordinary books, magazines and other printed documents. The first owner of a
<br>
Kurzweil Reading Machine was legendary musician Stevie Wonder, who contacted
<br>
Kurzweil after hearing about the device.
<br>
<p>&quot;The Kurzweil Reading Machine was a breakthrough that changed my life,&quot;
<br>
says Wonder, who helped nominate Kurzweil for the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize.
<br>
&quot;With the Kurzweil Reading Machine, I could read anything I wanted with
<br>
complete privacy: music lyrics, letters from my children, the latest best 
<br>
sellers
<br>
and magazines, memos from my business associates. It gave blind people
<br>
the one thing that everyone treasures, which is independence.&quot;
<br>
<p>Consequently, it was Kurzweil's friendship with Wonder which led to another
<br>
major innovation: the Kurzweil 250 Synthesizer (K250). On a tour through
<br>
Wonder's studio in 1982, Kurzweil learned of Wonder's frustrations with the
<br>
current technical limitations that prevented the bridging of electronic
<br>
music composition with the sounds of acoustic instruments. Introduced
<br>
commercially in 1984, the K250 was the first electronic musical instrument
<br>
to emulate successfully the complex sound response of a grand piano and
<br>
virtually all other orchestral instruments.
<br>
<p>Currently, Kurzweil is focusing on www.KurzweilAI.net (Kurzweil Accelerating
<br>
Intelligence Network), a Web-based subsidiary of Kurzweil Technologies, Inc.
<br>
(KTI) that showcases ideas of leading technologists and &quot;big thinkers.&quot; The
<br>
main concentration of KurzweilAI.net is on the exponential growth of
<br>
intelligence, both biological and artificial. &quot;Ramona,&quot; Kurzweil's alter
<br>
ego and a lifelike, photo-realistic, interactive avatar (virtual
<br>
personality) with conversational abilities, simultaneously guides users
<br>
through KurzweilAI.net and showcases the latest advancements in intelligent
<br>
machines.
<br>
<p>Other KTI companies include:
<br>
<p>Medical Learning Company (MLC), developer of www.FamilyPractice.com, a
<br>
comprehensive online resource for family practice physicians which has also
<br>
developed a virtual patient for use in medical training. MLC is a joint
<br>
venture between KTI and the American Board of Family Practice, the second
<br>
largest medical specialty board in the U.S.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil CyberArt Technologies (KCAT), which develops and markets
<br>
artificially intelligent software to aid the creative process, including Ray
<br>
Kurzweil's Cybernetic Poet that helps users write poetry and song lyrics,
<br>
and the forthcoming AARON (developed by computer scientist and artist,
<br>
Harold Cohen), which &quot;paints&quot; original art on computer screens. KCAT is
<br>
launching AARON today and free trial copies of the software are available at
<br>
www.KurzweilCyberArt.com.
<br>
<p>FatKat, Inc. (Financial Accelerating Transactions from Kurzweil Adaptive
<br>
Technologies), which is currently developing pattern recognition-based
<br>
technology to make stock market investment decisions.
<br>
<p>Previous recipients of the annual $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize include Thomas
<br>
Fogarty, surgical pioneer and inventor of the embolectomy balloon catheter;
<br>
Carver Mead, physicist who revolutionized the field of microelectronics;
<br>
Robert Langer, inventor of the first FDA-approved brain cancer treatment;
<br>
and Douglas Englebart, computing visionary and inventor of the computer
<br>
mouse.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil will be formally presented with the Lemelson-MIT Prize on
<br>
Wednesday, April 25, at a special ceremony at the Smithsonian's National
<br>
Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. This year, the ceremony will
<br>
be held in conjunction with &quot;Nobel Week,&quot; a series of programs honoring the
<br>
centennial of the Nobel Prizes, hosted by the Lemelson Center for the Study
<br>
of Invention and Innovation at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American
<br>
History.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil gratefully acknowledges the role that his creative parents as well
<br>
as his teachers and peers have played in his success as an inventor over the
<br>
years. &quot;Encouragement is necessary for young inventors to succeed. It is
<br>
important for kids to realize that they have the authority to explore their
<br>
own ideas and that it is okay to fail,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>ABOUT THE LEMELSON-MIT PROGRAM
<br>
Based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge,
<br>
Massachusetts, the Lemelson-MIT Program was established in 1994 by the late
<br>
independent inventor Jerome H. Lemelson and his wife, Dorothy. The Program
<br>
celebrates inventor/innovator role models through outreach activities and
<br>
annual awards including the world's largest for invention, the $500,000
<br>
Lemelson-MIT Prize. The Program encourages young Americans to pursue
<br>
careers in the fields of science, engineering, technology and
<br>
entrepreneurship. The Lemelson-MIT Program is funded by the Lemelson
<br>
Foundation, which supports other invention initiatives at the Smithsonian's
<br>
National Museum of American History, Hampshire College, the National
<br>
Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance and the University of Nevada,
<br>
Reno. For more information about the Lemelson-MIT Program, please visit its
