<p>Maybe this is also due to the small size of the string theory community? One 
<br>
things refereeing does is to filter out the mass of bad papers so that it 
<br>
becomes easier to concentrate on the good ones. If I had to read every paper 
<br>
that appeared on hippocampus, memory consolidation and attractor neural 
<br>
network I would not have the time to do any research (I hardly have any right 
<br>
now :-).
