Not certain what we can do about it, but certain that the time is 
<br>
soon. James Cameron has several space-related projects in the pipe, 
<br>
to be kicked off with a series about the first manned mission to 
<br>
Mars. From an as-yet-unpublished interview:
<br>
<p>&quot;I’m hoping that it [the films/series] can have an impact. That’s my 
<br>
motivation for making some of the projects... I’ve spent the last 
<br>
year and a half planning several of these. I want to get people 
<br>
reinvigorated about the space efforts we’re making right now and what 
<br>
we hope that will be a springboard to—which is the exploration of 
<br>
Mars.&quot;
<br>
<p>We have here a man with an unparalleled global media reach. If anyone 
<br>
can get American--indeed world--society into a &quot;go mode&quot; for space 
<br>
exploration, this would be the guy. NASA takes him very seriously, 
<br>
and his knowledge of the details is impressive. Politicians bow to 
<br>
public will. If the public is screaming for men on Mars, we might get 
<br>
just that--likely the NASA version, of course.
<br>
<p>So whatever you come up with, plan to implement soon--possibly within 
<br>
a year (Cameron's best estimate on time of debut--though he notes he 
<br>
said the same thing a year ago...).
