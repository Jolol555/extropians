<p>I'm not clear Emlyn whether you are agreeing with me or the idea
<br>
that there is an IT worker shortage in the U.S.  ... But anyway ...
<br>
<p>Sometimes I'm amazed at what IT workers are paid, but its been that
<br>
way since I started out in the business 25 years ago.  Part of this
<br>
is because good IT people really do make others more productive.
<br>
My first job was in developing applications that computed leveraged
<br>
leasing funding analysis that it would have taken a dozens of human
<br>
'calculators' to do by hand.  In these cases it doesn't matter what
<br>
you pay IT workers so long as its less than you would have to pay
<br>
to have it done some other way.  There is also the aspect that
<br>
programming is so &quot;cold and dry&quot; that sufficient people do not
<br>
enter the field to create an oversupply of IT workers.
<br>
<p>Its interesting to consider whether or not the high IT incomes
<br>
for so many years are driving the IT profession into the condition
<br>
the medical profession is in (where there are an excess of M.D.s).
<br>
<p>With M.D.s, the education costs and insurance costs are so high
<br>
that even with an excess of professionals, their rates do not
<br>
decline significantly.  What happens instead is that they branch
<br>
out into non-essential fields (e.g. cosmetic surgery).
<br>
<p>One might wonder if the Y2K fear-mongoring or the VIRUS scares
<br>
(such as I was recently the victim of) are examples of that
<br>
in the IT profession.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; btw, what makes you think that this growth in demand for geeks is a line of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crap? Maybe it's true.
</em><br>
<p>Its interesting to think about it in economic terms.  I've never
<br>
seen a treatment of it in the classical 'freshman' economics
<br>
courses I've taken.  There it is always 'supply' and 'demand'.
<br>
But with the IT profession it may be entirely a 'substitution'
<br>
economy (1 computer replaces lots of bookkeepers) or an 'enabling'
<br>
economy (3 IT professionals and a minicomputer can do something
<br>
that you would never think about doing before because it would
<br>
require a staff of dozens.)
<br>
<p>Interestingly enough the substitution and enabling paradigms
<br>
are likely to increase as the singularity runneth-over-us.
<br>
