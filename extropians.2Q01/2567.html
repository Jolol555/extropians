<p>Even with zero body fat (not recommended, unachievable?) and zero
<br>
ability to eat (though there's always injection), one has reserves
<br>
in muscle and organ tissue.  AFAIK CR animal studies so far have
<br>
shown reduced incidence of disease and improved recovery.
<br>
<p>OTOH, if I were planning a trip to the South Pole I'd definitely
<br>
bulk up.
<br>
<p>Apart from illness, disease, and aging I'd guess accidents, primarily
<br>
car accidents, constitute the largest threat to an individual's
<br>
lifespan.  Bulk seems like it should provide some protection against
<br>
death or disability from accident, though I don't know if the
<br>
statistics uphold such a correlation.  In any case, a much bigger
<br>
payoff probably comes from taking simple precautions, e.g., drive
<br>
a relatively safe car model defensively, avoid involvement with
<br>
organized crime...
<br>
<p>Avoid all accidents and illness, you're still almost certain to
<br>
die before reaching 100.  I think that CR is the only somewhat-proven
<br>
life *extension* mechanism.  Now maybe the big S is coming in a
<br>
few years, rendering any and all long-term health efforts moot.
<br>
Highly, highly speculative at best.  If substantially biological
<br>
humans still dominate in the next century, I'd like to be one of
<br>
them.  CR seems like my best shot, and it's a cheap one at that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; looking for excuses, the not-skinny
</em><br>
<p>As I you've probably read, CR involves consuming fewer calories,
<br>
not losing weight or looking skinny, though those tend to be side
<br>
effects.  After a year or so of moderate CR I've lost almost no
<br>
weight, though I've always been very skinny, ~135lbs., 6'0&quot;.

</em><br>
<p>I'll gladly take healthy wrinkled skin covering a healthy body over
<br>
unhealthy skin covering an unhealthy body -- not that the choice
<br>
is so stark.
