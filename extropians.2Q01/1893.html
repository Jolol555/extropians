******RAY KURZWEIL KICKS OFF EXTRO-5!!!******
<br>
<p><p>Greetings!
<br>
<p>We are extremely pleased to announce that Ray Kurzweil, author of _The Age
<br>
of Spiritual Machines_ and the forthcoming _The Singularity is Near_ will be
<br>
participating in Extro-5!  Ray has gone to great lengths to ensure that we
<br>
will be able to conduct a 2 &amp; 1/2 hour state-of-the-art videoconference on
<br>
the afternoon of Friday, June 15th.
<br>
<p>Ray has agreed to speak for 40 minutes about his forthcoming book.  After
<br>
this, all registrants will have the opportunity to interact with Ray
<br>
Kurzweil through various means, including a lengthy question and answer session.
<br>
<p>This videoconference is tentatively scheduled to begin at 1:00 PM PST on
<br>
Friday, June 15th.  For those of you who have registered but cannot arrive
<br>
by that time, we will soon be creating a method for you to send Ray Kurzweil
<br>
questions that you would like answered.  His responses will be available
<br>
later in the conference.
<br>
<p>In addition to the above, KurzweilAI.net will be an official sponsor of
<br>
Extro-5, and Ray Kurzweil will be providing all of the videoconferencing
<br>
arrangements and necessary personnel.  Ray also plans to have the
<br>
videoconference taped for broadcast on the above website, as well as for
<br>
later in the conference itself!
<br>
<p>So for those of you who have not yet registered for Extro-5, here is one
<br>
more major reason to do so!  To register (and see other confirmed speakers),
<br>
please go to <a href="http://www.extropy.org/ex5/extro5.htm">http://www.extropy.org/ex5/extro5.htm</a> , the official conference
<br>
website.  For any other questions or comments, please feel free to contact
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S.:  For those who have not yet heard, David Friedman and Ronald Bailey 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will also be attending Extro-5.  Check the above website regularly for
