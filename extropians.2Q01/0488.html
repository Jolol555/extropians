<p>I suppose you could think of the last 600 years of human
<br>
history as the leading edge of the Singularity, if you
<br>
wanted, though that's not how this term is usually used
<br>
by Vinge, Yudkowsky, Broderick, and others who have written
<br>
about the event, which they anticipate will occur sometime
<br>
during the first half of the 21st century (barring disaster).
<br>
As envisioned by these writers, the Singularity will be
<br>
such a radical transformation of sentient existence that
<br>
there isn't much that a contemporary human can imagine
<br>
or predict about life beyond that point, even for
<br>
humans who happen to live through it, let alone for the
<br>
nonhuman, or transhuman, intelligences which may become
<br>
possible in the relatively near future, and whose advent
<br>
may precipitate a runaway, inflationary growth of
<br>
technology beyond the &quot;ordinary&quot; exponential growth
<br>
seen today in trends such as Moore's Law.
<br>
<p>Ray Kurzweil (see
<br>
<a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0012.html?printable=1">http://www.kurzweilai.net/articles/art0012.html?printable=1</a> )
<br>
claims that **all** evolutionary processes (beginning
<br>
with the first appearance of life on Earth, though perhaps the
<br>
trend could even be extrapolated all the way back to the Big Bang
<br>
[or earlier -- but that's getting into very speculative cosmology!]) are
<br>
characterized by a growth curve of complexity (the precise
<br>
definition of which remains elusive) with respect to time
<br>
whose order is at least exponential, and perhaps even
<br>
greater than exponential.
<br>
<p>To speak of the advancing complexity of life on Earth
<br>
is not to imply that this effect is homogeneous -- that
<br>
would be obviously incorrect.  In terms of sheer biomass,
<br>
the bacterium is still the most successful form of
<br>
life on this planet, just as it was a billion years ago.
<br>
It's only the outer envelope, the high-water mark of
<br>
information-processing capacity, that has followed
<br>
Kurzweil's exponential curve.
<br>
<p>Similarly, in the domain of human cultural evolution,
<br>
which has outrun the limits of change imposed by biological
<br>
evolution and has thus kept the curve accelerating
<br>
(according to Kurzweil and others), it is the outer
<br>
envelope of technological advance, as carried on
<br>
by the inheritors of the European commercial, scientific,
<br>
and industrial revolution that began 600 years ago, which
<br>
is being tracked by the same exponential curve (according to
<br>
Kurzweil).  In his recent book _Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny_
<br>
( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679442529/qid=984436037/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/104-9323357-7519923">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679442529/qid=984436037/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/104-9323357-7519923</a> )
<br>
Robert Wright argues that while the detail of which particular
<br>
linguistic, political, or geographical region happens to hold sway
<br>
at the leading edge of complexity is subject to the vagaries of
<br>
historical accident, the practical intellectual
<br>
capital accumulated by a faltering civilization or empire has
<br>
always been passed on to a successor which takes its place at the
<br>
forefront of cultural evolution.  A single emperor's xenophobia
<br>
and paranoia may thus have been responsible for the eclipse
<br>
by European culture of the initially more advanced Chinese
<br>
civilization during the past half millennium.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; During colonization of the 1800's don't you think the inhabitants of many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the exploited territories felt like they missed some singularity-like event?
</em><br>
<p>Just as there are biological species that have remained
<br>
unchanged for hundreds of millions of years, there have
<br>
(until recently, anyway) been some human societies that remained
<br>
static and culturally similar to ancestral human groups of
<br>
tens of thousands of years ago, and others whose development
<br>
did not keep pace with those at the far edge of the global
<br>
envelope.  And yes, those unfortunates have suffered terribly
<br>
at the hands of their more technologically-developed
<br>
conspecifics when the bubbles of geographical isolation
<br>
protecting them have been pierced.  For the people in the
<br>
regions of the world that underwent colonization by European
<br>
powers, the initial contact with technologically-superior
<br>
conquerors must have been a confrontation with beings beyond
<br>
the horizon of their imaginations, a visitation by cruel gods.
<br>
<p>The _Economist_ article that you cite, at
<br>
<a href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?Story_id=80730">http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?Story_id=80730</a>
<br>
states:
<br>
&quot;Innovation shows increasing returns to scale, meaning
<br>
that regions with advanced technologies are best placed to
<br>
innovate further. New ideas are typically produced from a
<br>
recombination of existing ideas (in the phrase coined by Martin
<br>
Weitzman), so environments rich in ideas produce chain reactions
<br>
of innovation.&quot;
<br>
Kurzweil calls this the &quot;Law of Accelerating Returns&quot;:
<br>
&quot;Evolution applies positive feedback in that the more capable
<br>
methods resulting from one stage of evolutionary progress are used
<br>
to create the next stage. As a result, the rate of progress of an evolutionary
<br>
process increases exponentially over time. Over time, the &quot;order&quot; of the
<br>
information embedded in the evolutionary process (i.e., the measure of
<br>
how well the information fits a purpose, which in evolution is survival)
<br>
increases...  Technological evolution is another such evolutionary process.&quot;
<br>
Or to paraphrase Luke: them as has, gets.
<br>
<p>The increasing rate of technological change at the edge of the
<br>
envelope also magnifies the gradient between the leading edge and the
<br>
static or more sluggishly changing regions, and to the extent that the
<br>
latter are aware of the disparity, certainly adds to the perception that
<br>
&quot;from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.&quot;
<br>
This is clearly a dire source of political unrest, and unfortunately,
<br>
it is likely to remain so, even if the increasing wealth of the
<br>
industrialized and information-rich parts of the world makes them
<br>
less stingy with foreign aid, as urged by the article in _The
<br>
Economist_.
<br>
<p>I caught the last half of an interesting documentary on the CNBC
<br>
cable channel the other day entitled _Money &amp; Power: The History of
<br>
Business_ (for which a companion book was recently published, see:
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047140053X/qid=984454411/sr=1-2/ref=sc_b_2/105-2001017-6291100">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047140053X/qid=984454411/sr=1-2/ref=sc_b_2/105-2001017-6291100</a> )
<br>
Progressing from the invention of the steam locomotive (which is
<br>
where I switched on) through the transcontinental railroad,
<br>
Standard Oil, Coca-Cola, the Model T, and the movie business
<br>
to Bill Gates and the AOL/Time-Warner merger, the film ended on
<br>
a feel-good note by describing the marvellous results of an
<br>
economic development project in Laos which provided a silk weaver
<br>
there with a Web site through which she can sell her goods
<br>
on the world market (sorry, I don't have the URL), the suggestion
<br>
being that what used to be called the Third World is about
<br>
to be sucked into the global economic vortex by the World-Wide
<br>
Web, and that everybody will get rich and live happily ever after.
<br>
Well, maybe.  While one hears stories about how, in remote
<br>
villages in China, the first things people manage to get
<br>
hold of once they have access to electricity, and ahead of
<br>
what might be considered more important amenities, are
<br>
televisions and VCRs, creating the infrastructure to get
<br>
these people on the Web might take a while (longer than
<br>
some folks on this list think it will take to get to the
<br>
Singularity here in the U.S.!).  Even in this country, it's
<br>
uncertain when cheap, fast, wireless Internet access is going
<br>
to be available to folks on the road, or living outside the
<br>
range of telephone service (see the article at
<br>
<a href="http://www.womansplace.com/quetzal/html/essays/connected.htm">http://www.womansplace.com/quetzal/html/essays/connected.htm</a> )
<br>
<p>In any case, barring catastrophe, the technological leading edge seems
<br>
likely to remain with European and European-derived cultures (though
<br>
it wasn't so long ago that lots of people expected the torch
<br>
to be passed to the Pacific Rim economies -- SF author
<br>
William Gibson certainly wrote _Neuromancer_ and its sequels
<br>
with that expectation back in the mid-80's, and the 1982 film
<br>
_Blade Runner_ took that line, too).  I did read a
<br>
rather strange SF novel a couple of years ago, _The Fortunate
<br>
Fall_ by Raphael Carter
<br>
( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312863276/qid=984457013/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/104-5803410-6767955">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312863276/qid=984457013/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/104-5803410-6767955</a> )
<br>
which imagines that the Northern Hemisphere has suffered
<br>
setbacks which permit Africa to take the lead and achieve
<br>
Singularity (the story is set in a recovering Eurasia, North
<br>
America is a shambles, and Africa is cordoned off and populated
<br>
by mysterious transhuman entities).  That almost seems like
<br>
mockery, given the sorry state of that continent today
<br>
(by First World standards).  An irreverent, politically
<br>
incorrect (and potentially offensive, depending on your
<br>
politics) economic tour of various places around the globe
<br>
(including Tanzania, and Hong Kong -- which definitely
<br>
sounds like something out of a William Gibson novel) is provided
<br>
by P. J. O'Rourke's _Eat the Rich_
<br>
( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0871137607/qid=984457370/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/104-5803410-6767955">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0871137607/qid=984457370/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/104-5803410-6767955</a> )
<br>
<p>If the Singularity turns out to be benign (from a human perspective),
<br>
and permits human beings who so desire to merge with the stuff of
<br>
nonbiological intelligence, as Ray Kurzweil describes in _The Age of Spiritual
<br>
Machines_, and as also imagined by SF author Greg Egan in _Diaspora_
<br>
( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061057983/qid=984460272/sr=1-4/ref=sc_b_4/104-5803410-6767955">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061057983/qid=984460272/sr=1-4/ref=sc_b_4/104-5803410-6767955</a> )
<br>
then it may be that the only people who are left behind will
<br>
be the ones who stay behind voluntarily (like Egan's &quot;fleshers&quot;)
<br>
or who voluntarily limit the degree of their transformation (like
<br>
the &quot;gleisners&quot;).  Nevertheless, both in Kurzweil's more recent
<br>
scenarios (in which reverse-engineered human brains are reinstantiated
<br>
in physical hardware that is both enormously faster and not limited
<br>
in complexity to what will fit inside a human skull), and in Egan's scenario
<br>
in _Diaspora_, in which the polis-dwellers are living at a subjective
<br>
rate 1000 times faster than the fleshers, the first entities to
<br>
inhabit this new realm of speed and complexity will race far beyond
<br>
those still trapped in biological bodies, creating a cultural
<br>
rift greater than anything yet seen in human history.  The
<br>
initial choices of who goes and who stays behind may be
<br>
irrevocable for that reason.  It's hard to imagine how an
<br>
unenhanced human could catch up to a transcendent culture a
<br>
year or 10 years after the Singularity, without having to undergo
<br>
such a radical transformation in so short a period of time that
<br>
it would constitute a de facto form of death.  On the other
<br>
hand, maybe there won't be just one Singularity, but several,
<br>
like concentric shells of expanding gas being ejected by an
<br>
exploding star, as successive waves of human populations
<br>
transcend.  But the earlier shells may remain forever out
<br>
of reach of the later.
