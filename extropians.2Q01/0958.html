<p>I find this exceedingly hideous.  Your world/universe/whatever and what
<br>
you think of it and yourself does not make you happy or bores you so you
<br>
propose to invent or buy a drug to make you feel better without any
<br>
necessity for self-examination and possible change?  I have friends who
<br>
take some of these anti-depressants.  I have watched many of them have
<br>
their creativity and a large part of their joy flattened in order to
<br>
have a even-tempered ok-ness take its place.  I cannot speak for all
<br>
people of course but I am not at all sure in many cases that this is a
<br>
wise thing to do.  Nor do I believe that the answer to the possibility
<br>
of eternal boredom is simply to engineer the experience away!
