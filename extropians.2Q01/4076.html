<em>&gt;&gt; Here is another data point.  What I know about the controversy

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I had thought, from the remarks there, that more anthropologists

<em>&gt;Don't trust CSICOP.
</em><br>
<p>Fifteen years ago, I trusted them completely.  I expected that
<br>
if and when any extraordinary claim were verified, they'd be
<br>
the first to acknowledge it.  Which is silly, of course.
<br>
<p>They are engaged in a war.  They see the rising tide of
<br>
pseudo-scientific crap as potentially disasterous for our
<br>
society, and I agree with them.  They don't focus on
<br>
esoteric matters such as &quot;the Mars effect&quot;, except when
<br>
it can be used to illustrate wrong-headed or fraudulent
<br>
pseudo-science.  For those unbiased souls who wish for an
<br>
even-handed analysis of, say, astrology, the Skeptical
<br>
Inquirer is not the magazine to read.
<br>
<p>For what they do, and for what they're good at, I cherish
<br>
them still.
<br>
<p>About my data point:  they presented both sides of the Freeman-
<br>
Mead controversy, mostly in articles by Freeman and counter-
<br>
articles by Mead's supporters.  I know their political bias,
<br>
and if Ben is right (that not so many anthropologists and
<br>
sociologists still follow Mead), then they indeed could be
<br>
responsible for the impression that I got.
<br>
<p>On the whole, however, they do a pretty good job suppressing
<br>
their political bias,  which emerges much more clearly in their
<br>
sister publication, &quot;Free Inquiry&quot;.

<p><em>&gt;I think the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that we live in an unmagical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universe, but I no longer consider CSICOP a valid source of evidence for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that proposition.  Basically, they stepped over the line and co-founder
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dennis Rawlins eventually blew the whistle on them.  The summary page that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I usually refer people to appears to be down, but here's the link anyway:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="ftp://ftp.primenet.com/pub/lippard/jjl-on-mars-effect">ftp://ftp.primenet.com/pub/lippard/jjl-on-mars-effect</a>
</em><br>
<p>[ YES,  IT IS STILL DOWN ]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Try looking for Dennis Rawlins's &quot;sTARBABY&quot; and Philip Klass's &quot;CRYBABY&quot;;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having read through both, and Jim Lippard's summary, I think it's pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clear that, while neither side is angelic, Rawlins's basic accusations are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unrefuted and that CSICOP is guilty as charged.  The lesson I'd draw is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you can have a Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the Paranormal, and a Committee for the Skeptical Investigation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Claims of the Paranormal, but they shouldn't be the same organization.
