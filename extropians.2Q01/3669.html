<em>&gt; I was referring to the time when I read Elaine Rich,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hofstadter and Minsky, and all kinds of weird AI journals, and believed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their approach was not sterile. This was about 15 years ago. Then I got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bad case of cellular automata, complexity, resulting in processing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lots of dead tree labeled with Fredkin, Toffioli, Holland, Koza, Kauffman,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wolfram, and their illustrous ilk. I still haven't recovered yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm looking for other infections material, but so far haven't found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much. Maybe I've become immune, that would be a pity.
</em><br>
<p>The GOFAI approach based on pure logic has been pretty much proven sterile,
<br>
although there have been a few successes, such as (&quot;statistical&quot;) machine
<br>
learning, constraint logic programming.
<br>
<p>Although we express our ideas in a serial, 'logical' way, we don't internally
<br>
think this way. Our thinking is fuzzy, continuous. But to communicate, it's
<br>
necessary to provide a baseline that most can understand and that can be
<br>
comunicated easily and reliably.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, evolutionary programming approaches currently suffer because
<br>
of a variant of the &quot;gravel-and-bare-hands&quot; problem. GA and SA are appopriate
<br>
for optimizing and tweaking an existing approximate solution, but not for
<br>
solving a hard problem from scratch. For successful hill-climbing evolution, you
<br>
need a smooth yet uneven &quot;fitness&quot; surface. For a course of development to be
<br>
taken by evolution, almost immediate fitness rewards are needed. Dawkins'
<br>
Climbing Mount Improbable book has a most beautiful depiction of how gradually
<br>
evolution works in nature, and in what ways it is limited.
<br>
<p>Basically, the &quot;invention&quot; of a photo-sensitive cell is very hard (it only
<br>
happened a few times in the past billion years, regardless of the trillion-fold
<br>
parallelism), the tuning of the optimal number of photosensitive cells is very
<br>
simple. Evolving an oscillator is simple, but evolving a TV set is very hard. We
<br>
don't know how difficult is to evolve planning, association, deliberative
<br>
thought --- but we could provide many hints that would skip an enormous number
<br>
of evolutionary steps. Also, better search methods optimize far more efficiently
<br>
than evolution: if we want to find roots of a polynomial, we would not use
<br>
evolution. Evolution is only appropriate when no search algorithm is known.
<br>
<p>As far as CA's go - I agree that they could well be a vital paradigm - I can't
<br>
imagine perception and spatial thinking without massive fine-grained
<br>
parallelism. And they're more flexible than NN's with predefined rigid
<br>
topologies (which can be easily simulated on CA's). We still have to (let them
<br>
:) figure out what else could they be useful for.
<br>
<p>However, for the concept-level cognition, coarse-grained paralellism is
<br>
sufficient -- with individual processors as basic units of computation. Ben's
<br>
nodes are quite a persuasive paradigm. A WMish network might be in many ways
<br>
preferable to a rigid hierarchical ontology (and ontologies are a holy grail for
<br>
Semantic Web adherents, who will soon be forced to show results --maybe they
<br>
could show them with WM better than they would with, say CYC).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But we don't have kLoCs inside us, nor sequential threads of control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (funny that consciousness should seem to absurdly sequential to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introspection),
</em><br>
<p>I believe the sequentiallity of introspection is due to human languages being
<br>
sequential. Of course, consciousness (along with introspection) and language
<br>
coevolve and cannot be considered separately.
<br>
<p>Best regards,
<br>
