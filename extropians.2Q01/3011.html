<p><em>&gt; So, any suggestions for an improvement in the system?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think one constraint in the current system is that reviewing is unpaid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work, where you at most get some credit if you are known to belong to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reviewers of a well respected journal. Right now the journal system is in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process of change as net publications are emerging and challenging the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional paper journals, so presumably this might be the time to look for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new &quot;business models&quot; for peer review too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am fond of the idea of review boards, groups or reviewers placing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seals of approval (or denial, for that matter) on papers without being tied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to journals. Instead journals publish papers that have been approved by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respected review boards, and the review information might also be available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the net. What remains to be figured out is how to make this profitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the reviewers (so they want to do it) without introducing risks of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biasing them through payment.
</em><br>
<p>Of course,  real money idea future's markets would be a big improvement.
<br>
<p>Double-blind peer review would help prevent biases against unknown individuals
<br>
and institutions.  Costly to implement,  though a few journals attempt to do it.
<br>
<p>Rather than let the editorial staff alone pick reviewers, randomly pick
<br>
reviewers from a pool of people agreeable both to the scientist and the
<br>
publication.
<br>
<p>Introduce meta-moderation--review of the reviewers.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that it is the reader of the paper who most benefits from peer
<br>
review.  I'd like to see much more of the raw data put online so that people can
<br>
judge for themselves if they wish--currently, scientific data and its analysis
<br>
is heavily cleaned up for public presentation.  It'd be nice to have more
<br>
software tools to make it easier for scientists to share data and colloborate
<br>
across distance.  For example, perhaps a &quot;Blogger&quot;-like program, adapted for
<br>
scientists that encourages them to publish daily results + running commentary by
<br>
the scientist/tech doing the work.
<br>
<p>If more of the raw data were available online, people could then pay independent
<br>
reviewers to collect and summarize the latest results.    Instead of being
<br>
forced to accept the review criteria of the journal's editorial staff, the
<br>
reader could select reviewers based on their own preferences--one reader might
<br>
prefer innovation to rigor, and select reviewers accordingly.  New scientists
<br>
would probably pay to have their work reviewed by respected reviewer.
<br>
<p>I'd also like to see the implementation of a  distributed prize system,  a la
<br>
The Wall Street Performer Protocol in my sig.  Scientists would then have an
<br>
incentive to cooperate with each other, share data, and get results out in the
<br>
public as quickly as possible so that they get to win the prize.
