I think the article about the X-33 &amp; X-34 needs to be read carefully.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mr. Stephenson announced the end of the X-33 and X-34 programs when they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failed to qualify for more money in the early rounds of the Space Launch 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Initiative, a five-year, $4.5 billion program begun last year that NASA 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopes will lead to a second- generation rocket to replace the shuttle. NASA 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invested $205 million in the X-34 under a 1996 contract with the Orbital 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sciences Corporation of Dulles, Va., to make a series of supersonic, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air-launched robot craft to test new technologies. Mr. Stephenson said 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rising costs made this project noncompetitive. 
</em><br>
<p>I think you can write this off to an excessively ambitious program and
<br>
new ideas since it began.  The program probably would have been canned last
<br>
fall when the composite fuel tank tests failed had it not been for
<br>
the elections.  They kept it alive as an illusion and let the
<br>
Bush administration take the &quot;blame&quot; (if any) for the hatchet job.
<br>
<p>I'm under the impression that the linear aerospike engine tests are
<br>
*still* being conducted at Stennis, so something may be salvaged
<br>
from the effort.  What you should read carefully is the &quot;five-year
<br>
$4.5 billion program&quot; that was begun under the *Clinton* administration,
<br>
hasn't been axed by the Bush administration (at least to my knowledge).
<br>
<p>So you may see the whole effort re-cast under some new programs without
<br>
the fuel tank, but with the aerospike engine.  Now, if they combine
<br>
that with some more up-to-date concepts like in-air fueling of
<br>
the oxygen tanks at high altitude (liquify in the air over a
<br>
several hour cruise time), then you may see get a decline in launch costs.
<br>
<p>Now, regarding the building of space infrastructure, I don't think
<br>
the self-assembling ideas are what is needed to be moved foward.  The
<br>
development of &quot;self-assembling&quot; matter is very difficult.
<br>
This is ever going to happen if you rely on government for
<br>
it or the Mars society for it -- those visions are simply missing
<br>
or wrong.  The Planetary Society is showing however that it can
<br>
implement &quot;private&quot; efforts into space.  There are several other
<br>
small scale efforts by private groups to get into space.
<br>
<p>What you need are things that capture the imagination of the public
<br>
and are affordable *by* the public.  I can suggest two of these --
<br>
<p>a) An initiative for mounting user-operated telescopes *on* the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space station.  Lots of people can afford 8-12 inch telescopes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and volume production of CCD based cameras is driving the megapixel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;camera costs very low.  What is needed is cut-rate pricing to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send these up to the space station and get them mounted and connected
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the network.  I imagine there are lots of universities and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amateur astronomers that would want to participate in something
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like this.  Once all the space on the space station is used up,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you may still have significant demand to drive the expansion of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the space station (something you currently do not have).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives the astronauts up there a real &quot;job&quot; by turning
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them into telescope installation and maintenance engineers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(rather than overpaid and overqualified laboratory technicians).
<br>
<p>b) Once you figure out how to get &quot;affordable&quot; small-scale public
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;projects into space, promote the idea of micro-scale manufacturing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facilities...  The design of a small scale robotic &quot;refinery&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should not be *that* difficult -- something that weighs 1-10 kg
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the most.  You want some small solar panels, an ion drive,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a communications dish, a CPU and probably a mass-spec based
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refinery system.  You then get people to sign up for the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;mass-production&quot; of thousands of these.  You launch them into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space piggybacked on other flights and send them out to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nearby asteroids where they proceed to &quot;set-down&quot; and start
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refining the materials into 100% pure metals. [The asteroid
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;search surveys are cataloging thousands of these, so you have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plenty of targets to pick from.]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you have access to cheap raw materials in space (avoiding
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the $$$ launch costs [you may be able to refuel your ion drive from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the asteroid]).  You should target asteroids that after a few orbits
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orbits by the Earth or the asteroid come back into positions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such that a relatively simple launch from the asteroid to transfer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;materials back to the ISS is feasible).  If you have 10,000 10 kg
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;satellites returning 1 kg of material per year you can have a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;population growth rate of 10% annually.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once these start returning very pure raw materials at low cost
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the ISS where they can be processed into additional satellites
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA has an incentive for adding an &quot;assembly line&quot; facility to the ISS.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You start simple with a facility that can simply melt and recast aluminium,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then move up to making solar cells, then ion drives, etc.  The high-value
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;added parts (perhaps the IC's for the CPU and radio-telemetry
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are ferried up in batches from the Earth).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make this work, the individuals have to &quot;own&quot; their refineries
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(this seems logical given the &quot;ownership&quot; of current satellites).  This
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has to be extended slightly so that you own the materials you harvest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(this might be a bit tricky -- did NASA &quot;own&quot; the moon rocks?).  Clearly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after paying the child-refinery assembly costs you should &quot;own&quot; the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;largely-space-produced and assembled refineries.  You may need some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interesting spins on liability issues -- if your refinery sets down
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on top of someone elses refinery and damages it you are liable --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that would seem to promote cooperation on public statements of what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you intend to harvest.  Since I believe current U.N. treaties prevent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;claiming&quot; ownership of something in space this might work to your
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advantage by making this all first-come-first-served.  The race
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is then on...
<br>
<p>So what is really missing here is micro-scale refinery satellites.
<br>
Most of the technologies for this exist -- steal the communications
<br>
hardware from the past/future Mars missions, the ion drive exists,
<br>
the solar arrays exist, LLNL has a very small scale mass-spec machine
<br>
that can probably be turned into the refinery.  The software for
<br>
space navigation and semi-autonomous operation exists.
<br>
<p>I don't see any major show stoppers.  What is required is getting
<br>
a dozen or so University groups interested in doing the design and
<br>
testing.  Once that is done, you can get someone like Ball Aerospace
<br>
or Lockheed to do the large-scale manufacturing.  (As PC's have shown
<br>
manufacturing things in bulk makes them cheap).  Then you get the
<br>
Planetary Society to market them to its membership.  You can probably
<br>
get banks and insurance companies to come up with loans and insurance
<br>
policies secured by the value of the materials to be harvested.
<br>
<p>Once it gets going, it becomes self-improving.  You get new operating
<br>
systems for the refineries making them more autonomous, you get
<br>
increased demand for more sophisticated manufacturing facilities
<br>
at the ISS followed by the need to manufacture and assemble
<br>
components on the asteroid (e.g. a refinery returning to an
<br>
asteroid from the ISS could take back 10 refinery CPU-&quot;cores&quot; and
<br>
add onto them the solar panels, communications antenna, and other
<br>
simple things &quot;on-site&quot;.   Once you have eliminated the launch costs,
<br>
consortiums of Space-Refinery pioneers will band together to fund the
<br>
manufacture of space hotels.  By that time, you will probably have mature
<br>
nanotech and so the personal Earth-to-Space travel costs should be minimal.
<br>
<p>The path seems pretty clear to me once you get out of the framework
<br>
of using planetary-based materials.
