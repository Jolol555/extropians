<p><em>&gt; Let me tell you a little secret about the real world (as opposed to the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Capitalism prevails because it allows players to have a real and palpable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stake in the game. That's why the US government encourages citizens to own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own homes. Private ownership stabilizes the system by giving people a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason *not* to riot, rebel, and revolt. Take away private ownership, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people have nothing to lose by burning down the neighborhood (or the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country for that matter). Anarchism is a nice ideal, but it just doesn't pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mortgage, and it never will.
</em><br>
<p>While I've always found anarchism to be compelling as a romantic ideal, it just
<br>
doesn't make it in the world we find ourselves living in. Maybe someday it
<br>
will. Who knows? Even if we don't subscribe to it as an ideology, I think there
<br>
is a lot we can learn from anarchist writers (I like Kropotkin). But then, I
<br>
feel that way about most things, and am not easily converted (I tend to
<br>
assimilate and/or synthesize what I need). For an excellent examination of how
<br>
an anarchist society might actually look (warts and all), I would heartily
<br>
recommend Ursula K. Le Guin's novel THE DISPOSSESSED, which was originally
<br>
published in 1974. I recently reread it after many years, and her critique of
<br>
both anarchism and capitalism still rings true. And it's a great novel (IMHO).
