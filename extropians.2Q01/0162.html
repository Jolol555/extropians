I think you're making my point. The Taliban is NOT representative of Islam,
<br>
though you might think that from the news we get. (Keep in mind the same
<br>
destruction of statues by Christians, and wonder if that is representative
<br>
of the Christians you know.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were discussing how a significant portion of the world's population
<br>
might respond to certain technologies, and how we might find out what their
<br>
thoughts are. I simply made a point about politeness, and then get
<br>
responses based on things I didn't say, and on misperceptions based on
<br>
faulty reporting. You don't have to agree with their religion to understand
<br>
the power they have. You might think Islam is primitive but telling Muslims
<br>
that, while discussing how they feel about technology would certainly stop
<br>
the conversation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technologies needed to fulfill the things most extropians want
<br>
(life-extension, AI, etc.) are VERY controversial, and are constantly being
<br>
threatened with being made illegal. Countering those threats will take an
<br>
effort, and some of the things people have been saying seem more aimed at
<br>
making sure NO ONE listens to us.

<p>Theology is anti-science, and in general we *should* be against
<br>
supernaturalism, and try to reduce by natural theories where
<br>
possible. Engage them in argument, and even evangelise if that
<br>
is necessary to counter their pulpit propaganda.
<br>
<p>I am completely appalled by image on TV of TALIBAN muslims
<br>
destroying the immense ancient Buddha statues. This vandalism
<br>
is inexusable, and shows the bigotry and bankruptcy of the ideology
<br>
of primitive human-era Islam which drives them.
