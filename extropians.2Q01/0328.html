</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Group B typically has only one way to counter: fight back. (If they don't,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group A has achieved their objective, and you have failed.) By fighting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back, group B mirrors the process undertaken by group A: they progressively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threaten to destroy, and then actually destroy, something group A holds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value, until group A ceases to fight back.
</em><br>
<p>This theory is completely demolished by the last 80 years of history,
<br>
and the last twenty in particular, unless you count ideas like
<br>
'totalitarianism', 'dictatorship', and 'militarism' to be 'something of
<br>
value'. I, and I would guess most people consider those ideas to be of
<br>
little or no value, even most people who used to live under such
<br>
systems.
<br>
<p>Things like 'communism' and 'socialism' have not been 'destroyed', they
<br>
are sadly alive and well around the world, making life worse for
<br>
billions of people, and will continue to be as long as we all believe
<br>
that freedom means the right to be as stupid as you want to be. The cold
<br>
war was not a conflict, really, between communism and free markets, but
<br>
between a statist mercantilism and a mercantilist statism. One used a
<br>
fascist dictatorship to govern, the other used an open participatory
<br>
republic to govern. The first used 'communism' as its propaganda dogma,
<br>
the other used 'free market capitalism' as its propaganda dogma. Neither
<br>
nation came anywhere near achieving either state, though it seems that
<br>
we now, in a state of peace, are more likely to achieve both (which will
<br>
turn out to be very similar to each other with a few important
<br>
differences).
<br>
<p>The conflict was essentially about how one is to attain one's own
<br>
utopia: by reaching consensus voluntarily with like minded individuals,
<br>
or by force of arms, propaganda, lies, theft, and betrayal. Making
<br>
everybody play nice, among humans, only seems to occur when some big
<br>
Ju-Ju sort of deity holds the threat of damnation and hellfire. Absent
<br>
belief in such a deity, the threat of nuclear destruction of everybody
<br>
seems to work sufficiently well as a substitute. Most people
<br>
subconciously understand this, and nuclear weapons will be eliminated as
<br>
a threat when enough people have grown up enough to handle power
<br>
responsibly.
<br>
<p>Because that is essentially the problem: Individual humans have evolved
<br>
well to be able to handle their individual liberties quite reponsibly,
<br>
it is only when you give them more power than an individual normally has
<br>
that you tend to get problems with corruption. We can each be trusted
<br>
generally to take care of ourselves, it is only when we are taking care
<br>
of others that there needs to be controls in place until humans properly
<br>
learn to handle such responsibility. Many people do do so quite well,
<br>
but many also do not.
<br>
<p>The proper place for armed robots is as nannies for elected and
<br>
appointed officials (of both public and private nature) who have power
<br>
over individual citizens of one sort or another, not to protect those
<br>
officials, but to make them behave.
