<p><em>&gt;&gt;&quot;The plain truth, quoting FDA Commissioner Jane Henney, is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;'biotech products have produced no evidence of food safety risks:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not one rash, not one sore throat, not one headache.'
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm wondering if there are problems that have not been recognized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yet, in fact I have a candidate, GERD. I had never even heard of it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a few years ago (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease) and am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surrounded by people who seem to be diagnosed with it on a regular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basis. I know dozens of people on medication for it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've had every test you can imagine, and they can't find a cause.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since it's not immediately life threatening, and is controllable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with medication/diet/exercise there doesn't seem to be a rush to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find an answer. Yet there is an &quot;outbreak&quot; in the growing number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;new cases, and this just in the last couple of years.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;outbreak&quot; of GERD is due to having expensive new drugs to treat it.  
<br>
You've heard of it before when it was called &quot;heartburn&quot;.  Hard to
<br>
get insurers to pony up for that :-)
