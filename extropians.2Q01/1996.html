I thought he had a frighteningly valid argument for the curtailment 
<br>
of First Amendment rights. When I'd heard before that he was in favor 
<br>
of restricting free speech, I thought the guy had gone over the edge, 
<br>
become fringe, was marginalizing himself, etc.--but when I heard it 
<br>
in his own words...scary stuff. 
<br>
<p>Thanks to Russell for the heads-up on the broadcast.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bill Joy's talk with Katrina of Wired on April 5 2001 on CNET Radio:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To talk about/criticize this subject you have to accept the underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not an all or not type issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most people responding fall into two groups: either they deny it will happen, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are fatalistic and say there is nothing you can do about it (Newt says we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go faster than our enemies).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He wants a hypocratic oath from scientists in these areas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He thinks since there is a chance of total destruction/suffering, that is enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to relinquish pursuits of these areas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He felt like he got a low response to his article from the technology community.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He feels due to pace of modern companies, there is not time to discuss these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He fears the schizos doing something irreversible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...so far all the talk has been about biological threats (30 minutes into it)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He thinks the odds are better than 50/50 that we survive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He's surprised people are still reading the Wired article.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He isn't worried about human-sized robots, but more nanotech or other &quot;foraging&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robots.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stressing again that you have to balance expected future tech pluses versus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering caused by misuse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolution has not prepared us for the scenario we are facing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Questions from the audience:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you reconcile relinquishment with civic rights to innovation? He says 1st
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amendment isn't important since many countries function ok without it. He really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't have an answer to this...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How is the realm of forbidden knowledge going to be defined? He thinks we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk to the humanities folks (joking?). What he really fears is democratized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to advanced tech. No real answer here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turning over control to AI because of complexity... this is not Bill Joy's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concern,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is Kaczynski's.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Example of technology that was relinquished or regulated? People argued against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the H-bomb... we decided not to do bioweapons, but Russians cheated. Besides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has no answers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's your strategy to affect behavior of government/business? He is writing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to explain it to laymen, and present examples of potential problems. He doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it gets politicized.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How will information get into the real world? People will have advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;printing&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devices that will be able to produce things... biotech labs-at-home-on-a-chip.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does he worry about this stuff in his real world job? He works on reliable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thinks reliable software is mainly needed by the &quot;good guys&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we are not the end of evolution, shouldn't we hope that the next species will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nice to us? He thinks we evolve so slowly (genetically) that the only way this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen is to explicity try to create a new species. He thinks we all should get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vote before allowing this.
