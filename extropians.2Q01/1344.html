</em><br>
<p>Just keep the sail in service- unloaded, it could get back to 2000 km
<br>
earth orbit rather quickly to pick up another payload.  Since the
<br>
delta-V of sails are unlimited, they should be treated as slow cargo
<br>
haulers, not expendable ammunition.  A dozen round trips in thirty years
<br>
would be good utilization.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Would it make economic sense to send them back to Earth to receive new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cargos (I guess they are not that useful for transporting propellant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or other heavy products from the asteroid)?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the sail could deliver a large payload from the asteroid to an
<br>
aerocapture trajectory, then drop it off and change course before the
<br>
encounter.  Often the delta-V to go from asteroid to simply
<br>
earth-crossing is quite modest, and the mass throughput can be high. 
<br>
The payload must be able to aerocapture, though.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Another use would be for the aerobraking part of the mission, where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fuel tanks are aerobraked for entry into LEO. The sails are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely too flimsy to survive aerobraking in themselves, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder if they might help provide some extra drag during the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pass. Any views on this?
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  To aerocapture, one must shed enough energy on one pass to go
<br>
from hyperbolic to elliptical.  This typically requires several km/s in
<br>
a few hundred seconds and hits several gees.  A sail would be destroyed
<br>
instantly and uselessly- consider a parachute made of conventional
<br>
aluminum foil tossed into a jet engine exhaust.  Confetti.
<br>
<p>A note of terminology- aerobraking assumes that the vehicle is already
<br>
in an elliptical orbit about the planet, and can use many pure-drag
<br>
passes at low acceleration to lower the apogee.  Forces and heating
<br>
rates are low.  Aerocapture converts a hyperbolic approach into a
<br>
captured orbit, with large forces, heating similar to atmosphere entry,
<br>
and needs significant hypersonic lift to do a pullup once the correct
<br>
amount of energy is dissipated.  If the pullout is not done, the capture
<br>
could turn into a landing inadvertently, producing expensive fireworks
<br>
displays.
<br>
<p>Aerocapturing thousand-ton payloads into earth orbit would be
<br>
politically difficult; witness the angst and hand wringing over
<br>
yesterday's Mir reentry of only a few hundred tons.  A thousand tons of
<br>
propellant tanks would go over like... forgive me... a lead balloon.
