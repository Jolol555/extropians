I mustn't let the simulation discussion end without mentioning
<br>
the _ST: TNG_ episode &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot;, written by Rene Eschevarria
<br>
and starring Daniel Davis (who also portrays Niles the butler in
<br>
the television show _The Nanny_) as Professor Moriarty.

<br>
<p>This was a continuation of the earlier episode &quot;Elementary, My
<br>
Dear Data&quot; in which the holodeck simulation of Professor Moriarty,
<br>
whom Commander Data has enhanced to be a worthy opponent in
<br>
his role-playing adventures as Sherlock Holmes, becomes self
<br>
aware.
<br>
<p>&quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; contains some entertaining plot turns
<br>
based on multiple levels of virtual reality, and the end
<br>
gives a final twist which wouldn't astonish anyone
<br>
on this list, but which must have seemed like pretty advanced
<br>
stuff for a mass TV audience.
<br>
<p>The most striking thing about this episode, though, is that
<br>
it is one of the most egregious examples of a radical
<br>
disconnect between an advanced technology with rather breathtaking
<br>
implications, and the comparatively mundane world of Star Fleet
<br>
and the Federation.  Clearly, the writers were straining
<br>
against the walls of the box.
<br>
<p>One could also mention _The Inner Light_ as an example of an
<br>
episode based on a kind of simulated reality (in any case it's held by
<br>
many fans to be the best _TNG_ episode of them all):
<br>
<a href="http://www.startrek.about.com/tvradio/startrek/library/weekly/aa032000.htm">http://www.startrek.about.com/tvradio/startrek/library/weekly/aa032000.htm</a>
<br>
This isn't really a simulation in the sense being discussed
<br>
here, because it doesn't take place inside a computer; instead,
<br>
the virtual reality is induced in Picard's mind.
<br>
He experiences this induced state as reality, not as a dream, and an
<br>
entire lifetime in an alternate existence is packed into a few
<br>
minutes of Enterprise ship time, which he remembers completely
<br>
after waking up.  It's a very poignant and
<br>
moving episode.
<br>
<p>I'm sure other examples could be cited from the _Deep Space Nine_ and
<br>
_Voyager_ repertoires, but since I'm not as well versed in the later
<br>
shows, I'll pass over them in silence ;-&gt;.
