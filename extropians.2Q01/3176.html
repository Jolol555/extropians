Well then, they have this stuff called jarndyce law.  So, because it
<br>
covers such a wide range of issues, many points may be addressed
<br>
consecutively, and there are always more.
<br>
<p>Basically, there can be public meetings about anything.  Sometimes it
<br>
depends on who wants to know, and why, or people want to think it that
<br>
way.
<br>
<p>For example, I normally would want the same information that various
<br>
forms of local authorities have about myself only, but not other people,
<br>
for them not being my business.  What that means in terms of freedom of
<br>
information is that they do not have privy to copyrights actually
<br>
involving personal identity.  So, I think the law should be that you
<br>
should be able to ask some organization that tracks personal information
<br>
if it has information upon you or where its sole provider of information
<br>
upon you is, and to what levels they have access, where one simple
<br>
request for your own or your dependents' personal information store's
<br>
possible presense and its extent would be regular practice to actually
<br>
receive that information readily, and the complete extent of local,
<br>
personal information readily.  Normally, that would only be a line in the
<br>
password file, yet it is not the case, because computers log by default.
<br>
So, it might be some lines in a flat file or lines from a database table,
<br>
those kinds of things.  When they have more trust, then providers can be
<br>
certified to keep personal information private.  And, our personal
<br>
computers are configurable by us, ourselves.
<br>
<p>For example, each car has a license and registration, because there are
<br>
some legitimate public safety concerns about automobiles on the roads.
<br>
In the past, that meant witnesses would be able to identify some cars by
<br>
their licenses.  Today, using the Internet, local radio, and PCs, the
<br>
officers on the road have wireless access to the license and registratoin
<br>
information on vehicles.  By the same token, people can actually listen
<br>
to the radio on their scanner, because it's the actual public city's
<br>
radio.
<br>
<p>So, I haven't looked at this treaty, let's see what it says.  Here, on
<br>
the first page, it says this:  &quot;Please note that this page contains only
<br>
a selection of declassified texts. &quot;  Then it says:  &quot;Draft Convention on
<br>
Cyber-crime (Version No. 25)
<br>
This text has been declassified after the last Plenary meeting of
<br>
Committee PC-CY, held  n Strasbourg, from 11 to 15 December 2000. This
<br>
text has also been submitted to the Parliamentary Assembly for opinion,
<br>
which is expected to give its opinion in April 2001. In the light of this
<br>
opinion, the text will be subject to a further revision by the European
<br>
Committee on Crime Problems (CDPC), which is then expected to approve it
<br>
at its next Plenary session in June 2001. The text then will be submitted
<br>
to the Committee of  Ministers for adoption.&quot;
<br>
<p>We might want to know who these actual people are, if they get a say, or
<br>
not.

<p>Have a nice day,
