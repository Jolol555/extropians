<em>&gt; Right, yes, of course.  That was my point.  Answering the qualia

dead,
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fine, fine.  But (and this was my point) what does it *matter*, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're making the same choice as someone who *did* think that they

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that this philosophical distinction changes nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than what we *call* this scenario (self-preservation/altruism)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how we'll feel about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, with that said, maybe that's reason enough to say that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters.  But *that* question feels pretty trivial, at least to me.
</em><br>
<p>I think these points of view are not equivalent. Particularly, I think there
<br>
are more moderate scenarios (give up the rest of your life even though you
<br>
are healthy, to let an upload live instead), in which behaviour is not
<br>
equivalent. If I though it would be *me* going into the machine, I'd go for
<br>
it (selfish), but if I thought it would be someone like me who is not me;
<br>
they can bite me (altruism, or lack of). So it is not clear that we would
<br>
choose destructive upload whether identically, given different motives.
<br>
<p>For example, if I thought there was a way to reliably get into silicon right
<br>
now, which involved destruction of my body, I'd do it.
