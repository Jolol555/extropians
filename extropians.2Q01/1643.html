I would be very happy if someone could prove me wrong, or explain this in

another way, or do something to make this notion of
<br>
happiness-as-a-mere-chemical go away. But it seems that people are treating
<br>
the most delicate cases of unhapiness (the suicidal) with this notion of
<br>
chemical disorder, which, I must say, doesn't look that much encouraging...
<br>
I'm asking you to look at this as the transhumanists you strive to be, and
<br>
not as the humane people you might be.

<p>I guess the &gt;H position would be that
 - we want to be able to control emotions (we are control freaks), and using
drugs is just fine for that (although the inelegance of most examples is
irksome)
 - Killing oneself is not a Transhuman ideal, except perhaps if you've lived
10K+ years and are getting bored. Keeping people alive through what is
likely a transitory phase is a Good Thing (tm).
- Humans are mere chemicals. I'm made of mere chemicals, which in turn are
just boring old atoms, and those in turn quarks (oh the banality).
- Happiness is not the supreme state for extropians, in particular.  I would
expect that (unattainable) fulfillment is. None of the extropian principles
would require happiness; in many cases, the drive required to reach them
comes from massive discontent coupled with optimism; not happiness.
Realising one's dreams could involve the full range of &quot;negative&quot; emotions,
and potentially end in great sadness. Happiness is cows in green pastures,
and we like to think that we are not they.
