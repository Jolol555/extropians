<p>
<em>&gt; More seriously, you have an implicit assumption here that survival of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species, or survival of intelligent life, or some otherwise defined class,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is our &quot;supergoal&quot; (to borrow some jargon). Many here would argue that this
</em><br>
<p>I was referring to the most fundamental class, namely life. It's perhaps the
<br>
only one which is not abstract.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; is fundamentally at odds with extropianism, which has a more individualistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outlook... we would save ourselves, at the cost of the long term good of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species perhaps. Although it is not at all clear that this is a required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tradeoff.
</em><br>
<p>Individualism and selfishness are just other evolved heuristics. Can you
<br>
transcend your &quot;naturally selected&quot; impulses and comprehend with the mind alone?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the point that you are wanting to make is that natural selection is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more efficient than the alternative, whatever that may be. I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's necessarily so. The idea of becoming transhuman is that we can shape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves as we see fit, and as is best to meet the challenges of our
</em><br>
<p>We are already not subject solely to natural selection. For example, if you like
<br>
green eyes, you will choose a partner with green eyes, and a certain proportion
<br>
of your offspring will have green eyes. You don't have to wait for a random
<br>
mutation. You just pick it off the shelf, be that reason or impulse, and mix it
<br>
in your own genomic stew. It's Lamarckism, just that the iteration is a
<br>
generation, and that the scalpel is a bit blunt. Surely we'll fix that.
<br>
<p>But my point is not to exemplify natural selection, as I have stressed before. I
<br>
agree with most of your objections to it. I'm just pointing out that design and
<br>
selection, without exploration, is dangerous.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
