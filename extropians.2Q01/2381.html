&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes you think I haven't done this yet?  Unlike the majority of you 
<br>
here, I am not a scientific researcher.  In point of fact, I am still in 
<br>
college.   As a result, it makes it sort of hard for me to publish or get out 
<br>
any sort of word on this and be taken seriously by the media that is at my 
<br>
access, which is not a whole lot other than literary magazines.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I subscribed to this list because I care about the future and I knew that 
<br>
there *would* be people on it that have access and can get word to alot of 
<br>
things that I can't.    But I have to point out the negatives involved in 
<br>
technology, because every Extropian site I've been to, to me, sees the future 
<br>
with rather rose-tinted glasses.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That and since some of you are actually robotics and neurbiology 
<br>
researchers rather than just avid sci-fi fans like me,  I figure that you 
<br>
guys will be able to deal with the specifics of things, rather than just 
<br>
general concepts, which is about all I can do.
