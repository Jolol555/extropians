I think you're on to something here.
<br>
<p>Perhaps his jetwash got too close to the underside of the port wing, or maybe the flow around his airframe and wing
<br>
complicated the EP-3 wing airflow or even stalled it. There's also the &quot;biplane suck&quot; effect where two airfoils in close
<br>
vertical proximity can see enough lower pressure between them that they tend to collide. 
<br>
<p>Some of this stuff could have looked to an unprepared observer like a turn or bank, but without the associated control
<br>
surface movement.
<br>
<p>It can be devilishly hard to reconstruct this sort of stuff to the satisfaction of all parties. But for sure, a change
<br>
in lift that could produce, say, a nominal 500 fpm change in altitude would be most inconvenient at a distance of a
<br>
couple of feet.
