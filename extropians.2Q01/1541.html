<p>Damien, see my response to Lee for a discussion of some of this.
<br>
To answer your question properly you have to state whether you
<br>
are running the zombies in the 'real' world or in the simulation.
<br>
<p>In a simulation it doesn't matter because you slow down the
<br>
'conscious' being sufficiently for the zombies lookups to succeed.
<br>
<p>In the 'real' world, the question is how much memory can you
<br>
put in the brain or how far an encoded radio transmission
<br>
can go in the granularity of human attention (~0.01 sec probably).
<br>
So if light travels a foot a nanosecond, then you have 10^7 feet
<br>
divided by 2 (if you want a bidirectional transmission).
<br>
<p>So you can communicate out-of-body for the lookup over hundreds
<br>
or perhaps thousands of miles.  If you have to keep it within
<br>
the body, you've can fit several times Avagardo's number of atoms
<br>
within your brain casing -- that is *a lot* of memory.  If its
<br>
a complete nanotech zombie, you can add most of the rest of the body
<br>
as available memory.  Don't quote me on this but I'd guess you
<br>
are pushing 10^28 bits in theory.  If you can encode the memories in
<br>
electron spin states or energy levels its going to go even
<br>
higher.  Compare that with the &quot;recall&quot; memory of humans of
<br>
less than 10^9 bits (&quot;recognition&quot; memory may be higher).
<br>
So you can *theoretically* have walking around a lookup table
<br>
of human memories of 10^19 bits.  Now how you translate that
<br>
really big number into the bits or patterns required to
<br>
determine 'behaviors' I don't know.
<br>
<p>I think you would want to think about how long it takes you
<br>
to 'learn' specific patterns (throwing a ball, driving a
<br>
car, putting words together creatively, etc.  Then take
<br>
that time as a fraction of the total human recall capacity
<br>
and assume that is the 'behavior' bit requirement.  Obviously
<br>
there is a large amplification that is occuring when you
<br>
take a small behavioral bit pattern and &quot;manifest&quot; it in
<br>
reality.
<br>
<p>The recall times can be *very* fast for the reasons I mention
<br>
in the response to Lee.  Whole branches of computer science
<br>
are based on concepts of data caches, locality of reference,
<br>
organizing it hierarchically, multiple simultaneous accesses,
<br>
etc.  We know how to organize this stuff.  For example ram
<br>
memory access times are now I would guess around 10 nanoseconds.
<br>
Disks a few 10s of millisecconds.  Add a few nanoseconds
<br>
for routing the data through the body.  Its very fast.
<br>
Much faster than the &quot;frame rate&quot; for human attention.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, this possibility seems to me to fall over dead in just the way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Skinner's behaviorism did when famously assailed by Chomsky (and wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there an exchange along these lines just a few weeks ago? what a shame I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't look up the table and find out).
</em><br>
<p>Could you elaborate on this a bit further?  I'm not connecting
<br>
the references and the discussion.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Robert
