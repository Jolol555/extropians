<em>&gt; If enough Americans were to decide to stop buying Chinese goods, the effect

</em><br>
<em>&gt; President, and equally tragic: it would cut off the flow of oxygen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; China's economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since reforms first began, haltingly in 1978, the pattern in China has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that in times of strong economic growth, liberals in the government such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Premier Zhu Rongzi have managed to hold a lot of clout, and be successful in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pushing through further liberal, capitalist reforms.  The process builds on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, in times of economic stagnation or crisis with the West (such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the aftermath of the embassy bombing in Belgrade, for example, not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mention the current problems in Hainan Province) the anti-progress Communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardliners in government tend to gain ground, and criticism of the liberals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes louder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's always hard to predict the future, but as far as I can tell, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects of a large-scale boycott of Chinese-made goods would have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primary effect of slowing or even reversing the liberal, pro-freedom trend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in China (there would be other negative effects, but again, I'm keeping this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant to the thread).
</em><br>
<p>The problem with this is that:
<br>
<p>a) all attempts at unionizing in China are in fact brutally repressed.
<br>
b) reform groups (like Falun Gong) are brutally repressed.
<br>
c) there is NO opposition political group permitted to exist in China.
<br>
d) nobody in the public sees much of the prison labor system.
<br>
e) the Chinese people know quite well what the punishment is for not
<br>
parroting the party line. Even here in the US, Chinese citizens who are
<br>
living here in the US were very very hard to find who would voluntarily
<br>
go on US television to comment on a Chinese perspective. Several US tv
<br>
journalists have commented that most everyone they asked reacted with
<br>
outright fear at the idea. I am not surprised at all that your friend
<br>
found nobody who was not ecstatically happy with the current regieme.
<br>
Prisoners are always quite happy with the most brutal wardens. Just ask
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>While the 'temptation island' model of 'engagement' that has been used
<br>
with the Chinese has produced zero real reforms politically, while much
<br>
economic reform has occured. The system there is very much the sort of
<br>
'state capitalism' that western 'anarchists' claim the Soviet Union was.
<br>
What we do know is that isolation and economic embargo works. It worked
<br>
with the Soviets and the rest of the Warsaw Pact nations. It hasn't
<br>
worked well with Cuba because several key nations ignore the US embargo,
<br>
esp. Mexico and Spain.
<br>
<p>As someone else said, the difference between communism and capitalism is
<br>
that with one, man exploits man, while the other is the reverse. What
<br>
capitalism has as an advantage is that it PERMITS the possibility of a
<br>
tolerant and open moral and ethical society to evolve and exist IF the
<br>
culture it exists in allows such a thing. China is heavily Confucian in
<br>
its cultural make up, and as such is quite intolerant and autocratic.
<br>
Thus China is possibly one of the worse nations to try the 'engagement'
<br>
strategy with. They will become capitalistic wizards, while they
<br>
monopolize and enslave markets and people.
