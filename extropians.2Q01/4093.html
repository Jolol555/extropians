<p>Quite so, except that I wouldn't lean too heavily on the &quot;countered
<br>
successfully&quot; part; after having lived for more than a decade
<br>
with somebody who is now a film professor, and who is drenched
<br>
in the culture of academic humanities studies, I would point out
<br>
that the phrase &quot;human nature&quot; is still fightin' words to a lot
<br>
of intellectuals.  Also, would you really care to debate, in person,
<br>
the nature of &quot;human nature&quot; with somebody like Stephen Jay Gould?
<br>
(pardon me, while I find the nearest closet to hide in).
<br>
<p>But apart from whatever scientific influence Mead may have exercised,
<br>
she cut quite a figure in the popular media while she was alive
<br>
(like Dr. Ruth, but with immensely more gravitas).  She wrote newspaper
<br>
articles, and was a formidable presence at speaking engagements,
<br>
with her trademark cape and walking stick.  Also a fearsome
<br>
opponent in debate, I've heard (where was that closet, now?).
<br>
Avatar and sha-womyn of the Goddess, darling role model of the
<br>
feminist movement etc., etc.
