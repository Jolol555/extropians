<p>It is always possible to *DEFINE* some alknowing &quot;God&quot; that would know
<br>
our destiny beforehand (or rather, intemporally).
<br>
But this is utterly irrelevant, in as much as we don't possess the same
<br>
information as God, and must act according to whatever information WE have.
<br>
What's amazing is how this relativity of point of view (which is not quite
<br>
the same as relativism) is completely missed by most people who debate about
<br>
such issues as predestination and determinism, or morality or economics in
<br>
general.

Obviously, a man's judgement cannot be better than the information on which he
<br>
has based it.  Give him the truth and he may still go wrong when he has
<br>
the chance to be right, but give him no news or present him only with distorted
<br>
and incomplete data, with ignorant, sloppy or biased reporting, with propaganda
<br>
and deliberate falsehoods, and you destroy his whole reasoning processes, and
<br>
make him something less than a man.
