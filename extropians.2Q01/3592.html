<em>&gt;&gt; Until somebody demonstrates machine-phase is even *possible*

<p><em>&gt;Have you missed the jack-in-the-box electrostatic

</em><br>
<em>&gt;use van der Waals forces as springs to pull back what you

</em><br>
<p>No, I hadn't heard of buckysprings.  I think it indicates how far we are
<br>
that a spring is cutting-edge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The question is, is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;repertoire of mechanosynthetic reactions sufficiently rich for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;structure to be able to deposit a copy of the structure itself?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Given how much we found poking around so little, the answer seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be a tentative yes.
</em><br>
<p>I think that's very premature, given that we can do *neither* universal,
<br>
nor even broad, mechanosynthesis *and* that all mechanosynthesis
<br>
requires decidedly macro machinery.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But do we need machine-phase self-rep capable nanotechnology? Sure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it would be nifty. But computronium built with self-assembling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;molecular electronics is accessible with classical chemical and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biological means already.
</em><br>
<p>We do need mpsrn for the nanoSanta which will solve all our problems.
<br>
Nifty new computers would be nifty new computers but they won't
<br>
build houses for everybody on earth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;[discussion of various computer techniques snipped]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;None of this will suffice to create naturally intelligent machines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who're smart enough to be able to compete with us.
</em><br>
<p>We have created computers which can do some very limited parts
<br>
of human thoughts, such as voice recognition.  For this reason,
<br>
given Moore's law, I think it's *possible* that human-equivalent
<br>
AI could be created in 20 years or so.  I wouldn't bet the bank on
<br>
it though.  I wouldn't bet the bank *against* it either.
<br>
This differs from proximate nanotech or significantly mentally
<br>
enhanced people, which I would bet the bank against.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;It [an AI singularity] will be like the whole world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is a successful startup company for a few years to a few decades;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; then it will be over.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Ha! MorePolice, arrest this man. He's acting defaetist in public, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his extropian license needs to be revoked.
</em><br>
<p>I know you're joking, but there's nothing defeatist in saying progress
<br>
will go on for some time to come, that we personally won't be
<br>
obsolete in the next few years, or that nanaSanta's not on our
<br>
doorstep.  That's my concept of practical optimism; there are a
<br>
lot of great things under development; things can improve over the
<br>
next 20 years and more after that.  It's counterproductive, however,
<br>
to *expect* very improbable miracles; it'll throw off your discount
<br>
rate.  You'll end up doing suboptimal stuff.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If we had machine-phase nanosynthesis or computers that could 
<br>
write good papers I'd be singing a different tune.  Someday we
<br>
probably will.  But today we don't.
