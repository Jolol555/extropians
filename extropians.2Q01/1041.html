Does Cyborg Conspiracy Threaten Earth?
<br>
<a href="http://www.flatdisk.net/exonews/genetics/clone_conspiracy.htm">http://www.flatdisk.net/exonews/genetics/clone_conspiracy.htm</a>
<br>
&nbsp;In coming years, you'll see astronauts go up to the ISS with
<br>
super-dexterous cyber-companions that will reduce the need for humans to
<br>
take that &quot;small step&quot; beyond the confines of their space ships.
<br>
<p>Unlike smaller robots, the human-sized robots, called Robonauts, can latch
<br>
on to the station and still have two &quot;hands&quot; free for manipulating objects
<br>
and building the station as if it were a Tinkertoy.
<br>
<p>Robonauts, under development by engineers at NASA's Johnson Space Center,
<br>
will be controlled by astronauts inside the station using a virtual
<br>
reality interface -- they'll wear helmets and gloves wired to record their
<br>
motions and immediately transfer those intentions and actions to robots
<br>
outside the station.
<br>
<p>&quot;We're using a humanoid shape to meet NASA's increasing requirements for
<br>
Extravehicular Activity (EVA, or spacewalks),&quot; NASA's Rob Ambrose said in
<br>
a prepared statement. Ambrose is heading up the Robonaut project.
<br>
<p>Doing it better
<br>
<p>The two-armed, two five-fingered Robonauts come with a head and torso.
<br>
Demonstrations in NASA's &quot;Vomit Comet&quot; weightlessness simulator have
<br>
showed a Robonaut neatly catching a fly ball with finesse that might have
<br>
impressed Joe DiMaggio.
<br>
<p>Ever since the dawn of space exploration, hardware has been built so that
<br>
humans could service it. But advances in robotics and the telepresence
<br>
conferred by virtual reality have made it so spacewalking humans are no
<br>
longer a requirement, Ambrose said.
<br>
<p>&quot;While the depth and breadth of human performance is beyond the current
<br>
state of the art in robotics,&quot; he said, &quot;NASA targeted the reduced
<br>
dexterity and performance of a suited astronaut as Robonaut's design
<br>
goals, specifically using the work envelope, ranges of motion, strength
<br>
and endurance capabilities of spacewalking humans.&quot;
