<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;Although the Timeship would not be as good for cryonics as $100 M pumped 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;into research, it might do the trick anyway. These people are very much 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;interested in making cryonics work, and one way is as good as another. So if 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;we can get the funding, I say let's build the temple, and develop a pseudo 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;religion, if need be; and the money from dues will come in, and we can spend 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; &gt;that on research. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;I think there is a fundamental difference in viewpoints here. First of all, 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;let me say that I don't think that TimeShip is doing this. That said, the 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;notion of "one way is as good as another" is quite contemptable to me. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;There is, and should be, a certain level of integrity which should be 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;maintained when dealing with the issue of cryonics. While it is true that 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;making it a "religious temple" would popularize the field as well as bring 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;in more money, it would sacrifice far more in the capital of integrity and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;morality than it would gain in monetary returns. In any business dealing I 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;have had so far I have found it immensely important to maintain a level of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;integrity and credibility. In my current venture, that remains true. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Though I cannot truly emphasize in words how deeply the concept of "selling 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;out for the sake of progress" bothers me (and this isn't a condemnation of 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;anyone, but a notion I have observed countless times in the past and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;present), suffice it to say that I would rather see all cryonics 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;organizations go belly-up (and the same is true of any technology) than see 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;them compromise their integrity and credibility for the sake of gaining new 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;members or even furthering the science itself. The idea is to market 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;cryonics effectively *without* trying to make it something it isn't. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;What it is is a possible alternative to death; one which presents a chance 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;for extended life that is by no means certain. The only faith involved is 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the faith (or rather, hope) that technology will advance to such a point as 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;to molecularly reconstruct damaged neural (and in some cases, visceral) 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;matter. To put it across as anything else would be deceitful, and though 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;"morality" is a subjective concept, it would generally be immoral as well. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;If we can't present something for what it is, then why should we pretend it 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;is something it isn't? 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Umm, because you're try to get a bunch of superstitious primates to buy into an idea, an idea that might save our lives. And yes, the end does justify the means.</DIV>
