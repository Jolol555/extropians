<p>Yes. A statement expressible within a formal axiomatic system is 
<br>
independent of the system if neither the statement  nor its negation 
<br>
can be proven within the system.
<br>
<p>But a new tendency in (the philosophy of) mathematics, called
<br>
&quot;experimental mathematics&quot;, is emerged. There is, also, the 
<br>
&quot;Journal of Experimental Mathematics&quot;. 
<br>
<p>See also J. Horgan, &quot;The Death of Proof&quot;, Scientific American, 
<br>
269 (1993), p. 74-82, and D. Zeilberger, &quot;Theorems for a Price: 
<br>
Tomorrow's Semi-Rigorous Mathematical Culture&quot;, Not. Amer. 
<br>
Math. Soc., 40 (1993), p. 978-981.
<br>
<p>There are, also, many mathematical propositions for which only 
<br>
computer proofs are available, in example the proof of four-colour 
<br>
problem (1976).
<br>
<p>And, of course calculations may yield considerably different
<br>
values, depending on machines and on softwares. Try, i.e.,
<br>
to iterate x[n+1] = 3,95 x[n] (1-x[n]).
<br>
<p>There are, also, very subtle situations. Goedel and Cohen
<br>
have shown that neither the CH (Continuum Hypothesis)
<br>
nor its negation can be proven within the ZF (Zermelo &amp;
<br>
Fraenkel) set theory plus the AC (Axiom of Choice). 
<br>
Now let f(n) be defined on the set of natural numbers and
<br>
&nbsp;f(n)  = 1 [if the CH is true]
<br>
&nbsp;f(n) =  0 [if the CH is false] 
<br>
Now f(n) is computable because there is the double algorithm above,
<br>
but the trouble is that we can not know which is the correct one, 
<br>
that is to say which of the two algorithms actually is the one
<br>
that computes f(n). Just because the CH is *independent* of
<br>
the standard framework for mathematics (the ZF plus the AC).
<br>
