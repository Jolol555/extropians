<p>A couple of problems here.  Lee was not talking about coercing these
<br>
created beings.  He was simply saying that their creator should not be
<br>
coerced to run them at a speed that was not practical to the creator's
<br>
purposes and needs.  Non-coercion should be both ways.  If these beings
<br>
are running on my hardware do you believe I am responsible for giving
<br>
them such resources for all eternity (and most likely growing resources)
<br>
by the fact of having created them?  If so, am I being coerced?  Or is
<br>
this similar to the duties of parents for offspring and so on?  Perhaps
<br>
our local SI (the one already present that keeps a low profile) is
<br>
goading us along to the point where we can provide our own resources and
<br>
thus give Ver a break. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The act of creation gives no moral right whatsoever to command or coerce.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is simply a historical fact about the causal origins of a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent entity.  Creators are not entirely powerless; they have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control over *what* is created; but once created, the creation is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizen, and independent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is the morality of it, those are the rights, in tomorrow's world as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this one; all that remains is the task of making it real.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Obviously that is not the full extent of it.
