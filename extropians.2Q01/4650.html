</em><br>
<p>Being relatively new to, but heavily involved in the cryonics community, I 
<br>
have noticed this tendency as well, though am not sure I understand the 
<br>
origin of the reasons behind the widespread vehemence.  It may be as simple 
<br>
as a case of differences in perspectives e.g.: X feels (or &quot;knows&quot;) that 
<br>
Y's methods will not work correctly.  Behind the basic concept of 
<br>
cryopreservation (or suspension, if you prefer), there is a vast body of 
<br>
science that is fundamentally unprovable at this point in time.  However, 
<br>
some contend that despite a certain procedure's lack of provable 
<br>
effectiveness, it works better than another procedure.  Essentially, there 
<br>
is a lot more than just faith in future technologies to rescue frozen 
<br>
corpses --there is a very high level of scientific discretion which is 
<br>
practiced by some, and apparently not by others.  Since there is no way to 
<br>
effectively &quot;prove&quot; that one is right or wrong, mud-slinging occurs over 
<br>
the various theories and practices.
<br>
<p>Of course, in my mind the mud-slinging is very unproductive and 
<br>
impractical.  I believe that the various organizations should essentially 
<br>
leave each other to practice in what way they feel is necessary to preserve 
<br>
the lives of its members and patients.  Since there is no way to prove that 
<br>
any one given method will work better than another, it is up to each 
<br>
individual cryopreservation company to maintain the procedural integrity 
<br>
that they feel is necessary to provide the best possible care.
<br>
<p>I personally believe that the companies which have the most logical proofs 
<br>
of the science of cryonics will be the ones who will do the best 
<br>
job.  Again, the difficulty is that those proofs are mostly speculative and 
<br>
ultimately subjective to each organization.  Mud-slinging doesn't help this 
<br>
though, and for the field of cryonics to have any public credibility at 
<br>
all, the slinging will need to stop.
<br>
<p>I plan on fleshing out some of the ideas stated above for publication in 
<br>
the near future.
