<p>Just so we don't go beating up &quot;too much&quot; on people who are misinformed,
<br>
please know that I've sent him a note on where he goes wrong and who he
<br>
should read to better inform himself.  He responded with a quite polite
<br>
&quot;guilty as charged&quot;.
<br>
<p>For those of you who are interested there is a piece called &quot;When Scientists
<br>
Overextend Themselves&quot; here:

<p>It isn't clear whether you disagree with his claims regarding the &quot;causes&quot;
<br>
(which are what is wrong) or his arguments that machines and humans will merge.
<br>
<p>I'd say on the last point he has a lot of company.  One of the things we need
<br>
to figure out how to manage successfully is how to allow those who want to merge
<br>
to do so while respecting the rights of those who choose not to follow this path.
<br>
<p>For those of you who are unaware, the answers to the question of &quot;why do
<br>
organisms age?&quot; are &quot;the declining force of natural selection&quot; and
<br>
&quot;antagonistic plieotropy&quot;.  They probably carry different weights in
<br>
different species.  These were proposed by Williams and Hamilton back
<br>
in the '50's and '60's but still aren't widely known.  You can find the
<br>
references for the books &amp; papers under: <a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/Authors/Aging/">http://www.aeiveos.com/Authors/Aging/</a>
