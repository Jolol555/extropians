<em>&gt;Power Lines May Raise Cancer Risk, Study Shows
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By Patricia Reaney
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Power lines can cause a small increase in the risk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;childhood leukaemia, a new report is expected to show on Tuesday.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The review of recently published studies into the health effects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;electromagnetic fields (EMF) emitted from power lines will conclude that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the increase in risk is very small, but it could prompt calls for a change
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in regulations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;``There is evidence, albeit not statistically that clear, of a slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elevated risk of childhood leukaemia in association with very high mains
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power fields at levels that are not usual in Britain,'' Professor Colin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Blakemore, of Oxford University, told journalists before publication of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the report on Tuesday.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Blakemore is a member of a committee headed by Professor Sir Richard Doll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that examined the results of research commissioned by the National
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Radiological Protection Board (NRPB).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The committee's report is expected to conclude that the risk is real but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;low and to call for more research into the danger and the mechanism that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could cause it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Doll is the scientist who first established the link between smoking and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cancer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The new report is the latest in a series of studies into EMFs. Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concluded they posed no increased danger to human health while others
</em><br>
<em>&gt;raised concern about a risk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;EMFs are generated by the electricity running through power lines from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;giant cables to small lines feeding household power outlets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The UK Childhood Cancer Study that was published in The Lancet medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;journal in 1999 found that radiation from power lines did not increase the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;risk of leukaemia. A separate study in New Zealand had similar findings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But research from the University of Bristol in southwest England found
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that people living and working near high voltage electricity cables were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more exposed than others to cancer-causing pollutants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The new report is expected to show that for children exposed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;highest levels of EMFs, the risk of contracting leukaemia could be less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than one in 10,000 cases per year, compared with the usual risk of one in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;20,000 cases per year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Blakemore said the risk was so low that it was unlikely to pose any real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;danger to British children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said she could not comment on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the report before its publication on Tuesday. ``Until they (the results)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are officially published we won't be able to respond to it,'' she said.

<em>&gt;For years I've denounced superstitious idiots for their belief that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;living near major power lines must be getting injured by the `radiation'. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was chagrined last night to learn on the news that a new British medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;report headed by a notable scientist finds that the incidence of childhood
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leukemia *does* rise in the vicinity of those lines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So far I haven't found this reported on line in the NYT or the Age, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gist seemed to be that this rise is marginal. It's hypothesized to be due
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to microscopic pollutants being ionized by high density fields on the lines
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and thereby rendered more carcinogenic (or maybe more `sticky'). That is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the fields themselves do not directly exert a mysterious malign influence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which is doubtless what most opponents suppose. Moreover, since this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;new-found effect is so marginal, it's rather hard to see how opponents
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could have known previously that it existed; that is, they presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reached the correct conclusion on the basis of an unsupported superstition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then again, is that fair? Arguably, their underlying skeptical suspicion is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we're unlikely to make major de nova interventions into the biosphere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without having *some* hitherto-unknown impacts (which of course could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beneficial as well as deleterious, but it's easier to smash a delicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thing than to improve it).
