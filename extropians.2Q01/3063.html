<em>&gt;What is the trend in the US military that is the very most unique
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the modern day? It isn't mechanization of war, which has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seen in nearly every age. The thing that most clearly identifies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the modern U.S. military, I propose, is the intolerance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;casualties, even one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What ended the U.S. involvement in Somalia? The TV image
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a single dead U.S. soldier being dragged thru the streets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As soon as that was shown on the evening news, the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;turned against the action. I see in this the key to ending all war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I predict that as soon as practical, all our weapons and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surveillance systems will be drones with their controllers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;warm and safe at home. spike
</em><br>
<p>I'd agree, up to a point;  For some of the peoples of this world, images of 
<br>
their menfolk being dragged through the streets can have just the opposite 
<br>
effect.  It can be the path to martyrdom and Jihad.
<br>
<p>Looking at it another way, when they've finished showing the U.S. soldier 
<br>
being dragged through the streets, and the public calls for withdrawal, and 
<br>
all the cameras are packed up and gone home, who will videotape the 
<br>
suffering they leave behind?
<br>
<p>I'm with you on your prediction of &quot;war at a distance&quot;.  &quot;On Killing&quot;, a 
<br>
book I believe I've mentioned on this list before, shows quite clearly the 
<br>
side-effects when human troopers are in close proximity combat situations.
<br>
<p><p>James...
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
