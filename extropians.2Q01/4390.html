It's been known for some time that onset of symptoms could take up to 
<br>
30 years. Cryo--interesting question, as well as effect of life 
<br>
extension on probablity of coming down with this thing.. Stopped 
<br>
eating red meat years ago because of this nasty--but then, a 
<br>
restaurant will likely fry my eggs in the same spot they made a 
<br>
hamburger. Still, have to be reducing the odds.
<br>
<p>Anyone doubting eventual appearance of vCJD in US should read this:

<br>
<p>Compared with Europe, US is completely reckless, thanks to money 
<br>
flowing to the power of the beef/poultry industry, and thence to the 
<br>
regulators. Best-case scenario: Appearance in Europe was freak 
<br>
occurrence (perhaps related to genetics of Cow Zero) and will not 
<br>
repeat here in spite of seemingly identical conditions; no prions 
<br>
will be imported into the US foodchain (unless a tourist falls into a 
<br>
balogna mixer).
<br>
<p>Cross your fingers and hope to live.

&gt; A frightening article from <a href="http://www.newscientist.com">http://www.newscientist.com</a>...
&gt; Here is an excerpt:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;.......
&gt; Gene data reveals that further waves of human deaths due to mad cow disease 
&gt; are likely
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Further waves of deaths from the human form of mad cow disease look 
&gt; increasingly inevitable, following new genetic studies in mice.
&gt; 
&gt; These show that mice can vary enormously in the time they take to develop an 
&gt; equivalent disease, depending on the combination of genes they have 
&gt; inherited.
&gt; 
&gt; The studies undermine hopes that the 100 or so victims to date of variant 
&gt; Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (vCJD) only succumbed to the disease because of 
&gt; freak variations in one key gene.
&gt; 
&gt; The new work suggests the time it takes to develop the disease might depend 
&gt; on a combination of several genes, not just one. This means that far greater 
&gt; numbers of us could be &quot;incubating&quot; the disease, but have yet to show 
&gt; symptoms.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;It's not a question of whether you get the disease, but when,&quot; says John 
&gt; Collinge, the neurogeneticist at University College London who led the 
&gt; research. He adds that, if we are fortunate, the incubation times may be 
&gt; longer than natural lifespans for many people.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;We would predict that some humans would have very long incubation periods 
&gt; and others would have short ones depending on the cocktail of gene variants 
&gt; they've got,&quot; he says.
&gt; .......&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; So, does anyone know if the prion disease will continue to ravage the brain 
&gt; even when submerged in LN2 (or at the proposed, somewhat warmer storage 
&gt; conditions)?
