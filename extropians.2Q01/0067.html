The references from Damien show that NASA has already built a maglev track
<br>
for testing. NASA is contemplating using a maglev track to accelerate
<br>
rockets to around 600 mph (966 kph) before takeoff to produce big savings in
<br>
fuel (and therefore weight) at a cost of around $75 for electricity per
<br>
launch.
<br>
<p>But Sandia's Z machine seems to be a quite different animal. They are
<br>
talking about accelerating safely to 13 km/sec = 46,800 kph!  (With the
<br>
ability to do more if the projectile stands up to it).
<br>
<p>Quote: &quot;The propulsion technique works by applying the Z machine's 20
<br>
million amps to produce an evolving magnetic field that expands in
<br>
approximately 200 nanoseconds to reach several million atmospheres pressure.
<br>
The relatively gentle acceleration produced by the field is similar to that
<br>
which might be experienced in a smoothly rising high-speed elevator, rather
<br>
than from the shock imparted by a firearm. Accelerated to 13 km/sec, the
<br>
plates are neither distorted, melted, nor vaporized, as they would be if
<br>
shot from a gun&quot;.
<br>
<p>So combine the two systems and we have a rocket which can be flung up into
<br>
orbit and still have fuel for docking.  The small technical problem is
<br>
probably in building a Z machine that can work with anything bigger than a
<br>
dime sized pellet. Maybe some hybrid device to vastly improve the mag-lev
<br>
track acceleration?

<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
<br>
$14.5 billion budget for 2002 represents a small increase for NASA but a
<br>
giant leap in funding for its program to develop new ways to launch things
<br>
into space.
<br>
President Bush's plan, delivered to Congress on Wednesday, would give the
<br>
U.S. space agency just a 2 percent rise in overall funding compared to 2001,
<br>
but its Space Launch Initiative would get a 64 percent increase.
<br>
<p><p>We can wish, can't we?
