<em>&gt; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were the dinosaurs millions of years ago, the simulation has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; since the start of time, and it's better known as reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We're not in a simulation. I know...  how boring.

<em>&gt; Notice, however, the last sentence in The Economist article:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Let us hope it does not develop any personality disorders.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think considering itself to be in a simulation might qualify as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personality disorder?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand, becuse I haven't read that article to which you refer.
<br>
Basically, if people see movies about it or have already considered it, then
<br>
actually thinking that the world is a simulation and not reality is probably a
<br>
delusion.  Yet, moreso what it is is a search for explanations, where the
<br>
explanations of the metaphysics behind reality have largely in history been a
<br>
discussion of religion.
<br>
<p>I think that there's some higher power, but it might not be directed.  What
<br>
this implies is that everyone and everything, including the dinosaur fossils
<br>
and all our memories, could have been created about two seconds ago.  Yet, it
<br>
is likely that this is not the case, for we have all of those things, and the
<br>
physical laws of the universe as we know it would not allow it.
<br>
<p>Thus, it would be magic.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The convergence of info-technology, bio-technology, and nano-technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (referenced in the article pointed to in Max's recent post), promises to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make friendly robots a reality before SI, by all reasonable guesses. Ergo,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary phase transition will make Darwin more comfortable among the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines than among the humans.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily.  The humans can wear exosuits, get implants, or drive tanks
<br>
to negate any robot advantage.  Also, we made the robots, and humans are very
<br>
good at breaking things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By that I mean machines will evolve more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly than humans.
</em><br>
<p>The art and science of machining has certainly gained great ground in the last
<br>
hundreds of years.
<br>
<p>Basically, as long as no robots bent on humanity's destruction get made or are
<br>
made, and as long as no evil robots get missile command, then we have nothing
<br>
to fear.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So, expecting to take part in the phase transition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may constitute a personality disorder as far as autonomous robots are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned. I'm not trying to be negative here, just pointing out this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinct possibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stay hungry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --J. R.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Useless hypotheses: consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free will
</em><br>
<p>Basically, we can't outcompute a computer, yet, that's all it is, computation,
<br>
based upon rules either directly or indirectly written by people.  Any
<br>
consciousness that it could have would be human.
<br>
<p>So, I think Luddites are like &quot;Chicken Little&quot;, the barnyard chicken that
<br>
proclaimed the fall of the sky, it never happened.
<br>
<p>Also, actual investment in research and development is the only way for
<br>
humanity to escape Malthusian pressures, as well as to increase economic
<br>
productivity of fixed capital.  In terms of Darwin, we're all competing, with
<br>
each other and against the insects, except to the extent where it is rational
<br>
to cooperate.  Thus, a thousand years has brought us from feudalism to the
<br>
global village.
