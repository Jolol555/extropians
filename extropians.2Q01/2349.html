<p>Yes, I should think so, if you're thinking of vertebrates like us.
<br>
This is what I said a year ago
<br>
( <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/5580.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/5580.html</a> )
<br>
about Edelman's opinion of the matter:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Edelman believes that, in the biological realm, this capability is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite old: &quot;Which animals have consciousness?  ...  Going backward from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human referent, we may be reasonably sure...  that chimpanzees have it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In all likelihood, most mammals and some birds may have it...  If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain systems required by the present model represent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; **only** evolutionary path to primary consciousness, we can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly sure that animals without a cortex or its equivalent lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  An amusing speculation is that cold-blooded animals with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primitive cortices would face severe restrictions on primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness because their value systems and value-category
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory lack a stable enough biochemical milieu in which to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate linkages to a system that could sustain such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness.  So snakes are in (dubiously, depending on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temperature), but lobsters are out.  If further study bears out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this surmise, consciousness is about 300 million years old&quot; (BABF
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pp. 122-123).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; ...some animal babies are able to function very well immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after birth.  Horse colts run with the herd within hours.  Evidently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are able to function very well with virtually no experience.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm no more an ethologist than I am a neuroscientist or
<br>
a philosopher.  But I'd say that horses are an ill-chosen example
<br>
of the point you're trying to make.  Pick an invertebrate instead.
<br>
Of course, nearly **any** animal, vertebrate or not, comes into
<br>
the world as a ready-to-go, turnkey system compared to a human
<br>
being.
<br>
<p>I can give you some quotes apropos your observation from a post I made
<br>
late last year about the book _Darwin Machines and the Nature of
<br>
Knowledge_ by Henry C. Plotkin (the post is in the archive's
<br>
blind spot at the moment; it'll be back on the shelf
<br>
when it comes back from the binder's ;-&gt; ).  [It's getting so I
<br>
have so much relevant material on this subject in my e-mail archive,
<br>
I can just cut and paste!]  I quoted:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; p. 137
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         [The] period of time between receiving a set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         genetic instructions and their implementation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         through development to the point where those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         selfsame instructions might be returned, via
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         reproduction, to the gene pool, has been given a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         variety of names...  Konrad Lorenz... called it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         generational deadtime.  It is a lag-time that is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         invariant feature of any system whose construction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         takes time and which is based on a set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         instructions that cannot be continually updated.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         the case of sexually reproducing organisms, each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         organism is cast off and cut off from the gene pool
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         with a fixed set of instructions that cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         altered.  It cannot &quot;dip&quot; back into the gene pool to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         augment these instructions if it finds they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         good enough.  In this sense, genetically, it is on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         its own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p. 145
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         [One way] for an organism to reduce the amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         significant change it has to deal with... is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         reduce the period of time between conception and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         reproductive competence...  This means that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         ratio of life-span length to numbers of offspring is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         low...  This is a characteristic 'life-style' of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         animals known to ecologists as r-strategists...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         These r-strategists usually live less than one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         year...; they develop rapidly; they are usually of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         small body size; and they normally reproduce over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         just a single period.  This is the life-history
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         strategy common to most invertebrate animals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         clearly one that is... relatively successful...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p. 146
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         [A] second very general way of dealing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         change... [is to] change the phenotypes so they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         change with and match the changing features of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         world.  This, in turn, comprises two general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         strategies.  The one results in changes between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         phenotypes, and relies on the chance or radical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         component of the primary heuristic [the mechanism of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         classical Darwinian evolution, involving genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         variation and selection among competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         phenotypes]...  [Large] numbers of offspring are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         produced,... each...  different from the others...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         r-strategists... often do combine a short life-span
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         with a quite prominent radical component of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         primary heuristic...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p. 147
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Another... strategy is to match change with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         change... by giving rise to change **within**
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         phenotypes...  I will call this the tracking option.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p. 149
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         How can such changes be tracked?  The only way to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         it is to evolve tracking devices whose own states
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         can be altered and held in that altered condition
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         for the same period of time as the features of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         world which they are tracking...  Such tracking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         devices would be set in place by the usual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         evolutionary processes of the primary heuristic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         hence would operate within certain limits...  These
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         additional knowledge-gaining devices comprise a...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         secondary... heuristic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         ...[T]here are two such classes of semi-autonomous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         knowledge-gaining devices or secondary heuristics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         that can track change in this way.  The immune
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         system is one; the intelligence mechanisms of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         brain are the other.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; To me this suggests a greater role for genetically determined structures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versus experiential ones.  We aren't really bringing our whole weight of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience to bear on every moment, or rather, that is only the smallest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of what we are bringing.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly not &quot;versus&quot;!  We're bringing to bear the experience within a
<br>
single lifetime, **plus** the experience accumulated across eons of
<br>
evolutionary history, encoded in the genome.  See Plotkin, above.
<br>
I don't know what metric you'd use to try to decide whether the primary
<br>
or secondary heuristic is more &quot;important&quot;; the latter certainly
<br>
couldn't have come into existence without the former.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Messages, verbal communications, succeed not so much because we share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough experiences with others that we can reconstruct their minds;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather, they succeed because our brains are structured so as to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to elicit meaning from these communications.
</em><br>
<p>Since our brains' physical structure is determined by **both** genetics
<br>
and experience, &quot;meaning&quot; must depend on both.  Oh, and throw in the
<br>
body and the whole social and physical milieu, too.  Undoubtedly, there's
<br>
been some genetic &quot;streamlining&quot; that ensures that all normal human beings
<br>
learn to speak.  That genetic predisposition certainly doesn't mean that
<br>
anybody is born knowing English, or French, or Chinese (though it probably
<br>
constrains **all** human languages in ways only dimly understood).  Contrast
<br>
this to reading and writing, which before the advent of mass education in
<br>
industrialized countries, were considered as miraculous an accomplishment
<br>
as learning to play the piano is today, and are still hard enough to teach
<br>
that not everyone is guaranteed to achieve literacy (dyslexia seems to get
<br>
written about in _Time_ magazine every few months; Tom Cruise is supposed
<br>
to be dyslexic, etc.; being born aphasic is rare enough that I can't recall
<br>
ever having seen a magazine or newspaper article about it).
<br>
<p>So again, think of &quot;experience&quot; in a broader sense, as also annexing
<br>
the evolutionary history of the human race.
<br>
<p>However, to examine the effect of experience in the ordinary sense
<br>
on language acquisition, have a look at the sad story of &quot;Genie&quot;.
<br>
See, for example <a href="http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/hsbioethics/unit3_4.htm">http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/hsbioethics/unit3_4.htm</a>
<br>
(there are references at the end), or Google search the keywords
<br>
Rymer and Genie.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, what does this say about AI?  Not that AIs must be structured &quot;just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like us&quot; in order to be able to communicate with us.  It is plausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that convergent evolution would produce brains by independent mechanisms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which can communicate.  And since we are designing AIs which can function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in human society, I don't think there is much danger that they will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unable to communicate with us.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;communication&quot;.  If that takes place
<br>
through complexity matching as described by Edelman and Tononi,
<br>
then similarity of physical structure, life history, and
<br>
phylogenetic history provides much reassurance that communication
<br>
is &quot;really&quot; taking place (we don't have AIs or extraterrestrials yet,
<br>
so this question only comes up in practice with non-human terrestrial
<br>
animals at the moment).
<br>
<p>However, in _Word &amp; Object_ by W. V. O. Quine (1960), the author develops
<br>
a theory of the &quot;radical indeterminacy of translation&quot; even among human
<br>
languages.  Quine imagines a linguist visiting a heretofore undiscovered
<br>
tribe, and attempting to compile a lexicography of the unknown jungle
<br>
language.  Such a translation comprises a consistent system of analytical
<br>
hypotheses, but not necessarily a unique one.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In Chapter II, &quot;Translation and Meaning&quot;, Section 15
<br>
&quot;Analytical Hypotheses&quot; (pp. 71-72), Quine writes:
<br>
<p>&quot;Whatever the details of its expository devices of word translation
<br>
and syntactical paradigm, the linguist's finished jungle-to-English
<br>
manual has as its net yield an infinite **semantic correlation** of
<br>
sentences: the implicit specification of an English sentence, or
<br>
various roughly interchangeable English sentences, for every one of
<br>
the infinitely many possible jungle sentences.  Most of the semantic
<br>
correlation is supported only by analytical hypotheses, in their
<br>
extension beyond the zone where independent evidence for translation
<br>
is possible.  That those unverifiable translations proceed without
<br>
mishap must not be taken as pragmatic evidence of good lexicography,
<br>
for mishap is impossible...
<br>
<p>[C]ountless native sentences admitting no independent check...
<br>
may be expected to receive radically unlike and incompatible
<br>
English rendering under ... two [different] systems [of
<br>
translational hypotheses].
<br>
<p>There is an obstacle to offering an actual example of two such
<br>
rival systems of analytical hypotheses.  Known languages are
<br>
known through unique systems of analytical hypotheses established
<br>
in tradition or painfully arrived at by unique skilled linguists.
<br>
To devise a contrasting system would require an entire duplicate
<br>
enterprise of translation, unaided even by the usual hints
<br>
from interpreters.  Yet one has only to reflect on the nature
<br>
of possible data and methods to appreciate the indeterminacy...
<br>
There can be no doubt that rival systems of analytical
<br>
hypotheses can fit the totality of speech behavior to perfection,
<br>
and can fit the totality of dispositions to speech behavior as
<br>
well, and still specify mutually incompatible translations of
<br>
countless sentences insusceptible of independent control.
<br>
<p>Section 16 &quot;On Failure to Perceive the Indeterminacy&quot; (pp. 73-77):
<br>
<p>&quot;A ... cause of the failure to appreciate the point is confusion
<br>
of it with the platitude that uniqueness of translation is absurd.
<br>
The indeterminacy that I mean is more radical.  It is that rival
<br>
systems of analytical hypotheses can conform to all speech dispositions
<br>
with each of the languages concerned and yet dictate, in countless
<br>
cases, utterly disparate translations; not mere mutual paraphrases,
<br>
but translations each of which would be excluded by the other
<br>
system of translation.  Two such translations might even be patently
<br>
contrary in truth value, provided there is no stimulation that would
<br>
encourage assent to either.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Something of the true situation verges on visibility when the
<br>
sentences concerned are extremely theoretical.  Thus who would
<br>
undertake to translate 'Neutrinos lack mass' into the jungle
<br>
language?  If anyone does, we may expect him to coin words or
<br>
distort the usage of old ones.  We may expect him to plead in
<br>
extenuation that the natives lack the requisite concepts; also
<br>
that they know too little physics.  And he is right, except
<br>
for the hint of there being some free-floating, linguistically
<br>
neutral meaning which we capture, in 'Neutrinos lack mass',
<br>
and the native cannot.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Observation sentences peel nicely; their meanings, stimulus
<br>
meanings, emerge absolute and free of residual verbal taint...
<br>
Theoretical sentences such as 'Neutrinos lack mass,' or the
<br>
law of entropy, or the constancy of the speed of light, are
<br>
at the other extreme.  It is of such sentences above all that
<br>
Wittgenstein's dictum holds true:  'Understanding a sentence
<br>
means understanding a language.'  Such sentences, and countless
<br>
ones that lie intermediate between the two extremes, lack
<br>
linguistically neutral meaning.
<br>
<p>There is no telling how much of one's success with analytical
<br>
hypotheses is due to real kinship of outlook on the part of the
<br>
natives and ourselves, and how much of it is due to linguistic
<br>
ingenuity or lucky coincidence.  I am not sure that it even
<br>
makes sense to ask.  We may alternately wonder at the
<br>
inscrutability of the native mind and wonder at how very
<br>
much like us the native is, where in the one case we have
<br>
merely muffed the best translation and in the other case we
<br>
have done a more thorough job of reading our own provincial
<br>
modes into the native's speech.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>One frequently hears it urged that deep differences of language
<br>
carry with them ultimate differences in the way one thinks,
<br>
or looks upon the world.  I would urge that what is most
<br>
generally involved is indeterminacy of correlation.  There is
<br>
less basis of comparison -- less sense in saying what is good
<br>
translation and what is bad -- the farther we get away from
<br>
sentences with visibly direct conditioning to non-verbal
<br>
stimuli and the farther we get off home ground.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ultimately what is necessary for communication is a common language,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and common understanding about the world.  There is nothing surprising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about this; it is completely obvious.  We will never communicate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIs who don't understand the meaning of the words we use.  And to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this understanding is to understand the world and the language.
</em><br>
<p>There's another one of those slippery concepts -- &quot;understanding&quot;.
<br>
And what will it take for those AI's to understand the meaning of
<br>
the words we use?  That's the big question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This was the insight which led to Lenat's CYC project.  It is an attempt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to teach a computer how the world works, in the hopes that this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow us to communicate with it.  So far, CYC appears to be a failure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from what I have read.  This does not necessarily mean that the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is fundamentally wrong; rather, perhaps the mechanism being used is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate for representing the world.
</em><br>
<p>That was the main point of my post, the dubiousness (in the opinion of
<br>
Edelman and other neuroscientists of the past decade or so) of the old
<br>
cognitivist notion that statements in formal logic and an inference
<br>
engine linking them together can possibly be the internal **basis** for
<br>
conscious interaction with the world by an autonomous intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ultimately, however we achieve AI, the machine will have to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to learn about the world.  This doesn't mean it must smell and taste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and dance; humans unfortunate enough to have been trapped in paralyzed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies have still developed full language skills.  This proves that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is possible to learn enough about the world by being told, to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it and speak about it.
</em><br>
<p>By being told?  No.  That's another piece of this whole subtle question.
<br>
Being **embodied** is probably necessary for intelligence.
<br>
<p>Good night!
