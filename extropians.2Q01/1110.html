Here's an article about cloning:
<br>
&quot;<a href="http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/079/nation/Israeli_doctor_battles_rabbis_politicians_in_bid_to_clone+.shtml">http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/079/nation/Israeli_doctor_battles_rabbis_politicians_in_bid_to_clone+.shtml</a>&quot;
<br>
It's mostly pretty standard. It has to do with an Israeli scientist, Avi 
<br>
Ben-Abraham, on the multi-national team of scientists trying to clone a 
<br>
human, and how he thinks it should be done in Israel. But this sentence 
<br>
stood out:
<br>
<p>&quot;The 43-year-old doctor, whose career includes a stint as head of a US 
<br>
&lt;b&gt;project to freeze dead people&lt;/b&gt; and a failed bid for Israeli office, 
<br>
has also been treated with skepticism by the press.&quot;
<br>
<p>What is this &quot;project to freeze dead people&quot;? Is this a reference to 
<br>
cryonics? Does anyone know anything about Avi Ben-Abraham?

&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Gates is supposed to walk through the airport with an armful of pies
