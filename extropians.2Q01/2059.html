<em>&gt;From: &quot;Mark Plus&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:markplus@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20MED:%20&quot;Frankenstein%20fears%20after%20head%20transplant&quot;&In-Reply-To=&lt;F950sca0ZkfzDskqC5E00001e26@hotmail.com&gt;">markplus@hotmail.com</a>&gt;

<p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;'Scientifically misleading'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The arguments against head and brain transplants were outlined by Dr 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Stephen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rose, director of brain and behavioural research at the Open University.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He said: &quot;This is medical technology run completely mad and out of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proportion to what's needed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;It's entirely misleading to suggest that a head transplant or a brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transplant is actually really still connected in anything except in terms 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blood stream to the body to which it has been transplanted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No shit. For a paralyzed person, it's the blood supply which is important. 
<br>
He's getting from the new body exactly the functionality he had from the old 
<br>
body, without the multiple organ failure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;It's not controlling or relating to that body in any other sort of way.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>At least in what was quoted, I didn't see anything suggesting that this was 
<br>
implied.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;He added: &quot;It's scientifically misleading, technically irrelevant and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientifically irrelevant, and apart from anything else a grotesque breach
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of any ethical consideration.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;ethical consideration&quot; has come to mean reasoning from an ivorty tower 
<br>
about abstract non-issues while people die.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;It's a mystification to call it either a head transplant or a brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transplant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;All you're doing is keeping a severed head alive in terms of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circulation from another animal. It's not connected in any nervous sense.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The issue of who someone who had received a head transplant would &quot;be&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extremely complicated, said Professor Rose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>He's wrong. It's pretty clear that it's a body transplant. Although, if you 
<br>
ask around, you'll be surprised about how many people would disagree. Ask 
<br>
&quot;If someone put a new brain into your head, would you be getting a new 
<br>
brain, or would that brain be getting a new body?&quot;, a lot of people will 
<br>
think it's the first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Your person is largely embodied but not entirely in your brain&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He added: &quot;I cannot see any medical grounds for doing this. I cannot see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that scientifically you would actually be able to regenerate the nerves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which could produce that sort of control.
</em><br>
<p>I forget the exact quote but someone asked Maxwell of what use his 
<br>
experiments on electromagnetism was, and he said something like &quot;Of what use 
<br>
is a newborn baby?&quot;.
<br>
<p>I wonder - did the reported who approached Dr. Stephen Rose lie to him about 
<br>
what the experiment was about?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;And I think that the experiments are the sort that are wholly unethical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inappropriate for any possible reason.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We live in a world of stupid pigfuckers and I'm reminded of it more and more 
<br>
every day...
