<p>What I said was that a superintelligence could figure out a way of getting 
<br>
rid of the boredom emotion if it chose to do so. It *might* have reasons to 
<br>
keep some kind of susceptibility to boredom. However, at the times when it 
<br>
is just wanting to be entertained it would be possible to tune down the 
<br>
boredom.
