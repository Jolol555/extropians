Robert writes, regarding simulatd people:
<br>
<em>&gt; Ok, but they are not &quot;real&quot; in the sense that their existence is purposeless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our universe, if it is the &quot;real&quot; universe, does not exist for any reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It simply &quot;is&quot; (as far as I can tell).  Sim-ed universes exist for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason be it scientific exploration, a need for entertainment, or a desire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for company, etc.  If the creator of those universes exhausts their usefullness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe they have every right to fold them up and reallocate the resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to something else.
</em><br>
<p>How would you characterize the individuals in The Matrix who were trapped
<br>
in the simulation?  Are they real people or not?  We know they have
<br>
physical bodies which lie in gel-filled pods, while their consciousness
<br>
interacts in virtual reality.  They are unaware of their true nature and
<br>
their existence is essentially purposeless.  It seems like this would
<br>
satisfy your definition of saying that these people are not &quot;real&quot;.
<br>
<p>Yet we can stand there and look at them in their pods.  Does it make
<br>
sense to say that these physical people, lying there and thinking in
<br>
front of us, are not real?
<br>
