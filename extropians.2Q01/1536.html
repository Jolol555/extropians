<p>I don't see right wing libertarians being against new technology
<br>
whatsoever. Luddism reflects a fundamentalist worldview at its core, no
<br>
matter how it is manifested and spliced into one's other dogma. Marxists
<br>
can be as fundamentalist as Shiites, Baptists, Feminists, etc. in
<br>
demanding a respect for a pure representation of some past dogma. Harvey
<br>
and Neal are right to say that the left is not alone in its Luddism,
<br>
however to date they have been better organized, funded, and extremist
<br>
in taking action for their cause, much along the lines of the
<br>
anti-abortion radical christians of the early 90's. While radical
<br>
christians have been generally discredited in claiming to be christians
<br>
and terrorists simultaneously, thus limiting their support, radical
<br>
leftists have no such dogmatic qualms against taking extreme action, and
<br>
thus the work of Ted Kazinski has continued to inspire and excite those
<br>
on the left interested in bringing down capitalism and industrial
<br>
technology to establish a primitivist state.
