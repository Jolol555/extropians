<p>I believe that both you and Eugene Leitl are looking at this
<br>
in practical rather than in philosophic-theoretical terms.
<br>
I think that I'm agreeing with Eugene that it would require
<br>
a much more grandiose context to achieve this than is usually
<br>
present in most SF, or even in most thought-experiments.
<br>
<p>But as a question of pure theory, who knows what kinds of 
<br>
transfer rates could be achieved in computronium?  That is,
<br>
if c is still a limiting factor, it may be that far vaster
<br>
amounts of information might lie relatively close by than
<br>
we would think.  (But I don't know if this would qualify as
<br>
magic physics so far as you are concerned.)
<br>
<p>Eugene Leitl also added,
<br>
<em>&gt; ...computations are computations. Regardless how they're

</em><br>
<p>Conway's Game of Life is a great example.  It turns out that you
<br>
can speed up the Generations a lot by lookup.  And it's also
<br>
known that gliders and spaceships in Life can be arranged to
<br>
do &quot;or&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, and &quot;and&quot; gates, and so forth, so that anything
<br>
a CPU or Turing Machine can do can also be emulated in Life.
<br>
Including sentience.
<br>
<p>Yet I still believe that if we slowly shifted away from looking
<br>
up relatively small areas on a Life Board, and had one of these
<br>
incredible 10^10^10^10 size lookup tables, so that an intelligent
<br>
creature's next response needn't be calculated but only looked
<br>
up, then the creature would not be conscious during subsequent
<br>
runs, (i.e., after the initial lookup table had been created).
<br>
<p>For a graphic example, suppose that our present Earth is only
<br>
one of 10^50 simulations that were being run to make an 
<br>
enormous Eugene Leitl lookup table.  When all the data from
<br>
all the 10^50 simulated Earth's were collated, every time
<br>
that you want to interact with Eugene in any way, even go
<br>
on a hike with him, all you need do at each millisecond
<br>
is lookup what he would do based upon (a) the present state
<br>
he's in and (b) the current input he's receiving from the
<br>
environment.
<br>
<p>Sure, you'd apparently get the right behavior as output.
<br>
But the real Eugene would no longer be with us.  Right now,
<br>
ask him a question, and the wheels really turn.  A great
<br>
deal of logic and calculation occurs, where, significantly
<br>
a lot of information flows from state to subsequent state.
<br>
But in this lookup table, there is no actual calculation.
<br>
At each point in time, you merely form the enormous 10^30
<br>
bit long address; say 10^10 bits for the input this milli-
<br>
second, and 10^20 bits for his current state, and voila!
<br>
You fetch from the computronium his next state.  But no
<br>
information flows. It's not a real calculation, I think.
