<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of all possible uses for my time; a pity, since there are so *many*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; obvious campaign ideas...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You mean &quot;Stop the bad SI from transcending and taking over the world&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Help the good SI transcend and take over the world&quot;, &quot;Be the SI and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take over the world&quot; and &quot;Fix the ridgeways clenchirions in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; armiphlange&quot;? :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any campaign that centers altered or improved cognition is a Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaign, not just campaigns where the main action takes place in the High
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transcend or SIAI's basement.  There's the entire realm of neurohacked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans to consider, for example.  And uploads.  And brain-computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfaces.  And infrahuman and human-equiv and only slightly transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIs. 
</em><br>
<p>In my current campaign, the player have one group of characters that are
<br>
the executive board of a major corporation. With the exception of some
<br>
slight genetic tweaking in one case, they are standard homo sapiens. But
<br>
they all use wearables running agent software giving them instant access
<br>
to their staff and vast computing resources. In a sense, they already
<br>
are SIs, it is just that their intelligence is the result of a huge
<br>
pyramid of consultants, clipping services, simulation and visualisation
<br>
software, information managers, search engines and contact networks
<br>
acting together rather than their own brains being extremely enhanced.
<br>
They probably have an effective intelligence far larger than the actual
<br>
transhumans in the setting, at least for now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And all the gruesome GMing possibilities that open up when, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter what the players do, you can pretend that the evil transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opponent thought of it three months in advance and had a horrible trap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ready; where losing a battle or being captured by the enemy or finding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; McGuffin can alter the character's mind and personality (and &quot;IQ&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attribute); where the players, even with their magic technology, can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outfight *or* outsmart the enemy and are forced to try and work within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever complex manipulative strategy the enemy is running them through;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where pieces of the character's thoughts and personality can wind up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embedded in random Internet sites, or the opponent; where the &quot;players&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only slowly learn that they are pawns in a still more complex game, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're never quite sure which of the real Players are the good guys, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'll *never* be able to extricate themselves...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When the enemy is a transhuman, you can do *anything* to the players.
</em><br>
<p>Which is of course why such games seldom work. Having an enemy that is
<br>
simply unbeatable doesn't work in the paradigm of &quot;heros vs. enemies&quot;
<br>
since the fight is so uneven that it doesn't even matter. It might work
<br>
better if the supremacy of the opponent is actually part of the setting
<br>
and the game deals with an entirely different issue; for example, in
<br>
Vampire: the Masquerade elder vampires can do practically everything you
<br>
describe, but the real game still works because characters struggle with
<br>
their own unlives and local politics rather than deal with the (in this
<br>
case very literally) posthuman antediluvians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Roleplaying a game where the players are also transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would obviously be a lot more difficult, but it could be done, perhaps by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowing the players to get away with far more devious and twisted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategies than would ever work in real life, or by modifying the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaign, invisibly and on the fly, so that whatever &quot;transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deductions&quot; the players come up with turn out to be the truth.
</em><br>
<p>In the above campaign, I of course give the players a lot of helpful
<br>
information as well as point out when an idea is subtly bad (you have
<br>
probably seen the advice for evil masterminds: &quot;always keep a five year
<br>
old girl at hand to explain your plan to. If she sees a flaw, don't
<br>
implement it&quot;; a software or employee version of this can be quite
<br>
useful and I simply assume the characters have one). It is very fun to
<br>
have players brainstorm, building plans on the fly and let autonomous
<br>
systems implement them. Now we need only to make software and
<br>
organisations that make this game *real*. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And then there's simply Ravna and Pham trying to outrun the Blight, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Roger and Deborah diverting the DoD's tanks while fighting it out with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mailman.
</em><br>
<p>In my case it is Phoenix Space Development Corporation trying to outrun
<br>
the deranged SI called the US Gov...
