<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Higher vitamin C levels related to lower mortality from all causes
<br>
<p>By such processes as free radical scavenging, protecting lipid membranes,
<br>
and contributing to collagen and hormone production, vitamin C is involved
<br>
in the prevention of a number of chronic diseases, including heart disease
<br>
and cancer.  In a study to appear in tomorrow's issue of the medical
<br>
journal The Lancet, researchers from Cambridge University in England
<br>
sought to confirm the association between serum vitamin C levels and
<br>
mortality from all causes as well as specifically from cardiovascular
<br>
disease, ischemic heart disease and cancer.   They found an inverse
<br>
correlation between vitamin C levels and all cause mortality over a four
<br>
year period.
<br>
<p>The study participants were part of a prospective population study of men
<br>
and women ages 45 to 79 in the United Kingdom, from whom the researchers
<br>
recruited 19,496 subjects.    At the beginning of the study participants
<br>
were clinically examined and completed a health and lifestyle
<br>
questionnaire and food intake diaries.  Serum ascorbic acid levels were
<br>
measured one year into the study.  Causes of death were followed up and
<br>
validated for four years.
<br>
<p>In the group having the highest serum vitamin C concentrations the risk of
<br>
all cause mortality in the four year period was half that of the group who
<br>
had the lowest vitamin C concentrations.  This inverse relationship of
<br>
ascorbic acid levels to mortality was consistent throughout the different
<br>
levels of ascorbic acid concentration.  Mortality from cardiovascular
<br>
disease and ischemic heart disease was also inversely correlated with
<br>
ascorbic acid levels, as was cancer in men.  Ascorbic acid levels were not
<br>
correlated with a lower risk of cancer death for women during the four
<br>
year period, which the researchers speculated could be related to the
<br>
different types of cancer diagnosed in men and women.
<br>
<p>The increase in serum vitamin C was correlated with an increase in dietary
<br>
consumption of fruits and vegetables. An increase in vitamin C equivalent
<br>
to consuming one extra serving of a fruit or vegetable per day was
<br>
determined to be associated with a 20% reduction in the risk of all-cause
<br>
mortality.  The researchers conclude that small changes in intake of
<br>
vitamin C could have large effects.
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Prevention
<br>
<p>The Vitamin C Controversy
<br>
<p>Does vitamin C cause kidney stones? That's what some doctors still say,
<br>
but a report from Harvard Medical School showed no increased risk of
<br>
kidney stones when evaluating 85,557 women over a 14 year study period.
<br>
This report, published in the April 1999 issue of the Journal of the
<br>
American Society of Nephrology, showed that women who consumed 1500 mg a
<br>
day or more of vitamin C were no more likely to develop kidney stones than
<br>
women who consumed less than 250 mg of vitamin C a day. The study did
<br>
reveal that women who consumed 40 mg or more of vitamin B6 were 34% less
<br>
likely to contract kidney stones compared to women taking fewer than 3 mg
<br>
a day of B6. So now that kidney stone risk has been ruled out, let's look
<br>
at some of the human studies showing positive benefits to vitamin C
<br>
supplementation.
<br>
<p>In the early 1990s, several large population studies showed a reduction in
<br>
cardiovascular disease in those who consumed vitamin C. The media reported
<br>
on some of these findings and this favorable publicity helped push a bill
<br>
through Congress that prevented the FDA from banning high-potency vitamin
<br>
C and other supplements.
<br>
<p>The most significant report emanated in 1992 from UCLA, where it was
<br>
announced that men who took 800 mg a day of vitamin C lived 6 years longer
<br>
than those who consumed the FDA's recommended daily allowance of 60 mg a
<br>
day. The study, which evaluated 11,348 participants over a 10 year period
<br>
of time, showed that high vitamin C intake extended average life span and
<br>
reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease by 42%. This study was
<br>
published in the journal Epidemiology (1992; 3 [3]:194-202).
<br>
<p>The published research findings suggest that vitamin C may reduce
<br>
mortality in coronary artery disease patients, increase life span, and
<br>
possibly eliminate the effects of nitrate tolerance in those taking
<br>
nitrate drugs. While not recognized in the medical establishment as a
<br>
therapy for coronary artery disease, there now exists an accumulated
<br>
wealth of evidence that vitamin C has beneficial effects in the treatment
<br>
of heart-related illnesses.

<p><p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Life Extension Mix
<br>
<p>Since 1983, Life Extension Mix has been reformulated fourteen times to
<br>
reflect new scientific findings about preventing disease and slowing
<br>
premature aging. Foundation members use Life Extension Mix as the
<br>
cornerstone of an overall program to maintain an optimal state of health.
<br>
<p>Life Extension Mix is an antioxidant formula that affords a considerable
<br>
degree of protection against free radicals. In addition, Life Extension
<br>
Mix includes nutrients that: enhance methylation (an essential process
<br>
that declines during aging); inhibit glycosylation (a significant cause of
<br>
aging damage); suppress apolipoprotein serum levels (a cause of
<br>
atherosclerosis); suppress homocysteine serum levels ( a cause of
<br>
cardiovascular disease); suppress mitochondrial oxidative stress (a cause
<br>
of premature aging); protect against thrombosis (abnormal blood clotting
<br>
inside arteries); maintain microcapillary perfusion; and protect against
<br>
DNA mutations that lead to certain cancers.

<p><p>Dual-C
<br>
<p>Fat-soluble vitamin C (ascorbyl palmitate) may be as important as
<br>
water-soluble vitamin C, yet most vitamin consumers have not even heard of
<br>
ascorbyl palmitate. If you take Life Extension Mix, you are receiving a
<br>
potent dose of fat-soluble ascorbyl palmitate. The only vitamin C
<br>
supplement in the world to combine water and fat soluble vitamin C is
<br>
Dual-C. Each capsule of Dual-C contains 609 mg of fully reacted calcium
<br>
ascorbate (gentle on the stomach and supplies calcium) and ascorbyl
<br>
palmitate (to protect fat tissues from autoxidation). Designed and used by
<br>
Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw.

<p>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE
<br>
In the News:  Vitamin Supplements Reduce Cataract Incidence by 60%
<br>
<p>In a study just published in the Archives of Ophthalmology
<br>
[2000;118:1556-1563], researchers examined data from more than 3,000
<br>
people aged 43 to 86 years. Individuals who took a multivitamin or a
<br>
supplement that contained vitamin C or E for more than 10 years had a 60%
<br>
reduced risk of developing a cataract.
<br>
<p>This study showed that the relationship between long-term supplement use
<br>
and lower cataract incidence remained regardless of other known risk
<br>
factors such as smoking, alcohol use, diabetes, age, weight and physical
<br>
activity. Taking multivitamins or supplements for less than 10 years,
<br>
however, did not appear to lower the risk of developing a cataract. The
<br>
fact that short term vitamin supplement use did not reduce cataracts is
<br>
not surprising since eye lens protein degradation develops over an
<br>
extended period.
