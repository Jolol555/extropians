<p>
This is for LINUX savy people/sysadmins.
<br>
<p>Well, I've been trying for a couple of hours to pick up enough
<br>
knowledge to figure upgrade the defective packages.  Here
<br>
is what I've found out.
<br>
<p>The Internet Software Consortium is useless -- doesn't answer
<br>
ftp requests.  So I cannot get a fixed bind v8.2.3 or new v9.1.
<br>
<p>Mandrake has anounced security fixes but they aren't available
<br>
on most mirrors.  Now, I've downloaded to sets of the executables
<br>
I can find from rpmfind.net and fr.rpmfind.net and they fail
<br>
the PGP checks (They also don't match the sizes the distribution
<br>
says they are supposed to be.)
<br>
<p>So, either 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The distribution sites got hosed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The distributed 'rpm' files are actually some compressed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rpm format.
<br>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?
<br>
Does anyone know anything about rpm?
<br>
<p>If so please email me off-list.  If I can get a working set
<br>
of this stuff I'll be happy to mirror it so others can
<br>
get at it easily.
<br>
<p>While messing around with this I've been thinking about the
<br>
problems of verifying that *any* of the programs I'm downloading
<br>
don't contain &quot;trap-doors&quot;.  And you know, I really haven't
<br>
got a clue how one would go about preventing that.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Robert
