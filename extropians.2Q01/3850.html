<p><em>&gt; I take it, Robin, that you criticize the legal system for failing to seek

</em><br>
<p>My criticism, and our discussion of disagreement, applies to *all*
<br>
facts, at all levels of abstraction or aggregation, physical, legal, moral,
<br>
or otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I would emphasize that no mere aesthetic objection to *individuals*

</em><br>
<em>&gt; discredit an *institution* designed to, ... uncover truth.  ...
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  But I still think that exaggeration is a sign of failing to find truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I think this is just not true.  Ordinary people disagree on just about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;everything, e.g., household chores, who likes who, what foods are healthy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;They disagree especially on just about any question of individual ability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;People consistently think themselves more able than others think them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in cooking, driving, kissing, you name it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That, too, is an empirical claim.  I can only say that I know of no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific study on the issue--and that my personal experience seems to vary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely from yours.  Call me a laid-back Californian, but I just don't spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much time around the house or office arguing with people!
</em><br>
<p>Arguing or debating is different from disagreeing.  Ask everyone in your office
<br>
to rank themselves and each other at being a driver, lover, lawyer, whatever.
<br>
I can pretty much guarentee you will find each person tends to rate him/herself
<br>
above median.  You can show all these rankings to everyone and then ask them
<br>
to revise them and the same bias will show up.   You guys might not spend much
<br>
time talking about this, but I think you all know that you disagree about these
<br>
things.
<br>
<p>Btw, I am presently working on an experiment to very clearly show disagreement
<br>
is ubiquitous.  (Too bad most of you guys aren't in my area to come be subjects.)
