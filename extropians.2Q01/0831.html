<p><em>&gt; Courtesy of Doug, I got ambitious today and decided to organize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a reference page for H. Keith Henson.  You may find it at:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Engineering/Henson-HK/">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Engineering/Henson-HK/</a>
</em><br>
<p>Ah, that's great!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've even converted several of the old grungy text documents that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I managed to find to hypertext (I can't believe we once actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read this stuff).  Interestingly several of these were lifted from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointers to Anders' archives (Is there anything Anders doesn't have?)
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Spare time. I would be interested in hearing suggestions for how
<br>
to manage my website(s) more efficiently - right now I put off
<br>
updating them far too much, simply out of time constraints.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, why is Keith the 2nd most famous extropian?  Well I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not doing any &quot;filtering&quot; for identity homonyms.  But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would appear that from Google's point of view:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Anders &gt; Keith &gt; Max &gt; Damien &gt;&gt; yours truly or Greg
</em><br>
<p>Frightening. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, if one of our young computer literate people can figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out how to take the results of these searches and separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them into distinct domains of high similarity, we could resolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these questions defininitively...
</em><br>
<p>I have been thinking for a long time to set up some sociography
<br>
software to parse list traffic and construct a graph of who is
<br>
responding to whom. Might be an interesting way of visualising list
<br>
dynamics. The same might work for the web.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If anyone has any interesting ancecdotes, embarassing photographs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical facts, additional writings, links, etc. that they think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be added to the H.K. Henson page, please forward such to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is a lesson to be learned here -- if you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be &quot;famous&quot; take on a &quot;religion&quot; or two....
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately true. It also points toward the drawback of google-based
<br>
estimates of fame: it only shows &quot;connection-fame&quot;, not
<br>
&quot;relevance-fame&quot;. Although I think Keith ought to have a pretty good
<br>
relevance-fame too, in general being well linked seems to be more
<br>
powerful in making people find you than being right. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One thing that is rather striking is how close Anders comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Ralph Merkle and even Eric Drexler (and he hasn't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got a PhD after his name yet...).
</em><br>
<p>Working on it... :-)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Just a thought regarding Extro5 -- given the recent discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding simulations and ancestor recreations -- should there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be an after-hours video recording session where people spill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their guts to allow the recreation of more accurate simulations?
</em><br>
<p>Sounds a bit like this: <a href="http://members.aol.com/kempelmann/ramcee.html">http://members.aol.com/kempelmann/ramcee.html</a>
<br>
<p>Wouldn't there be a better simulation if the descendants do a boundary
<br>
condition solution with known historical facts? I think having a lot
<br>
of information a timeslice t will not help much with estimating the
<br>
state at slice t +- 1 year, but having some information from say every
<br>
fifth year would make it much easier to estimate the intervening
<br>
states.
