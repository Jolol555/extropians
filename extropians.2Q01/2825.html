<p>
Opportunity.
<br>
Wind of serendipity.
<br>
Let's code an AI.
<br>
<p>The economy burped me out of a job about a month ago, so I've had plenty of
<br>
time to make space in my life.  I will probably be finding something to
<br>
occupy my time in the not-too-distant future.  Until then, I would be
<br>
delighted to dedicate myself to the &quot;Coding a Transhuman AI&quot; project.  Even
<br>
after I regain employment, I would still like to stay committed to the
<br>
cause.
<br>
<p>I love manifesting will.  Let's transmute the abstract into the concrete,
<br>
ideas into actions, concepts into schemes!
<br>
<p>I come from a web applications development background.  I have been wanting
<br>
to migrate towards information theory research and systems architecture.  I
<br>
am fascinated by consciousness, information theory, AI, chaos, complex
<br>
systems, self-organizing systems and biochemistry/biophysics.

<br>
<p>I obviously have a lot of research to do for this project, and should
<br>
probably begin by reading all of CaTAI as well as some of the AI and neural
<br>
networks books on my shelf.  I could parallel process the task of beginning
<br>
some work on information architecture and data modeling for CaTAI, which
<br>
could be leveraged when the time for language definition and coding arrives.
<br>
<p>As far as choosing/creating a language, I think a Prolog-based solution
<br>
would be far superior to LISP or Python.  Also, XML is the standard for
<br>
structured information; it could be instrumental in providing scalability.
<br>
It would be beneficial to make use of XML if only for the sake of
<br>
interoperability with other systems.
<br>
<p>Some relevant links I found tonight...
<br>
on Prolog vs. LISP:

<br>
<p>OK, great... a coding volunteer who's going to begin by burying his face in
<br>
the books.  Well, you might not see immediate results, but at least you know
<br>
someone is on it!
<br>
<p>Yours truly,
<br>
<p>Leonardo Gonzalez
