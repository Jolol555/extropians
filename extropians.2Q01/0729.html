Several people have suggested that our world is indistinguishable from a 
<br>
simulation.  I disagree.  One universal characteristics of simulations is 
<br>
that they simplify.  If you look at any aspect in enough detail (usually not 
<br>
closely at all) it's simple.  This is stunningly different from the real 
<br>
world, in which the closer you look the more complex it gets.  The proposal 
<br>
that the simulation &quot;makes up&quot; detail when required is implausible.  As 
<br>
anyone who's ever GM'd knows, that always leaves you stuck with 
<br>
contradictions.  The necessary work to recalculate the past everytime the 
<br>
simulation gets &quot;caught&quot; would be as bad as doing it right the first time.  
<br>
Finally, the real world is just phenomenally wasteful on calculations.  I'm 
<br>
walking to the laundry this morning and see the light ripples on the pool.  
<br>
The quantum calculations to model the pool would make an SI quake - yet there 
<br>
it is.  Just to look nice to me.  Please.  In the Dysonian universes we're 
<br>
currently forecasting, resources are limited and precious.  
<br>
<p>If the universe is a &quot;simulation&quot; in any sense, it's in a universe much more 
<br>
sophisticated than ours (one that can afford to simulate our universe down to 
<br>
quantum foam - something like 10^200 ops).  The point is much more than our 
<br>
own existence, or else they wouldn't have bothered with the rest of the 
<br>
universe.
