<p>I think this is one of the BIG issues for any transhumanist ethics to
<br>
answer. 
<br>
<p>My own position would be that any system with sufficient level of
<br>
ethical subjectness would have the right to its life, including of
<br>
course the integrity of its own mind. Hence beyond a certain point we
<br>
must ask our AIs permission to modify them.  What medium a being is
<br>
implemented in does not change its ethical status.
<br>
<p>Note that being an ethical subject is a slight cop-out: I still need to
<br>
define it. For the moment let me just handwave and say it implies the
<br>
ability to rationally change behavior as a response to new information
<br>
(that is still rather loose, but defining the details is a whole thread
<br>
in itself). Basing rights on self-awareness, ability to experience pain,
<br>
consciousness or genetic makeup is too arbitrary, as we can imagine
<br>
systems lacking these but still behaving in ways that would be viewed as
<br>
ethical. 
<br>
<p>There are borderline cases when we deal with entities that are not fully
<br>
ethical subjects but quite close to it, such as children, deranged
<br>
people and half-built AIs. In this case partial rights may be necessary
<br>
as other entities are allowed influence over the first entity in order
<br>
to safeguard its personhood and development, but it is a whole
<br>
thead in itself how to best handle that.
