<p><em>&gt;Another way to illustrate why it is best to switch doors after Monte

</em><br>
<p>I guess you know by now that you have completely changed the problem.
<br>
It wouldn't be of any advantage here to change (see Amara's original
<br>
explanation, and Eliezer was right to point out that your new version
<br>
is equivalent to the fourth problem on my list).
<br>
<p>You also write intriguingly,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since we are discussing probabilities and things that can easily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be calculated, heres one for you: suppose you choose a number 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; randomly (x), you know that the probability of its being prime 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is about 1/ln(x). OK, suppose you pick two random primes and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiply them together to get a composite C. What is the probability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that C+2 is prime? Is it still 1/ln(C+2) ?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; The answer to this is not trivial, and it bears directly on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion on page 87 of Damien's updated version of The Spike. spike
</em><br>
<p>I'm lucky to have that book, wherein on page 87, it is related 
<br>
that a certain ominous **Mr. Jones** has determined the rate at
<br>
which very large prime numbers are likely to be discovered.
<br>
Now I would think that surely the probability that C+2 is
<br>
prime is indeed proportional to 1/ln(C+2).  Yes?  It would be
<br>
marvelous if someone had found otherwise.  What's the connection?
