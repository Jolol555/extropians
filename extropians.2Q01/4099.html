<em>&gt; In these times of disposable consumer items, one must ask oneself whether

it is

not a
<br>

and

</em><br>
<p>This is a funny way to look at things. It reminds me of all those companies
<br>
that save money by downsizing essential employees, and find out afterwards
<br>
that they can't turn a profit for some reason. Or, why not lop off your legs
<br>
and get a wheelchair? Surely you'd require less food. Also, one of the arms
<br>
has got to be redundant.
<br>
<p>More seriously, you have an implicit assumption here that survival of the
<br>
species, or survival of intelligent life, or some otherwise defined class,
<br>
is our &quot;supergoal&quot; (to borrow some jargon). Many here would argue that this
<br>
is fundamentally at odds with extropianism, which has a more individualistic
<br>
outlook... we would save ourselves, at the cost of the long term good of the
<br>
species perhaps. Although it is not at all clear that this is a required
<br>
tradeoff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Death is recycling, and nothing is wrong with recycling. Do not be so fond
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; these worthless evolved phobias of death. The focus must be on life, and
</em><br>
death
<br>
<em>&gt; is not the opposite of it, just another aspect of the optimization
</em><br>
process.
<br>
<p>Death is death is death. Natural selection is all well and good, it's gotten
<br>
us this far. However, it's capricious, and it's cruel. The idea that
<br>
intelligent beings would willingly submit themselves to it's tempest, given
<br>
the option to not, is ludicrous.
<br>
<p>I think the point that you are wanting to make is that natural selection is
<br>
more efficient than the alternative, whatever that may be. I don't think
<br>
that's necessarily so. The idea of becoming transhuman is that we can shape
<br>
ourselves as we see fit, and as is best to meet the challenges of our
<br>
environment. We can use many tools to do this, simulated natural selection
<br>
amongst them. Plain vanilla natural selection (ie: kill lots of intelligent
<br>
beings, repeat) is an extremely slow way to improve our fitness in the
<br>
universe. It would be ludicrous to suppose, for example, that you could put
<br>
a population of practically immortal transhumans next to a population of
<br>
naturally evolving humans, and expect the &quot;natural&quot; humans to compete.
<br>
<p>Evolution is fine, fabulous. Natural selection is clumsy, slow, tyranical,
<br>
and incredibly inefficient. Take it down from the pedestal.
