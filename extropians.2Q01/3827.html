<em>&gt;&gt; It's possible that more advanced civilizations try

<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;ecologically&quot; or &quot;environmentally&quot; friendly way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; calculate.  Primitive civilizations, like ours, might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be forgiven for charging ahead irreversibly. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;We could be forgiven then for being a slash and burn
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes. But I really shouldn't have phrased it this way for several reasons.
<br>
One is that we are probably alone in the visible universe.  But more
<br>
importantly, what I was getting at is this: suppose that in the long run
<br>
entropy really is the enemy.  Then thousands of years from now it may
<br>
behoove us to become reversible.  Reversible calculations, of course, do
<br>
not increase entropy.  Yet intelligence and a continually developing
<br>
civilization would not be compromised.  (A nice problem, which I think
<br>
that I know the answer to, is, &quot;are conscious reversible Turing machines
<br>
also conscious when run backwards?&quot;)  By becoming reversible, our
<br>
civilization might lenghten its total life span, if Dyson and
<br>
Tipler turn out to be wrong about the universe sustaining infinite
<br>
computation.
<br>
<p>I have not been entirely successful in resolving the relationship
<br>
between life and entropy (perhaps some here can help).  We say 
<br>
thermodynamically that the energy generated by the sun (which
<br>
drives almost everything else in the solar system) is finally
<br>
dissipated to deep space, and stops off only briefly on Earth.
<br>
Here (and soon throughout the solar system) it supports the creation
<br>
of ordered structures.  So at first glance, life and entropy might
<br>
seem unrelated (given the final entropy production between the sun
<br>
and deep space).  Yet the non-trivial amounts of order created on
<br>
Earth may have to be included in the equation.
<br>
<p>Consider the shadow on the distant stars the Earth makes.  It's
<br>
easy to see that life on Earth may accomplish energy storage,
<br>
so why not neg-entropy storage?
<br>
<p>Certainly the energy storage of prehistoric times (mostly in oil
<br>
I would think) is currently being used for the creation of highly
<br>
ordered artifacts in the human sphere (or noosphere of de Chardin,
<br>
I suppose that we should confess).  Coming up shortly will be
<br>
massive energy expenditures in fusion and fission, which are 
<br>
star power rather than sun power.   But on the whole, (a) has life
<br>
lessened the overall entropy production?  (b) is man's present
<br>
and future enormous energy consumption, which will be used to
<br>
create even more order, hastening or hindering entropy production
<br>
in the solar system?
