<p>Let's say you want to populate an orbital distance R around a planet
<br>
as densely as possible with satellites, such that no two ever come
<br>
closer than distance N from each other. Let's assume non-decaying
<br>
orbits and that they are not constrained to any particular orbital
<br>
angle. What kind of arrangement would these orbits have?
<br>
<p>Related question, maybe the same one-- what is the mathematical
<br>
relationship between the number of intersecting orbital planes (all at
<br>
distance R, but at different angles) and the number of satellites in
<br>
each orbit? In other words, if you just have one orbit, then you can
<br>
pack it with pi*2R/N satellites. If two such orbits intersect, then
<br>
obviously each has to contain fewer satellites (they need to 'take
<br>
turns' going through the two points of intersection) and so on for
<br>
each additional orbit added to the mix, but what is the actual
<br>
relationship?
<br>
<p>I have a hunch that when there are many orbits, it's best to angle
<br>
them such that there are never more than two intersecting. I also have
<br>
a hunch that for each R there is an optimal number of orbits beyond
<br>
which any additional satellite capacity from more orbits would be
<br>
offset by the decrease in the number of satellites each of the orbits
<br>
would have to undergo in order to accomodate the new one. I don't know
<br>
how to evaluate these hunches, but if they are correct, then I can
<br>
sort of envision how a densely populated orbital distance would look--
<br>
sort of like a hollowed out ball of yarn, with relatively large gaps.
<br>
<p>I'm not expecting somebody to actually have the right equation or
<br>
software simulator handy (though of course it would be great if
<br>
somebody did). Any helpful information at all would be appreciated:
<br>
references to books or papers, names of authors, the proper technical
<br>
terms for the question I'm asking, search terms to try, or even the
<br>
name of the subdiscipline/s of math/physics that study these
<br>
questions.
