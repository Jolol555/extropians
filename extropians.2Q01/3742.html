<p>
I enjoyed your paper, Robin, and second Curt Adams' opinion that others (by 
<br>
which I particularly mean, of course, all those people who stubbornly 
<br>
disagree with me) would probably find reading it fruitful.  (See 
<br>
<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf</a> or .doc.)  The exchange at the end proved 
<br>
both illuminating and amusing.
<br>
<p>In contrast to both you and Tyler, however, I am not very troubled by the 
<br>
notion that people agree to disagree, nor--and more to the point--do I 
<br>
conclude that they therefore undervalue truth.  Rather, I regard persistent 
<br>
academic disagreements as analogous to the adversarial legal process, wherein 
<br>
opposing parties deliberately exaggerate their viewpoints in order to 
<br>
facilitate a systemic search for the truth.  I say &quot;analogous&quot; because I 
<br>
believe academic debates (particularly in the sciences) to tend toward truth 
<br>
more reliably and efficiently than legal ones.  To idealize a bit, academics 
<br>
defend opposing views at least in part because they see an epistemic benefit 
<br>
in preserving a diversity of opinion.  You get at this a bit, I think, in 
<br>
your paper's discussion of disagreement as a public good.
<br>
<p>Beyond this, there remains a meta-meta-level good to persistent disagreement: 
<br>
Debating relative trivialities keeps our reasoning facilities fit for 
<br>
important issues.  Consider, for instance, that we agree about almost 
<br>
everything.  That's perhaps an odd thing to say, but only, I think, because 
<br>
we take our nearly universal agreement for granted.  Most conversation, 
<br>
particularly outside of professional and academic contexts, does not involve 
<br>
debate.  (Review, for instance, recent discussion around your household.)  We 
<br>
debate only a very few, usually not very important (e.g., sports), and 
<br>
usually not very easily resolved (e.g., theology) issues.  To give up that 
<br>
jousting would disserve the search for truth, as it prepares us to tackle the 
<br>
few important and resolvable disagreements that really matter.  Such 
<br>
disagreement is not necessarily a per se good (though I do think it proves 
<br>
harmless for the most part), nor necessarily a meta-level good (though it 
<br>
often produces a beneficial side effect of amusement), but may prove a 
<br>
meta-meta-level good by preparing us to seek truth through debate when we 
<br>
really need to do so.
<br>
<p>Still, I agree with you, Robin (and in apparent contrast to your co-author, 
<br>
Tyler), that we should at least try to improve our reasoning methods.  I 
<br>
perhaps disagree with you, however, in thinking that we are rather unlikely 
<br>
to achieve such improvement through individual efforts; I think institutional 
<br>
changes are by far more likely to succeed.
