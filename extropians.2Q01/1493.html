</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not at a velocity that exceed the heat dissipation capacity
</em><br>

<p>The best suggestions along these lines are, as is often the case, in

Drexler's Engines of Creation.  See the notes for chapter six at

<p>Extended quote:
<br>
<p><p>... Robert Forward ... suggests ... See his article &quot;Roundtrip
<br>
Interstellar Travel Using Laser-Pushed Lightsails,&quot; (Journal of
<br>
Spacecraft and Rockets, Vol. 21, pp. 187-95, Jan.-Feb. 1984). Forward
<br>
notes the problem of making a beam-reversal sail light enough, yet of
<br>
sufficient optical quality (diffraction limited) to do its job. An
<br>
actively controlled structure based on thin metal films positioned by
<br>
nanometer-scale actuators and computers seems a workable approach to
<br>
solving this problem. 
<br>
<p>But nanotechnology will allow a different approach to accelerating
<br>
lightsails and stopping their cargo. Replicating assemblers will make it
<br>
easy to build large lasers, lenses, and sails. Sails can be made of a
<br>
crystalline dielectric, such as aluminum oxide, having extremely high
<br>
strength and low optical absorptivity. Such sails could endure intense
<br>
laser light, scattering it and accelerating at many gees, approaching
<br>
the speed of light in a fraction of a year. This will allow sails to
<br>
reach their destinations in near-minimal time. (For a discussion of the
<br>
multi-gee acceleration of dielectric objects, see &quot;Applications of Laser
<br>
Radiation Pressure,&quot; by A. Ashkin [Science, Vol. 210, pp. 1081-88, Dec.
<br>
5, 1980].) 
<br>
<p>In flight, computer-driven assembler systems aboard the sail (powered by
<br>
yet more laser light from the point of departure) could rebuild the sail
<br>
into a long, thin traveling-wave accelerator. This can then be used to
<br>
electrically accelerate a hollow shell of strong material several
<br>
microns in radius and containing about a cubic micron of cargo; such a
<br>
shell can be given a high positive charge-to-mass ratio. Calculations
<br>
indicate that an accelerator 1,000 kilometers long (there's room enough,
<br>
in space) will be more than adequate to accelerate the shell and cargo
<br>
to over 90 percent of the speed of light. A mass of one gram per meter
<br>
for the accelerator (yielding a one-ton system) seems more than
<br>
adequate. As the accelerator plunges through the target star system, it
<br>
fires backward at a speed chosen to leave the cargo almost at rest. (For
<br>
a discussion of the electrostatic acceleration of small particles, see
<br>
&quot;Impact Fusion and the Field Emission Projectile,&quot; by E. R. Harrison
<br>
[Nature, Vol. 291, pp. 472-73, June 11, 1981].) 
<br>
<p>The residual velocity of the projectile can be directed to make it
<br>
strike the atmosphere of a Mars- or Venus-like planet (selected
<br>
beforehand by means of a large space-based telescope). A thin shell of
<br>
the sort described will radiate atmospheric entry heat rapidly enough to
<br>
remain cool. The cargo, consisting of an assembler and nanocomputer
<br>
system, can then use the light of the local sun and local carbon,
<br>
hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen (likely to be found in any planetary
<br>
atmosphere) to replicate and to build larger structures. 
<br>
<p>An early project would be construction of a receiver for further
<br>
instructions from home, including plans for complex devices. These can
<br>
include rockets able to get off the planet (used as a target chiefly for
<br>
its atmospheric cushion) to reach a better location for construction
<br>
work. The resulting system of replicating assemblers could build
<br>
virtually anything, including intelligent systems for exploration. To
<br>
solve the lightsail stopping problem for the massive passenger vehicles
<br>
that might follow, the system could build an array of braking lasers as
<br>
large as the launching lasers back home. Their construction could be
<br>
completed in a matter of weeks following delivery of the cubic-micron
<br>
&quot;seed.&quot; This system illustrates one way to spread human civilization to
<br>
the stars at only slightly less than the speed of light. 
<br>
<p>Hard to top that...
