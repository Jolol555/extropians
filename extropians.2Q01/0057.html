<em>&gt;From: Carlos Gonzalia &lt;<a href="mailto:gonzalia@md.chalmers.se?Subject=Re:%20Argentina%20economy&In-Reply-To=&lt;200103020816.f228G0e01249@pheidippides.md.chalmers.se&gt;">gonzalia@md.chalmers.se</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Same here, particularly considering I'm going back to my country after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;graduation, and try my humblest best to keep the ship from sinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Please do!   (I like your country's writers. :-) )
</em><br>
<p>Ohhh we all do. ;-) The cultural mix has been very rich there on the past 30
<br>
years or so, hence the amazing literary production coming from our writers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I was under the impression that life was improving in Argentina, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps I was wrong. The last few years have been difficult there.
</em><br>
<p>The best description would be that the rate of un-improving has been
<br>
reduced.
<br>
For the big part of the population, life has got way worse, and at a steady
<br>
pace, for the past 10 years or so. As I said, this worsening has been slowed
<br>
down lately, but calling this &quot;improvement&quot; is something only our shameless
<br>
politicians dare to do, hehe...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(I suppose the following is reasonably accurate (?).   )
</em><br>
[snipped out]
<br>
<p>Very much so. Please note the big GDP dropping mentioned in the last part.
<br>
Calling the situation of the provinces &quot;precarious&quot; is a gross
<br>
understatement,
<br>
though. Many provinces (they are legally like states in the US) are simply
<br>
put
<br>
chronic disaster zones, economical and cultural stagnation being rampant. As
<br>
for
<br>
the labor code reform (more properly should be called dragging the code to
<br>
the
<br>
street and shooting it), this has been pretty much done by now. The results
<br>
are
<br>
quite bad for the typical worker, and its impact on unemployment has been
<br>
almost
<br>
nil. The stand-by facility of the IMF, which has been expanded greatly, is
<br>
basically the only thing holding the pieces together and avoiding social
<br>
collapse and worse violence than the already harsh one we have. As is usual
<br>
with
<br>
the IMF, the preconditions imposed on the government's administration have
<br>
included all kinds of nasties, one of them is killing off &quot;unnecessary&quot;
<br>
funding
<br>
for education and health, making the whole prospects of chronical stagnation
<br>
only more probable. Except for the agro-exporting sector (and even there,
<br>
only
<br>
to some extent), our industrial base has shrinked hugely, the main culprit
<br>
being
<br>
Menem's administration and its notorious corruption/incompetence. These guys
<br>
basically sold everything in sight, cheap, to unscrupulous foreign capitals
<br>
mainly interested in scraping off all physical stock and running away. The
<br>
ones
<br>
who did stay have only bothered to invest enough to keep their companies
<br>
working, and then abusing customers with all kinds of monopolistic tactics
<br>
plus
<br>
increasing their prices as the only resource for every thing not working
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>Since I come from the academic sector, that is the part I'm most familiar
<br>
with.
<br>
As the message is a bit OT as it is, I'm not sure if embarking in a lengthy
<br>
description of the ruinous state of higher education and research in
<br>
Argentina.
<br>
Are you people interested in reading about it?
