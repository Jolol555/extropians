<em>&gt;From Eliezer S Yudkowsky
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Not necessarily.  I know that the limiting speed of my own typing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is more often thought speed than typing speed - certainly for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stuff like &quot;Friendly AI&quot;, less so for code.  I don't really try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;push my speed all that often - in fact, I'm trying to push it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right now and it's an interesting experience - I just type at an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ordinary relaxed rate.  Dvorak is certainly much more relaxing if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that's what you're doing, and it's also possible to push yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without breaking your fingers in half.
</em><br>
<p>I was going to mention earlier that in my case it also has to do
<br>
with &quot;I don't often think that fast&quot;. I learned to type on a manual
<br>
Royal 440.
<br>
<p>I took speed reading when I was younger, and soon ran into the
<br>
problem with comprehending difficult material. I was at a party one
<br>
time (my place) and someone was bragging that he could speed read
<br>
anything.... I handed him a copy of R. Buckminster Fuller's
<br>
&quot;Synergetics, Volume 1&quot;. 
<br>
<p>I won the bet.
<br>
<p>My earlier experiences with speed reading led to one of my favorite
<br>
slogans. &quot;Anything that can be speed read, should be.....&quot;
