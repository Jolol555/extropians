<p><p>The Final Freedom
<br>
<p>By ALAN WOLFE
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p>Should I lie or tell the truth? Is my marriage vow binding? Ought I give in 
<br>
when temptation calls? To whom are my obligations strongest? To answer such 
<br>
questions, Americans have traditionally relied on time-tested moral rules, 
<br>
usually handed down by a supreme being, that command obedience and punish 
<br>
defiance. Now we live in an age of moral freedom, in which individuals are 
<br>
expected to determine for themselves what it means to lead a good and 
<br>
virtuous life. We decide what is right and wrong, not by bending our wills 
<br>
to authority, but by considering who we are, what others require and what 
<br>
consequences follow from acting one way rather than another.
<br>
This country has always experienced freedom, but only recently has it 
<br>
discovered moral freedom. In the 19th century, principles of economic 
<br>
liberty were instrumental in creating a society in which the right to own 
<br>
property, to hire workers and to manufacture and dispose of goods was 
<br>
accepted as the most productive way for a society to create and distribute 
<br>
its wealth. This was followed, in the 20th century, by the spread of 
<br>
political freedom. By century's end, the idea that people had a right to 
<br>
vote and to run for office -- and that such a right could not be denied them 
<br>
on the basis of ownership of property, race or gender -- had become so 
<br>
widely accepted that no society could be considered good unless its 
<br>
political system was organized along democratic lines.
<br>
<p><p>Although political freedoms are enormously important, they are restricted to 
<br>
one sphere of human activity: obtaining and exercising political power. The 
<br>
same is true of economic freedom, which, by definition, is limited to such 
<br>
essential, but also essentially mundane, matters like the buying and selling 
<br>
of commodities. Moral freedom involves the sacred as well as the profane; it 
<br>
is freedom over the things that matter most. The ultimate implication of the 
<br>
idea of moral freedom is not that people are created in the image of a 
<br>
higher authority. It is that any form of higher authority has to tailor its 
<br>
commandments to the needs of real people. It cannot be surprising that 
<br>
Americans made a best seller out of a book -- actually three books -- called 
<br>
&quot;Conversations With God.&quot;
<br>
<p>Even the most traditional Americans have been touched by the spread of moral 
<br>
freedom. Born-again Christians generally do not believe that people should 
<br>
be free to live as they choose, especially when they choose what 
<br>
evangelicals consider sinful: homosexuality, for example, or premarital sex. 
<br>
Yet evangelicals are also people who often reject the religion of their 
<br>
upbringing, opt for start-up churches and prefer to home-school their 
<br>
children, giving them more in common than they realize with gays and 
<br>
lesbians who have redefined marriage and family and founded houses of 
<br>
worship that serve their own spiritual needs. Conservative millionaires may 
<br>
vote Republican because they believe America lost its Christian standards 
<br>
under Bill Clinton, but they probably obtained their millions living by 
<br>
rules of corporate loyalty, equity and honesty that Christians generations 
<br>
ago would have called sinful.
<br>
<p>Moral freedom is so radical an idea, so disturbing in its implications, that 
<br>
it has never had much currency among any but a few of the West's great moral 
<br>
theorists. Even those who made passionate arguments in defense of freedom in 
<br>
general did not extend their arguments to moral freedom. Indeed, the common 
<br>
position among most Western thinkers has been to argue the necessity for 
<br>
moral constraint as a precondition for freedom in all other aspects of life. 
<br>
This was most true of conservatives who justified the received authority of 
<br>
church, prince, law or nature. But it was also true of liberal thinkers like 
<br>
John Locke and Immanuel Kant, for whom liberty made sense only when shaped 
<br>
by pre-existing religious or ethical commandments. Timeless, transcendental, 
<br>
absolute -- morality stood in the sharpest possible contrast to freedom, 
<br>
which was transient, inconsistent and dependent on mere circumstance. Even 
<br>
in America, despite the celebratory individualism of an Emerson or a 
<br>
Whitman, the idea of moral freedom made little sense until very recent 
<br>
times. When Franklin Roosevelt in 1941 announced the four freedoms -- of 
<br>
speech, of worship, from want, from fear -- moral freedom was not among 
<br>
them. When, in 1957, the United States Supreme Court finally got around to 
<br>
talking about sexual freedom -- calling sex &quot;a great and mysterious force in 
<br>
human life,&quot; which was &quot;a subject of absorbing interest&quot; -- it did so in the 
<br>
context of upholding a conviction for violating obscenity laws.
<br>
<p>In the 1960's and 1970's, for the first time in American history, a number 
<br>
of thinkers began to take the idea of moral freedom seriously, and enough 
<br>
people paid them attention to mount a significant challenge against moral 
<br>
authority. Reviewing the history of religion in America since the first 
<br>
Spanish and French settlements, the historian Sidney Ahlstrom concluded that 
<br>
&quot;only in the 1960's would it become apparent that the Great Puritan Epoch in 
<br>
American history had come to an end.&quot; If nothing is so powerful as an idea 
<br>
whose time has come, the idea of moral freedom, when it finally came, was 
<br>
powerful enough, at least for a time, to sweep all before it.
<br>
<p>Because moral freedom is so new an idea, it inevitably arouses opposition. 
<br>
There is a widespread feeling that the legacy of the 1960's has been 
<br>
corrosive to the American social fabric. Disrespectful of established 
<br>
authority, cut off from tradition, unattached to family or faith, Americans, 
<br>
we have been repeatedly told, embraced moral freedom only to experience 
<br>
painful results. To discover whether such charges resonate among Americans 
<br>
themselves, I assembled a research team and spent the last couple of years 
<br>
talking with people from all walks of life about what it means to lead a 
<br>
good and virtuous life. We concentrated on four virtues that have been 
<br>
praised by theologians and philosophers for their moral seriousness: 
<br>
honesty, loyalty, forgiveness and self-discipline. Are critics of our 
<br>
condition right to worry that we no longer believe in the old-fashioned 
<br>
virtues that once made us great? Or should we celebrate the arrival of moral 
<br>
freedom for the same reasons we have come to accept economic and political 
<br>
freedom: society is better off when people decide for themselves the right 
<br>
thing to do rather than have it decided for them by others?
<br>
<p>We need not, and should not, take the thoughts of ordinary Americans as the 
<br>
final word on our condition. But, as the reaction to recent events ranging 
<br>
from the school shootings in Santee, Calif., to the presidential pardons 
<br>
demonstrate, there is moral talk aplenty in America; if talk about morality 
<br>
were only a measure of morality, we would be hearing about a moral surplus, 
<br>
not a moral deficit. The least we can do, before we stand up to preach, is 
<br>
to listen to what Americans have to say.
<br>
<p>&quot;There's nothing like loading a few coffins,&quot; a retired Air Force officer 
<br>
told us of his service in Vietnam. &quot;It turned my life around.&quot; Now working 
<br>
as a substitute teacher and occasional lecturer outside Dayton, Ohio, he 
<br>
worries that his country recently has become too soft and self-indulgent. 
<br>
&quot;The wonderful thing about democracy and capitalism is that they lead to the 
<br>
good life, as Aristotle would want us to have it,&quot; he says. But the problem 
<br>
&quot;is that we tend to lose focus on the virtues,&quot; the most important of which 
<br>
are &quot;hard work, dedication and sacrifice.&quot;
<br>
<p>As much as this man's views resonate with ideas of America's decline from a 
<br>
more virtuous age, his defense of self-discipline was decidedly uncommon 
<br>
among our respondents. &quot;You can be disciplined in a bad way,&quot; said one woman 
<br>
in Tipton, Iowa. &quot;You work 70, 80 hours a week, ignoring your family. I 
<br>
don't think that is good self-discipline.&quot; Good self-discipline makes room 
<br>
for obligations to others. In a paradoxical way, it also involves 
<br>
obligations to the self. Many people told us that the person who indulges 
<br>
from time to time is more likely to be productive than the obsessive 
<br>
workaholic.
<br>
<p>St. Augustine wrote that it is always wrong to lie. But the people with whom 
<br>
we spoke believe that you are under a greater obligation to be honest to a 
<br>
friend than to a stranger -- and that you are under no obligation at all to 
<br>
be honest to someone who is dishonest to you. Honesty is not a 
<br>
one-size-fits-all virtue. Many of the gay men with whom we spoke in San 
<br>
Francisco did not believe in loyalty to their sexual partners, but, 
<br>
determined not to hide their sexual orientation, were among the most 
<br>
passionate believers in honesty. Other respondents felt that there are times 
<br>
when honesty can be a vice. &quot;You know,&quot; said a San Francisco therapist, 
<br>
&quot;people say terrible things and then they go, 'Well, I was just being 
<br>
honest.&quot;' In her view, a person of good character would rank sensitivity to 
<br>
others higher than honesty to them.
<br>
<p>Whatever the virtue, Americans will be more practical than principled. An 
<br>
engineer in Silicon Valley talked about the problem of marital loyalty as if 
<br>
he were tinkering with a stubborn software program: &quot;Is it irretrievably 
<br>
broken or can you patch it up? Was there a basis for the marriage in the 
<br>
first place? Is there a basis for working together as part of a team to move 
<br>
ahead from where you are and ignore the past?&quot; A divorced woman in Hartford 
<br>
believes in forgiveness, not out of a recognition that even sinners may 
<br>
nonetheless be good in the eyes of God, but &quot;because when we don't forgive, 
<br>
it holds us back, it eats away at us.&quot;
<br>
<p>As they decide for themselves the best way to live, people can and do 
<br>
consult traditional sources of moral wisdom. Our respondents mentioned not 
<br>
only popular television programs and self-help books but also the example of 
<br>
Jesus Christ, philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to Kant and William 
<br>
James, novelists like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jane Austen and Alexander 
<br>
Solzhenitsyn and theologians including Teilhard de Chardin and Rabbi Hillel. 
<br>
Still, listening to their reasoning gives a certain credibility to those who 
<br>
argue that contemporary Americans have too much freedom for their own good. 
<br>
Our respondents are guided by subjective feelings more than they are by 
<br>
appeals to rational, intellectual and objective conceptions of right and 
<br>
wrong. They do not think that virtue consists in subsuming their needs and 
<br>
desires to the authority of tradition. Indeed, some of them are not even 
<br>
sure that virtuous is what they want to be. Without firm moral instruction, 
<br>
Americans approach the virtues gingerly. They recognize their importance but 
<br>
reinvent their meaning to make sense of the situations in which they find 
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>Just because Americans may be living &quot;after virtue&quot; -- to use the evocative 
<br>
words of the moral philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre -- does not, however, mean 
<br>
that they are living before vice. Both conservatives and liberals see a 
<br>
direct link between the 1960's and now. From the point of view of those 
<br>
aghast at what the 1960's have bequeathed us, one mistake -- the wrong drug 
<br>
or, later, the wrong sex partner -- and life itself could be threatened. 
<br>
<em>&gt;From the point of view of those who embraced the social changes of that 
</em><br>
time, one too many concessions to established institutions of authority, and 
<br>
freedom itself could be sacrificed. Yet for the people with whom we spoke, 
<br>
the 1960's -- understood as a political movement designed to challenge the 
<br>
status quo in favor of revolutionary transformations in lifestyle -- barely 
<br>
exist. Even in San Francisco, despite the fact that we asked people 
<br>
questions about the most morally contentious issues of the day, only a 
<br>
couple of our respondents reflected on what the tumultuous events of those 
<br>
years meant for them and for their country.
<br>
<p>The debate over the 1960's confuses two different phenomena. One is the 
<br>
freedom to choose how to live. The other is the freedom to consider oneself 
<br>
unbound by moral rules. The Americans with whom we have spoken make a pretty 
<br>
clear distinction between choice and unboundedness. The former, they usually 
<br>
insist, is something worth having. And the latter, most of them feel, is 
<br>
something worth avoiding. When Americans think of the kind of moral anarchy 
<br>
and irresponsibility that conservatives associate with the excesses of the 
<br>
1960's, they do not think about their own lives but about the wild lives of 
<br>
Hollywood celebrities, the self-centered actions of corporations and the 
<br>
dishonesty exhibited by politicians.
<br>
<p>Moderate in economics and politics, our respondents are, for the most part, 
<br>
moderate in morality. The great bulk of them no longer adhere to traditional 
<br>
ideas about virtue and vice, but neither do they live as moral libertines. 
<br>
They do not take their marriage vows as binding under all circumstances and 
<br>
for all time, but they often approach the question of divorce in a morally 
<br>
serious way, reserving it as an option when the price of excessive loyalty 
<br>
is unwanted cruelty toward spouse or child. They are not as loyal as they 
<br>
once were in the workplace, but only after being provoked into that position 
<br>
by extensive, and often ruthless, disloyalty on the part of their employers. 
<br>
In their effort to find balance in all things, they forgive to get on with 
<br>
life but do not forget wrongs done to them and do not relativize away acts 
<br>
they consider evil.
<br>
<p>The concept of moral freedom corresponds to a deeply held populist suspicion 
<br>
of authority and a corresponding belief that people know their own best 
<br>
interest. Historically, populist impulses expressed themselves in politics; 
<br>
Americans distrusted elites, especially those whose power appeared to rest 
<br>
on breeding and connections, in favor of appeals to the common man. Now that 
<br>
same populist sensibility extends to all kinds of institutions; if Americans 
<br>
have learned to obtain a second opinion concerning their medical condition, 
<br>
they are also likely to seek additional opinions concerning their moral 
<br>
condition. As radical an idea as this may seem to those once issued commands 
<br>
and expected to obey them, second-opinion morality seeks to work with, not 
<br>
against, the institutions that make social life possible.
<br>
<p>In an age of moral freedom, moral authority has to justify its claims to 
<br>
special insight. Religion offers the best window into the ways such 
<br>
justifications are likely to take place. More and more Americans are 
<br>
redefining God to suit their own tastes and inclinations: Christian 
<br>
ministers who draw upon the Jewish tradition, Reform Jews seeking 
<br>
gender-inclusive language and Americans of all faiths who borrow from every 
<br>
religion and none simultaneously. Whatever emerges from the efforts on the 
<br>
parts of so many Americans to redefine their faith, it is unlikely to 
<br>
resemble Jonathan Edwards's Northampton, the urban parishes of 1950's 
<br>
Catholicism, the revival meetings of Billy Sunday or synagogue life on the 
<br>
Lower East Side.
<br>
<p>Yet the desire of so many Americans to have a greater say in the moral 
<br>
choices they make is anything but a bitter renunciation of religion. It is 
<br>
more likely to take the form of a prayer that someone in a position of 
<br>
religious authority will take them seriously as individuals with minds and 
<br>
desires of their own. Far from being secular humanists, Americans want faith 
<br>
and freedom simultaneously. That would seem like an odd combination to 
<br>
Europeans, for whom faith has often meant dogma and freedom has often meant 
<br>
dissent. But it suggests that in America, religious institutions will not 
<br>
break under the weight of moral freedom but bend, as many of them have bent 
<br>
already, to accommodate themselves to the freedom of moral choice to which 
<br>
Americans have increasingly grown accustomed.
<br>
<p>What is true of religious institutions applies to other institutions like 
<br>
schools, if from the opposite direction. In the spirit of the 1960's, 
<br>
educational reformers began to advocate radical changes in education, 
<br>
proposing that schools should stop disciplining students, encourage 
<br>
free-form expression and individual creativity, de-emphasize honors classes 
<br>
and tracking and find new ways to teach such subjects as math and history. 
<br>
In extreme versions of educational reform, moral anarchy rather than moral 
<br>
freedom seemed to be the operating principle, as if schooling itself ought 
<br>
to be abolished. So powerful were the forces behind educational reform that 
<br>
in most established school districts, one version or another of educational 
<br>
reform produced schools that no longer resembled the strict, segregated, 
<br>
vocational and prayer-infused institutions of the 1950's.
<br>
<p>Americans today want second opinions about both what and how their children 
<br>
learn in schools. Resisting the influence of liberal school administrators 
<br>
with as much determination as they resist the messages of conservative 
<br>
religious moralists, those who support greater school choice through 
<br>
vouchers and charter schools see freedom of choice as a way of encouraging 
<br>
greater institutional responsibility. Those who continue to support public 
<br>
schooling often express a desire for higher standards and an insistence on 
<br>
the value of teaching character. If American schools move in a more 
<br>
&quot;conservative&quot; direction toward discipline, it will be for the same reasons 
<br>
that churches move in a more &quot;liberal&quot; direction of therapeutic inclusion. 
<br>
After anarchy, moral freedom can be a requirement for re-establishing 
<br>
authority.
<br>
<p>In a time of moral freedom, no institution will be able to stick its head in 
<br>
the sand and pretend that the people who approach it for advice and guidance 
<br>
can be treated as supplicants. Morality has long been treated as if it were 
<br>
a fixed star, sitting there far removed from the earthly concerns of real 
<br>
people, meant to guide them to the true and the beautiful. In the 
<br>
contemporary world, however, people experience in their own lives many 
<br>
situations for which traditional conceptions of morality offer little 
<br>
guidance: what do you do when the pursuit of one virtue conflicts with 
<br>
another? How do you apply moral precepts to situations unforeseen by those 
<br>
religious and philosophical traditions developed for another time and place? 
<br>
Can seemingly unambiguous moral principles be capable of multifaceted 
<br>
interpretations? Faced with such real-world conflicts, many Americans will 
<br>
say, as did one of our respondents in San Antonio: &quot;Somebody can't make you 
<br>
do something you don't want to do. You know, you draw your own guidelines.&quot;
<br>
<p>No matter how strong their religious and moral beliefs, nearly all people 
<br>
will encounter situations in which they will feel such a need to participate 
<br>
in interpreting, applying and sometimes redefining the rules meant to guide 
<br>
them. Are they somehow less moral if they do? Telling them that they are 
<br>
will cut no ice with a gay couple determined to legalize their union in an 
<br>
era of widespread heterosexual divorce, with women who find that a too-early 
<br>
marriage stultifies their desire to become more autonomous later in life or 
<br>
with religious believers who find that the best way to express one's faith 
<br>
in God is to reject traditional denominations.
<br>
<p>Because we can never know what freedom will bring in its wake, defenders of 
<br>
social order have never been all that comfortable with any of the forms 
<br>
taken by freedom in the modern world. Economic freedom did not create a 
<br>
hoped-for society of independent yeomen but a regime of mass consumption. 
<br>
Political freedom did not result in active and enlightened civic 
<br>
participation but in voter apathy. In a similar way, moral freedom is highly 
<br>
unlikely to produce a nation of individuals exercising their autonomy with 
<br>
the serious and dispassionate judgment of Immanuel Kant. Yet moral freedom 
<br>
is as inevitable as it is impossible. Critics of America's condition insist 
<br>
on the need to return to the morality of yesterday, but it may be better, 
<br>
given its inevitability, to think of moral freedom as a challenge to be met 
<br>
rather than as a condition to be cured.
<br>
<p>Alan Wolfe is the director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American 
<br>
Public Life at Boston College. His new book, &quot;Moral Freedom,&quot; from which 
<br>
this essay is adapted, will be published next month by W.W. Norton.
