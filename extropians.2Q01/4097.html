<em>&gt; There is indeed this disparity.  However, neither of the sides in this

<em>&gt; dispute believes that her work about sex life in Samoa was correct.
</em><br>
<p>By the way, my own view of Margaret Mead is that she was VERY smart and
<br>
intuitive and had a lot of great insights.  However, she also made a lot of
<br>
bad mistakes.
<br>
<p>Comparing her impact to that of Karl Marx is a bit silly, in my view.
<br>
<p>As a social theorist, Marx was much deeper than Mead, and had far MORE
<br>
profound insights.  He introduced the notion of class into social discourse,
<br>
which is a major contribution much greater than anything Mead contributed.
<br>
But, Marx also made a lot of very bad errors, of course.  More so than Mead,
<br>
he tried to force the diversity of human affairs into a narrow theoretical
<br>
framework (based on Hegel), and it just didn't work, even though it led to
<br>
some interesting ideas.
<br>
<p>However, unlike Mead, Marx had a huge impact on world affairs, which appears
<br>
to have been on balance a rather negative effect (although this is obviously
<br>
hard to fully assess, since we don't really know what the most probable
<br>
course of world events would have been had &quot;Marxism&quot; never existed).
