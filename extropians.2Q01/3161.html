<em>&gt; Accepting that there is any higher power, while there is evil,

<p><p>#Not voting one way or the other on &quot;higher power,&quot; but this line of

reasoning contains an unwarranted assumption--that any higher power

is not only good and moral, but in fact shares &quot;our&quot; concept of

morality. Put bluntly--who says it gives a damn?

<p>#If we/the universe was created by an intelligence, it was most

likely done for its own purposes, and not our own.

<p>#Simple example: Higher power feels life is superior to nonlife, puts 
<br>
known universe into motion with conditions conducive to life--then 
<br>
splits, on to the next project, figuring the little buggers are lucky 
<br>
to be here at all...

<em>&gt; &gt; What do extropians consider to be the most common errors made by

</em><br>
<em>&gt; power.  If one believes or accepts that there is already some higher

<em>&gt; power (Gods, ETs or whatever) out there hiding from us, yet watching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and occasionally influencing our existence, while there is still evils
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like isolation, suffering, death... is just the opposite of faith and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope.  Accepting that there is any higher power, while there is evil,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the ultimate in giving up in despair.  If such really does already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist we are eternally screwed and we have no hope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	If one accepts that there is already a higher power, then one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must spend his days trying to theodicies or justify evil in the face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this higher power.  If one accepts this, they have no hope of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcoming evil, even if they become as powerful as this higher power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For if this higher, even all powerful being, can't do it, how can we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever hope to do any better!?  The theist spends all his days in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; futile effort trying to come up with various absurd theodicies in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to justify it and their already all powerful God.  They can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope to overcome evil, so they must instead try to justify it and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how attempt to try to twist it into being good.  The theist can't hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to overcome evil, but instead merely attempts to justify and accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	But if you &quot;hope&quot; there isn't already a higher power, then and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only then can you have &quot;faith&quot; that perhaps such evils aren't all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to overcome and aren't all that necessary.  You can work with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith and hope that we are about to overcome all such evils.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	A theists that claims to have faith and hope is a liar.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atheist is the only one that can have true and honest faith and hope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	Despite how blatantly obvious this is, for some reason, no one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can see it.
