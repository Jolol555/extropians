<em>&gt; &gt; Now, given that a lot of the political conflicts, famines, and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unpleasantnesses we live with today are scarcity-related, doesn't it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make sense to try to understand how two thirds of the human species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will respond to technologies that promise to make most of the roots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conflict magically go away?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, I think people immature enough to truly believe in &quot;technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that promise to make most of the roots of conflict magically go away&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't belong in science or technology,
</em><br>
<p>Like it or not, that's the impression of the benefits of nanotechnology
<br>
that goes over first via the press, especially in their most gee-whiz
<br>
mode. 
<br>
<p>And that's the impression that's going to go over to the teeming billions,
<br>
because many of them don't have the rationalist education to absorb anything
<br>
deeper. Science and technology *are* seen as magic by many people, even
<br>
today.
<br>
<p>(Would you rather they picked up the equivalent of the green sky-is-falling
<br>
evil-GM-will-kill-us meme?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;                    .... Scarcity has never been the problem. Just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite; overpopulation creates social problems. Politics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distribution failures produce scarcity, but that has to do with misuse of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology rather than any lack of technology itself.
</em><br>
<p>No disagreement, other than to add that economic problems also arise from
<br>
political ones. And saying &quot;the invisible hand will correct things&quot; is
<br>
simply begging the question -- what happens during the &quot;correction&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Just because you don't approve of somebody's beliefs, it does not follow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that you can safely ignore them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I understand it, extropy has nothing to do with &quot;approving&quot; beliefs. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to do with science and technology... which needs to ignore belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems in order to remain objective.
</em><br>
<p>Technology is a tool. The uses to which it is put are highly dependent on
<br>
the social, religious, and political beliefs of the users. (The uses to
<br>
which it *can* be put are determined by the laws of nature, I'll grant
<br>
you.) The point is, how the technologies are deployed (or not) depends on
<br>
what people want to do with them. Which in turn depends on their pre-
<br>
existing beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The danger lies not in ignoring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief systems, but rather in taking them seriously. As long as we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still laugh at the absurdities of religion,
</em><br>
<p>You're staking out a very dangerous position here -- assuming that
<br>
everybody shares your contempt for religious thinking. Most people
<br>
don't. In fact, if they associate such attitudes with the new technologies,
<br>
they'll reject the technologies, because their value system (however
<br>
skewed you think it is) will lead them to conclude that those technologies
<br>
are inimical.
<br>
<p>Do you think you can manage to disentangle your own personal beliefs from
<br>
your analysis of how people who don't share those beliefs might behave?
<br>
Otherwise, we aren't going to have a very fruitful discussion.
