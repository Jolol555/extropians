2. ASTROBIOLOGY: ON THE SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly 30 years ago, Carl Sagan (1934-1996) wrote the
<br>
following: &quot;Civilizations hundreds or thousands or millions of
<br>
years beyond us should have sciences and technologies so far
<br>
beyond our present capabilities as to be indistinguishable from
<br>
magic. It is not that what they can do violates the laws of
<br>
physics; it is that we will not understand how they are able to
<br>
use the laws of physics to do what they do. It is possible that
<br>
we are so backward and so uninteresting to such civilizations as
<br>
not to be worthy of contact, or at least of much contact. There
<br>
may be a few specialists in primitive planetary societies who
<br>
receive master's or doctor's degrees in studying Earth or
<br>
listening to our raspy radio and television traffic. There may be
<br>
amateurs -- Boy Scouts, radio hams, and the equivalent -- who may
<br>
be interested in developments on Earth. But a civilization a
<br>
million years in our future is unlikely, I believe, to be very
<br>
interested in us. There are all those other civilizations a
<br>
million years in our future for them to talk to.&quot; [*Note #1]
<br>
... ... T.L. Wilson (Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy,
<br>
Bonn, DE) presents a review of some current considerations
<br>
concerning the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, the
<br>
author making the following points:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The author points out that N.S. Kardashev, in 1964,
<br>
classified possible extraterrestrial civilizations according to
<br>
the energy at their disposal, the scheme permitting a
<br>
determination of whether, in a context of communication, we would
<br>
be dealing with a civilization like our own (type I), a rather
<br>
advanced civilization (type II), or a vastly more advanced
<br>
civilization (type III). The transmission power of a type I
<br>
civilization is equal to the power expendable by all the
<br>
technological activity on Earth. For a specific direction, this
<br>
can be achieved by coupling the output of a 1 megawatt
<br>
transmitter operating at 10 centimeters to a 100-meter-diameter
<br>
telescope. The transmission power of a type II civilization is
<br>
the entire output of the Sun, which is equal to 10^(14) times a
<br>
type I transmission. The transmission power of a type III
<br>
civilization is equal to the power from our entire Galaxy, or
<br>
10^(11) times a type II signal.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The author points out that humanity has sufficient
<br>
resources at present to broadcast messages comparable to a type I
<br>
civilization in a specific direction, although in practice the
<br>
types of transmission are based on isotropic radiators. A type II
<br>
transmission might be transmitted by an extraterrestrial
<br>
civilization that had captured all of the power from its central
<br>
star. Such extraterrestrial civilizations are often referred to
<br>
as &quot;Dyson civilizations&quot;. Type III civilizations have captured
<br>
the power of an entire galaxy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The author points out that F.D. Drake, in 1965, proposed
<br>
what is now called the &quot;Drake equation&quot; as an attempt to quantify
<br>
estimates of the number of extraterrestrial civilizations. The
<br>
equation takes the form N = RanbcdL, where (N) is the number of
<br>
extraterrestrial civilizations in a galaxy communicating at any
<br>
given time, (R) is the average rate of galactic star formation,
<br>
(a) is the fraction of stars accompanied by planets, (n) is the
<br>
number of planets per star system with conditions needed to
<br>
support life, (b) is the fraction of habitable planets on which
<br>
life actually arises, (c) is the fraction of the life-bearing
<br>
planets that develop intelligent life, (d) is the fraction of
<br>
intelligent species that develop communication technologies, and
<br>
(L) is the &quot;life-span&quot; of the communicating technological
<br>
culture.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) The author points out that stars are concentrated in
<br>
galaxies, and there are more than 20 galaxies within 3 million
<br>
light years of our own Galaxy. In principle, we should be able to
<br>
receive a message from type II or type III extraterrestrial
<br>
civilizations in any of these galaxies with technology currently
<br>
available. With an average of 10^(10) Sun-like stars per galaxy,
<br>
we could detect messages from extraterrestrial civilizations even
<br>
if the product of the last 5 terms in the Drake equation were
<br>
less than 1 part in 10^(8). The author suggests these
<br>
considerations provide a rationale for all-sky untargeted
<br>
searches: With the possibility of at least modest numbers of
<br>
perhaps readily detectable extraterrestrial civilizations
<br>
(especially of type II or type III), the extra sensitivity
<br>
conferred by targeted searches would not be an absolute
<br>
requirement for success. However, the fact remains that no
<br>
confirmed transmissions in the centimeter-wavelength range have
<br>
been received, from which it has been claimed that type II and
<br>
type III extraterrestrial civilizations do not exist at the
<br>
present epoch. The author suggests this claim is overstated: it
<br>
may be valid for a sizeable part of our Galaxy, but only if the
<br>
extraterrestrial civilizations are broadcasting in the
<br>
centimeter-wavelength range without interruption -- and if they
<br>
wish their signals to be detectable.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) The author points out that there is an advantage in
<br>
transmitting signals at short wavelengths, and this explains the
<br>
interest in optical searches for extraterrestrial intelligence.
<br>
The author suggests the following example illustrates the
<br>
advantages of optical searches in regard to effective radiated
<br>
power: An extraterrestrial civilization orbiting a Sun-like star
<br>
could use a laser to illuminate a 1-meter optical telescope
<br>
through narrow-band optical filters. The extraterrestrial
<br>
civilization could then produce a short pulse lasting 1
<br>
microsecond or less, and this would produce a flash 300,000 times
<br>
as bright as their Sun. Even without optical filtering, the flash
<br>
would still be 30 times as bright as their Sun, and this factor
<br>
would rise to 3000 if the diameter of the telescope were
<br>
increased to 10 meters (the diameter of our current Keck
<br>
telescopes). Because of the short pulse length, such optical
<br>
signals would not be found in conventional optical astronomical
<br>
surveys.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) The author points out that if extraterrestrial
<br>
civilizations exist, they are not making their presence obvious.
<br>
This in itself suggests that type III and perhaps type II
<br>
civilizations are at best extremely rare. There are, however,
<br>
many possible reasons why we have not made contact with
<br>
extraterrestrial civilizations: a) They may simply be very few.
<br>
b) There may be a number of extraterrestrial civilizations, but
<br>
these may be sending messages in optical or near-infrared ranges
<br>
that we have to explore comprehensively. c) There may be
<br>
extraterrestrial civilizations, but these may not be interested
<br>
in communicating and choose to keep themselves hidden. This is
<br>
more speculative, since it depends on the cultural aspects of
<br>
extraterrestrial civilizations. From searches so far, the lack of
<br>
contact demonstrates that transmissions, if any, involve weak or
<br>
intermittent signals (or both).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7) The author suggests there seems to be no hope for faster-
<br>
than-light travel, so actual visits from extraterrestrial
<br>
civilization are unlikely. Even with the most efficient
<br>
propulsion systems, the energy needed to reach stars at 10 light
<br>
years in 20 years would be the equivalent of the present world
<br>
consumption for 1000 years. Such expenditure of energy would
<br>
hardly deter a type III extraterrestrial civilization, but even
<br>
then, broadcasts make more energetic sense than personal
<br>
appearances. There have been suggestions that extraterrestrial
<br>
civilizations might populate space with self-replicating machines
<br>
in space probes. This would allow colonization of large regions
<br>
of space in relatively short intervals of time, but it seems
<br>
vastly more complex than communicating by means of
<br>
electromagnetic radiation.

<br>
PROSPECTS FOR THE SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE
<br>
The conjured image is poignant: intelligent life sprinkled
<br>
throughout our Galaxy, each sprinkle separated from the others by
<br>
1000 light years, each sprinkle searching for the others with
<br>
radio transmitters and receivers, small robotic spacecraft sent
<br>
beeping into empty space between the stars, the beeping like a
<br>
faint bleating in the dark as the sprinkles search for each
<br>
other. Of course, the conjured image may be wrong: there may be
<br>
intelligent life dense in the Galaxy; or we may be alone. It does
<br>
not matter. For the human species on this planet Earth, the quest
<br>
is part of our destiny, part of what we do as a species, and it
<br>
will go on as long as we remain civilized.
<br>
... ... J.C. Tarter and C.F. Chyba (SETI Institute, US) present a
<br>
review of current and future efforts in the search for
<br>
extraterrestrial intelligence, the authors making the following
<br>
points:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) During the past 40 years, researchers have conducted
<br>
searches for radio signals from an extraterrestrial technology,
<br>
sent spacecraft to all but one of the planets in our Solar
<br>
System, and expanded our knowledge of the conditions in which
<br>
living systems can survive. The public perception is that we have
<br>
looked extensively for signs of life elsewhere. But in reality,
<br>
we have hardly begun to search. Assuming our current,
<br>
comparatively robust space program continues, by 2050 we may
<br>
finally know whether there is, or ever was, life elsewhere in our
<br>
Solar System. At a minimum, we will have thoroughly explored the
<br>
most likely candidates, a task not yet accomplished. We will have
<br>
discovered whether life exists on Jupiter's moon Europa, or on
<br>
Mars. And we will have undertaken the systematic exobiological
<br>
exploration of planetary systems around other stars, seeking
<br>
traces of life in the spectra of planetary atmospheres. These
<br>
surveys will be complemented by expanded searches for intelligent
<br>
signals.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The authors point out that although the current language
<br>
is that of a &quot;search for extraterrestrial intelligence&quot; (SETI),
<br>
what is being sought is evidence of extraterrestrial
<br>
technologies. Until now, researchers have concentrated on only
<br>
one specific technology -- radio transmissions at wavelengths
<br>
with weak natural backgrounds and little absorption. No verified
<br>
evidence of a distant technology has been found, but the null
<br>
result may have more to do with limitations in range and
<br>
sensitivity than with actual lack of civilization. The most
<br>
distant star probed directly is still less than 1 percent of the
<br>
distance across our Galaxy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The authors conclude: &quot;If by 2050 we have found no
<br>
evidence of an extraterrestrial technology, it may be because
<br>
technical intelligence almost never evolves, or because technical
<br>
civilizations rapidly bring about their own destruction, or
<br>
because we have not yet conducted an adequate search using the
<br>
right strategy. If humankind is still here in 2050 and still
<br>
capable of doing SETI searches, it will mean that our technology
<br>
has not yet been our own undoing -- a hopeful sign for life
<br>
generally. By then we may begin considering the active
<br>
transmission of a signal for someone else to find, at which point
<br>
we will have to tackle the difficult questions of who will speak
<br>
for Earth and what they will say.&quot;
