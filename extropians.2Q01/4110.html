<p>How Did We Get So Smart? Study Sheds Light On Evolution Of The Brain 
<br>
<p>Princeton and Bell Labs scientists have devised a simple but powerful method 
<br>
for analyzing brain anatomy, providing the first reliable measure of how 
<br>
brains of humans and other mammals are related to one another across 
<br>
evolution. 
<br>
In a paper in the May 10 issue of Nature, the researchers show how comparing 
<br>
the relative sizes of 11 brain parts reveals a unique brain structure for 
<br>
each species. They calculated the percentage of total brain volume 
<br>
contributed by each part and created the term &quot;cerebrotype&quot; to describe the 
<br>
resulting 11-number characterization, just as the word &quot;genotype&quot; describes 
<br>
the unique DNA sequence for each species. 
<br>
<p>The analysis shows that mammals fall into a spectrum of cerebrotypes, with 
<br>
humans at one end and insect-eaters, such as hedgehogs, at the other. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Intuitively, we know there is something about our brains that is extreme,&quot; 
<br>
said Sam Wang, an assistant professor of molecular biology and the senior 
<br>
author of the paper. &quot;What we have here is a direct measure of one way in 
<br>
which our brains are extreme.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The findings support the &quot;social intelligence&quot; theory of primate evolution, 
<br>
which holds that prehuman ancestors were at an advantage for survival if they 
<br>
excelled at complex social dynamics such as working in groups and predicting 
<br>
the behavior of others. 
<br>
<p>Wang and colleagues based their work on a 20-year-old database assembled by 
<br>
German researchers who catalogued information about the brains of 300 
<br>
animals. Wang's co-authors on the paper are Princeton undergraduate Damon 
<br>
Clark and Partha Mitra, a scientist at Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs. 
<br>
<p>The researchers were initially interested in a comparative study of brains as 
<br>
a means of identifying general principles of brain organization. &quot;We were 
<br>
looking for underlying engineering or design principles that might account 
<br>
for how evolution led to one brain architecture and not another,&quot; said Mitra. 
<br>
<p>The research may help scientists understand the selective forces that drove 
<br>
the evolution of humans and other animals. Brain areas that showed the most 
<br>
growth over the course of evolution are likely to perform functions that 
<br>
conferred a selective advantage, said Wang. 
<br>
<p>The research confirmed, for example, previous studies showing that one brain 
<br>
area, the neocortex, grew rapidly over the course of evolution, expanding 
<br>
from 16 percent of the brain in insect-eaters to 80 percent in humans. The 
<br>
neocortex is responsible for social interactions, reasoning and other complex 
<br>
cognitive tasks, suggesting that the outcome of social interactions has been 
<br>
a powerful evolutionary force. Interestingly, even when Wang and colleagues 
<br>
eliminated the neocortex from their analysis, humans still had a unique brain 
<br>
structure, appearing on the extreme end of the chart. 
<br>
<p>In general, the researchers found that animals with the most similar 
<br>
cerebrotypes were also the most closely related by evolution. Within groups 
<br>
of related species, total brain size varied by as much as 100-fold, but the 
<br>
relative sizes of their brain parts -- their cerebrotypes -- remained 
<br>
relatively constant. Shifts in cerebrotype occurred with the emergence of new 
<br>
groups, such as the evolution of older monkeys into the great apes into 
<br>
hominids. 
<br>
<p>Another implication of the research is that the genetic mechanisms that 
<br>
control the development of the brain's structure may be much simpler than 
<br>
previously thought. Wang speculates that many differences between the brains 
<br>
of humans and those of the simplest mammals may result from evolutionary 
<br>
pressures on just a few genes. 
<br>
<p>The reason is that, as evolution progressed, the relative sizes of the 11 
<br>
brain areas shifted in only limited ways. If there were hundreds of genes 
<br>
independently controlling the sizes of the brain areas, then there would be a 
<br>
great diversity of cerebrotypes among mammals -- much more than what the 
<br>
researchers found. Instead, they were able to reduce the many variations 
<br>
between the 11 brain areas to a relatively simple, two-dimensional diagram. 
<br>
<p>Cerebrotype measurements also could lead to a better understanding of how the 
<br>
brain works by making it easier to correlate the cognitive abilities of 
<br>
various animals with their brain structures. For example, the researchers 
<br>
found that one brain region, the cerebellum, had the same approximate 
<br>
relative size in most mammals. However, whales, dolphins, and certain bats 
<br>
appeared to have larger cerebellums. They later learned that these species 
<br>
navigate by a kind of SONAR -- bouncing sound waves off their surroundings. 
<br>
The measurements suggest that the cerebellum plays a unique role in the 
<br>
complex calculations involved in that function. 
<br>
<p>Previous brain-comparison studies had focused on either the whole brain or 
<br>
did not compare brain regions directly with each other. Some, for example, 
<br>
measured the relationship of overall brain size to body size and compared 
<br>
that measure among species of different body weights. That analysis yielded 
<br>
inconclusive results, suggesting that human brains were most closely related 
<br>
to those of spider monkeys, which are not considered to be close evolutionary 
<br>
relatives. However, the researchers' new results follow widely accepted 
<br>
evolutionary charts: mammals that are closely related by evolution also 
<br>
proved to have similar cerebrotypes. 
<br>
<p>&quot;It provides a little insight into who we are and how we got here,&quot; said 
<br>
Wang.
