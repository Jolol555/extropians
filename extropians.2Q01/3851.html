<em>&gt; The Moravec Transfer, is, if I recall correctly, a comparatively early

</em><br>
<p>Implant?  Anyway, I meant a Moravec-**style** transfer, whose distinguishing
<br>
characteristic is not the robot bush or any other technical detail of
<br>
the procedure other than the fact that it avoids the **duplication**
<br>
of the conscious entity being uploaded (and secondarily, that it's
<br>
as gradual a transition as you like, that can be performed while
<br>
you're awake [*]).  The idea of uploading via duplication does nothing for me:
<br>
even though I know that there's a 50% chance that &quot;I&quot; would wake up as the
<br>
uploaded duplicate, and might feel some gratitude to the flesh-and-blood
<br>
original for making the trip possible, this flesh-and-blood original nevertheless
<br>
identifies with the other 50% likely outcome, that I would wake up to hear &quot;Well
<br>
that's all there is to it, Mr. F., you may now rest assured that there
<br>
is an accurate replica of your personality poised to take off into
<br>
the big bright beyond.  Please pay the receptionist on the way out,
<br>
and drive safely on the way home, hear?&quot;.

<em>&gt; Jim, that's like somebody asking, &quot;Show me Grand Central Station (circa
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1935)&quot; shortly after the development of the Newcommen Engine ( a pre-curson to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Watt's steam engine).
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's the point I was making.  Making a fuss over cryonic suspension
<br>
at this stage seems a little like somebody in 1710 (or whenver it was)
<br>
getting excited at the prospect of a train trip after hearing about
<br>
that early steam engine, and spending their life savings on a ticket.
<br>
I want to see the train that's going to take me to Missouri, before
<br>
I bother talking to the ticket agent.  But that's just me ;-&gt; .

<br>
<p>&quot;Yatima knelt beside Orlando.  'What do we do?  There are a lot of
<br>
people hurt, I don't know how long it will take to get help...
<br>
I still have the Introdus nanoware.  I can use it, if that's
<br>
what you want...  What do you want?  Do you want to die?'
<br>
<p>Yatima sprang to vis feet..., then fired the Introdus into
<br>
Orlando...  Ve froze.  Waves of nanoware were sweeping through
<br>
Orlando's body, shutting down nerves and sealing off blood vessels
<br>
to minimize the shock of invasion, leaving a moist pink residue
<br>
on the rubble as flesh was read and then cannibalized for energy.
<br>
Within seconds, all the waves converged to form a gray mask on
<br>
his face, which bored down to the skull and then ate through
<br>
it.  The shrinking core of nanoware spat fluid and steam, reading
<br>
and encoding crucial synaptic properties, compressing the brain
<br>
into an ever-tighter description of itself, discarding redundancies
<br>
as waste.
<br>
<p>Inoshiro stooped down and picked up the end product: a crystalline
<br>
sphere, a molecular memory containing a snapshot of everything
<br>
Orlando had been.
<br>
<p>'What now?  How many do you have left?'
<br>
<p>Yatima stared at the snapshot, dazed.  Ve had violated
<br>
Orlando's autonomy.  Like a lightning bolt, like a blast of
<br>
ultraviolet, ve had ruptured someone else's skin.
<br>
<p>'How many?'
<br>
<p>Yatima replied, 'Fourteen.'
<br>
<p>'Then we'd better go use them while we can.'&quot;

<br>
<p>My friend F sent me the following amusing reminiscence
<br>
of Vannevar Bush, science advisor to Roosevelt during
<br>
World War II:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   One time I was seeking appropriations for wartime medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   research.  With me was Dr. A. Newton Richards, the recognized dean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   of the medical fraternity....  One of the congressmen asked him,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;Doctor, will all these researches you are carrying on tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   lengthen the span of human existence?&quot;  &quot;God forbid,&quot; said Richards,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   smack into the record....  When the record came down from the Hill
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   for correction, I sent it first to Richards, and when it came back,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I found he had crossed out that question and answer.  So I restored
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   them.  I thought the passage ought to be in the permanent record of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Congress.
</em><br>
