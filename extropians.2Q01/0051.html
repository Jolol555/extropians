<p>I had a colleague from New York who was an ultraorthodox.  We had
<br>
not finished our business by Friday and he would not fly on Shabbos, so
<br>
we arranged for him to stay over.  He bought some food so as to not
<br>
buy or sell on the Sabbath but did not get back into his hotel room
<br>
before sundown.  Since the key was one of those plastic card things,
<br>
he could not open the door to his room without doing work on Shabbos
<br>
since using the electronic device would be equivalent to starting a fire.
<br>
His coworker came by a little later and found him standing in the hallway,
<br>
unwilling to break the letter of the law.
<br>
<p>Until I can find an ExI archive, I cannot suffer the expected rumbling rebuke
<br>
for that rotton Robert Robbi Reuben routine.  Such ridiculous rabid
<br>
ramblings result in really radical redundant rudeness.  spike
