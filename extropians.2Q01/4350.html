</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;technique has allowed me to eventually boil anything I have tried it on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;down to layman's terms.  This happens most often through a combination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of finding commonly-used terms that adequately describe a concept, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;finding commonly known concepts with a small and clearly describable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;set of differences from the concept being explained, and of determining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;what large sections of complexity can be reduced to a few statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;while hiding the details from the basic explanation (with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;understanding that, if those details are desired, they can be requested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;after the basics are digested).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't it a bit more complicated? The big problem with explaining something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMO is 1. what prior knowledge you assume on the part of the explainee 2.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what vocabulary is avaiable for you to explain it in simple terms (what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building blocks you have) The two clearly interact.
</em><br>
<p>True.  On the other hand, just by talking to a number of people, one
<br>
should be able to form a rough idea of the general public's knowledge
<br>
level in a given area.  It helps to customize per audience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of my worst ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences was trying to explain to an American what a &quot;googly&quot; is. Took me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an entire afternoon, much drawing of diagrams and an exposition of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire laws and basis of the game of cricket. The simple explanation &quot;It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an offbreak bowled with a legbreak action&quot; wouldn't do!
</em><br>
<p>No, because &quot;offbreak&quot; and &quot;legbreak&quot; are also unfamiliar to your
<br>
target audience, as kinda is &quot;bowled&quot; in this context, so just expand
<br>
them out.  How about &quot;a ball with spin put on it when tossed towards
<br>
the wicket behind the batsman, so that it starts off veering away from
<br>
the batsman's side of the wicket then bounces off the ground and goes
<br>
towards the batsman's side&quot;?  Here, &quot;wicket&quot; and &quot;batsman&quot; are the
<br>
generic objects that can be explained further on request; their main
<br>
relevance here is their position relative to each other and the ball.
<br>
<p>(This, BTW, is someone totally unfamiliar with cricket looking up the
<br>
terms in the first cricket dictionary Google returned:
<br>
<a href="http://home.sprynet.com/~hotoff/crickgl.htm">http://home.sprynet.com/~hotoff/crickgl.htm</a> .  I left off the &quot;with a
<br>
legbreak action&quot; because it seems intuitively that an offbreak action
<br>
and a legbreak action would be similar - just mirrors of each other -
<br>
by default, thus adding in that part of the definition adds unnecessary
<br>
complexity, unless there is some other type of action this must be
<br>
differentiated from.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That case also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reveals another problem, misleading or irrelevant knowledge on the part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the explainee - it's more difficult to explain cricket to an American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they have misleading notions derived from baseball (exactly the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in reverse by the way).
</em><br>
<p>Probably easier to model someone with no preconceptions - say, a remote
<br>
African villager who has never heard of cricket or baseball.  If you
<br>
know there is misleading or irrelevant knowledge, try to steer your
<br>
explanation away from metaphors that would invoke same...or, if the
<br>
knowledge is greatly similar (and, honestly, cricket and baseball are
<br>
much more similar than, say, cricket and elephant herding), it may be
<br>
worthwhile to explain only the differences - but *only* those
<br>
differences that are directly relevant to what you wish to explain.
<br>
(For instance, the fact that a bowler must not straighten the elbow
<br>
while bowling, or the existence and roles of any players save the
<br>
bowler and batsman, is not directly relevant to defining a 'googly'.)
<br>
Remember: adding details makes the explanation take longer, and more
<br>
importantly, makes it harder to follow, so in the first pass, only add
<br>
those details you need.  (Of course, balance this with the fact that
<br>
the details must remain available for the inquisitive, but only after
<br>
they have digested the beginning to their satisfaction.)
