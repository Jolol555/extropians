Well, you may be asking the wrong guy. Hollywood keeps telling me my 
<br>
action and high concepts are fantastic, but I need to work more on my 
<br>
characters. (Hey, what about CRICHTON??? I say.) I show 'em a 
<br>
character piece, they say they want more action. [See earlier 
<br>
Crichton quote for possible explanation. Me, I think they don't wanna 
<br>
spend $130 million to make the things.] On the other hand, New York--
<br>
said to be even more picky regarding such matters--has bought a 
<br>
novel. (Tried to get me to change the ending, too. (Hey, says I, I 
<br>
can get this kind of abuse in Hollywood--for a lot more money!))
<br>
<p>But I digress...
<br>
<p>I'll give your Q a shot. I saw the picture. Liked it more than I 
<br>
thought I would, but it's no great drama. Personally, I liked the 
<br>
&quot;You make me want to be a better man&quot; scene, and the tiny tiles when 
<br>
he opens the door. Truthfully, this is about all I remember from the 
<br>
picture. Contrast this with the fact that I recall in vivid detail 
<br>
the contents of scenes cut from The Terminator when it went to video 
<br>
16 years ago and you may indeed conclude I'm the wrong guy to ask 
<br>
about As Good As It Gets. (But, hey, I cry watching Little women, 
<br>
okay? Silent, manly tears when no one is watching, of course...) I 
<br>
think Nicholson was basically playing Nicholson, maybe a little 
<br>
nicer.
<br>
<p>SF character development? Hmmmm. Paul Atreides? (Books, not films. 
<br>
They blew the theatrical film big-time.) If you subscribe to the 
<br>
philosophy voiced in Totall Recall (based upon Dick's We Can Remember 
<br>
It For You Wholesale)--&quot;You are what you do&quot;--SF and action films 
<br>
have megatons of character development! But you must remember, the 
<br>
single genre which is expected to have the least &quot;character arc&quot; (I 
<br>
DESPISE that term!) is action--and most SF films are action. 
<br>
Typically, the hero is a tough guy who already has the training and 
<br>
the guts and just goes into a tougher-than-usual situation. Notable 
<br>
exceptions: Die Hard (somewhat, but not SF) and many of Cameron's 
<br>
films, where Ellen Ripley or Sarah Connor, e.g., both shape and are 
<br>
shaped by events--so you've got some real character development 
<br>
there, with Connor in particular. Mace in Strange Days did not follow 
<br>
this path, and of course Harry Tasker was already Mr. Superspy in 
<br>
scene one.
<br>
<p>SF is and always has been a literature of ideas.
<br>
OHMYGAWSH! THAT'S IT! 
<br>
THHAAAT'S WHY HOLLYWOOD DOESN'T UNDERSTAND SF!!!!
<br>
IT REQUIRES THAT ONE HAVE THE ABILITY TO THINK!

<em>&gt; &gt; As to characters, I thought Ian was very cool. Very very cool, okay?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ian was my favorite too, but do rent a movie that really does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a terrific job at developing *real* human characters: As Good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As It Gets.  Now, this might be out of your genre, for it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sci-fi at all, but do make an exception for this shining jewel of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a film.  Note especially the skilled character development by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the three leads, Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who form the odd trio.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider especially one scene which *defines* the actor's task of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good character development.  Hunt's character (Carol) has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bitchy to Jack's character (Udall, who richly deserved the poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment).  Udall arranges to get a doctor to heal Carol's child,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most precious thing in her life.  Jack honestly expects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *nothing* in return, he just wants Carol to do her job (a waitress).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All he wants is for her to bring his breakfast, thats all!  Carol
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pens a 30 page letter expressing her gratitude and apology, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jack hates people, hates emotion, doesnt want anything like this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note the scene in the restaurant where Carol is pouring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; herself on the floor for this wretch, and he honestly cannot handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the emotional display.  Udall loves this young woman, but he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just isnt ready for a normal human relationship.  That scene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describes life as it is, or humanity as I know it.  People are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curious bag of intellect and emotion,  interacting with each other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in strange and wonderful ways.  Both Nicholson and Hunt won
</em><br>
<em>&gt; academy awards for that performance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sci-fi has nothing really analogous to this in character
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development.  The closest I can think of is Jodie Foster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Contact, who does a fine job, but the slightly flawed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story cannot contain her soaring talent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What say ye?  spike
