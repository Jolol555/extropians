<p>
I spent some time recently browsing in the &quot;Damien Broderick
<br>
Unofficial Homepage&quot; that Barbara Lamar created to showcase
<br>
the man and his work, at <a href="http://www.thespike.addr.com/">http://www.thespike.addr.com/</a> ,
<br>
and while doing so I stumbled across the most beautiful
<br>
and moving homage to Arthur C. Clarke that I have ever seen
<br>
( <a href="http://www.thespike.addr.com/biography.htm">http://www.thespike.addr.com/biography.htm</a> , search down
<br>
the page for &quot;When it was young&quot;).
<br>
<p>Damien himself reaches heights of lyrical ecstasy
<br>
in describing the impact on his young mind of Clarke's
<br>
ode to the far future _The City and the Stars_ and
<br>
his nonfiction work of speculative futurism, _Profiles
<br>
of the Future_.  The adagio passages in these works are
<br>
melodic expressions of cosmic awe counterpointed with
<br>
the most profound obbligatos of sadness and longing
<br>
to be found in the literature of science fiction.  This
<br>
is the stuff that makes my throat ache and my eyes glisten.
<br>
<p>&quot;Our galaxy is now in the brief springtime of its life, Arthur Clarke
<br>
wrote, two-thirds of my lifetime ago, in the closing passage of _Profiles
<br>
of the Future_.  With the lyrical melancholy that marks the finest
<br>
scientific and science fiction writing, he had kept the strangest magic
<br>
until last. It is not until these stars have guttered out, he told us,
<br>
not until Vega and Sirius and the Sun have burned low, that the true
<br>
history of the universe will begin:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a history illuminated only by the reds and infrareds
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the dully-glowing stars that would be almost invisible to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our eyes; yet the sombre hues of that all-but-eternal universe
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be full of colour and beauty to whatever strange beings
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have adapted to it ...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will have time enough, in those endless aeons, to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempt all things, and to gather all knowledge. They will not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be like gods, because no gods imagined by our minds have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever possessed the powers they will command. But for all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that, they may envy us, basking in the bright afterglow of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creation; for we knew the Universe when it was young.&quot;
