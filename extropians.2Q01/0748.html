I said...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There is a critical distinction between a basement level &quot;real&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self-conscious entity and one that is running on a simulation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some sort.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Hal responded:
<br>
<em>&gt; Let me briefly give an explicit argument for why simulated beings deserve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same consideration as real ones.  Basically I will claim that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no fundamental difference between a simulated and a real being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know this is a radical claim but see if the chain of reasoning below
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is convincing.
</em><br>
<p>[snip: nice description of what I would describe as Morovecian &quot;uploading&quot; ]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The result of this chain of reasoning is that the distinction between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;levels of reality&quot; is not correct.  &quot;Simulated&quot; people are just as real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as physical ones.
</em><br>
<p>I would agree they are real in the sense that their thoughts do occur and
<br>
something has to happen in the &quot;real&quot; (basement) world for that to happen.
<br>
<p>I would also assert that they are of less *value* in a simulated world
<br>
than in the &quot;real&quot; world because they are inherently less efficient.
<br>
<em>&gt;From a resource allocation standpoint its highly inefficient to be
</em><br>
dedicating matter and energy to the simulation unless you are going
<br>
to get something out of it that justifies that expense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The thoughts are real, regardless of the context in which they appear.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, but they are not &quot;real&quot; in the sense that their existence is purposeless.
<br>
Our universe, if it is the &quot;real&quot; universe, does not exist for any reason.
<br>
It simply &quot;is&quot; (as far as I can tell).  Sim-ed universes exist for some
<br>
reason be it scientific exploration, a need for entertainment, or a desire
<br>
for company, etc.  If the creator of those universes exhausts their usefullness,
<br>
I believe they have every right to fold them up and reallocate the resources
<br>
to something else.
<br>
<p>We have &quot;moral&quot; examples of these tradeoffs in human culture.  A mother with
<br>
two infants who does not have sufficient food resources to feed both is
<br>
justified in sacrficing one to minimize the suffering it would experience
<br>
in starving and to promote the survival of the other infant.  A physician
<br>
in a war situation faced with patients who will and will not make it is
<br>
justified in dedicating his efforts to those who will.
<br>
<p>All of us, each and every day make conscious decisions to allocate our resources
<br>
for the benefit of ourselves and the benefit of those close to us.  Yet we
<br>
*know* that there are real, living, breathing, conscious people whose
<br>
realities could be greatly assisted, perhaps even preventing their deaths,
<br>
by our reallocating those resources for their use.  But we choose not to do that.
<br>
So either we are all immoral or eliminating conscious beings by commission or
<br>
omission is justifiable.
<br>
