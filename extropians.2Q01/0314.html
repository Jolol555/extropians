This is probably the best online discussion on the sense and nonsense of
<br>
religion that I have read in 5 years. I will not reply to it until I am
<br>
less busy and can do it justice. For now I am bringing it to the attention
<br>
of the Moral Divide series which does the best tv journalism on religion
<br>
that you can find. They seem to be on your wavelength. They had a program
<br>
a while back on near death experiences and the question of whether one can
<br>
scientifically verify some of the claims of religion.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If so, then they are inaccessible to the people making the claim &quot;There

<em>&gt; &gt; Baal would have understood perfectly the put-up-or-shut-up attitude of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; modern-day science.  Now this may be because Elijah is a historical

<em>&gt; &gt; character with superpowers who thus didn't lack for self-confidence, or it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may be because he's a fictional character who was invented before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defeatism that permeates modern religion.  Either way, the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; untestability and scientific inaccessibility is clearly a modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; innovation created by a bunch of theologians who, not to put too fine a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; point on it, insisted that the Earth was flat and six thousand years old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and got their butts kicked (by Truth, not Science) and have been running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scared ever since.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Frankly, you have little business claiming that you know what is and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a part of the truth so vigorously that you disown all spirituality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in one fell swoop.  One of the inaccessible truths is the creation of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working vision that unites the hopes and dreams of a people.  Religions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for good an ill are much more advanced in that work than science is. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And it strikes me, headed into Singularity, that we deeply need a vision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of where we wish to go and what kinds of beings we wish to become and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create.  You take that task very much to heart in the creation of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sysop.  Yet your model and goal of Friendliness  and the Sysop itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be subjected to falsification tests either.  Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal/vision/ethical systems rigorously testatable and falsifiable?  Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we absolutely require them in any case? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The six thousand years thing doesn't really hold water and weakens your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point. That was a calculation by one religious person in one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denomination of one religion.  Granted you can find wacky wrong headed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things in many/most/all religions.  Granted you need the power of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science to sort out what can be sorted out.  But I would hesitate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the leap from there to the notion that all that science cannot sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out (yet) is therefore false, meaningless (not even false) and of no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth at all.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religion is running scared?  Really?  Then why are the numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious holding steady and even growing?  Perhaps it is because of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit more than just human stupidity and perversity.  Perhaps the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions, even with all the blatantly wrong-headed and bad aspects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offer something that human beings strongly need/desire in their lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So now we have theologians who not only make excuses for past failures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but make up further excuses in advance.  Present them with any scenario in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which their beliefs are tested, and they'll immediately start making up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; excuses in advance for why they'll fail.  The thought that they might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; succeed doesn't even occur to them - defeatism, pure and simple.  I'm sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the excuses they're making up in advance conform exactly to the ideals of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religious faith, but whatever part of their brain is deciding which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; results they'll probably need to make excuses *for* is so perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; atheistic that not even Daniel Dannett could disapprove.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with much of this.  In my opinion an honest modern theology has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say that we don't know if God (or Powers) already exist or that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will exist (and much we do here is about their creation).  It should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about what is our possibility and what that means to us and how we be. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is more than enough in light of the approaching Singularity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hinge all of meaningful spirituality with all of its best vision, hope,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committment and joy. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We stand on the brink of being able to produce all the miracles and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acheive all of the goals that most religions talk about.  We approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the gate leading to the Transcendence of all that we are.  This is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place for passive waiting but for walking forward with a song in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hearts and a growing vision and confidence in what it is that we wish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acheieve.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your Sysop is a Power (at least the beginnings of one), as powerful as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many notions of God.  It is created to protect us from our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destructiveness and to end all suffering of humanity.  It has very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly similar tones to much religion/spirituality. Not all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spirituality or all religions are the simple-minded excesses and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistakes habitually brought up on this list to be jeered at.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Modern theology has suffered a total failure of confidence.  The Books
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; demonstrate very clearly that religions are supposed to be testable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Humans innately expect people with religious power to predict the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and heal the sick.  Modern theologians can't heal diddly, which was fine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; back when nobody else could either, but now that technology has come along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they're scared sick that somebody's going to notice the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; making big claims and delivering on them.  But that is simply not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; science's problem.  It gets solved either when another prophet comes along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who can actually heal the sick, or when religion finally folds in and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; admits it was a lie all along.  Either way, theology's failure to live up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to its own expectations has nothing to do with science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religion is not a lie so much as the hope for that which is not yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen.  Now we are in the process of creating and thus seeing it.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not the end of religion but the fruition of all the deep human dreams
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and yearning embedded in it.  The theologians, if they had their wits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about them, would not be trembling in fear but rushing to embrace the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magnificent and utterly awesome bounty opening to humanity.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, Eliezer, if we don't have &quot;immortal souls&quot; we will quite soon have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full backups of our complete mental/personality patterns redundantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stored in your beloved Sysop and elsewhere.  That will do quite nicely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in their place.  If your Sysop or science yet invented can do this and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can furthermore transfer this &quot;essence&quot; from body to body to computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so on, then why exactly are you so hot to put down the idea of souls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per se?  Whether it is a notion from a &quot;golden age&quot; where what we now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see as possible was real, or a &quot;mere&quot; wish for what is not, or a vision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what will/could be, the idea of an essence free from this particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flesh is not ridiculous at all.  It is closer to being an everyday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality now than it has ever been.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If your Sysop and other Powers can exist then exactly how the heck do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you know for an absolute fact that such beings and ones beyond even your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vision and imagining don't already exist?  How do you know that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not already backed up or in a VR or training program or are simply part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the timeline of the becoming of a Power that will/has loop[ed] back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on its own timeline?  Because you see no evidence?  If such a reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was the truth then you would not see any such evidence by necessity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or design.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If God is not then God will be.  If God will be then God is. Time is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion, especially in the presence of God.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Draw a line in the sand, theologians!  Pick a place where you stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; retreating!  Put up or shut up!  Say that the upload will die on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spot.  Say that he'll turn into a remorseless killer.  Say that he'll lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all his artistic creativity.  Say that we'll find the neurons are doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something incomprehensible.  Say that no amount of experimentation will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ever explain it enough to correctly predict a single neuron.  I can plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the possibility of a religious universe if you'll tell me how it looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different from a totally materialist universe, but as long as you go on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; using rabidly atheistic Outcome Predictors, then I'm sorry, but there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nothing I can do for you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having fun ranting?  :-)  This neo-thelogian does not have to put up or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shut up.  You are in the process of creating the reality that all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fingers pointing at the moon point to.  I am content that you get on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A materialist universe looks exactly like a religious universe once you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have continuously self-augmenting Powers running about.  Especially if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are able to manipulate space-time directly.  It is not the simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minded relgious universe that the religions have largely de-generated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into.  But it is not simple materialism either.
