The question had to do with how a particular group of people will respond
<br>
to the types of techonologies we want, as extropians. Yes, this is the
<br>
extropy list, and the question had specifically to do with how a particular
<br>
group would respond to us. This, I think, is perfectly on topic. Of course
<br>
there are few 'true believers', but pissing off the nominal members by
<br>
insulting their entire group's beliefs seems counterproductive.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the United States bans cloning, and an Islamic country doesn't,
<br>
ought we to say &quot;No thanks, we don't agree with you, so we're just not
<br>
going to pursue our research.&quot;, do you think? You've added nothing to this
<br>
thread, and have drawn me into a pointless debate over something which is
<br>
a) untrue overall and b) not at all related to the subject, just so you can
<br>
spout bigoted nonsense. I was very seriously trying to talk about something
<br>
important. I'm done talking about this, I've got more important things to
<br>
do with my time.

Subject: Re: Islam, theology and politeness

<p>From: &lt;<a href="mailto:michael.bast@convergys.com?Subject=Re:%20extropians-digest%20V6%20#65&In-Reply-To=&lt;OF07A18143.087C6DFC-ON85256A08.004F8E96@cbis.com&gt;">michael.bast@convergys.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;      There was a question about how Islam (about 25% of the planet's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population) would respond to the types of technology we are interested
</em><br>
in.
<br>
<p>If it's important to consider how Muslims respond to extropic technology,
<br>
then it's three times MORE important to question how non-Muslims (about
<br>
75% of the planet's population) would respond to extropic technology,
<br>
because there are three times more of them. Since this is the Extropy list
<br>
(not the Muslim theology list), it seems somewhat OT to discuss Islamic
<br>
responses and/or theology. But since no one has complained...
<br>
<p>Muslims, just like Jews, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, and any other
<br>
faith-based creeds, have a small percentage of true believers, and the
<br>
rest are content to identify themselves with their parents' denomination
<br>
and go about their business, not giving it much thought. As Max's recent
<br>
presentation at a Jewish school shows, normal, healthy kids don't let
<br>
religious memes interfere with their perception of reality at large. I
<br>
imagine that most of these kids are smart enough to ask questions like the
<br>
following.
