<p>I could have explained this idea a little better.  The nodes
<br>
are still arranged in rings, concentric but not coplanar,
<br>
forming an effective shell, Bradbury style.  But I realized
<br>
the connecting wires need not be a factor of 5 longer
<br>
than the distance between the nodes.
<br>
<p>Think of the Keplerian law that requires equal areas
<br>
to be swept out in equal time.  Now imagine a ring of
<br>
nodes in a circular orbit around the sun at 1 AU
<br>
where each node is one second apart,  ~ 30 million
<br>
nodes at 5 km separated.  Now imagine the same number
<br>
of nodes in an elliptical orbit with a perihelion at about
<br>
0.7 AU and aphelion at about twice that, 1.4 AU.  For
<br>
the nodes to stay 1 second apart (which they would,
<br>
without external influence) then the nodes at perihelion
<br>
would be at twice the distance as the ones out at
<br>
aphelion, eh?
<br>
<p>You can never get a perfectly exactly circular orbit;
<br>
the distance between the nodes will always
<br>
vary slightly over the orbit.  If they are not allowed
<br>
to vary slightly {as if you had a solid ring} then the
<br>
orbit is unstable.  Solution, connect the individual
<br>
nodes with a very slack cable and use that wispy cable
<br>
as a communications waveguide.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, I realized there is no need to have a
<br>
cable 5 times as long as the distance between
<br>
nodes, thats waaaay overkill, and unadvisable for
<br>
it wastes raw material.  If the ratio of
<br>
perihelion to aphelion is 1.02, then a the distance
<br>
between the nodes will only vary by about 2 percent,
<br>
by the previous argument.  So having a cable 20
<br>
percent longer than the node spacing should be
<br>
aaaample slack, providing a quick low-power
<br>
communication waveguide without destabilizing
<br>
the orbit.
<br>
<p>What say ye, Sir Robert?  spike
