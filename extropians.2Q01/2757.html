Baby lampreys, now. would you gladly give up the puppy for an 
<br>
experiment which will first place its brain in a vat and then kill it 
<br>
within days? Should animals be brought into the world for this 
<br>
purpose?
<br>
<p>I had a dog which got to the point where it couldn't lay down because 
<br>
the fluid in its lungs would drown it. Have to disagree about this 
<br>
experimental form of death being not much worse than a natural (or 
<br>
injection-) death. If that brain is still conscious, it will be 
<br>
terrified the last moments/hours/days of its life--abandoned and 
<br>
utterly alone, with no comforting sensory &quot;input.&quot; You would be the 
<br>
cause of that, and your pet would know it.
<br>
<p>Reconsider.

&gt; &gt; The acts themselves are, pardon me, evil. No question.
&gt; &gt; What you have here is ends-justify-the-means rationale. Any pet
&gt; &gt; owners here? What would you think of the same being done to Fido or
&gt; &gt; Princess?
&gt; 
&gt; Having lost a cat of my own recently, under circumstances in which
&gt; experiments like this might have resulted in her still being alive, I
&gt; would have jumped at the opportunity to use her as a test subject for
&gt; this.  One could tell she was starting to hate life anyway as her
&gt; insides slowly gave out, so her dying this way would not have been much
&gt; worse than her dying naturally, for her or myself.  (It's a bit too
&gt; late to make that choice now, though.)
&gt; 
&gt; But I may be an exception.  More to the point, though, this typically
&gt; is not done to Fido or Princess, but to lab animals specifically bred
&gt; for these experiments.  Consider mice: they can be as warm and cuddly
&gt; as any mammal their size, and are sometimes used as pets, yet they are
&gt; also the main food-devouring, disease-carrying (either in their blood
&gt; or in riders in their fur), house-damaging scourge in many areas and
&gt; eras of human history (case in point: the Black Plague).  So...should
&gt; one shed a tear for cyber-mice experiments?
