OK, I had never thought that there was any reason to
<br>
believe that there was anything wrong with a
<br>
fluoridated drinking supply.  But, I have a habit of
<br>
exploring viewpoints that I disagree with, so I
<br>
thought I'd see if these anti-fluoridation people were
<br>
all complete flakes, or simply deluded, or what.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I now have serious doubts about
<br>
fluoridation.  After dispensing with the obvious
<br>
flakes, like the &quot;Fluoride is government mind control&quot;
<br>
people, I found some things that were actually useful:
<br>
<p>WHY I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT WATER FLUORIDATION:
<br>
<a href="http://www.fluoridation.com/colquhoun.htm">http://www.fluoridation.com/colquhoun.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The above is about a guy who was the Principal Dental
<br>
Officer of Auckland, New Zealand who, while doing
<br>
research to become New Zealand's expert on
<br>
fluoridation to lead a campaign to promote
<br>
fluoridation, came to change his mind completely.
<br>
<p>An overview with many references:

<p>WHY EPA'S HEADQUARTERS UNION OF SCIENTISTS OPPOSES
<br>
FLUORIDATION:

<br>
<p>Fluoridation also appears to be banned in most of
<br>
Western Europe:

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure there are people here that know much
<br>
more about this stuff than I do, so...  Comments
<br>
please?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose this doesn't really relate to
<br>
transhumanism very well, but what the hell...  :-)
