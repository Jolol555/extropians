FW: THE LIGHTHOUSE: April 3, 2001from THE LIGHTHOUSE VOL. 3, ISSUE 13 April

<br>
<p>THE FED'S Y2K RECESSION OF 2001
<br>
<p>Investors puzzled by the recent stock-market fall and economic slowdown
<br>
should cast their eyes at the Federal Reserve's bungled Y2K policies.
<br>
According to Paul Craig Roberts, former undersecretary of the U.S. Treasury
<br>
and research fellow at The Independent Institute, current economic
<br>
turbulence can be traced directly to the Fed's response to anticipated
<br>
public fears of the so-called millennium bug.
<br>
<p>&quot;The Federal Reserve, thinking that Americans would withdraw a tremendous
<br>
amount of cash to protect themselves against computer crashes, added excess
<br>
liquidity during 1999,&quot; Roberts writes in a recent syndicated column. &quot;But
<br>
Americans did not hoard cash. Consequently, the liquidity found its way into
<br>
stock prices.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;With the smooth transition to the year 2000,&quot; Roberts continues, &quot;the Fed
<br>
realized that it had made a policy mistake by pumping up the monetary base
<br>
to inflationary levels. Reacting to its own prior miscalculation, the Fed
<br>
withdrew the excess liquidity. The result was higher interest rates and
<br>
lower stock prices.&quot;
<br>
Will this cause a recession in 2001? Roberts thinks so.
<br>
<p>In addition to the economic hardships caused by the Fed's monetary mischief,
<br>
Americans have had to suffer from bad policies passed in the aftermath of
<br>
Fed-caused recessions, and their fallout, says Roberts. The Great Depression
<br>
was triggered by the Fed allowing the money supply to collapse by one-third.
<br>
The ensuing big-government programs of the New Deal &quot;slowly altered the
<br>
American character, accustoming people to trade off freedom for security,
<br>
much like free men after the fall of Rome became serfs in exchange for
<br>
military protection,&quot; writes Roberts.
<br>
<p>All the more reason, then, for Americans who care deeply about freedom and
<br>
self-responsibility to think seriously about alternatives to the Federal
<br>
Reserve Bank.
