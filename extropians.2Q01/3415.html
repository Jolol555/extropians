Anders Sandberg continues near-term stuff,
<br>
<em>&gt; Actually, the only defense that can ever work is a defense that works even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the enemy knows how it works. Security through obscurity is not safe.
</em><br>
Do
<br>
<em>&gt; you really think that it would be possible or desirable to keep the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functioning of an organisation that would likely involve thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different groups secret?
</em><br>
<p>Ah, so! In that case, whoever manages to get the most and best cooperation and
<br>
collaborative security wins. So, who's most popular, the inscrutible Chinese
<br>
or the decadent Americans. No contest. Nothing to worry about. End of story.
<br>
Thanks for solving that one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I thought you wanted to *avoid* abusive states? :-)
</em><br>
<p>Right, and there are more abusive states around here (Arizona, Oregon, Nevada,
<br>
etc.). You only have to deal with one abusive city-state (which China probably
<br>
won't try to annex). ô¿ô
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is a bit of wishful thinking: if we create something complex enough it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will become intelligent. There is not a shred of evidence for that
</em><br>
happening,
<br>
<em>&gt; since intelligent thought requires a rather sophisticated and deliberate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organisation, so it is unlikely to occur by chance. On the other hand, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spike alluded, the effect of billions of people writing, linking and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modifying the Net does introduce an element of intelligence. So my answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be that we should look more for something like the global intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the EarthWeb in Marc Stiegler's novel rather than a god awakening to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sound of all phones ringing.
</em><br>
<p>OK, that puts a Global Brain beyond near-term stuff (except for fantasies
<br>
about &quot;Gaia&quot;).
<br>
<p>My most pressing near-term extropian issue is to find out why Bill Joy, and a
<br>
few of his pals, who seem like such intelligent and practical folks, have gone
<br>
off the deep end with a self-contradictory position of trying to stay in
<br>
control by &quot;relinquishing&quot; experimentation. How can they think that makes
<br>
sense? Are they frightened out of their wits?
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
