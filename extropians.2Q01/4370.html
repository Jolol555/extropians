<p>&quot;Professor Goddard does not know the relation between action and

reaction and the need to have something better than a vacuum against

which to react. He seems to lack the basic knowledge ladled out daily

&quot;Space travel is utter bilge!&quot; -Sir Richard Van Der Riet Wolley,

&quot;Space travel is bunk&quot; -Sir Harold Spencer Jones, Astronomer Royal of

<p>&quot;There is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever

be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered

&quot;The more important fundamental laws and facts of physical science

&nbsp;have all been discovered, and these are now so firmly established

that the possibility of their ever being supplanted in consequence of
