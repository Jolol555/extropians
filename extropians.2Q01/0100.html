I pass on the following exchange from a list of close friends.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Mr Burch is fond of blaming Hollywood, mainstream media, education, and
<br>
other social reflectors for how badly science is being treated these
<br>
days. Author Colin Tudge suggests--in a spirit of friendliness--that the
<br>
fault may lie with scientists themselves, and in particular, those who
<br>
have striven most hard to be it's advocates. 
<br>
<p>--M.D.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I love science. It is what I have always done. I remember the warmth I
<br>
nursed for weeks when, aged 13, I qualified for form Science 3A, already
<br>
specialising at that tender age. I can still get the same thrill from
<br>
some books and laboratories, when ideas are neat and properly decorated.
<br>
<p>Science is not an innately arrogant pursuit. Newton said that science
<br>
was for the glory of God - the God-given intellect dedicated to the
<br>
glorification of God's works. We need not embrace the theological
<br>
language of the 17th century, but the sentiment is precisely right. It
<br>
is shared by many a modern scientist: that the true purpose of science
<br>
is not to change the universe or to make it more comfortable, but to
<br>
appreciate it more fully. Science has risen gloriously to the challenge:
<br>
the universe that is now revealed, and the creatures within it, are
<br>
infinitely more various and intricate than human beings ever conceived
<br>
of without the help of science, and best of all is the realisation that
<br>
so much is still to be done.
<br>
<p>Science, in short, should be heart-warming, encapsulating precisely that
<br>
love of scholarship for its own sake (or, as Newton and many a rabbi and
<br>
mullah would say, for God's sake) which runs through all civilisation.
<br>
<p>Other people don't see it like this. Science has a macho, gung-ho image.
<br>
Understanding is not for its own sake, but is presented as the means to
<br>
&quot;conquest&quot; - of the stars, of disease, of whatever. It comes across as a
<br>
nuts-and-bolts pursuit: regrettably necessary, but posing various
<br>
threats to the human spirit through its intemperate attacks on
<br>
traditional beliefs and through its ruthless rationality. We are still
<br>
locked in the battle of Dionysus v Apollo, with Apollo now cast as a
<br>
blend of nerd and Strangelove. Schoolchildren turn away from science,
<br>
and teachers must be bribed to take it up. For all this, scientists
<br>
blame the media for their hype and general mischief (although the
<br>
science correspondents are excellent); &quot;the public&quot; for its fecklessness
<br>
and &quot;ignorance&quot;; and the subject itself, because it is too difficult and
<br>
can properly be understood only by the officially initiated subsection
<br>
of the intelligentsia.
<br>
<p>What I want to suggest - in a spirit of friendliness - is that most of
<br>
the fault lies with the scientists themselves and, in particular, with
<br>
those who have striven most hard to be its advocates. Too often, they
<br>
make it seem arrogant, macho, threatening, pompous but, in the end,
<br>
naive: all those qualities that non-scientists say they find most repellent.
<br>
Attempts to lighten it up frequently come across as clownishness - a
<br>
dangerous quality to link to such obvious power. To some extent, this is
<br>
just bad PR: there is no need for scientists to attack Christianity or
<br>
Islam, for example. But the flaw runs deeper. It cannot be put right
<br>
with a course in media training. The startling truth is that some of the
<br>
most conspicuous spokespeople for science horribly misrepresent it: what
<br>
it is, what it is like, what it can helpfully comment upon, and where it
<br>
should be silent. They have, in fact, misconstrued the nature of their
<br>
own craft.
<br>
<p>What science is was beautifully summarised by the philosopher Karl
<br>
Popper. An idea can belong to science, he said, only if it is testable.
<br>
Science is thus composed of testable hypotheses. He went on to say that
<br>
hypotheses can, in principle, be shown to be false, but cannot be shown
<br>
unequivocally to be true: so &quot;testable hypothesis&quot; became &quot;falsifiable
<br>
hypothesis&quot;. Various philosophers have taken him to task for this -
<br>
pointing out that it can be just as hard to falsify as to verify. But
<br>
&quot;testability&quot; wins through.
<br>
<p>This idea is simple but far-reaching. It suggests immediately that
<br>
science is not anchored, as many perceive it to be, in subject matter:
<br>
it is not just the sum of chemistry, physics and biology. Rather, it is
<br>
a method, an approach, that can include the psychology and behaviour of
<br>
human beings or the policies of a government. Everything is within the
<br>
compass of science, provided it is testable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Popper's notions, too, science emerges as an innately humble
</em><br>
pursuit. Science is not an edifice of truth, built stone by stone. It is
<br>
a landscape painting, never finished: each addition, each fresh handcart
<br>
and bathing goddess, changes the balance of the whole, sometimes beyond
<br>
rescue so the whole must be started again. Science's perceived arrogance
<br>
is doubly unfortunate: it drives people away and it misrepresents the
<br>
subject. Even if we reject Popper's strict principle of falsifiability,
<br>
we see that the &quot;truths&quot; of science, its theories, must always be both
<br>
partial and provisional. Every idea, no matter how satisfying and
<br>
complete it seems, is waiting to be knocked off its perch, or at least
<br>
improved upon. We can be certain at any one time only that there is more
<br>
to know. All suggestions in the past that such-and-such a subject has
<br>
been sewn up were invariably followed by the rudest of shocks.
<br>
Michelson measured the speed of light in the late 19th century and
<br>
declared that physics was over but for the dotting of i's; in a decade
<br>
or two came Einstein and then Planck, leading on to quantum mechanics,
<br>
and then the whole universe was up for grabs, as it still is.
<br>
<p>At any one time, it is logically impossible to know how much is not
<br>
known - whether science has already lit up the universe like a football
<br>
stadium, or merely laid a trail or two across the darkness.
<br>
Non-scientists who fear that God's mystery has been forever compromised
<br>
need have no fears; in the end, there is always mystery. Those who
<br>
suggest that it is blasphemous to probe God's intentions are themselves
<br>
guilty of blasphemy. God is not a conjuror, whose tricks seem tawdry
<br>
when exposed. The more you see, the more wondrous it all becomes.
<br>
<p>In short, as Newton and most of his contemporaries saw (including
<br>
Galileo, who was a good Catholic), it is remarkably simple to reconcile
<br>
excellent science with religion. Professor Richard Dawkins has made this
<br>
very point: &quot;If it is religious to perceive the universe with awe,&quot; he
<br>
has said (although I paraphrase), &quot;then I am religious.&quot; Much of the
<br>
essence of religion is to experience first the awe, and then the sense
<br>
of reverence that should follow from it. Science inspires in just this way.
<br>
<p>Why, then, does science allow itself to be seen as the natural enemy of
<br>
religion, and thus antagonise so many people for no good reason at all?
<br>
Yes, there are some serious conflicts. The clash between Darwin and
<br>
Genesis, for example, lies not in the details of geology, for Genesis
<br>
can be seen as a good first draft, made in the virtual absence of data
<br>
(or any inkling of &quot;testable hypothesis&quot;). The clash is as Daniel
<br>
Dennett describes it in his book Darwin's Dangerous Idea. Orthodox
<br>
Christians of the 19th century argued, as John Locke had done in the
<br>
17th, that intelligent beings could not be made except by an even more
<br>
intelligent Creator already in place; but natural selection shows how,
<br>
in principle, life and then intelligence can emerge from simple
<br>
beginnings, with no overseer at all. But religion as a whole does not
<br>
rest on that one piece of theology; and in general, given that religion
<br>
is innately untestable, it remains outside the purlieus of science.
<br>
There can be spats, but there is no mortal conflict in which to engage.
<br>
<p>Why, then, has Dawkins, outstanding thinker and writer that he is within
<br>
his own field, gone to such lengths to brandish his atheism, and so
<br>
derisorily? His attacks have not been worthy of either his own
<br>
scholarship or his victims.
<br>
<p>And why was Professor Lewis Wolpert so keen to emphasise the differences
<br>
between religion and science in this year's Michael Faraday lecture
<br>
(which might have made Faraday himself, a serious Christian, turn in his
<br>
Sandemanian plot in Highgate Cemetery)? Wolpert is a Fellow of the Royal
<br>
Society, former chairman of its Committee for the Public Understanding
<br>
of Science, a prodigal broadcaster, and thus widely perceived as an
<br>
official spokes- person. In prestigious lectures, what he says matters.
<br>
And he told his audience that, whereas we have an evolved propensity for
<br>
religion, with an innate tendency to believe in God, the scientific way
<br>
of thinking is &quot;unnatural&quot;, the antithesis of common sense. He has
<br>
written a book on this: The Unnatural Nature of Science.
<br>
<p>That human beings do have an evolved predilection for religion seems
<br>
entirely plausible, and for the reasons Wolpert presented. We need to
<br>
make sense of our environment, and &quot;sense&quot; in this context implies a
<br>
feeling for cause and effect. Many religions are rooted in the entirely
<br>
forgivable idea that nothing happens unless somebody makes it happen,
<br>
and on the grand scale this &quot;somebody&quot; must be God. Furthermore, Wolpert
<br>
might have added, societies cohere better if everyone subscribes
<br>
publicly to a common belief, whatever that belief may be. Each needs to
<br>
know what the others think, or they cannot trust each other.
<br>
<p>Yet on Radio 4 a few days earlier, Wolpert spoke of religion as a
<br>
&quot;delusion&quot;. We are led to infer that belief in religion in general and
<br>
God in particular is delusory because it is an evolved survival
<br>
strategy. This &quot;because&quot; is a resounding non sequitur. What we are or
<br>
are not evolved to believe in tells us nothing whatever about its
<br>
reality. We are evolved to perceive light, but we do not conclude that
<br>
light is delusory. Some theologians, quite independently of any
<br>
Darwinian gloss, have argued that God must exist because otherwise we
<br>
would not believe in Him. That argument is obviously fatuous, but so is
<br>
its Wolpert-style antithesis.
<br>
<p>Is science really unnatural? One can see that even Galileo's idea that
<br>
light objects fall just as quickly as heavy ones has a counter-intuitive
<br>
quality, and quantum mechanics is off the scale of everyday conception.
<br>
But the basic method of science as identified by Popper - make a guess
<br>
and then test it - is the essence of all thinking. You do it, I do it,
<br>
cats do it, even worms do it. For day-to-day purposes, there is no other
<br>
way to get a feel for whatever is going on. Seen in this light, science
<br>
emerges as the most natural process of all. The unnaturalness (if such
<br>
it is) of science lies only in its explicitness: that it lays out
<br>
problems for inspection, while our own commonsensical brains, bent on
<br>
survival, draw lightning conclusions from fleeting impressions and are
<br>
content with imperfection, provided it works.
<br>
<p>Wolpert is also prone (and is far from alone in this) to emphasise the
<br>
difficulty of science, and to conclude from this that it is best left to
<br>
experts like, er, himself. At best, this view discourages, which is not
<br>
a good thing for a teacher to do. At worst, it repels. It is an affront
<br>
to democracy and, worse, to human dignity.
<br>
<p>Science can indeed be very hard - but for many different reasons, and it
<br>
is important to distinguish them. It is hard because there is so much of
<br>
it, and different bits depend on other bits, so it takes a long time to
<br>
get into. But then, the same is true of any subject, from music to
<br>
Spanish conversation. It is esoteric - meaning you have to know the
<br>
background before you can get to grips with the matter in hand. Again,
<br>
this is true of everything. Much of science, such as immunology, is
<br>
complicated. But so is gardening - yet it is not innately difficult.
<br>
Some science, such as quantum mechanics, is truly counter-intuitive. But
<br>
scientists, too, have difficulty with this: as Niels Bohr said, if you
<br>
think it is easy, you haven't understood the problem. Or as a professor
<br>
of physics once told me when I asked him how he pictured a
<br>
nine-dimensional universe: &quot;You don't. You just do the maths.&quot; Maths is
<br>
always a problem, because the human brain is not geared to it. We are
<br>
nature's wordsmiths. But some spectacularly good scientists have also
<br>
been spectacularly bad mathematicians. Darwin regretted his own
<br>
innumeracy. Faraday, a visionary physicist, pleaded forlornly for &quot;plain
<br>
words&quot;. There are very few Newtons around, able to invent a new form of
<br>
maths (calculus, in his case) when the traditional kinds prove inadequate.
<br>
<p>In short, scientists also have trouble with the problems in science that
<br>
are really hard. Most of them, like most of us, see only as far as the
<br>
geniuses allow them to see. Indeed, take away the top 20 geniuses from
<br>
the past 400 years and we would still be living in the 17th century,
<br>
with the clever but stilted physics of Robert Boyle and John Ray's
<br>
natural history. On the other hand, once the big ideas are explained,
<br>
then some of them at least - including those of biology, which impact
<br>
most directly on our lives - are actually rather easy. Natural selection
<br>
can be explained in five minutes (although it has taken 140 years so far
<br>
to work through the connotations), and Mendel's experiments with peas,
<br>
the basis of all subsequent genetics, seem so simple that we may wonder
<br>
what the fuss was about. In fact, Mendel's was the simplicity of genius.
<br>
But we lesser mortals can wallow in his vision, just as we do in Mozart
<br>
and Picasso. We don't have to belong to a special club to take part.
<br>
Wolpert's insistence on the difficulty looks very like an attempt to
<br>
protect the high priesthood. But those who build walls invite graffiti.
<br>
<p>Scientists must loosen up. It is false, for example, to suggest, as they
<br>
sometimes have, that people who do not practise science have no right to
<br>
comment at all, and get it wrong when they do. The corollary, that
<br>
scientists can be relied upon to get it right, is equally false. To be
<br>
sure, there would be no science at all without scientists; but that does
<br>
not mean that science belongs to them, any more than art belongs to
<br>
artists, or politics to politicians. Science's greatest quality is that
<br>
it does not rely upon authority, at least in principle. Its ideas are
<br>
explicit, laid out for universal scrutiny. Only religion is arcane, and
<br>
can make a virtue of this.
<br>
To insist on the specialness of scientists, and to appeal to their
<br>
authority, is to adopt the methods of religion at its most pristine,
<br>
where all ideas must be filtered through the chosen few. If everyone
<br>
comments on science, then many silly things will be said. But that is
<br>
what it means for a subject truly to be part of culture.
<br>
<p>When they are drawn into public debate, scientists, like all of us,
<br>
should tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Their
<br>
presentations throughout the debates on BSE and GMOs have, on the whole,
<br>
been woeful. We have been treated again and again to the stock phrase:
<br>
&quot;There is no evidence that . . .&quot; I have never heard anyone add: &quot;But
<br>
absence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence.&quot; Without that
<br>
codicil, we do not have the whole truth. I did not here even one
<br>
scientist explain in a public place why they took exception to the claim
<br>
by the Aberdeen-based biologist Dr Arpad Pusztai that genetically
<br>
modified potatoes had strange effects on rats. They had plenty of
<br>
airtime, but they used it to complain that Pusztai had spoken to the
<br>
press before apprising his peers. This was a fair complaint. But what
<br>
really matters? People's well-being and enlightenment, or the dignity of
<br>
scientists? When scientists ask me how to talk to the public, I ask
<br>
them: &quot;Have you ever tried behaving like a human being? Would you palm
<br>
your Granny off with an unqualified, 'There is no evidence that . . .'?&quot;
<br>
It is not media-training that is needed, but a sense of citizenship.
<br>
<p>Science needs a new image. Its Apollonic rationality is wonderful at its
<br>
best, clear and pure. Beware, though, what has lately been called &quot;the
<br>
rationalistic fallacy&quot;. That it is rational does not make it right, or
<br>
good, or necessarily better than some impassioned, if badly articulated,
<br>
instinct. Besides, science has a romantic face, too. It is methodical,
<br>
but it does not simply grind to its conclusions. Creativity matters at
<br>
least as much as in the arts: huge leaps of imagination that come from
<br>
nowhere. British students of English learn about Blake's antipathy to
<br>
science and Thomas Gradgrind's obsession with &quot;facts&quot; (&quot;A horse, Sir: a
<br>
graminivorous quadruped&quot;), but many English artists were inspired by
<br>
science and technology: Turner, Ruskin, George Eliot, Gerard Manley
<br>
Hopkins. Early 19th-century Germany gave us the buttoned-down end of
<br>
modern biology, from cell theory through genetics (Mendel was
<br>
German-speaking) to biochemistry. For much of that time, however, it was
<br>
steeped in the literally &quot;romantic&quot; notions of Naturphilosophie and of
<br>
vitalism, and in its turn the science inspired German Romanticism. All
<br>
this seems to get written out of the act.
<br>
<p>All in all, we need much more than committees and professors for the
<br>
public understanding of science, lectures de haute en bas. We need a
<br>
different kind of science education. Science should not be taught simply
<br>
as an apprenticeship - which, more often than not, remains the case -
<br>
but as a significant slice of cultural history and a way of looking at
<br>
the world.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   &lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Thanks, Michael for passing that on.  It is a very well written and, on its 
<br>
own terms, correct criticism of some of the sentiments I often express.  
<br>
Tudge -- in his friendly way -- makes folks like Dawkins and me seem like 
<br>
churlish spoilers.  His essay comes at a time when the &quot;Dawkinsians&quot; are 
<br>
reacting to Stephen Jay Gould's new thesis about the &quot;separate magisteria&quot; of 
<br>
science and religion, Gould's way of asking &quot;Can't we all just get along?&quot;  
<br>
And there are certainly truly religious people with whom I CAN get along.  
<br>
One of my partners and good friends is a devout Episcopalian, with whom I 
<br>
have had many hours of good conversation about history and philosophy over 
<br>
the years.  Our friend Scott in this group is a religious person who has 
<br>
earned my respect and admiration.  I have disagreements with them, but no 
<br>
&quot;quarrel&quot; - at least not one that is acrimonious and that can't be worked out 
<br>
in a civil way that can lead to a peaceful and even prosperous coexistence.
<br>
<p>There are, however, a great many people with whom I DO have a quarrel that I 
<br>
can only express in &quot;unfriendly&quot; terms - because those people express their 
<br>
religion in a way that is fundamentally unfriendly to me and the values and 
<br>
goals I hold dear.  And yes, as your introduction indicates, I believe those 
<br>
people have seized a &quot;commanding height&quot; in our popular culture in a way that 
<br>
I find to be deeply threatening to values that seem to be shared by me AND 
<br>
those religious people toward whom I feel friendship.  
<br>
<p>I don't need to belabor in this group the outlines of this threat: There is a 
<br>
rising tide of irrationality that threatens the foundations of the basic 
<br>
agreement upon which our society was founded that the civic arena would be a 
<br>
secular one.  I have said before that I believe much of the fault lies with 
<br>
the leaders of the scientific enterprise in earlier times.  During the first 
<br>
half of the 20th century, those who were continuing the program of the 
<br>
Enlightenment allowed themselves to be fooled into thinking that their 
<br>
philosophical values were more widely understood and held than in fact they 
<br>
were.  They neglected the necessary task of translating their work at the 
<br>
frontiers of knowledge into terms that were accessible to the majority of 
<br>
people who had not traveled so far down the path of reason.  As a result, the 
<br>
thicket of superstition reclaimed much of what had been thought to be ground 
<br>
cleared for the light.
<br>
<p>The outlines of the relationship between science and religion have changed 
<br>
since the days when Huxley debated the Archbishop of Canterbury.  For one 
<br>
thing, Tudge's assertions to the contrary, the scientific enterprise HAS 
<br>
moved into areas that could in an earlier time be safely relegated to a 
<br>
&quot;demilitarized zone&quot; in the conflict between faith and the scientific method. 
<br>
&nbsp;We have now explored and are poised to colonize regions that religious 
<br>
people could comfortably feel were immune to the inquiry of science and 
<br>
manipulation by technology, i.e. the fundamental nature of humanity and the 
<br>
basic fabric of reality and our perception of it.  The old diplomacy between 
<br>
Gould's &quot;separate magisteria&quot; won't hold up in these changed circumstances.
<br>
<p>Beyond this, the syncretism that has resulted from increased communication 
<br>
between cultures and the postmodernist dogma of cultural relativism has 
<br>
opened the floodgates to a tide of new strains of irrationality.  At the very 
<br>
same time that science begins to comprehend the basic nature of humanity and 
<br>
reality, popular culture is assaulted by the purveyors of crystal power, 
<br>
alien abduction stories and every form of ju-ju in between.  In the midst of 
<br>
this flood, many holding the trappings of cultural authority in our society 
<br>
tell us that we lack the means to discriminate between the &quot;narratives&quot; of 
<br>
the physicist and the psychic hotline.  Science has progressed to the point 
<br>
that we stand on the threshold of taking power over our own evolution in ways 
<br>
that are fundamentally more potent than anything we have ever possessed as a 
<br>
species before, while at the same time the most compelling voices in our 
<br>
culture -- the seductive images offered by the mass media -- proffer a basic 
<br>
message that human life is just as likely to be influenced by demons and 
<br>
angels as any force that might be subject to rational understanding.
<br>
<p>Finally, in terms of numbers, the contest between science and superstition is 
<br>
utterly unequal.  The largest number of our species do not have the slightest 
<br>
inkling that there may be a means to guide human life other than by the 
<br>
fearful invocation of spirits and ghosts.  The value placed on secular 
<br>
society is battered beyond recognition in the large portion of the world 
<br>
where Islam holds sway.  Throughout Latin America, an old priest in Rome has 
<br>
far more influence over public policy than any scientist could ever hope for. 
<br>
&nbsp;And in Europe a basically anti-rational &quot;naturism&quot; gives rise to one 
<br>
hysterical reaction against the concept of progress after another.
<br>
<p>Is it any wonder that in the midst of all this, I might feel embattled?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;
