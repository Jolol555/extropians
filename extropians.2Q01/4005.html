</em><br>
<p>A good point. I agree that Warwick is indeed doing a kind of
<br>
performance art. Engineering sometimes makes wonderful performance
<br>
art, and robotics is of course especially amenable to it. 
<br>
<p>But I think Stelarc has created something far more integrated than
<br>
Warwick. Stelarc's art is based in a postmodern
<br>
deconstruction/reconstruction of the body and its role, which is quite
<br>
consistent. The robotic and cyborg performances of Warwick does not
<br>
fit well with his views on the future of human and robot interactions
<br>
- one one hand slapstik and gadgetry, on the other hand the
<br>
terminator. It doesn't fit together artistically in my opinion. 
<br>
<p><p>[ The art critic as a science reviewer: &quot;While the logos and technique
<br>
of the paper are impeccable, there is a lack of pathos that weakens
<br>
the introduction and discussion section. The figures complement the
<br>
text, but the strength of the microphotographs overwhelm the quiet
<br>
cadence of the prose; especially the intense colors of the
<br>
immunological stainings would be more at home in a assertive rather
<br>
than exploratory paper.&quot; :-) ]
