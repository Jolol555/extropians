<p>
The search facilities provided by the new Javien host for
<br>
the Extropians' list archive resulted today in my making an
<br>
extremely startling and amusing discovery.
<br>
<p>Before describing it, I must provide some context by
<br>
revealing a bit more (not too tedious, I hope) autobiographical
<br>
detail than I have heretofore posted on this list.
<br>
<p>I moved to New York City at the end of 1978, following a
<br>
rather unsuccessful couple of years (almost) at an intentional
<br>
community in Virginia called Twin Oaks.  While supporting
<br>
myself as a computer operator at a New York bank, I was able
<br>
to resume my abandoned college career at New York University.
<br>
After taking a computer (assembly language) course with a
<br>
grad student there named Clint Goss, who became one of the
<br>
founders of a start-up software company, I got a job in
<br>
late '81 with that start-up company, called Philon.  A
<br>
lot of the folks who worked at Philon in the mid-80's have kept
<br>
in touch over the years, including Clint, another student
<br>
of his named Mark Meretzky, Mark's best friend Michael Goldfarb,
<br>
and a number of other pretty on-the-ball computer types.
<br>
Some of the friends of these friends have also been drawn into
<br>
the circle.
<br>
<p>Last summer (July 15), I was invited to Mark's 45th birthday
<br>
party at the Greenwich Village apartment of another ex-Philon,
<br>
Benny Pollak.  Also in attendance were Mark's friends Liz and
<br>
Victor Duchovni, with whom I have since become friends myself,
<br>
and who have invited me to dinner on many occasions (I've mentioned
<br>
Liz before -- she's the mathematician with the four- and six-year-old
<br>
sons, and Victor is a computer security expert at J. P. Morgan).
<br>
<p>O.K., that was the historical background.  Here's the proximate
<br>
background.
<br>
<p>Liz has a moderate taste for SF.  She was already familiar with authors
<br>
William Gibson and Bruce Sterling (I gave her a set of CDs of Gibson
<br>
reading _Neuromancer_, which she liked a lot), but I've introduced her
<br>
more recently to Greg Egan.  She loved _Permutation City_, and
<br>
has tackled _Diaspora_.  Well, naturally, that led to my mentioning
<br>
the Extropians' mailing list, which she has occasionally dipped into.
<br>
<p>One evening at dinner, Liz said to me, &quot;Victor and I know this
<br>
guy who intends, with perfect seriousness and as matter-of-factly
<br>
as you'd talk about buying a car, to live forever.  He sounds
<br>
like the kind of person who'd be interested in this Extropian
<br>
stuff.  I wonder if you've ever seen anything by him on the
<br>
list?  His name is Perry Metzger.&quot;  I answered that he certainly
<br>
wasn't one of the more recent regulars, but that I'd poke around
<br>
in the archive and see.  Listing by author in the old lucifer.com
<br>
archive, I did manage to come up with one 1997 item,
<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q97/4197.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q97/4197.html</a> ,
<br>
which seemed a bit in-your-face for somebody who wasn't even a
<br>
list regular (it's a harrumph along the lines of &quot;if you're
<br>
all so smart, how come you aren't all rich?&quot;), but which I forwarded
<br>
to Liz for her amusement.  She replied &quot;Yep, that's Perry, all right.
<br>
Some people think he's a bit full of himself, but I like him because
<br>
he seems to me like a pussycat trying to convince everybody
<br>
he's a lion.&quot;  She said she was going to invite him to her
<br>
Passover seder, and that I might get to meet him there.  I was
<br>
rather looking forward to meeting this character.
<br>
<p>I can just imagine what the conversation at the dinner table
<br>
would have been like if he had actually managed to make it
<br>
to Liz's seder:
<br>
<p>PERRY:  Well, you may not know this, but as a matter of fact
<br>
I actually **founded** the Extropians' mailing list.
<br>
<p>ME (out loud):  Oh really?
<br>
<p>ME (to myself):  Uh huh.  Sure, pal, tell me about it.  Good grief,
<br>
Liz warned me this guy might come off as a bit arrogant, but she
<br>
didn't tell me he was an out-and-out nut case!
<br>
<p>No doubt, Perry would have had some cause for irritation
<br>
as I sat there smirking and glancing at Liz, who would have
<br>
been listening with a half-puzzled smile on her face and
<br>
a twinkle in her eye as if to say &quot;I don't know what's going
<br>
to happen next, but this is turning out more interesting
<br>
than I anticipated.&quot;  It might almost have been a scene
<br>
worthy of a Woody Allen movie.  Unfortunately (or maybe just
<br>
as well!), Perry did **not** make it that evening.
<br>
<p>So what did I discover today as I experimented with the search
<br>
facilities at the Javien archive?  Well, as folks with more
<br>
of a clue about the history of the Extropians' than I had
<br>
will already know, I found evidence that one Perry E. Metzger
<br>
did indeed found this mailing list, for example:
<br>
<a href="http://forum.javien.com/forum/XMLmessage.php?id=id::ORYIIztK-DwFY-BlgR-OkJb-TExsdUVWYWps">http://forum.javien.com/forum/XMLmessage.php?id=id::ORYIIztK-DwFY-BlgR-OkJb-TExsdUVWYWps</a>
<br>
and
<br>
<a href="http://forum.javien.com/forum/XMLmessage.php?id=id::KnA8TzVH-ADAv-YmxV-PiZq-aT1ATDUHd2ww">http://forum.javien.com/forum/XMLmessage.php?id=id::KnA8TzVH-ADAv-YmxV-PiZq-aT1ATDUHd2ww</a>
<br>
<p>Well now I'll **have** to meet him, of course -- if nothing else,
<br>
so I can plague him to add his own personal list archives
<br>
from the earliest days when he was active (which he surely must
<br>
have kept, just out of sheer ego, if he's the founder) to the
<br>
Javien archive [*].  Liz has already promised to invite him to dinner
<br>
sometime soon.
<br>
<p>Not too long ago, I felt like a total outsider in this company,
<br>
even after having been posting for some months.  Now, I feel
<br>
a bit like the long-lost step-cousin of the Crown Princess
<br>
Anastasia.  ;-&gt;
<br>
<p>Jim F.
<br>
<p>[*] Hmm...  I've just heard something that may indicate that early
<br>
participants of this list were guaranteed anonymity outside the
<br>
list membership, and that it would be a violation of an implied
<br>
contract for the archives to extend any further back than 1996.
<br>
If so, that's a shame.
<br>
<p>The article in Wired news from a couple of weeks ago that announced
<br>
the restoration by Google of the Deja Usenet archives back to 1995
<br>
( <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,43392,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,43392,00.html</a> )
<br>
seems to be playing up the embarrassment factor for folks who were
<br>
hoping some of those old posts were gone forever.  I suppose it's
<br>
only a matter of time before somebody gets the bright idea to sue
<br>
Google for damages resulting from the unexpected return of an
<br>
indiscreet Usenet post.
<br>
<p>For my part, I'd be thrilled to death if Usenet could be pushed
<br>
back even further, to the 80's, even though I myself posted some
<br>
rather indiscreet articles to soc.motss back in '88 and '89 -- you
<br>
only expected them to last a few days before being displaced by
<br>
incoming news feed, in those days.
<br>
<p>Whatever happened to the motto &quot;information wants to be free&quot;?
<br>
Ah, well.
