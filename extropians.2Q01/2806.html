Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I participated in the extropy list back in 1993-1994 as an out democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialist, and eventually got flamed off. I've come back since the founding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the World Transhumanist Association, whose founding documents were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly less doctrinaire, both politically and in technophilia. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the space for a more diverse politics with &gt;human circles appears to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be getting broader as the ideas spread beyond the core demographic of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affluent, white American males aged 25-40 (within which I also fit), who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a weakness for the politics of selfishness, and a studied ignorance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inequality and oppression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There seem to be more social-democratic/left-leaning extropians on the list now
<br>
than when I last subscribed (sometime around 1993-1994 as well.)  An issue that
<br>
has always interested me is the question:  why do reasonable people of good
<br>
intent often arrive at sharply differing political philosophies?  In my own
<br>
case, I was raised in a Republican household in southern Idaho.  No doubt some
<br>
of my antipathy toward governmental solutions to social problems originated in
<br>
my parent's political philosophy, though I would now label myself an
<br>
anarchocapitalist of the David Friedman/Murray Rothbard variety.    (See below
<br>
for a few of the reasons behind my dislike for government and many left-leaning
<br>
organizations.)
<br>
<p>I often wonder however, if I had been born in a intellectual Jewish household
<br>
in Brooklyn of 1900, instead of a Mormon household in rural Idaho in the
<br>
1970's, would I now be an ardent Marxist, instead of an anarchocapitalist?
<br>
<p>If James, and the other social-democrat/left-oriented individuals are willing,
<br>
I would be grateful if you  took a little time to explain how you arrived at
<br>
your political beliefs.  Why do you think that your beliefs diverge sharply
<br>
from the majority of people on this list?  Were your parents of a similar
<br>
political persuasion?  Were there any defining events that shaped your
<br>
beliefs--a book you read, a job experience?  How have your beliefs changed over
<br>
time?    Please note that I realize it would take a great deal of time to
<br>
answer these questions in detail--thanks for any response you may wish to give.
<br>

<br>
<p>Why I'm Not a Social-Democrat
<br>
<p>Governments and left-leaning organizations, with a few exceptions, often seem
<br>
to behave in a way hostile to my other &quot;transhumanist&quot; goals--vastly increasing
<br>
human lifespan, increasing material wealth, space exploration, etc.
<br>
<p>Please note that I don't expect the examples that follow to change anyone's
<br>
mind--obviously, it would take more to change a lifetime of belief.  I include
<br>
these simply to show that, at least in my case, my opposition to
<br>
government/leftists is more than &quot;...just  have a weakness for the politics of
<br>
selfishness, and a studied ignorance of
<br>
inequality and oppression...&quot;
<br>
<p>* the FDA blocks the development/use of drugs and other medical advances
<br>
*  CFTC hinders the development of idea futures
<br>
*  NASA wastes money on economically pointless, but photogenic space missions
<br>
*  the British government will likely ban human cloning
<br>
*  the median families with two incomes pays 40% of their income in taxes
<br>
*  Organizations with left-leaning political views seem to be the most
<br>
vociferous opponents of animal research, gene therapy, cloning.  *  Baseless
<br>
scares, often promoted by left-leaning organizations, (think Alar, breast
<br>
implants) cost the companies involved billions of dollars, and stunt the
<br>
development of new technologies.  (For a time, Dow would not sell many medical
<br>
products containing silicone, for fear that those patient populations would
<br>
later sue.)
<br>
*  Zero population growth advocates, labor unions (until recently) fought
<br>
against free immigration, thereby hindering people like Max, Eugene, Sasha and
<br>
other extropians who happened to be born outside the U.S., from moving to a
<br>
location where their skills could find the best use.  Anti-immigration laws
<br>
also sharply limited the opportunities for illegal aliens, thereby reducing
<br>
their wages and ability to decline work under sweatshop conditions.
<br>
* Nominally socialist governments (Soviet Union, China, Cambodia) have been
<br>
responsible for many more deaths (Stalinist pogroms, mass starvation during the
<br>
Great Leap Forward, killing fields)  than a certain German political party
<br>
well-known for its bad behavior.  I know that these governments aren't
<br>
considered &quot;real&quot; socialism by modern leftists, but whatever the name, I'm
<br>
still very wary of groups that call for large increases in government power in
<br>
order to curb the alleged deficiencies in capitalism.
<br>
*  The first minimum wage laws in the U.S. were passed after the Civil War in
<br>
the South because white workers did not want to have to compete with the newly
<br>
freed slaves, who were willing to work for less money.  These laws have the
<br>
same practical effect today, even though those pushing for them now may not be
<br>
overtly racist.
<br>
*  Drug war (pushed by the DEA, as well as state local law enforcement
<br>
agencies) has resulted in more people (most of them black or other minorities).
<br>
imprisoned in the U.S. than any other country
