<p>I would predict that all the lists except for the &quot;party and light
<br>
conversation&quot; list would quickly die; that list would then become
<br>
indistinguishable from the original list.
<br>
<p>Personally, I really enjoy the list the way it is - it's like an anarchic
<br>
Extropian soap opera / talk show. It's the best show not on TV.
<br>
<p>I think that Email lists, warts and all, are one of the most effective
<br>
styles of forum for maintaining a subscriber base; very low friction... once
<br>
you are subscribed, very little proactivity is required to participate (and
<br>
no little amount of effort is required to remove yourself). Be careful
<br>
before moving to a web-based forum instead of an email list.I know email
<br>
seems sooo stone age, but it's working... we have some evidence already that
<br>
a web forum isn't necessarily better.
