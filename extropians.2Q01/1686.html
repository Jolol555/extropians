<em>&gt; When you mention the Eternal Return, I reach for my phaser!  Neitszche is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cool, but I suspect that if he is correct, then the information is useless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It becomes, what Philosopher, John Leslie, calls &quot;value death'. Back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival, in a longer mode; we need to see if we or they (AI) can produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digital analogs of the mammal brain, or see if synthesized brain/minds are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to us. If they get bored, in either case, then we will have to face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up to the eternity of boredom, and its resolution. Sometimes taking long
</em><br>
naps
<br>
<em>&gt; seems to help resolve boredom, though not depression. Can AI SI's become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depressed?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I discovered ER before reading Nietzsche, and only learned later
<br>
that he had assigned it this term (which made it that much easier to
<br>
understand ER). Since ER has nothing to do with philosophy, and everything to
<br>
do with reality, it has value in proportion as anyone imputes value to
<br>
reality. Of course AIs can become depressed. We're all AIs because
<br>
intelligence is artificial. By extrapolation, SIs will become super depressed,
<br>
that's why you don't see the universe filled with intelligence. Intelligence
<br>
understands ER, and finds no reason to continue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am taking a psychologically, linear, view, and with all due respect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Master Neitszche, I am supposing that this universe that we have so far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detected is linear (or helical as Ben Goertzel suggests) and that we, as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species, live in a cosmos that is 'merely' 12-15 Giga years old. Taking that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view &quot;we&quot; have not been down this road before. Or if we have, we have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recollection, therefore its utterly, unimportant.
</em><br>
<p>That's right. We are utterly unimportant, and we have been down this road an
<br>
infinite number of times before. Forgetfulness accompanies us each and every
<br>
time, until at last we understand how it all works. Then we understand the
<br>
meaning of importance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we find a mass storage, place that indicates that Neitszche was correct,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then we have to ask, &quot;Is they, us?&quot;  If they is merely replicas, lets do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something fun! Then lets take a nap. Beats the crap out of mopping floors,
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt; cutting cane.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course, the mass storage place is between your ears. Yes, they is us.
<br>
Each Big Bang is a replica of all the previous ones, just like every helium
<br>
atom is a replica of all the others.
<br>

<p>Hunger disappears when you're having fun,
