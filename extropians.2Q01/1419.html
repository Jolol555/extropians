<p><em>&gt; Hmmm, so the point is whether the observer (zombie) takes an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional interest in what task he has been 'programmed' to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond to, which implies the freudian term, ego. An analogy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be in a horror movie where the zombie chases after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victim because 'brain stops pain' rather then the non-zombie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who wants to kick the victim's ass to the curb, out of pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vengence or spite.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; It's almost better to change the question, then, to whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am a zombie or an emotional zombie?  Either way, I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pay taxes. Or more significantly, does qualia matter?
</em><br>
<p>I think that you are visualizing a zombie as a self-contained
<br>
robot of some kind.  Dennett, Hal Finney, me, and many others
<br>
maintain that any self-contained unit that behaves at a level
<br>
that is indistinguishable from human, MUST have consciousness,
<br>
feelings, etc. (or more).
<br>
<p>In other words, in the classic definition, there cannot be any
<br>
such thing as a zombie.  So no observer can be a zombie, because
<br>
they cannot exist.  It's either an emulation --- in which case
<br>
it has everything that we do, or it's a simulation --- in which
<br>
case it's merely a portrayal, a moving picture, as it were.
<br>
<p>If what is chasing you is self-contained, has intelligence,
<br>
appears to have emotions (&quot;Kill! Kill!&quot;), then it's a creature
<br>
that indeed does have consciousness, even emotions, however muted. 
<br>
(Antoniu Damiaso &quot;A Feeling of What Happens&quot;, and several
<br>
evolutionary biologists like Geoffrey Miller &quot;The Mating Mind&quot;
<br>
and Sarah Hrdy &quot;Mother Nature&quot;, explain the need for emotion
<br>
for the making of decisions in people and animals.)
<br>
<p>But if a three-dimensional holographic portrayal (that looks 
<br>
just like Wolfman) appears in your office or living room, and
<br>
begins to chase you  (&quot;Kill! Maim!&quot;), yet in truth happens to
<br>
be a puppet manipulated by an SI, then &quot;it&quot; isn't really a
<br>
creature at all, only an image of one.  So even if you deliver
<br>
an insult so graphic that it would cripple any human-level
<br>
creature, the image, of course, will be unaffected, and
<br>
the SI will only chuckle.
<br>
<p>So, since we maintain zombies to be impossible, we say that you
<br>
cannot be either kind.  As for &quot;do qualia matter?&quot;, that's a
<br>
philosophic death spiral.  Dennett is right in saying that
<br>
the concept of qualia is one that we can do without.
