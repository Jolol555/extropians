<p><p>There is a detectable difference between types of amplifier 
<br>
components.  Specifically, the nature and spectra of the harmonic 
<br>
distortion varies depending on the type of device.  Vacuum tubes have a 
<br>
more pleasant sounding distortion mode than most transistors.  This is what 
<br>
the audiophiles are generally referring to, because distortion is audible 
<br>
on crappy or older components.
<br>
<p>Where the argument gets stupid in the world of audio, is that most modern 
<br>
components generate an imperceptible amount of harmonic distortion, so 
<br>
differences in the theoretical distortion functions are largely irrelevant 
<br>
to the sound of the device.  Contrary to what Brian seems to imply, it is 
<br>
trivial to add &quot;tube distortion&quot; in the digital domain as the distortion 
<br>
modes of tubes are well-known.  In fact, for real world audio applications 
<br>
tube distortion *is* frequently added digitally (after recording through 
<br>
extremely low distortion transistor amps), giving all the harmonics of 
<br>
crappy tubes without the noise.
<br>
<p>The primary problem is that a lot of people believe &quot;tubes sound better 
<br>
than transistors&quot; without knowing why.  If they did know why, they would 
<br>
also know that a high-quality modern tube amp will effectively sound the 
<br>
same as a high-quality transistor amp.  Some people intentionally use their 
<br>
amps hard in attempts to get harmonic distortion, but that seems kind of 
<br>
stupid since it shortens the lifespan of the amp and it is cheap to add 
<br>
easily controlled distortion with a little DSP in the signal chain.
