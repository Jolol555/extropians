<p>I wouldn't put it in so absolute form, but guessing that you're not 
<br>
using the lately inflationary diluted &quot;nanotechnology&quot;, but meaning 
<br>
molecular manufacturing, you're of course correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; going.  Until somebody demonstrates machine-phase is even *possible*
</em><br>
<p>Well, we do have parts of NEMS, especially those derived from 
<br>
graphenes. Have you missed the jack-in-the-box electrostatic
<br>
linear actuators, which are made from concentric buckys and 
<br>
use van der Waals forces as springs to pull back what you
<br>
protracted with a potential? That was flashy, as was the 
<br>
selective fractionation of bucky batches through electric
<br>
pulse lysis of metallic fraction of the tubes, while transiently
<br>
biasing the semiconducting fraction into isolators.
<br>
<p>While still expensive, production of buckys is being rapidly scaled
<br>
up due to their anticipated use in high-end structural materials.
<br>
Now buckys are relatively large molecules, but they're molecules.
<br>
It doesn't take a Merkle to realize that you can probably use a
<br>
MEMS microfab to fractionate these things (not necessarily 
<br>
destructively) with sufficiently high processivity for practical
<br>
use (desktop device with a throughput of gram/hour, scalable to
<br>
larger sizes).
<br>
<p>Maybe this isn't the catholic bootstrap route, but that was
<br>
exactly my point. The vein's so rich you get showered with emeralds
<br>
wherever you dig.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it's way premature to expect it to even be practical, never mind superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to liquid-phase &quot;nanotech&quot; - i.e., the biotech being belittled.
</em><br>
<p>Strictly speaking, we do know that machine phase exists. It's just
<br>
a fancy version of what biological enzymes do, after all. I can
<br>
cite you paper and verse, people have been doing chemistry with
<br>
the crude proximal probe tools we have. The question is, is the
<br>
repertoire of mechanosynthetic reactions sufficiently rich for a
<br>
structure to be able to deposit a copy of the structure itself?
<br>
Given how much we found poking around so little, the answer seems
<br>
to be a tentative yes.
<br>
<p>But do we need machine-phase self-rep capable nanotechnology? Sure,
<br>
it would be nifty. But computronium built with self-assembling
<br>
molecular electronics is accessible with classical chemical and 
<br>
biological means already.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Ditto for AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI can't even do grammar checks yet.  Moore's law may pull it out yet.  Or may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, depending on how efficiently Mother Nature used our neurons and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high a frequency of gamma rays we can focus.
</em><br>
<p>There are two disparate issues at stake here: hardware and software.
<br>
Moore is about integration density, and will be going for about a decade,
<br>
and then after that, because people have finally started doing R&amp;D
<br>
into molecular electronics in earnest. I don't know why it took two
<br>
decades to realize that's a worthwhile goal, but the train is picking
<br>
up steam, finally.
<br>
<p>A less widely known law indicates that the ROI on transistors as
<br>
measured in CPU performance has started to run into diminishing 
<br>
returns. The reasons are many, and most of them architectural. This is
<br>
a good thing, because it states that sooner or later people will
<br>
be forced to abandon the current axis of impetus, and explore a
<br>
hitherto negliged side alley. The results of this architecture change
<br>
will result into dramatic improvements of real-world performance
<br>
from the same amount of transistors.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Incidentally, this architectural shift should take at least a decade,
<br>
and coincide with the advent of molecular electronics. This is even
<br>
better, because the new architecture due to their orthogonality, small
<br>
grain size, scalability and intrinsic self-healing (through adaptive 
<br>
reconfiguration) capabilities will allow even primitive molecular 
<br>
electronics to be rapidly deployed.
<br>
<p>The software issue. Well, the software issue. I do not expect
<br>
anything from the mainstream. Comp. sci. people, software engineers,
<br>
that's you. Sure, algorithms will be translated into circuits --
<br>
a desktop version of what silicon compilers are doing now. If you
<br>
undust your wizard book, you'll see how it's done -- it's not hard.
<br>
Swapping out pages will swap out circuits, not code. Crunch will
<br>
fall out of the bunghole, and be used for fancy dumb robots.
<br>
<p>None of this will suffice to create naturally intelligent machines,
<br>
who're smart enough to be able to compete with us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm all for planning ahead; but none of the advanced stuff we talk about is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imminent.  AI is the only possibility for this generation.  Nanotech is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a speculation.  Biotech may produce wonderful stuff soon; but we're not
</em><br>
<p>Strange, in my particular universe molecular circuitry is knocking on
<br>
the doors, and AI is soon to follow, unless we outlaw darwin in machina.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; about to improve brains yet because we don't know how, and we'll need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be *very* sure before we do it.  Even an AI &quot;singularity&quot; won't be a
</em><br>
<p>Well, we do have smarter mice, and smarter worms now. People are about
<br>
to sequence the chimps, and look at the delta in gene expression in
<br>
their brains, so I wouldn't be betting on a timeline. But given 
<br>
how long it will take until the technique is validated, morally approved,
<br>
widely deployed and results into more IQ points for the average child...
<br>
<p>The other fields should be noticeably quicker on the time scale.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; singularity.  We'll shift from a 20-year doubling time to a 18-month
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubling time, until Moore's law runs out.  It'll be like the whole world
</em><br>
<p>I don't expect the Moore's law to run out for a long time. If it's
<br>
timed right, molecular electronics will smoothly take over when photolitho
<br>
saturates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; is a successful startup company for a few years to a few decades;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it will be over.
</em><br>
<p>Ha! MorePolice, arrest this man. He's acting defaetist in public, 
<br>
his extropian license needs to be revoked.
