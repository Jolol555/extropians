Anders mentioned the insidious memetic virus encouraging us to worship
<br>
recent sf from Scotland. Actually this temptation is completely justified,
<br>
but more subtle than it looks. The virus propagates through sf writers
<br>
sharing the Scottish patronymic prefix, though some are Irish, English or
<br>
even American: Ken MacLeod, Ian R. MacLeod, Ian McDonald, Wil McCarthy,
<br>
Paul McAuley, Iain M. Banks. (The M., of course, is short for `Mac'.)
<br>
<p>Here's a nice exhortative fragment from Paul McAuley's wonderful new novel,
<br>
a detail-rich road movie on Mars and 2026ish Earth, with lashings of
<br>
inventive but persuasive and informed genomics; a fine, kinetic account of
<br>
scientific work performed, so to speak, as an action flick:
<br>
<p>==================
<br>
<p>To realise that the world is, yes, so much stranger than human imagination.
<br>
Why make things up, when all around are wonders of the world waiting to be
<br>
unriddled?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no mysteries, Mariella thinks, only unrevealed truths. If people
<br>
will only do a little work, will subject themselves to a little discipline,
<br>
a little effort, then they too can understand, they too will be amazed not
<br>
by mystery but by truth. But they don't. Science has built a vast edifice
<br>
of thought that reaches out to the furthest ends of the Universe, all the
<br>
way back in time to the first femtosecond of the Universe's creation, all
<br>
the way forward to matter's final end in the dissolution of protons, a
<br>
hundred billion years from now. A cathedral of thought built by the
<br>
cooperation of hundreds of thousands of minds, the greatest achievement of
<br>
humanity. But most will not even acknowledge it, much less try to
<br>
understand it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still remembers the casual slights and sneers of certain pompous arts
<br>
students at Cambridge. The moneyed as oblivious to their wealth as fish to
<br>
water, interested only in maintaining the status quo, with braying upper
<br>
middle class students their eager collaborators. Proud in their ignorance
<br>
of science, yet scornful of those who were not interested in the minutia[e]
<br>
of Renaissance art, opera, or the intricacies of their social seasons.
<br>
Mariella knows now that their scorn was based on fear. To them, scientists
<br>
are useful but dangerous, and so must be kept in their place, like Morlocks
<br>
in the engine-room of the world. And most people take their cue from their
<br>
leaders, believe that science is a conspiracy only the initiated few can
<br>
understand, something to be feared. It is partly the fault of mediocre
<br>
scientists, of course, who react to criticism like spoiled priests fearful
<br>
of defrocking, but it is mostly the fault of those who in their ignorance
<br>
set themselves as the legislators of science, and those, their prejudices
<br>
set in stone, who have declared themselves to be its moral superiors.
