<em>&gt; As for your assertion that my distaste for cultural relativism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religiously derived, does that mean that science, which states that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Einstein's theory is THE law of gravitation and superior to any law of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravitation that uses an inverse-cube law, is religiously derived?
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, I do think that, at its heart, Western science's quest for &quot;one true
<br>
equation&quot; underlying everything can be directly derived from Judeochristian
<br>
religion with its &quot;one true god.&quot;
<br>
<p>Perhaps the universe is not actually structured such that there is one
<br>
compact pattern that explains everything, either in the domain of spiritual
<br>
experience or in the domain of physical law.  Perhaps there are multiple
<br>
overlapping patterns....  This is how it seems right now in the physics
<br>
domain -- quantum theory and general relativity being examples of deep,
<br>
overlapping, difficult-to-unify patterns -- but we, our archetypal view
<br>
being the Judeochristian &quot;one true law&quot; approach, persist in believing there
<br>
MUST be an elegant underlying unifying equation....  Perhaps the one who
<br>
creates the next great physics theory will be an AI who lacks this bias!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Cultural relativism is not a means of finding truth; it is an excuse for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoiding the social discomfort that sometimes accompanies the act of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressing an uncomfortable truth or a truth which is not widely held.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cultural relativism is a defection in the game known as Finding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Truth.  Things can get better only if people are willing to speak the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I think that both cultural relativism and &quot;absolute truthism&quot; (to coin a
<br>
phrase to characterize the opposite extreme) can be used in good or bad
<br>
ways.  [Yes, I'm aware that the notions of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; in the previous
<br>
sentence can be interpreted in either a culturally relative or an absolutist
<br>
way.  I believe that sentence is true under BOTH interpretations.]
<br>
<p>You know that classic picture that looks like either a vase or a pair of
<br>
faces, depending on how you look at it.  Or the Necker cube, which can look
<br>
like it's pointing in, or out.  Perhaps reality is like this in some
<br>
respects, but with vastly more than two complementary views.  One can make a
<br>
mathematical argument in this regard, though I don't have time to do so
<br>
right now.
<br>
<p>I agree that some of the advocates of cultural relativism are habitual
<br>
abusers of the notion.  On the other hand, so are some of the advocates of
<br>
absolute truthism.
<br>
<p>For instance, it seems extreme to me to claim that music from all different
<br>
cultures can be &quot;compared&quot; in some way, so that the best Chinese opera can
<br>
be judged objectively against the best Western opera. Yet, within a single
<br>
culture, comparison is much easier -- there's something close to a consensus
<br>
about which Western operas are great and which are not, and which Chinese
<br>
operas are great and which are not.  Traditionally, adherents of absolute
<br>
truthism claimed that Western  music was intrinsically superior to all other
<br>
forms of music, which were somehow primitive and intrinsically inharmonious.
<br>
Actually, to a large extent, these critics just had culturally-biased
<br>
&quot;ears&quot;.  On the other hand, it also seems extreme to me to claim that all
<br>
forms of music are equally good -- some cultures, for instance, really ARE
<br>
(in my intuition, and overall cross-cultural human consensus) more musically
<br>
prodigous than others.
<br>
<p>Real truth seems to be an interesting mix of absolutism and relativism;
<br>
either extreme attitude is an unproductive one.
<br>
I think that a mix of absolutism and relativism is best.  Funnily enough,
<br>
this is what most humans have evolved to profess.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; The thing is that there is just not enough objective data to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; two political parties as similar as the ones we have in the US.  So the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; choice largely comes down to bias, or habit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are more than two parties.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  I was assuming that our &quot;default person&quot; had made the consensus
<br>
decision to vote for a candidate who had a plausible chance of winning.
<br>
<p>I myself didn't make that consensus decision; I voted Green in the last
<br>
Presidential election, whereas my mom voted Democrat and my dad voted
<br>
Communist, just for the hell of it, because he wanted to vote for Bush but
<br>
his wife threatened to kill him if he did ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My personal philosophy is unambiguous on this topic; it says &quot;You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't believe something because it benefits you; you should believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things because they're true.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I'm looking forward to your absolute and incontrovertible definition of
<br>
truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Nietzsche said &quot;People believe what they need to believe in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; survive.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Screw him.
</em><br>
<p>he's dead.  yuck.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Science isn't somebody's opinion.
</em><br>
<p>It's no individual's opinion, but it may be a mass nonlinear superposition
<br>
of many peoples' opinions.
<br>
<p>The &quot;physical world&quot; itself may be this, actually.  This is the direction in
<br>
which quantum gravity leads us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben, take a stand on something.  You'll feel better.
</em><br>
<p>Eli, take a few hits of blotter acid...
<br>
<p>The merits of cultural relativism will flood into your head like you can't
<br>
even imagine  ;&gt;
