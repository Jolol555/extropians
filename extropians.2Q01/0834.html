<p>The overall effects remains to be seen, we are just now right in the

middle (start?) of things and it is hard to see what happens (despite
<br>
my regular dismay at the bad news Slashdot brings). But my point is
<br>
that by looking at how societies have reacted to new technology at
<br>
different points in their own &quot;individual&quot; development curve we can
<br>
perhaps make some useful predictions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I agree with your view about the need for understanding new
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; problems above are not magically solved by even strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nanotech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nope. Human problems usually turn out to have human solutions: the tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we use in reaching those solutions are incidental, although they often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make life a lot easier. But ...
</em><br>
<p>There is a feedback between a society and its technology: new
<br>
technology enable new possibilities, but if they are taken and how
<br>
they are taken depends on the society, and this will of course change
<br>
it. Dropping a computer into the library of Alexandria would not have
<br>
caused a scientific revolution, the culture was simply wrong for it. 
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Scarcity is not just an issue of lack of resources or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; production capacity, it is also an issue of distribution and economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system. Under a Rob Mugabe even a nanotech society might starve. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but you missed another thing: in a nanotech society, scarcity may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a function of broken intellectual property laws, inadequate education,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a government that can't attract capital investment inflow, and probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half a dozen other factors we don't know about yet. Distribution and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic problems are a hallmark of the industrial and mass production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; era. We're going somewhere else ... talk about &quot;mass customization&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only the tip of the iceberg.
</em><br>
<p>True. In the end, we need good institutions and a culture receptive to
<br>
the new technology to really bring it off the ground and able to help
<br>
humans develop their potential. It is a very tricky bootstrapping problem.
