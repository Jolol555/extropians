<em>&gt; RUSSELL:  Well, they exhorted people.  And, uh, didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bother about seeing that the armies held the frontiers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or anything like that, or that the taxation system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was reformed.  They were occupied in founding monasteries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and nunneries and so forth, and thought that far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more important than preserving the Empire.  Well, so, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the present day, when the human race is falling, I find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, uh, eminent divines think that it's much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important to prevent artificial insemination than it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to prevent the kind of world war that will exterminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole lot of us.  And that seems to me to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lack of sense of proportion.
</em><br>
<p>Things haven't changed much. The US thinks it more important to teach
<br>
Political Correctitude than to defend its borders (indicating the US
<br>
Empire may be on the same trajectory, only faster). Bush's brand of
<br>
religionism doesn't bode well for non-theist extropic expansion either.
<br>
And although by no means the intellectual peer of Russell, nevertheless
<br>
Jesse Ventura summed up the situation forcefully by saying &quot;Religion is
<br>
for weak minded people.&quot;
<br>
<p>Russell did perhaps an even better job of summing up the relation of
<br>
religion and cruelty:
<br>
&quot;You find this curious fact, that the more intense has been the religion
<br>
of any period and the more profound has been the dogmatic belief, the
<br>
greater has been the cruelty and the worse has been the state of affairs.&quot;
<br>
[Why I Am Not A Christian, 1927]
<br>
<p>I liked Russell the moment I laid eyes on WINAC in the school library (at
<br>
age 12), and I still enjoy a volume of his quotations. Here's another on
<br>
science:
<br>
<p>&quot;These various forms of madness -- communism, nazism, Japanese
<br>
imperialism -- are the natural result of the impact of science on nations
<br>
with a strong pre-scientific culture. The effects in Asia are still at an
<br>
early stage. The effects on the native races of Africa have hardly begun.
<br>
It is therefore unlikely that the world will recover sanity in the near
<br>
future.
<br>
[The Science To Save Us From Science, 1950]
<br>
<p>Great brains have their foibles... Russell was also famous for his &quot;Ban
<br>
The Bomb&quot; position. Seems like one of the hazards of genius is the
<br>
occasional flight into nonsense. Note the same silliness occurred with
<br>
Linus Pauling and vitamin C; Einstein and Zionism, etc.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia
