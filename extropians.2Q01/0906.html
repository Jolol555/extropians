<p>
You sound very confident of your argument, given all the assumptions!
<br>
<p>The *major* assumption is that qualia are something, rather than a figment
<br>
of our imagination. There is a major camp in the consciousness debate
<br>
(Dennett et al) who say that qualia are so difficult to describe and define
<br>
because they are not real. Personally, I still lean toward qualia existing
<br>
and meaning something, but I could be swayed the other way... the jury is
<br>
definitely out on this question.
<br>
<p>Secondly, you assume that qualia are not physical. You assume that, given
<br>
some future time when we can simulate a being exactly, that the physical
<br>
description used to simulate the person does not contain any mechanism to
<br>
implement qualia. So qualia are somehow otherworldly, intangible things.
<br>
<p>Thirdly, and importantly, you assume that qualia are not epiphenomena, which
<br>
would emerge implicitly from the operation of a brain simulation, given that
<br>
the brain simulation is identical in operation to the original brain. If
<br>
qualia were an emergent property, they should emerge from the sim just as
<br>
the original, excepting if there is something sacred in the meat (shades of
<br>
mvt and similar silliness).
<br>
<p>So we are left to entertain the notion that qualia are otherworldly, not
<br>
emergent, and do not attach automatically to simulations. So somehow, the
<br>
meat brain attracts these otherwordly qualia, but the sim does not. Why?
<br>
This is definitely not obvious.
<br>
<p>An important addendum... Qualia are either worldly or other worldy. That is,
<br>
some physical process implements them, or none does. Most arguments
<br>
regarding qualia say that they are otherworldy, because they are used to
<br>
define identity (I eff therefore I am), and identity does not follow rules
<br>
of information (cannot be copied; identity forks) thus qualia cannot be
<br>
copied, thus qualia cannot be material/informational. They are &quot;other&quot;.
<br>
<p>Let's entertain the otherworldly hypothesis; let us say for argument's sake
<br>
that they are indeed from the netherworld.
<br>
<p>The big problem with this, is that we all agree that the brain (and other
<br>
bits of the body) implements some part of our intelligence. Most would agree
<br>
that it certainly implements awareness... all the levels of processing from
<br>
sensation to being aware of a thing; and also the physical analogous control
<br>
mechanism, from deciding to do something back down to doing it.
<br>
<p>So in the scenario I am entertaining, there is a physical component, and an
<br>
&quot;otherworldy&quot; component, to conscious intelligence (to us, at least).
<br>
Further, the otherworldly component has a material, measurable effect on the
<br>
physical component... that's how *real* consciousnesses can talk about
<br>
effing red, while hypothesised zombies would say &quot;Eff? What the F?&quot;. Somehow
<br>
the experience of qualia is communicated to the physical components, to be
<br>
communicated to others via sound, for instance.
<br>
<p>But... if this is so, then there must be some interface with which the
<br>
otherworldly interacts with the worldly. At some point, for example, some
<br>
set of neurons must react to invisible input, where they behave differently
<br>
than the laws of physics say they should. This *must* happen for the two
<br>
mechanisms to interact. We can talk about &quot;effing red&quot;, so either we are
<br>
mistaken about it, or something real is happening in our brain to make us be
<br>
able to talk about it.
<br>
<p>What do we conclude when we find the world violating physics? When we have
<br>
exhausted our alternatives, we must include the new behaviour in our rules;
<br>
we must conclude that our old rules were wrong/incomplete.
<br>
<p>The only important thing about qualia, in this scenario, is the measurable
<br>
effect on the physical. If we can measure that (non-linear modification of
<br>
neuronal behaviour due to no mechanism that we can explain), then we should
<br>
be able to model it, given enough information. It becomes another one of
<br>
those models, like the atom, that we know represents reality, at least
<br>
isomorphically, by it's consistent and predictable effects.
<br>
<p>Thus, qualia creep into the realm of the physical. Suddenly, we can simulate
<br>
not only the physical parts of human intelligence, but also the so-called
<br>
non physical aspects, the ghostly qualia. You can ask the simulation what
<br>
salty is like, and it will answer (truthfully) in the same way as any human,
<br>
because it has a true simulation of qualia, just as true as the rest of it's
<br>
sim-grey-matter.
<br>
<p>Thus, I think it is clear that qualia are simulatable; either they are
<br>
physical, and so measurable and simulatable, or they are intangible, but
<br>
have tangible effects, which are in themselves simulatable. If the second
<br>
case is true, the &quot;qualia themselves&quot; are slashed away by Occam; the effect
<br>
is all that is necessary.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let me briefly give an explicit argument for why simulated beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deserve the same consideration as real ones.  Basically I will claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that there is no fundamental difference between a simulated and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; real being.  I know this is a radical claim but see if the chain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasoning below is convincing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amongst extropians this isn't that radical of a claim.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be your basic extropian dogma which 99% of extropians seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refuse to question regardless of the evidence against it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Real human beings have all of their consciousness tied up in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain.  The activity of the brain somehow produces the consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that makes us want to care about them morally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Great so far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We know the brain works by the activity of neural cells which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interact with each other via chemical and electrical messages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Likewise they get information from and send signals to the outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world via similar messages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is where you start to lose it.  The important thing is, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message must have some kind of receiver or final resulting knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is more than messages in our brain.  The messages from our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensors ultimately end up being our conscious knowledge.  Conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge isn't a message, it is the result of a message.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The signal our tongue produces when it comes in contact with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sodium chloride results, in our brain, the conscious knowledge that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salty.  In order for your argument to hold true some abstract binary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number must be able to do the same thing as this salty qualia our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain uses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, a sufficiently complex binary number can &quot;causally&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model anything a salty qualia can, but this is missing the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important part of consciousness.  In order to know the true meaning of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this binary number, you must map it back to salty.  The binary number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be represented by a paper tape, ferrite on a disk, the state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some transistors on an IC, or buss line...  It doesn't matter to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation.  But to us it does matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When people experience &quot;synesthesia&quot; incorrect conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge results from our senses.  Sodium chloride could result in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; red sensation, for example.  Red could also abstractly represent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sodium chloride just like a binary number could.  But anyone that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinks it doesn't matter whether we represent sodium chloride with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salty or red - wouldn't they be really off their rocker?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can ask a real conscious person what salt is like.  Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day we will be able to eff and communicate these sensations.  We're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already starting to artificially produce qualia (points of light and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds) via artificial stimulation in blind people, for example.  When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you ask a simulation what red is like what will it say?  If it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being honest it will say it's salty is an abstract number and not like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything.  When you want to eff with a simulation so that you can know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what it's representation of salt is like, how could it be possible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to have anything to eff?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once we have enough ability to perform this Moravekian trick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and start to replace neurons with other material people will finally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize that even if the external behavior remains the same, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenal conscious qualites will cease to exist.  The people will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finally discover (or finally realize what we've all known all along)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that our consciousness knowledge is constructed of phenomenal qualia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Though what this conscious stuff is phenomenally like can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated, there is nothing really and fundamentally like it.
