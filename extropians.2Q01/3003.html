<p>New Research Confirms That Natural Selection Is Acting On The Current Human 
<br>
Population
<br>
<p>New evidence suggests that natural selection is leading women to have their 
<br>
first child at earlier ages. This is shown to be an inherited evolutionary 
<br>
change that is taking place despite the influence of social factors such as 
<br>
religion and education.
<br>
The findings, by a team of British, Australian and American scientists, show 
<br>
for the first time that both genetic and social factors, such as religion 
<br>
and education, are having a profound effect on the timing of human 
<br>
reproduction. These factors are influencing human evolution to a greater 
<br>
extent than at any time in the pre-history of humans.
<br>
<p>Writing in the latest edition of the journal Evolution, the researchers 
<br>
reveal that women who reproduce earlier in their lives have higher Darwinian 
<br>
fitness. They show that this trend is being passed on from generation to 
<br>
generation through natural selection - the process where successful genes 
<br>
pass on to successive generations through evolution.
<br>
<p>These findings are different from previous studies of pre-industrialised 
<br>
populations, where the age at women start their periods is the best 
<br>
predictor of the number of children that they will eventually produce.
<br>
<p>The differences in behaviour are probably due to changes in society that 
<br>
occurred along side industrialisation, such as freely available 
<br>
contraception for women and better healthcare and nutrition for children.
<br>
<p>Dr Ian Owens of the Department of Biology and Biochemistry at Imperial 
<br>
College, an author on the paper, described the significance of their 
<br>
research:
<br>
<p>“The most important finding is that changes in society, such as 
<br>
freely-available birth control for women and eradication of several 
<br>
important childhood diseases, which have taken place in the last 20 to 30 
<br>
years will probably lead to genetic changes in humans through evolution.
<br>
<p>“We can say this because the sorts of factors that we found that are 
<br>
associated with reproduction now aren’t the same ones that people had found 
<br>
in pre-industrial populations.”
<br>
<p>The findings were made after an exhaustive three-year analysis of 
<br>
questionnaire data from 2,710 pairs of identical and non-identical twins 
<br>
held in the Australian Twin Registry (ATR).
<br>
<p>After removing the influence of differences in religion, education and the 
<br>
effect of the baby boom, the researchers still found heritable genetic 
<br>
differences in three key ‘life history’ traits. These are the age at which 
<br>
women started their periods, had their first baby, and reached menopause.
<br>
<p>Each of these traits was found to be genetically associated with ‘fitness’ - 
<br>
the ability of an organism to reproduce itself because it is well adapted to 
<br>
its environment.
<br>
<p>Out of the three traits it is the age that women had their first baby, which 
<br>
is most significantly associated with reproductive fitness. This means that 
<br>
genes influencing an early age of reproduction in the female population will 
<br>
become more common. In other words, women’s genes will predispose them to 
<br>
start reproducing earlier.
<br>
<p>Dr Owens believes this work has identified a ‘genetic phenomenon’ that is 
<br>
likely to have many implications in terms of how human behaviour will change 
<br>
over the next few hundred years.
<br>
<p>The influence of social factors on inherited genetic change
<br>
<p>Evolutionary biologists have long agreed that the life history of modern 
<br>
humans has been moulded by evolution due to selection that occurred in the 
<br>
past.
<br>
<p>Hotly debated however, is whether human life history traits are still under 
<br>
selection, and whether changes in human culture have led to new forms of 
<br>
selection.
<br>
<p>Part of the twin data analysis aimed to discover the effect that social, 
<br>
psychological and historical factors had on the number and timing of 
<br>
children born to the 2,710 pairs of twins studied.
<br>
<p>The researchers found many of the variations in the three traits were 
<br>
controlled by social factors such as religion and education. For example, 
<br>
Roman Catholic women had 20 per cent higher reproductive fitness than other 
<br>
religions. University educated women had 35 per cent lower fitness than 
<br>
those who left school as early as possible.
<br>
<p>“I was staggered by the results we got,” said Dr Owens. “When we decided to 
<br>
control for these factors, I wasn’t expecting anything to come out of it. I 
<br>
thought, ‘let’s just run with the analysis’. But there was a massive 
<br>
difference in the number of children born to families with a religious 
<br>
affiliation. Many of the Catholic twins we studied had an average family of 
<br>
five children, where other families were having only one or two children.
<br>
<p>“We also found that mothers with more education were typically having just 
<br>
one child at an older age. Their reproductive fitness was much lower than 
<br>
their peers who left school as early as possible. Again, and again, our 
<br>
analyses for these two factors came back with the same results.”
<br>
<p>The influence of religion and education in family size may seem an obvious 
<br>
finding - but what the scientists found really astonishing was that after 
<br>
controlling for these social factors, genetic changes were influencing the 
<br>
three life traits studied.
<br>
<p>“Even after we controlled for these social factors, there was still lots of 
<br>
genetically heritable genetic variation in the three life history traits. 
<br>
This is a really unexpected finding.”
<br>
<p>However, he cautions against linking this work with the possibility of a 
<br>
eugenic programme for selective human breeding.
<br>
<p>“Looking to the future, I would expect to pick up genetic changes within the 
<br>
ten generations since industrialisation. However, what this work doesn’t 
<br>
indicate or find, is a genetic marker for human reproduction - so you can’t 
<br>
breed for early reproduction from our data. All the traits that we have 
<br>
examined are controlled by interactions between the environment and many 
<br>
genes.”
<br>
<p>The future work aims to understand more fully, the contribution 
<br>
psychological factors make, says Dr Owens. “We also want to repeat our 
<br>
experiments using twins databases elsewhere, to really put our results into 
<br>
a ‘western world’ context,” he said.
<br>
<p>Twin analysis
<br>
<p>The Australian Twin Registry (ATR) is one of the largest twin databases in 
<br>
the world. It is managed by Professor Nick Martin, another author on the 
<br>
paper, and has taken 30 years to build up. It is normally used to study 
<br>
inherited diseases, but evolutionary biologist Dr Owens was the first to 
<br>
suggest that the data could be used to indicate changes in human 
<br>
evolutionary behaviour.
<br>
<p>To calculate whether any of these attributes were genetically inherited, the 
<br>
team analysed lifestyle questionnaires previously gathered by the ATR. The 
<br>
register contains details for 30,000 twins. Of these, 2,710 pairs of 
<br>
identical and non-identical satisfied the criteria for inclusion in the 
<br>
team’s research.
<br>
<p>The data were then assessed using the ‘classical twin method’. This method 
<br>
scores traits on a scale that ranges from wholly genetic through to wholly 
<br>
environmental.
<br>
<p>The researchers placed these scores into special ‘structural models’ on a 
<br>
computer, which allowed a number of different influences to be compared 
<br>
within a rigorous statistical framework. The results revealed any 
<br>
correlations between life history traits and reproductive fitness, removing 
<br>
the effect of social and psychological factors.
