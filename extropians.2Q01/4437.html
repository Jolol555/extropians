From: &quot;Natasha Vita-More&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:natasha@natasha.cc?Subject=Re:%20Emlyn%20on%20the%20teev%20-%20help!&In-Reply-To=&lt;381444716.990125356540.JavaMail.root@web538-wrb&gt;">natasha@natasha.cc</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;&gt;You might consider using percentages:  For example, 25% of Australian
</em><br>
population already has had an augmentation to their bodies.  5% now use
<br>
robotic arms or legs; 10% have received pacemakers; %3 percent IUDs. (There
<br>
are arbitrary, but I think you could get some solid facts which would be
<br>
persuasive in your introduction to augmentations.)&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I read a book called &quot;Communicating Science&quot; which said that this was
</em><br>
actually not so important on TV... TV likes vague generalisations +
<br>
assionate delivery.&lt;
<br>
<p>If you are being interviewd for a TV documentary, they are going to edit.
<br>
Producers and directors perfer crisp explanations over lengthy explanations.
<br>
If they give a topic 3 minutes, for example, they want some alluring and
<br>
exciting information and facts.  They also like sensationalism which can
<br>
later come back to bite you.  I have run into this a number of times where I
<br>
have had to turn down TV programs because they just wanted to exaggerate and
<br>
sensationalize extropians as lovers of metal and dislikers of humanness. 
<br>
This is an issue that we need to think about and consider the consequences
<br>
of overly hyping cyborgdom.
<br>
<p>You have an opportunity to influence a lot of folks and introduce extropian
<br>
ideas -- and your music as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm very good with handwaving and broad brush opinions masquerading as
</em><br>
&quot;Fact&quot;, so I'll probably steer clear of garish numbers as far as possible. A
<br>
nice one is that 10% of americans are cyborgs when you look at drug feed
<br>
implants, pacemakers, articifical joints, articificial skin, etc. It must be
<br>
true, I read it on the web somewhere.&lt;
<br>
<p>Why even consider using garish numbers.  Why not explain how the percentage
<br>
of folks receiving enhancements and augmentations are increasing.  Bring it
<br>
home by explaining that these enhancements are ones that even grandma has.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; HRT is a different augmentation - a chemical augment to monitor female
</em><br>
hormones to prevent the onslaught of menopause.  You could suggest that even
<br>
the mind is augmented by ingesting certain hormones to regulate the
<br>
chemistry of our bodies for a more healthy and vital life.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;HRT is supposed to extend life, though, as a side effect (cool side
</em><br>
effect). Drugs may well count as cyber enhancements too... anyone got an
<br>
opinion on that?&lt;
<br>
<p>HRT is estrogen or combination estrogen/progestin medication. It is
<br>
generally prescribed to relieve menopausal symptoms (such as hot flashes,
<br>
etc., reduce risk of osteoporosis and reduce risk of cardiovascular disease.
<br>
There is some evidence that it may also be useful in preventing Alzheimer's
<br>
disease and colon cancer, but not used for &quot;extending life&quot; per se.
<br>
<p>Male hormone testosterone is also a HRT for men.
<br>
<p>Drugs are definitely enhancements.  We alter our brain chemistry with
<br>
chemicals.  These chemicals have helped millions of people who suffer from
<br>
depression and other more severe mental diseases. Drugs that enhance the
<br>
concentrations neurotransmitters - norepinephrine and/or serotonin at these
<br>
receptors alleviate some symptoms of depression.
<br>
<p>Chemicals for augmenting the brain's chemistry such as dopamine would be
<br>
good to mention.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; How about the man who stared in The X Men?  Isn't he Aussi?
</em><br>
Here you could mention how reversing aging has been on the cover of
<br>
magazines, Time, Newsweek, etc.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I like the bit about it being on the covers of publications, good stuff.&lt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; nose lift = rhinoplasty.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Calling it rhinoplasty... that's just rubbing it in, isn't it? Like calling
</em><br>
permanent hair removal a &quot;Gorillaectomy&quot;, or liposuction a
<br>
&quot;DeElefantation&quot;.&lt;
<br>
<p>Not quite.  It's complimentary to refer to the correct surgical procedure,
<br>
not insulting.  Rhinoplasty is the medical term for nose surgery. Why call
<br>
nanotechnology &quot;computers with small stuff&quot;. Or The Spike a the metal thang.
<br>
:-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, indeed. I'm afraid I can't get too excited about enhancements that
</em><br>
are all about aesthetic stuff... there are just too many important things
<br>
that need doing first. Like getting past dying young, for a start.&lt;
<br>
<p>Why not??  Aesthetics are essential to future technologies. It's a misnomer
<br>
to think asesthics are fluff.  Makes me think of Harvey Newstrom's recent
<br>
post about the mistaken idea that scientists as being overly nerdy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However, I do recognise that money will end up in life extension fields by
</em><br>
way of the beauty industry. Also, I understand that I am a weird geekoid,
<br>
and may not necessarily represent the average citizen :-)&lt;
<br>
<p>And you might be someone who wants to be more appealing to your wife in 40
<br>
years.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;So, you could introduce the idea of enhancing &quot;beauty in the eye of the
</em><br>
beholder&quot; by saying we can tweak our visual recognition patters to highlight
<br>
facial qualities that we like and reduce those that we find unappealiang.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ugly detector... yes, that would be amusing. Also, it raises some
</em><br>
interesting questions. Why bother to look after your physical appearance at
<br>
all, if people will, for the most part, repaint you as they desire in their
<br>
mind's digital eye?&lt;
<br>
<p>Er, not exactly the language I had in mind.  I was thinking more of Sasha's
<br>
&quot;Enhanced Reality&quot; (located at his Web site) or my &quot;Primo 3M+'s&quot; vision
<br>
enhancements:
<br>
<p>&quot;V i s u a l   F i e l d
<br>
Network sonar sensors map data
<br>
_____________
<br>
<p>Infrared/ultraviolet-sensitive high-acuity
<br>
single-photon detecting,
<br>
acceleration-resistant eyeballs.
<br>
<p>Enhanced reality visual overlays through
<br>
retinal implants allow you to
<br>
view information on top of physical objects.
<br>
<p>You can also edit your visual experience,
<br>
removing unsightly objects and morphing
<br>
scenes into images of your choice.
<br>
<p>Sensory input can be patched in through
<br>
global Net connection, allowing
<br>
viewing of remote locations
<br>
from Webcams, space telescopes,
<br>
and flying micro-cameras.
<br>
<p>External visual input gives you
<br>
eyes in the back of your head.
