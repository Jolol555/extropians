<em>&gt; You're right that the Mongol conquest was likely the catalytic event that
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interestingly, a similar phenomenon happened with Islamic culture.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conquest of the Islamic heartland by Ghengis and his progeny also caused a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premature closure of the Islamic world to new ideas from outside and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovation within their own cultural realm.
</em><br>
<p>So in the interests of continuing the ongoing western 
<br>
renaissance/enlightenment (or whatever we want to call it) we better keep an 
<br>
eye out for anything that might cause such a closure. While Mongolian 
<br>
invaders appear unlikely, we might need to look for some culture or group 
<br>
achieving hegemony to such an extent that the dynamism of the enlightenment 
<br>
(which is still driving us, thankfully, despite postmodern confusion) is 
<br>
lost. 
<br>
<p>One such possibility would be a resurgence of the romantic idea complex, now 
<br>
empowered by connections with strong stasist groups. A green corporate 
<br>
technocracy might be very dangerous (sounds a lot like something that might 
<br>
appear in the Alpha Centauri computer game :-) if it could develop. The core 
<br>
of such a complex would be the idea of scarcity, the world as a zero-sum-game 
<br>
and risk aversiveness, perhaps coupled with various essentialist ideas about 
<br>
the natural (and possibly traditional or national) as the good. Another, less 
<br>
likely possibility would be a confucian capitalist China rising to dominance, 
<br>
perhaps subduing the current culture simply by showing an apparently working 
<br>
strong non-enlightenment based system.
<br>
<p>Our historical mission as extropians (sorry, I just wanted to test how it 
<br>
would feel to write that :-) is to make sure such closure scenarios doesn't 
<br>
happen. It can be done in several ways: first, we need to understand this 
<br>
kind of closure better. We might develop technologies making it harder to 
<br>
suppress dissenting or free opinions and ideas. But we should remember that 
<br>
even if you can think freely, if your entire culture (including your own 
<br>
upbringing) regards it is a worthless pursuit, then it will be hard to get 
<br>
any debate or change going. Most likely the best cultural defense is a 
<br>
cultural offense (thanks Natasha :-) both demonstrating the practical and 
<br>
moral value of change, freedom and new directions, as well as hitting the 
<br>
stasist views hard with both subversive alternatives and criticism of their 
<br>
core assumptions. 
<br>
<p>The nature of Monkey was... irrepressible! :-)
