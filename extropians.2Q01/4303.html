<p>&lt;&lt; &quot;As far as the future is concerned, any political or sociological

I read that many years ago when I read Sir Arthur's book, quite avidly.  
<br>
Let's look at Herman Kahn's forecast's when he was involved at the Hudson 
<br>
Institute. I would say the 90% of his forecasts, turned up goose eggs. No 
<br>
cigar, and no home-based nuclear reactors. So what is holding back 
<br>
technological progress? Basically there is development and research money 
<br>
available, not as much as all the companies and universities want; but 
<br>
substantial sums, nevertheless.
<br>
<p>I disagree that it is psychological human inertia. I believe that its simply 
<br>
most companies (World-Wide) tend to focus on rapid return on their capital 
<br>
investments. Regarding this, I have observed last Fridays' USA Today business 
<br>
section, which focused on the fact that many companies are now backing away 
<br>
from being a 'public' company and opting for private corporation, that do not 
<br>
sell stock and IPO's. This seems to be an emerging trend.
<br>
<p>The things that have driven successful technologies, have been profit, wars, 
<br>
international competition, and climatic change, resource depletion 
<br>
(independent of climate) and accidental discoveries. Everyone on this list is 
<br>
well versed in these notions, but we can argue this contention later, if 
<br>
anyone wishes.
<br>
<p>In a way, our technologies have achieved a level of comfortable living. Most 
<br>
of us, who are healthy enough, young enough, can note that most people in our 
<br>
respective countries are fairly contented, at least not driven to the point 
<br>
of demanding actions by the government en masse.' So, this is a quandary, 
<br>
that good living may dissipate the demand for progress.  Ah! But there are 
<br>
some intractable such as disease and aging and death. So we see that the 
<br>
Lion's share goes into medical research, which &quot;may&quot; be slowly paying off, if 
<br>
the new cancer therapy developed seems to indicate:

<p>&lt;&lt;Leukemia Drug Shows Promise Against GIST Tumors
<br>
<p>By Lisa Richwine
<br>

<br>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, (May 13) - Gleevec, the cancer pill approved in record time 
<br>
for its unparalleled power against a type of leukemia, has had success 
<br>
fighting untreatable gastrointestinal tumors, U.S. researchers reported  
<br>
Sunday.
<br>
Made by Swiss drug giant Novartis AG Gleevec was evaluated ...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Nuclear Fusion appears too daunting as a large scale energy source, though 
<br>
the promises keep coming from researchers. I suspect Z-pinch will gather dust 
<br>
as money other fusion concepts have. Solar--always too expensive now, but in 
<br>
5 years...always 5 years. Fuel cells are facing some foot dragging in the 
<br>
market place. 
<br>
Will Kamens' stirling engine really do the trick? Sounds like hype to me.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I guess its a matter of focus and perceived necessity.
