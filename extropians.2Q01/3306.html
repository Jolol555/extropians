<p>I dunno, I never thought cryonics as funny. Sick and creepy maybe,
<br>
but never funny. It helps talking to the people who're doing it
<br>
and watching a video of the procedure. It's still not pretty (unless
<br>
you're the type who's horsing around during practical anatomy lessons 
<br>
as medical student) but it will help adjust your attitude.
<br>
<p>It's a medical procedure. Ridiculously primitive, and often enough
<br>
bungled, and commented with hoots of derision from both the side 
<br>
of the white-frocked angeloform ones as well as the great unwashed 
<br>
masses -- but it's a medical procedure.
<br>
<p>I would rather not see it ridiculed but drained of the snake oil
<br>
covering it with a thick layer, and turned into a *real* medical
<br>
procedure. I'm pretty sure there were people who poked fun at 18th
<br>
century surgeons, who were rather quacks in their way. I doubt it
<br>
was the most constructive attitude, though. You could do a lot better
<br>
by joining the fray, and figuring out what is wrong, or at least
<br>
rewarding the people who're peddling less snake oil.
