<p>I'm certainly NOT qualified to offer a definitive opinion, but I've tried

patience to do it, and that's without trying to stay in once piece

giving it a gentle nudge down was the intention.

<p>My Hypothesis  (Or &quot;Shanghai'ed&quot; Scenario, if you will indulge me:)
<br>
<p>Look at it from the Chinese perspective; You have this aircraft you need to 
<br>
&quot;dissuade&quot; from peeping on you (be it in your airspace or 
<br>
international.  Either way it's close enough to give your leaders the 
<br>
collective willies).  You can't fire on it.  No siree.  Whether in 
<br>
International skies or your own backyard, you fire on it and the other side 
<br>
will see it as an act of aggression, or worse.  While this sort of thing 
<br>
went on in the Cold War, you can't hope to keep that quiet in todays' 
<br>
world.  And even in the bad old days, it was a mostly a matter of 
<br>
&quot;escorting&quot; your &quot;guests&quot; out of your skies.
<br>
<p>So the pilot gets told &quot;Get it down without shooting it down&quot;.  What's left 
<br>
for him to do?  What they did in WWII when the cannon had jammed or you'd 
<br>
just poured your last ammo belt into Jerry.  You give him a not-so-friendly 
<br>
nudge.  Of course in the old days you'd try and wedge your entire crate in 
<br>
the other guys' cockpit, but here it's a delicate &quot;tip&quot;.  However, 
<br>
something goes a amiss.  Either a misjudgement by the jet jockey, or panic 
<br>
by the &quot;visitor&quot;, or turbulence from the jets' wake, and you've got a jet 
<br>
in trouble and an enemy coming down one way or another.
<br>
<p>My guess is the White House, knowing the &quot;facts&quot;, will go along with the 
<br>
&quot;accident&quot; story and instruct the U.S. crew to keep their traps 
<br>
shut.  Telling the world that a Chinese pilot tried to ram them out of the 
<br>
air would leave the White House with an angry nation expecting 
<br>
payback.  And the U.S. Government can't afford to be in a payback mood with 
<br>
the only other real superpower on the planet.
<br>
<p>Any kernel of truth?  Or am I just smoking something?
<br>
<p><p>James...
<br>
<p><p><p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
