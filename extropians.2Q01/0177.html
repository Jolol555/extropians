* &quot;After Australia and England and Wales, the highest prevalence of crime
<br>
was in Holland (25 percent), Sweden (25 percent) and Canada (24
<br>
percent). The United States, despite its high murder rate, was among the
<br>
middle ranking countries with a 21 percent victimization rate,&quot; the
<br>
London Telegraph said.
<br>
<p>Didja see it?  The quick gloss-over disclaimer  'despite its high murder rate&quot;.  The white dog truth and bare bones facts are that the US has far and away the highest peacetime murder rate in the industrialized countries.  The reason?  It is so easy for criminals to get weapons reservd for, and used for, war in most other countries.  For instance, the IRA illegally imports most of the firearms not brought in by British troops there, and they have traditionally killed each other, and their supporters, with them.  If someone was shot here for badmouthing one group or claiming allegiance to another, we would call it gang-related or a hate crime.  The frothing-at-the-mouth rabid bang-bang afficianadoes that inflict and infect this list with their enthralled dogmatic memetic zomboidisms, and try to foist the fear that preventing kids, psychos and criminals from getting their hands on guns by passing required background checks at gun shows and flea markets is a sinister plot by the !
<br>
commie fascist United Nations black helicopter satans, would have you believe that they'd rather take a bullet to the head or heart, or give one, than risk a broken nose in a bout of fisticuffs.  That is because the terminally chickenshit pencil-necked geeks among them are afraid of tangling with what they perceive to be the adult counterpart of the schoolhouse bullies who knocked their science books out of their hands and broke their precious glasses, and look to guns as the great equalizer, because they viciously hate those childhood bullies with a white-hot resentment born of remembered indignities endured, and desperately want to kill them, or anyone they can convince themselves is remotely like them, oh yes, they do.  But guns aren't an equalizer in the real world; only in some chivalrous mental fantasy land where everyone plays by the Marquis of Queensbury rules and doesn't backshoot, or pull down first, which criminals are quite prepared, even thrilled, to do.  They won!
<br>
't wait like considerate gentlemen while you adjust your fedora, spit out your tiny cigar, squint with one eye, and flip the flap of your jacket away from your holster so's y'all can draw fair-n-square like in the moooveeez; oh, nnnOOOO!  They're sociopaths; they'll just blow your frigging brains out, without warning or regret, in a heartbeat (your last) or a New York second (also your last), especially if they perceive you to be a threat in any way, shape, form or fashion, if you have something they want.  You're just an obstacle to their attaining it by any means necessary, and the fact that you may be armed is just another variable to be considered and accounted for, which means you'll be murdered instead of mugged, and most likely won't even get the chance to see the predator or hear the shot (why should they take any chances with you?).  In order to even the playing field again - guess what? - you have to become a criminal, too; but perhaps that's the subtextual sublimina!
<br>
&nbsp;in all the anti-government vigilante bullus shittus that these pitiful and pathetic bravado-junkies interminably spout.  They're covert outlaw wannabes, without even the cohones to admit same to themselves, much less anyone else; but get a pack of them together, and that sick, twisted and demented desire to hunt humans they have conveniently defined as sub for conscience-salving purposes is tacitly understood between them.  And not even for money, like a self-respecting criminal, but for fun; the perverts get off on even the thought of it.  It may be the only way they've found to open to boost their testosterone production, considering the likely lack of females willing to help snarling geeks with such things.
