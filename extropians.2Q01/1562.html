<p>OK, why would we use handcoded assembly language? I think there is a flaw in
<br>
the implicit reasoning about this stuff... you are using the analogy of the
<br>
early days of computing, when everything about computers was minimal except
<br>
for the price tag.
<br>
<p>The difference with early nanotech is that it will occur in an environment
<br>
of *massive* computing power. Utterly incredible computing power (Hey, that
<br>
could be right now).
<br>
<p>So your nanobots may be severely constrained in number of instructions,
<br>
amount of memory, and maybe processing speed?
<br>
<p>So, what you do is to build a simulation of the nanobots + environment, in a
<br>
very powerful computing environment (use a couple of blue-genes that are
<br>
lying around?), and develop a high level language in which you can write the
<br>
code for your bots. The high level language can be run in the sim directly
<br>
as if it were running on the nanobot, and used to control the bot.
<br>
<p>The high level language is first compiled to BotOpCode, and optimised using
<br>
standard techniques. This is probably still a bit bloated (I imagine this
<br>
would be your conjecture, and the reason that you have said we'd be using
<br>
assembler).
<br>
<p>Next, you build a genetic programming environment with which to create your
<br>
tight machine code. You use your bloated compilation result as the initial
<br>
gene set (probably with a few variations, optimised code, unoptimised code,
<br>
randome sequences, anything else to fill out the population).
<br>
<p>You use the simulation on one super fast machine as the fitness function.
<br>
Each gene set (a program) can be run in the sim, and rated as to how closely
<br>
it conforms to the operation of the original high-level language program.
<br>
This gives a rating of fitness. Also combined into the fitness rating is the
<br>
length of the machine code, and the amount of resources the program requires
<br>
to run; the smaller, the better. Probably, you wouldn't allow a program that
<br>
doesn't conform tightly to the behaviour of the sim to have a fitness better
<br>
than a certain level, so that only correct programs would get a better
<br>
fitness; above that level, optimisation requirements would be the
<br>
determinant.
<br>
<p>Then, you use some kind of sexual recombination to mix up the programs and
<br>
promote them to the next round, dependent on the fitness results (how they
<br>
did in the sim). You might pop in some mutation if you think there's not
<br>
enough variation in the original gene pool, but that's mostly optional.
<br>
<p>Lather, rinse, repeat. By this method, you should evolve very tight,
<br>
resource friendly routines. Of course, you only accept a result that has a
<br>
fitness above the correctness threshold, as specified above.
<br>
<p>There have been some excellent results in this area - I remember reading
<br>
that the tightest bubblesort algorithm (was it bubblesort?) ever written had
<br>
61 instructions, and that a machine had evolved a version with 62 operations
<br>
&nbsp;using the a method similar to that described above.
<br>
<p>I bet that, if you had a few good generic sim packages around the traps, so
<br>
nanobot architects could sim their creations without coding the sim from
<br>
scratch, then you would be able to evolve tight code a *lot* more quickly
<br>
than a super coder could write it.
<br>
<p><pre>
--
<p>I bring all this up, because I don't think that human coding time is getting
any cheaper, or that the doing of it is getting any faster... and to cut
assembly language for early nanobots, you are going to need to be a really
good coder. To do it quickly, you'd need to be a god. Set against a backdrop
of highly available cheap powerful computing, and very good sim and
evolutionary techniques (how, after all, do we get to nanobots in the first
place?), it seems odd that handcoded assembly would be the standard in
botcode.
