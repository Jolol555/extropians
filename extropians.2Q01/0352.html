<em>&gt; Apropos drives, could a Nerva nuclear engine be converted into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stationary reactor for power production?
</em><br>
<p>In principle, yes. A Dumbo drive is probably another matter. Are you
<br>
familiar with that design?
<br>
Antimatter-catalyzed fission does look good, too. I hadn't heard of it
<br>
prior to this thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And be sure to include space rot for facilities/equipment that stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; operational long enough. You have probably heard about the space plaque
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (mold+bacteria colonies on Mir's exterior, that eat quartz and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; titanium--not the plaque on Voyager...)? I am wondering if the damage is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exacerbated by free singlet oxygen (prevalent at those altitudes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; IIRC)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have definite plans for introducing the wonders of accidental space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ecology in the game. One of the things they will need to get working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a small ecosystem to supplement their food and recycle waste. Space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; molds might be more dangerous than meteors to the mission.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I have not heard anything about any colonies on Mir's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *exterior*. That sounds rather unlikely, especially if they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eating low-energy stuff like quartz.
</em><br>
<p>See my reply to Spike. The impression I had was that the quartz etc. was
<br>
getting corroded by organic acids (think of lichen), and that the
<br>
sustenance was from dandruff and urine dump residue, etc. However, I
<br>
don't find any good source for the &quot;outside&quot; stuff. Too bad, sort of.
