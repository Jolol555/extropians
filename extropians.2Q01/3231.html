Subject: US lawmakers introduce bill to ban all forms of human cloning
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON, April 26 (AFP) - US lawmakers on Thursday introduced  
<br>
a bill to ban all forms of human cloning including &quot;therapeutic 
<br>
cloning&quot; used in embryonic stem cell research. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 goes one step further  
<br>
than legislation introduced earlier this month by a senator that 
<br>
would ban &quot;reproductive cloning,&quot; or allowing the birth of a cloned 
<br>
human. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Efforts to create human beings by cloning mark a new and  
<br>
decisive step toward turning human reproduction into a manufacturing 
<br>
process,&quot; said Kansas Senator Sam Brownback in introducing the 
<br>
measure. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for cloning to develop stem cells, Brownback said the  
<br>
prospect of &quot;creating new human life solely to be exploited and 
<br>
destroyed in this way has been condemned on moral grounds by many as 
<br>
displaying a profound disrespect for human life.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, backed by Representative Dave Weldon of Florida, would  
<br>
make human cloning a federal criminal offense punishable by up to 10 
<br>
years imprisonment and a fine of not less than one million dollars. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measure would include a ban on the importation of cloned  
<br>
products. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both lawmakers argued that stem research could continue using  
<br>
stem cells from adult tissues, placentas and so on. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Other scientific research, using cloning techniques to produce  
<br>
molecules, DNA, cells other than human embryos, tissues, organs, 
<br>
plants, or animals other than humans, is explicitly permitted,&quot; 
<br>
explained a fact sheet on the bill produced by the National 
<br>
Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weldon and Brownback said they felt the bill had a good chance  
<br>
of passing both the House and Senate, pointing out that a recent 
<br>
Time/CNN poll showed 90 percent of Americans said it was &quot;a bad 
<br>
idea&quot; to clone human beings. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If approved, the bill would then go to President George W. Bush,  
<br>
who has come out against human cloning, to be signed into law. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 5, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell introduced a bill  
<br>
that would ban human cloning and urged members the House of 
<br>
Representatives to follow suit. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His proposal would ban all attempts to clone a human being  
<br>
regardless of whether this effort is financed with government or 
<br>
private funds. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, the administration of former president Bill Clinton  
<br>
declared a five-year moratorium on human cloning financed by 
<br>
government funds, but at the moment, nothing prevents a 
<br>
privately-financed experiment. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous attempts to pass legislation banning human cloning have  
<br>
been unsuccessful. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proponents of human cloning include Panos Zavos, a naturalized  
<br>
American and  former professor of reproductive psychology at the 
<br>
University of Kentucky who is a member of a private consortium 
<br>
working on human cloning. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Clonaid, a firm founded by the Raelians, a  
<br>
religious sect, has announced plans to clone a 10-month-old dead 
<br>
baby. 
<br>
