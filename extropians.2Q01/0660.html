<p>It varies a lot with the amino-acid.  I think proline and
<br>
cysteine would be good examples of amino acids that you
<br>
can't substitute without breaking things (proline is I
<br>
think essential at certain 2D folds in the protein chain
<br>
and cysteine is essential for forming di-sulfide bonds that
<br>
hold the final 3D structure more rigidly).  However many of
<br>
the hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acids (which probably
<br>
serve to drive local-folding rates) can probably be substituted
<br>
without having too much of an effect on the end result.
<br>
There are always a few amino acids in the enzyme catalytic
<br>
sites or determining the size of an ion pore for example,
<br>
that you absolutely cannot substitute without significantly
<br>
damaging or even breaking the function.
<br>
<p>I don't know whether or not we know how sensitive changes
<br>
would be from a global perspective.  Eugene might have a better
<br>
idea than I.  One thing that I do know is that most of
<br>
the current structures are probably sub-optimal.  We can
<br>
improve things a lot with some &quot;conscious&quot; engineering.
