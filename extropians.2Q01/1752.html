<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think that godhood is relative matter:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If we were to create a simulation of other universe in computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we would satisfy the requirements for your 'Type I God'. We have ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to chance laws of our simulation but we were still restricted by the
</em><br>
laws
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of our universe. 'Type II Gods' can exist then, absolute power is
</em><br>
another
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But would 'Type III God' be possible and would that need &quot;alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mathematics'? Perhaps you philosophers know can such a thing exist and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what would it be? A set of theorems impossible to prove with theorems
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; another set?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Being the religiously mathematical mathematician that I am, I simply don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy the possibility of existence of a Type III God. That's one of the main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons I am pronouncedly not a Christian.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The thing is, that in a system -- where the laws of logic as well as a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting points are taken to be axiomatic -- such as mathematics, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility of violating the laws of the system simply is not there within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the system. And stepping out of the system is just that -- and it's simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to violate the laws of a system while not in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could elaborate and make it clearer what I'm talking about --- but not
</em><br>
at
<br>
<em>&gt; this time of day...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I have a hard time with this stuff no matter what the time of day--and about
<br>
half my thesis is on this, i.e., on the philosophical foundations of logic.
<br>
To my mind, the question is not whether we can understand violations of our
<br>
most cherished logical laws, but whether we could verify this is the case.
<br>
Here is an analogy: A child of 4 is told by her loving physicist mother that
<br>
E=Mcc. The child has good evidence that this is true--mum wouldn't lie about
<br>
this--but she cannot comprehend the meaning of this statement. Does the
<br>
child know that E=Mcc even though she cannot understand what the statement
<br>
means? If you answer yes, the question then is could we be in the same
<br>
relation to a God III. A rationalistic response is to say no, because we
<br>
cannot verify statements that we cannot understand. Fideism allows the
<br>
possibility that we are in exactly the same position as the child, that we
<br>
could trust a God III who said: &quot;hey you humans, your logic is wrong, but
<br>
then again, that is understandable, you were built that way. The fact that
<br>
you cannot understand this is no more telling than the fact that a child
<br>
can't understand relativity theory.&quot; To the rationalist, the fideist looks
<br>
irrational placing so much evidence on interpersonal trust. To the fideist,
<br>
the rationalist looks inconsistent because asserting the supremacy of human
<br>
reason can itself only be a matter of trust. Could we build a God III that
<br>
we could not understand but who we could trust? I leave that as a homework
<br>
assignment. Mark and Not-Mark.
