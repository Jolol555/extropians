If anyone really wants to volunteer their services to seed AI,
<br>
and is impatient for a set of marching orders, they always
<br>
have the option of setting out on their own. In my opinion,
<br>
the more people who do that the better, because the people who
<br>
do that have to think about how the task-as-a-whole might be
<br>
accomplished, and so they'll be better equipped to contribute
<br>
if and when a seed-AI *team* does get off the ground.
<br>
<p>And if you need a blueprint to get started, CaTAI exists,
<br>
even if the specs for Flare do not. I would urge the people
<br>
who are keen to code *now* to think of a functional subsystem
<br>
(i.e. a module) that a seed AI would have to have, and try
<br>
to code such a subsystem, in the language of their choice.
<br>
I don't see how the effort could be a waste, no matter what
<br>
happens.
