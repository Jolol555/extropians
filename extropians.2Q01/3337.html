<p>By BBC News Online science editor Dr David Whitehouse 
<br>
Astronomers say that a game of planetary survival is taking place inside a 
<br>
gigantic cloud of gas and dust 1,500 light-years from Earth. 
<br>
<p>It could mean that planets may be rarer in the Galaxy than previously 
<br>
thought. 
<br>
<p>The dramatic events are taking place in the Orion Nebula - the nearest, large 
<br>
stellar nursery to Earth. 
<br>
<p>The observations suggest that any fledgling planets must try to form quickly, 
<br>
or they will be destroyed by a flood of radiation from the nebula's brightest 
<br>
star. 
<br>
<p><p><p>Planets around young stars may have to form quickly....
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In research published in Science magazine, John Bally of the University of 
<br>
Colorado in Boulder, US, and Henry Throop of the Southwest Research 
<br>
Institute, also in Boulder, used Hubble to see if planets were beginning to 
<br>
grow in million-year-old dusty discs that surround young stars in Orion. 
<br>
<p>First steps 
<br>
<p>&quot;This is the first time that large-growing dust grains, which range in size 
<br>
from smoke particles to sand grains, have been seen in visible light in these 
<br>
protoplanetary discs,&quot; Throop said. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The dust we're seeing in the Hubble observations is large, completely unlike 
<br>
dust that we've seen in young star-forming regions like this before. We're 
<br>
seeing the very first stages of planetary formation happening before our 
<br>
eyes.&quot; 
<br>
<p><p><p>..or else they could be destroyed.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;We have two things happening in these systems: dust grains are beginning to 
<br>
stick together as a first step towards making planets, but then bright stars 
<br>
are trying to tear everything apart. Which one wins is really a big question. 
<br>
It's like trying to build a skyscraper in the middle of a tornado.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The astronomers deduced the dust size from the way the discs allow light to 
<br>
pass through them. The fine dust normally seen in space scatters blue light 
<br>
but allows red light to pass through. The Sun appears red at sunset because 
<br>
atmospheric dust influences light in the same way as space dust. 
<br>
<p>The dust discs in Orion appear grey because they allow all colours of light 
<br>
to pass through. This is because the dust is much larger than interstellar 
<br>
dust. 
<br>
<p>Radio observations also provide tantalising hints that much of the material 
<br>
in the disc may range in size from snowflakes to gravel. 
<br>
<p>Hostile environment 
<br>
<p>The Hubble observations show that it may be easy to start building planets. 
<br>
According to conventional theory, the grains will clump under gravity, until 
<br>
they become the size of planets. 
<br>
<p>Astronomers suggest that nurturing planets to maturity may be a dicey drama 
<br>
repeatedly playing out deep inside star-forming clouds scattered across our 
<br>
Galaxy. 
<br>
<p>Because of Orion's hostile environment, typical of star-forming regions, 
<br>
&quot;we're also seeing that planet formation is a hazardous process,&quot; Bally says. 
<br>
<p>The outcome could have far-reaching implications for the number of planets in 
<br>
our Galaxy. 
<br>
<p>Depending on whether planets can form quickly or not, it could mean that 
<br>
planets may be rarer in the Galaxy than previously thought. 
<br>
<p>Astronomers point out this is consistent with extra-solar planet discoveries 
<br>
so far. They show that about 5% of the stars in our solar neighbourhood have 
<br>
Jupiter-sized planets in small orbits. 
<br>
<p>If giant planets like Jupiter could collapse quickly out of the gas disc, 
<br>
they might survive, according to a theory proposed by Alan Boss of Carnegie 
<br>
Institutions, Washington. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Only time will tell. If we find lots of 'Jupiters' around other stars, then 
<br>
it means they will have managed to grow rapidly in Orion-type environments,&quot; 
<br>
Boss says. 
<br>
<p>Throop agrees: &quot;It looks like 'Jupiters' must be formed either rarely or 
<br>
rapidly. It's a good bet that planetary systems in Orion will look nothing 
<br>
like our own Solar System. Although they may have rocky planets like Earth 
<br>
and Mars, it looks hard to form either giant
