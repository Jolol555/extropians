Another angle on the Pascal's Wager vs. Cryonics problem is what I call 
<br>
&quot;fixity of likelihood&quot;.  Basically, god (whichever of the 1000's referred 
<br>
to) will be no more likely to exist tomorrow as it/he/she was 
<br>
yesterday.  The likelihood of god existing is unchanging.
<br>
<p>Cryonics (or more accurately, reversal of present day cryopreservation) 
<br>
doesn't have &quot;fixed likelihood&quot;.  The likelihood of success increases over 
<br>
time.  While god will be no more likely to exist or not in 100 years' time, 
<br>
the likelihood of successful cryo-recovery will be much increased or a 
<br>
certainty at that time, given continued research efforts of course.
<br>
<p>It's a bet between a claimed supernatural being and continued advancement 
<br>
by humans.  Ask him, as an atheist, which one he thinks is more likely to 
<br>
pan out.

&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
