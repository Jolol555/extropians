<p><em>&gt; Robert, we desperately need a leader with vision.
</em><br>
<p>Here is how I would &quot;direct&quot; (at the risk of annoying everyone)...
<br>
<p>Excel spreadsheets are to me &quot;open source&quot;.  Spike and I
<br>
share them without any problems.  That they run on &quot;closed
<br>
source&quot; Excel doesn't matter.  Excel runs on closed source
<br>
hardware which runs on a closed source universe.
<br>
<p>Should you try to increase the number of platforms on which
<br>
things run?  Yes.  [Go look at my CV and see the number of
<br>
platforms I've worked on.]
<br>
<p>So Excel spreadsheets can run with the open-source Excel
<br>
equivalents.  The only problem is I do not know how
<br>
&quot;equivalent&quot; these are.  What features of Excel cannot
<br>
be used in the alternate open source emulators?  [If its
<br>
as small fraction then we try to keep the spreadsheets
<br>
from using those features, but we will need to document them.]
<br>
<p>Now, Mike is web-interfacing Spike's sheets.  That is great.
<br>
But will his approach work on the open-source excel equivalents?
<br>
If it will not, then I would suggest that it may be useful for us
<br>
all to up-educate ourselves to the more open source, portable
<br>
tools (Python, etc.).
<br>
<p>While I appreciate and agree with Eugene's perspective, I have
<br>
to be pragmatic that the people on the list have limited time
<br>
to dedicate to sharing their work.  Many things shared running in
<br>
a not insignificant number of locations is worth more than very
<br>
few things shared running everywhere.
<br>
<p>I don't learn Russian to talk to Russian scientists -- Following
<br>
that principle I would have to learn a dozen languages to talk
<br>
to dozens of scientists.  I say &quot;if you want to work with me, you
<br>
have to learn some method of communicating with me&quot;.  Following
<br>
this principle, you don't require the creators of the apps
<br>
to learn whole new languages to implement the apps.  Let them
<br>
implement the apps (with documentation!!!) in what they know.
<br>
Its then its up to others to adapt those apps to more open
<br>
environments if the need is there and the multi-environmental
<br>
individuals who can do this are interested.
<br>
<p>Remember the standard programming axioms -- the first version
<br>
is always a prototype.  If its useful enough to make derivative
<br>
versions, *then* you think about how to reach the greatest audience
<br>
with those versions.
<br>
<p>Really, how many people on the list want to do rocket optimization
<br>
experiments?  5?  Do any of them not have access to Excel?  Unlikely.
<br>
<p>The bottom line is this -- Open source is great from some perspectives.
<br>
It isn't great from others.  For example I have the source to my
<br>
email program &quot;Pine&quot;.  Can I get it to correctly sort my inbox?
<br>
No.  Why?  Because when you encode the sorting rules of the type
<br>
I require it corrupts the messages.  Do I have the knowledge to
<br>
debug and fix this?  Yes.  Do most people? No.  Have I fixed it?
<br>
No.  Why?  Because I've looked at it, added debug statements and
<br>
come to the conclusion that whatever it is doing wrong might require
<br>
several days to fix.  It simply isn't worth my time.
<br>
<p>Is a situation in which companies that have millions of paying customers
<br>
who encounter closed-source bugs and report them better or worse
<br>
than a situation in there are open-source programs that were developed
<br>
ages ago as a &quot;public-service&quot; but are now are essentially unsupported?
<br>
<p>Eric Raymond is correct -- in the shadow of many eyes all bugs
<br>
are shallow.  The very important question is *how many eyes*
<br>
(with sufficient wisdom behind them) are looking at the bugs?
<br>
<p>While I have no love for Microsoft (Windows '95 &amp; '98 are jokes)
<br>
and NT I can regularly bring to its knees (open up 60-80 Netscape
<br>
or IE windows), Linux is no better -- no journaling file system
<br>
(until recently), no &quot;raw&quot; devices (like the operating system's
<br>
&quot;read-ahead&quot; strategy is optimal for databases).  BSD is better
<br>
because it is &quot;real&quot; UNIX and open source, but the *best* UNIX
<br>
is that that went from AT&amp;T to Novell to SCO, which was closed
<br>
source, was a much better engineered system (at least while Bell Labs
<br>
still drove the cart).  Novell Netware too was a much better server
<br>
in its heyday, despite its closed source, because the original
<br>
developers *knew* how to engineer an efficient system. 
<br>
<p>There are examples of open source software that is very very good,
<br>
such as Perl.  I'd argue however that probably 60-80% of the open source
<br>
software out there is caca.  I'll base that on the simple perspective
<br>
that there are not that many *really* good software engineers.
<br>
