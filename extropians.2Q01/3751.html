Eliezer S. Yudkowsky, &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20How%20You%20Do%20Not%20Tell%20the%20Truth&In-Reply-To=&lt;200105040118.SAA26689@finney.org&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;, writes:
<br>
<em>&gt; Essentially, Robin's paper gives a rigorous mathematical proof that for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two people to (a) disagree and (b) maintain their disagreement after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction, one or both of the parties must believe that they are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be rational than the other person.
</em><br>
<p>Do they have to assume that the other part is *not* rational, or is it
<br>
enough that the other party is *less* rational than them?  (The first,
<br>
right?)
<br>
<p>And by rational, you mean to be a Bayesian truth-seeking truth-teller?
<br>
<p>Robin describes it as, &quot;Thus the decision to disagree with someone
<br>
depends crucially on an estimate that one is more  meta-rational,  i.e.,
<br>
that one is more likely to be a truth-seeker with a rational core who
<br>
understands the irrationality of disagreement.&quot;
<br>
<p>This suggests that being a Bayesian truth-seeker is not enough, it
<br>
is also necessary to understand the irrationality of disagreement.
<br>
Of course, since Bayesians draw all correct conclusions from existing
<br>
data, they have full, implicit knowledge of all of mathematics and hence
<br>
were completely aware of this result long before Aumann published.
<br>
<p><p>One thing which is unclear in the paper is how you should react if you
<br>
become convinced that both you and the other party are both rational
<br>
and fully informed about these results.  (Or, if it seems unreasonable
<br>
to suppose that any human beings can reach this state, consider it a
<br>
hypothetical question to ask how true Bayesians would interact.)  As a
<br>
practical matter, what means do you apply to resolve your disagreement?
<br>
<p>Obviously one of you has a more informed opinion, which is the ultimate
<br>
cause of the disagreement.  You share common priors, but you have
<br>
different information (some of which is genetic and not accessible to
<br>
your conscious mind).  How do you determine which view is more accurate?
<br>
<p>The issue is especially difficult because the theorem not only requires
<br>
agreement to be reached eventually, but also constrains the path which
<br>
must be followed: &quot;Even though agreement may eventually be reached,
<br>
rationality is still violated if John and Mary are able to predict
<br>
differences of opinions early in the discussion.&quot;  Seemingly this would
<br>
mean that if Bayesians John and Mary gradually move closer to an eventual
<br>
compromise that they agree upon, this violates the theorem because they
<br>
could have predicted this path.  Yet it seems obvious that something
<br>
like this must be how agreement is reached.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a 100,000:1 genius is interacting with a 10,000,000:1 genius, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither of them knows the other's percentile, both will rationally assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they are more likely to be rational than the other person.  However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robin's paper does prove that in *most* cases, rather than in the rarer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instances where two geniuses unknowingly interact, people must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overestimating their own rationality relative to others, or else must not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be using rigorous Bayesian reasoning with respect to what they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; licensed to conclude from their own thoughts.
</em><br>
<p>It seems that if both parties clearly explain their understanding about
<br>
this paradoxical result, each would be forced to accept that the other
<br>
had made at least a prima facie case for being rational enough for the
<br>
result to apply.  They should then feel mutually bound to reach agreement.
