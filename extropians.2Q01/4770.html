LigoCyte has developed a synthetically engirneered virus-sized particle,
<br>
consisting of a polymerized liposome on which antigens can be presented and
<br>
oriented and used for adhesion, targeting and to provoke an immune response.
<br>
A schematic reapresentation of this nanotechnology is available at
<br>
<a href="http://ligocyte.com/nanoX.html">http://ligocyte.com/nanoX.html</a>
<br>
The nanoparticle assemblies are superior to other platforms for several
<br>
reasons: 1) the spherical assemblies are easy to synthesize and very stable;
<br>
2) the structures are fairly rigid, not suffering from folding uncertainties
<br>
associated with soluble linear or branched chain polymers; 3) unlike
<br>
conventional bilayer liposomes, they are inert with regard to random fusion
<br>
with themselves or other membranes; 4) the surface character, in terms of
<br>
charge and molecular makeup, is easily varied because the polymer backbone
<br>
tolerates nearly any appended molecule in a wide range of ratios.
<br>
LigoCyte is aggressively developing the nanoparticle delivery platform for use
<br>
in the areas of anti-inflammatories and anti-infectives. Inhibition of
<br>
lymphocyte binding has already been demonstrated with remarkable avidity. Work
<br>
is in progress to assemble new ligands designed to inhibit adhesion of
<br>
pathogens to cells and to bind to pathogen-derived toxins for anti-viral,
<br>
anti-bacterial or anti-fungal applications. The LigoCyte nanoparticles are
<br>
even capable of functioning as macromolecule assemblies of antigens for
<br>
effective vaccine development, allowing the inclusion of targeting molecules
<br>
(like LigoCyte's M cell targeting protein) into the array of surface ligands.

<p>&quot;Man is an abstraction. Human abstractions are based on the past, on behavior,
<br>
not on operant considerations of what is happening. Considerations of the
<br>
present? Patterns. Transaction. Activity. Doing. Considerations of the past?
<br>
Behavior. Environment. Man.&quot;
