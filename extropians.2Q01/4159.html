</em><br>
<p>Of course, the whole point of Wright's book is that, while events
<br>
such as the Ming turn toward isolationism may have sucked for the Chinese,
<br>
they don't make a dent in the envelope of cultural evolution -- in the
<br>
case of China's abandonment of progress, it just meant that the locus of activity
<br>
representing the leading edge of the envelope shifted elsewhere (to western Europe).
<br>
<p>Wright's position is, of course, an **extremely** controversial one.
<br>
Most mainstream historians (so I've heard) still react to the idea that
<br>
history has a &quot;direction&quot; the same way that Stephen Jay Gould reacts
<br>
to the suggestion that evolution has a direction -- with an intimidating,
<br>
loud, and dismissive snort.  But the whole notion of exponential technological
<br>
progress leading to the Singularity, of which Ray Kurzweil seems now to have
<br>
emerged as the most publicly-visible exponent and champion, is simply
<br>
an intensification of this idea of &quot;directed history&quot; as described by Wright
<br>
in _Nonzero_.
<br>
<p>However, the notion that no one polity or government has the power
<br>
to halt the global trend has also appeared in responses to Bill Joy's
<br>
call for &quot;relinquishment&quot; -- if it doesn't happen here, or in the
<br>
open, that just means it'll happen elsewhere, or in secret.  This view
<br>
appears, for example, in Eliezer's remark &quot;Maybe refusing to develop AI today
<br>
sounds vaguely plausible, but are you really going to keep the moratorium
<br>
going for a thousand years? For a million years? ... The possibility of
<br>
superintelligence seems to be practically built into the structure of the
<br>
Universe as something that we have to confront eventually.&quot; (in &quot;The Path to
<br>
Survival&quot;, on the Web page of responses to Bill Joy at
