I'm sorry I don't have time to organize my thoughts better, but let me
<br>
note that although the Brownian computer is not the only possible model
<br>
of reversible computing, it does work in principle (and some biological
<br>
processing of DNA can be modelled rather well as a reversible Brownian
<br>
computation).
<br>
<p>Hence the puzzles that I posed regarding the nature of conscious
<br>
experience on such a computer (which may step backwards as well as
<br>
forwards) are still valid and must be addressed.  After all it is possible
<br>
that our universe is being simulated on such a computer right now.  Do we
<br>
notice?  Maybe you un-read and re-read this message half a dozen times.
<br>
What impact would this have on our experience of the universe?
<br>
<p>Some people on Wei Dai's everything-list propose that each possible
<br>
observer-moment (for all possible conscious observers) makes up a set
<br>
and that we randomly experience observer-moments chosen from that set.
<br>
Hence we are more likely to experience observer-moments with a larger
<br>
measure.  The regularity of the universe is explained by the fact that
<br>
the programs to generate lawful observer-moments similar to what we
<br>
see are much shorter and hence more probable than programs which would
<br>
generate random, chaotic observer-moments.
<br>
<p>A consequence of this view is that observer-moments which execute
<br>
more often would be more probable.  Hence we are more likely to be
<br>
experiencing observer moments that have been executed multiple times.
<br>
This might suggest that Brownian implementations would be preferred and
<br>
make it more likely than not that we are running on a Brownian computer.
<br>
<p>(Wei Dai suggested that another consequence is that observer-moments
<br>
running on large computers would have larger measure than those running on
<br>
small computers.  This addresses the paradox that running a calculation
<br>
multiple times in parallel can be the same as running the calculation
<br>
a single time on a larger computer.)
