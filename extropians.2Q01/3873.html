<em>&gt; In any case, I think that a Turing machine would be just

</em><br>
<em>&gt; un-calculation is exactly what would transpire if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrow of time were reversed;  but the direction of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrow of time is symmetrical (i.e., there's no place to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stand and claim that it's going now one way, and now the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other).  So un-experiencing something would be just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fun as experiencing it... not &quot;un-fun&quot; at all!
</em><br>
<p>It's a good question, and I think this is an excellent thought experiment
<br>
for shedding light on the matter.  This is an example of what I was
<br>
getting at earlier when I suggested that it doesn't always make sense
<br>
to ask where and when consciousness is occuring.
<br>
<p>A reversible computer is as likely to take a step backwards as forwards.
<br>
So even if it manages to complete a calculation from A to B, the process
<br>
will be a random walk, moving forward and backwards many times over each
<br>
portion of the path from A to B.
<br>
<p>Now if we interpret each step of the computer as instantiating a little
<br>
bubble of conscious experience, then the consciousness will move forward
<br>
and backwards in time just like the computer.  You'll think thought 1,
<br>
then thought 2, then you'll think thought 2 backwards, then forwards
<br>
again, then thought 3, then thought 3 backwards, 2 backwards, 1 backwards,
<br>
1 forwards, and so on.
<br>
<p>However of course the conscious mind is not aware of this.  The structure
<br>
of the computer is such that it would have no memory of having gone back
<br>
and forth like this.  In the end when it thinks back over what happened,
<br>
it will remember thought 1, then 2, then 3, and so on, straight on to
<br>
the end.
<br>
<p>So there is a real disconnect in this case between what we hypothesize
<br>
happening from a functional perspective, and what we have evidence for
<br>
happening based on the reports of the conscious mind.  All we truly
<br>
have evidence for is that the computation did exist, did complete.
<br>
We don't know whether the mind really experienced going backwards and
<br>
forwards like that.
<br>
<p>And we especially don't know what form the consciousness took during
<br>
the reverse steps.  What does it feel like to have memories erased
<br>
rather than stored?  There is no way to ask a person and find out
<br>
(that I can see).  Certainly if you ask them after a step is reversed,
<br>
the answer will obviously be the same as if the step never occured.
<br>
<p>I posted an article several years ago [1] about an actual machine which
<br>
raised a somewhat similar question about what happens to consciousness
<br>
if the machine can't remember certain kinds of transformations.  But I
<br>
think Lee's example is even more pointed.
