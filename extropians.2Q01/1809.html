<p>Well put.  This is one of those differences that does *not* make a difference.
<br>
Many times over the years I have had to remind my digital design engineers that
<br>
the circuits they are creating just look digital within a bounded set of
<br>
circumstances, and that without careful controls, the manufacturing guys can
<br>
screw up those circumstances.  Then I have also had to remind my linear circuit
<br>
designers that electrons can cross transistors one at a time, and that very small
<br>
signals will be mixed with shot noise that is a random quantum effect.  All of
<br>
circuit theory is a special case of Maxwell's equations, and my physicist friends
<br>
keep reminding me that those equations only hold on a scale big enough to save me
<br>
from sitting there summing Feynman diagrams.
<br>
<p>Another problem is that most people assume that analog equals continuous.  This
<br>
is not necessarily true (Eugene pointed out that we have yet to find a way to
<br>
make it true).  I can have a system that represents, say LP grove width, with an
<br>
analog signal having discreet allowable voltage levels.  When the grove gets
<br>
wider, the voltage gets higher; just because it does it in steps (quantized) does
<br>
not mean it is digital.  If it did, we would have to argue at what step size do
<br>
you cross the line.  If I connect two such quantized analog signals into a
<br>
multiplying amplifier, it will still give me a quantized analog output, but it
<br>
may have to make some internal roundoff decisions that are of a digital nature if
<br>
it does not have the dynamic range to preserve all the information.
<br>
<p>Contrast the example above with a device that is more clearly on the digital
<br>
side.  Here I read a stream of ones and zeros that encode a signal level.  As the
<br>
signal becomes stronger and weaker, the pattern of ones and zeros changes, but
<br>
one or zero voltage levels do not.  If I want to multiply two of these values
<br>
together, I can send the patterns to a digital device that may make the same
<br>
roundoff decisions as above, but in this case, it could also expand the length of
<br>
the patterns, and preserve all the information (presuming I can trade off time or
<br>
have a means to increase bandwidth).
<br>
<p>Likewise, digital does not necessarily mean mathematically perfect.  If a chip
<br>
salesman came to me and tried to sell me gates that only gave the mathematically
<br>
correct result %75 of the time, I would show him the way to door, but if on the
<br>
way to the door, he told me that they were cheap and 1000 times faster than any
<br>
other, I would stop and get out my check book.  It is well known that reliable
<br>
systems can be made out of unreliable parts, which starts to make them look like
<br>
systems of analog stuff again.
<br>
<p>F. Dyson's argument about having plenty of effectively continuous state levels
<br>
near the end of the Universe doesn't do much for me because (1) I do not believe
<br>
any projections past Singularity and (2) he has to let his system get arbitrarily
<br>
large to get the states, which means that speed of light restrictions would cause
<br>
computation to grind to a virtual halt anyway.  As to the noncomputable numbers
<br>
argument, if the result of solving some equation is Pi, Macsyma or Mathematica is
<br>
going to tell me the answer is Pi, or give me an infinite series to sum for it.
<br>
Works for me.
<br>
<p>The main point is that the analog/digital difference only makes a difference in
<br>
special cases, and in the big picture does not get you anything useful.  So go
<br>
ahead J. R., add it to the list.
<br>
