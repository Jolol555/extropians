<br>
verdict (<a href="http://freehenson.tripod.com/draf-jnov.txt">http://freehenson.tripod.com/draf-jnov.txt</a>) and after he said he
<br>
would impose sentence  reversed himself and did not rule on a sentence.
<br>
A probation officer made confused statements about the United States
<br>
State Department getting involved. The prosecution recommended 200 days
<br>
in jail and 5 years formal probation, with the defense making no 
<br>
recommendation.

Defense counsel was not permitted to withdraw.

</em><br>
<p>It's not gonna work. Requesting asylum is *the* way to make
<br>
his own presence in Canada difficult for the Canadian state,
<br>
and to let politics take the upper hand. Canada might be a
<br>
kind country with a kind government, but not so kind as to
<br>
jeopardise its relations with the US for Keith's sake by
<br>
declaring the US a country that does not respect human rights,
<br>
which is exactly what a country does when it grants asylum to
<br>
the citizen of another country. The times of the Vietnam
<br>
draft-dodger refugees are over and even then Canada was
<br>
bound more by its own (pre-existing) laws than by its actual
<br>
good will.
<br>
<p>What's wrong with just a plain ordinary residence permit
<br>
application, like &quot;I like your country and I want to live
<br>
here&quot;? What's wrong with a business setup? Employment?
<br>
What's wrong with any of all those other residence permit
<br>
possibilities, besides asylum?
<br>
<p>Besides, when an asylum application is turned down, the
<br>
refugee is deported to his own country; in Keith's case
<br>
to the US and straight to jail. When an ordinary application
<br>
for residence is turned down, the applicant is not deported
<br>
at all, but is simply requested to leave the country and
<br>
is free to go anywhere he chooses.
