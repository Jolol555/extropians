Hi,
<br>
<p>Ok, I promised I'd shut up, but I won't quite yet ...
<br>
<p>[Promises, promises...]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you can't, on a deep emotional level, see the connection between my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work and the starving people in the Sudan, then this - from my perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - is an emotional peculiarity on your part, not mine.
</em><br>
<p>I do perceive the connection, of course, both rationally and emotionally.
<br>
Your work has a decent chance of increasing the probability that the
<br>
Singularity is good for humans, and it's therefore a very important kind of
<br>
work.  I feel the same way about my own work.  AI technology is going to do
<br>
a lot of good for a lot of people, someday.  I do feel AI will be a
<br>
profoundly positive technology for humans, not a negative one like, say,
<br>
nuclear weapons, which I wouldn't enjoy working on even if it were
<br>
intellectually stimulating.
<br>
<p>But yet, for reasons that are still not easy for me to articulate, I feel a
<br>
bit of discomfort with **solely focusing one's life** on this type of
<br>
compassionate activity -- on &quot;helping people by doing things that will help
<br>
them in the future but don't affect them at all right now.&quot;   This is a good
<br>
kind of activity to be doing, for sure.  But yet, I feel that, in general,
<br>
this kind of long-term helping of others can be conducted better if it's
<br>
harmonized with a short-term helping of others.
<br>
<p>I can partially articulate what's in my mind here via a parable, although
<br>
this doesn't catch everything I feel on the subject by any means.
<br>
<p>Here's the parable.  Suppose you're stuck on a boat in the middle of the
<br>
ocean with a bunch of people, and they're really hungry, and the boat is
<br>
drifting away from the island that you know is to the east.  Suppose you're
<br>
the **only** person on the boat who can fish well, and also the only person
<br>
who can paddle well.  You may be helping the others most by ignoring their
<br>
short-term needs (fish) in favor of their longer-term needs (getting to the
<br>
island).  If you get them to the island, then eventually they'll get to an
<br>
island with lots of food on it, a much better situation than being on a
<br>
sinking boat with a slightly full stomach.
<br>
<p>If the other people don't **realize** the boat is drifting in the wrong
<br>
direction, though, because, they don't realize the island is there, then
<br>
what?  Then they'll just think you're a bit loopy for paddling so hard.  And
<br>
if they know you're a great fisherman, they'll be annoyed at you for not
<br>
helping them get food....
<br>
<p>What is this little parable missing?  Sociality.  If you feed the other
<br>
people, they'll be stronger, and maybe they'll be more help in paddling the
<br>
boat.  Furthermore, if you maintain a friendly relationship with them by
<br>
helping them out in ways that they perceive as well as ways that they do
<br>
not, then they're more likely to collaborate creatively with you in figuring
<br>
out ways to save the situation.  Maybe because of their friendship with you,
<br>
they'll take your notion that there's an island to the east more seriously,
<br>
and they'll think about ways to get there faster, and they'll notice a
<br>
current that you didn't notice, floating on which will allow you to get
<br>
there faster with less paddling.
<br>
<p>The difference here is between the following two attitudes
<br>
<p>1)  Seeking to, as a lone and noble crusader, save the world in spite of
<br>
itself
<br>
2)  Seeking to cooperatively engage the world in the process of saving
<br>
itself
<br>
<p>To do 2, it's not enough to do things that **you** perceive are good for
<br>
everyone in the long run.  You have to gain the good will of others, and
<br>
work with them together on things that both they, and you, feel are
<br>
important.
<br>
<p>Of course, it's impossible and undesirable to have a consensus among all
<br>
humans as to what is good and what is bad.  So like most things in the human
<br>
world, the distinction between 1 and 2 is fuzzy rather than absolute.
<br>
<p>I realize that you, Eli, are trying to cooperatively engage the world in the
<br>
process of saving itself your way, by publishing your thoughts on Friendly
<br>
AI.  But I have an inkling that the way to cooperatively engage the world in
<br>
the process of saving itself ISN'T to try to convince them to see them your
<br>
way through rational argumentation.  Rather, it's to try to enter into a
<br>
real dialogue where each side (transhumanists vs. normal people in this
<br>
case) makes a deep and genuine effort to understand the perspective of the
<br>
other side.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since I *do*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceive the connection on a deep emotional level, I live free of the fog
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of guilt that pervades the First World.
</em><br>
<p>I don't feel very much guilt, actually.  I'm not sure what the word is for
<br>
what I feel....  Our language for describing emotions is very crude...
<br>
that's what music's for, I guess ;&gt;
<br>
<p>What I mean is: I am not made unhappy by observing my own reaction to the
<br>
starving people in the Third World.  I don't think my own reaction, and the
<br>
way I conduct my life, is reprehensible.  I'm just interested in finding
<br>
ways to do even better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is absolutely *nothing* I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could do that would help the rest of the world more than what I am already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing.
</em><br>
<p>In my view, given the numerous uncertainties as to the timing and
<br>
qualitative nature of the Singularity, it is irrational of you to hold to
<br>
this view with such immense certainty.
<br>
<p>Actually, I honestly feel that if you spent a year teaching kids in the
<br>
Sudan, you'd probably end up contributing MORE to the world than if you just
<br>
kept doing exactly what you're doing now.  You'd gain a different sort of
<br>
understanding of human nature, and a different sort of connection with
<br>
people, which would enrich your work in a lot of ways that you can hardly
<br>
imagine at the moment.  Not to mention a healthy respect for indoor
<br>
plumbing!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I feel a need to do something about the starving people in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sudan and I AM DOING IT; that need is now FULLY SATISFIED.  Rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; striving for &quot;balance&quot; between personal life and altruism, I have decided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to allow my desire to be altruistic to *completely* dictate my life-path.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this part of the discussion is getting kind of personal, so I'll drop
<br>
it.  Except to say that, in my view, sometimes this kind of &quot;others over
<br>
self&quot; attitude is psychologically healthy, and sometimes not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think, Ben, that we react to certain problems in different ways.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see starving people in Sudan and think to yourself:  &quot;Is what I'm doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really helping?  Maybe I should just give it all away.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think anything that extreme, really.  Not very often, anyway.  I
<br>
just think that it might be better if I shifted the balance of my life a
<br>
little more in the direction of doing concretely helpful things for people
<br>
**right now**.
<br>
<p>Although this isn't practical for me at the moment, I do plan to effect this
<br>
change in my life at some point in the next few years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There was a time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I felt guilty on seeing starving people in Sudan, and what I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to myself was:  &quot;Could I be working a little harder?  Am I making the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong tradeoff between rest time and work time, or between energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expenditure and energy recovery?&quot;  In other words, I saw starving people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Sudan and felt guilty - so I worked faster.  (Nowadays I'm a bit more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confident that I'm at the right equilibrium, and being guilty does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissipate mental energy, so I try to implement a policy of only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reevaluating work habits when new information arrives.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But this isn't the kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing for which one can make a logical argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *What*?  Oh, never mind.  (Now, if you were to say, &quot;I'm sure there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical argument for this, but I haven't learned to formalize my gut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feelings,&quot; that would be another matter.)
</em><br>
<p>Well there were several things underlying that statement...
<br>
<p>1) It is true that it's difficult for me to formalize my gut feelings on
<br>
these topics.
<br>
<p>2) Reason is only useful when there is adequate, and adequately crisp, data
<br>
for it to operate upon.  In the presence of very fuzzy or very scant data,
<br>
logical inference is of less value than cruder &quot;intuition-type&quot; methods....
<br>
Questions like &quot;Is it better to focus all one's compassionate efforts on
<br>
long-term things or to balance long and short term compassionate efforts&quot;
<br>
are questions on which there is not sufficiently crisp data for logical
<br>
reasoning to be worthwhile.
<br>
<p>3) In areas where there is scant or fuzzy data, our emotions tend to rule
<br>
us.  Ethics and &quot;how to live one's life&quot; are definitely areas that fit this
<br>
criterion!  Arguing about this stuff is sort of like arguing about
<br>
religion... not useful except in special cases....  Perhaps this dialogue is
<br>
one of those special cases, I'm not sure...
<br>
<p>It's certainly clear to me that you and I could argue about this stuff until
<br>
we were both blue in the face and still not agree with each other, anyway!!
<br>
<p><p>Anyway... enough of that... I should get some sleep tonight!
