<em>&gt; I predict that as soon as practical, all our weapons and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surveillance systems will be drones with their controllers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warm and safe at home.  spike
</em><br>
<p>N. Tesla predicted that we would see the end of war when all humans were removed
<br>
from it, and we became fed up with the cost of replacing the robots.  Here are the
<br>
last four paragraphs from his autobiography _My Inventions_ (written early in the
<br>
last century).
<br>
<p>-Ken
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The next logical improvement was its application to automatic mechanisms beyond the limits of vision and at great distances from the center of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control, and I have ever since advocated their employment as instruments of warfare in preference to guns. The importance of this now seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognized, if I am to judge from casual announcements through the press, of achievements which are said to be extraordinary but contain no merit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novelty, whatever. In an imperfect manner it is practicable, with the existing wireless plants, to launch an airplane, have it follow a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximate course, and perform some operation at a distance of many hundreds of miles. A machine of this kind can also be mechanically controlled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in several ways and I have no doubt that it may prove of some usefulness in war. But there are to my best knowledge, no instrumentalities in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence today with which such an object could be accomplished in a precise manner. I have devoted years of study to this matter and have evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means, making such and greater wonders easily realizable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As stated on a previous occasion, when I was a student at college I conceived a flying machine quite unlike the present ones. The underlying principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was sound, but could not be carried into practice for want of a prime-mover of sufficiently great activity. In recent years, I have successfully solved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this problem and am now planning aerial machines *devoid of sustaining planes, ailerons, propellers, and other external* attachments, which will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of immense speeds and are very likely to furnish powerful arguments for peace in the near future. Such a machine, sustained and propelled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *entirely by reaction*, is shown on one of the pages of my lectures, and is supposed to be controlled either mechanically, or by wireless energy. By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; installing proper plants, it will be practicable to *project a missile of this kind into the air and drop it* almost on the very spot designated, which may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be thousands of miles away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But we are not going to stop at this. Telautomats will be ultimately produced, capable of acting as if possessed of their own intelligence, and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advent will create a revolution. As early as 1898, I proposed to representatives of a large manufacturing concern the construction and public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exhibition of an automobile carriage which, left to itself, would perform a great variety of operations involving something akin to judgment. But my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposal was deemed chimerical at the time and nothing came of it.  At present, many of the ablest minds are trying to devise expedients for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preventing a repetition of the awful conflict which is only theoretically ended and the duration and main issues of which I have correctly predicted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an article printed in the SUN of December 20, 1914. The proposed League is not a remedy but, on the contrary, in the opinion of a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competent men, may bring about results just the opposite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is particularly regrettable that a punitive policy was adopted in framing the terms of peace, because a few years hence, it will be possible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations to fight without armies, ships or guns, by weapons far more terrible, to the destructive action and range of which there is virtually no limit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any city, at a distance, whatsoever, from the enemy, can be destroyed by him and no power on earth can stop him from doing so. If we want to avert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an impending calamity and a state of things which may transform the globe into an inferno, we should push the development of flying machines and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wireless transmission of energy without an instant's delay and with all the power and resources of the nation.
</em><br>
