<p>There's nothing outside which is not sporulated, and even then it has
<br>
a damn short half lifetime.

<p>As to atomic oxygen, few 100 km above of Earth surface still sees plenty
<br>
of atmosphere. In fact it's enough to see the wind-side surfaces emit a
<br>
faint glow (radicals recombining on surfaces, I would imagine). This would
<br>
slowly erode anything organic.
<br>
<p>In deep space you don't have that, but you've got microparticle impact.
<br>
Anywhere with high insolation you got solar wind and shortwave radiation
<br>
weathering. Look at asteroid regolith vs. fresh surfaces.
