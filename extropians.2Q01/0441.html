<p>
hello all, i wasn't watching the list for the last month because of my 
<br>
schedule. now my university is in spring break so i have
<br>
sometime.
<br>
<p>i consider myself a muslim extropian. (i guess the time has come to start 
<br>
the muslim extro movement. about a year ago somebody predicted that there 
<br>
will be muslim extros etc. his prohpecy is becoming real.)
<br>
<p>i am turkish. i don't consider myself a real excellent follower but i 
<br>
believe in god, and the religion makes sense to me.
<br>
<p>i am doing my phd in electrical engineering at usc in los angeles.
<br>
<p>i found extropy.com about 3 years ago and i like most of the extropian 
<br>
principles. in fact i can say that extropy movement and principles has made 
<br>
an impact on my thinking style.
<br>
<p>i liked all the previous emails about islam and extropianism. it is great to 
<br>
be able to see all the different ideas and views.
<br>
<p>for now i just want to comment on some points as have more time, material 
<br>
and reply emails, i will try to write more.
<br>
<p>violence in islam: i think this all comes from misinterpretation of quran 
<br>
and politics. i am a secular person. i hate it when people use the religion 
<br>
in politics. i think politics corrupts people and religions and it is the 
<br>
reason for the existence of terrorism.
<br>
<p>there are some verses in quran that say fight and conquer places and spread 
<br>
the islam. buy everybody who has just studied islam a little bit from 
<br>
objective sources know that the times were different when those verses were 
<br>
revelaed. at that time there were only thousands of muslims and they were 
<br>
constantly being attacked but enemies.
<br>
<p>there is only one quran but there are many different interpretations. there 
<br>
are some professors in turkey who started to interpret the quran differently 
<br>
and they tried to modernize the interpretation considering the current time. 
<br>
i know they are getting a lot of publicity in television. i like the new 
<br>
interpretation.
<br>
they also show how islam and quran was used to make profit by people. i 
<br>
don't know any english versions of their books, and in fact, i haven't read 
<br>
any books on the subject yet.
<br>
<p>there are many ways to interpret things for example you can interpret 
<br>
cryogenics as reincarnation and if you read quran you'll see many references 
<br>
to that.
<br>
<p>and i don't know how many people on the list visited turkey or know things 
<br>
about it other than stereotypes here are some places to visit on the web. 
<br>
for starters turkish people are turks not arabs. turkish language uses roman 
<br>
characters not arabic. topless sunbathing is allowed in turkey's beaches, 
<br>
etc.
