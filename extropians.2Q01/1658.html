<p>Sure, depending on your field and where you're studying and how bright you
<br>
are you can get a Ph.D. pretty damn quick. Probably 5 years, 8 tops. Apart
<br>
from the letter after your name, you'll even find you've learned one or
<br>
two useful things, if you've chosen the right school and haven't wasted
<br>
your time.

<p><em>&gt; Burch explained to me that social entities attain status and position as a

<p>Yah, you have to play by the rules of the game if you want support from
<br>
other people (most people do).
