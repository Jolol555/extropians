</em><br>
<p>In _A Universe of Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination_,
<br>
Gerald M. Edelman and Giulio Tononi attempt to offer a physical
<br>
interpretation of qualia.  
<br>
<p>I mentioned this book in the long overview of Edelman
<br>
I posted here last year
<br>
( <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/5574.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/5574.html</a> ),
<br>
which contains the following paragraph:
<br>
<p>--------------------
<br>
<p>The concept of consciousness as a dynamic core, and of the brain
<br>
as its own observer, are used by Edelman and Tononi as a
<br>
springboard to tackle the difficult problem of qualia (UoC
<br>
Chap. 13): &quot;The specific quality, or 'quale' of subjective
<br>
experience -- of color, warmth, pain, a loud sound -- has seemed
<br>
beyond scientific explanation&quot; (UoC p. 157).  To provide a
<br>
scientific basis for qualia, the authors first recast the dynamic
<br>
core as an N-dimensional space, where N is the number of neuronal
<br>
groups currently participating in the core (a &quot;large number, say,
<br>
between 10^3 and 10^7&quot; [Uoc p. 165]): &quot;Since a functional cluster
<br>
identifies a single, unified physical process, it follows that
<br>
the activity of these N neuronal groups should be considered
<br>
within a single reference space [a set of axes having a common
<br>
origin]&quot; (UoC p. 165).  &quot;The number of points that can be
<br>
differentiated in this N-dimensional space -- which make a
<br>
difference to it -- is vast, as indicated by high values of
<br>
complexity...  however, a large number of participating neuronal
<br>
groups alone [a large value of N] is not a guarantee of high
<br>
complexity...  If, for example, the firing of the N neuronal
<br>
groups... were synchronized to an extreme degree, as is the case
<br>
during epileptic seizures, the actual repertoire of neural states
<br>
available to the dynamic core would be... just a few positions in
<br>
the N-dimensional space&quot; (UoC p. 166).  &quot;[E]very discriminable
<br>
point in the N-dimensional space defined by the dynamic core
<br>
identifies a conscious state, while a trajectory joining points
<br>
in this space would correspond to a sequence of conscious states
<br>
occurring over time.  Contrary to common usage by many
<br>
philosophers and scientists, we suggest that... **every conscious
<br>
state deserves to be called a quale**&quot; (UoC p. 168).  The
<br>
conscious experience of a quale therefore corresponds to the
<br>
discrimination of one particular state (one particular point in
<br>
the N-dimensional space) out of all the possible states of the
<br>
dynamic core.
