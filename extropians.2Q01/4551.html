</em><br>
<em>&gt; is about to say &quot;Yes&quot;, so naturally he says &quot;No&quot;.  Well, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after he writes down his answer somewhere, and some time travel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparatus gets hold of it, it's now the &quot;No&quot; answer that flies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backwards in time.  This time, the past Contrarian is presented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the &quot;He said No&quot; information, and so says &quot;Yes&quot;.  Then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later, when **his** information is written down and then used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the time travel apparatus, the cycle repeats.
</em><br>
<p>The Extropy article by Hans Moravec can be found at
<br>
<a href="http://cart.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html">http://cart.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html</a>.
<br>
He analyzes electronic circuits suitable for computers which contain a
<br>
negative time delay element.  This sends signals into the past and adds
<br>
extraordinary power to computers if properly exploited.
<br>
<p>He considers an electronic analog of the Contrarian, a time-delay
<br>
circuit which has an inverter.  If the present value of the circuit is
<br>
1, it goes to 0 in the past, and vice versa.  Moravec claims that the
<br>
inverter circuit would actually reach an intermediate voltage level,
<br>
balanced between 0 and 1.  Although digital circuits are of course
<br>
designed to avoid this state, the peculiar circumstances make this the
<br>
only stable and consistent state.
<br>
<p>Applying this to the human Contrarian, I suppose one possible result
<br>
is that he receives an unintelligible or ambiguous signal.  Although
<br>
the system would be designed to avoid this, it is the only stable
<br>
state and so this is what will happen.
<br>
<p>I find this more convincing than Deutsch's interpretation because I
<br>
believe it can be rigorously analyzed quantum mechanically in some
<br>
simple cases.  A similar example is the famous Novikov billiards shot
<br>
in which balls come out of wormholes before they go in, yet attempts
<br>
to set up &quot;Contrarians&quot; produce consistent but surprising paths.
<br>
(This was used dramatically in Robert Forward's novel Timemaster.)
<br>
He analyzed this in full QM detail to show how it would work.
<br>
<p>I don't believe Deutsch's explanation are similarly backed up.  The idea
<br>
of identifying parallel worlds with time travel endpoints is just hand
<br>
waving.  The Deutsch parallel worlds are QM many-worlds branches and so
<br>
they have a mathematical relationship with each other.  Deutsch never
<br>
shows that a time travel machine would have specific quantum mechanical
<br>
effects that would correspond to ending up in a different Everett branch.
<br>
(I may be wrong about this, maybe he has a rigorous analysis that I am
<br>
not aware of.)
