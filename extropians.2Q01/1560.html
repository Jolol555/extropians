It's hard to keep up with the score as socialist (or &quot;The left&quot; as James
<br>
Watson, discoverer of DNA's double helix, calls it) thinkers insinuate their
<br>
ideas into as much of the world's creeds as possible. The people I know that
<br>
I'd call religious are Lutherans and Jews, and a few Baptists down the hill in
<br>
Redding. Socialism seems to be a subset of their religion. When I complained
<br>
about the two million people in the US prison system, my neighbor, Bernie
<br>
Rosen, told me that he'd like to put more criminals in jail, the way people
<br>
act is disgraceful, etc.
<br>
<p>Watson:
<br>
&quot;I say it was the left: they were against Nixon, they were against Dow
<br>
chemicals, they were against napalm, they were against pollution. So DNA
<br>
was going to be another polluter. E coli was going to give women in the
<br>
biology building cystitis.&quot;
<br>
<p>Don't misunderstand. Extropians know that recovering Leftists can serve
<br>
extropic ends. But I agree with James Watson that &quot;The left&quot; opposes hi-tech
<br>
because it conflicts with anti-capitalist ideology, despite limousine
<br>
liberal's use of capital in the fight against hi-tech infidels.

<p><p><em>&gt; That's interesting. All but one of the religious people I know are far-right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservatives, and are very anti- any tech that seems to conflict with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious beliefs and/or won't put money in their own pockets (this often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over-rides the religious concerns). Most of the liberals I know are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agnostic/atheist and capitalist, with varying attitudes on various tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues. I haven't met a liberal in years that would honestly call him- or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; herself a socialist (except maybe sarcastically), and Marx is pretty tired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff, especially for those of us who went through college in the 70s or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 80s. Yawn. I guess it all depends on who you know and where you live . . .
