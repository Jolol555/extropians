<em>&gt; &gt;#Okay, here's the biggie for me--and maybe it's been covered in the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is and you don't care; you just want to take it. Don't care what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you'll be, just want to get there. Don't consider that when you do,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay.  Good.  Something to focus in on.  The 'biggie' is Loss of Humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, as you put it moments later, &quot;you won't retain human values.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The words 'humanity' and 'human values' are code words for 'someone else's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of what constitutes humanity' and 'someone else's idea of what values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are 'right' values'.  I'm not buying it.  It's a veiled attempt to dictate
</em><br>
<p><p>This seems pretty bogus.  What are *your* ideas of what human values are
<br>
and what the interests of human beings are and what and whether it
<br>
matters and to what degree?  It is not fair to simply disown the
<br>
perfectly legitimate question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; my choice of values for myself.  Life is filled with uncertainty and risk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How I choose to confront these realities is, for the most part, nobody's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business but my own.  I say 'for the most part' because, clearly, choices I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make for myself will inevitably have some impact on others.  However,
</em><br>
<p>Choices we make on the way to singularity impact everyone directly and
<br>
utterly.  Traditional libertarian separation of interests just doesn't
<br>
cut it.  When we choose to fire up the SI we are choosing for more than
<br>
ourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that's always been the case.  But choosing transhumanism for myself, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing so 'recklessly', is not the same as forcing transhumanism on others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet you, John, (and those 'others') don't hesitate for a moment to arrogate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right, and presume the legitimacy, of forcing their 'correct' humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and their 'correct' values on me.  I respect your right to choose your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values and your own path.  I'll take care of mine, thankyouverymuch,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps recklessly, perhaps boldly.
</em><br>
<p>This gets us nowhere.  The problem is global and crucial to understand. 
<br>
It is not a matter of normal political positioning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, returning briefly to 'humanity' and 'human values', just what are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these?  The tribal prejudices of some organized superstition (religion), or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the political platitudes of some governing ideology?  Shall we offer for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sake of comparison the FULL record--which is to say a truthful and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete record of all the dark deeds of humans manifesting their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'humanity' and 'human values'-- not merely the sublime, the sanitized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical apologism of the current cultural myth?  Shall we then, in light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this honest accounting, ask what of our 'humanity' and 'human values'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserves preserving?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This disowning language is again not helpful.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The question of loss of humanity is, at best, grounded in ignorance and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudice and primitive fear, and presumes, based on an historical fantasy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moral and rational correctness of the current state of affairs.  At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst it is a devious and deceitful ploy to maintain control, based on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historically effective but lately tattered idea that God and Ceasar know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's right and therefore you must obey.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ignorance?  Excuse me but we have discussed on here the distinct
<br>
possibility than an SI or a nanotech accident or deliberate weapon or
<br>
several other possible scenarios will wipe out all of humankind.  That
<br>
is not ignorance, prejudice or primitive fear in the least.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanism is merely the current manifestation of the ancient quest to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand and progress.  That's 'progress' as in 'to make things better'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Are we likely to stumble along the way?  Well, duh.)  Thus, transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is FUNDAMENTALLY ethical.  We are unsatisfied with, unimpressed by, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unwilling to meekly accept the limitations on justice, freedom, ethics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassion, health, intelligence, and personal fullfillment, imposed on our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'humanity' by the accidents of biology.  I welcome the criticism of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critics.  I celebrate their freedom to criticize.  And I celebrate my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom to dismiss the strident protests of the misguided and misinformed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to shrug off the looming umbrage of their masters.  My mind is my own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is the heart of Transhumanism.  That is what makes it unstoppable.
</em><br>
<p>I hope you enjoyed that soapbox.  Now step down and deal with the actual
<br>
question.
