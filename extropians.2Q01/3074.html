<p>Good Times
<br>
Are we making progress? Ignore the gloomy intellectuals and look at the 
<br>
facts.
<br>
<p>By Ronald Bailey
<br>
<p>In some intellectual circles, it is fashionable to dismiss the idea of 
<br>
progress, the notion that social, political, and material conditions for the 
<br>
mass of humanity are getting better. Langdon Winner, a professor at 
<br>
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, recently asserted at the International 
<br>
Forum on Globalization's Teach-In on Technology and Globalization that &quot;all 
<br>
indices of performance are improving, but the world is not getting better.&quot; 
<br>
He added that this &quot;used to be called progress, which we don't hear much 
<br>
about anymore.&quot;
<br>
<p>New York University social critic and author of Technopoly: The Surrender of 
<br>
Culture to Technology, Neil Postman once dismissively declared that &quot;America 
<br>
has developed a new religion, as it were, and the religion is its faith that 
<br>
human progress and technological innovation are the same thing.&quot; The ranks 
<br>
of progress skeptics include such notables as Jacques Ellul, Christopher 
<br>
Lasch, Herbert Marcuse, Chellis Glendenning, Lewis Mumford, Jeremy Rifkin 
<br>
and many others.
<br>
<p>Despite the skepticism of these and other disaffected intellectuals, the 
<br>
evidence supports the notion that there has indeed been a lot of progress, 
<br>
by which I mean substantial improvement in the quality of and prospects for 
<br>
human life. To be sure, we are not talking heaven on Earth. But relative 
<br>
improvement? Absolutely.
<br>
<p>Let's review the evidence. Probably the most concrete measure of progress is 
<br>
the vast increase in human life expectancy over the past century. 
<br>
Demographers believe that global life expectancy in 1900 was around 30 
<br>
years. By 1950 it had increased to 48 years. Today, global life expectancy 
<br>
is 66 years and is expected to rise to 73 years by 2025, according to the 
<br>
World Health Organization. The really good news is that the difference in 
<br>
life expectancy between the developed world and the less-developed regions 
<br>
of the globe has narrowed dramatically from more than 25 years in the early 
<br>
1950s to around 11 years today.
<br>
<p>The burden of disease has also lifted considerably. The annual number of 
<br>
deaths among people under age 50 fell from 21 million in 1955 to about 10 
<br>
million in 1997. Deaths under 50 are expected to decline further, to 5 
<br>
million, by 2025. This is an extraordinary improvement in human health since 
<br>
world population in 1955 was 2.8 billion and is now over 6 billion.
<br>
<p>For those worried about population growth, the average number of children a 
<br>
woman has over the course of her lifetime has dropped from just under 6 in 
<br>
1960 to 2.9 today. If current fertility trends continue, U.N. population 
<br>
figures suggest that world population is likely to top out at a bit over 8 
<br>
billion and begin to fall by the middle of this century. As important, women 
<br>
(and men, too, in their own fashion) have more control over their fertility.
<br>
<p>Widespread famines are thing of the past. Global food prices have dropped by 
<br>
50 percent since 1960 largely because food production increased at faster 
<br>
pace than population growth.
<br>
<p>Between 1820 and 1992, the world's economies grew 40-fold. More recently, 
<br>
world gross domestic product tripled from $9.5 trillion in 1970 to $29 
<br>
trillion in 1998. Average wages in America tripled in real terms from $8 per 
<br>
hour in 1949 to $24 per hour today. Without minimizing the hardships that 
<br>
many Americans face, the good news is that poverty in this country isn't 
<br>
what it used to be. Michael Cox, an economist at the Dallas Federal Reserve 
<br>
Bank, points out that of those households officially below the poverty line, 
<br>
97 percent have color TVs, and two-thirds live in air-conditioned dwellings 
<br>
and have microwaves. Seventy-five percent own VCRs and own at least one car. 
<br>
Forty-one percent own their own homes, and 50 percent own stereos and almost 
<br>
all have refrigerators and cooking stoves. The poor in the U.S. today have a 
<br>
higher standard of consumption than the average household did in 1971. (See 
<br>
&quot;Buying Time&quot;)
<br>
<p>Humanity's inventiveness has exploded too. In 1790, when the U.S. Patent 
<br>
Office opened its doors, it granted just 3 patents. By 1882, the Patent 
<br>
Office had issued serial number 50,000 for its patent applications. Of 
<br>
course, the 19th century was the century which saw the invention of the 
<br>
steamboat, the railroad, the telegraph, the mass market newspaper, 
<br>
nitroglycerin, the germ theory of disease, chemistry and the periodic table 
<br>
of elements. In 1899, the year when patent serial number 700,000 was 
<br>
assigned, the Commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office famously recommended 
<br>
that his office be abolished because &quot;Everything that can be invented has 
<br>
been invented.&quot; How wrong he was is illustrated simply by noting that at the 
<br>
end of the year 2000, the patent serial number 9,471,932 had been assigned.
<br>
<p>In 1900, the few thousand existing automobiles were the expensive toys of 
<br>
the very rich. By 1950, there were 70 million vehicles. Today, there are 
<br>
more than 500 million-one for every 6 people on the planet.
<br>
<p>In 1975, the United States had 200,000 of the world's total of 300,000 
<br>
computers. Today there are 160 million computers in use in America-51 
<br>
percent of U.S. households have personal computers, up from 24 percent in 
<br>
1994. Today, there are 557 million computers in use worldwide. In the past 
<br>
40 years, global computing power has increased a billion-fold. A Ford Taurus 
<br>
contains more computing power than the multi-million dollar main-frame 
<br>
computers used in the Apollo space program.
<br>
<p>Today, the 100 million mobile phones used by Americans are one-third of the 
<br>
total 300 million mobile phones in use worldwide. By 2005, as many as 1.6 
<br>
billion people will be cell phone subscribers.
<br>
<p>The internet is used by 423 million people and that is expected to rise to 
<br>
over 1 billion by 2005. Two years ago, former vice-president Al Gore told 
<br>
the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting that 
<br>
there were only 4 websites when he took office. Now Google searches 
<br>
1,346,966,000 web pages.
<br>
<p>Since 1970, 4,355 new drug applications have been filed with the U.S. Food 
<br>
and Drug Administration. And at the dawn of the 21st century, scientists 
<br>
have sequenced the human genome, and the genomes of many other important 
<br>
species, opening up fantastic possibilities for further improving human 
<br>
health and crop production.
<br>
<p>Today, 92 percent of primary school age boys and 88 percent of girls are in 
<br>
school worldwide. Even in the lowest-income countries, the comparable 
<br>
figures are 89 percent for boys and 82 percent for girls.
<br>
<p>Progress is not confined to the material and technological sphere. Liberty 
<br>
too has increased. First, one should keep in mind that the centuries-old 
<br>
evil of slavery was essentially abolished in the 19th century. The 20th 
<br>
century saw a dramatic increase in democratic governance. According to 
<br>
Freedom House, there were no nation-states that met its definition for being 
<br>
fully democratic in 1900. &quot;The states with restricted democratic practices, 
<br>
not universal suffrage, were 25 in number and accounted for just 12.4 
<br>
percent of the world's population. In 1900 monarchies and empires 
<br>
predominated,&quot; notes Freedom House.
<br>
<p>In 1950, there were 22 democracies, accounting for 31 percent of the world's 
<br>
population, and an additional 21 states had restricted democratic practices, 
<br>
accounting for 11.9 percent of the globe's population. Today, 120 of the 
<br>
world's 192 countries are electoral democracies and constitute 62.5 percent 
<br>
of the world's population. At the same time liberal democracies--that is, 
<br>
countries which Freedom House regards as free and respectful of basic human 
<br>
rights and the rule of law--are 85 in number and represent 38 percent of the 
<br>
world's people.
<br>
<p>MIT social critic Leo Marx once tendentiously asked, &quot;Does Improved 
<br>
Technology Mean Progress?&quot; Let's just say that the evidence of history 
<br>
strongly suggests that improved technology is a prerequisite for progress, 
<br>
both material and social. Before modern technology, poverty, tyranny, and 
<br>
ignorance were the lot of most people. Technology enables more and more 
<br>
people to pursue the humanitarian goals of justice, freedom, and 
<br>
self-fulfillment than ever before.
