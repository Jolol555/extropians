EXTRO-5 -- LUNCH GATHERINGS
<br>
<p>Spike is already gathering info on sushi restaurants near to the conference 
<br>
hotel -- the San Jose Hilton &amp; Towers. We plan to have in the registration 
<br>
packets a list of all the nearby restaurants to make it easy for attendees 
<br>
to find a place for lunch on Saturday and Sunday (and Friday for early 
<br>
arrivals, and Sunday dinner for those who refuse to go home).
<br>
<p>I regard networking as an especially important aspect of this fifth Extro, 
<br>
so I want to have a list of places to eat and sign-up boards to enable 
<br>
people more easily to get to know each other or to talk more by arranging 
<br>
to meet at particular places for lunch.
<br>
<p>Apart from having a message board where people can sign up to say that they 
<br>
will be at  particular restaurant, can you suggest ways to help coordinate 
<br>
people who want to flock together? Much will happen spontaneously, but with 
<br>
a large group where you can't always easily find someone you want to lunch 
<br>
with on short notice, some means of connecting up would be helpful. (Maybe 
<br>
in a couple of years we can hand out a cheap PDA that will let you enter 
<br>
the people you want to lunch with and the kinds of food you like and the 
<br>
software will match you up.)
<br>
<p>A public board may not work for everyone, as some may want to meet 
<br>
privately to have a focused lunch discussion. Any suggestions welcome!
<br>
