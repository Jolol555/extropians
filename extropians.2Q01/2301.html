<br>
<p>Google's Larry Page: Good Ideas Still Get Funded 
<br>
The popular search engine's co-founder and CEO says
<br>
plenty of money is available -- it's just a lot more selective 
<br>
<p><p>Some dot-com Don Quixotes may be
<br>
tilting at windmills. Not Google. The
<br>
popular search engine accommodates 70
<br>
million queries a day and expects to
<br>
become profitable in the third quarter of
<br>
2001. And Larry Page, Google's
<br>
co-founder and CEO, believes hot
<br>
Internet ideas and products can still get
<br>
funding, despite the dot-com meltdown. 
<br>
<p>Page recently sat down with
<br>
BusinessWeek Online technology
<br>
reporter Olga Kharif. Along with lessons
<br>
from his own success story, Page also had some advice for
<br>
entrepreneurs who are just starting out. Here are edited
<br>
excerpts of their conversation: 
<br>
<p>Q: Were you ever afraid that Google wouldn't take off?
<br>
A: Sure. All the time. 
<br>
<p>Q: What were your first steps in insuring the success of
<br>
Google?
<br>
A: Well, actually, I think part of the reason we're successful so
<br>
far is that originally we didn't really want to start a business.
<br>
We were doing research at Stanford University. Google sort of
<br>
came out of that. And we didn't even intend to build a search
<br>
engine originally. We were just interested in the Web and
<br>
interested in data mining. And then we ended up with search
<br>
technology that we realized was really good. And we built the
<br>
search engine. Then we told our friends about it and our
<br>
professors. Pretty soon, about 10,000 people a day were using it. 
<br>
<p>Q: At what point did you decide to make a business out of
<br>
it?
<br>
A: We realized by talking to all the CEOs of search companies
<br>
-- which were really turning into portals -- that commercially,
<br>
no one was going to develop search engines. They said, &quot;Oh, we
<br>
don't really care about our search engine.&quot; And we realized
<br>
there was a huge business opportunity and that nobody else was
<br>
going to work on it. 
<br>
<p>And the other thing was, all these people were using Google,
<br>
and we didn't have enough computers or enough resources to
<br>
really provide a great service to people. So we needed capital to
<br>
do that. We wanted to get everyone in the world to use it. 
<br>
<p>We realized we needed a lot of disk space, a lot of hard drives,
<br>
and so we went out and we -- basically I -- found this really
<br>
good deal on hard drives. And we bought, like, 120 hard drives.
<br>
And we had to use all of our credit cards and our friends' credit
<br>
cards and our parents' credit cards. 
<br>
<p>Q: And how did you manage to pay off the credit-card
<br>
debt?
<br>
A: Pretty soon afterwards, we got some private investments
<br>
through Stanford. At the time, actually, Google was growing
<br>
very, very fast. We've grown in traffic about 20% per month
<br>
throughout our whole history. So it was obvious people really
<br>
liked it. The site experienced a kind of viral growth. People
<br>
would tell their friends, and their friends would tell their
<br>
friends. 
<br>
<p>Q: Did you put a lot of effort into creating your business
<br>
plan?
<br>
A: Well, it took a long time -- I mean, the whole process of
<br>
raising money. The first time we did it with our angel investors,
<br>
and the second time we did it with our venture capitalists. It
<br>
takes months. You have to talk to a lot of people, you have to
<br>
find the right people who are interested. I mean, everyone we
<br>
talked to actually wanted to invest. That was a nice thing. But
<br>
that's because it's a great product and everyone was using it.
<br>
People could understand why it was better. That's not true for
<br>
every startup. So I think it had a lot to do with our product and
<br>
maybe lots to do with the climate. We can still raise money very
<br>
easily, if we need it. 
<br>
<p>I think there's still a lot of capital available. There are a lot of
<br>
people who have money. They're just a little bit more selective
<br>
about it. But that's a good thing. That means that any ideas,
<br>
products, that are more likely to be successful will get funded. 
<br>
<p>The way I judge these things is, if you have a product that's
<br>
really gaining a lot of usage, then it's probably a good idea, and
<br>
it's probably going to be significant. And that tends to be a
<br>
metric that investors use as well. Because if it's growing
<br>
naturally, it'll often continue to grow for a long time. 
<br>
<p>Q: What are your goals for the next couple of years?
<br>
A: Basically, our goal is to organize the world's information and
<br>
to make it universally accessible and useful. That's our mission.
<br>
When we started, we had about 30 million Web pages, which
<br>
was quite large for the time -- that was two years ago. Now, we
<br>
have well over a billion Web pages. So that gives you some idea
<br>
of how we've grown in content. So we try to make more and
<br>
more stuff available to people, we try to, when you come to
<br>
Google, fulfill that need that you have as quickly as possible. 
<br>
<p>We try to make it better and better every day. We have about 40
<br>
PhDs in computer science who make Google better, and a
<br>
whole bunch of other technical people. So we're really investing
<br>
to improve the search engine, and that has really paid off.
<br>
We're serving over 70 million searches every day. About half of
<br>
that is on Google.com and half is through about 100 customers
<br>
spread in 30 different countries. That's customers like Yahoo!
<br>
and Netscape and so on. 
<br>
<p>Q: Have you been affected by the dot-com slowdown of the
<br>
past year?
<br>
A: Sure. Everyone is affected by it -- I mean the changing
<br>
conditions. I think in a lot of ways it has been good for us,
<br>
because it makes us stand out more from our competitors and
<br>
from other companies. So actually...we say that we're going to
<br>
be profitable in Q3 of this year. And that's quite conservative.
<br>
We were definitely trying to be profitable before it was
<br>
fashionable. 
<br>
<p>And we're able to rent office space now and things like that.
<br>
Before, it was actually probably three times as expensive as it is
<br>
now. We can also hire people from all these companies,
<br>
whereas before it was harder to get people. 
<br>
<p>Q: What would be your advice to entrepreneurs who think
<br>
they have a great idea right now but are struggling getting
<br>
funded?
<br>
A: Especially on the Web, you have this tremendous
<br>
opportunity to develop the product first. Most of the great Web
<br>
companies we know were developed by a few people, and
<br>
everybody started using those things, right? Yahoo! is a great
<br>
example, Google is a great example. My brother is one of the
<br>
founders of eGroups, which is a mailing-list company which
<br>
actually ran for over a year as just one computer and one
<br>
part-time person. And I actually bought them their first
<br>
computer. It sat under somebody's desk at another Internet
<br>
company, and it just got more and more traffic, more and more
<br>
people using it. And then eventually they were, like, &quot;Oh man,
<br>
we should quit our day jobs and work on this!&quot; 
<br>
<p>Q: Did your brother go into this business following your
<br>
example?
<br>
A: Actually, I encouraged him to start eGroups, and he
<br>
encouraged me to start Google. So we both owe each other a lot.
<br>
But anyway, there was a company, there was a product that a lot
<br>
of people were using. And on the Web, that's really easy to do. I
<br>
mean, this computer that I bought for them processed over 1
<br>
billion e-mail messages. They had a party for the computer
<br>
recently. 
<br>
<p>But you don't need a huge company, just a computer and a
<br>
part-time person. So you don't need to have a 100-person
<br>
company to develop that idea. You can do it in your spare time,
<br>
you can really work on ideas and see if they take off -- rather
<br>
than trying to raise tons of money, millions of dollars for an
<br>
idea that may or may not work. And once you have the product
<br>
and people are using it, it's very easy to raise investment.
