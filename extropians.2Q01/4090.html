<p>An interesting approach, good luck with it!
<br>
<p>Just a few notes: you mention both cryonics and extropians in the first 
<br>
paragraph. Does you bishop understand what you mena with these terms?
<br>
<p>You also use the term &quot;eternal life&quot;. Wouldn't that be misinterpreted in this 
<br>
religious context? Wouldn't &quot;life extension&quot; or &quot;increased lifespan&quot; make 
<br>
more sense with less risk of misunderstanding?
<br>
<p>The note about the UU church was a nice touch - that introduces a bit of 
<br>
eccleastical competition. Overall the apporach of suggesting that the LDS 
<br>
could take a good stance seems to work fine, but you might want to re-word 
<br>
the section about terrorism - that is bound to cause antagonism towards your 
<br>
case.
