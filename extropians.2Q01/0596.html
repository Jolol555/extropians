<em>&gt;  Of course, the higher stress placed on personal relationships in the societies

</em><br>
<p>Actually, the concept of &quot;cultural suicide&quot; is a highly chauvinistic one;
<br>
it's the belief that because Euro-American &quot;Western&quot; culture currently has
<br>
high technology and working government, it means that high technology and
<br>
scientific knowledge and working governments are the proprietary property
<br>
of Western culture, rather than the rightful heritage of every individual
<br>
on Earth.  I personally feel that knowledge and technology are inherently
<br>
cultureless, and I don't care in the slightest about whether July 4th is
<br>
celebrated a year from now - and yet every now and then I hear the
<br>
accusation that I want to impose Western culture on the world.  Raving
<br>
chauvinists, the lot of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do you change the basic habits of mind that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; work is simple, “top-down” institutional reform.  Instead, what is required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a broad-based and deep impetus to honest self-assessment.  How this can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be fostered is the real challenge.
</em><br>
<p>Good luck, you'll need it.  Frankly, I think cultural healing is unlikely
<br>
without a dei-ex-machina technological fix, whether it's ubiquitous
<br>
Internet, Earthweb, or a Sysop Scenario.
