<em>&gt;explaining it to you.
</em><br>
<p>I share this sentiment, and in 1969, it had real force in the world of politics.
<br>
&nbsp;Unfortunately, today the evidence is that the community that finds this
<br>
kind of “for it’s own sake” rationale for manned space exploration and development
<br>
compelling is small and lacks real influence.  Having been a very close
<br>
observer of the field for 35 years, I reach this conclusion sadly, but now
<br>
without real doubt.  The lack of any significant outcry at the Bush NASA
<br>
budget proposal is the most recent current evidence supporting this view.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Robotic stuff is great, but limited and far less likely to draw 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;widespread support. 
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but the point of my post was to make the statement that the community
<br>
of space researchers and developers has to come to terms with this fact
<br>
and learn to live with and prosper after that realization.  This means they
<br>
have to give up the idea that governments will be convinced to commit long-term,
<br>
reliable streams of funding in the billions of dollars (much less tens of
<br>
billions) based on a rationale that boils down to “because it’s so COOL!”
<br>
&nbsp;The days when that worked are over and we just have to get over it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Private industry must see concrete profitable motivations for this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stuff. NASA never needed that, and shouldn't
</em><br>
<p>Again, I think you have to take a historical view.  NASA’s predecessor,
<br>
NACA, was a small, pure-research arm of the US federal government whose
<br>
mandate was to undertake a few items of technologically strategic work as
<br>
a seed to further development by the military and private industry.  NACA’s
<br>
transformation into NASA, and the addition of a mandate to undertake major
<br>
DEVELOPMENT and then OPERATIONAL work, was PURELY a function of a unique
<br>
mix of factors arising out of the Cold War in the mid- to late-1950s.  
<br>
<p>In a laudably opportunistic fashion, three generations of space scientists
<br>
managed to piggyback some amazingly fruitful work onto the momentum imparted
<br>
by NASA’s core Cold War mandate.  Out of sheer institutional inertia and
<br>
a couple of transitory diplomatic opportunities (most notably, the perceived
<br>
need to employ the former Soviet ballistic missile industry in service of
<br>
the ISS program, rather than as an exporter of ICBM technology), NASA has
<br>
managed to coast into its current set of programs.  But, again, the current
<br>
“epilogue” period seems to now be drawing to a close and the space community
<br>
must be prepared for the residual funding of NASA in the annual multi-billion
<br>
dollar range to come to a halt in a more or less smooth fashion.
<br>
<p>As for “private industry” as it is currently oriented to space development,
<br>
there is one and only one current vital economic opportunity to be exploited
<br>
through space technology and that is LEO commsats, with a very slight secondary
<br>
market for private earth-observation capabilities.  All attempts to articulate
<br>
and fund development of other market opportunities over the last 30 years
<br>
have been – to be brutally honest – pathetic failures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; --though they're now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forming some very interesting partnerships and spreading their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;activities over many more states (this latter presumably for greater 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political support). NASA says every $1 into the program generates 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;$14, however.
</em><br>
<p>The X-33 was the flagship of NASA’s “public-private partnership” initiative.
<br>
&nbsp;Its recent fate speaks volumes about the success of that idea.  Beyond
<br>
that, NASA HAS been quite adept at insinuating itself into as many congressional
<br>
districts as possible and playing the pork barrel game as astutely as any
<br>
federal agency, perhaps a residual legacy of its first great sponsor, the
<br>
Machiavellian Lyndon Johnson.  But pork is pork and is utterly exposed to
<br>
the regular pressures of electoral and party politics.  This year’s prize
<br>
federal program becomes next year’s bargaining chip as each legislative
<br>
supporter of NASA’s budget negotiates his own course through the on-going
<br>
political squall of Washington deal-making.
<br>
<p>Finally, the “spinoff payback” may or may not be true, but is the kind of
<br>
calculus that is very dependent on a lot of assumptions about what would
<br>
NOT have been done without NASA spending as a “pump-priming” mechanism.
<br>
&nbsp;Once again, that kind of rationale for space development spending is very
<br>
ad-hoc and requires maintenance of a constant, on-going political effort
<br>
at “selling” NASA in Congress.  Politicians are mainly lawyers and grow
<br>
up professionally knowing a contrived, after-the-fact argument for what
<br>
it is.  It’s not hard for me to imagine the kind of cynical sneer that most
<br>
Congressmen must wear when they are presented with the “$14 for $1 payback”
<br>
argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As to industry developing an independent space infrastructure--the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cost is staggering. The United States ill afford to duplicate the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;NASA infrastructure today.
</em><br>
<p>I’m not sure I know what you mean, but I do agree that nobody could start
<br>
from scratch now and rebuild in their present form, say, JPL, KSC and JSC,
<br>
the three crown jewels of the US space facility, much less the myriad secondary
<br>
facilities like Goddard, Huntsville and Dryden.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is a wildcard I don't believe you've considered: James Cameron. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He's moving forward on several space projects which are bound to have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an impact on public perceptions. I actually spoke with him briefly on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this, and plan to publish his comments. He wants us on Mars. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe it possible his projects could reinvigorate the manned space 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;program. 
</em><br>
<p>I HAVE considered Cameron and others who suggest that media feed from a
<br>
Mars mission, or a robotic lunar rover or whatnot might finance the undertaking.
<br>
&nbsp;I’ve also read “The Man Who Sold the Moon”.  For a very good recent revisitation
<br>
of the idea, read Greg Benford’s “The Martian Race”, a fictionlization of
<br>
a Cameron-type character’s implementation of a Zubrin-like Mars mission.
<br>
<p>I’m afraid that a media-fueled space program would be even more subject
<br>
to the passing fancy of public attention and enthusiasm than a government-funded
<br>
one.  So we get a one-season spurt in viewers of a “Let’s Go to Mars” “reality
<br>
TV” program.  What happens next year when “America’s Funniest Home Videos”
<br>
starts broadcasting feed from fly-bot cameras in Madonna’s clothes closet?
<br>
<p>Again, it’s not my intention to simply be pessimistic about space development.
<br>
&nbsp;Rather, I think it’s important to be REALISTIC.  Until the community of
<br>
committed space enthusiasts can do it on their own, I think we’re in for
<br>
a period of contraction. Realizing that now and planning for it will be
<br>
much more fruitful than grasping at straws and chasing the echoes of past
<br>
glory.
