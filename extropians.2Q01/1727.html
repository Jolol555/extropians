<p>&lt;&lt; The evidence for this abounds, everywhere you look, companies are getting
<br>
&nbsp;eatten by the little guys with the weapons of open source, open hardware,
<br>
&nbsp;and moores law. Hardware has vastly outrun real peoples ability to use it,
<br>
&nbsp;and a beastly computer is $700 if you really go nuts (my roomie just built a
<br>
&nbsp;box for his mom better then anything I use for 700) &gt;&gt;
<br>
My guess is that you will not go broke in investing in what Wall-Streeters 
<br>
call high tech stocks, which simply means that they are referring to computer 
<br>
manufacturing of hardware, software, importing, and retailing. Notice that 
<br>
biotechnology is almost always set in a separate category, related almost 
<br>
exclusively to pharmaceuticals.
<br>
<p>Having said that, one would have to study which electronics technology 
<br>
company appears to be a decent bet, being prepared to sell and reinvest as 
<br>
needed. The old retailing trades and industries you have mentioned in your 
<br>
entire post, certainly have been whacked, down, dozens of times over the last 
<br>
130 years; agriculture and metals industries, in particular. Wearable 
<br>
computing, such as souped-up PDA's, so popular in Japan, are an example of 
<br>
the changes and opportunities to come. My guess is that for the next 3 
<br>
decades, computing as we see it today will simply evolve into the background, 
<br>
but will still produce high dividends. My hope is that biotech and perhaps, 
<br>
non-organic nanotech, might sprout up as the new moneymakers.
