<p>Alternately prayer, or rather addressing the &quot;etheric intelligence&quot;
<br>
would work in a Utility Fog permeated environment or its equivalent.  At
<br>
least it would work within the limits established for the VR or
<br>
environment.  Presumably there are certain parameters to the thing that
<br>
are not to be broken lightly or the purpose of setting it up in the
<br>
first place might be forfeited.

<em>&gt; Perhaps a new religion could be built around the concept that we live in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can be uploaded from our mortal existence, a technological Rapture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who knows, it might even work.
</em><br>
<p>Why appeal to this being when we have &quot;been given&quot; the means to figure
<br>
it  out and upload ourselves?  The answer to such a request would have
<br>
to look like that to keep the parameters of the VR intact most likely
<br>
anyway.
