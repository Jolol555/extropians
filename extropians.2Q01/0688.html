<p>This is what bugs me the most about the Sysop and everything related 
<br>
to it (e.g. Friendliness, etc.).  *My* nanobots are going to create 
<br>
*my* computorium, only to have the Sysop say, sorry, you can't do 
<br>
that because it's not very Friendly, despite the fact that this is 
<br>
still *my* computorium.  In my opinion, most of the problems 
<br>
throughout history stem from the fact that someone else was trying to 
<br>
control resources that don't belong to them and have resulted in a 
<br>
mentality that is detrimental to free society, almost forcing the 
<br>
continuation of the system because most people are not able to think 
<br>
of the best actions they could make if they were free to do so, 
<br>
unless they are throughly re educated.  With SIs, re education should 
<br>
not take much time at all, just a little re coding.  This will be 
<br>
even easier with AIs, who can be designed from the ground up not to 
<br>
learn how to act when someone else is in control of vis resources. 
<br>
Hopefully, most everyone on this list has already accepted that 
<br>
anarchy results in optimization.  With the intelligence of SIs and 
<br>
their speed of thought, common arguments against anarchy (sure, it 
<br>
optimizes, but people are too stupid and too slow for it to work 
<br>
effeciently, which are only half true anyway) are beaten.
<br>
<p>Maybe it comes down to making this choice:  would one rather live 
<br>
free yet at the risk of destruction or inside a cage but safe from 
<br>
all but universe level destruction.  I have chosen the former, but 
<br>
maybe Eliezer has chosen the latter.
<br>
<p>Of corse, either choice is better than what we have now:  a cage with 
<br>
sharp spikes sticking inwards that could kill at any time.  :-/
