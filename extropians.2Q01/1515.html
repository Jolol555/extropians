<p>Eliezer, sometimes you make me smile.  And towards the end
<br>
of winter in Seattle, that usually isn't an easy thing to do.
<br>
<p>However, if the physicists are approaching a complete TOE, or at
<br>
least a sufficiently robust TOE that they can't take it any
<br>
further without recreating a big bang, then even the very
<br>
best cognitive science will not be able to build better
<br>
physicists.  Fundamentally physics is about reducing things
<br>
to a set of simple principles.  Once that has been done
<br>
it becomes useless to try an extract any more from an empty
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>On the other hand the phase space of what you can explore
<br>
in terms of building things based on the laws of physics
<br>
seems phenomenally large!  You really want the cognitive
<br>
scientists to enhance the engineers who in turn enhance
<br>
the cogntive scientists and so on and so forth.  You
<br>
will hit a limit on how much you can explore per unit
<br>
of real time but that exploration will be a very rich
<br>
voyage indeed.
