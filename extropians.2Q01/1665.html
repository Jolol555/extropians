Dear Extropes,
<br>
<p>I know that my evil twin, Spike Jones (*), sent a sweet and supportive
<br>
message regarding my birthday, so I'll say a public  'Thank You' regarding
<br>
his message. Since he mananged to pass through _his_ milestone birthday
<br>
with his goofy self apparently intact, I'll  trust that I'll pass through
<br>
my birthday in a similarly goofy-intact way.
<br>
<p>See: my mood these days:
<br>

<br>
<p>(*) I went through a wormhole on the way out, so my birth was
<br>
delayed 5 months
<br>
<p><p>My birthday unfortunately comes at a time when my current funding
<br>
and my current Germany visa expires and my thesis is due, making my
<br>
life a bit more interesting, but my near-term future in Heidelberg
<br>
at MPI-K as a postdoc looks good (as long as I get my dissertation
<br>
into the university in the next few weeks).
<br>
<p>If you're interested in solar system dust, then you might be
<br>
interested in the following (a synopsis).

<p>IO REVEALED IN THE JOVIAN DUST STREAMS
<br>
by Amara Lynn Graps
<br>
<p>Dissertation to the Naturwissenschaftlich-Mathematische
<br>
Gesamtfakult\&quot;at of Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\&quot;at Heidelberg
<br>
Spring 2001
<br>
<p>The Jovian dust streams are high-rate (at least 250~\kms) bursts of
<br>
submicron-sized particles travelling in the same direction from a
<br>
source in the Jovian system.  They were discovered in March~1992 by
<br>
the cosmic dust detector instrument onboard the Ulysses spacecraft,
<br>
when the spacecraft was just past its closest approach to Jupiter.
<br>
Observations of the Jovian dust stream phenomena continued in the
<br>
next nine years. A second spacecraft, Galileo, now in orbit around
<br>
Jupiter, is equipped with an identical dust detector instrument to
<br>
Ulysses' dust instrument.  Before and since the Galileo spacecraft's
<br>
arrival in the Jupiter system in December~1995, investigators
<br>
recorded more dust stream observations. In July and August 2000, a
<br>
third spacecraft with a dust detector (combined with a chemical
<br>
analyzer), Cassini, travelling on its way to Saturn, recorded more
<br>
high-rate bursts of submicron-sized particles from the Jovian
<br>
system. The many years-long successful Jovian dust streams
<br>
observations reached a pinnacle on December~30,~2000, when both the
<br>
Cassini and Galileo dust detectors accomplished a coordinated set of
<br>
measurements of the Jovian dust streams inside and outside of
<br>
Jupiter's magnetosphere.
<br>
<p>The work in this thesis describes an emerging electrodynamical
<br>
picture of the Jovian dust streams as they appear inside and outside
<br>
of the Jupiter environment. The three spacecraft data show the dust
<br>
streams to be at a much higher rate (``dust storms&quot;) {\it outside}
<br>
of the Jovian magnetosphere, than {\it inside} of the Jovian
<br>
magnetosphere, yet the source of the Jovian dust streams is the
<br>
same. The source of the Jovian dust streams is Jupiter's moon, Io,
<br>
in particular, dust from Io's volcanoes. Charged Io dust, travelling
<br>
on trajectories from Io's location, is shown in this work to have
<br>
some particular signatures in real space, in frequency space, inside
<br>
of Jupiter's magnetosphere, and outside of Jupiter's magnetosphere.
<br>
<p>One key to understanding the Jovian dust stream trajectories in real
<br>
space is the dust particle's {\it variable} charging. If the dust
<br>
particle is small enough, then its trajectory is dominated by
<br>
Lorentz forces. If the dust particle's charge varies during its
<br>
travels, then its Lorentz-force-dominated dynamics vary, as well.
<br>
The dust particle's charge varies via currents generated as the
<br>
particle samples the plasma through which it travels.
<br>
<p>Results from numerical charging experiments here show that the dust
<br>
particle rarely reaches an equilibrium potential as it travels. The
<br>
equilibrium charging times for the dust particles in Jupiter's,
<br>
Earth's and Saturn's magnetosphere are on the order of hours to
<br>
days, therefore the dust particle accumulates more and more charges
<br>
which can dramatically influence its dynamical behavior. Numerical
<br>
charging experiments here also show that the secondary electron
<br>
emission current, which was previously thought not to have an effect
<br>
in the placid calm of the interplanetary solar wind, contributes at
<br>
least +1V potential to the particle's overall potential in the solar
<br>
wind. Dynamical simulations of the dust stream particles using
<br>
variable charging show several interesting effects: sensitivity of
<br>
the particle's dynamics to the harmonic expansion of the magnetic
<br>
field model, and a marked difference in dynamics with only slightly
<br>
changing the particle size, the density, and the secondary electron
<br>
emission current parameters.
<br>
<p>In order to reach some of the speeds that the dust particles
<br>
achieved during the December~2000 joint Galileo-Cassini dust stream
<br>
measurements, the smallest dust particles could have the following
<br>
range of parameters: size: 5-6 nanometers, density: 1-2~gr-cm$^3$,
<br>
initial potential: 1-3V, secondary electron emission yield:  3,
<br>
dependent on a maximum electron energy 300~eV, and a photoelectron
<br>
emission yield: 1.
<br>
<p>The Jovian dust stream dynamics in the frequency-transformed Galileo
<br>
dust measurements show two different signatures, depending whether
<br>
the dust detector is located outside of the Jovian magnetosphere or
<br>
inside of the Jovian magnetosphere. Inside of the magnetosphere, the
<br>
frequency signature is that of {\it amplitude modulation} with
<br>
Jupiter's magnetic field modulating Io's orbital frequency signal.
<br>
Outside of Jupiter's magnetosphere, Jupiter's magnetic field
<br>
signature has disappeared, with Io's orbital frequency remaining as
<br>
the prominent signature. This time-frequency analysis is the first
<br>
direct evidence that Io is the source of the Jovian dust streams.
