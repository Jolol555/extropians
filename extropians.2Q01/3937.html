system
<br>

their
<br>
<em>&gt;web system. You will be able to rate people and hopefully see ratings

both
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Some points of clarification. The beta version is available now. This
<br>
version does not affect the mailing list at all, the ratings are only
<br>
available on the web archive. Also, the ratings apply to the content,
<br>
not the author.
<br>
<p>The web archives are available at
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://forum.javien.com/forum/index.php">http://forum.javien.com/forum/index.php</a>&gt;, and should work with any web
<br>
browser. There is a lag of a few minutes between the mail broadcast and
<br>
it appearing in the archive.
<br>
<p>To rate archived content, you need to install client software (currently
<br>
only available for Windows, Linux is in the works). To register to get
<br>
the client software, go to &lt;<a href="http://www.javien.com/members/">http://www.javien.com/members/</a>&gt;.
<br>
<p>The ratings use collaborative filtering. That is, the recommended values
<br>
that you see will be specific to you. This works by correlating your
<br>
ratings with those of other users. For example, when Natasha rates on
<br>
the basis of adherence to 'the Extropian principles and a variety of
<br>
essays that embody content reflecting the goals, thoughts and feelings
<br>
of &quot;Extropy&quot;', she will then see recommendations for content based on
<br>
the ratings of other users who share that attitude.
<br>
<p>To enter ratings you must create a pseudonymous identity, an &quot;agent&quot;,
<br>
which has a micropayment account associated with it. We are still
<br>
restricting the beta somewhat in that only Extropy Institute members
<br>
will be given money in those accounts. But with this email, we are
<br>
opening it up so that anyone on this list may get the client software
<br>
and try out the rating system, but their account balance will remain at
<br>
zero.
<br>
<p>Enjoy!
