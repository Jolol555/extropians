<em>&gt; [Jim Fehlinger ] ... had dinner with some friends recently, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have two little boys, ages 4 and 6 ... --- The six-year-old got a cup
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a picture of a killer whale on it, whereupon his little brother
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burst into tears.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... he needed a yogurt with a **fierce** animal on it, to maintain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with his brother.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---------------------------------
</em><br>
<p>When one is in contact with very young humans, one is
<br>
constantly reminded of the fact that humans are carnivores
<br>
and a somewhat fierce and murderous species at that.
<br>
<p>When one hears the phrase &quot;the innocence of childhood&quot;
<br>
and its many variants, it was surely uttered by one who
<br>
is seldom in direct contact with actual human children.  It is
<br>
disheartening to learn that in fact it is the adults who are
<br>
relatively &quot;innocent&quot; for adults have learned to suppress
<br>
many of the negative emotions with which evolution has
<br>
cursed humanity.
<br>
<p>Perhaps in our post human incarnation, we will manage
<br>
to become more truly mutually beneficial and benevolent.
<br>
<p>Interesting that this thread should be titled &quot;original sin&quot;
<br>
for that term came into being as a result of Religion
<br>
Incorporated struggling to explain why kids are so
<br>
damn rotten.  spike
