</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In my definition an agnostic is someone who largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holds the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of God to be currently unknowable. As I stated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previously, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;believe that we do not know enough about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe to say with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;certainty that a God does not exist. (an error of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atheists IMMHO)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not so.  Most atheists I've met would not say &quot;god
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't exist&quot;, they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would say they don't believe it exists.  They're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well aware of the problem 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of making such sweeping claims.  By default, atheism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is merely a lack of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; god belief.  It can also be a form of &quot;assertion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonexistence&quot;, but this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my experience is much less common, and atheism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tends to be described 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that way in order to strawman it.
</em><br>
<p>Atheists can indeed say &quot;god doesn't exist&quot;.  For a
<br>
nice, and somewhat lengthy, article on the subject, go
<br>
here:

<p><em>&gt; &gt;I realize religions have pat (unacceptable) answers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Of course a wise person would simply take Pascal's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wager (Blaise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;look it up) and say they believe. Come to think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, I repent!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I don't know whether the &quot;wise&quot; person would:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Then again, a lottery 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ticket is about the level of my betting.
</em><br>
<p>Pascal's Wager is rather silly, not to mention
<br>
hypocritical.  Does someone employing Pascal's Wager
<br>
think that he can trick an omniscient being by
<br>
believing in something &quot;just in case&quot;?  And which
<br>
religion is it that such a person is to believe in? 
<br>
With the thousands of choices available how are you
<br>
going to be sure you've chosen the right one?  You
<br>
can't believe in all of them, as many of them are
<br>
diametrically opposed, and some explicitly condemn
<br>
others.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, for most religions one just can't
<br>
say &quot;I believe&quot; and leave it at that.  One must also
<br>
agree to a certain set of dictates that one must live
<br>
thier lives by.  So, if the Wagerist does decide on
<br>
one particular religious denomination, he risks
<br>
wasting his entire life in servitude to a lie.  Not my
<br>
cup of tea.  :-)
