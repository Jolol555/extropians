<em>&gt; Elizer, Im not up to speed on the state of the art in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neural nets, but I did notice there was not much said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it in recent years after it seemed so promising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12 yrs ago.  Could you give us a one paragraph
</em><br>
<em>&gt; summary on your comment?
</em><br>
<p>No, this was long before then.  I think there was a paper in 1967 and a
<br>
book in 1969, if I recall correctly.  Essentially, Minsky and Papert
<br>
proved that a two-layer Perceptron (which was what a neural network was
<br>
called back then) couldn't compute the XOR function.  Which killed off the
<br>
entire, then-nascent field of neural networks.  Eventually someone noticed
<br>
that a three-layer neural network (with a total of five neurons) could
<br>
easily compute the XOR function and the entire field came back to life. 
<br>
It never lived up to its initial hype but is still thriving today,
<br>
especially those efforts that strive for greater biological realism in the
<br>
networks.
<br>
<p>I am oversimplifying slightly - what really brought the field back was
<br>
backpropagation, which is what enabled the training of multilayer networks
<br>
- but the fact still remains that Minsky and Papert's eulogy was
<br>
incredibly premature and did a lot of damage.  Nothing remotely on the
<br>
scale of Margaret Mead, though.
