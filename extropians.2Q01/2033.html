The government is being naughty again.  Time to revisit
<br>
<a href="http://www.DefendYourPrivacy.com">http://www.DefendYourPrivacy.com</a>
<br>
<p>I haven't seen this on Extropians yet, so...
<br>
<p><pre>
--
<p>What if an acquaintance who worked for an insurance company or
government agency could read the private notes of your psychotherapist,
or find out if you or a family member have ever undergone drug or
alcohol treatment?
<p>Would you want others to know whether you've ever had an abortion or
been treated for an embarrassing disease?
<p>All of those things could happen if a regulation being considered by
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services goes into effect.
<p>I'm participating in an Internet campaign to kill this regulation, and
I'm inviting you to join me.
<p>If we generate enough e-mail, we can bury this awful regulation. But we
need to hurry -- because the it's scheduled to go into effect April 14,
which is just two weeks away.
<p>Please read this short background news item, and forward this message
to any friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, or other people you know
who may be interested. Then go to <a href="http://www.defendyourprivacy.com">http://www.defendyourprivacy.com</a> and
sign the petition. It will be submitted directly to your representative
in the U.S. House and to both your U.S. Senators.
<p>BACKGROUND:
<p>By April 14, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson must
decide whether to implement the &quot;medical privacy&quot; rules submitted in
the waning days of the Clinton administration. The rules, published in
the Federal Register on December 28, 2000, mandate that every doctor
and health care provider turn patient records over to the HHS and other
federal agencies for &quot;safekeeping&quot; -- regardless of whether patients
consent.
<p>The government could then share those records with third parties such
as insurance companies, private marketers, and even police agencies.
<p>The result? Soon millions of government bureaucrats, clerks in
insurance companies, HMO's and even drug marketing companies will have
access to your confidential medical records without your permission.  
Specifically, this regulation would:
<p>* Allow the disclosure, without patient consent, of all medical  
records for &quot;public health surveillance activities&quot; and dozens of other
purposes. Providers could refuse to treat people who refuse to
surrender their records.
<p>* Allow private insurance companies to access the medical information
and compile it into a database.
<p>* Permit police agencies to access medical records without a search
warrant.
<p>* Give the government the right to access the private notes of a
psychotherapist.
<p>* Allow foreign government officials to see Americans' health  
records, as long as the U.S. government claims it is doing it for a
&quot;national health purpose.&quot;
<p>*  Assign every American a &quot;unique patient identifier,&quot; whether you
want one or not, by working in conjunction with the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act.  The number would be similar to a
Social Security number for medical transactions - and would make
accessing an individual's medical records as easy as running a credit
check.
<p>* Give direct marketers access to medical records, and allow  
pharmacies to share prescription records &quot;for the purpose of  
marketing health-related products and services&quot; -- all without  
patient consent.
<p>* Prevent patients involved in health research projects from  
accessing their own medical records.
<p>The government claims it is doing this to &quot;protect&quot; the privacy of your
medical records. But if these regulations go into effect, you can kiss
your medical privacy goodbye.
<p>In a free society, the government has no reason to have copies of your
private medical records, and politicians have no right to release your
medical records to others without your consent.
<p>But that's exactly what's going to happen, unless we can generate
enough opposition to persuade Congress to stop these regulations from
going into effect April 14th.
<p>Please forward this e-mail to any friends, family, co-workers,
neighbors, or other people you know personally who may be interested.
However, please don't send it indiscriminately; spam will only hurt our
campaign.
<p>Then go to our web page (<a href="http://www.defendyourprivacy.com">http://www.defendyourprivacy.com</a>) and sign the 
petition. Thank you.
