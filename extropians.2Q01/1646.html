<p><em>&gt; I guess the &gt;H position would be that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - we want to be able to control emotions (we are control freaks)
</em><br>
<p>I disagree a bit with the (joking) wording. We are *influence* freaks
<br>
rather than control freaks. We don't need to control every single
<br>
little subsystem and make it behave as we want in every moment in
<br>
time, but if we want to affect it, we should be able to do so. As we
<br>
put it at TransVision 98: we don't need total weather control, just
<br>
enough influence to make sure it doesn't rain on the picnic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  - Killing oneself is not a Transhuman ideal, except perhaps if you've lived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10K+ years and are getting bored. Keeping people alive through what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely a transitory phase is a Good Thing (tm).
</em><br>
<p>In transhumanism human life is assumed to be worth living. 
<br>
<p>Although there are some tricky complications here with human autonomy
<br>
and integrity when we might want to help someone who for the moment
<br>
doesn't want to be helped.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Humans are mere chemicals. I'm made of mere chemicals, which in turn are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just boring old atoms, and those in turn quarks (oh the banality).
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am nothing and nobody; atoms that have learned to look at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves; dirt that has learned to see the awe and the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;majesty of the universe.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Geoffrey A. Landis, Winter Fire
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Happiness is not the supreme state for extropians, in particular.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would expect that (unattainable) fulfillment is. None of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian principles would require happiness; in many cases, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drive required to reach them comes from massive discontent coupled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with optimism; not happiness.  Realising one's dreams could involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the full range of &quot;negative&quot; emotions, and potentially end in great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sadness. Happiness is cows in green pastures, and we like to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we are not they.
</em><br>
<p>I take more of an aristotelian view of happiness. Fulfillment, the
<br>
reward after finishing something, is nice, but it is the road there
<br>
that produces the real benefits. I think Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi put
<br>
it well in _Flow_, suggesting that we feel truly happy and grow as
<br>
persons just when we exert ourselves in the right way while reaching
<br>
towards our goals. Our drives may differ, but it is easier to achieve
<br>
happiness when striving for something positive rather than being
<br>
driven by negative drives.
