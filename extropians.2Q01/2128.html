<p>&quot;Peer anchored the soles of both feet and the palm of one hand firmly
<br>
against the glass, and rested for a while.  He tipped his head back to
<br>
take in, one more time, the silver wall of the skyscraper stretching to
<br>
infinity above him.  Cotton-wool clouds drifted by, higher than any
<br>
part of the building -- even though the building went on forever.
<br>
<p>He freed his right foot, reanchored it higher up the wall, then turned
<br>
and looked down at the neat grid of the city below, surrounded by
<br>
suburbs as orderly as ploughed fields.  The foreshortened countryside
<br>
beyond formed a green-brown rim to the hemispherical bowl of the Earth;
<br>
a blue-hazed horizon bisected the view precisely.  The features of the
<br>
landscape, like the clouds, were 'infinitely large,' and 'infinitely
<br>
distant'; a finite city, however grand, would have shrunk to invisibility,
<br>
like the base of the skyscraper.  The distance was more than a trick of
<br>
perspective, though; Peer knew he could keep on approaching the ground
<br>
for as long as he liked, without ever reaching it.  Hours, days,
<br>
centuries.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Peer had been exhausted when he'd stopped, but after a minute's rest
<br>
he felt, literally, as energetic and enthusiastic as ever.  Back in
<br>
cloud-time, preparing himself, he'd edited out any need or desire for
<br>
food, drink, sleep, sex, companionship, or even a change of scenery,
<br>
and he'd reprogrammed his exoself -- the sophisticated, but nonconscious,
<br>
supervisory software which could reach into the model of his brain and
<br>
body and fine-tune any part of it as required -- to ensure that these
<br>
conditions remained true.  He resumed the descent gladly, a happy
<br>
Sisyphus.  Making his way down the smooth mirrored face of the skyscraper
<br>
was, still, the purest joy he could imagine:  the warmth of the sun
<br>
reflecting back on him, the sharp cool gusts of wind, the faint creak
<br>
of steel and concrete.  Adrenaline and tranquility.  The cycle of
<br>
exertion and perfect recovery.  Perpetual motion.  Touching infinity.&quot;
