<p>I **knew** somebody was going to say that.  I picked something
<br>
off the soc.motss quote page that's apropos:
<br>
<p>In theory, there is no difference between theory and
<br>
practice. In practice, there is.
<br>
&nbsp;-- Muffy Barkocy
<br>
<p>However, the argument's gone a bit off the rails here, in that speed
<br>
isn't the **whole** story.  Your original question was (paraphrasing)
<br>
&quot;what the hell does high-plasticity, or evolvable, hardware have to do with
<br>
making an AI?&quot;.  Here's my take on this (my standard disclaimers apply here --
<br>
I don't have Eliezer Yudkowsky's brains, Eugene Leitl's degrees, or
<br>
Damien Broderick's seriousness of purpose in keeping up with the field in
<br>
order to write books about it [not to imply that Eugene and Damien don't have
<br>
brains, or that Eugene and Eliezer don't have seriousness of purpose, or...
<br>
well, you get the idea!]).
<br>
<p>**If** you buy the selectionist arguments of Edelman, Changeux, et al.
<br>
about the basis of intelligence in animal nervous systems (maybe
<br>
you do, maybe you don't, or maybe you haven't thought about it; but
<br>
that's where I'm coming from, just so you know ;-&gt;), then there's something
<br>
special going on in biological brains (and bodies; they're really not
<br>
separable in this model) that cannot be simplified away (and it's nothing
<br>
mystical -- Edelman himself pooh-poohs Penrose's invocation of quantum
<br>
mechanics, or what Edelman calls &quot;exotic physics&quot;).  This &quot;something
<br>
special&quot; -- competition and selection among the members of very large and
<br>
stochastically-varying sets of active elements (read the authors for
<br>
a better description) is probably accomplished directly in &quot;hardware&quot;
<br>
in animal brains.  As much **stuff** as there already is in the human
<br>
brain, if you're going to replace this squishy hardware substrate with
<br>
what Eliezer would (figuratively) call a more &quot;crystalline&quot; hardware substrate,
<br>
and **simulate** all that dynamic whoop-de-do in software (utilizing
<br>
some source of randomness to provide the variability among
<br>
the competing elements -- this is what it makes it different from
<br>
a Turing machine, sez Edelman), then that more regular and static
<br>
hardware substrate is going to have to have even **more** &quot;stuff&quot; in
<br>
it (I don't know how many orders of magnitude, but more than one,
<br>
I'd guess) than the already-stuffed biological brain does (just like
<br>
a CD player has to have more stuff in it to do basically the same
<br>
thing that an analog LP record player does).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think you understand the problem fully...
</em><br>
<p>See above.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It ain't gonna be silicon, I can tell you that...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What then?
</em><br>
<p>I don't really know.  Eugene Leitl probably has a more informed
<br>
opinion about this.  Fullerene nanotubes have been getting a
<br>
lot of press lately.  Diamondoids out of Drexler have been
<br>
mentioned.  Maybe biological tissue -- if it can immortalized,
<br>
though I know some sort of (literally) crystalline gizmo has more
<br>
psychological appeal for a lot of body-hating techno-nerds
<br>
(like me!) -- like those crystals that everything on the
<br>
planet Krypton is made out of in the Superman movie (I
<br>
just bought the DVD ;-&gt;).  It would be nice to be able to
<br>
use something that can survive harsher environments (like
<br>
deep space) better than biological tissue can, and also
<br>
something that could be made to operate at higher speeds.
