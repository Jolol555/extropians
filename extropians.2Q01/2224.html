<em>&gt; &gt; Salon offers a review of &quot;Black and White&quot; that describes it as not just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computer game but as *at least* the best of a new and compelling art form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and, perhaps, as something like training for godhood.
</em><br>
<p>Having played it, I'm going to have to disagree.  Maybe it'd be an
<br>
introduction to some of the concepts, but it is *far* too limiting an
<br>
interface.  You have a certain set of actions you can do (move and
<br>
rotate around, pick stuff up and throw or drop it, cast &quot;miracles&quot;,
<br>
tell your creature to go somewhere, pet or slap your creature, direct
<br>
your creature when in combat to attack/block/cast/move, and click on
<br>
signposts and scrolls), a set which is extended a bit by what you do
<br>
them to (for instance, dropping a tree either plants it or supplies its
<br>
wood to a building, and you can forcibly convert nonbelievers by
<br>
dropping them near one of your villages' abodes if that abode has room
<br>
for another occupant).  It is all very finite, and things do not
<br>
improve much over time.  I would at least expect to be able to give
<br>
the villagers more complex directions - unless the villagers were
<br>
dumbed down to make the relative intelligences match, given as the
<br>
players are only human.  Plus, there are numerous technical glitches
<br>
(most annoying: when trying to drop a nonbeliever for conversion, even
<br>
if you leave the hand cursor still for a second - the prerequisite to
<br>
changing &quot;toss&quot; to &quot;drop&quot; - if you drop on the wrong place, the
<br>
villager is still thrown around) which further limit what can be done.
<br>
<p>God is supposed to be infinite.  Frankly, with enough money
<br>
(tithes/taxes from my subjects, perhaps?), I could be more powerful in
<br>
real life today than the god in the game is.  (Satellite cameras give
<br>
me the same view; food and building materials can be bought and
<br>
delivered easily, while political influence and private armies are
<br>
merely a bit more difficult; weapons far more devastating than a
<br>
fireball are on the black market, maybe even legal markets; et cetera
<br>
and so forth.  *And* I can be a lot more precise and creative in
<br>
application.)  Granted, I don't actually have that much capital (yet),
<br>
but it is still dissapointing to see a &quot;good&quot; portrayal of God come off
<br>
as more limited than the minor &quot;miracles&quot; I do create.
<br>
<p>Maybe I have impossible expectations, given the nature of what this
<br>
computer program really is: a bunch of precoded statements, with
<br>
evolvability added in as a feature in order to ensure that the game
<br>
stays within a safe sandbox (for instance, these villagers' women get
<br>
pregnant through hugging and kissing, and no amount of in-game change
<br>
will alter that), while my kind of godhood implies no ultimate sandbox.
<br>
But, if it's going to get hyped as the best god game out there with no
<br>
limitations, then why limit my desires?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hmm.  On the usenet computer strategy group it's described more as training
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *parenthood*.  You have to teach your worshippers and your &quot;creature&quot; (a kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of agent).  The problem is, they start very stupid and you have to do a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of things like potty-train your creature and teach it not to eat beach balls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (no, I'm not kidding).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not personal experience, but that's a major part of what gets discussed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very amusing to read, but doesn't sound very &quot;godlike&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>God-as-parent.  It's not just that they start stupid, it's that they
<br>
forget stuff at a moderately fast pace, so they remain stupid.  The
<br>
best one can do is to spend a large amount of attention to make them
<br>
temporarily slightly less stupid.  Frankly, if you play any particular
<br>
level for too long, your villages use up all the wood on the island and
<br>
grow so large that you have no choice but to ignore their needs - which
<br>
the game regards as inherently &quot;evil&quot;, despite the game's premise that
<br>
you're supposed to be able to be good or evil.  (Unless the lesson is
<br>
that the only way to be good is to use people then abandon them to
<br>
their fate ASAP, without caring for their long term prospects so long
<br>
as they're happy and alive when you leave?)
