<p>Hm.  Well, I understood it perfectly.  Therefore, you should take this
<br>
into account in deciding whether or not the paper makes sense, unless you
<br>
don't think we have common priors.
<br>
<p>Essentially, Robin's paper gives a rigorous mathematical proof that for
<br>
two people to (a) disagree and (b) maintain their disagreement after
<br>
interaction, one or both of the parties must believe that they are more
<br>
likely to be rational than the other person.  This does not necessarily
<br>
prove irrationality in *all* cases but it proves irrationality for *most*
<br>
cases.  If we take into account the evolutionary-psychology arguments,
<br>
Robin's paper makes a strong case for a built-in irrationality factor
<br>
common to all humans.
<br>
<p>If a 100,000:1 genius is interacting with a 10,000,000:1 genius, but
<br>
neither of them knows the other's percentile, both will rationally assume
<br>
that they are more likely to be rational than the other person.  However,
<br>
Robin's paper does prove that in *most* cases, rather than in the rarer
<br>
instances where two geniuses unknowingly interact, people must be
<br>
overestimating their own rationality relative to others, or else must not
<br>
be using rigorous Bayesian reasoning with respect to what they are
<br>
licensed to conclude from their own thoughts.
