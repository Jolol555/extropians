I'm getting my weekly fix of Science (treekiller, check out <a href="http://sciencemag.org">http://sciencemag.org</a>
<br>
for the recycled electrons, but it's not for free) while bahning to work. This 
<br>
stuff gets more potent with each new batch, either they're cutting it less, or 
<br>
it hits me harder, I don't know which. (Yes, I get a kickback from them
<br>
for me pimping it).
<br>
<p>Anyway, they jacked up superconducting temperature of buckyballs to 55 K,
<br>
and theory says aligned buckys should do lots better, and the best way
<br>
of aligning them seems to enclose them in buckytubes, peapod style. Theory
<br>
predicts room temperature superconduction, but don't expect to haul too
<br>
much over it (hey, I only want to do logics, you can keep all the power
<br>
applications to yourself, rendering artificial reality is cheap).
<br>
<p>Another whopper is detection of matter signatures just it waves a final kiss
<br>
to this universe, and to disappear below event horizont final curtain.
<br>
Cool 140 Hz, while whipping around a 60 km object, then waving buh-bye, and 
<br>
poof! Never to be seen again. The best thing is that we don't have anysuch 
<br>
object at our doorstep. Whew. Even not mentioning looking down the polar 
<br>
jets, the accretion disk alone is mightily bright.
<br>
<p>Another one, three deep (okay, not so deep) space probes leaving this
<br>
system in different directions show significant slowing down over theory. 
<br>
Either there's still unknown uneliminated dirt going on, or we have the 
<br>
first actual data that we're missing a TOE (we knew that before, but it's 
<br>
actually nice to see that we've now have it on hard drive).
<br>
<p>More of above cool stuff, just in the case of a few days (okay, I did let
<br>
it pile up a bit). As I said, the world is going completely bananas, and no
<br>
one seems to give a damn. That's the only thing which truly amazes me.
<br>
<p>What next, intra/interspacetime portals? Sorry, forgot, we already had that
<br>
last week. Looking forwards for the next one. I hope it's not going to
<br>
become much more interesting as this, I'd hate scrapping my plans for the
<br>
rest of my life.
