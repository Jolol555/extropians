</em><br>
<em>&gt; As the Buddha says in Hesse's _Siddhartha_, which I recommend all on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list read, [his] doctrine is about overcoming suffering -- not truth.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but Buddhism, particularly the overcoming suffering bit,
<br>
isn't a 'religion.' This is not a supernaturalist claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But truly the problem is with linking the idea of overcoming suffering
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; faith.
</em><br>
<p>Again, no problem with overcoming suffering, we all try to do
<br>
this, no &quot;faith&quot; required.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still, I don't argue with people about religion, especially people who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; older than their early 20s for the most part because those people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; settled and it takes to much time and effort to convince them to change.
</em><br>
Go
<br>
<em>&gt; for the young!
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that these older 'committed' christians &amp; suchlike are
<br>
putting far more effort into their propaganda than are the
<br>
non-supernaturalist &quot;voices of reason&quot;.  Agreed, religion should not be
<br>
indoctrinated in young either at school or by parents ... but how do we
<br>
counter the big money push for religious conversion. It is far too much
<br>
trouble to argue wirth them rationally because (as previously posted)
<br>
religiousity is about emotion, and not rationality.

</em><br>
<p>I think we should offer a strong, &quot;posthuman&quot; alternative rational
<br>
belief-set that DOES satisfy the emotional and social functions that
<br>
religion once offered .... my particular view is that only MVT can
<br>
offer this alternative ... although PSYCHOANALYSIS might be
<br>
another alternative (not mutually exclusive with MVT of course).

<em>&gt; I think you're making my point. The Taliban is NOT representative of
</em><br>
Islam,
<br>
<em>&gt; though you might think that from the news we get. (Keep in mind the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction of statues by Christians, and wonder if that is representative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Christians you know.)
</em><br>
<p>No, but all the religious beliefs are basically incompatible with
<br>
each other ..... and furthermore there certainly is a long history
<br>
of image-bashing (Henry VIII reformation) as well as book-burning
<br>
by Xtian sects throughout history. They are certtainly no better
<br>
than Islam.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;      We were discussing how a significant portion of the world's
</em><br>
population
<br>
<em>&gt; might respond to certain technologies, and how we might find out what
</em><br>
their
<br>
<em>&gt; thoughts are. I simply made a point about politeness, and then get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responses based on things I didn't say, and on misperceptions based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faulty reporting. You don't have to agree with their religion to
</em><br>
understand
<br>
<em>&gt; the power they have. You might think Islam is primitive but telling
</em><br>
Muslims
<br>
<em>&gt; that, while discussing how they feel about technology would certainly stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the conversation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      The technologies needed to fulfill the things most extropians want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (life-extension, AI, etc.) are VERY controversial, and are constantly
</em><br>
being
<br>
<em>&gt; threatened with being made illegal. Countering those threats will take an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort, and some of the things people have been saying seem more aimed at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making sure NO ONE listens to us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. Access to media is vital.

<em>&gt; Excellent point!  Go for the fence sitters -- not the people who have deep

</em><br>
<em>&gt; forget the rest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I tend to think most of these types are among the young, though.  I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware of Graham's hierarchy...  But I reckon as most people get older they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are less amenable to philosophical change.  This has been my experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Think of when most people are intellectually active -- teens to early
</em><br>
20s.
<br>
<em>&gt; After that, most people have a worldview and don't change it much before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death.)
</em><br>
<p>It is true that children are more susceptible to hypnosis to adults on the
<br>
whole ... but nevertheless, *everyone* is suggestible and can have their
<br>
opinions changed, and the change of mind might be more lasting in an
<br>
older person.
<br>
<p>Once the *facts* (of Darwinism, or that in early evolution we lost our
<br>
pineal, primal, sens commens eye at the time of the cold to warm-
<br>
blooed interface .. and gained REM and internally generated, symbolic
<br>
mentation as a result) are known, it is very difficult indeed to unknow
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>Takes a while to replace the older, religious paradigms though ... after all
<br>
they have a 2,000 odd year start on Darwin.
