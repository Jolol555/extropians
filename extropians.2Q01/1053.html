<p>Matlab is expensive and waaay overkill for what I have in mind.
<br>
It does have some cool features, but really all I wanted to do was
<br>
make up a spreadsheet to help people do some first order calcs
<br>
on something like a pre-singularity pre-nano Mars/asteroid
<br>
colonization scenario.  I can tell from some of the comments
<br>
that are posted to me off list every time I start mentioning my
<br>
single tiny female Martian meme, that many do not really understand
<br>
what is involved.  I get these very incensed notes:  spike, you
<br>
cruel wicked bastard yakkity yak, and spike, you heartless mad-
<br>
scientist misogynist bla bla.
<br>
<p>Well, I can assure you Im none of the above, but this is all a
<br>
very straightforward calculation, and we could put together
<br>
a very convincing no-magic-physics linked spreadsheet to
<br>
prove it.  It would be a good tool for those wanting to put
<br>
together a pre-nano hard-science-fiction story.  Thats all I
<br>
have in mind.  If we do it right, it could grow from a Mars
<br>
colony sheet to one that includes interstellar flight with
<br>
solar sail/nuclear rocket tech, etc.
<br>
<p>Altho I still agree with Gene that open source is best, I
<br>
would be willing to use microsloth excel as an intermediate
<br>
step, from which we could later extract the equations for
<br>
a more sophisticated later effort.   spike
