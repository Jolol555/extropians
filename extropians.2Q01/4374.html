<p>&lt;&lt; Superluminal travel, but no automation in battle. Monkeys
<br>
&nbsp;frozen in slowtime as flies encased in amber. No telepresence. 
<br>
&nbsp;No augmented reality. No robotics. Antiquated communication 
<br>
&nbsp;technology, yet no relativistic lag. Almost bare-handed 
<br>
&nbsp;handling of antimatter. Nanotechnology, but still people 
<br>
&nbsp;around. Nanotechnology, but ridiculously stupid, brittle 
<br>
&nbsp;computers. Moronic SOPs. Inconsistent treatment of existing 
<br>
&nbsp;technologies. Random regression from one episode to another.

&nbsp;Here today, and gone tomorrow, substituted by another shiny

Ah! Eugene! Thee has the first sign of thee Vulcan Mating Fever. Thee blood 
<br>
burns Eugene, Thee eyes burn, Its Amok Time for you, fella!  
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Diagnosis: not a technology forecast but just space opera 
<br>
for monkeys. Doing lots of harm by scrambling (especially
<br>
young) people's expectations of what is physically possible, 
<br>
and what is not, what is easy, and what is hard. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Have you noticed that in the science fiction pulp mags, as well as books, its 
<br>
scarcely much better? The printed word isn't so expensive like silicon 
<br>
graphics special effects are, hence the Trek &quot;cosmos&quot; stuff is always a 'work 
<br>
around,' and has always been thus. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Recommendation: Producers of the series to be the first
<br>
to be put up against the wall, come the revolution.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Producers, being full members of the privileged class, will probably control 
<br>
the nanotech revolution, Eugene, as Drexler hinted at. Power comes to money, 
<br>
most times.
