<p>OK.  This is something that should go with our proposed
<br>
public domain extropian software project, starting perhaps
<br>
with Adrians ion engine model.  We could post equations and
<br>
a read-me file on how to do orbit mechanics.  It really really
<br>
isnt complicated at all.  We could even post rules of thumb,
<br>
such as it takes as much delta vee to change an orbit 90
<br>
degrees as it took to get it in orbit to start with.  And it
<br>
scales linearly, so if you are in an 8 km/sec orbit, it takes
<br>
4 km/sec delta vee to change that inclination by 45 degrees.
<br>
<p>Assuming we have plenty of time to change that orbit,
<br>
we still need to come up with a buuuunch of delta vee.  spike
