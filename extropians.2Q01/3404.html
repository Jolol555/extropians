<p>
I decided to investigate the cloning-ban bills a bit further to see
<br>
if the people posting and the press were quoting things properly.
<br>
<p>If you go to:
<br>
<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/c107query.html">http://thomas.loc.gov/home/c107query.html</a>
<br>
and enter the Word/phrase &quot;cloning&quot;, you get a number of
<br>
related bills, and in particular H.R.1644.IH and S.790.IS.
<br>
<p>Reading the text it looks like what they are trying to prevent
<br>
is several things:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) human asexual reproduction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(which clearly gets into a reproduction rights issue
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for unpartnered individuals such as myself)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the high miscarriage rates and potentially children
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with genetic defects likely to be associated with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;somatic nuclear transfer technologies.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(but of course to really reduce these you need to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outlaw sex completely since human miscarriage
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rates are already high (perhaps 60+% of conceptions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've heard quoted), and of course each of us has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5-10 genetic &quot;defects&quot;, so you could argue they are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taking away the reproduction rights for some couples
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that new technologies are enabling).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) use of the 'cloning' process to produce human tissues or organs.
<br>
<p>Now, (c) is the one above that I would be most concerned about.
<br>
But in thinking a bit more, I don't think it is much of a show
<br>
stopper.  Growing a complete human for an organ bank or a new
<br>
body for a brain transplant is going to require we figure
<br>
out how to (a) stop a brain from developing and (b) keep the
<br>
body alive long enough to grow it to an adult stage.  I don't
<br>
see the information &amp; technologies to do that developing
<br>
anytime in the near future.  Alternately, you could want to
<br>
use the technology to grow a single organ rather than a whole
<br>
body, but this is going to require that you know all the
<br>
cellular signals to flip to send the embryo in that limited
<br>
direction.  That information is accumulating rapidly but it
<br>
is probably going to be available for stem cells long before
<br>
it is available for embryonic cells.  I suspect the zebrafish
<br>
genome project will need to be complete and a lot of work
<br>
on developmental biology will be required before we are able
<br>
to manipulate embryonic cells the way we currently manipulate stem
<br>
cells (if there are significant differences between them which
<br>
is a debatable point).  My guess is that robust information in
<br>
understanding the signals involved in all the various tissue and
<br>
organ development paths is probably 5-10 years out, in contrast by
<br>
that time we should be able to make stem cells sit up and beg for dinner.
<br>
<p>Now, what the bill does not prohibit, which is important, is
<br>
research into the understanding of the molecular signals
<br>
that allow the development of an &quot;egg&quot; cell or the signals
<br>
that the egg uses to cause the reversion of differentiated
<br>
cell into an embryonic cell (thats the real magic IMO).
<br>
<p>One might be able to make an interesting argument that
<br>
in those cases where nuclear transfer into eggs is successful,
<br>
that the source cells are pseudo-stem cells.  The original
<br>
methods used intestinal cells and the cells at the bottom
<br>
of the crypts in the intestine are effectively intestinal stem
<br>
cells.  So it may be that the cases that don't work are
<br>
when you get a nucleus from a terminally differentiated cell,
<br>
while the cases that do work are when you get a pseudo-stem cell.
<br>
If so, this means there will be lots of room for improvement in
<br>
these methods once we can reliably identify pseudo-stem cells.
<br>
That will knock the reliability leg out from under the position
<br>
the bill takes.
<br>
<p>If the pseudo-stem cell scenario is accurate, then dedifferention
<br>
isn't really occuring when these methods are used and it means that
<br>
&quot;adult&quot; stem cells should work perfectly fine for growing
<br>
all the organs (or babies) we want.  The signals that direct the
<br>
growth and differentiation processes are rapidly being understood.
<br>
A large fraction of the genes that produce the various signals
<br>
have been in the databases of HGS, Incyte, etc. for 5-6 years,
<br>
and there were recent articles in Science on clever &quot;transformations&quot;
<br>
that can be used to direct stem cells into differentiated cells that
<br>
produce insulin.  They've turned other types of stem cells into
<br>
neuronal cells and muscle cells I believe.  What the general public
<br>
(and politicians) don't seem to understand is that each and every cell
<br>
in an adult contains the complete blueprint for manufacturing another
<br>
human if we can figure out how to flip the correct switches.
<br>
<p>Now, how they will modify the bill when it becomes possible
<br>
to turn any adult cell with pseudo-stem-cell characteristics
<br>
into a totipotent embryonic cell (permitting asexual reproduction
<br>
without the need for an &quot;egg&quot;) will be interesting question.
<br>
Given the difficulties in obtaining &quot;eggs&quot; (to my knowledge they require
<br>
some nasty hormone treatments and a surgical procedure to get them), it
<br>
is clear that for the lowest cost methods, one wants to eliminate
<br>
that part of the process, so there is a fairly large incentive for
<br>
scientists to work on this.
<br>
<p>I don't see the bills on preventing &quot;cloned&quot; people from entering the
<br>
U.S. as one typically doesn't &quot;import&quot; people.  It would potentially
<br>
ban the importantion of &quot;cloned&quot; organs.  So sending your cells
<br>
offshore to be grown into an organ and then importing them back
<br>
into the U.S. seems out.  But going offshore to get the organ
<br>
implanted and then entering the country seems possible.
<br>
<p>Now, as pointed out in the previous article I mentioned --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel041601.shtml">http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel041601.shtml</a>
<br>
it appears they are attempting to regulate cloning under
<br>
the &quot;interstate commerce&quot; powers granted to the Federal
<br>
government by the constitution.  So it is questionable
<br>
whether the law would stand up to a court challenge.
