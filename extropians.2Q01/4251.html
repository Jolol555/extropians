As for cryonics, well, ahem, why not?
<br>
<p>I'm not sure it's the economically most interesting way to promote
<br>
one's genes, memes, or whichever eternal things we wish to promote
<br>
about us &quot;selves&quot;. Which raises the question of identity:
<br>
what are &quot;we&quot;? What is &quot;I&quot;? What am I striving for and toward?
<br>
<p>A few things To take into consideration:
<br>
(1) we can promote these genes and memes beyond our individual life
<br>
by spreading them the &quot;usual&quot; ways through heredity and civilization.
<br>
(2) even with cryonics, life expectancy is finite, so we even with it,
<br>
we have to consider eventual use and comparative risk/payoff for
<br>
these former methods, too.
<br>
(3) life expectancy through cryonics depends on one being conserved,
<br>
despite the repeated violence that greedy people disrespecting one's
<br>
property might exert for centuries during which one is not there to
<br>
consistently defend it and adapt, until technology is not only much
<br>
much advanced than it is, but also not so much advanced as to make
<br>
the kind of individual resurrection to happen that one can afford
<br>
a kind that will the resurrected one a lone animal in a zoo, watched
<br>
with a mix of contempt, indifference and bemusement by much superior
<br>
transhumans. This can make the risk*(payoff-cost) integral quite small.
<br>
<p>Of course, what's great about individual liberty
<br>
is that we all bet for our own lives, and
<br>
are ultimately responsible to our &quot;selves&quot;, whatever they be,
<br>
for what we do toward the outcome that we desire for them.
<br>
Life on the evolutionary scale is the ultimate free market.

Tolerance is not about believing that stupid people are intelligent,
<br>
it's about letting stupid people be victims of their own stupidity
<br>
rather than being victims of yours.
