<p>Bloody hell, you are *everywhere*
<br>
<p>Hah, at least my memory works  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And, some time later, I find out that the same Paul Hume wrote Shadowrun.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, I only played it once or twice (never really played much in the way of RPGs) so
<br>
I'm not really up on who wrote what. Shadowrun seems to be well-regarded amongst RPG
<br>
players.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  He's had a tech career and is active in the Ordo Templi Orientis and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; online. You can readily find him in a few places online, like the Thelema93
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Right, okay. I didn't have much to do with him, the high magic people weren't really my
<br>
thing, but it was interesting to read their stuff  :-)
<br>
<p>What happened to PODS? Is it still about? I was Y Ddraig in the various echoes. I tried
<br>
to see if it was gated to the net when I first got online, couldn't find it, and forgot
<br>
about it over time.
