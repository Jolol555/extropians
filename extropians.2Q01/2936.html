<p>In Weird Math of Choices, 6 Choices Can Beat 600
<br>
<p>By ERICA GOODE
<br>
<p>Choice is good. And the more choices, the better.
<br>
<p>This simple American credo lines the shelves of grocery stores with
<br>
162 varieties of breakfast cereal, turns ordering a cup of coffee at
<br>
Starbucks into an Olympic challenge, makes selecting a phone company
<br>
an enterprise requiring a business degree and supplies dating services
<br>
with an endless stream of hopeful customers.
<br>
<p>It also underlies the way many economists think about human behavior.
<br>
Human beings, according to traditional economic theory, are rational
<br>
creatures who, faced with a choice, weigh the costs and benefits of
<br>
each option and pick the one they prefer. And the more options people
<br>
are given, the theory goes, the more satisfied they will be.
<br>
<p>Yet in an article published last month in The Journal of Personality
<br>
and Social Psychology, two social psychologists dispute this view,
<br>
arguing that at some point, multiplying the number of alternatives
<br>
people are given becomes counterproductive.
<br>
<p>In a series of studies, Dr. Sheena S. Iyengar, an assistant professor
<br>
at Columbia's business school, and Dr. Mark R. Lepper, chairman of
<br>
Stanford's psychology department, have demonstrated that providing too
<br>
many options particularly when the differences between them are small
<br>
can make people feel overwhelmed and overloaded, and as a result, less
<br>
likely to buy or pursue any of the options available.
<br>
<p>Research subjects who were asked to select from an extensive array of
<br>
alternatives, Dr. Lepper and Dr. Iyengar found, were less satisfied
<br>
with their choices, found the choices themselves less attractive, and
<br>
felt more frustrated and regretful than other subjects who were given
<br>
only a limited number of options to choose from.
<br>
<p>&quot;One can go too far in the process of offering choices,&quot; Dr. Lepper
<br>
said, &quot;and when we are confronted with an array of choices that is
<br>
larger than we can manage, it has negative effects.&quot;
<br>
<p>While an abundance of research demonstrates the benefits of having
<br>
options, Dr. Lepper said, the new studies are the first to rebut the
<br>
notion that the human desire for and ability to handle choice is
<br>
unlimited.
<br>
<p>Dr. Edward L. Deci, a professor of psychology at the University of
<br>
Rochester who studies human motivation, said that &quot;having more than an
<br>
optimal number of options is not necessarily a motivating factor, as
<br>
these studies have nicely shown.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It's very important for people to have choices, to be able to decide
<br>
what's meaningful for them,&quot; he added. &quot;But you can get overloaded
<br>
with it, just as you can anything else.&quot;
<br>
<p>In one of the studies reported in the journal, a group of subjects
<br>
were asked to choose which type of chocolate they would buy from a
<br>
selection of 6 Godiva flavors. Another group was asked to choose on
<br>
variety from among 30 different flavors.
<br>
<p>Subjects who were given extensive choices found the chocolates they
<br>
had selected less tasty, less enjoyable and less satisfying than did
<br>
the subjects given limited choices. They had more regrets about their
<br>
choices and they were less likely to choose chocolates as compensation
<br>
for taking part in the study than were subjects whose field of choice
<br>
was restricted.
<br>
<p>In another study, the researchers set up a &quot;tasting booth&quot; at
<br>
Draeger's Supermarket in Menlo Park, Calif., an upscale grocery store
<br>
known for its wide selection of foods. (On a normal day, Dr. Iyengar
<br>
and Dr. Lepper report, Draeger's features &quot;roughly 250 different
<br>
varieties of mustard, 75 different varieties of olive oil and over 300
<br>
varieties of jam.&quot;)
<br>
<p>When shoppers approached the booth, some found a selection of 6 types
<br>
of jam to taste; others encountered a choice of 24 different jams.
<br>
<p>The wider selection, Dr. Lepper and Dr. Iyengar found, attracted more
<br>
shoppers: of 242 customers who passed by, 60 percent stopped at the
<br>
tasting booth, compared with only 40 percent of the 260 customers who
<br>
passed the more limited display.
<br>
<p>But while nearly 30 percent of the shoppers given 6 choices
<br>
subsequently bought a jar of jam, only 3 percent of those offered 24
<br>
varieties made a purchase.
<br>
<p>&quot;Even though consumers presumably shop at this particular store in
<br>
part because of the large number of selections available,&quot; the
<br>
researchers wrote, &quot;having `too much' choice seems nonetheless to have
<br>
hampered their later motivation to buy.&quot;
<br>
<p>They added that &quot;these findings are striking,&quot; and they &quot;appear to
<br>
challenge a fundamental assumption that having more, rather than fewer
<br>
choices is necessarily more desirable and intrinsically motivating.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Lepper said he was inspired to carry out the studies in part
<br>
because of his experience with Stanford's retirement plan. When he
<br>
first started teaching at the university in 1971, Dr. Lepper said,
<br>
Stanford offered only two investment options, one in stocks and one in
<br>
bonds.
<br>
<p>&quot;Nine or 10 years later they offered a third choice,&quot; he said. &quot;A few
<br>
years later, it got up to five choices. And then they hired a new
<br>
benefits group, who were great believers in cafeteria plans, and
<br>
suddenly we had 157 options.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Lepper added, &quot;My sense was that this was way more choice than
<br>
anybody here wanted.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Barry Schwartz, a professor of psychology at Swarthmore College
<br>
who has written on what he refers to as &quot;the tyranny of freedom,&quot; said
<br>
that in his view the proliferation of options in American life was
<br>
often felt as a burden. &quot;I think that we sort of worship at the idea
<br>
that people should have as much freedom and autonomy to choose as they
<br>
can,&quot; Dr. Schwartz said.
<br>
<p>But in many ways Americans these days have nothing but autonomy.
<br>
<p>&quot;We have a choice of where to live, what kind of work to do, when to
<br>
marry, whether to marry, when to have children, whether to have
<br>
children, whether to be straight or gay,&quot; Dr. Schwartz said. &quot;But when
<br>
there are 100 options out there, you have no one to blame but yourself
<br>
if you choose badly. And I think the combination of the escalation of
<br>
expectations and this self-blame are both the result of a multiplying
<br>
of options, and they can have devastating effects.&quot;
<br>
<p>In his own work, he said, he is studying the differences between
<br>
people who are &quot;maximizers,&quot; viewing each choice as a challenge to
<br>
find the very best option, and those who are &quot;satisficers,&quot;
<br>
approaching a choice as a search for any option that meets some
<br>
specific set of criteria.
<br>
<p>For a satisficer, Dr. Schwartz said, a wealth of choices is not a
<br>
problem, since the task is merely to find one that works. &quot;But if
<br>
you're a maximizer,&quot; he said, &quot;the more options there are, the more
<br>
overwhelming it is.&quot;
<br>
<p>In recent years, at least a few manufacturers have picked up on the
<br>
idea that endlessly increasing consumers' options is not always an
<br>
effective strategy.
<br>
<p>In the early 1990's, for example, Procter &amp; Gamble reduced the number
<br>
of varieties and sizes of Head and Shoulders shampoo from 26 to 15.
<br>
The shampoo's market share increased as a result, according to a
<br>
representative of the company.
<br>
<p>Still, as Dr. Lepper noted, many studies make clear that having a
<br>
choice is better than not having choice at all.
<br>
<p>Preschoolers offered a selection of magic markers, for example, draw
<br>
better pictures than those told which markers to use. Grade school
<br>
children asked to choose the projects they want to work on turn in
<br>
work of higher quality than those given no choice. And giving people
<br>
options, a host of studies show, can also increase their life
<br>
satisfaction, the degree to which they feel internally motivated, and
<br>
how much control they perceive themselves as having.
<br>
<p>In some cases, it also pays to have as many choices as possible, Dr.
<br>
Lepper said. If 1,000 people go into a library looking for something
<br>
specific to read, for example, the more volumes there are on the
<br>
shelves, the better. And the more entrees there are on a restaurant
<br>
menu, the more chance people have of finding what they like to eat.
<br>
<p>In such situations, said Dr. Lepper, &quot;We know exactly what we want,
<br>
and this gives us the opportunity to match it. Up to the point that it
<br>
gets cumbersome, we're going to prefer to have more choices.&quot;
