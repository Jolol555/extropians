<p>&lt;&lt; Marlow's Axiom of the Long Term: All talk of a long-term contains an 
<br>
&nbsp;unwarranted assumption and is therefore unduly optimistic. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Define long-term, in a practical sense. Is 500 years too soon for Star Trek 
<br>
level technology, 5000 years, 50,000 years, or 5 million?  There are 
<br>
certainly maturation's of technologies, which either produce plateaus of 
<br>
capability, as well as slow and fast evolutions of capability. Revolutions 
<br>
tend to be fewer and farther between. We need some guides, some examples, to 
<br>
help us properly measure what is achievable and what it will take to gain 
<br>
that achievement. In an Aristotelian sense we need something that is neither 
<br>
the fantastically, optimistic &quot;hand-waving&quot; of magazine peddling journalists, 
<br>
nor the vituperative, pessimism of the leftists and anti-tech sociopaths.
