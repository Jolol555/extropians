<p><em>    &gt; The problem is that we can make predictions that apply outside particle

</em><br>
<p>Yes but only when you look at the radioactive isotopes of potassium ; I don't
<br>
know about you but I haven't done that in, gee, it must have been days.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Everywhere we look these rules  are being followed

<p>But what about far more numerous places we haven't looked?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; To know in advance all possible consequences of a simplification to the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; rules and know that will produce no contradictions implies a knowledge
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; of the future incompatible with a sim.
</em><br>
<p>Is there any reason to think that our world contains no contradictions?
<br>
We probably wouldn't recognize such a thing anyway, we'd just say
<br>
there must be some new physical law we don't understand yet, or call it
<br>
another manifestation of quantum weirdness.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Something with infinite computation can't think, for example, it's
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;already thought of everything.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that's true but even if it is  so what, that's it's problem not ours.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Besides, infinite computation is  about a magic as such things get.
</em><br>
<p>True beyond doubt, but maybe magic exists. And you're right, we probably face a
<br>
Dysonian end-game and not the sort of climax to the universe Tipler describes,
<br>
but there might not be any deep logical reason for that, it could be pure chance,
<br>
such as the fact that 9 planets circle the sun. There is nothing special about the
<br>
number 9, other stars have a different number of planets and perhaps other
<br>
universes are closed making infinite computation possible.
