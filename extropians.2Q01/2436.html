Hi
<br>
<p>not getting too heavily into this thread, but years ago I was heavily involved in a
<br>
FIDO-like system called P.O.D.S. (Pagan and Occult Distribution System), and one of the
<br>
main heavyweights in the ceremonial magic areas was a certain Paul Hume (I may be
<br>
getting the name wrong, anyway), who everyone else deferred to as A Person Of Authority.
<br>
<p>A while later (this was about 1990 or so) I was playing a game called Shadowrun, and
<br>
was slightly weirded out as to how well written the magical aspects of it were. Seemed
<br>
that the people involved had done more than the usual 10 minutes' research on magical
<br>
and occult practices.
<br>
<p>And, some time later, I find out that the same Paul Hume wrote Shadowrun. Small world.
<br>
<p>Anyone know what he has done since Shadowrun?  I miss the discussions on PODS, but I
<br>
discovered the internet, which of course meant the end of my BBS activities.  :-)
<br>
<p><p>Dwayne
