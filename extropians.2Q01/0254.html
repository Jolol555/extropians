<p><em>&gt;An informal survey of a law firm where a friend of mine started work last

<em>&gt;weren't professionals.  
</em><br>
<p>This certainly isn't true in my firm, which is among the largest in the US.  
<br>
Without doing any sort of formal review of the data, but based on 18 years of 
<br>
personal experience, I'd say the figure is probably about 50%.  This probably 
<br>
varies somewhat from firm to firm, based on &quot;institutional culture&quot;: Some 
<br>
firms will tend to have &quot;personalities&quot; that are more welcoming to diversity 
<br>
in different ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In general, amongst the lower socio-economic groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(whether white or otherwise), you'll find that very few children will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eventually enter into the professions (or sciences for that matter).
</em><br>
<p>Based on my experience, I don't think &quot;very few&quot; is justified, but certainly 
<br>
a smaller percentage than one would expect if the kind of social and personal 
<br>
mobility you're discussing were randomly distributed.  As it turns out, in 
<br>
the legal profession in the US, the competition for talent is so intense that 
<br>
&nbsp;the economic or educational background of a candidate's parents per se is 
<br>
irrelevant to hiring and promotion decisions.  The &quot;great filter&quot; is the 
<br>
candidate's own academic performance and personality.  Because of the hunger 
<br>
for diversity in large firms like mine (something we've developed because 
<br>
we've come to realize that diversity is an element of creativity in our &quot;firm 
<br>
culture&quot;, which is an economic value that goes straight to our bottom line), 
<br>
qualified candidates from traditionally &quot;disadvantaged&quot; backgrounds end up 
<br>
having somewhat greater opportunities than those who come from &quot;professional&quot; 
<br>
family backgrounds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As an aside, consider the following. Typically, the pure sciences and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematics don't pay as well as law and medicine, and tend to have a lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;status in society. Show me a well-to-do mathematician, and I'll either show
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you a mathematician with wealthy familial support, or a mathematician who's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;become a financial analyst.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If one wants to make a career out of science, then a PhD is an absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prerequisite. PhD's take time - and lots of it.  And you need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;top-notch to actually carve out a career, whereas a so-so degree in law
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;medicine will still (almost) guarantee a reasonable income over ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lifetime.  Combine these two facts, and avoiding the sciences appears, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me, to be a perfectly rational course of action if you're concerned with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making a living.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My wife has an MS in biochemistry, but will soon be graduating in law and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;starting work in an IP firm.  Why? you may ask.  Answer this question, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you'll have the answer: if you've got two equally interesting vocations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you could move into (and both of which you enjoy), but one tends to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;substantially more, which would you choose?
</em><br>
<p>All of which is true, which is one reason I think it would be nice to develop 
<br>
ways for folks to be able to both do science and make more money.  The recent 
<br>
trend toward creating university commercialization vehicles that allow 
<br>
academic scientists to reap more economic rewards from their work is a very 
<br>
good trend, IMO.
