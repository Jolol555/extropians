I don't find this argument very persuasive, but FYI:
<br>
<p>Here is the final report of an NSF conference on &quot;Societal
<br>
Implications of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, NSF&quot;:

<p>On pages 146-147 one finds:
<br>
<p>SOCIETAL IMPACTS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION AND MEDICINE
<br>
V. Vogel, University of Washington
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Science fiction rather than reality: The popular press has often aired 
<br>
heated discussions
<br>
by the author Ray Kurzweil and others about the idea that it will soon be 
<br>
possible to scan
<br>
the human brain and essentially transfer its neural activity to a computer 
<br>
designed to
<br>
simulate billions and billions of human neurons (Kurzweil 1999). This 
<br>
fantastic thought
<br>
is based on a series of assumptions, some of which are reasonable 
<br>
extrapolations of future
<br>
technological abilities. Others, however, completely neglect how little is 
<br>
still known
<br>
about how the mind works. Imaging technology may indeed reach microscopic
<br>
resolution, which may reveal individual synaptic contacts between nerve 
<br>
cells. If Moore’s
<br>
law can be extrapolated, computers will achieve the memory capacity and 
<br>
computing
<br>
speed of the human brain by around the year 2020. Computer experts were 
<br>
therefore
<br>
quick to postulate that copying the 3D neural circuitry of the human brain 
<br>
would become
<br>
possible with these powerful computers and advanced imaging technologies. 
<br>
Once this
<br>
is achieved, they claim, it will be possible to simulate first the brain 
<br>
and its function and
<br>
eventually the state of the human mind, complete with its memories, 
<br>
emotions and
<br>
creativity. But it is important to remember that these nightmarish 
<br>
scenarios are put
<br>
forward without any real biological understanding of the brain. For 
<br>
example, these
<br>
scenarios rely on the assumption that the brain is nothing more than a 
<br>
hard-wired neural
<br>
network, and that knowledge of the 3D brain architecture would be 
<br>
sufficient to assess its
<br>
functional states. This may be the case for nematodes — the worm C. Elegans 
<br>
has a
<br>
nervous system consisting of 302 neurons whose connections are all known (White
<br>
1986). But the brains of higher vertebrates have fundamentally different system
<br>
architectures than computers. Furthermore, single neurons are highly 
<br>
nonlinear systems.
<br>
Single neurons in the cerebrum can make more than ten thousand connections 
<br>
to other
<br>
nerve cells. The picture gets even more complex with the recent findings 
<br>
that higher
<br>
vertebrate brains show plasticity. Plasticity is the ability of a system to 
<br>
change its
<br>
structure and/or function in response to injury, the environment and/or 
<br>
other changing
<br>
conditions (for further readings see Jacobs et al. 2000; Malinow, Mainen, 
<br>
and Hayashi
<br>
2000; Poldrack 2000; Simos et al. 2000; Tramontin and Brenowitz 2000). 
<br>
Given this
<br>
complexity of the brain, a scan of the brain will not allow a read-out of 
<br>
the human brain’s
<br>
mind nor its memory. A century ago, society was embroiled in an almost parallel
<br>
controversy as to whether the future was completely deterministic and 
<br>
calculable based
<br>
on Newtonian mechanics. It took the discovery of quantum mechanics to defy 
<br>
the notion
<br>
that our future is predictable.
<br>
<p>Nanobots are often on top of the list of nanotechnological creations that 
<br>
cause deep
<br>
concern to the public. Eric Drexler and followers postulate that it will 
<br>
soon be possible to
<br>
create nanoscale, addressable robots that have the ability to move in 
<br>
space, recognize the
<br>
environment and self-replicate (see e.g., Stix 1996 for a critical review). 
<br>
Will it indeed be
<br>
possible to create another form of life at the nanoscale? When it comes to the
<br>
engineering of nanoscale machinery, nature is still far superior in its 
<br>
ability to integrate
<br>
synergistically operating nanoscale systems of high complexity. Yet, even 
<br>
nature has not
<br>
been able to engineer nanoscale creatures that combine all of the 
<br>
above-mentioned
<br>
attributes of nanobots. Viruses are amazing nanoscale systems, but even 
<br>
they do not have
<br>
the finesse of the hypothetical nanobots. Viruses are able to move and they 
<br>
contain the
<br>
genetic blueprint of themselves, yet they are not capable of 
<br>
self-replication. Since they
<br>
depend on the replication system and protein synthesis machinery of much larger
<br>
organisms, namely micro-scale cells, they do not meet the definition of a 
<br>
self-replicating
<br>
system. While mankind is equipped with increasingly powerful tools to 
<br>
manipulate living
<br>
systems, we are not at the verge of creating herds of synthetic 
<br>
self-replicating nanobots
<br>
that will run out of control and threaten our lives. Future man-made 
<br>
nanosystems will
<br>
certainly be able to perform a variety of functions, but a robot that is 
<br>
proficient in all
<br>
three functions — movement in space, recognition of a chemically complex 
<br>
environment
<br>
and self-replication — will remain the fabric of dreams.
