<p><em>&gt; The problem, Robin, is that, even under your theory, the observed data is

</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... the three-sigma level of a Foresight
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd pick the third possibility.  Foresight Gatherings do show *some*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvement.
</em><br>
<p>Some perhaps, but not enough to give great hope about a six-sigma group.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But anyway, let me see if I can predict the general reaction to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper's abstract:
</em><br>
<p>The *general* reaction is probably &quot;huh?&quot;; &quot;what's for lunch?&quot; :-)
<br>
So I'll presume you mean some set of especially intellectual folks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;... your paper does not ... change to my underlying model, in which *I* am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the sparsely distributed rational people.&quot; ... the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact of *observing yourself* to think up this particular counterargument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not license you to conclude that you are rational. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;My experience in the Korean War enabled me to stop being self-deceptive&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, ... An external observer, though, is likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to abstract away the idea of an extra added underlying cause and see all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proffered excuses as identical, or belonging to the same class ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this way, we finally arrive at a situation in which some observers may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason themselves into a corner from which *no* utterance allows you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclude that a party is not being silly, even if that party is really and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truly Not Silly.  ...
</em><br>
<p>I have hope that the situation is not quite this bad.  As I hinted at briefly
<br>
in
<br>
the paper, we do have a number of reasonable candidate objective signs
<br>
of self-deception.   Let you and I first look at third parties, and find signs
<br>
<p>which indicate which of them are more or less self-deceived.  *Then* let
<br>
us apply those signs to ourselves to see which of us is more self-deceived.
<br>
<p>Yes, if your self-deception is flexible and foresighted enough, it might
<br>
anticipate which signs will make you look good and bias your evaluation
<br>
of third parties.  Which is a good reason to defer to other people's
<br>
research on self-deception and its signs, rather than favoring your
<br>
own spin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... Even an actual genius, if she comes out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and says &quot;I am a genius&quot;, will be plugged into a Bayesian prior that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimates a million-to-one chance for genius and a ten-to-one chance for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-overestimation, producing an estimated prior of 100,000:1 that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaker is an overconfident fool.
</em><br>
<p>This gives a glimpse of just how different it might be to live in a world
<br>
of mostly meta-rational posthumans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... I also find that Robin Hanson's more recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; papers bear a remarkable resemblance to concepts that appear in &quot;Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI&quot;.  Since self-deception and stupidity generally allow for arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors to creep in, the fact of convergence probably implies that one or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both of us is getting smarter and less self-deceptive.
</em><br>
<p>Or just converging on the same path of error.  Let us hope that like
<br>
families, every disfunctional mind is disfunctional in its own
<br>
unique way. :-)
