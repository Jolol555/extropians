<p>Well, that's the most impressive thing I've yet heard about nano.  It's 
<br>
still ages and ages from anything singularity-inducing.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I think that's very premature, given that we can do *neither* universal,
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course it's premature, I wouldn't be saying that in a paper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's just my personal, private opinion. Nevertheless, if I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the nanotechnology field, I know what I'd be working on right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now.
</em><br>
<p>Perfectly logical.  Lots of worthwhile stuff to do apart from trying
<br>
to induce a singularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; We do need mpsrn for the nanoSanta which will solve all our problems.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I've stopped beliving in Santa (he was called Ded Moroz back
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then) when I was a small kid. Why should I start believing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into him now?
</em><br>
<p>I've no desire to change your opinion substantially.  But some people here
<br>
seem to think there's a singularity at our doorstep, and that entails
<br>
nanoSanta, AISanta, or bioSanta.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; given Moore's law, I think it's *possible* that human-equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; AI could be created in 20 years or so.  I wouldn't bet the bank on
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Given that the state of the art in software development doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;move visibly, and that the complexity bareer still exists, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't see how anybody could hope to sit down, and explicitly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;write down an AI.
</em><br>
<p>Neither do I .  IMO, it'll need some serious self-organization and 
<br>
genetic algorithms.  *If* it's possible in the near future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; doorstep.  That's my concept of practical optimism; there are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lot of great things under development; things can improve over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; next 20 years and more after that.  It's counterproductive, however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to *expect* very improbable miracles; it'll throw off your discount
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rate.  You'll end up doing suboptimal stuff.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Um, that's me, 'gene here. You're probably talking to somebody 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;else.
</em><br>
<p>I *was* hoping you weren't the only one reading this.
