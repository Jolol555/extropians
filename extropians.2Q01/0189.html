<p><em>&gt;&gt;Britain, Australia top U.S. in violent crime
</em><br>
<p>We've been through this before. The page says, e.g.:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Amazingly, armed robberies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                have climbed nearly 45 percent. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                In the Australian state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                Victoria, gun homicides have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                climbed 300 percent. 
</em><br>
<p>Amazing! 300 percent! Who would want to live there?
<br>
<p>There are two towns near here. Freetown has a policy where people dash
<br>
across the street whenever they like, and drivers may run them down if they
<br>
feel like it. Last year, 1010 people were killed crossing the roads in
<br>
Freetown, a rise of a mere one percent over the previous year, negligible
<br>
really.
<br>
<p>In nearby Lighttown, traffic is strictly regulated by traffic lights. Last
<br>
year, there was a truly shocking rise of 300% in the number of citizen
<br>
killed! Up from 1 in the previous year.
<br>
<p>There's also that very baroque claim heading the page:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Twenty-six percent of English
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             citizens -- roughly one-quarter of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             population -- have been victimized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             by violent crime. Australia led the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             list with more than 30 percent of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             population victimized. 
</em><br>
<p>What the *hell* are they talking about? People getting rudely jostled in
<br>
queues? Are they counting the huge number of immigrants from brutal wars
<br>
who might claim that in their whole lives they had indeed been `victimized'
<br>
at least once? This might seem inconsistent with:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;the International Crime
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             Victims Survey notes that overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             crime victimization Down Under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             rose from 27.8 percent of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             population in 1988, to 28.6 percent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             in 1991 to over 30 percent in 1999 
</em><br>
<p>but still that might be some sort of cumulative figure. Now it's true that
<br>
I contributed to one of those data a few years ago when my bike, chained
<br>
outside the local library, was stolen. I never got it back. Very
<br>
irritating. But I ain't never been killed in no drive-by shooting, bro.
