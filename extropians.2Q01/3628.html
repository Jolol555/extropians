<p><em>&gt; No, I hadn't heard of buckysprings.  I think it indicates how far we are

</em><br>
<p>They're not just springs. They're linear actuators. They protract when
<br>
you apply an electrical potential, due to Coulomb forces, and pull 
<br>
back due to attraction of (weak, short-range) van der Waals forces 
<br>
between the concentric graphite sheets, within few 10 ns. That's 
<br>
right, there's not much mass to move, so even little forces acting 
<br>
over short periods of time move stuff *fast*.
<br>
<p>Think of them as telescoping tubes with a regulation knob. By 
<br>
tweaking the knob and thus applying the voltage, you can 
<br>
regulate the protraction amplitude. Very fast, very elegant.
<br>
<p>The main point is that a common chemical you can produce in kg
<br>
quantities in a statistical process contains components which
<br>
can be used as nontrivial parts for a molecular machine. I sneered
<br>
at C60. Silly molecule. No good for nothing but structure
<br>
fetishists, who drool over anything even slightly sexy
<br>
geometrically. I become interested, when it exibited a
<br>
rich chemistry. I become rather interested, when buckytubes entered
<br>
the scene. I'm now getting more and more impressed by graphenes
<br>
by the year, and since recently by the month. This class of molecules
<br>
has such a richness to it, it might be enough. Reactivity dependant 
<br>
on curvature, resulting in being useful for highly inert ducts. 
<br>
Mechanical properties to rival diamond. Thermal conductivity to 
<br>
give diamond a good whacking. Ballistic electron transport over micron
<br>
distances. Metal, semiconductor or isolator, dependent on chirality
<br>
and doping. Can tolerate absurdly high current densities and field
<br>
strenghts without going up in wisps of smoke. Transistor action
<br>
demostrated in T-junctions. Processing of nanotubes by current
<br>
pulses demonstrated. Mechanical manipulation of nanotubes by 
<br>
proximal probe demonstrated. A certain company from Texas does nifty
<br>
6DOF manipulators for buckys. Buckys are superconducting.
<br>
Buckys are highly sensitive to adsorbed material. Buckys sing,
<br>
dance, and throw confetti. Buck nekkid buckys win the sexiest
<br>
molecule of the decade award.
<br>
<p>And I'm not tracking the field that closely. That's just a random
<br>
list.
<br>
<p>So it's good for structural material, logics, ducts, mechanosynthesis.
<br>
Did I already mention that I was highly impressed by graphenes?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think that's very premature, given that we can do *neither* universal,
</em><br>
<p>Of course it's premature, I wouldn't be saying that in a paper.
<br>
It's just my personal, private opinion. Nevertheless, if I was
<br>
in the nanotechnology field, I know what I'd be working on right
<br>
now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; nor even broad, mechanosynthesis *and* that all mechanosynthesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires decidedly macro machinery.
</em><br>
<p>Of course they're macro, we're in an early bootstrap phase yet.
<br>
The next step would seem to use the smallest MEMS you can get,
<br>
and hybridise it with invidual molecules, and try what you could
<br>
build next. It is important to realize that there is no sharp
<br>
boundary between MEMS and NEMS, they are a continuum. We already
<br>
have MEMS parts which resonate mechanically at quite a few MHz.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We do need mpsrn for the nanoSanta which will solve all our problems.
</em><br>
<p>I've stopped beliving in Santa (he was called Ded Moroz back
<br>
then) when I was a small kid. Why should I start believing 
<br>
into him now?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nifty new computers would be nifty new computers but they won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build houses for everybody on earth.
</em><br>
<p>You're of course aware that the Bradbury/Forste/Leitl faction
<br>
would recommend you to not become too attached to the ground
<br>
under your feet. We'll try to be very civil, but. Ahem. Excuse
<br>
me, but you're standing on my planet. Would you kindly move
<br>
aside?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We have created computers which can do some very limited parts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human thoughts, such as voice recognition.  For this reason,
</em><br>
<p>Very lousy voice recognition. Very very bad machine vision. In fact 
<br>
I need reliable machine vision right now for a project of mine, and
<br>
I can't get it. It still bungles, and requires manual intervention.
<br>
It sure saves lots of manual works, but it needs a monkey in 
<br>
attendance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; given Moore's law, I think it's *possible* that human-equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI could be created in 20 years or so.  I wouldn't bet the bank on
</em><br>
<p>Given that the state of the art in software development doesn't
<br>
move visibly, and that the complexity bareer still exists, I
<br>
don't see how anybody could hope to sit down, and explicitly
<br>
write down an AI.
<br>
<p>Why are you focusing on a smart entity to create smartness? You 
<br>
don't need that. Evolution is pretty damn stupid, and it did 
<br>
produce us. Weeeel, sure,  we're not thaaaat smart...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it though.  I wouldn't bet the bank *against* it either.
</em><br>
<p>If I was a betting person, I actually would.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This differs from proximate nanotech or significantly mentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhanced people, which I would bet the bank against.
</em><br>
<p>I would also bet the bank against boosted people, but molecular
<br>
circuitry is not very far away. Drextech, now that's lots more
<br>
difficult.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I know you're joking, but there's nothing defeatist in saying progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will go on for some time to come, that we personally won't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obsolete in the next few years, or that nanaSanta's not on our
</em><br>
<p>Next few years? Next few decades, at least.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; doorstep.  That's my concept of practical optimism; there are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of great things under development; things can improve over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next 20 years and more after that.  It's counterproductive, however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to *expect* very improbable miracles; it'll throw off your discount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate.  You'll end up doing suboptimal stuff.
</em><br>
<p>Um, that's me, 'gene here. You're probably talking to somebody 
<br>
else.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If we had machine-phase nanosynthesis or computers that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; write good papers I'd be singing a different tune.  Someday we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably will.  But today we don't.
</em><br>
<p>How about next Friday, 12:03?
