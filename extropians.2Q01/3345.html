<em>&gt;People need to assert their right to asexual reproduction. This is another

I tried to reframe this issue in this way on the BBCs &quot;Talking Point&quot; 
<br>
forum.  Seems they didn't agree, as they never printed it.  No one who 
<br>
contributed on the topic seemed to even remotely see it as a human rights 
<br>
issue.
<br>
<p>I think the main problem is when will the average Joe/Josephine finally see 
<br>
that we are talking about a reproductive rights issue.  If or when they do, 
<br>
the days of any clone-banning laws will be numbered.

<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
