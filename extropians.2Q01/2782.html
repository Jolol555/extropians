<p>Sentient: an entity with the biological potential for abstract thought
<br>
and abstract communication.
<br>
<p>Person: a subset of entities which has the demonstrated capacity for
<br>
abstract thought and communication to the point where (given the right
<br>
training and stage in their lifecycle) they can negotiate with and
<br>
enter into contracts with other Persons.
<br>
<p>Human: a subset of Persons that you and I are potentially capable of
<br>
reproducing (using the traditional equipment) with either directly or
<br>
through our immediate descendants.
<br>
<p>Of course, these are just rules of thumb. I'm sure the bright folks on
<br>
this list can come up with all kinds of wierd exceptions and
<br>
hypothetical scenarios. That's okay, life is supposed to contain
<br>
ambiguity. All I know is that so far these rules have served me well
<br>
in not doing anything that would come back to haunt me.
<br>
<p>As for super/trans/post humans? I don't think I can influence the
<br>
actions of these beings through some kind of sympathetic magic
<br>
consisting of not preying on beings down the food chain from me. If I
<br>
had to interact with a superior being, I suppose I would hope for the
<br>
best and prepare for the worst, as usual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have stepped onto a slippery slope, mein freund--slick with

</em><br>
<p>We all get to choose slippery slopes. Perhaps all the slopes there are
<br>
to choose from are slippery. I like the ones that are visibly slippery
<br>
and don't provide the false comfort of a moral high ground. It's the
<br>
ones who believe in an absolute morality that have done the most harm,
<br>
historically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let us hope the little gray guys do not feel the same about us,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hmm..?
</em><br>
<p>I'm lost, are we talking about lampreys or those big-headed bulging
<br>
black-eyed ones stoners have on their shirts? I'm not worried about
<br>
the grays, it's the Chrysallids that really get under my skin. ;-)
