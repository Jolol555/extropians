<p>&lt;&lt; Nor do I believe that the answer to the possibility
<br>
&nbsp;of eternal boredom is simply to engineer the experience away!

<br>
Is boredom simply the anger or depression experienced by doing the same old 
<br>
thing for a long time? Is it that one becomes weary from not learning or 
<br>
participating in new activities and experiences? Is it lack of stimulation? 
<br>
Is it merely a neural chemical imbalance, and if human personalities are 
<br>
uploaded, would one still experience this same malady? First let us define 
<br>
the problem. I am doubtful a Jupiter Brain will get bored, since there is so 
<br>
much creative work in the cosmos to undertake. This question is like 
<br>
Australopithecus expressing concern for his fellow hominid, Homo Sapiens, 
<br>
&quot;how can you guys live so far from the scavenging grounds, won't you starve?&quot;
