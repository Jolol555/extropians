Where is the next Einstein?

<br>
Professor Lee Smolin, a visiting professor of physics at Imperial College in
<br>
London, agrees that young people find it difficult to explore fresh topics
<br>
because of the expectation that they will join a large collaborative effort.
<br>
&quot;It's true that most of the really original work is done by individual
<br>
scientists,&quot; Smolin says. &quot;But young people feel pressure to work on topics
<br>
that are popular because it will help their career. It's very pervasive. But
<br>
many have a strong character and do survive, although they maybe don't have as
<br>
prestigious a career as their peers. That's a terrible shame. It's hard to
<br>
imagine someone following the footsteps of people such as Roger Penrose, who
<br>
has done pretty much what he wanted to.&quot;
<br>
Smolin has noted an intriguing trend - some hard-up creative minds are relying
<br>
on private patronage from, for example, wealthy science-minded entrepreneurs.
<br>
It is a good match - entrepreneurs who have taken risks themselves have the
<br>
cash and inclination to encourage kindred spirits. An example is the Perimeter
<br>
Institute (PI), a C$100 million (£43 million) theoretical physics institute
<br>
being set up near Toronto, funded by the Canadian businessman Mike Lazaridis.
<br>
The entrepreneur is recruiting physicists known for their daring ideas.
