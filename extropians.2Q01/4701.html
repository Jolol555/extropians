Yes, you experienced culture shock, because the IRC rooms tend to be composed 
<br>
of snerts (sniveling nasty egotistical repulsive teenagers).  The bad thing 
<br>
about IRC in my opinion, is the silence, as the kiddies come into rooms to 
<br>
meet, and end up in private message land.
<br>
<p>AOL, one can meet birds of a feather, at least, but is surely, not worth the 
<br>
mention for most on this, and many other lists. Yahoo, is as vicious as 
<br>
anything on IRC, yet the ignore feature, works wonderfully.
<br>
<p>I have yet to ever see a chatroom that is rigorously, intellectual, or 
<br>
informed, in general. Extropianism has not yet captured the intelligentsia, 
<br>
quite yet, nor have grass roots rooms fared well. This may take more time and 
<br>
much more effort. Perhaps, someone here can open up an IRC chat or one on 
<br>
Yahoo, to fill the bill? People are busy, so keeping such a room sustained 
<br>
might still be difficult. Perhaps we might consider &quot;mini&quot; Extropian 
<br>
conventions, online, in our own chats? People &quot;know&quot; each other from emails 
<br>
and conventions; perhaps doing an online chat 1 or 2 times per month, on 
<br>
weekends, is workable? Or maybe not. I shall let the leaders lead.

<p>&lt;&lt; I didn't quite realize how hostile people could be about these topics

either
<br>
&nbsp;till this last weekend. Years ago back when the web was new, I used to enjoy
<br>
&nbsp;going to IRC and getting on #philosophy channel and listening to the debate,
<br>
&nbsp;and jumping in myself having a great time. It was wonderful. Well, I went
<br>
&nbsp;back and when I got on the channel again, there was a strange silence that
<br>
&nbsp;went on many mins. I then tried to spur things on by trying to discuss the
<br>
&nbsp;recent AI developments I knew about. At once, I was attacked by people...
<br>
&nbsp;Not with arguments, but completely unexpected responses, most saying &quot; &gt;&gt;
