Okay, here is what we really need bad to make micro-sats and microprobes
<br>
feasible: an SSPS: Solar System Positioning System so that space probes
<br>
can easily figure out their position at all times and run their
<br>
navigation routines off that data rather than having to deal with star
<br>
sighting, wasting fuel and/or power on spinning the spacecraft around
<br>
trying to get a reading. I mean, what are we, in the 17th century or
<br>
what? Why are we still using ancient navigation techniques? There should
<br>
be an SSPS satellite in each of the three Earth-Sol Lagrange points.
<br>
This would be a good investment of public money, and its even
<br>
constitutional for libertarians: space is a 'channel of commerce', or a
<br>
'navigable waterway', so the gummint is responsible for maintaining
<br>
their navigability.
<br>
<p>I am currently designing a 180x200x200 millimeter probe bus that will
<br>
use GaAs/GaAnt solar cells fed focused sunlight from 2 inflated 2 meter
<br>
dia. mirrors (theoretical output: 2.99 kW) to power the electric
<br>
thruster of choice. Fuel tank is 150mm dia spherical. Pick your own wall
<br>
thickness, pressure, contents. Maneuvering thrusters will be solid state
<br>
pulse ignition chemical micro-thrusters off-the-shelf. Navigation will
<br>
depend on SSPS to be in place.
<br>
<p>You decide what payload you want and how quickly you want it wherever
<br>
you are going. I figure with this size bus you could deliver a laptop
<br>
sized replicator facility to any NEA within a few months of launch.
