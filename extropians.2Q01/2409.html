<em>&gt; It may be quite a while before we go plugging things into our brains. It's

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and who wants to be stuck with the neuro-jack equivalent of Betamax?
</em><br>
<p>Of course, there are many other possibilities for direct interface that
<br>
do not require neurosurgery.  Using nanotech for linkages without normal
<br>
surgery is one of course.  Another might be some form of deep memory
<br>
sensing and input signalling that is a future outgrowth of the most
<br>
advanced work in field now.
<br>
<p>Input into the visual cortex is not all that difficult or dangerous and
<br>
will be less so a very few years down the road. 
<br>
<p>In the meantime much of the necessary software can be built and field
<br>
tested and many of the benefits can be gained by ubiquitous and wearable
<br>
computing. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meanwhile, we will continue to become less geographical in outlook. People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will do many more things from a physical distance, although the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being far (tele) will drift away, as our communication technology improves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may be working with someone on the other side of the planet, but if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a video conference wall screen, surround sound, and highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated groupware with which to communicate, you are not going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *feel* far. All that's still without considering true virtual environments;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the helmet-gloves-etc full immersion scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you'll find that, by the time we begin to seriously contemplate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct neural interfaces, we'll already be a long way down the path to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete reliance on information systems for most aspects of our lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We'll already have been through multiple security-related crises, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successive steps toward total immersion are made, and the subsequent new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environments are violated. In fact, we've already been through many such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>That is a very good point.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At this point in time, people are moving en-masse from intermittent access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the net, to permanent connection, and are feeling the pain, en-masse,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associated with that. So we see products like firewalls becoming a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream software consumable; Windows XP apparently will come with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firewall built in (scary...). We'll be having a lot more security problems,
</em><br>
<p>Windows XP will also come with software to throttle MP3 production. 
<br>
Death to Micro$oft!
