<em>&gt; Soooo, Samantha, Eliezer and others -- here are some questions:
</em><br>
<p>Bear in mind that I am not a Sysop.  Being a Friendly AI programmer
<br>
doesn't mean that you get to make the rules.  These are my best guesses
<br>
about what the outcome will be under Friendliness, but things like these
<br>
are not programmer-created content.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - &quot;If in your godly SI or sub-SI incarnation, you choose to evolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    forward by creating simulated copies with variations on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    theme (presumably re-incorporating the positive results back
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    into yourself) are those copies entitled to equal clock cycles?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Okay, several oddities here:
<br>
<p>1)  &quot;An SI can only evolve forward, or can efficiently evolve forward, by
<br>
creating entire copies of verself to test modifications.&quot;  That's an
<br>
evolution-thing.  It's possible to imagine results without simulating
<br>
them, and possible to simulate parts without simulating the whole.  For
<br>
minds in general, forking whole copies has to be the least efficient
<br>
method of self-improvement.
<br>
<p>2)  Lee Corbin obviously has no trouble with this situation.  He can fork
<br>
himself, and the new version will have full citizenship rights, but if
<br>
he's really serious in what he says, the less efficient version will
<br>
simply commit suicide and merge resources with the more efficient
<br>
version.  (And not because he planned it that way or installed mental
<br>
coercions in the new copy, which might be illegal; but because he really
<br>
doesn't care.)
<br>
<p>3)  If you create a new citizen, it doesn't necessarily get equal clock
<br>
cycles.  There's probably some kind of Minimum Living Space requirement -
<br>
say, enough matter that you can be a superintelligence running at full
<br>
speed and not run out of disk space until (a) the Big Crunch or (b) the
<br>
New Lands come online.
<br>
<p>MLS might become the basic unit of currency, about equivalent to a modern
<br>
dollar.  If you don't have an MLS to spare, then you can't create a new
<br>
citizen.
<br>
<p>If computing resources are effectively infinite (or rather, indefinitely
<br>
expandable while still being finite at any given point), then scratch this
<br>
part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sub-questions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Are your copies granted &quot;reproductive rights&quot;? (Or are they sterile)?
</em><br>
<p>If they're created with ten MLS instead of one MLS.  Creating an entity
<br>
with the urge to reproduce using only one MLS probably comes under the
<br>
heading of child abuse; probably creating an entity with the urge to
<br>
reproduce requires a thousand MLS, or perhaps a minimum fraction (a
<br>
thousandth) of your own total resources, or something like that.  (As best
<br>
I can figure it, our Solar System should contain billions if not
<br>
quadrillions of MLS for each living Terran at this time.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Are your copies granted &quot;simulation rights&quot;? (i.e. they too can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   create evolving-forward copies that inherit the rights granted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   to their parents).
</em><br>
<p>If they have an MLS to spare.
