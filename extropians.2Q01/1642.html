<p>It always goes this way. The archives contain a lot of copies of this
<br>
discussion, going back millenia (well, in internet time, anyway).
<br>
<p>My parting points on this (unlikely, actually) are the following...
<br>
- We can't even define consciousness usefully, so it's quite certain we wont
<br>
be able to talk about it usefully in any depth.
<br>
- We probably don't need to consider the nature of consciousness as is
<br>
usually meant, in the world of zombies &amp; the inneffable. The Dennett camp
<br>
may not be correct, but we can proceed as if they were.
<br>
- I'm still going to take some convincing before I destructively upload.
<br>
- Robert's earlier definition of consciousness seems to define awareness,
<br>
more correctly, but I'd say its a useful working definition; the kind of
<br>
thing that will move us forward on constructing self-aware intelligence.
<br>
Conscious puddings, on the other hand, wont help much at all.
<br>
- When someone gets a serious AI going, we may be able to start talking
<br>
about this more usefully.
<br>
- I seriously hope that you don't discover that your pudding is conscious
<br>
Robert. After all, by Eli's dogma, you can't eat it then. Or maybe you can?
<br>
That could be very much part of it's natural thought process...
