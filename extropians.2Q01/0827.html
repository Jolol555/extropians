The matter option might be realized by populating the universe with a number
<br>
of human colonies.

&quot;Yes, but there are very strong reasons for thinking that the vast majority

would be created the &quot;energy option&quot;. It's trillions of trillions of times
<br>
cheaper.&quot;
<br>
Obviously. We all know from day one in transhumanism 101 that you can get
<br>
more simulating angels dancing on the head of a pin for less energy than
<br>
real angels. I was simply pointing out that the logic of your argument does
<br>
not require simulation. The argument should turn on the ease of creating
<br>
lots of us and then point out simulation as one alternative. (See below).
<br>
Again, the tendency of some people to get hung up on this premise it might
<br>
be strategically advantageous to note alternate routes to your conclusion.
<br>
(Obviously there is a whole nest of philosophical problems lurking. I don't
<br>
have a problem with simulations but who wants to get caught in the quagmire
<br>
of arguing that we could not be just a bunch of &quot;Chinese symbols&quot; (Searle)
<br>
or externalists' theories of meaning and belief individuation (Putnam et
<br>
al.))?

Actually I am not sure that this is necessary at this stage. If a Jupiter
<br>
size planet went missing around Alpha Centuri then sure we would miss it.
<br>
But, if the posthumans gobbled up said planet 200 years ago, would we be
<br>
able to tell today? So long as they confine their activities to a safe
<br>
distance away we wouldn't be able to tell what they were up to. Perhaps the
<br>
posthumans have set aside a thousand galaxies as protected parkland. I know
<br>
I will.
<br>
<p><p>&quot; I should say something about this in the next version though.&quot;
<br>
Indeed, one way to do it would be to mention the matter version first. And
<br>
then point out that this is a very conservative approach. For the situation
<br>
may be trillions of times worse since for the same energy expenditure the
<br>
posthumans could make many more of us employing simulations.
<br>
<p>&quot;When I said there might be ethical prohibitions to running simulations of
<br>
human lives, what I had in mind was the fact that human life contains so
<br>
much misery.&quot;
<br>
Yes, I see that now. I guess I just hadn't noticed that human life contains
<br>
misery. Actually, I was just thinking of how the Jews in Auschwitz put God
<br>
on trial--demanding that He appear and account for Himself. I guess we might
<br>
imagine that they were putting the programmer on trial. It's pretty clear
<br>
that if there is a Programmer for our universe, he's a real f---ing bastard.
<br>
<p>&quot; I don't think there is anything immoral about creating simulations per
<br>
se.&quot;
<br>
Neither do I. Nor probably do many of the other &quot;Tom Swift&quot; types of this
<br>
list. But I imagine many do. Other things being equal, I hope this is a
<br>
material world and I am a material boy. So, in a sense I suppose our
<br>
creators could be held accountable for not creating for us the best of all
<br>
possible worlds. Also, there may be something immoral about running a
<br>
simulation where the programmer doesn't announce to the subjects that it is
<br>
only a simulation. If this is a simulation do you think we have grounds to
<br>
sue?
