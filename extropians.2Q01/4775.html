<p>The person who pointed this out to me first over a year ago was...
<br>
Eliezer.  Perhaps I misunderstood what he said then, being as I
<br>
am way outta my field of expertise.  I dont even have a field of
<br>
expertise.  More like a lawn of pretty-good-ise.  Or a weedpatch
<br>
of mediocre-ise.  {8^D
<br>
<p>I was asking back then if it would help in the progress of the
<br>
Singularity to encourage massively parallel computing.  That
<br>
would cause jillions of desktop computers to be connected
<br>
and be passing data on a regular basis.  What I understood
<br>
from his answer at the time is that it is practically irrelevant
<br>
whether or not the personal computers are connected in
<br>
that manner, because of the high inherent latency of those kinds
<br>
of arrangements.
<br>
<p>Eliezer, did I misunderstand your comments from that thread? spike
