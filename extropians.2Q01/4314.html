Regarding earlier comments made that computers were beating grandmasters on 
<br>
a regular basis, I searched Usenet archives for the opinions of chess 
<br>
players re this idea, and they seemed to agree that no, generally, 
<br>
grandmasters were not usually beaten  by software. Also, there were many 
<br>
players, usually not the very top players, but very good players, 
<br>
nonetheless, whose *specialty* was beating computers, and that those players 
<br>
almost always beat the computer.
<br>
<p>However, most good players usually lose to the best software, and of course, 
<br>
time, algorithms, and hardware march on....
<br>
<p>One prescient Usenet comment remarked on how a chess tournament was recently 
<br>
won by a computer brought in by the Dutch team, and the poster asked, well, 
<br>
if they can win a tournament using a computer, what's next for the Dutch, 
<br>
winning the Olympics shotput competition by bringing in  a cannon?
