<br>
<p>Folks, Chris raises some excellent points. I'd be really curious to
<br>
see how/whether anybody can answer him, because the flaws he points
<br>
out are rarely addressed from within the left wing, but are glaringly
<br>
obvious from the outside.
<br>
<p>Here are my reasons for not being a leftist.
<br>
<p>I used to be a leftist in high school. What turned me off from it are the
<br>
following:
<br>
<p>1. Every other leftist I met seemed to write off any form of progress as
<br>
a white male Eurocentric world domination plot. Conversely, the few
<br>
Libertarians, Anarchists, and other rebel scum that I met were into sci-fi,
<br>
RPGs, and were willing to speculate about the future history of humanity.
<br>
<p>2. The consensus seemed to converge on &quot;fixing the problems we have
<br>
before moving in new directions&quot;. Since problems expand to fill the
<br>
space available to them, to me this seemed like a recipe for centuries
<br>
of stagnation.
<br>
<p>3. The dominant value seemed to be equality for its own sake and by
<br>
any means necessary. As it turns out, my dominant value is maximizing
<br>
the overall, long-term, species-wide good. As it turns out, these two
<br>
values are at odds more often than one might expect.
<br>
<p>4. Left wing ideology is at its heart an ideology of top-down
<br>
control. Yes, yes, I know, benevolent, egalitarian,
<br>
for-your-own-protection control. I'm not questioning the morality of
<br>
control at the moment. I'm questioning its practicality in a
<br>
civilization as large, complex, and quickly changing as ours is.
<br>
<p>5. Back then, I knew very little about economics, evolution,
<br>
information theory, and most importantly, complexity theory. I think
<br>
that few people will survive exposure to complexity theory with their
<br>
views on social justice intact...
<br>
<p>5. I was not so much a leftist as anti-right wing.  It was obvious to
<br>
me that the right wing was full of racist, classist, homophobic,
<br>
religious zealot assholes deep in the pockets of corporations. I
<br>
thought that the left was the lesser of two evils, which is how they
<br>
recruit a lot of members, I bet. As it turned out, the Libertarians
<br>
are the least of three mediocrities while the left wing is actually
<br>
full of nihilistic, politically correct, control-freak assholes deep
<br>
in the pockets of law firms, labor unions, and foreign interest
<br>
groups.
<br>
<p><p>...really, the main reservation I have left is the research question--
<br>
who's going to fund basic science and other important ventures that
<br>
have delayed payoffs? Watching the growth of the open source software
<br>
community has answered part of the question. Cheaper material and
<br>
equipment costs driven by nanotech may answer another part of the
<br>
question in the future. I'm on the lookout for more answers, because
<br>
we need to develop plans and test them well before It All Goes Down
