</em><br>
<p>OK, this sounds more plausible to me.  Though I'm not a philosopher
<br>
or a historian (and not particularly knowledgeable or well-read in
<br>
either field), I can believe that the explicit notion of &quot;falsifiability&quot;
<br>
is a sophisticated, modern one, stemming from the philosophy of science
<br>
and the explicit analysis of what's today called the &quot;scientific method&quot;,
<br>
and that if theologians are now casting their arguments into these terms
<br>
it's in reaction to the ascendancy of modern science (and has little to
<br>
do with the thoughts and ideas of ordinary practitioners of the faith).
<br>
Nevertheless, it has been very convenient, in circumstances in which they were
<br>
expected to be taken literally, for the sacred texts to have concentrated on
<br>
events that were described in sufficient detail to have been falsified or verified
<br>
when they were purported to have occurred, but which happened in so remote
<br>
a past that establishing what a modern historian or archeologist would
<br>
accept as a persuasive chain of evidence is difficult or impossible.
<br>
Of course, it's precisely the distance from historical events and the
<br>
encrustation of millennia of embellishment that makes these works
<br>
compelling as literature independent of the literal belief which they
<br>
may have lost in some circles (we can still enjoy Charlton Heston splitting
<br>
the Red Sea in Technicolor).
<br>
<p>And yes, if the past suddenly became available in vivid detail, while the
<br>
theologians might be able to weasel their way out of it through some
<br>
sort of well-practiced doublethink, to the mass of ordinary believers,
<br>
the sacred books would simply be -- falsified (I assume you've seen
<br>
_The Light of Other Days_ by Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter,
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812576403/qid=983913722/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/102-1083400-8739317">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812576403/qid=983913722/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/102-1083400-8739317</a> ).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, the point is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that while non-*local*-falsifiability is salient, made-up stories will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to describe a fictional history that would have most certainly been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falsifiable at the point of occurrence.
</em><br>
<p>It's interesting that Stephen Jay Gould harrumphs at the evolutionary
<br>
adaptationists for the same reason -- that while the Just-So stories
<br>
they make up about why the elephant has his trunk and so on may have been
<br>
falsifiable 30 million years ago, or whenever, they are not falsifiable
<br>
today, and are therefore bad science.
