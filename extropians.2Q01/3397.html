Neil Blaikie, commenting on Brian Atkins comments about why
<br>
too much &quot;tact&quot; may be a bad thing, wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How is not being nice or offensive extropic? (Seems more entropic to me.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is your definition of &quot;newbie&quot;? Anyone who isn't exactly like you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And are you serious about trying to convert people? 
</em><br>
<p>The question becomes &quot;What is the investment required to displace
<br>
memes?&quot;  Some people respond well to &quot;nice&quot; reasoned arguments,
<br>
look at them and will gradually come to accept the premises
<br>
and conclusions.  However the information base each of us
<br>
has is very large compared to our I/O bandwidth.  Thus most
<br>
of the reasoning remains behind the Wizard's curtain.  At
<br>
some point in an discussion, argument or debate, you have
<br>
to make a decision that the other individual's reasoning
<br>
is simply incorrect and may be so fundamentally wrong
<br>
that just simply will not 'get' it UNLESS YOU YELL AT THEM.
<br>
<p>There are any number of bright individuals who I can think
<br>
of that fall into this category (Dr. Smalley on nanobots,
<br>
Dr. Vogel on uploading, Ray Kurzweil arguing that intelligence
<br>
will expand at light speed or we are the first species to
<br>
experience the singularity, etc.)  And these are the bright
<br>
and educated people, presumably those who would change
<br>
their minds, should one be able to extract their assumptions
<br>
and demonstrate they are on skakey ground.
<br>
<p>However, most individuals simply accept whatever memes they
<br>
are given, without ever asking &quot;Why do I 'believe' what I
<br>
belive?&quot; or &quot;What if I am wrong?&quot;.  Those individuals have
<br>
a huge investment in holding onto those memes because
<br>
(a) If you are speaking to them, those memes have 'worked'
<br>
to date (i.e. they are alive); (b) You cannot give
<br>
them the 'experience' that your memes could work better;
<br>
and (c) They are usually surrounded by individuals who
<br>
for the most part 'agree' with their memes and so to
<br>
discard them could place them in an outcast position with
<br>
regard to their social network.  The costs of radical
<br>
mind shifts are very high.
<br>
<p>So, for both the educated and less educated people it sometimes
<br>
takes saying &quot;YOU ARE WRONG YOU SILLY DIMWIT!&quot; to get them
<br>
to question their own self-certainty sufficiently to
<br>
setup enough cognitive dissonance to gain an even chance
<br>
of erasing the current meme-set.
<br>
<p>One has to decide whether or not such an approach is likely
<br>
to be effective and that usually depends on the individual
<br>
and the relationship one has with them.
<br>
<p>Of course I would agree that on the Extropian list there
<br>
may be an excess of yelling from time to time.  It would
<br>
be interesting to survey other forums, and even normal
<br>
human conversations (esp. in culturally specific settings)
<br>
to see whether or not our throwing stones level is higher
<br>
or lower than average.
<br>
