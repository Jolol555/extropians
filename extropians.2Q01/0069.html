Via Robert Hettinga of Philodox:
<br>
<p><p>02 March 2001
<br>
<p>CyberCash has failed in its bid to raise the financing for its proposed
<br>
takeover of Network 1 Financial. The companies have instead entered into
<br>
an
<br>
asset purchase agreement under which Network 1 Financial will acquire
<br>
all
<br>
of CyberCash's operating assets and assume all of the company's
<br>
operating
<br>
liabilities. The transaction will be consummated under a Chapter 11
<br>
bankruptcy proceeding in a case commenced today in Delaware.
<br>
<p>It marks the end of a sorry saga for CyberCash, which saw its stock
<br>
market
<br>
value plummet just before Christmas and lost its co-founder and CEO Bill
<br>
Melton following a blazing row with creditors.
<br>
<p>CyberCash will continue to support its existing customer base of more
<br>
than
<br>
27,500 Internet merchants and more than 100,000 software users and
<br>
maintain
<br>
all normal business functions including marketing and sales activities,
<br>
partner marketing programs and completing scheduled enhancements to its
<br>
Internet payment processing service.
<br>
<p>Dan Lynch, CyberCash's chief executive officer, says: &quot;We are making
<br>
this
<br>
move now to ensure that CyberCash's obligations can be satisfied and to
<br>
maximise any residual value for the company's stockholders.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bill Wade, Network 1's chief executive officer, says his company will
<br>
continue to support and provide service to the CyberCash merchant base,
<br>
and
<br>
continue without interruption the key processor relationships that
<br>
contributed to the transaction growth of the CyberCash gateway.
<br>
<p>Completion of the transaction is subject to numerous conditions as well
<br>
as
<br>
approval by the bankruptcy court. The parties hope to consummate the
<br>
transaction in early April.
