</em><br>
<p>Yes, I entirely agree with you.  Foster's performance is what
<br>
gives this movie its legs, for me.  In fact, I'll go so far
<br>
as to admit that I have a bit of a crush on the Foster/Arroway
<br>
persona of this film, even though I'm a gay man (and no, my name
<br>
isn't really Hinckley, and I'm not planning any assassinations,
<br>
Presidential or otherwise ;-&gt;).
<br>
<p>It really is a tribute to Ms. Foster's abilities as an actress
<br>
that she can do blazing intelligence, in _Contact_ (and I guess
<br>
in _Silence of the Lambs_, too) as well as she can do any other
<br>
sort of character -- the feral woman in _Nell_, say.  Though,
<br>
come to think of it, she has been gravitating toward the brainy
<br>
roles, hasn't she? -- _Maverick_ comes to mind (I haven't seen
<br>
_Anna and the King_).
<br>
<p>But it's still an illusion, created by the smoke and mirrors
<br>
of movie-making magic, and Ms. Foster's acting talents (*).  In Foster's
<br>
supplementary audio track on the _Contact_ DVD, she admits not being
<br>
able to memorize all the technical jargon that Arroway has to spout --
<br>
Foster doesn't have the requisite scientific background to have
<br>
a mnemonic framework for that kind of dialog, so she jokes that
<br>
she relied on strategically-placed cue cards a lot more than she's
<br>
used to doing.  Doesn't detract a whit from her performance, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If only there were (more?) women like that in real life...
</em><br>
<p>I actually do know somebody like that in real life.  A mathematician
<br>
who went to Harvard, and stuff.  She doesn't post to the Extropians',
<br>
but she reads it over my shoulder sometimes, so to speak.
<br>
She's even talked about coming to Extro 5 in June, if she can
<br>
work it into her schedule (and arrange for the care of her
<br>
4- and 6-year-old sons).
<br>
<p>Jim F.
<br>
<p>(*) Actors can do amazing things.  I'm still blown away by
<br>
David McCallum's portrayal of a **trans**-human in the old
<br>
_Outer Limits_ episode &quot;The Sixth Finger&quot;.  Of course, having
<br>
a Shakespeare-trained British accent goes a long way if
<br>
you're trying to do superintelligence ;-&gt; .
