&lt;....my problem with the God III is that he is supposed

<p><p>But the consistency of  the axioms seems to be undecidable.
<br>
And that opens the door to Type III (or not?).
<br>
<p>There are axiomatisable theories that are not recursive.
<br>
If we accept the Church Thesis, even the First Order Calculus
<br>
is actually undecidable. That is to say: we cannot determine
<br>
algorithmically whether a logical formula is (logically) valid.
<br>
<p>Btw, if a mathematical statement is neither
<br>
provable nor refutable, should it be considered 
<br>
neither true nor false? 
<br>
<p>Somebody wrote: let us suppose that I have a safe, 
<br>
but nobody knows the combination to. If I tell that the safe 
<br>
contains a gold coin (and it really does contain the coin)
<br>
then I'm telling the truth, whether or not anyone can prove it.
<br>
If it does not contain the gold coin, then I'm not telling the truth.
<br>
<p>Of course: it is possible to describe statements that are 
<br>
either definitely true or definitely false (but whose truth-value 
<br>
is not knowable). It is also possible to describe statements
<br>
that are not either definitely true or definitely false (but in between). 
<br>
<p>Any way R.P. Feynman wrote: &quot;God is always associated with those
<br>
things you do not understand.&quot;
