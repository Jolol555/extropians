<br>
<p><em>&gt;Hmm, suppose I entangle two particles - they become a monad. Then I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entangle more and more particles with each other, and they also join the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;monad (this could for example be the Schrödinger's cat experiment). What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happens when they lose entanglement - does the monad split? Doesn't seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be allowed by your above statements. Presumably all of the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was entangled during the early Big Bang, but it is today not a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt;monad?
</em><br>
<p>If you go from having two monads to having one, then either
<br>
one has ceased to be, its degrees of freedom having been
<br>
assimilated by the other, or both have ceased to be, having
<br>
been replaced by a new one. Since my point in postulating
<br>
monads is to permit realism about such &quot;illusions&quot; as
<br>
persistence of a self over time, I had better favor the
<br>
former interpretation - it's not much use if monads can't
<br>
interact without being annihilated.
<br>
<p>Similarly, &quot;two systems becoming disentangled&quot; under
<br>
this interpretation must correspond to the creation
<br>
of a monad, and a decrease in the complexity of the
<br>
parent.
<br>
<p>I don't have any opinions about how the origin of the
<br>
universe looks in this picture. But there are certainly
<br>
cosmological scenarios which don't start with universal
<br>
entanglement (e.g. &quot;eternal inflation&quot;).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2. The individual self is a single quantum monad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a very complex state. A momentary state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness is a momentary state of the monad that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If my monad is entangled with a spin of an atom, it would have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different state than if it is not entangled. Would you claim it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impossible to entangle my monad without me becoming conscious of it, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is it possible to entangle me &quot;behind my back&quot;? In the second case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there seem to be state information in the monad which does not affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness, and hence the issue becomes what distinguishes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness information in a monad from non-conscious information. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first case seems rather unlikely to me, since one could construct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;devices which acts as a Schrödinger's cat box on my physical brain (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hence on the entangled consciousness monad) while not giving me any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sensory information (because (say) it is sitting on my exposed cortex
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and I don't have a mirror).
</em><br>
<p>Let's distinguish consciousness and self-consciousness.
<br>
(Some people would rather say awareness and self-awareness,
<br>
and would designate only the latter by 'consciousness',
<br>
but for me, consciousness includes any form of awareness.)
<br>
Consciousness without self-consciousness might be found
<br>
in a state of 'pure perception', without any 'reflection'
<br>
present. Such a state could change, and you wouldn't *know*
<br>
it had changed. So it seems your conscious (but not your
<br>
self-conscious) information can be altered without you
<br>
noticing. Whether there's non-conscious information as well,
<br>
I don't know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, why one monad? Why can't I have ten consciousness monads in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parallel?
</em><br>
<p>You could, but it would be crowded. And remember, the evidence
<br>
for monads (until such time as quantum coherence is found in
<br>
the brain in a big way) is the subjective evidence. Do you
<br>
have subjective evidence that there's more than one person
<br>
responsible for your acts or thinking your thoughts?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To my knowledge - I am collaborating with MRI people - no psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effects are observed beside the ones expected from being confined in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;small space in a loud machine and subjected to medical or psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tests.
</em><br>
<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation can affect conscious states
<br>
though, so maybe it's a matter of degree. (On the other hand,
<br>
the TMS effects that I know about, in binocular rivalry, might
<br>
be the result of determining causal inputs to the monad -
<br>
the unconscious preprocessing that's upstream of the Cartesian
<br>
theater - rather than direct intervention.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The states MRI sets up are rather simple, so I doubt they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correspond to your complex states, but they seem rather likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disrupt complex quantum states they couple to. Whether they couple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;depends on how your coherenence is implemented in the brain, but if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;involves electrical fields somewhere - rather likely given the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the brain - then there ought to be a coupling.
</em><br>
<p>Well, my favorite proposal is that the 'quantum numbers of
<br>
consciousness' are winding numbers of currents in the
<br>
microtubules. To change them, an external field would
<br>
have to induce virtual currents with nontrivial topology
<br>
(i.e. currents winding around the microtubular cylinder).
<br>
Below a certain field strength, this wouldn't happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In the end it seems like this model is vulnerable to produce zombies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The MRI would disrupt the consciousness coherence, which would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presumably quickly reform only to be disrupted again in the next MRI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cycle. So personal continuity is an illusion, and memories of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experience are laid down without you being conscious through it all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This seems to imply that there could be decoherent zombies around.
</em><br>
<p>The current Hameroff-Penrose model is a bit like that -
<br>
it has a string of consciousness events, rather than anything
<br>
like a persisting monad. But I'm more interested in working
<br>
out what it would take for the subjective continuity of
<br>
experience to *not* be an illusion.
