<p>The beginning of the thread,
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/1811.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/1811.html</a>
<br>
<p>described an article in the March 10 issue of _New Scientist_ that
<br>
contains an informal description of the work of mathematician Gregory
<br>
Chaitin of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, who is interested in
<br>
randomness and its implications for the rest of mathematics, especially
<br>
the provability of assertions in number theory.  The article mentions a
<br>
number Chaitin defined called Omega which is apparently an embodiment of
<br>
randomness, and other numbers called Super Omegas which exemplify some sort
<br>
of hierarchy of randomness.
<br>
<p>Later posts by Samantha Atkins, Eliezer, and others harrumphed at
<br>
the article, e.g.:
<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/1811.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/1811.html</a>
<br>
<p>The only mention I see in the _New Scientist_ article of anything that
<br>
even looks like the Goldbach Conjecture (not by name) or the Riemann
<br>
Hypothesis (by name) is the paragraph:
<br>
<p>&quot;Take the problem of perfect odd numbers. A perfect number has divisors 
<br>
whose sum makes the number.  For example, 6 is perfect because its 
<br>
divisors are 1, 2 and 3, and their sum is 6. There are plenty of even 
<br>
perfect numbers, but no one has ever found an odd number that is 
<br>
perfect. And yet, no one has been able to prove that an odd number can't 
<br>
be perfect. Unproved hypotheses like this and the Riemann hypothesis, 
<br>
which has become the unsure foundation of many other theorems (New 
<br>
Scientist, 11 November 2000, p 32) are examples  of things that should be
<br>
accepted as unprovable but nonetheless true,  Chaitin suggests. In other words,
<br>
there are some things that scientists will always have to take on trust.&quot;
