<p>
I have not done any research on room rates and availability however I do
<br>
have the following comments.
<br>
<p>1.  Hotels here tend to be full and and that is why rates are high so
<br>
make your reservations ASAP.  Yes there are a few of the real cheap
<br>
chains like Motel 6 and others in the area but it would be very risky to
<br>
hope to fly in and try to get one on the fly.  Could it happen? Maybe;
<br>
but don't bet on it.
<br>
<p>2.  If you drive a car to the conference site expect to pay parking
<br>
fees.
<br>
<p>3. If you are looking for a different hotel try one of the lesser known
<br>
facilities on North First Street.  The Light Rail runs along First
<br>
street and has a stop about 1/2 block from where the conference is being
<br>
held.  If you choose to try another hotel ask how far to the Light Rail
<br>
stop or be prepared to pay cab fare.
<br>
<p>4.  There is a Crowne Plaza close by that might be a little cheaper I am
<br>
not sure.
<br>
<p>5.  San Jose is spread out and several chains have more than one
<br>
facility in or near San Jose so be sure to check the address and a map
<br>
to make sure you will be where you want to be.  
<br>
<p>6.  Check the San Jose Visitors Bureau site <a href="http://www.sanjose.org">http://www.sanjose.org</a> and
<br>
click on the link for accommodations.  There are also several other San
<br>
Jose websites with hotel info, use the web.
<br>
<p>7.  The San Jose Airport is busy.  If you are flying in on Friday
<br>
evening be advised that it sometimes gets very hectic with individuals
<br>
returning from business trips.  Plan accordingly.
<br>
<p>8.  To orient yourself in downtown San Jose learn where the following
<br>
streets and highways are:
<br>
Interstate 280, Guadalupe Parkway, Santa Clara Street, San Carlos
<br>
Street, First Street, Market Street, Almaden Boulevard and the following
<br>
locations: Convention Center, Tech Museum of Inovation, Fairmont Hotel
<br>
and San Jose State University.  San Jose State University is a few
<br>
blocks away so if you wander around very much you should know how to get
<br>
back to the conference site from the campus.  Looking from The San Jose
<br>
Convention Center toward the Tech Museum will help orient you on the
<br>
downtown version of looking &quot;North&quot;.  Standing in front of the San Jose
<br>
Convention Center and looking down San Carlos street towards SJSU gives
<br>
you a rough idea of the downtown version of looking &quot;East&quot;. Thus First
<br>
Street runs north-south and San Carlos runs east-west.  The Fairmont
<br>
Hotel one of the easier buildings to recognize.
<br>
<p>I hope to see many of you at Extro 5.
