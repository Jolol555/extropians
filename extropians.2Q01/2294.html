<em>&gt; &gt; Seems to me like the death penalty is more a case of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legalized communal revenge than anything to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; justice. The idea that a Govt. can  actually kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone is disturbing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't the idea that a government can put you in prison for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, deny you any chance to pursue a career, or marry, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; travel, or even have children equally disturbing to you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You perhaps may want to bring about a situation where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person A can in fact kill person B, but no government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can kill person A regardless of what he has done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, isn't it better to let ten thousand guilty men
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go free rather than deprive an innocent man of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; livelihood, his freedom, and his family?  (Never mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the ten thousand guilty men may do; apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's important is that our own  hands, i.e., our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government's hands, remain clean.)
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>A couple of quick points...
<br>
- No one is talking about letting people go free, as you have mentioned
<br>
above... a life sentence is a bloody awful prospect.
<br>
- There is no reason in my mind to trust the justice system (in your country
<br>
or mine) to decide when a person should be killed.. there seem to be too
<br>
many cockups. Life imprisonment is a fair compromise, because when it turns
<br>
out that a person was innocent after all, they are (usually) not already
<br>
dead.
<br>
- Also, disturbingly, there seem to be a lot of political machinations
<br>
around whether people are executed or not, in the US; thumbs up or thumbs
<br>
down seems to be related to the predicted effect on the governors PR, and
<br>
subsequent likelihood of being reelected. If you are going to do that, then
<br>
make the convicted fight savage beasts in an arena for the pleasure of the
<br>
crowds... be honest about what the real purpose of the sentence is.
