<em>&gt; One thing that will probably keep natural gas as the fuel of choice is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hydrogen will embrittle and ultimately make steel gas lines fail. Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hydrogen burns with a colorless flame (it does emit UV, that's how you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detect a hydrogen fire) so there are safety concerns with piping the pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gas around the country.

<p>Butane seems to have potential as well.

<br>
Cosmo Oil Develops Butane-Fueled System for Homes. Cosmo Oil, in cooperation
<br>
with Toshiba Corp., has developed a butane-fueled onsite fuel cell system for
<br>
power generation in homes. The fuel cell, which has a generation capacity of
<br>
up to one kilowatt, is the first time in Japan that fuel cells using butane
<br>
have been developed.

&quot;The vision is staggering: a society powered almost entirely by hydrogen, the
<br>
most abundant element in the universe . . . The overall goal of DOE's Hydrogen
<br>
Program is to replace two to four quads of conventional energy with hydrogen
<br>
by the year 2010, and replace 10 quads per year by 2030. A quad is the amount
<br>
of energy consumed by 1 million households.&quot; National Renewable Energy
<br>

Breakthroughs in fuel cell development are sparking international interest and
<br>
the race is on to perfect this ultimate power source. Canada has become a
<br>
world leader in fuel cell technology. &quot;We've been working on making the fuel
<br>
cell marketable since 1983 and we finally see light down the road,&quot; says Dr.
<br>
Martin Hammerli, Acting Manager of Hydrogen and Electrochemistry at CANMET's
<br>
Energy Technology Centre (CETC).
