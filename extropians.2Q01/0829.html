<em>&gt; &gt;And there are definitely seems to be at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;two Amara Graps (something I found surprising).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joking? No there's only one me (so far).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S. If you were serious, then I'll bet you a bottle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wine from the Pfalz that you are wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm, it appears I may be in error.  I was assuming that
<br>
a dusty astronomer would not also be an expert in wavelets
<br>
but according to this report:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://content.seyboldreport.com/SRIP/wavelet/">http://content.seyboldreport.com/SRIP/wavelet/</a>
<br>
that may have been a bad assumption...
<br>
<p>Your bonus point score for depth AND breadth just went
<br>
up in my book.  Now if you tell me you also design
<br>
role-playing games, I'll completely fold my hand.
<br>
<p>If all those refs really are you, then you have Greg and I
<br>
beat by quite a bit.
<br>
