<p>Mike, think about this for a minute -- the quotes I keep seeing
<br>
are that the inside volume is going to be ~ that of the cabin
<br>
of a 747.  The maximum head count that I've seen for &quot;occupation&quot; of
<br>
the ISS is 7 people.  Thats 7 people inside the volume of a 747 cabin.
<br>
Don't you think its unlikely they will be tripping over each other?
<br>
Cables can't take up *that* much space.
<br>
<p>Its fascinating if you go over this design.  You have the U.S.
<br>
Destiny lab, then the ESA lab, then the Japanese lab, then a
<br>
couple of Russian labs.  What precisely are all these labs going
<br>
to do?  What can the labs do that hasn't already been done on
<br>
the the Mir or Spacelab?  Have you looked at the prices that NASA
<br>
anticipates charging for the hourly allocation of an astronaut
<br>
as a &quot;lab operator&quot;?  Makes hourly rates for lawyers and doctors
<br>
look positively &quot;minimum wage&quot;.
<br>
<p>The whole thing has a bad smell.  In contrast if you positioned
<br>
it as an orbiting observatory platform or an &quot;assembly&quot; operation
<br>
then you would be getting something from it.
<br>
<p>Answer this -- why can't one attach a couple of dozen Baby Hubble's
<br>
to the space station?  Is there some orbital difference between
<br>
the Hubble and the ISS that makes it unusable as an observatory?
<br>
Is it simply not stable enough?  What gives here?
<br>
