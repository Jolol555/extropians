<em>&gt;In contrast to both you and Tyler, however, I am not very troubled by the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The legal process may produce truth, but I think it safe to say that most
<br>
individual lawyers do not think of themselves as participating primarily to
<br>
produce truth.  They want to win.  Most academics, on the other hand, do think
<br>
of themselves as seeking truth, so it seems worth pointing out to them that
<br>
their behavior suggests that they also mainly want to win.
<br>
<p>I doubt that deliberate exaggeration itself facilitates the search for truth.
<br>
The best institutions we can find using existing humans may in fact frequently
<br>
result in exaggeration.  In which case it would be negative we should accept.
<br>
But it would still be something truth-seekers would regret.  And I have my
<br>
doubts about how well existing legal and academic institutions do at promoting
<br>
truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... Consider, for instance, that we agree about almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything.  That's perhaps an odd thing to say, but only, I think, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we take our nearly universal agreement for granted.  Most conversation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particularly outside of professional and academic contexts, does not involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;debate.  (Review, for instance, recent discussion around your household.)  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;debate only a very few, usually not very important (e.g., sports), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usually not very easily resolved (e.g., theology) issues.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is just not true.  Ordinary people disagree on just about
<br>
everything, e.g., household chores, who likes who, what foods are healthy.
<br>
They disagree especially on just about any question of individual ability.
<br>
People consistently think themselves more able than others think them,
<br>
in cooking, driving, kissing, you name it.
