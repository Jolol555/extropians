I read your initial post and then went over to their website to look around.
<br>
While I share a few of this group's concerns about the militarization of space, I
<br>
too noticed that their rhetoric very quietly went from anti-military/anti-nuke to
<br>
what seems to be a general opposition to space development (or, at least,
<br>
capitalist space development). They're either being subtle or vague, I'm not sure
<br>
which.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, this is all too common with left/liberal oppositions to misuse of
<br>
technology: they quickly evolve (devolve?) into general anti-tech,
<br>
anti-capitalist rhetoric, mainly because the left always attracts more
<br>
back-to-nature types and well-meaning but scientifically ignorant naysayers. As a
<br>
lifelong advocate of space develoment/exploration, this is very frustrating for
<br>
me. Just because I share some of the same concerns and agree with many of their
<br>
positions in regard to social issues (although I rarely agree on the solutions),
<br>
I don't want to automatically be lumped in with everything they stand for (or
<br>
against). I also don't want to be lumped in with just any old gung-ho pro-tech
<br>
camp either. The consequences of our implementation of any technology are
<br>
important to look at and plan for, but neither out-and-out rejection nor blind
<br>
acceptance are realistic or useful approaches.
