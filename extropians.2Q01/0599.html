Subject: Bush Budget Jeopardizes Tech Fund
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal program that pays for research into  
<br>
emerging technologies like cheap digital TV components and new ways 
<br>
to diagnose genetic diseases is in jeopardy under President Bush's 
<br>
budget. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists and companies that received federal funds from the  
<br>
Advanced Technology Program say cutting it would leave a huge gap 
<br>
in the availability of investments in future technology. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Bush gets his way, the Commerce Department program would have  
<br>
its funding -- which skyrocketed during the 1990s -- suspended 
<br>
pending a review. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``The program hasn't been thoroughly evaluated. We believe that  
<br>
it ought to be,'' Commerce spokeswoman Mary Crawford said. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though ATP has a separate oversight office, which has given the  
<br>
program glowing reports as recently as May 2000, Crawford said 
<br>
that's not enough. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``There have been a couple reports that have raised questions  
<br>
about the program,'' she said. ``This is a new administration. 
<br>
Secretary (Donald) Evans is an engineer by background, he is very 
<br>
seriously committed to making sure that the Commerce Department is 
<br>
doing top-quality research.'' 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, she said, cutting the program completely is ``not  
<br>
on the table.'' 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cutting ATP has been on the table in Congress for years,  
<br>
with its Republican opponents calling it a form of ``corporate 
<br>
welfare'' that should be ended. The Clinton administration 
<br>
vigorously defended ATP, citing studies that said many companies 
<br>
would not have pursued such research without federal help. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While ATP was created in 1988 trade legislation enacted under  
<br>
President Bush, it didn't receive funding from Congress until 1990. 
<br>
In 2001, Congress allocated $145.7 million to the program, which 
<br>
typically pays 50 percent of the costs of a selected project. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Kelly, president of the Federation of American Scientists,  
<br>
said that defending ATP has been difficult because the program only 
<br>
funds emerging technologies, and doesn't pay for a specific 
<br>
product. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``Once you've got the basic idea in play, then people can run  
<br>
off and make proprietary products,'' he said. ``There's a huge 
<br>
(funding) gap that's left in places where the public has an 
<br>
interest in moving technology forward. ATP filled that 
<br>
brilliantly.'' 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program funded the development of cheap transmitters for use  
<br>
in digital and high definition television, considered essential in 
<br>
encouraging broadcasters and customers to use HDTV. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``We probably wouldn't have been able to develop these kinds of  
<br>
techniques and capabilities without the ATP program,'' said Terry 
<br>
Smith, a director at New Jersey-based Sarnoff Corp., which took 
<br>
part in the collaboration. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Sarnoff and its partner companies, finding investors was  
<br>
difficult in the current economic climate and companies didn't want 
<br>
to take the economic risk for a technology that might not bring 
<br>
revenue-producing products for many years. ATP provided about $28.4 
<br>
million. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``This is technology that has huge potential for returns,''  
<br>
Smith said, ``but it's also a real stretch among the companies that 
<br>
are doing it.'' 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government gave more than $31.4 million to Affymetrix of  
<br>
Santa Clara, Calif., to develop keychain-sized DNA chips for use in 
<br>
a handheld device that can analyze genetic material. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``The near term benefits that have flowed out of it are improved  
<br>
tools to do basic life science discovery,'' said Rob Lipshutz, the 
<br>
company's vice president for business development. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other ATP-funded research had led to the development of  
<br>
fiberglass rustproof beams for bridges and towers, cloning 
<br>
technology and a cornmeal-based polyester cloth. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly said one reason for the political opposition to ATP is  
<br>
that it first appeared as a heavily funded government program just 
<br>
as a budget-minded Republican Congress took over in 1994. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``It's probably the most investigated start-up fund in the  
<br>
history of the government,'' he said. ``Its timing was such that it 
<br>
was the new kid on the block at the wrong moment in history.''
