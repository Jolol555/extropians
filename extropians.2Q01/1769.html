At Wed, 28 Mar 2001 21:58:38, Hal Finney wrote what
<br>
may be a devastating critique of just about everything
<br>
that I have been saying in this thread about lookup
<br>
tables.  For the time being at least, I have no answer
<br>
to a number of points that he has made.  Anyone who is
<br>
really interested in all this lookup table jazz: I
<br>
refer you to his post, rather than just simply quoting
<br>
the entire thing.
<br>
<p>He does, though, in addition, come at the question from
<br>
the direction of &quot;playback&quot;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But for a playback, the question is harder.  Suppose we play back an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience of drinking orange juice.  We know that there is or was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious entity which had that experience.  What we want to know is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when we replay it, does it have that experience again.  We want to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether it is having the experience right here/now during the playback.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We know the experience itself exists or existed, but we want to localize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it in space and time.  We want to know whether it exists in that region
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of spacetime where we are doing the replay, in addition to its existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the region of the first run-through.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, well, I have also thought a lot about playback.  If
<br>
we accomplish the playback by getting all the atoms back
<br>
into (a suitably near) configuration, and letting it happen
<br>
all over again---or equivalently, we run the same program,
<br>
then there cannot be any question but that the experience
<br>
occurs again too.
<br>
<p>But if playback means simply creating a sequence of
<br>
representations of the states, that's completely different.
<br>
That's analogous to saying that it's immoral to let a
<br>
movie projector run (especially in an auditorium where
<br>
no one is present) showing an atrocity.  The suffering
<br>
that occurred during the real atrocity is not captured
<br>
by the motion picture, which only captures photons
<br>
reflected by various surfaces during the incident, and
<br>
some sounds.
<br>
<p>The whole lookup table scenario was entirely equivalent
<br>
(in my mind) to this, but maybe that was a stretch.
