This is way cool .... 
<br>
<p>We knew before about dust levitation on Saturn's B ring (the spokes),
<br>
and about dust levitation on the Moon, and now we have dust levitation
<br>
on Eros!

<p>Cornell cosmologist Thomas Gold revives old debate about moon to explain
<br>
movement of dust into craters of asteroid Eros

<p>ITHACA, N.Y. -- More than just dust was kicked up when NASA's Near Earth
<br>
Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft, NEAR Shoemaker, made a successful landing
<br>
on asteroid 433 Eros on Feb. 12.  Also disturbed were the memories of an
<br>
experiment carried out more than three decades ago by a student of Thomas
<br>
Gold, professor emeritus of astronomy at Cornell University.
<br>
<p>Images of small craters on 22-mile-long Eros, sent back to Earth by the
<br>
NEAR spacecraft's camera, revealed a fine-grain material that has somehow
<br>
found its way to the bottom of the craters.  The members of the NEAR
<br>
imaging team, including the team's leader, Cornell astronomer Joseph
<br>
Veverka, expressed puzzlement over the movement of the dust that had
<br>
created flat, smooth floors in craters.  There is, they said, some unknown
<br>
mechanism that moves the dust around so that it slides down the craters'
<br>
sides, &quot;ponding&quot; in the bottoms.
<br>
<p>Gold was, perhaps, the only observer not surprised.  Static electricity, he
<br>
argues, causes dust grains to levitate downhill into the bottom of craters
<br>
-- the same process, he believes, that has filled craters on the moon.  &quot;If
<br>
you added a layer 1 micron [0.001 millimeters] thick in the time since the
<br>
Pyramids were built [about 5,000 years ago], you could get a layer 1
<br>
kilometer in depth over a billion years,&quot; says Gold, who has long been
<br>
known as one of the world's foremost cosmologists.
<br>
<p>&quot;The features on Eros are so similar to those on the moon, that dust
<br>
levitation has now to be reconsidered for all large lunar features, and
<br>
major conclusions of lunar research now have to be reconsidered,&quot; says Gold.
<br>
<p>Electric charges on the grains, he says, were created by charged-particle
<br>
bombardment from the sun's solar wind, a current of ionized atoms and
<br>
particles such as electrons and protons that the sun spews from its
<br>
surface.  When electrons with a high enough energy hit the dust grains,
<br>
they either cause the grains to gain more negative charge or more positive
<br>
charge, depending on the substance.   &quot;It's a very intriguing possibility
<br>
and one which we will be evaluating seriously during the coming months,&quot;
<br>
says Veverka, who is chair of Cornell's astronomy department.
<br>
<p>Gold's controversial theory dates back to stormy debates that continued
<br>
through the 1950s into the early 1970s on the geology of the moon's impact
<br>
craters and their flat, dust-filled floors. Gold himself had written his
<br>
first paper on the subject in 1955.  And in the late 1960s his graduate
<br>
student, the late Gregory J. Williams, carried out research at Cornell's
<br>
astronomy department, which Gold chaired from 1959 to 1968, into the
<br>
electrostatic agitation of the surface layers of fine rock powders.  In
<br>
1976, Williams' Ph.D. dissertation, Electrodynamics and the Moon --
<br>
Transport Mechanisms, expounded many of Gold's theories on the
<br>
transportation of dust on the moon.
<br>
<p>The laboratory experiments found that dust particles under lunar conditions
<br>
move when different grains adopt very different charges.  The electrical
<br>
interaction sets up strong electric fields on a very small scale, allowing
<br>
electrical forces to levitate and move the dust particles.
<br>
<p>&quot;Based on the details of reflection of sunlight, grains on the surface had
<br>
to be small enough so they could pile on top of each other in a very loose
<br>
formation, which my colleagues called 'fairy castle structures.' I can't
<br>
understand any process that could occur on the moon that would lift up
<br>
material the size of a brick, but I can understand processes that would
<br>
lift up 50-micron-sized grains,&quot; says Gold.
<br>
<p>This contradicted the view of many geologists, who believed that lunar
<br>
craters typically were filled either by material ejected by meteoroid and
<br>
asteroid impacts or by lava.  However, says Gold, the smoothing and filling
<br>
in of craters on the moon and asteroid Eros was not accomplished by falling
<br>
debris from an impact (which would give a &quot;snowed over&quot; appearance to the
<br>
land and rocks) -- and lava flows on tiny Eros are not possible.
<br>
<p>&quot;The amount of material that is missing from the craters on the side of the
<br>
moon visible from Earth, if distributed all over that area, would make a
<br>
layer between one and two kilometers deep.  You either have to say that
<br>
this material vanished from the moon, which is not likely, or that it had
<br>
migrated downhill just as it would have done on Earth for different
<br>
reasons,&quot; says Gold.
<br>
<p>The filling in of craters from dust levitation on Eros appears to Gold to
<br>
be similar in nature -- and to be taking place at about the same rate -- to
<br>
the erosion present on the hidden side of the moon, which does not receive
<br>
as intense an electron bombardment from the solar wind as does the side
<br>
facing Earth.  Since Eros lies 289 million miles from the sun, it is hit by
<br>
fewer higher energy electrons than the facing side of the moon.
