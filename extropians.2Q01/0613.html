<br>
<p>I've had on my list the task of writing an extended critique
<br>
of this but haven't gotten to it yet.
<br>
<p>I'll simply start with this:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So for now, we can say that ultra high levels of intelligence will expand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outward at the speed of light, but recognize that this may not be the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual limit of the speed of expansion, or even if the limit is the speed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of light that this limit may not restrict reaching other locations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely wrong.  I've done the calculation on this and I've
<br>
been forced to admit that Robert Freitas seems correct in his
<br>
opinion that you send probes.  Why?  Because &quot;ultra high levels of
<br>
intelligence&quot; requires *ultra-large* amounts of information.
<br>
In the solar system alone, you get 10^40+ bits.  There is
<br>
no way you can &quot;transmit&quot; 10^40 bits using even gamma ray lasers
<br>
in the age of the universe.   The further away you go from your
<br>
information source, the greater it costs you to retain access
<br>
to your &quot;memory&quot; (because you lose the photons as they spread
<br>
in space due to the inverse square law).  As you move further
<br>
and further away your energy limits means you become &quot;less&quot;
<br>
ultra-intelligent.
<br>
<p>The only way you send information is by encoding it in matter
<br>
and send the matter.  You can't send matter at the &quot;speed-of-light&quot;
<br>
because its infinitely expensive to send it at that velocity.
<br>
You also can't send matter at a speed even close to the speed
<br>
of light because as Spike has pointed out hitting the
<br>
interstellar hydrogen ablates your data &quot;package&quot; so by the time
<br>
it gets to the destination there isn't any information left.
<br>
<p>The rest of the discussion just gets worse...
<br>
<p>This points out that Kurzweil hasn't been reading our archives
<br>
or doing proper net searches (otherwise he certainly would have
<br>
run accross the discussions about the Matrioshka Brains).  The
<br>
part that doesn't make any sense is that he was at the start
<br>
of my discussion at the Spring '99 Foresight SA meeting where
<br>
I discussed the fundamental limits on intelligence.  So he
<br>
*should* be aware of the concepts and not be going off into
<br>
flights of fantasy regarding worm-hole travel (No MAGIC PHYSICS!).
<br>
<p>As I believe I've pointed out several times in various forums,
<br>
advanced civilizations don't want to expand their size scales
<br>
they want to shrink them.  Moravec's muon-onium or Ander's
<br>
Neutronium are the way to go (if they can be done without
<br>
magic physics).
