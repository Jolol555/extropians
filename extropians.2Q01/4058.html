</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, Margaret Mead is a bad choice for an example. Since much of my
<br>
academic background is in anthropology, I can say with a fair amount of
<br>
certainty that her theories have become increasingly less credible over the
<br>
last ten or fifteen years, and some anthropologists have tossed her out
<br>
completely (except for her place in a historical context). As for your
<br>
multiple choice setup, neither answer would be completely accurate, and I
<br>
don't think too many serious social scientists would call Mead a screwup
<br>
because later generations have replaced her theories with ones that work
<br>
better. This isn't how science works. Whether she turns out to be right or
<br>
not, her significance is based on her contributions to an ongoing body of
<br>
work.
