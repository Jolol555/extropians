<p>I have some personal experience in this area (as do
<br>
many others, no doubt).
<br>
<p>I have been on Zoloft, Welbutrin and Prozac.  None of
<br>
those drugs made me even close to &quot;happy&quot;.  What they
<br>
did do was lessen the impact of depression so that I
<br>
could continue to function despite enormous emotional
<br>
trauma.
<br>
<p>The only drugs that have ever made me &quot;happy&quot; have
<br>
been cocaine, speed and alcohol.  Each produced only a
<br>
temporary happiness... an artificial one.  And alcohol
<br>
is too dose sensitive... If I ingest too much the
<br>
&quot;happy&quot; effect goes away leaving me artificially
<br>
depressed.  Cocaine and speed have other problems.
<br>
<p>Real happiness has come from two sources, interactions
<br>
with people I am emotionally attached to (my children,
<br>
spouses, lovers and friends) and from accomplishments
<br>
such as writing a piece of software that works, fixing
<br>
a delectable meal, or mastering a difficult musical
<br>
passage.
<br>
<p>Increasing serotonin levels in the brain doesn't
<br>
produce the same kinds of feelings as those things I
<br>
mentioned.
