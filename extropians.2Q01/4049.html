<em>&gt;You have signed up for cryonics. And you can't buy eternal life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lacking of money. You must take your bath instead and wait that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somebody revives you as a charity act. Your only solace is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the technics of cryonics is &quot;nearly&quot; perfect.
</em><br>
<p>But Christian!  In the same email that Marie wrote to which
<br>
you are replying, she also submitted this:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lame arguement... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the Whoops I missed Singularity side: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it's an insurance policy that you can change, you don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend the money till your hinny needs a liquid N2 bath 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway... so you only spends it if ya needs it...
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand why that doesn't apply to what you wrote
<br>
(in principle, at least), or why you didn't address it.
<br>
<p>Your scenario about being unable to afford eternal life
<br>
provided by the Singularity---because somehow your cryonics
<br>
expenditures impoverished you---just does not hold up.
<br>
<p>In the first place, you don't seem to understand the scope
<br>
of the transformation that comes with a Singularity.  To
<br>
imagine yourself pitifully ensconsed in your wheelchair at
<br>
age 90, able to somehow make it into your dewer to get frozen,
<br>
yet unable to benefit from the Singularity, is silly.  If you
<br>
live through the minutes preceding the Singularity, whatever
<br>
issues that you find that you still have to worry about, well,
<br>
concerns about money and cryonics won't be among them.
