<p><em>&gt; On one hand, Python and Java are great learning and implementation

<p>I would suggest using Python over Java, especially since there's
<br>
Jython (a Python written in Java). Yes, in case you've been
<br>
wondering, Guido pays me to plug it at every opportunity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; languages, hiding a lot of nasty details from the programmer and generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making clean, tight implementations easy.  The problem is that most new
</em><br>
<p>Fewer lines of code, easily readable, cleanly structured, with a small
<br>
price to pay at execution time. What more does a hacker's heart want?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; programmers seem to stop at that level of abstraction.  After all, what do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you need C for when you can program in Java?  Many CS programs, particularly
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about Java (can it at all easily interface to C?), but many 
<br>
Python projects use C modules (Python has been designed to interlock
<br>
well with C), and almost every nontrivial project uses a mix of embedding and 
<br>
extending Python (CPython (the canonical one) is written in ANSI C),
<br>
and Python comes with tools like SWIG, which automate tasks which
<br>
would be repetitive and tedious to do manually.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the compressed ones, have completely discarded assembly language and many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have either dumped C or made it optional.
</em><br>
<p>You mean, C is not an assembly language? Just kidding ;)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My company has been hiring recent graduates of these programs, all of which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have proven to be bright and productive programmers, but whose &quot;lowest&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level language experience is Java.  While this works perfectly most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, a problem occasionally emerges in that they all program for an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idealized hardware platform -- they are completely unaware of how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software they write *actually* interacts with the hardware they work on.
</em><br>
<p>I've found a source level debugger (I use ddd) with a machine instruction 
<br>
view on the traced program to be quite pedagogical. x86 assembly stinks
<br>
(as opposed to Alpha or StrongARM), so I do not intend to learn it,
<br>
if I can avoid it, but it's nice to know you can, and the debugger
<br>
will assist you in that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most of the time this isn't an issue, but when we start to push hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limits, the old farts need to be called in to take care of architecture and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design issues that aren't obvious to people who aren't very familiar with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hardware.
</em><br>
<p>Not surprising. This must be pretty bad in defense and aerospace, where 
<br>
you need tight, reliable, hard realtime code.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I am not saying that C should be a first language, but I think a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument can be made that it should be your second or maybe third.  I never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use C for general application programming, but there are many things I work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on that could not be done well without it.
</em><br>
<p>When I say Python, I usually always say Python/C. It's a pair which are
<br>
quite complementary. 
<br>
<p>One of the nicer points of Forth on Forth hardware is that you can descend
<br>
to the barest bits and ascend to very high level code in a heartbeat. And
<br>
given that a Forth CPU fits onto a screenful of VHDL, and (if manually translated)
<br>
compiles into 10-20 k transistors, it cloaks the bare silicon level surprisingly
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>One of the things which convinced me that IT is very irrational is
<br>
that Lisp machines and Forth machines are either extinct, or have retreated
<br>
into very deep niches, having become very invisible.&lt;/lament&gt;
