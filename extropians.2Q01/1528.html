<p>Thats not quite true.  PDB is on an exponential growth curve as well --
<br>
its just at a lower starting point.  They are going to 'assembly-line'-ize
<br>
3D protein structural analysis but its going to take another 3-5 years
<br>
to get there (you have to do purchase/build the necessary hardware
<br>
and assemble the teams for this).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you talking about robust AI Minsky or Lenat style? That's pure snake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil they're peddling.
</em><br>
<p>I've seen a presentation by Lenat, and he nicely documented an analytical
<br>
problem solved by their approach that was not solved by humans.  And
<br>
of course I know you are aware of the group at either ORNL or Argonne
<br>
that has proved mathematical conjectures that were previously unproven
<br>
(computers can exceed the depth of thought (most) humans seem capable of.)
<br>
<p>Minsky pointed out at the same conference that Lenat was speaking at that
<br>
the brain may use a dozen or so 'heuristics' to determine the distance
<br>
and size of an object it 'sees'.  We have yet to see a computer that
<br>
incorporates those dozen strategies and effectively learns to select
<br>
between conflicting results.
<br>
<p>I'd strongly doubt you can call what they are doing 'snake OIL'.
<br>
They are laying the foundation in different areas for parrallel or
<br>
even novel ways of doing some of the things that the brain does.
<br>
Divide and conquer.
<br>
<p>But if you want true self-conscious AI --
<br>
<p>[NOTE: And here I will make a prediction -- &quot;When&quot; we understand
<br>
completely what 'consciousness' is; we will say 'Is that all it is?'
<br>
and it will cease to hold the &quot;high&quot; position that it now does
<br>
in terms of discussions like 'rights', 'simulations', 'zombies',
<br>
etc.  We will view 'consciousness' as just something else the brain
<br>
can do -- just as the visual neural system has the ability to
<br>
assemble lines, merge them into complete 'shapes', map them onto
<br>
recognizable objects, etc.]
<br>
<p>-- then IMO you need to look carefully at what William Calvin has
<br>
been saying about the need to simulate yourself as the actor in
<br>
the internal view of the 'scene'.  That combined with a better
<br>
understanding of how one 'talks to oneself' will yield the necessary
<br>
understanding.
