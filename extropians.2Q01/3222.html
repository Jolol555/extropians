<em>&gt; How do extropians envision transition from mankind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to whatever posthuman future awaits us?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are the documented scenarios that have been considered?
</em><br>
<p>I think the &quot;generic&quot; scenario would be something along the lines of: first 
<br>
various cognitive enhancements through external technology (wearable 
<br>
computers, smart agents, Internet) and better and better tuning of our bodies 
<br>
(nootropics, control of hormones etc). Gradually implants (wholly artificial 
<br>
or biotechnological) become available and used, producing significant bodily 
<br>
improvements and breaking down the barriers separating human from something 
<br>
artificial. Later on nanotechnology becomes available, and people shift to it 
<br>
rather than clunky bionics. This is in turn followed by integrating nanotech 
<br>
more and more into the body, until the natural biological part eventually 
<br>
ceases to be relevant: all its functions have been subsumed by the nanotech. 
<br>
<p>Note that this is a gradual scenario of people improving themselves and 
<br>
possibly their children, not a &quot;new species&quot; suddenly appearing.
<br>
<p>Another scenario involves the rather discrete shift to a digital existence 
<br>
through uploading: at some point it becomes possible to scan the brain into a 
<br>
computer and continue existence as software (possibly downloaded into 
<br>
suitable bodies). This is however for technical reasons unlikely before 
<br>
fairly strong nanotechnology. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I mean, afaik, historically, genetic replacement happens by massive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extinction of species in very short times (geologicallywise, anyway),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the surviving ones filling the void (that they might or not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caused, to begin with). Do you expect some posthuman species to just sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around (maybe in secret) and takeover the planet after some inevitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catastrophe wipes mankind?
</em><br>
<p>No. That is a Hollywood meme - dramatic, makes a good drama, but in the end 
<br>
misleading. Of course, some here argues that AI might do something like that 
<br>
(which I also disagree with, but for other reasons).
<br>
<p>Besides, the emergence of new species is quite often cause by genetic drift 
<br>
in entire populations: when it got colder during the ice age many mammal 
<br>
species developed thicker furs as those genes promoted the fitness of their 
<br>
offspring and hence spread widely through the population. The idea that the 
<br>
new species out-competes the old doesn't seem to be very popular among 
<br>
biologists these days (it is far too based on the idea of evolution as having 
<br>
discrete steps and a &quot;plan&quot;). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If not, this might mean a completely different way for species to emerge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than have been seen in the past. Do you expect genetic enhancement to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become so cheap that just about every human will eventually have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modified?
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't seem entirely unlikely. There is a vast market for it, and once 
<br>
the initial expensive attempts have become routine the price will likely go 
<br>
down. Add to this that the standards of living are increasing in most places 
<br>
worldwide, especially the fairly pro-genetic South-east Asia, and I think it 
<br>
will eventually end up on most health plans (or whatever replaces them in the 
<br>
future). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would that result into a sustainable species? How long do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect it for the transition to take? 
</em><br>
<p>A few generations, so I guess 50-75 years. As Eliezer pointed out, this might 
<br>
be too slow for it to matter when more radical technologies appear, but it 
<br>
might be an important mental threshold to pass in order to make other 
<br>
enhancing technologies acceptable.
<br>
<p>I don't see why genetic modifications would not make the species 
<br>
&quot;sustainable&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Won't the biggest brake to such transition be public opinion and   
</em><br>
traditional religion?
<br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, many (most?) genetic enhancements are only useful if done at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conception time, so that the embryo may develop new or substantially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different organs (Dawkins argues that the phenomenon of growing individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at every generation from a monocellular embryo is one of the biggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breakthrough in the last 3 billion years of genetic evolution).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, the biggest potential for genetic progress in posthumans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in making new individuals. However, such method, by definition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot ever make any previously existing individual immortal, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise satisfy anyone's direct selfish interest (or can it?),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that only a tiny fraction of genetic engineering is actually open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for much transhuman progress. Yet, only selfish interest, coupled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the responsibility associated to liberty, ensures that things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go into a consistent direction of progress. How do you envision the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future with respect to this kind of problems?
</em><br>
<p>Gene therapy might become good enough one day (especially with nanotech) to 
<br>
make pre-existing individuals immortal. Although it could be that the first 
<br>
immortals would be rather cyborged while their children are more organic (and 
<br>
their childrens children wholly nanotech?) At family reunions 
<br>
great-granddaddy tells incredoulous digital child entities about the days of 
<br>
Sinclair ZX-81 and Windows, while the nanotech parents gossip in the kitchen.
