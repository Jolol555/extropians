<p>
When I was talking about mentoring, I was not talking about an emotional act,
<br>
but about a rational and purposeful act of preservation and transmittal of
<br>
knowledge. The point is not in spreading memes, but in teaching how to think
<br>
well, and listing what knowledge is available. Knowledge and information are far
<br>
more fluid than DNA, they can, are, and should be re-engineered and improved by
<br>
each new generation. Dogmas are rigid, and need heavy infrastructure to survive,
<br>
as institutionalized religions demonstrate - what a waste.
<br>
<p>Eugene mentions basic unquestionable motivations, not rooted in reason. Exactly:
<br>
people evolve, and the motivations that ensure superior reproductive fitness
<br>
proliferate in the population. Wanting to survive, and wanting to reproduce are
<br>
examples of two perhaps most important desires. Would you now stand by these
<br>
evolved patchy selfish heuristics, and forget about reason?
<br>
<p>The fundamental concepts are life and scarcity. Scarcity implies competition,
<br>
competition implies adaptation. Scarcity is an essence of the universe (as far
<br>
as we know), while the odds of the long-term surival of life is what our
<br>
fundamental rational goal could be. It's far-fetched and notional, but it still
<br>
implies some concepts such as creation of better forms of life, continuous
<br>
improvement, expansion, etc.
<br>
<p>Best regards,
<br>
