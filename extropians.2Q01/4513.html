Hi Spike,
<br>
<p>This thread is pretty stale by now, but I just got around to it. (Reading
<br>
this list is like drinking from a fire hose.)
<br>
<p>I checked the responses from other readers and even did a key-word search on
<br>
the IMDB, but didn't find references to 3 stories with a cryonics theme :
<br>
<p>One was a story that ran through about six episodes of  The Wise Guy: The
<br>
'bad guy' was demented, and the discovery that he had his parents in cryonic
<br>
suspension in the cellar was used as proof of this. Their defrosting,
<br>
treated as a liberation, as part of the resolution of the story. Very
<br>
unpleasant.
<br>
<p>An episode of the X-files gave it a weird twist (naturally). The deanimated
<br>
was dreaming in his dewar and influencing events through psychic powers.
<br>
Leave it to the X-files!
<br>
<p>The third one was remarkably positive, and I'm surprised that no one
<br>
remembered it. On an episode of LA Law a former acquaintance of one of the
<br>
lawyers tells him that she is dying of a brain tumor. She wants to be frozen
<br>
immediately before the tumor destroys her brain, but the cryonics
<br>
organization can't participate in what would be legally regarded as a
<br>
suicide. The team took her case and sued to let her be allowed to have
<br>
herself frozen, not as a suicide, but as a way to save her life. And they
<br>
laid out the premise of cryonics: that it stops the clock for that person so
<br>
that current technical capabilities are irrelevant. The judge gave her
<br>
permission, but told her to do it immediately because he was fairly certain
<br>
he would be overruled on appeal. In the last scene as she's about to be
<br>
frozen, she thanks her friend for saving her life. Steven Bochco produced
<br>
that series. This episode was so positive and helpful, even proselytizing,
<br>
that I wondered if he had taken a personal interest in cryonics. Does anyone
<br>
know?
<br>

<p><em>&gt; I'm not so sure the strangeness of cryonicists is the problem, simply

</em><br>
<p>I can think of only four references to cryonics in film/TV:
<br>
<p>1)  Clarke's 2001
<br>
2)  6 Million Dollar Woman
<br>
3)  Woody Allen's Sleeper
<br>
4)  Austin Powers
<br>
<p>In reference 1, it was only *sorta* cryonics: suspended animation
<br>
for the long trip to Saturn.
<br>
<p>Reference 2, cryonics was used as an advanced medical procedure,
<br>
holding a patient until she could be repaired by robotics.  She lost
<br>
her most recent memories.  Poor Lee Majors.
<br>
<p>Refs 3 and 4 were both in goofy comedies, both times where
<br>
cryonics was used on a healthy person and used as a time travel
<br>
to the future device.
<br>
<p>Any others that come to mind?  spike
