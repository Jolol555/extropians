<p>If you want to run a *nix box on the Net, it is usually a good
<br>
idea to a) avoid major vendors of brokenness such as RedHat and
<br>
Mandrake. This is server, not desktop. You'd want to use Debian, 
<br>
or one of the many *BSDs. b) You'd want to disable all but the 
<br>
barest services you need. (A christmas tree style box lit up with 
<br>
open ports is a standing invitation to any teenage h4x0r). You'd 
<br>
want to run a dedicated machine as a firewall (<a href="http://linuxrouter.org">http://linuxrouter.org</a> , 
<br>
or similiar), putting your server behind it. Don't go for Bastille,
<br>
it's pure cargo cult security. There's also a list of known applications
<br>
you'd want to avoid/substitute by nonbroken alternatives.
<br>
<p>At this point you should really consider whether you'd want to
<br>
hire a security professional to set up the whole shebang. It will be 
<br>
quite expensive, but after the initial setup you can administer the 
<br>
system all by yourself. Provided, you apply the latest patches, you're
<br>
effectively unhackable. Nevertheless, keep your backup history current.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Unless you're ready to get lots of practice rebuilding your system
<br>
each time it's compromised, this is definitely an alternative worth
<br>
contemplation. Do you do your plumbing and the gas connections 
<br>
yourself? I think it depends on what you think your time is worth.
<br>
If you make enough $$$/h, and don't take any pleasure in fixing it/running
<br>
a tight ship all by yourself, here's something to be outsourced to the
<br>
professionals. I don't know anyone off cuff if you need a reference, but
<br>
I know trustworthy people I can ask.
