The following is some personal correspondence incited by my sharing the 
<br>
review I passed on in this thread earlier today.  The first is from a friend 
<br>
of mine who disagrees with me about most everything.  My reply follows:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One again.  This little review looks at the extremes and damns the core 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle.  Sure, we've all know since high school that Thoreau was not the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real, hard core nature guy he pretended to be.  Yes, he returned to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization pretty quickly.  Yes, if you move out to the swamps, there 
</em><br>
will 
<br>
<em>&gt; be snakes and stuff, and even back-to-nature hippies don't want to get too 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cozy with poisonous snakes.  Who doesn't know this?  This is not creative.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tell us something we don't know.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  With religion, especially organized religion, you tend to judge it by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; snake handlers and anti-sex fundamentalists, even though they are likely a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minority of those who participate in organized religion.  With 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmentalists, you tend judge the movement as a whole by those who call 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for moving to the swamps to live with the snakes.  You obviously miss the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point.  The point is that our lovely suburbs and industrial parks are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; squeezing out the snakes in the swamps at a rapid pace.  Deny this, as I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose you will, but it is reality.   So, the point is not to move back to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the swamps with the snakes, but to ask ourselves what our modern society is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing exactly that is destroying the remaining wilderness and is it 
</em><br>
something 
<br>
<em>&gt; we can slow down just a little.  O.K., feel free to make fun of these 
</em><br>
hippie 
<br>
<em>&gt; do-gooders who move to the country only to learn that they don't have the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true grit to live in the backwoods, if it makes you feel smug and superior. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But is doesn't prove &quot;Technology -good; Environmentalism - bad&quot;.   The 
</em><br>
&quot;back 
<br>
<em>&gt; to the country&quot; bit is an ethic, not a detailed  prescription.  It says, &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Think twice before it is too late.&quot;  So don't give us this crap about 
</em><br>
Thoreau 
<br>
<em>&gt; not being a real outdoorsman and, therefore, the environmental/green 
</em><br>
movement 
<br>
<em>&gt; is all bunk.  It doesn't logically follow.   (Yes, Marx was a scholar who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; owed people money and was maybe lazy in some ways and not an oppressed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industrial worker, but this doesn't mean the oppression did not exist much 
</em><br>
as 
<br>
<em>&gt; he described it.)  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I agree with the sentiment that there is &quot;no turning back.&quot;  All six 
</em><br>
billion 
<br>
<em>&gt; (?) of us can't move to the swamp (where would the snakes live?) but we can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to minimize the damage our society does to what is left to the 
</em><br>
wilderness.
<br>
<em>&gt;   I accept the principle that &quot;In wilderness is the preservation of the 
</em><br>
world.
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;   Good farmers leave a field or two fallow some of the time.  He can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly produce more crops by planting these  fields rather than letting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them lie fallow - for a while, dumping fertilizer on them etc., but the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect is  only temporary.  In the long run, the crop yield is reduced.  
</em><br>
I'm 
<br>
<em>&gt; sure your technical people can figure a way around this, or think they can, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it is a practice that has stood the test of time.  It is not 
</em><br>
anti-science 
<br>
<em>&gt; to leave a field fallow.  It is practical, though low-tech, science.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Finally, the &quot;no turning back&quot; argument is one I've been using to argue 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the libertarian fallacy (&quot;ethic&quot;) for several years.   With 6 
</em><br>
billion 
<br>
<em>&gt; people, or whatever the number is now, just as we cannot return to life in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wilderness, we cannot return to a life without a significant amount of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government.  Make fun of the Greens with the &quot;no turning back&quot; you silly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fools, but this is the same problem with libertarianism, but because you 
</em><br>
like 
<br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;antigovernment&quot; ethic, you can live with libertarian fallacy that we 
</em><br>
can 
<br>
<em>&gt; turn back.  You say, oh well, we do need government for some things . . . 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarians aren't unreasonable - they don't believe in NO government just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOT MUCH government, but you are no different from the green hippie who 
</em><br>
come 
<br>
<em>&gt; back from a month or a year living in the swamps to the comfort of a hot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shower and air conditioning.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Environmentalism is an ethic and an aesthetic - it is better to preserve 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wilderness, it is better to minimize the environmental impact of our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enterprises.  It is an aesthetic because green is pretty and makes us feel 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human, warm and happy.  Libertarianism is an ethic and aesthetic - it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better to minimize government when you can, it is better not to fuck with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people and let them do their own thing.   It is an aesthetic because it 
</em><br>
feels 
<br>
<em>&gt; good to do one's own thing without government fucking with you. Of course, 
</em><br>
we 
<br>
<em>&gt; cannot turn back, but this doesn't mean we have to reject the idea that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wilderness is a good thing, worth preserving, even if we don't want to live 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the swamp ourselves.
</em><br>
<p>Before you react so strongly, you might want to know that Kaufman IS a strong 
<br>
conservationist, as am I.  He's just seen what I've seen, which is that the 
<br>
logic of the green ideology is inconsistent not only with the fundamental 
<br>
values of liberal democracy, but also, ultimately, of civilization itself.  
<br>
This sort of thing has happened before.  You can start by smiling and 
<br>
pledging a commitment to &quot;liberty, equality and fraternity&quot;, and end up 
<br>
chopping off people's heads on a grand scale.
<br>
<p>Read this:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://reason.com/rb/rb022801.html">http://reason.com/rb/rb022801.html</a>&quot;&gt;International Forum on 
<br>
Globalization&lt;/A&gt; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://reason.com/rb/rb022801.html">http://reason.com/rb/rb022801.html</a>
<br>
<p>and then, before you say that these are inconsequential extremists, do a 
<br>
little research -- as I have done -- into just who the people are who are 
<br>
featured in this article.  The people who organized and spoke at this 
<br>
conference are cited and relied on as leaders by both the Sierra Club and 
<br>
Greenpeace.  They are heroes on America's college campuses and don't have to 
<br>
try to get their voices heard in government and the media.  A couple of them 
<br>
were cited as fundamental authority by a recent presidential candidate in a 
<br>
book he wrote a few years ago.  And they have a LOT of money to spend to 
<br>
propagate their views: Buying a year-long weekly series of full-page ads in 
<br>
the NY Times isn't cheap and you can bet that Jeremy Rifkin's Turning Point 
<br>
Project didn't spend their last dollar on those ads.
<br>
<p>You say, &quot;This little review looks at the extremes and damns the core 
<br>
principle.&quot;  I respectfully disagree.  What I seek is exactly the core 
<br>
principle.  And, as it turns out, this is also what the people who lead the 
<br>
mainstream environmental movement have been steadily doing for the last 35 
<br>
years.  The truth is that the logic of their ideas -- their core principles 
<br>
-- is driving the political expression of their policies into a collision 
<br>
course with other values they reject, but which I maintain are fundamental to 
<br>
the maintenance of a free society.  Ideology DOES matter to political 
<br>
parties, and the leadership of the environmental movement is increasingly 
<br>
pushing their ideology into conflict with the values of the Enlightenment.
<br>
<p>This does NOT mean that one must seek to pave over the planet in order to be 
<br>
true to ideals of liberty and skeptical inquiry.  But it does mean that one 
<br>
has to be honest about how one places relative value on humanity and the 
<br>
non-human world.
<br>
<p>Finally, there's a practical element in my opposition to the growing and real 
<br>
connection between mainstream environmentalism and the &quot;anti-globalist&quot; and 
<br>
anti-technology ideology of people like Rifkin and followers in Greenpeace.  
<br>
The folks who push these ideas simply cannot succeed as they would wish to in 
<br>
time to do what they would like to do, which is stop the economic progress of 
<br>
the Third World before we lose all of our wilderness areas.  The ONLY 
<br>
practical solution to that problem is to develop technologies that will allow 
<br>
the 3 billion people who live in conditions of starvation to mere abject 
<br>
poverty to have what every human being wants -- security from want and a hope 
<br>
for prosperity -- without completely despoiling the natural beauty of this 
<br>
planet.
