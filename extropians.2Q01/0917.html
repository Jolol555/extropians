<p>
While I'm still at it, maybe you could tell me if there are any
<br>
obvious holes in the following scenario:
<br>
<p>Construct a spacecraft using modules in LEO. It will consist of a
<br>
truss structure, onto which habitat modules, cargo and fuel tanks are
<br>
attached.  See <a href="http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game/Dragons2/eurydike2.jpg">http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game/Dragons2/eurydike2.jpg</a>
<br>
for a sketch. The big panels are phased array antennas rather than
<br>
solar collectors. The engine is a NERVA-style nuclear thermal engine,
<br>
and there is also a conventional chemical engine.
<br>
<p>The spacecraft is sent to 3361 Orpheus. During the flight further
<br>
launches of solar sail slow cargo transports are done from Earth. Work
<br>
on constructing a second craft is begun.
<br>
<p>Upon arrival, the craft divides into two. The nuclear reactor part,
<br>
cargo and habitat modules land on Orpheus, becoming a mining base,
<br>
while the (nearly empty) fuel tanks and an auxillary propulsion system
<br>
remain in orbit as a heavy cargo transport.
<br>
<p>The mining base surveys the asteroid, covers the habitats with
<br>
regolith for radiation protection and sets up water mining and
<br>
electrolysis production of hydrogen and oxygen. The new fuel is stored
<br>
in the cargo craft. Extra supplies and equipment arrive on solar
<br>
sails.
<br>
<p>The unmanned cargo craft leaves for Earth, doing an aerobraking
<br>
maneouver to deliver propellant to LEO where it is used to fuel the
<br>
second colony craft that has been built in the meantime, and the
<br>
excess is sold to make a profit.
<br>
<p>The second craft goes to Orpheus, switching crews and adding further
<br>
supplies while being refuelled, eventually going back to Earth with
<br>
the first crew and more propellant. On Orpheus mining is extended to
<br>
production of other supplies such as metal and biosphere materials.
<br>
<p>Any obvious flaws? 
<br>
<p>The crew will have to spend a long time in microgravity; I have been
<br>
toying with the idea of rotating the ship but I'm not sure it would be
<br>
worth it - having access to the full 3D volume of thw habitat section
<br>
rather than living in 2+1 dimensions might offset the feeling of being
<br>
cramped, and the material requirements will likely be less stringent
<br>
if the ship is non-rotating.
<br>
<p>The business plan is rather long-range and mainly interested in
<br>
building the industrial infrastructure needed for large scale habitat
<br>
production (of which there is a predicted tremendous jump in demand
<br>
within 20 years of the start of the operation, due to external
<br>
factors).
