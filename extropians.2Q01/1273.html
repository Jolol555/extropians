<p>Wow, it sounds like you folks are at the other end of the spectrum
<br>
compared with Seattle.  I've got 3 different suppliers competing
<br>
for my connection $$.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Robert, I don't know where you live, but in my area and I'm pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure in the whole U.S., we (the RBOC's) do not currently use IPv6,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore it is unsupported.
</em><br>
<p>This was what I thought about a year ago, but I thought it might
<br>
have improved since then.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem with routers is of course routing tables and how to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think you could handle this by periodic &quot;pinging&quot; and
<br>
maintaining who you are able to connect to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who's going to build and maintain the network on which this all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; runs?
</em><br>
<p>There are a host of people doing the long distance fiber
<br>
stuff and there are a lot of lines drawn all over the
<br>
streets of Seattle and holes in the ground where they
<br>
are laying fiber, esp. downtown (where as you point out
<br>
you get the business $$).  [Its kind of funny walking
<br>
across the street reading the blue line labeled MCI,
<br>
the red line labeled Sprint, etc.]  I'm primarily thinking
<br>
of a startup that is or would do this.  (As you point out
<br>
there are companies doing some related stuff.  I think
<br>
Ricochet is the name of one.  I was looking for perhaps some
<br>
more detail on how these companies are currently doing.)
<br>
My point would be that if the TelCo's don't get involved
<br>
with this at some point there may not be any more use
<br>
for the TelCo's.  You know its &quot;evolve&quot; or perish if
<br>
the environment changes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Self balancing how, because someone else has built in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the very necessary backups to this?
</em><br>
<p>The backups are built into the protocols and the redundancy
<br>
of the datapaths.  What is missing at this point are &quot;fast&quot;
<br>
ways of detecting outages and routing around them.
