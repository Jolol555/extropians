</em><br>
<p>I'm pretty sure its a valid &quot;value&quot; for an extropic self-aware being.
<br>
If there ends up being a strong conversion on extropic perspectives
<br>
(yea, don't we wish...) then it would become a &quot;universal&quot; value.
<br>
<p>[Short sidebar...
<br>
Of course there is a great parody of extropian principles that people
<br>
like Damien and Eliezer should sit down and collaborate on -- there
<br>
you flip all the principles upside down (e.g. you try to make a
<br>
universe that is as completely wasteful as possible).  Probably
<br>
the primary goal is to dump all the baryonic matter in the universe
<br>
into a giant black hole as rapidly as you can.  Interestingly enough
<br>
this gets tricky because as you pour matter into the universe drain(s),
<br>
it radiates lots of high energy that works against you dumping more
<br>
matter into the blakc hole.  The universe seems setup so that we
<br>
could not develop a philosophy where we promote
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And we shall go gently into that dark night with all possible speed&quot;
<br>
Ruins my day, because I only get to be the Antichrist in a simulation.

<p><p><em>&gt; Once you have turned the corner and created self-aware intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings I don't think you can morally any longer claim they exist only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for your own purposes.  
</em><br>
<p>If they are running on my computronium I can.  We are programmed to think
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;free will&quot; should drive the moral system.  What if
<br>
evolving to the highest complexity is the highest moral principle?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A justification from scarce resources is only valid in a truly scarce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resource situation that there is no other way to deal with.
</em><br>
<p>We live in a resource constrained universe.  The big-bang made only so
<br>
much baryonic matter from which computers can be constructed and there
<br>
is only so much matter lighter than iron that can be used to create
<br>
energy and the speed-of-light limits how fast information can be
<br>
exchanged between distant locations.  There are &quot;Limits-to-Growth&quot;
<br>
in the Universe, just as there are on Earth.
<br>
<p>Now, of course you can devise ways of out of this -- you eliminate
<br>
reproduction (real or virtual) and you eliminate the expansion of intelligence.
<br>
I.e. what you got is all you're going to get -- live with it.
<br>
I don't think that is very extropian though.  If you allow any
<br>
growth or expansion *at all* you hit the limits rather quickly
<br>
(on stellar time scales).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I get the impression from your general tone above does not speak of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated real beings as, as it were, beloved children you would be loathe to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sacrifice if you had to but rather as if they are simply your property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and entertainment to do with as you will.  I think there is quite a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference.  
</em><br>
<p>I'm just dealing with the harsh realities -- parents have to allocate
<br>
resources between children.  They try to do it fairly, they try to do
<br>
it in ways that nobody gets hurt -- but it never turns out that way.
<br>
<p>Some on the thread have placed as the highest moral principle that of
<br>
supporting or maintaining any conscious entity that has ever &quot;lived&quot;.
<br>
I would place as higher moral principles developing the highest degree
<br>
of complexity (trans-consciousness?) or supporting the maximum number
<br>
of highly complex individuals (at some point the Earth has to be
<br>
recycled into computronium) or supporting the greatest amount of
<br>
diversity (creating highly complex ecostructures into which various
<br>
levels of consciousness can develop themselves).  Etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Elimiating them because you think them your property or such is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something else entirely.  Merely electing to take care of yourself and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your direct dependents and friends and so on rather than others you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less well is not a large moral problem in a world where there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient scarcity that one has no choice.  But that is not quite the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same thing it seems to me as described above.
</em><br>
<p>I think it is.  Americans are spending $300+ billion on defense per year
<br>
if I recall.  Spread over ~3 billion people, thats $100 / year / person.
<br>
Quite sufficient to lift those at the lowest income levels completely
<br>
out of subsistence existences.  You could extend the argument to the
<br>
overall American wealth.  Our GNP is ~1/3 the world GNP with 1/20th the
<br>
population.  Couldn't we share a bit more of that?  Collectively as a
<br>
culture we have made the decision not to aggressively address this
<br>
problem.  Fortunately bio/nanotech will be able to solve this problem
<br>
over the next couple of decades.
