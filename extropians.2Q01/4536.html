Lee Corbin quoted:
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It seems that thinkers in the field of probability and statistics are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divided into two armed camps, the Bayeseans and the Non- Bayeseans. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that such a divsion has existed amongst educated people for over sixty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years suggests that neither side can clearly be shown to be wrong. When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prior probabilities are given as data, the Non-Bayesean generally has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objection to the use of the Bayes formula, but when prior probabilities are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lacking he deplores the Bayesean's tendency to make them up out of thin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air. The Bayesean retorts that the Frequentist methods merely conceal the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem instead of solving it, and that he really is the more honest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Totally, unarguably CAUGHT over here.  But I disagree with the summary of
<br>
the problem, which is trying to be fair to both sides.  The persistence of
<br>
an argument does not, from a Bayesian perspective, demonstrate that both
<br>
sides are equally right; it can also demonstrate that both sides are
<br>
equally wrong or that the wrong side is exceptionally stubborn.
<br>
<p>The impersistence of an argument is strong evidence that one side is
<br>
right.  The persistence of an argument is necessarily (from a Bayesian
<br>
perspective) a blow, but not necessarily a *severe* blow; it can in fact
<br>
be a very weak blow.
<br>
<p>I would tend to see a Frequentist as a special case of a Bayesian making
<br>
very odd assumptions about the priors.  By contrast, I can think of no
<br>
natural way to view a Bayesian as a Frequentist making odd assumptions,
<br>
which seems to me to place Frequentism at a severe disadvantage if a
<br>
general theory is desired.  It is not a question of &quot;making up prior
<br>
probabilities out of thin air&quot;, but rather the *necessity* of specifying
<br>
*some* set of priors in order for a well-defined problem to exist at all. 
<br>
If the Frequentists don't like our priors they are perfectly willing to
<br>
make up their own; the key point is that the priors should be explicitly
<br>
stated and exposed to public challenge, and to do otherwise is indeed
<br>
&quot;concealing the problem instead of solving it&quot;.
<br>
<p>Hence my statement that I am &quot;totally, unarguably CAUGHT&quot;.
<br>
<p>Wow, there's like this whole cult of non-Bayesians that I never knew
<br>
existed.  I thought they were hunted down and exterminated years ago, like
<br>
the Sith.
<br>
<p>So, Lee, I suppose you would argue that the so-called &quot;if statement&quot; in
<br>
programming should really be named the &quot;if-and-only-if statement&quot;?
