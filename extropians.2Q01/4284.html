<p><em>&gt;Wow, so much for analysis and prognostication. Basically, the article

<p>Some elements are just silly journalism-meets-Flash Gordon comic strips
<br>
(with sly `Orwellian' asides), but other parts are moderately startling:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Nobody has yet circumnavigated the moon in a rocket space ship, but the

idea is not laughed down.
<br>
<p>Doubly wrong, alas; although it was done within less than 30 years, to do
<br>
it again *is* now laughed down.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Men and women of 70 in A.D. 2000 look as if they were 40.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wrinkles, sagging cheeks, leathery skins are curiosities or signs of
</em><br>
neglect. The span of life has been
<br>
<em>&gt;lengthened to 85.
</em><br>
<p>Close enough on both counts, if you live in a comfortable Tottenville.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Automatic electronic inventions that seem to have something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence integrate industrial production so that all the machines in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factory work as units in what is actually a single, colossal organism. In

the Orwell Helicopter
<br>
<em>&gt;Corporation's plant only a few trouble shooters are visible, and these
</em><br>
respond to lights that flare up on a
<br>
<em>&gt;board whenever a vacuum tube burns out or there is a short circuit. By
</em><br>
holes punched in a roll of paper,
<br>
<em>&gt;every operation necessary to produce a helicopter is indicated. The
</em><br>
punched roll is fed into a machine
<br>
<em>&gt;that virtually gives orders to all the other machines in the plant. The
</em><br>
holes in the paper indicate exactly
<br>
<em>&gt;how long a reamer is to smooth the inside of a cylinder, just when a
</em><br>
stamping machine is to pass a sheet
<br>
<em>&gt;of aluminum along to its neighbor with orders to punch 22 holes in
</em><br>
indicated places. There are
<br>
<em>&gt;mechanical wrenches that obediently turn nuts on bolts and stop all by
</em><br>
themselves when the bolts are in
<br>
<em>&gt;place, shears that know exactly where to cut a sheet of metal for a
</em><br>
perfect fit. Every operation in the plant
<br>
<em>&gt;is electronically and automatically controlled.
</em><br>
<p>This is wonderful! Rather than gibe at the writer's failure to foresee
<br>
transistors, let's consider this a sort of drastically wrong-scale and
<br>
slightly too early view of Drexlerian nano-assembly matter complication.
