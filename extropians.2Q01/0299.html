Warning in advance... this is purely a plug for Wizards of AU.
<br>
<p><pre>
----
<p>I'm writing to let list members know that I am currently looking for
Australian IT professionals interested in pure teleworking, in my role as
managing director of Wizards of AU.
<p>I'm looking for experienced, qualified people, who can self-manage
successfully, who can provide their own office facilities, and who are
interested in working in a pure teleworking mode - check our site for some
more information about pure teleworking.
<p>We are currently beginning to talk with a number of companies about the
possibilities of hiring Australians. To help demonstrate the possibilities,
we find it very useful to show them the kinds of people who want to work in
this fashion.
<p>Someone asked me recently if &quot;this teleworking stuff&quot; is like network
marketing or telemarketing or some such thing. No no no! It's exactly like
normal IT work, except that you do it from afar.
<p>Contact me if...
- you are keen to telework
- you are demonstrably a skilled professional in your areas of expertise
- you are Australian (actually, I'm interested in talking to US based
contractors too)
- you don't need a job tomorrow (we are still in early stages)
<p>Thanks.
<p>Mr Emlyn O'Regan - Managing Director
Wizards of AU
