<p>In this context the meaning of randomness might be that there

is not a finite algorithm capable of computing the collapse of a

wave-function.
<br>
But rules that hold for observers who are part of a given simulation
<br>
might not hold outside of it, from a logical point of view......

<p>Computing all evolutions of all simulations is simpler than computing
<br>
just one particular simulation. That's because an algorithm running
<br>
all those simulations is much shorter. (See also the MWI of Q.Mech).
<br>
An algorithm computing just one simulation requires a lot of
<br>
informations, initial conditions, etc. It's interesting to point out
<br>
that if there are many simulations (universes) and each of these
<br>
simulations is run by a different algorithm, some selection might
<br>
occur. The best simulation (universe) might win. Which is, imo,
<br>
the simulation (universe) run by the shortest algorithm.
