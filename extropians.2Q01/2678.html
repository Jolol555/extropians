</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. The world consists of interacting 'quantum monads'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are like the substances of classical metaphysics
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; twice as many degrees of freedom as a single particle.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, suppose I entangle two particles - they become a monad. Then I
<br>
entangle more and more particles with each other, and they also join the
<br>
monad (this could for example be the Schrödinger's cat experiment). What
<br>
happens when they lose entanglement - does the monad split? Doesn't seem
<br>
to be allowed by your above statements. Presumably all of the universe
<br>
was entangled during the early Big Bang, but it is today not a single
<br>
monad?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. The individual self is a single quantum monad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a very complex state. A momentary state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness is a momentary state of the monad that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is you. 
</em><br>
<p>If my monad is entangled with a spin of an atom, it would have a
<br>
different state than if it is not entangled. Would you claim it is
<br>
impossible to entangle my monad without me becoming conscious of it, or
<br>
is it possible to entangle me &quot;behind my back&quot;? In the second case,
<br>
there seem to be state information in the monad which does not affect
<br>
consciousness, and hence the issue becomes what distinguishes the
<br>
consciousness information in a monad from non-conscious information. The
<br>
first case seems rather unlikely to me, since one could construct
<br>
devices which acts as a Schrödinger's cat box on my physical brain (and
<br>
hence on the entangled consciousness monad) while not giving me any
<br>
sensory information (because (say) it is sitting on my exposed cortex
<br>
and I don't have a mirror). 
<br>
<p>Also, why one monad? Why can't I have ten consciousness monads in
<br>
parallel?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;One very hard thing for me to buy in the Quantum Mind speculation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that somehow the quantum coherence involved is not impacted by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;strong magnetic fields used to image living chemistry in an MRI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;equipment.  Small frogs have been magnetically levitated by very high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fields (<a href="http://www.sci.kun.nl/hfml/froglev.html">http://www.sci.kun.nl/hfml/froglev.html</a>) without loss of neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;activity.  Humans have remained conscious through exposure to lethal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;levels of ionizing radiation that interacts directly to introduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;disorder on the quantum level.  However, micrograms of LSD can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;restructure your consciousness through straightforward chemical paths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a good point. But have psychologists studied people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undergoing MRI? And it's not just a matter of MRI destroying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum coherence; MRI can *induce* transient quantum coherence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if these quantum brain states are there, the first question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is whether they're affected by MRI, the second question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether they're affected enough for the changes to be behaviorally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instrumentally, or phenomenologically detectable.
</em><br>
<p>To my knowledge - I am collaborating with MRI people - no psychological
<br>
effects are observed beside the ones expected from being confined in a
<br>
small space in a loud machine and subjected to medical or psychological
<br>
tests. 
<br>
<p>The states MRI sets up are rather simple, so I doubt they would
<br>
correspond to your complex states, but they seem rather likely to
<br>
disrupt complex quantum states they couple to. Whether they couple
<br>
depends on how your coherenence is implemented in the brain, but if it
<br>
involves electrical fields somewhere - rather likely given the nature of
<br>
the brain - then there ought to be a coupling. 
<br>
<p>In the end it seems like this model is vulnerable to produce zombies.
<br>
The MRI would disrupt the consciousness coherence, which would
<br>
presumably quickly reform only to be disrupted again in the next MRI
<br>
cycle. So personal continuity is an illusion, and memories of the
<br>
experience are laid down without you being conscious through it all.
<br>
This seems to imply that there could be decoherent zombies around.
