Strange? Fucking brilliant, and remarkably gutsy. I bet he's having shitloads
<br>
of fun, too. I hope I ever run into him, so I can shake his hand a buy him
<br>
a beer. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Kick ass&quot;? And how.

<br>
<p>On the run from L. Ron Hubbard
<br>
<p>Keith Henson, Scientology gadfly turned fugitive from justice,
<br>
explains his reasons for fleeing the United States.

<br>
By Damien Cave
<br>
<p>May 23, 2001 | Keith Henson is waging a one-man crusade against
<br>
Scientology. Arguing that the church threatens to undermine the First
<br>
Amendment by suing opponents into submission, he has fought the house
<br>
that L. Ron Hubbard built at every turn. Since 1995, when the church
<br>
first angered Net users by trying to close down a newsgroup dedicated
<br>
to discussing Scientology's practices, he has posted documents that
<br>
the church considers secret on the Web, picketed the church's
<br>
headquarters and defended his actions in court.
<br>
<p>Just last month, the California Superior Court in Riverside County
<br>
handed Henson a major defeat. Citing Henson's picketing in front of
<br>
Riverside's Golden Era Productions (a sound and film studio for the
<br>
Church of Scientology) last summer and messages he posted in a
<br>
Scientology newsgroup, the court found Henson guilty of violating the
<br>
state's hate-crimes law. His demonstrations, the court ruled,
<br>
interfered with Scientologists' constitutional right to religious
<br>
freedom.
<br>
<p>Online critics of Scientology, and some free-speech advocates,
<br>
responded to the decision with outrage, calling Henson &quot;an American
<br>
hero.&quot; His conviction, they said, was nothing less than a &quot;miscarriage
<br>
of justice,&quot; as one poster at geek site Slashdot put it. Others called
<br>
Henson &quot;a martyr.&quot;
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, Henson's tactics have often seemed a bit quixotic -- even
<br>
his supporters say that he tends to act without thinking.  They
<br>
question, for example, the wisdom of Henson's two-line contribution to
<br>
a thread in the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup about directing a
<br>
nuclear missile at church members. Henson contends that his post
<br>
implied no real threat to Scientology members and that it was merely a
<br>
response to another post in a long-running joke about &quot;Cruise&quot; (as in
<br>
Scientology celeb Tom) missiles.
<br>
<p>Still, it was an odd move for someone ostensibly dedicated to serious
<br>
critique, and it brought an immediate outcry from
<br>
Scientologists. &quot;Free speech does not protect threats of mass
<br>
destruction,&quot; said Scientology spokesman Ken Hoden. &quot;It does not
<br>
protect threats of missile attacks. It does not protect what he
<br>
did. He's trying to hide behind the First Amendment.&quot;
<br>
<p>David Touretzky, a Carnegie Mellon computer scientist and fellow
<br>
Scientology gadfly, says that Henson tends to incriminate himself in
<br>
his encounters with Scientologists -- often providing church officials
<br>
with legal ammunition they later use against him.
<br>
<p>Henson's legal strategy has been criticized as well. Cindy Cohn, legal
<br>
director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Henson
<br>
refused to let the civil liberties nonprofit represent him, choosing
<br>
instead to have a court-appointed attorney. Henson contests Cohn's
<br>
claim -- &quot;I've never been offered help from the EFF,&quot; he says -- but
<br>
just last week, he once again confounded his fans by failing to show
<br>
up at his sentencing hearing, where he could have been sent to jail
<br>
for a year.
<br>
<p>So where is Keith Henson and what is he up to? In a telephone
<br>
interview from Canada -- where he's applying for political asylum --
<br>
Henson explained why he played hooky from the hearing and what he
<br>
hopes to achieve by moving his case forward from abroad.
<br>
<p>You're now a fugitive from justice -- why?
<br>
<p>I actually came up here for a different reason. I came up here to
<br>
picket for another cause. But while I was here, a bunch of people were
<br>
trolling on the Net, talking about my coming up here as a political
<br>
refugee. And there was so much trolling and so much interest that we
<br>
said, &quot;Why not?&quot; So I stayed over an extra day and we checked with
<br>
Guidy Mamann, who is apparently a top immigration lawyer in Canada. We
<br>
chatted for a while, and I filled out the paperwork. He fired up a Web
<br>
browser, found some stories and said this was a viable case. So I blew
<br>
off [the California court] and I've already paid [Mamann] a retainer
<br>
to deal with this from up here.
<br>
<p>Why not stay and fight from the States?
<br>
<p>Well, I would have gotten a certain amount of PR and done a certain
<br>
amount of damage to [the church] had I gone back and gone to jail
<br>
there. But there's a justification for being here. In spite of the
<br>
fact that there's more risk and that it generates even more criminal
<br>
problems for me, nonetheless, being here has the potential to generate
<br>
more heat on Scientology.
<br>
<p>Have you been in touch with the American courts?
<br>
<p>Oh yeah, I talked to the probation guy down there this morning
<br>
[Thursday]. I just updated him on where I was and what was going
<br>
on. He didn't have much to say.
<br>
<p>You seem to enjoy being a martyr for the cause.
<br>
<p>Other people hold me up as a martyr. I'm not a martyr; I just kick
<br>
ass.
<br>
<p>But it must feel good to be in the spotlight. How much of what you're
<br>
doing has to do with the a desire for attention?
<br>
<p>It's a minor factor. The social strokes are reward for doing good
<br>
stuff -- I wouldn't deny that. People work hard to get the Nobel
<br>
Prize. I'm not going to get the Nobel Prize. I'm not going to get any
<br>
kind of prize. But I'm a known person because I've been involved with
<br>
this stuff for a long time.
<br>
<p>How much have you spent on your case?
<br>
<p>I've spent about $35,000.
<br>
<p>How long do you plan to stay in Canada?
<br>
<p>Forever. If the U.S. government decides that what I did was not within
<br>
the framework of free speech, if the [U.S.] State Department supports
<br>
the government of Riverside County in what I'm arguing is an abuse of
<br>
human rights, then I ain't going back.
<br>
<p>So what happens next?
<br>
<p>Well, there's going to be a review of the situation. Because when you
<br>
apply for refugee status on the basis of human rights, your lawyer is
<br>
your advocate and the Canadian government is your opposition.
<br>
<p>An immigration review board adjudicates this thing. And in order to do
<br>
this, by treaty and custom, the Canadian [authorities] go to the State
<br>
Department. They have to go in and investigate, and come up with the
<br>
transcripts and motions and all of that.  They need it in order to
<br>
defend themselves, to prove that what went on was a fair and unbiased
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>So the State Department sometimes does this [itself], and at other
<br>
times [it has] the Justice Department do it. But I suspect that when
<br>
they start doing this thing -- and they realize that there were severe
<br>
violations of protocol -- what may well happen is that they may march
<br>
through Riverside County, Calif., and deal with [the church].
<br>
<p>What's the goal of your efforts?
<br>
<p>The ultimate goal is to reform or completely destroy Scientology.
<br>
It's completely undemocratic.
<br>
<p>Do you feel like you're getting anywhere with this, in the big
<br>
picture?
<br>
<p>Oh yes, yes indeed. This is the endgame. I don't know whether we're
<br>
years away or months away or even weeks away. But the problems that
<br>
Scientology has at this time are legion. Let's put it this way: a
<br>
[Scientology] event that for years had been attended at a fairly high
<br>
level had 40 percent of the people show up that they expected.
<br>
<p>Where'd you get that number?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From people who were there. We have spies with Scientology --
</em><br>
disaffected Scientologists -- all over the country.
<br>
<p>It all sounds so cloak-and-dagger.
<br>
<p>Oh, it's definitely that. For example, we think there's a pretty fair
<br>
chance that Scientology will try to do a snatch-and-grab situation up
<br>
here, where they come after me.
<br>
<p>Are you saying that you're afraid you'll be kidnapped?
<br>
<p>Sure.
<br>
<p>So are you just staying at that same house -- the one where you're
<br>
talking from?
<br>
<p>No. I'll be living at a number of safe houses here. I'm also taking
<br>
perhaps as [much] as a billion dollars of electronics work out of
<br>
California.
<br>
<p>Are you talking about a business that's already established in
<br>
California?
<br>
<p>No, it's a huge development project, a huge development and production
<br>
project. But I'm not going to go into detail about it.  You'll find
<br>
out. If it works, you'll find out about it shortly.
<br>
<p>Since when are you the kind of person who protects secrets?
<br>
<p>OK, I'll give you this. Let's just call it a billion-dollar-scale,
<br>
cryptic stealth surveillance technology. That'll keep them guessing.
