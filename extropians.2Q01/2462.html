From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Benefits%20of%20future%20neuroscience%20applied%20technologies&In-Reply-To=&lt;144701c0c6af$442f4960$235c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; The big question is, can you live in the same society as relativists, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you have to fight them?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, come on Anders, you can come up with a bigger question than that. ô¿ô
<br>
I'm a lover, not a fighter, so I get along (relatively) fine with societal
<br>
relativists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I take the classical liberal stance that even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when plenty of ethical systems and views are erroneous, it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally wrong to repress them - even if you believe in an objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality you better admit to yourself that you might be mistaken about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things, and if you force your views on others you might be perpetuating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ethical outrage.
</em><br>
<p>That we might be mistaken about things is part of our genetically driven
<br>
biological morality. That others may be equally or more mistaken makes this
<br>
easier. Permutation City isn't built in a day though, so rather than waste
<br>
time and resources repressing luddite memes, it seems more useful to promote
<br>
and encourage greater health, prosperity, freedom, practicality, and
<br>
excellence, than to dwell on coercive memes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The same of course goes for everybody else, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hence a policy of tolerance is the best option. This doesn't mean you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to stop questioning things, testing whether ethical systems hold up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or asking uncomfortable questions to people. Political correctness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not really tolerant of this.
</em><br>
<p>Right. That's what my (tolerant) comments intend to convey (without getting
<br>
into the ethics quagmire).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for diversity, at least Stockholm is rapidly approaching the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity I have seen in my visits to the states. In fact, Stockholm is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost becoming a different country from Sweden - which might actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a return to its old status as a foreign city :-)
</em><br>
<p>Let me know when (or if) it's possible for English speaking only expatriates
<br>
to succeed in Stockholm. I like blondes. (See news item below.)
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)

<p>REYKJAVIK (Reuters) - Taller people with light brown hair earn higher salaries
<br>
than shorter co-workers with other hair colors and blondes receive the
<br>
smallest pay checks of all, an Icelandic study shows.
<br>
<p>The Reykjavik Commercial Workers Union surveyed its members in October and the
<br>
findings, based on 3,400 answers, were released on Friday.
<br>
<p>Blonde employees earned 10 percent less than their light brown haired
<br>
colleagues, whose monthly pay averaged 232,000 Icelandic crowns ($2,700).
<br>
<p>People with very dark hair came second, followed by red- and grey-haired
<br>
individuals. All these were ahead of blondes, whose salaries averaged 208,000
<br>
crowns.
<br>
<p>Women earned on average 18 percent less than men.
<br>
<p>Men above the height of 179 cm were paid on average 260,000 crowns a month,
<br>
16.5 percent more than men 10-15 cm shorter.
<br>
<p>Women taller than 179 cm took home 213,000 crowns compared with 195,000 crowns
<br>
for females below 165 cm.
<br>
<p>The study also suggested that salaries were not influenced by whether
<br>
employees smiled on the job or not.
<br>
<p>``Stop dyeing your hair (blonde) and be satisfied with the mousy color, as it
<br>
seems to be working. Buy shoes with higher heels, and above all, start
<br>
frowning on the job,'' Icelandic investment bank Kaupthing said in a comment
<br>
on the study.
