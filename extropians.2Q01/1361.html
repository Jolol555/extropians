<p><em>&gt; But how can you have conscious knowledge (conscious knowledge is, by

</em><br>
<p>An eliminitivist would not use this definition of knowledge,
<br>
obviously; on account of this, your interpretation of Dennett is
<br>
uncharitable in the extreme.
<br>
<p>Eliminitivists can and do give good accounts of what thinking and
<br>
awareness are.  For example, one simple account of thinking might be:
<br>
modelling the object of awareness in the structures of the brain and
<br>
acting on the basis of those models.
<br>
<p>This account of awareness isn't the kind of awareness any
<br>
self-respecting mental realist should want, however.  On this account,
<br>
extremely simple computers are aware of some things, even if they
<br>
don't have any internal feelings, or any feeling of awareness, since
<br>
they have a model of the world and act on the basis of that.
<br>
<p>Nonetheless, THAT'S what Dennett means when he says &quot;it merely seems
<br>
like we're conscious.&quot;
<br>
<p>It &quot;seems&quot; that we have consciousness, but this definition of
<br>
&quot;thinking&quot; doesn't require any consciousness at all, not in the
<br>
internal what's-it-like sense of consciousness.  It merely says that
<br>
our brain models represent a &quot;feeling&quot; above and beyond the operations
<br>
of the brain (even though no actual feeling accompanies that internal
<br>
representation).  In that sense, it &quot;seems&quot; to us that there is
<br>
consciousness, by virtue of the fact that we tend to &quot;think&quot; that we're
<br>
conscious.
<br>
<p>Why switch definitions like this?  Because Dennett himself is reading
<br>
the term &quot;seems&quot; charitably.  Your definition of &quot;seeming&quot; never
<br>
refers to anything under his theory of mind.  Yet there is something
<br>
right about saying &quot;I seem to have two hands.&quot;  Dennett has identified
<br>
what that &quot;something&quot; is under this theory, and used &quot;seeming&quot; to
<br>
refer to that.
<br>
<p>You might argue that the plain-old-english definition of &quot;seeming&quot; is
<br>
the one we ought to use, but that definition is obviously theory-
<br>
laden: it doesn't make sense unless you believe that there is internal
<br>
what's-it-like-ness.  So the definition of &quot;seems&quot; is exactly what's
<br>
under debate here: a &quot;seeming&quot; is either an internal quale or a model
<br>
of reality, depending on what theory you take to be true.
<br>
<p>If you like, you could differentiate the terms: seems[1] involves
<br>
qualia and seems[2] is nothing more than a brain model.  Dennett would
<br>
be contradicting himself to say &quot;It just seems[1] that there are
<br>
qualia,&quot; but luckily for him he's merely saying that &quot;It just seems[2]
<br>
that there are qualia.&quot;
