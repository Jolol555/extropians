<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         March 19, 2001
<br>
<p>Stardust Team Develops Technique to Keep Camera Clear
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December, Stardust, the mission to Comet Wild 2 to 
<br>
capture dust particles and return them to Earth, cleared a 
<br>
coating that was clouding its camera optics by applying heat. 
<br>
Today, team members are investigating the reappearance of the 
<br>
coating, which is similar to the frost on a car windshield, and 
<br>
they plan to use the same heating technique again to clean up the 
<br>
optics.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camera is designed to guide Stardust to its encounter 
<br>
with Comet Wild 2 in 2004 and is still capable of meeting its 
<br>
objectives. As Stardust passed by Earth last January, it snapped 
<br>
pictures of the Moon with excellent resolution and similar 
<br>
pictures will be acquired of the comet during the Wild 2 flyby. 
<br>
Engineers deduced that the clouding of the lens might be due to a 
<br>
substance that evaporates and settles, clinging to the coldest 
<br>
parts of the camera. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We believe that the heating option will give us back our 
<br>
improved sensitivity performance and reduced scattered light, 
<br>
thereby providing excellent images at Comet Wild 2,&quot; said 
<br>
Stardust project manager Tom Duxbury of NASA's Jet Propulsion 
<br>
Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  A longer period of heating may 
<br>
clean the optics permanently. If not, heat will be applied again 
<br>
as the spacecraft gets closer to the comet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission will bring back more than 1,000 dust particles 
<br>
from the coma, the cloud of dust and gas that surrounds a comet.  
<br>
Stardust's Cometary and Interstellar Dust Analyzer (CIDA), 
<br>
provided by the Max-Planck-Institut fur extraterrestrische Physik 
<br>
of Garching, Germany, will capture comet dust, study its 
<br>
composition, and transmit the data back as the spacecraft flies 
<br>
through space. A dust flux monitor, provided by the University of 
<br>
Chicago, will measure the comet particle count and size during 
<br>
the encounter.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the latest imaging sessions, the filter wheel, which 
<br>
allows imaging in different colors of light, was found to be 
<br>
stuck in one position, the optical navigation position, which 
<br>
uses a clear filter.  This could be due to any of several 
<br>
possible situations, such as a faulty power supply, a shorted 
<br>
coil or a locked wheel. The imaging at the comet will only be 
<br>
minimally affected since the camera will continue to take black 
<br>
and white pictures of an object that probably has very little 
<br>
color. The primary objectives of the camera, which guide the 
<br>
spacecraft to the comet and take images of the comet nucleus, 
<br>
will still be carried out in full.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stardust, a part of NASA's Discovery Program of low-cost, 
<br>
highly focused science missions, was built by Lockheed Martin 
<br>
Astronautics and Operations, Denver, Colo. is managed by the Jet 
<br>
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., for NASA's Office of 
<br>
Space Science, Washington, D.C.  JPL is a division of the 
<br>
California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif. The 
<br>
Principal Investigator is astronomy professor Donald E. Brownlee 
<br>
of the University of Washington in Seattle. More information on 
<br>
