Sorry for my delayed response, but I've been out of town on a snowboarding 
<br>
foray (shudder of delight); sorry for the curt reply, but now I've got a lot 
<br>
of work to catch up on (plain old shudder).
<br>
<p>In a message dated 3/17/01 1:10:53 AM, Robert (<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20Is%20Extropian-ism%20doomed?%20was%20Re:%20Reliberion&In-Reply-To=&lt;a0.11a4ede8.27e90733@aol.com&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>) wrote in 
<br>
relevant part:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If we assume that extropian principles are those striving for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increasing complexity and sophistication (this may be vulnerable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to attack, but lets assume it for a minute) -- and *if* we assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that conscious entities are inherently valuable and you cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infringe on their right to self-determine whether or not they should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue to exist do we not have an inherent conflict?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure it's helpful to grant the first assumption even arguendo, as it 
<br>
does not specify whether extropians seek to increase complexity, etc. at a 
<br>
*personal* level or a *universal* one.  I'd argue for the former 
<br>
interpretation on a number of grounds.  That takes care of much and maybe all 
<br>
of the supposed conflict with the second assumption, though I would want to 
<br>
hear more specificity about the rights of sims to processing cycles.  Do they 
<br>
have a welfare right to computational resources?  I should think that the 
<br>
same arguments against welfare rights generally apply in this instance, 
<br>
though perhaps sims bear some sort of ward/guardian relationship with their 
<br>
sysops.  But in that event, the sims lack full moral agency and thus cannot 
<br>
claim fully liberty rights.  So the supposed conflict between extropian 
<br>
principles and sims' rights becomes simply a hard choice in circumstances of 
<br>
limited resources--unwelcome and perhaps even tragic, but not fatally 
<br>
contradictory.
