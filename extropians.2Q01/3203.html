Your &quot;humor&quot; seems to be primarily aimed at bashing or otherwise putting
<br>
down other people and ideas. It's getting old real fast. In fact, it is
<br>
so old already that it should be dead and buried, and it would be if this
<br>
list had any moderation. Just to let you know where you stand...
<br>
<p>Hey, for kicks, I went through your recent posts to this list which
<br>
can been found here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/author.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/author.html</a>

<p>Out of over 100! posts since March 1st 2001, I could not find a single
<br>
original thread (forwarding silly pieces of news doesn't count) that
<br>
you originated. Vast majority of your &quot;posts&quot; go like this: you quote
<br>
someone's whole message with a sarcastic, useless comment at the top
<br>
&quot;Probably burned at the steak.&quot; from the &quot;Mad Cow&quot; thread.
<br>
<p>Is it too much to ask that out of 100 posts in less than 2 months that
<br>
there be some substance? Otherwise, what is the point? Do not have any
<br>
friends in RL, and we are stuck as your bar buddies?
<br>
<p>What's sad is that my own post history for the last two months is not
<br>
exactly perfect either. Perhaps I have come to unconsciously regard the
<br>
list as a quick dumping ground for news blurbs and chitchat.
