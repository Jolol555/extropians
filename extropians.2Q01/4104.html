<p>At this point I should probably state that I agree with this assessment of
<br>
Mead's work, as did all of the professors I had when I was studying anthro. The
<br>
only coursework that featured her (or Boas for that matter) dealt with the
<br>
history of the discipline. It's possible I received a skewed perspective,
<br>
though. I was in school in the mid-80s at a small college, and it may just be
<br>
that the group of professors I had weren't pro- or anti-Mead, but just not
<br>
interested in her at all. They had their own particular biases to think about!

<p>I wish I could, but I can't! I'm not trying to be evasive, but this statement
<br>
was more anecdotal than factual. It's been over ten years since I studied
<br>
anthro, and I haven't stayed in the field (I actually work as a network
<br>
specialist). Like I mentioned above, my perspective could simply reflect the
<br>
fact that I studied under professors who weren't particularly interested in
<br>
Mead one way or the other, although I've spoken with a couple of friends who
<br>
actually are anthropologists and they don't seem to have much to say about her
<br>
either (and both went to school in different parts of the US than me). Our
<br>
department was pretty evenly divided among hardcore physical
<br>
anthropologists/archaeologists and cultural anthropologists. The first group
<br>
was very scientific and uninterested in theory, while the second group were
<br>
pretty much all theory (but no Mead!).
<br>
<p>I wasn't really interested in defending Mead or anthropology in general, but
<br>
was just trying to provide a more neutral persepctive. I'm certainly not
<br>
interested in becoming involved in a &quot;war.&quot; Yawn.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;No one in the field has ever held her up as some sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;icon or queen bee (or even as anthropology's Einstein)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That was not my impression, and little else can explain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vehemence in many quarters against Derek Freeman.
</em><br>
<p>My own ignorance of what has been happening in anthro since I lost interest in
<br>
it is reflected in the statement you quote above, although that was always my
<br>
impression. I'm beginning to think I should have stayed out of this one!
<br>
<p>As for the vehemence directed against Freeman, this is just pitiful. If social
<br>
scientists want to practice their discipline as science (and many do), then
<br>
they need to be willing to drop their ideological adherence to theories (and
<br>
theorists) in the face of factual evidence to the contrary. Of course, some
<br>
&quot;hard&quot; scientists have this problem as well. Maybe it's human nature!
