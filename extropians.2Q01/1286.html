<p><em>&gt;&gt; Robert, I don't know where you live, but in my area and I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;pretty sure in the whole U.S., we (the RBOC's) do not currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;use IPv6, therefore it is unsupported.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;This was what I thought about a year ago, but I thought it might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have improved since then.
</em><br>
<p>Disclaimer: My opinions are my own, I do not speak for
<br>
SBC/Ameritech or it's partners.
<br>
<p><p>They really haven't decided on the standards yet, plus in a big
<br>
organization like ours, we have many thousands of routers and
<br>
networks that would have to be updated.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; The problem with routers is of course routing tables and how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; update them (what happens when a route is lost?).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I think you could handle this by periodic &quot;pinging&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maintaining who you are able to connect to.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed thats how it is done, but even on small networks these
<br>
updates soon take up a significant portion of the bandwidth, and
<br>
timing is always a problem.
<br>
<p>And of course voice requires networks with QOS (quality of service) 
<br>
which the current Internet does not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Who's going to build and maintain the network on which this all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; runs?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;There are a host of people doing the long distance fiber
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stuff and there are a lot of lines drawn all over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;streets of Seattle and holes in the ground where they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are laying fiber, esp. downtown (where as you point out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you get the business $$).  [Its kind of funny walking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;across the street reading the blue line labeled MCI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the red line labeled Sprint, etc.]  I'm primarily thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a startup that is or would do this.  (As you point out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are companies doing some related stuff.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ricochet is the name of one.  I was looking for perhaps some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more detail on how these companies are currently doing.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My point would be that if the TelCo's don't get involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with this at some point there may not be any more use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the TelCo's.  You know its &quot;evolve&quot; or perish if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the environment changes.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, we know, but in our case we have dozens of different entities
<br>
and regulators on our backs. Laying fiber is EASY, it's everything
<br>
else after that that's hard. and of course all these companies are
<br>
just doing this in downtown areas, no one is laying it out to
<br>
residential areas, except very wealthy areas.
<br>
<p>A GOOGLE search should yield some names.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Self balancing how, because someone else has built in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the very necessary backups to this?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The backups are built into the protocols and the redundancy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the datapaths.  What is missing at this point are &quot;fast&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ways of detecting outages and routing around them.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't phrase this well, and you have a very good grasp of some
<br>
of the problems. SONET was specifically designed to handle the
<br>
outage/reroute problem and is the best example of this tech.
<br>
<p>It's all in the hands of the regulators I'm afraid. If things stand
<br>
as they are I see three possible results.
<br>
<p>1) As the issue stands the RBOC's have little, no, or even negative
<br>
incentive to deploy a fiber network. This could result in
<br>
drastically smaller RBOC's offering telephone only. Data will be
<br>
left to a hoard of others none of whom will build a network, except
<br>
in business areas.
<br>
<p>2) If the RBOC's can offer data separate from telephone and without
<br>
the telecom act restrictions, they might build a separate data
<br>
network.
<br>
<p>3) Some bizarre compromise of the above two.
<br>
<p>It just pain's me to know we have something so much better planned,
<br>
and yet I sit here with my feet cast in regulatory concrete.
