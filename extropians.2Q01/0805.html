<p>Heres where Im going with this.  Using modern technology,
<br>
if you had to design a craft with all the same constraints they
<br>
had back in 1965, *you would end up with something that
<br>
looks a lot like the space shuttle*.  Beats me how the heck
<br>
else you would return big payloads other than a big glider
<br>
with rocket engines.
<br>
<p>If you had to return just the really expensive bits {motors
<br>
and meat}then you might do better, but consider this:  since
<br>
a good engineer designs around standard parts, the shuttle
<br>
designers used the main engines already developed for the
<br>
Saturn V first stage.  The SatV had 5, the shuttle has 3, but
<br>
they were already developed, so they used em.
<br>
<p>By the same reasoning, if we were to develop a new
<br>
heavy lift reusable, we would likely do the math and recognize
<br>
that we have an external tank, already developed and being
<br>
mass produced, economies of scale, so we can buy these things
<br>
cheeeeapy cheap {as space hardware goes} 33 million bucks
<br>
each.  Furthermore, when you actually do the math, the
<br>
strap on solids make sense too, for all the same reasons:
<br>
they are off-the-shelf parts now.  Good chance it would
<br>
be cheaper to go ahead and throw away an external
<br>
tank than pay the price to have a totally reusable vehicle.
<br>
<p>These observations lead me to these conclusions: that
<br>
a new heavy lift vehicle in the near future {next 20-30 yrs}
<br>
will look a lot like the shuttle, with external tank and
<br>
solids, and consequently the cost to orbit will not get
<br>
dramatically cheaper in that time frame, which means
<br>
the most promising route for space engineering is to
<br>
make the payloads dramatically more capable, as in
<br>
nanotech.  spike
