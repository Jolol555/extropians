<em>&gt;&gt;But the &quot;they&quot; that will pay are almost entirely those innocent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;keeping the spy plane/crew.  Isn't a basic tenet of morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;around here that you don't punish the innocent?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American citizens are blamed/punished/killed all the time for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actions of the U.S government. 
</em><br>
<p>Indeed.  That's wrong too.  I assume you don't consider such
<br>
terrorist groups a moral paradigm, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But the Chinese government is having a grand old time broadcasting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;propaganda to it's people about us, propaganda I was suprised to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see the people so readily believing. 
</em><br>
<p>Gosh, the US gov would *never* do anything like that.  No, they would
<br>
*never*, say, grossly exagerate murders committed by Iraqis or Serbs.
<br>
They would *never* understate dubious activity by those saintly
<br>
freedom fighters in Afghanistan.
<br>
And if they did, goodness, we all know the US public is quite immune
<br>
to nonsense like creationism and the drug hysteria.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sorry, but if you or your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government talk bad about me, I don't trade with you.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's a real problem - the US gov certainly says bad things
<br>
about good people too.  You're not going to trade with US citizens
<br>
either?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You may wish to note that I am personally boycotting China (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;encouraging others) I am not calling for government action on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;boycott.
</em><br>
<p>Right; I was under no impression you wished to force, say, me to
<br>
join your boycott.
