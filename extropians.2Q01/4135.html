Eliezer S. Yudkowsky patiently responded,
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't know that A/V inputs surpass keyboard inputs.  I've never used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one.  I do know that the &quot;feel&quot; of typing and speech is different -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coding, in particular, might require keyboarding, unless the language was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specially designed to be codeable via speech recognition.
</em><br>
<p>Right, and speech recognition for input devices helps to move  keyboards
<br>
toward obsolescence for some people, while for people who can't speak (well
<br>
enough), Raymond Kurzweil has designed systems with input devices to bypass
<br>
that difficulty, as we know. Perhaps it's all a matter of individual need and
<br>
personal preference. The dvorak keyboards I've seen (and handled) left me
<br>
cold. I like the split keys arrangement, and the half keyboard looks mighty
<br>
interesting, though I haven't tried one. Anyone else?

<p>Matias Half Keyboard
<br>
<p><a href="http://computers.cnet.com/hardware/0-1016-8-5754760-7.html?tag=st.co.1016-8-57">http://computers.cnet.com/hardware/0-1016-8-5754760-7.html?tag=st.co.1016-8-57</a>

<br>
Much research has gone into designing effective one-handed keyboards, but most
<br>
require adaptations; for example, the user may have to learn chord typing.
<br>
However, the $99 Matias Half Keyboard makes use of the touch-typing skills you
<br>
may already have, delivering all the functionality of a full-sized board in
<br>
half the space.
<br>
<p>The left hand knows what the right's doing
<br>
The Half Keyboard is half of a traditional QWERTY keyboard, on which your left
<br>
hand also fulfills the functions of your right. Why buy half a keyboard? PDA
<br>
devotees, CAD users, gamers, or anyone who regularly uses a stylus, a graphic
<br>
tablet, or a joystick might appreciate the efficiency of using just one hand
<br>
for keying, while your free hand uses your input device of choice.
<br>
<p>With the Half Keyboard, the left-hand keys become the missing right-hand keys
<br>
by using the spacebar as a toggle key. For example, typing to means reaching
<br>
for T key as usual, then holding down the spacebar and hitting W, which
<br>
becomes an o as long as the spacebar is depressed. Matias offers a
<br>
downloadable (45K) demo of the system at its Web site.
<br>
<p>The Half Keyboard has other special keys and combinations. A unique corner key
<br>
switches the keyboard between number pad, navigation (cursor and Page
<br>
Up/Down), or function-key mode, while special characters (such as @) are typed
<br>
by hitting Shift twice. Standard left-hand letters are printed in big white
<br>
type on the keys, right-hand letters in smaller white type, numbers in yellow,
<br>
and navigation keys in blue. It sounds crowded, but the colors help you keep
<br>
it straight.
<br>
<p>The learning curve
<br>
Whether the Half Keyboard works for you depends on your existing typing skills
<br>
(or lack thereof) and maybe your general level of dexterity. Matias believes
<br>
that touch typists can achieve 18 words per minute (wpm) within five minutes
<br>
(and have clocked speeds up to 64wpm). Normally, we touch-type at 100wpm;
<br>
we're not sure we ever reached 18wpm during our time testing the keyboard, but
<br>
we'd estimate, at the rate we were going, that it'd take us a work day to get
<br>
up to that speed. It might have been easier if Matias included a nub on the F
<br>
key, like the tiny bumps on the F and J of most keyboards, which tell you by
<br>
touch that your fingers are on home row. Those who aren't touch typists might
<br>
actually have an easier time adjusting to the Half Keyboard because they're
<br>
not married to a specific layout. In any case, Matias's 30-day money-back
<br>
guarantee on the device means you can find out whether it works for you before
<br>
committing to it permanently.
<br>
<p>The Half Keyboard also comes with a one-year warranty. The unit is available
<br>
for PC and Mac users, as well as for various PDAs. Tech support is available
<br>
toll-free, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET, and also via e-mail at the company Web site,
<br>
which offers a short list of FAQs, downloadable drivers, and manuals.
<br>
<p>Your better half
<br>
While the Half Keyboard's unique design makes it potentially more efficient
<br>
for users who switch frequently between keying and using an input device,
<br>
learning to use its multifunction keys could be a challenge for some typists.
<br>
If the efficiency of the device intrigues you, just remember there may be a
<br>
learning curve at the beginning.
