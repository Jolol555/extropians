</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not that you can't write interesting stuff in Cobol.  Just that it
<br>
doesn't help you much in doing so.  It was sick becuase the way they
<br>
picked us was to look for math whiz kids.  You don't teach math people
<br>
Cobol.  &quot;Add 1 to X&quot;?
<br>
Barf city.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As a &quot;technical assistant&quot; (cheap programmer) for an oil company in the
<br>
early 80s I created multi-dimensional spreadsheets for evaluating 
<br>
reservoir simulation runs (as well as various sets of field data) from
<br>
their supercomputer. (this was 1983. too bad I didn't know what I had in
<br>
these spreadsheets on steroids).  The supercomputer results came out in
<br>
a long serial mess on tape from which huge printouts were produced.  It
<br>
was sad seeing the Reservior Engineering folks attempting to manipulated
<br>
this data using calculators because writing Fortran programs was too
<br>
tedious and error prone against such a data format (as well as too
<br>
slow).  So I developed this spreadsheet on steroids that allowed them to
<br>
query all the field well data by x,y,z and  time coordinates.  I
<br>
invented a fairly natural language for expressing formulas and variables
<br>
against the data that would recompute if any dependent variables or
<br>
formulas changed, used an inverted file structure to transform the data
<br>
from tape to disk and wrote a fairly sophisticated LALR parser for the
<br>
language by hand.  This was all in Fortran 4, on a 128K fixed memory
<br>
machine with 60 bit words. 
<br>
<p>So yeah, very interesting things can be done even with relatively
<br>
primitive hardware.  But it isn't very intuitive or time-efficient. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The high tech of yesteryear become the junk of tomorrow. For some time, I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 27 SUN-3's stacked in my living room. Today I mostly have SPARCs, DECs, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obsolescent PCs.  The Singularity cometh...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;grin&gt;  I know the dance.  Four tech goddesses in my house.  Twenty
<br>
computers in use.  That many again in various stages of disrepair or
<br>
just not being plugged in at the moment.  Some old SGI hardware that was
<br>
considered tremendously powerful in its day. A hacked up Next Box, a few
<br>
Apple machines, a couple of Sparcs, at least one AIX, a top-end laptop
<br>
from 1994 (now nearly useless) and even an antique PS/2.  
<br>
<p>A lot has happened in hardware in the last couple of decades. 
<br>
Unfortunately, not nearly as much has changed in software.
