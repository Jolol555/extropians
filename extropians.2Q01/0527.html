<em>&gt;From: Alex Future Bokov &lt;<a href="mailto:alexboko@umich.edu?Subject=Re:%20A%20polite%20Napster%20rant...&In-Reply-To=&lt;F302tSgcOrBLSAQV6uP00009788@hotmail.com&gt;">alexboko@umich.edu</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;1. Give one scheme of keeping current intellectual property laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enforceable without implementing legal and technical measures that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(and therefore eventually will) be abused as censorship and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anti-privacy measures.
</em><br>
<p>No law has ever been completely enforceable (if by &quot;enforceable&quot; you mean 
<br>
unbreakable).  Laws are broken everyday, its only the unlucky few who get 
<br>
caught who are prosecuted, and only a fraction of those who are caught get 
<br>
convicted.  This is true for bank robbery, murder, rape, and crimes against 
<br>
humanity.  It will remain true for copyright infringement as well.  Your 
<br>
implied argument is that if you can't stop people from breaking the law you 
<br>
should change the law.  I trust you see the flaws in that argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2. &lt;snipperoo&gt;... My question is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this: is an industry that would otherwise collapse entitled to use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government as a crutch indefinitely?
</em><br>
<p>Seeing as how that pretty much describes *every* industry, I'd have to say 
<br>
the answer to your question is &quot;yes.&quot;  Every business depends on the 
<br>
government and its police power to prevent scofflaws from absonding with its 
<br>
assets (whether they be real, personal or intellectual property).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;3. Supposing the public is willing to accept an abridgement of privacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and free speech, given the increasing availability and sophistication
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of cryptographic software, will such an abridgement even be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technically possible?
</em><br>
<p>See answer to #1 above.  No, you can't prevent criminals from breaking the 
<br>
law.  All you can hope to do is prosecute a sufficient number of them that 
<br>
the majority of the population deems it a good idea not to break the law.
<br>
<p>FWIW, I'm in the &quot;information wants to be free&quot; camp.  But I don't think its 
<br>
arguments like the above that are going to carry the day.
