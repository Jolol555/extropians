<EM>&gt;&gt;  I notice the motorcycle world going back to push rods, which shocks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  me, but I assumed the reason was to imitate Harley Davidson.  Have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  you seen the Japanese Harley clones?  Yamaha is building one that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  so Harley-like you need to be right next to it to tell the difference:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  pushrod, fat bob tank, softtail-like back-end, air cooled 98 CI Vtwin,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  even a belt final drive.  They must stopped.  I want one.  {8^D  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Uh oh.  We've now identified an unbridgeable gap between us, Spike old man.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Back in my biker days, I decided there were three kinds of bikes and three
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kinds of bikers: &quot;Profilers&quot; (Harley-style, low-cut seats, long
</EM><BR>
rake-angles),
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Cafes&quot; (tucked-in, racer-style) and &quot;In-betweens&quot; (classic &quot;straight&quot;
</EM><BR>
sport
<BR>
<EM>&gt;bikes and touring bikes).  Although for practical reasons my wheels were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;always of the latter category (since during most of that time a bike was my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only wheels), my heart was in the middle category.  Had I not gotten out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bikes, I'd be driving a &quot;katana&quot;-style bike today. I always considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Profilers to be ill-considered pieces of &quot;street jewelry&quot;, designed to look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good from the side but having evil handling manners, mainly due to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rider's constricted position and the overly-long wheelbase.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>i dunno about all that....yet....but I'm looking into it.
<BR>
<P>It appears that there are more than three types today.  There are the Hawgs
<BR>
(radically customized Harley's and their clones), the Dressers (Sport
<BR>
bikes?) ....thousand pound plus sportscars with two wheels...or three
<BR>
....the &quot;Cafe Racers&quot; (Katana?).....or &quot;crotch rockets&quot; and perhaps another
<BR>
class....the &quot;cruiser&quot;.
<BR>
<P><P>I think the cruiser category is what Spike might be talking about.....I
<BR>
think it's what I'm looking for too.  I looked at a mad cow yesterday.
<BR>
Kawasaki Vulcan it was....they come is several displacements from 500 to
<BR>
over 1100 cubic whatevers......
<BR>
<P>One variant is the &quot;Drifter&quot; which is seriously retro.  Skirted fenders,
<BR>
wide comfy seat....long wheelbase (sixy plus inches)......
<BR>
<P>Then there is the Honda Shadow, the Cow (?) Valkarye.....and others....it
<BR>
seems bikes is making a comeback.....in fact I read a mag about it and they
<BR>
talk about &quot;re-entry&quot; riders......people (like me) who years ago used to
<BR>
ride...but got out of it....and now are returning to their origins.....
<BR>
<P>Dunno....I'm sure there is some serious policitcal/social/relegiouis/ethical
<BR>
commentary to be derived from all this...
<BR>
<P>EvMick &lt;------looking for a sickle....
