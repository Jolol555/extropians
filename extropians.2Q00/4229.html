<P>
Just a quick mail on a complicated subject.
<BR>
<P>I think there is a danger in that Westerners often romaniticize the Japanese 
<BR>
Zen school of Buddhism, or insert some of their pet theories in it. We must 
<BR>
remember that Zen was and is a rather small school in Japan. It has been 
<BR>
very influential thorugh its aestetics on the samurai class of Japan, but 
<BR>
has never been popular.
<BR>
<P>Quite often Zen presents itself in sightly different manners, focusing on 
<BR>
different subjects, to Westerners than it does to  Japanese. It often 
<BR>
appears as an &quot;atheist&quot; school since the other Japanese schools seem very 
<BR>
theist in comparision (through the veneration of Amida Butsu, Kannon Butsu 
<BR>
or Hachiman Daibosatsu among others). The quite meditation of the Zen 
<BR>
Buddist bônze (buddist priest, in the West often reffered to as monk) seems 
<BR>
quite different from the Nenbutsu mantra chanting often the School of  the 
<BR>
True Pure Land or the bizarre fire walking rituals of the Yamabushi school.
<BR>
The contacts between Zen and Shinto are often not referred to in the West.
<BR>
<P>As always with Zen, I ask for reflection and a sceptical mind, and a deeper 
<BR>
understanding of the Japanese culture and Zen's position in that context. 
<BR>
Then one may better evaluate it is role and ideas.
<BR>
<P>At least not to fall into the same traps as Schopenhauer;-)
<BR>
<P>Namu Amida Butsu
