<EM>&gt; &gt;In this age of modern technology, we should use some of it to enable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cyber-grassroots mobilization.  What has come to mind is a web interface
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to a wwide variety of proposed legislation, a clearinghouse for it, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it were.  Say that as a U.S. citizen you can write suggested legislation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;on any of a variety of topics that are legislatable.  Then, legislation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is organized so that different topics and causes will have compromises
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;hammered, or separate proposals if they are incompatible.  Then, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;legislation is developed in this virtual town hall federally and for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;each region, separately or as one, then as legislation passes through a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;public peer-review process and reaches the point where credible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;volunteers vouch for its Consitutionality and value depending on other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;merits, then the legislation is fast-tracked into the requisite forms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for each jurisdiction, ie, from electronic community, communication,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;discussion, review, and mobilization, then the real world requirements
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for placement in the processes of legislation are fulfilled, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;virtual communities' mobilization is used locally and extra-locally to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;satisfy any requirements, where some of the first legislation might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to enable electronic satisfaction of the requirements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ahh, sweet Utopia, once again you raise your pretty little head.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the tech underlying your suggestion is definitely doable.  After
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all, its not all that much different from what sites like vote.com are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing.  Problem is it would take a supreme amount of &quot;social engineering&quot; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bring about.  Primarily because the lawyers and politicians are calling the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shots, and they are not likely to legislate themselves out of business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anytime soon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, politicians are politicians, with some of them lawyers, yet discounting
<BR>
them, I do not see it that all lawyers would be against more of an Athenian
<BR>
democracy, in fact, many lawyers might be for this kind of thing, it doesn't put
<BR>
them out of business.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But such democratizing alternatives to the creation of law should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pursued.  One thing I'll be watching with great interest, for instance, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to see how the &quot;Engines of Creation 2000&quot; Project comes out.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If they can get a book written by an entire community, I don't see it as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much of a stretch to get some legislation written the same way.  But if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really want to see something as revolutionary as your proposal put to use in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real life anytime soon, you'd better take the advice of Dick The Butcher,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and kill all the lawyers first.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see that as necessary, as many lawyers are skilled and many lawyers are
<BR>
honest.  Besides, the economy would produce more lawyers as many lawyers are
<BR>
useful.  While that sentiment exists since Shakespearean times, it is not
<BR>
realistic.  (&quot;Sue everything!&quot;)

<P>The technology and technological aspect of the re-Atheniazation of democracy is
<BR>
interesting and these factors are those that our culture finds more available
<BR>
and present every day.
<BR>
<P>The issue is resolving the disconnect between what is the will of the people and
<BR>
what happens in the halls of congress.  It's great if a bunch of polls say this
<BR>
or that, yet if the governing rules and laws of our culture are either a) not
<BR>
reflective of the public will, or b) broken by those in government, then there
<BR>
is a problem in gaining some ideal goal of true democracy.
<BR>
<P>The government must always be reminded that it exists by the grace of the
<BR>
people.  When the government is flawed, then if it can not correct itself then
<BR>
it must be corrected.
<BR>
<P>The website you note takes polls of its readers (viewers, browsers?), where the
<BR>
questions are of the type that appear to be for a jury to decide, and the
<BR>
results supposedly forwarded somewhere.  What I have stated would be good would
<BR>
be a website as a frontend to community authored by the general public, thus
<BR>
that the participants are largely the authors, community posts such as that site
<BR>
has are one example of this kind of interaction, but I envision moreso some
<BR>
formalized and egalitarian rules so that the contributors define legislation.
<BR>
The issue is not only how to make it so that authors as citizens representing
<BR>
the citizenry can define popular legislation that the status quo political
<BR>
machine will not, but how to enact this kind of legislation, and even to bring
<BR>
to bear the judiciary to enforce it.  The key contrast here is not to decide
<BR>
specificities of cases but rather to extend as much of the citizenry as could be
<BR>
reached that their true voice be heard.
<BR>
<P>Many different groups have their ideas about what should be law, and there is
<BR>
certainly the primary method of addressing the elected political legislators and
<BR>
expressing your arguments, or paying them which appears to quite effective.  The
<BR>
issue is that there are some laws that majority of the public does or does not
<BR>
want which do not or do exist on the books, for those fractional freedoms stolen
<BR>
and injustices served that the politburo has inflicted on the citizens, these
<BR>
should be retrieved and returned.
