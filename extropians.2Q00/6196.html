<EM>&gt; &gt; And check out www.greenstar.org

<P><EM>&gt; I'd especially be interested in comments from our engineers - is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this as good as we can do RIGHT NOW to get electricity, medicine and the net
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which means education and working around the tin-pot dictators and local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thugs who run most of the poorer part of the world) into villages in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Third World?  It sure looks like it to me.  If this isn't extropian, I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know what is!
</EM><BR>
<P>As an engineer (of sorts): this looks like it would probably be
<BR>
feasable.  It would best be done in areas where the powers that be are
<BR>
not actively oppressing the civilians (for instance, in most of the
<BR>
pockets of ex-USSR and North America they mentioned); as has been
<BR>
mentioned, any regime who is more interested in its own welfare than in
<BR>
the welfare of its citizens might just destroy Greenstar installations
<BR>
in order to to keep control, or (more likely) appropriate them for their
<BR>
expanded benefit at the expense of the people they were meant to serve.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Here's a suggestion: If the Greenstar system checks out to be as good as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looks, maybe we could make it sort of an &quot;official extropian charity&quot;.  I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be very, very interested in such an initiative.
</EM><BR>
<P>It needs doing, true.  But this will, at best, only indirectly support
<BR>
other goals that need tech that does not yet exist (for instance, life
<BR>
extension).  If you're looking for a place to encourage non-extropians
<BR>
to invest, this is certainly a good one, but your own dollars may be
<BR>
better directed to more radical ventures that non-extropians would not
<BR>
support.
