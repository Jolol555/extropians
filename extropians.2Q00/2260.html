<P>
One problem here is that it is hard to determine who to target as perpetrator of
<BR>
these kinds of erosions of freedom.
<BR>
<P>For example, in this red-light camera situation, it is obvious that Lockheed
<BR>
Martin, privately making money off some kind of law enforcement, is somewhat to
<BR>
blame for advancing this violation not only of privacy but of the Consitution
<BR>
which states quite bluntly that citizens are innocent by default.
<BR>
<P>Yet it is too simple to assign blame to them when Anthony Williams has succumbed
<BR>
to the the idea there were ever any red-light runners in the district.  There
<BR>
simply weren't that many, ever.  Sure, it used to have the highest murder rate
<BR>
in the country (because of drug prohibition), but people are generally pretty
<BR>
good about red lights.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps Williams thought that this setup would be as good for the city as its
<BR>
parking meters, which is one of the largest sources of income for the district,
<BR>
which means there are very many meter-readers.  Perhaps moreso L-M payola.
<BR>
<P>Overridingly, this is some kind of pilot program to gauge how far the public can
<BR>
be shafted by those who would shaft.  I say to make it quite obvious that those
<BR>
would-be shafters should go about shafting themselves and leave the rest of us
<BR>
alone.
<BR>
<P>Anyways, I say this before, it seems quite obvious, any automated
<BR>
law-enforcement like a red-light runner camera is a violation of every citizen
<BR>
who passes through that intersection's right to presupposed innocence under the
<BR>
Constitution.
<BR>
<P>Also, the fact that this is privatized and thus provides a financial incentive
<BR>
to the contractor for each ticket issued is an extremely bad precedent as the
<BR>
profit could be seen as a reason to further overstep the contractor's bounds.
<BR>
So, it is absolutely certain that the contractor or other private provider
<BR>
should be required not to be paid more for each infraction reigstered, that is
<BR>
to say, the profit incentive to violate any driver's Consitutional rights should
<BR>
be removed.  That is completely simple, the city must arrange to pay one fee for
<BR>
operation and all transactions, until such time as it is proven unconstitutional
<BR>
and the whole thing scrapped.
<BR>
<P>Well, along these lines, drug prohibition is bad for our country on the whole,
<BR>
and should be abolished.  Relegalization and clemency for non-violent drug users
<BR>
would be a step in the right direction.
<BR>
<P>Who's violating your rights today?  It's hard to tell exactly who, and also it's
<BR>
not so obvious to each of us that each of the rest of us has also had their
<BR>
rights violated.  So, along those lines, everyone who feels that Constitutional
<BR>
rights are good things should be against this privatized program and find ways
<BR>
to unite generally for freedom.
<BR>
<P>Mr. Brown, you state that you think that it is not easy to require the
<BR>
government to not monitor its citizens.  Well, its bad enough now and that is
<BR>
why we need proactive measures and law to protect the citizenry's explicit right
<BR>
to presupposed innocence.  It's in some ways as simple as suing the government
<BR>
to prevent them from doing so.
<BR>
<P>It's pretty bad that we have one elected official and his appointed thug &quot;doing
<BR>
a hold-up of the law.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Just because a law is on the books, it doesn't mean that is a) right, b) moral,
<BR>
c) ethical, and/or d) Constitutional (ethical, mostly right).  Many are.  Let's
<BR>
take a good look at the books.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Does anyone know if there is any legislation being talked about to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prevent these cameras from being used for other than their claimed purpose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of catching red light runners?  Whether or no, as has been previously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pointed out, people are being made, little by little, used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; being watched.  I personally don't care if the power behind the camera is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government or corporate, I'm against it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; When I became part of the 'cryonics crowd,' I made a deal with myself that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I wouldn't become frightened enough of death to live a longer life less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; worth living.  That means I'm still willing to sacrifice my life for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; others if I see the need, and that I'm very cautious about sacrificing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; freedom for the sake of security.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately, I don't see any way to avoid public surveillance in the long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run. We can stage a holding action to slow down government efforts for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while, and I definitely think this is worth doing. However, eventually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (10-15 years) wearable computers with audiovisual recording capability are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to become so commonplace that you'll have to assume anything you do in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public is being picked up on someone's camera. At that point it isn't going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be practical to keep government from doing the same thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do, however, think that we can draw a solid boundary between surveillance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of public and private spaces. Setting up cameras inside someone's home is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far more expensive, less reliable, and more intrusive than putting cameras
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on street lights. It also requires a much greater degree of consent -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stopping the government from putting cameras on their own property is much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; harder than stopping them from putting cameras on yours. Fortunately, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't much prospect of the government ever getting that level of consent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (after all, they would have to put cameras in your bedroom, and almost no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one will go along with that).
