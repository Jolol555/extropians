<P>&lt;&lt; Perhaps I should have been more careful.  No one is
<BR>
&nbsp;disputing the monumental intellectual effort that went
<BR>
&nbsp;into the creation of this Omega Point Theory (have ya
<BR>
&nbsp;read the notes?!).  And, I understand your point about
<BR>
&nbsp;the battle against entropy.  Nonetheless, the kind of
<BR>
&nbsp;omnipotence you're positing could create far more
<BR>
&nbsp;diversity out of its own resources than it would out
<BR>
&nbsp;of recreating a *very* primitive algorithm like a 20th
<BR>
&nbsp;century human mind file.
<BR>
&nbsp;And, if we grant that such an entity exists, then I
<BR>
&nbsp;would agree that it follows that this being could very
<BR>
&nbsp;well already possess all the knowledge it needed to
<BR>
&nbsp;reproduce a person's mind.  But, the wall that we once
<BR>
&nbsp;again run into is - why do it?
<BR>
&nbsp;[Hint : I don't think sentimentality is a valid
<BR>
&nbsp;answer].  
<BR>
&nbsp;So, the argument comes full circle... &gt;&gt;
<BR>
The answer might be because it produces new information, which mind be useful 
<BR>
to the mind the re-runs tha past, not available as a lower level of 
<BR>
implementation. Also, yes, there are notes in the back as there are all 
<BR>
through Barrow and Tipler's Final Anthropic Principle.  Or you can also look 
<BR>
at Tipler &amp; Co. most recent paper, if you'd like.

Title: Closed Universes With Black Holes But No Event Horizons As a Solution 
<BR>
to the Black Hole Information Problem.
<BR>
Authors: Frank J. Tipler, Jessica Graber, Matthew McGinley, Joshua 
<BR>
Nichols-Barrer, Christopher Staecker
<BR>
Comments: 27 pages in LaTex2e, no figures
<BR>
<P>My point is that theorists like Moravec, Tipler, or Max Tegmark, suggest that 
<BR>
intelligent life will have use of such primatives as we, and quite possibly 
<BR>
not for cheap entertainment (Crusty the Clown?) David Deutsch at Oxford 
<BR>
believes that possibly one of the *persona of the massively, distant, future 
<BR>
will stir our ashes again; but that's no garauntee.On the other hand 
<BR>
hobbyists often do go that extra step, now don't they? 
<BR>
<P>We haven't really dealt with Ed Friedkin on this list much, have we? He and  
<BR>
physicist, Seth Lloyd hold that the basis of the universe at the planck level 
<BR>
must be information. The wheel is still in spin or iso-spin, so many things 
<BR>
un-dreamed might be possible way way way down the road.
