<P>|It's a hoax. According to CBS, Janet Reno did not appear on 60 Minutes in
<BR>
|1994. More to the point, even if she had made such an appearance and even if
<BR>
|she did hold this unlikely opinion, the Attorney General would not have dared
<BR>
|publicly utter such impolitic words, which essentially consign every
<BR>
|practicing Christian in the United States to the status of &quot;cultist&quot; and a
<BR>
|&quot;threat&quot; to the society.
<BR>
<P>It appears as if Rob Sweeney &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rjs@rsie.com?Subject=Re:%20Reno%20&quot;quote&quot;%20(was:%20Re:%20The%20Pause%20that%20Refreshes)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200006060900.LAA00956@color.sics.se&gt;">rjs@rsie.com</A>&gt; commented:

<BR>
|(not that I'd necessarily agree that she wouldn't have &quot;dared publicly
<BR>
|utter such impolitic words&quot;, given her degree of political cluelessness,
<BR>
|but if she had, I suspect we'd have long since heard the uproar through
<BR>
|mainstream media.  Not that the quote isn't believable.)
<BR>
<P>It would seem probably that the ``quote'' originated from inside the United
<BR>
States immune system. Maybe it started as a ``off the record'' comment by
<BR>
some official, and was finally expanded into an ``official quote'' by Rumour,
<BR>
the wellknown ventriloquist?
