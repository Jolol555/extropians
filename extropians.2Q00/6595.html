<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The romantic notion that discoveries are made by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; heroic individuals out of thin air is pure Hollywood--inventions are made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by whoever is in the right place at the right time to make connections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; between, generalizations of, and extrapolations from the common knowledge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can't say I believe this.  The force behind Crocker's argument is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that &quot;just one person&quot; can't matter; it's that the &quot;just one people&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saved by Welfare grants to nine-year-olds are no more or less likely to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be significant than the &quot;just one people&quot; whose lives or educations are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preserved by a properly functioning market economy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The theory that one individual can't have an impact is just as much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hollywood as the romance of the single inventor, except based on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; belief in the world's destiny and meaning and coherence - instead of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destiny of one person.  In reality, it's all just quarks, and while we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may find it disturbing to think of a world's destiny as something so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fragile that it could depend on one person, there is no reason why this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shouldn't be so.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we really agree here: of course individuals have impact: I just
<BR>
think in 99% of those cases it's not because of anything special about
<BR>
the particular human involved.  Even most of the giants we revere as
<BR>
the great thinkers of our time: Newton, Darwin, Maxwell, et al., had
<BR>
ideas that were maybe a few years ahead of when somebody else would
<BR>
have found them.  Leibniz discovered calculus too.  One of Kepler's
<BR>
students no doubt would have fallen upon the discovery that quadratic
<BR>
equations fit nicely the planetary motions if you put them in the
<BR>
right place, and they also nicely describe falling rocks.  Feynmann
<BR>
showed how one can derive Maxwell's equations from a few assumptions.
<BR>
Without Einstein, Michaelson and Morely probably would have done
<BR>
their experiment to measure the ether, failed, and come up with
<BR>
relativity to explain their failure.  The folks who got there first
<BR>
may well have been geniuses, but they're still just a few ticks up
<BR>
the bell curve, not completely separate from it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Our world has no coherence, only causality.  We can die as easily as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live.  Plans can succeed or fail from any cause at all.  A world without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coherence is a dangerous place to live.  That, after all, is what makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Singularity necessary.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, and that's rather the point: and individual /can/ have a huge
<BR>
impact, but for purely chaotic and unpredictable reasons.  It's not
<BR>
that one kid's life won't make a difference in the world: it's that we
<BR>
have no way to know /which/ kid'd life will change the world until he
<BR>
or she actually does it.  The person who builds the first nanoassembler
<BR>
will change the world.  Who will it be?  Whoever is in the right place
<BR>
at the right time.
