</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think so.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh I am aware of that.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As he said what his reasons are?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The usual socialist garbage, essentially its the old 'people are no damn good and need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other people to tell them whats best for them' mantra.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, is it possible for you to describe this without passing it through
<BR>
your internal filters? A URL? I'm completely aware of your politics, and
<BR>
you're not going to sway me, so just the facts please ma'am.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Oh right so he's a good guy.  I thought you thought he was a bad guy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You might think so, I do not.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Man, you are SO restrained since the last time this bounced between us.
<BR>
What happened?
<BR>
<P>(I'm not asking you to flare up, it's just that I sent that post, and
<BR>
realised who it was addressed to, and gritted my teeth)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Given the current polarisation of the world towards US hegemony, a world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; govt would be a good idea, but I'd rather no governments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Considering that the current UN peace keeping force in Sierra Leone can't seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shoot its way out of a wet paper bag, and is the largest source of weapons supply for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the communist rebels (sounds like  Pournelle novel, doesn't it?) 
</EM><BR>
<P>I try to avoid reading that dickhead's books.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; while the private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mercenary forces previously sent in by both the South African gov't and the domestic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sierran government were keeping things well under control until kicked out by UN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mandate, the UN is possibly the worst possible organization to look out for individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liberty around the world.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who mentioned the UN?  Not I.
<BR>
<P>The rest of the world is totally aware as to who controls the UN, I
<BR>
doubt it is seen as representative of the planet outside the US and
<BR>
Europe, and I'm not so sure the Europeans feel this way.
<BR>
<P><P>I was thinking of something else.
<BR>
And no, I don't want to live under one world govt, mainly because it
<BR>
would result in the entire world eventually becoming homogenous and
<BR>
bland.  Other than the cultural diversity issues, the sooner the
<BR>
better.  If we can't get rid of these horrible nation-states entirely,
<BR>
at least let's have just one so we can avoid titanic wars.
