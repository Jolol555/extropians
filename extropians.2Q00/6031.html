<P>Anders, *you have* a good reputation, and I am honored to be
<BR>
associated with you.  I dont recall ever seeing an unkind word from
<BR>
you or even a micoflame, even against those who richly deserve
<BR>
it.  {8-]  However there are posters to this list that I hope I am
<BR>
never associated with, (and they surely feel likewise about me)
<BR>
and I have no control over what they post.
<BR>
<P>There are many cases where we quote a previous post then
<BR>
refute that stated viewpoint.  Any debate opponent doing a
<BR>
keyword search would get hits with someone else's quote with
<BR>
our name on it.  If they wanted, they could delete out our
<BR>
comment and quote someone elses words under our name.
<BR>
<P>I dont know how to deal with deniability of archived posts
<BR>
other than to request a complete version of any quoted post
<BR>
and a request to confirm my authorship.    spike
