<EM>&gt; Now, I don't know all that much about Java (as opposed to EJB), but what I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have heard doesn't sound nearly as free-wheeling as what you describe. Don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vendors need Sun's stamp of approval to call their products &quot;Java&quot;? They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly do to advertise them as an &quot;Enterprise JavaBeans&quot; implementation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And if the standard is freely extensible, how did Microsoft get sued for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writing their own extensions?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My impression is that Sun retains the right to say who can sell Java
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementations and what features they can include, and uses this to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sure no one does anything they don't approve of with the standard.
</EM><BR>
<P>Microsoft was sued for breaching their contract with Sun, in which
<BR>
they explicity agreed to maintain compatibility with Sun's test suites
<BR>
for all versions, in exchange for getting access to some of Sun's
<BR>
source code.  That's not a matter of Sun asserting ownership, it's a
<BR>
simple matter of Microsoft agreeing to a deal and then breaking it.
<BR>
<P>As I said, Sun does maintain a trademark on the name.  But the platform
<BR>
itself can be implemented by anyone, and has been by folks like Kaffe
<BR>
and Transvirtual, and those implementations of the platform will always
<BR>
be available no matter what Sun does, and can be extended at will without
<BR>
Sun's blessing.  Of course, they generally do try to keep up with Sun's
<BR>
changes because Sun's community process for making new APIs generally
<BR>
produces pretty good ones.  But there's no legal reason they have to.
<BR>
In fact there are many non-compatible extensions available as well like
<BR>
GJ/Pizza, iContract, and others.  There are also other languages that
<BR>
run on the Java platform like Eiffel and Python.
<BR>
<P>EJB is another whole ball of wax, and I don't know that anyone really
<BR>
cares about it.  It is the Java platform that has made a difference in
<BR>
the world.
