<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; One comedian had the best idea I have ever heard. Make inmates peddle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  bikes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  all day and night to provide electricity for the whole nation. No one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  ever want to go back after ten years of that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Ironically, this is precisely what was proposed by Jeremy Bentham, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &quot;godfather&quot; of &quot;liberal progressivism&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  One of the founding fathers of Utilitarianism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; His ideal prison and &quot;work house&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; plan called for prisoners and the indigent to work treadmills to produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; power for industry (c. late 18th, early 19th century, when the idea was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; conceived).  I believe the ideas was actually tried.  As it turned out,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Bentham's plans produced disastrous results.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Not that I'm for this whole idea, but what were the &quot;disastrous results&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>The reform of the &quot;Poor Laws&quot; along Benthamite lines in the 1830s was one of 
<BR>
the first great acts of &quot;social engineering&quot; and counts as the first modern 
<BR>
instance of &quot;welfare reform&quot;.  Bentham's master plan for work houses was 
<BR>
instituted, with every aspect of the daily life of their inmates regulated 
<BR>
&quot;scientifically&quot;.  
<BR>
<P>One of the fundamental premises of Bentham's theory was that the standard of 
<BR>
life in the poor houses should be below that of the lowest-paid workers in 
<BR>
the general economy, to produce an incentive to work.  That standard was so 
<BR>
low that the poor houses became hellish prison camps.  Fortunately, attacks 
<BR>
against them on humanitarian and constitutional grounds soon swept them away. 
<BR>
&nbsp;The failure of the Benthamite poor houses counts as one of the earliest 
<BR>
failures of centralized technocratic social engineering. (See &quot;Cities in 
<BR>
Civilization&quot;, Sir Peter Hall, pp. 675-83)
