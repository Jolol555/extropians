<P><EM>&gt; I agree, and the &quot;GNR technologies&quot; (to borrow Bill Joy's term) are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the key to solving this problem, as well as the CAtS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Cheap Access to Space) problem. 
</EM><BR>
[snip]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; so genetic engineering, nanotechnology and robotics will create the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; background and tool-set for really exploiting the resources of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solar system.  The truth is that 20th century technology just wasn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up to the job.  Mid-21st century technology will be.
</EM><BR>
<P>In reading Greg's post, and feeling the way he does (as a &quot;child of
<BR>
the Apollo era&quot;), I agree *in emotional wishing*, however, I am forced
<BR>
to reconcile dreams of cur-humans with realities of post-humans.
<BR>
<P>In a nutshell, Dyson picked the wrong planet.  Disassembling Jupiter
<BR>
is an &quot;afterthought&quot; of the coming era.  There *is* an optimal way
<BR>
to harvest the energy and matter of our solar system, and one
<BR>
meritable goal of the human race sould be to harvest it as quickly
<BR>
and efficently as possible.  Why?  Simply because the computational
<BR>
power derived from this effort would &quot;save&quot; the greatest number of
<BR>
existing humans.  The net result of my analysis to date on this
<BR>
indicates that some combination of Mercury, Venus, the asteroids
<BR>
and perhaps the Moon and/or Mars can be theoretically reorganized 
<BR>
on timescales on the order of approximately *1* year.  Now material
<BR>
resources may make the theoretical limits unattainable, but the real
<BR>
limits should not be orders of magnitudes away from the theoretical
<BR>
limits.
<BR>
<P>So, if you have self-replicating programmable machines (even without
<BR>
*true* molecular nanoassembly!), then &quot;exploration&quot; of the solar
<BR>
system, as envisioned by many science fiction writers is a pipe dream.
<BR>
[Why explore it when you can build something useful out of it?]
<BR>
To argue in support of the goal of exploration over the goal of
<BR>
building sufficient computational capacity as rapidly as possible
<BR>
[to hold uploads and backup copies], is in my opinion unconscionable.
<BR>
<P>Because the technologies for CAtS develop at the same time as those
<BR>
that allow morphing the solar system into something much more useful,
<BR>
I would argue that &quot;exploration&quot; by individuals, as was done in
<BR>
the Apollo missions, is unlikely to ever occur again.  If you
<BR>
want to do it, there will be VR simulators for it!
<BR>
<P>Note, that I do feel there is an argument for a &quot;humanity backup&quot;.
<BR>
In essence, this would be a sustainable human breeding colony and
<BR>
&quot;the library of congress&quot; at an off-earth site, to counter the
<BR>
small probability of a near earth astroid sterilizing the planet.
<BR>
However, current Missions-to-Mars (Mars-Direct) efforts, *are not*
<BR>
directed at creating this before GNR development can reasonably
<BR>
be anticipated, and so are, IMO, relatively worthless.
