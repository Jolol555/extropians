Take A Deep Breath
<BR>
<P>MARKET OBSERVATIONS - 4/18
<BR>
<P>The Fingerprints Of A Secular Top?...No matter how wild this market action
<BR>
seems, once again, this type of activity is not without precedent. 
<BR>
As you know, market periods exhibiting characteristic similarity are ones found
<BR>
in historical extreme circumstances.  A week or so ago, we
<BR>
trotted out our &quot;return engagement&quot; chart for the price volatility surrounding
<BR>
the '29 final top period.  There were a few days in the current market two weeks
<BR>
ago that were dead ringers for a few days of activity directly preceding the
<BR>
&quot;final bell&quot; in 1929.  Well if you thought that similarity was eerie, what till
<BR>
you see what happens next:
<BR>
...
<BR>
<P><P>***...We are simply stunned that the market of today could be so closely
<BR>
repeating almost the exact experience of the 1929 top.  Seriously.  We never
<BR>
thought we would see something like this actually unfold. ...***
<BR>
<P><P>4.     Will the public panic?   At the moment, the answer is NO.  We still
<BR>
believe that ultimately the answer will turn to a strong YES.  As you know,
<BR>
there was virtually no true fear exhibited last week.  $8.4 billion came into
<BR>
mutual funds for the week ended 4/12.  Bullish sentiment numbers actually
<BR>
increased last week as reported by Barrons.  For now, the dangerous casino mind
<BR>
set stands.  We have not yet broken the &quot;who wants to be a millionaire?&quot;
<BR>
mentality. 
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
6.     Are all the contrarian signs there for a meltdown in the broader tech
<BR>
groups?  YES   History shows that there has NEVER been an
<BR>
instance where a financial mania or asset bubble has ended in any way other than
<BR>
badly.  There are no soft landings for asset bubbles. 
<BR>
<P>7.     Is the stock market rational?   From a long term perspective, the answer
<BR>
is YES.   Short term movements are anything but rational.   The
<BR>
market is an exercise in crowd behavior.  Today, it is simply an online study in
<BR>
human nature.
