<EM>&gt; Should be simple to arrange. Michael, you and I send say $1000 to someone we

<EM>&gt; both trust (Greg Birch, I suggest). You sign up with a professional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psychologist for an IQ test, Brian does the same, etc., etc. (we'll need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hammer out those &quot;etc.s&quot; - verification will be tricky but not impossible).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Loser pays additional money in the amount of the cost of the test, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps some amount for time spent dealing with this.

What IQ test is going to be used? I've done numerous ones. However Brians status as an idiot or not is not worth $1000 to me, and frankly, I don't put much trust in the sanity of psychologists, they tend to get into psychology in order to figure out their own sanity. Every therapist I've ever known has been more interested in analysing themselves than their patients. Moreover, Brian's particular brand of idiocy I doubt very much can be reflected in an IQ test.

<P>I never thought I would see Mike back down from a fight!  I suppose if Brian had slapped Mike in the face with a pair of white gloves we might be seeing a  transhumanist duel of the intellects take place.  But we know those I.Q. tests are just worthless anyway. ;)
