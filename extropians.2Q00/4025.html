<P>WOW this was a great post, Hal, thanks!  You are so right.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I looked back at the archive for two years ago, and I saw many familiar

<EM>&gt; names who were once active but who have not posted recently...

<P>Yes, den Otter, where has that guy gone?  He and the others are
<BR>
suddenly missed, now that you mention their names.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm sure most of these people are doing fine, and have just gone on to

<EM>&gt; other things.  But it is strange to have all these departed ones who are

<P>Hal, I am on a mathematical list that is pretty international.  There was
<BR>
a poster from Britain who was active, posting nearly every day, patiently
<BR>
answering newby questions, etc, a real mathematical saint.  With bad
<BR>
kidneys.  He was undergoing treatment, but they didnt have lithotrypsy
<BR>
available in his part of Britain. The treatment went wrong and he
<BR>
ended up with an infection.  He was talking about selling a bunch of
<BR>
possessions to come to America for treatment, but his posts dwindled and he
<BR>
eventually disappeared never to return about a year and a half ago.
<BR>
No one on the list knew him in the flesh.  We must sadly assume he
<BR>
perished.  There was no memorial service by his list buddies, just
<BR>
a bunch of messages imploring him to check in if he was lurking,
<BR>
which he evidently wasnt.  {8-[  Damn.  spike
