<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Thank you for your post.  I guess you have put your finger on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something that has been bothering me.  Is this site strictly about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussions of how to terraform Mars and similar but non-immediate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems or is there anyone, like me, interested in discussing how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to live long enough to get there with the youth and wealth to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enjoy it?  I don't think the two discussions are mutually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exclusive: they are both important and IMHO equally fascinating. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Or to open the discussion still wider; am I asking my questions in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the wrong arena?  Is there another site that I should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;addressing?
</EM><BR>
<P>Your Welcome.
<BR>
<P>Ron, you're in the right place. Sometimes here on the list we're so
<BR>
busy discussing the big ideas that little ideas can get lost, but
<BR>
they are totally appropriate here.
<BR>
<P>Here in Chicago this morning the Mayor is in the hospital for
<BR>
weekend chest pain, and has already been diagnosed with
<BR>
hypertension.
<BR>
<P>Like myself until a less than a year ago, he was a regular
<BR>
exerciser but hadn't been to a doctor in 10 years. Now we've both
<BR>
learned our lesson, and hopefully he'll follow my lead in going to
<BR>
the doctor every year. ;)
<BR>
<P>Yes there are everyday things we should do. Among these are a good
<BR>
diet, regular exercise, plenty of good water and rest. I suggest
<BR>
adding a good supplement program, and for extropians over 40
<BR>
regular visits with a good doctor.
<BR>
<P>I think it helps to share little things we've each learned. 
<BR>
<P>Like most guys I like my Friday nights out, it usually boys night
<BR>
out so we used to go out and paint the town red, on Sat anyone who
<BR>
wasn't married usually went out and gave it a second coat.
<BR>
<P>Unlike most guys, about a year and a half ago I started taking an
<BR>
aspirin a day as a preventive protocol for my heart. Less than a
<BR>
year latter I started having stomach problems which I attributed to
<BR>
too many nights out with the guys, so I started cutting back. Still
<BR>
had problems and they started getting worse. So I finally went to
<BR>
the doctor when the heart attack like symptoms started and got
<BR>
acquainted with prilosec instead.
<BR>
<P>It turns out we've now learned that drinking alcohol (even
<BR>
occasionally) while taking aspirin can cause an exponential
<BR>
increase in gastic problems. This started turning up after lots of
<BR>
us early adopters started getting sick. So if you like your suds,
<BR>
don't take aspirin (or tylenol).
<BR>
<P>It gave me a great excuse to up and plain quit. 
<BR>
<P>I still go out with the gang, and we all benefit cause we have a
<BR>
built in DD these days.

There is an Investingnode available here to members of the extropy
<BR>
institute, so I would recommend becoming a member if your budget
<BR>
will allow. It is fairly low traffic, but has an extremely high S/N
<BR>
ratio.
<BR>
<P>Feel free to bring up what ever you like.
