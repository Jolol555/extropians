<P><EM>&gt;Can I add something to my original question?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think that (real, true) works of art (paintings, sculptures, etc.) last 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for ever and ever. Meaningful. Timeless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That is, in my opinion, a sort of supreme, old, extropy.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is true...many poets, musicians, artists etc. have spoken about their
<BR>
own immortality being secured in their art; the unfortunate part is that so
<BR>
far, none have been able to see that immortality.  But I wonder how much of
<BR>
it is a bona fide desire for some kind of immortality, and how much of it
<BR>
is mere prestige.
<BR>
<P>The other thing that should be noted is that this &quot;timelessness&quot; is by no
<BR>
means specific just to art...it is inherent within the creation of concepts
<BR>
and perspectives.  The underlying desire for &quot;immortality in name&quot; is shown
<BR>
by scientists and philosophers as well --one example being the naming
<BR>
process of some discoveries.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As a qualitative (but not merely subjective) information the work of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;art travels, in time, interacting with people, preserving the secret, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the magic meaning.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure that most art interacts; I think it is rather the individual
<BR>
interpretation that makes a work of art valuable.  I find no value
<BR>
whatsoever in the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; though admire some of Da Vinci's &quot;lesser&quot;
<BR>
works.  There are two aspects to art: the objective --the artist has an
<BR>
absolute state of mind when his art is created...if one could make a
<BR>
neuromolecular &quot;movie&quot; of an artist's brain over the span of his creation
<BR>
(not to mention, have the ability to interpret it), one could conceivably
<BR>
understand the objective value of the work in question.  The other aspect
<BR>
is the subjective --without having the aforementioned objectivity, the art
<BR>
connoisseur either makes guesses at the artist's state of mind, or develops
<BR>
a wholly individualistic interpretation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Science laws are quantitative, objective, but not final.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm.  But we have to assume that they are valid until proven otherwise.  A
<BR>
statement such as &quot;carbon is the base element of the universe&quot; may not be
<BR>
final (we've only explored an infinitessimal portion of the universe to any
<BR>
degree), but it is presumably correct until it is proven incorrect.  Tying
<BR>
this back in with art, the artwork may be &quot;final&quot; (unless it is destroyed),
<BR>
but the interpretations never are.
<BR>
<P>On a final note, I personally believe that art and science are deeply
<BR>
related on the fundamental level of &quot;concept.&quot;  They both possess the
<BR>
catalyst of creation and discovery, and the desire for integrity and purity
<BR>
is crucial to both.  I have yet to see any work of art or science detract
<BR>
from this.
