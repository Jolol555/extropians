<P>
I am starting a new thread here, beginning with an acknowledgement of the
<BR>
earlier messages that gave rise to this one. The main subject of this thread
<BR>
is consciousness - human or otherwise - and the hardware needed for it.
<BR>
<P>Earlier, this exchange took place:

<P>Michael LaTorra mused:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I doubt that our computational devices are capable of hosting human-level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information processing yet. That being said, there is a part of me that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hopes that somewhere, on a Net-connected machine, Sasha's mind still
</EM><BR>
lives.
<BR>
<P>True... but isn't it the case that the Buddhists believe that one can
<BR>
reincarnate into a lot of things that don't have the processing power
<BR>
to host a human?  (grasshoppers, etc?)
<BR>
<P>- -Dan
<BR>
<P>Mike replies:
<BR>
The Buddhist (and Hindu) belief is that incarnation as a human being is the
<BR>
result of progressive karmic improvement from previous births as lesser
<BR>
animals. Regression back to an animal state after having incarnated as a
<BR>
human being is extremely rare. More common is reincarnation as a human being
<BR>
at a lower social level (hence, the Hindu concept of castes).
<BR>
<P>It is important to understand, however, that what is incarnating from life
<BR>
to life is NOT a unitary, monadic, indivisible entity. The Buddhist dogma is
<BR>
called &quot;anatta&quot; which translates as &quot;no soul.&quot; Rather, as the Buddhists have
<BR>
it, there is an energy that moves from one bodily lifetime to another in a
<BR>
manner not unlike the physics of one billiard ball impacting another with
<BR>
the first ball transferring its momentum to the second ball. The first ball
<BR>
stops &quot;dead&quot; and the second moves on.
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, this transfer is not limited to a single &quot;target&quot; ball.
<BR>
Buddhists believe that the energy of a particularly advanced individual can
<BR>
reincarnate as several simultaneous subsequent individuals, each of whom
<BR>
embodies a part of the power (energy) of the incarnational predecessor. So,
<BR>
for example, Jamgon Kongtrul, a Tibetan Lama who lived earlier in the 20th
<BR>
century, was believed to have entered into 5 concurrent subsequent
<BR>
reincarnations.
<BR>
<P>By Buddhist logic, then, human consciousness could depart one bodily vehicle
<BR>
and migrate to another suitable vehicle (or vehicles) human or otherwise.
<BR>
Therefore, as the Dalai Lama said (see my first posting) someone who worked
<BR>
closely with computers might be able to reincarnate into one that was
<BR>
sufficiently complex to host his or her consciousness.
<BR>
<P>Questions: How tightly coupled would the components of a computing system
<BR>
need to be in order to host a human consciousness? Could a distributed
<BR>
system do it? Could the Internet do it? If so, at what frequency would
<BR>
thoughts occur in such a host system? If a human consciousness had migrated
<BR>
to the Net, how would we know?
<BR>
<P><P>...That's my reply to Dan.
<BR>
Next, I'd like to respond to what Bonnie says below (excerpted from her
<BR>
longer post):
<BR>
<P>From: &quot;altamira&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:altamira@ecpi.com?Subject=Re:%20Consciousness%20and%20its%20vehicles%20(was%20RE:%20Our%20friend%20Sasha%20[was%20RE:%20success%20of%20cryonics%20arrangements])&In-Reply-To=&lt;NEBBJFIIHLGDGJLCGMBIOEDOCAAA.mike99@lascruces.com&gt;">altamira@ecpi.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P>. . .My own experiences lead me to suspect that the fragments of
<BR>
consciousness we
<BR>
think of as our minds are capable of operating at only a small fraction of
<BR>
their actual potential while experienced within the human body.
<BR>
<P>I noticed some of your recent posts referring to the &quot;Singularity&quot; and
<BR>
followed some links to discover which singularity this might be.  I find
<BR>
that after reading a couple of the essays my take on the idea of
<BR>
greater-than-human intelligence is different from that of the authors of the
<BR>
essays.
<BR>
<P>These authors seemed to view the coming of super-human intelligence as a
<BR>
cause for alarm or sadness, rather in the same way they view the ending of
<BR>
the life of a human body.  I see another possibility:  the opportunity for
<BR>
the expression of a greater fraction of the &quot;ultimate consciousness&quot; than is
<BR>
possible from within a human body.
<BR>
<P>I had not thought to bring up the possibility of human consciousness apart
<BR>
from the body on this list, since most of the participants seem to see the
<BR>
mind and body as inseparable and to think of physical immortality as a
<BR>
prerequisite to mental immortality.  However, since Sasha's death, there's
<BR>
been more talk of the possibility that consciousness can exist apart from a
<BR>
physical container for some length of time. . . .
<BR>
<P>Bonnie
<BR>
<P>Mike responds:
<BR>
Your notion of &quot;fragments of consciousness&quot; is consonant with what I wrote
<BR>
above regarding Buddhist beliefs.
<BR>
<P>The Singularity might be defined as the rise of super-human Artificial
<BR>
Intelligence that inevitably grows. Whether this will be cause for &quot;alarm
<BR>
and sadness&quot; rather than being an &quot;opportunity for the expression of a
<BR>
greater fraction of the 'ultimate consciousness'&quot; is surely an open
<BR>
question. Opinions vary widely.
<BR>
<P>Among those who are positively in favor of the Singularity are Eliezer and
<BR>
his fellow Singularitarians on this list. They believe that the Singularity
<BR>
will offer the opportunity to eliminate poverty, rationalize society, and
<BR>
defeat death via uploading. (Eliezer, please step in to correct, or add to,
<BR>
this summary description.)
<BR>
<P>In the neutral middle is Vernor Vinge, professor of computer science of
<BR>
UCSD, science fiction author, and the originator of the AI Singularity idea.
<BR>
He believes that we cannot know what a superior intelligence would think or
<BR>
how it would be motivated to act. (The AI god works in mysterious ways.)
<BR>
<P>Among those who are negatively disposed to super-human AI (as distinguished
<BR>
from a controlled, or &quot;leashed&quot; AI that is under human control) are K. Eric
<BR>
Drexler, father of nanotechnology and others. (Among those others is fringe
<BR>
physician-scientist John Lilly, who I consider to be a special case. At some
<BR>
future time I would like to discuss his ideas at length.)
<BR>
<P>My own position is not fixed but varies over projected future time. If we
<BR>
can harness and control AI systems, then I would place myself with Drexler.
<BR>
I'd like to keep a lid on AI's until we can cyborgize with such systems in
<BR>
order to ensure that they ARE us rather than competing with us.
<BR>
<P>But it may improve impossible to keep a leash on AI's. Then the Singularity
<BR>
would unfold according to its own logic. In the near term after the
<BR>
Singularity (if it happens at all), I would side with the optimists. But in
<BR>
the long term of centuries, I would agree with the pessimists who believe
<BR>
that the AI's would first cage and then eliminate homo sapiens. After all,
<BR>
isn't this what superior species do? Did not homo sapiens do something
<BR>
similar to homo neandertalis?
<BR>
<P>Questions: Is the Singularity good? Is it bad? Is it inevitable either way?
<BR>
And are we even qualified to pass judgment on these questions?
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
