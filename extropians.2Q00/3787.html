<EM>&gt; Yes, I've included my comments, mainly pointing out where the writer is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either forgetting something, or is completely wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course.  Was the writer ever right?
<BR>
<P>Before going on let me state, I don't agree with all that Mr. Thomas says in
<BR>
his article.  A lot of it is hyperbole -- of which I'm often guilty of
<BR>
too!:/ -- and some of it appears to a piling on more and more arguments in
<BR>
hopes that enough of them will be right to sway the reader to agree with all
<BR>
of them.  But I don't agree with Michael S. Lorrey's _seeming_ whitewash of
<BR>
the US's role in every war mentioned in the article.  (Note:  I wrote
<BR>
&quot;seeming&quot; there.  I don't think Lorrey really believes that.  I point this
<BR>
out for the people on this list who like to put words in my posts that
<BR>
weren't there or take them out when it will make their arguments appear
<BR>
&quot;better, stronger, faster.&quot;)

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; MORALITY OF NATO'S BALKAN VICTORY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by Raju G. C. Thomas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Historical Justice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;             The victors of wars habitually claim that God and morality
</EM><BR>
were on their side, and that they were incapable of committing crimes. Only
<BR>
the anquished are&gt; war criminals deserving of all the punishment. In the
<BR>
Versailles Peace treaty of 1919, at end of the First World War, Germany was
<BR>
punished severely through the&gt; imposition of exorbitant economic
<BR>
reparations. More significantly it was compelled, on French insistence, to
<BR>
accept a &quot;guilt clause.&quot; Some 19,000 soldiers were&gt; identified by the
<BR>
Entente powers as war criminals at the end of the First World War, none of
<BR>
them British, French, Russian, or American.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My comments:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The American Army regularly punished its own who were found by courts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; martial to have committed war crimes, though I cannot speak for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; British, French, or Russian armies (note that the Russian Army had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pulled out of the war in 1917 after the Bolshevik Revolution and signed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their own armistice with Germany separate from that of the western
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allies, one that included no guilt clause, and which made no demands for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; war crimes to be punished, indeed, the Bolsheviks punished the Czarist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; army officers themselves far more harshly than any other army officers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were in the other armies, including the Germans.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I think he is overgeneralizing here, though, usually, the losers in any war
<BR>
are always the ones on trial.  Currently, it looks like the Hague will not
<BR>
hear the Yugoslav charge of war crimes against NATO.  Shouldn't they, at
<BR>
least, have their day in court?  (And is bombing a commuter train with
<BR>
people on it a war crime?  Is bombing a TV station a war crime?  What about
<BR>
a sweage treatment plant or water pumping station?  Last I heard, this were
<BR>
not military targets.)
<BR>
<P>The specific example Raju G. C. Thomas uses is WW1.  All nations do have
<BR>
military courts to deal with bad conduct, though I think his point was that
<BR>
in this particular war, no British, French, Russian, or Americans were
<BR>
punished for particular war crimes.  The Soviets don't really count because
<BR>
they had a different ax to grind and, no doubt, their purpose in punishing
<BR>
Czarist officers had more to do with their ideology and making sure there
<BR>
were no strong threats to their regime than with war crimes per se.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;       The atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the firebombing of
</EM><BR>
Tokyo and Yokohama, the demolition of Dresden along with its civilians, were
<BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; subject to war crimes trials. The destruction of the people and land of
</EM><BR>
Vietnam over a period of ten years in the name of freedom are all but
<BR>
forgotten. There were no&gt; apologies made or compensations paid, but instead
<BR>
the Vietnamese were subjected to American economic sanctions for the next
<BR>
quarter-century.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My comments:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Strategic carpet bombing of cities that contained defense facilities was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered by the US to be barbaric, at least in europe, which is why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the US Army Air Forces all used the secret Norden bombing sight for far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more precise bombing attacks on true military targets, while the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; british, who bombed at night, continued to use carpet bombing due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their bombers innacuracy, and the navigational limitations of flying at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; night.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll have to read up on this more.  I've heard otherwise, but want to be
<BR>
sure about this first.  Certainly Dresden was not a military target and was
<BR>
bombed specifically as a nonmilitary target.  Only later did the Allies find
<BR>
out they bombed a lot of POWs there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Carpet bombing of Japanese targets by the US was considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfortunate, but considering the psychotic fanatical loyalty to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emperor of most Japanese people at the time, it was considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary, and considering the lack of respect for the Laws of War that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Japanese showed toward the Chinese people for eight years of prior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; warmaking, it was obvious they did not care to operate by the laws of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; war. Considering the lack of respect for human rights shown by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Germans for Jews, Gypsies, Catholics, Ukrainians, and others, it seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obvious in retrospect that the Germans had no reasonable expectation to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see the allies respect the human rights that the Germans dismissed so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willfully.
</EM><BR>
<P>This sort of logic would justify anything.  That kind of collectivistic
<BR>
thinking is the basis for racism and bigotry of all sorts.  I suppose the
<BR>
Germans and Japanese who did not support their rulers or whose support was
<BR>
immaterial or who were too young to even make such choices are somehow as
<BR>
evil as the regime and its soldiers?
<BR>
<P>I'm not trying to whitewash the Axis nations here.  Their governments were
<BR>
dispacable, but does that justify any action taken against anyone living
<BR>
within their borders?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Likewise, in Vietnam, the US was assisting an internationally recognised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government fight an insurgency backed by a foreign power (North Vietnam,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Russia, and China). That the North Vietnamese Communists and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; southern geurrilla communists refused to operate by the Laws of War when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it was inconvenient for them to do so, but willingly hid behind them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when it was to their advantage shows that they were not to be trusted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obey any international convention, and the fact they treated captured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soldiers and pilots not as prisoners of war should be treated under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Geneva Conventions, but instead labeled them as 'pirates' and 'air
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pirates' so that they could legally torture, maim, brutalize, and kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with impunity, as well as the fact that the southern viet cong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guerrillas frequently attacked completely peaceful civilian targets,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-combatants, and hospital facilities with terrorist bombs illustrates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they had and have no right to claim any sort of victimhood under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Laws of War.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that North Vietnam and the Viet Cong were pretty much evil, but I
<BR>
think the point is that the US government committed many acts of evil too.
<BR>
In such cases, it is best to stay out of the conflict.  The US also, recall,
<BR>
helped to overthrow the elected government of South Vietnam.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;       As the Gulf War drew to its close and Iraq accepted an initial
</EM><BR>
cease-fire that the US rejected, American and British bombers continued to
<BR>
kill thousands of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Iraqi soldiers fleeing across the open desert with no defense. This does
</EM><BR>
not qualify as a &quot;Srebrenica.&quot; And nobody will know how many wounded Iraqi
<BR>
soldiers were&gt; buried alive in the sand by American military bulldozers
<BR>
after the cease-fire because it was too much hassle to check every body
<BR>
lying in the sand.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My Comments:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Iraqis did not accept a cease fire until a full day AFTER the US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; declared unilateral cease fire had gone into effect. The US declared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it would cease operations at a given time and date, and the Iraqis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did not respond until after US combat operations ceased. To counter the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claims of the author, we will never know how many Kuwaiti women were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saved from short lives as pleasure prisoners of Iraqi military units due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the air power induced panic imposed on the Iraqi forces. The raping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and pillaging that the Iraqis committed on the Kuwaiti people, IMHO,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obviated any moral requirement that the Iraqi soldiers be treated with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any respect that normal soldiers deserve. Those soldiers were not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unarmed, they were not non-combatants. Any who surrendered were given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sanctuary, safety, shelter and food (which is far more than they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; received when they were released back to the Iraqi high command, who had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most shot). Under the Laws of War, any armed soldier is a legitimate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; target, irrespective if he is charging or retreating. A wild dog who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flees is just as likely to come back for another nip if you don't break
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him of the habit.
</EM><BR>
<P>I generally agree here the Iraqi military, though I was and am against that
<BR>
war and the continued bombings.  I'm not for Saddam or his style of tyranny
<BR>
(or any for that matter), but I don't see why civilian targets have to be
<BR>
targetted and why the US should support the Kuwaiti regime, which is merely
<BR>
another form of tyranny.  Again, the Iraqi infrastructure and civilians who
<BR>
were targetted were not military targets -- unless one broadens the
<BR>
definition so much as to make the distinction arbitrary and useless.
<BR>
<P>And why does the bombing continue?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Some 1.7 million&gt; innocent Iraqis, mainly children, have died slow
</EM><BR>
deaths because of economic sanctions. But there are no CNN cameras to record
<BR>
this tragedy, and besides they died&gt; because of well-intentioned US policy.
<BR>
Such pain, suffering and tragedy do not count in the American concept of
<BR>
morality. Meanwhile, Iraq is bombed routinely,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; killing untold numbers of soldiers manning military installations or
</EM><BR>
merely sleeping in their barracks, together with other &quot;unintended&quot; Iraqi
<BR>
civilians. These do not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; count as war crimes. They are legitimate targets or collateral damage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yes they are. The children who die cannot be blamed on us. Saddam is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite free to import however much food and medicine as he desires.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately, he turns around and sells that food and medecine on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; black market to generate money to pay for more weapons, weapons systems,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and for building his weapons of mass destruction. This silly argument is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much like the terrorist who shoots a hostage and says to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; negotiator,&quot;Look at what you made me do.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so.  First, what is the goal of the sanctions?  Do you think
<BR>
they will achieve that goal?   If it's to keep Saddam from doing whatever
<BR>
bad he's doing, they are not working.  Second, if a limitation of war is to
<BR>
limit the pain and killing of innocents, then one must ask who do the
<BR>
sanctions hurt more?  To borrow Lorrey's analogy, imagine terrorists do take
<BR>
a house in a neighborhood, would the police be justified in bombing the
<BR>
whole city, killing thousands of innocents in the process?  I don't think
<BR>
so.  I don't think Lorrey would think so either.  Thus, the sanctions are an
<BR>
inappropriate &quot;weapon&quot; here.  The reasoning should never be &quot;because X is
<BR>
evil, any thing we do to stop X is okay, and we can blame X for all the
<BR>
unintended consequences of our actions.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Notably, Saddam has not been stopped.  He continues to rule and seek ways to
<BR>
expand his power, the coalition against fell apart mainly because of the
<BR>
US's and Britain's highhanded policy in the region, and the general lesson
<BR>
every other nation and people is being taught is that might makes right.
<BR>
Kosovo is much the same.  Milosevic is still in power, now the KLA is
<BR>
killing Kosovar Serbs, the genocide that never was is generally ignored
<BR>
because it's not news, Serbia might be bombed out but it's army is intact,
<BR>
and Russia used the American strategy to its advantage in Chechnya.  (How
<BR>
the two -- Chechnya and Yugoslavia -- are different is one that will have to
<BR>
be explained to me.)
<BR>
<P>It's a shame that the American people will have to pay for these mistakes --
<BR>
and not the politicians who make them.  But that's the nature of the beast.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
