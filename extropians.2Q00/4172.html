<P><EM>&gt;This IS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spooky, and has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing to do with bandwidth.  This is metaphysical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humanism, NOT hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science.  (Look at their message!  Why would they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; care about hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science?  Look at how awful their science is!)
</EM><BR>
<P>Sad, but true.  It was a brilliant film with a
<BR>
fascinating ontological thriller theme to it. 
<BR>
Nonetheless, the scientific predictions were, at best,
<BR>
infantile underestimates supported by wave after wave
<BR>
of hollow plot device and cleverly coined
<BR>
phrase...Now, before I regret putting my home phone
<BR>
number in my .sig file, let me once again declare my
<BR>
undying loyality, unswerving devotion, and the full
<BR>
dedication of my immortal soul to the movie!
<BR>
Why?  Because philosophically, they just don't come
<BR>
any better!  Now, each of us here is (probably) some
<BR>
bizarre mix of technophile and transhumanist
<BR>
philosopher [Note : In re-reading this before sending
<BR>
I could hear the trumpets of the epistemology cavalry
<BR>
sounding the charge in the distance - oops!]  Thus,
<BR>
we're probably skeptical to the point that we'd
<BR>
require a ballistics test just to prove we'd been
<BR>
shot!  This movie requires (and, if you saw how they
<BR>
just threw the &quot;techno-explanations&quot; together,
<BR>
invites) us to suspend concern of scientific
<BR>
feasibility in order to focus on the ontological and
<BR>
metaphysical questions it raises.  And those are rich
<BR>
and varied (that has already been amply proven here
<BR>
over the past two weeks - so, I'll spare you!) [yes,
<BR>
you're welcome!  ;-]  Of course there are those among
<BR>
us who think that presently fictitious ontological
<BR>
scenarios, what-ifs, and thought experiments are only
<BR>
some much philosophical hand waving (and, I won't name
<BR>
names, but they might be a brilliant cognitive
<BR>
researcher that lives in Europe and has the initials
<BR>
A.S.).  And, while I am forced to conceed that there
<BR>
is little pragmatic use for such speculations at
<BR>
present, I would remind my esteemed colleague(s) that
<BR>
the very future we embrace and strive to create may
<BR>
prove to be far more metaphysically unsettling than
<BR>
any fictional/imaginary world today's art can
<BR>
conjure...
<BR>
[random example hoping to spawn another string : Star
<BR>
Trek, The Next Generation.  I loved that show as a kid
<BR>
- best thing on TV and probably one of the impetuses
<BR>
behind my latent technophilia.  But, looking back with
<BR>
my modest, but larger, scientific knowledge, I'm
<BR>
appalled!  If I'm hurling through interstellar space
<BR>
in 4 CENTURIES on a giant hunk of composite metals in
<BR>
a smelly primate shell with wonders such as &quot;nanites&quot;
<BR>
that serve no useful function, an onboard computer AI
<BR>
that's really only got the &quot;A&quot; part down, and
<BR>
&quot;diplomatic missions&quot; to colonies of other skin bags,
<BR>
there's gonna be hell to pay!]
<BR>
<P>Sorry, I'm moving tomorrow - there's a lot of pent up
<BR>
stress  ;-)
<BR>
<P>And, to Dan Faublich, I realize your original message
<BR>
had a lot more important content than that which I
<BR>
quoted.  I'm hoping to really get to digest it tonight
<BR>
at home and draft a worthy response.
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
