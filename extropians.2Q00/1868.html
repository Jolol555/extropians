<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Just because a bunch of companies get together and issue a 'standard' does

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; not mean that their work should have any special protections, or that

<EM>&gt; &gt; HTML was not made by a company.  It was first written by a scientist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; looking for a better way to share information, and freely given away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There was no commercial incentive - at least, not until Netscape came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; along.  A number of other widely-supported computer standards - HTTP and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Linux, to name a couple of the more popular ones - similarly had no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; corporate backing before they became popular enough for companies to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; take notice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A government is a monopoly corporation, and that scientist worked for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government institution.
</EM><BR>
<P>Come on, now leave off who he was employed by. He wrote that standard
<BR>
to help create the Web as an common information-sharing medium.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of course that picking nits, but the HTML standard created by CERN would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never have gotten anywhere outside of CERN if some companies had not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jumped on the bandwagon. Netscape has had tremendous influence on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolution of HTML
</EM><BR>
<P>There's quite a space in the history before Netscape got on the scene.
<BR>
The appearance of a commercial browser program was an important point
<BR>
that didn't occur immediately. Mosaic... :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; These other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies all decided to cry and whine when Microsoft came in and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developed its own standards and its own variations on interpreting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standard tags (just as ALL browsers do. none display the same page in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactlyt he same way)
</EM><BR>
<P>It went beyond things just being displayed differently a long time ago.
<BR>
It's quite possible for me to write a page according to the HTML 4.0
<BR>
standard that Internet Explorer &amp; Navigator 4.0 claim to work to, and
<BR>
have it simply *not work* on one or even both of them. Instead, I have
<BR>
to find out the (undocumented!) ways each of these interpret HTML, and
<BR>
work out some way which caters for both.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; microsft came out with ActiveX, and all of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mac=heads who hated microsoft who worked in these new browser companies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (i.e. mostly students right out of school, where they used macs almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exclusively) automatically rejected the standard, rather than embracing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, just because it came from microsoft.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's absolutely incorrect.
<BR>
<P><P><P>ActiveX was rejected (by just about everyone, including people using MS
<BR>
software) primarily because it's a HUGE security problem. 'ActiveX'
<BR>
programs (there's nothing special about them, they're just Windows
<BR>
programs your machine downloads and runs) would load automatically and
<BR>
run with full priveledges on your machine. They could trash your hard
<BR>
disk, read your files, send your data to someone. ActiveX was an
<BR>
absolute *disaster*. 
<BR>
<P>It's only a secondary point It meant people producing content for the
<BR>
Web that was only viewable by people using Microsoft browsers on Intel-
<BR>
based computers.
