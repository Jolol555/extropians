<P>Doctors Advise Circumcision to Prevent HIV Spread
<BR>
<P>By Patricia Reaney
<BR>
<P>LONDON (Reuters) - Australian doctors recommended male circumcision Friday
<BR>
as a means to prevent the spread of the HIV virus that causes AIDS.
<BR>
<P>Their review of previous studies of circumcision and HIV showed that the
<BR>
virus is usually passed through the penis and that men who have been
<BR>
circumcised are two to eight times less likely to become infected with HIV.
<BR>
<P>``Male circumcision should be seriously considered as an additional means
<BR>
of preventing HIV in all countries with a high prevalence of infection,''
<BR>
Professor Roger Short of the University of Melbourne wrote in a report in
<BR>
the British Medical Journal.

<BR>
Short and his colleagues acknowledged that cultural and religious attitudes
<BR>
play a major role in circumcision in many countries but said mounting
<BR>
evidence has proven the benefits.
<BR>
<P>Although circumcising babies is the least complicated procedure, it would
<BR>
not have an impact on HIV transmission rates for 15 to 20 years. The
<BR>
researchers suggested circumcising teenaged boys would be much more effective.
<BR>
<P>``Circumcision at puberty, as practiced by many Muslim communities, would
<BR>
be the most immediately effective intervention for reducing HIV
<BR>
transmission since it would be done before young men are likely to become
<BR>
sexually active,'' Short said.
<BR>
<P>How circumcision prevents HIV infection is still a mystery, but Short and
<BR>
his colleagues believe the inner surface of the foreskin could be the route.
<BR>
<P>The foreskin -- removed during circumcision -- contains cells that have HIV
<BR>
receptors which the researchers suspect are the primary entry point for the
<BR>
virus into the penis.
<BR>
<P>Half of the estimated 50 million people worldwide infected with the HIV
<BR>
virus are men and most have been infected through their penis.
<BR>
<P>``The inner surface of the foreskin, which is rich in HIV receptors and the
<BR>
frenulum (a thin band connecting the inner foreskin) must be regarded as
<BR>
the most probable sites for viral entry in primary HIV infection in men,''
<BR>
Short said.
<BR>
<P>Although they were confident circumcision would help, the researchers said
<BR>
other methods were also needed.
<BR>
<P>``The development of topically active agents that can block HIV binding
<BR>
sites, such as CCR5, and which could be applied to the penis or vagina to
<BR>
create a chemical condom, might be more effective and acceptable than any
<BR>
mechanical or surgical intervention,'' Short added.
