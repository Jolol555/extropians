<EM>&gt;&gt;If you have *nothing* but a variety of accumulating late-acting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;pathologies, that alone will create &quot;aging&quot;: increasing mortality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;plus decreasing function accumulating thoughout life, following 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;a roughly Gompertzian curve.  So the pathologies can indeeed be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the basic cause of aging.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;No, the phenotype of aging does not indicate such an origin. I'll tell you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;why: (1) the large differences in aging phenotypes amongst closely-related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;species indicates simple mechanisms (for example, amongst teleosts); 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't get this reference.  Are you talking about lifetime vs. one-time
<BR>
reproduction in salmon?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(2) Occam's razor: what's easier to evolve, 100 mutations for age-related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;diseases or 10 mutations upstream of age-related diseases; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Every system and most genes can evolve some kind of age-related problem.
<BR>
All of these problems will thus be in mutation-selection balance with
<BR>
the &quot;optimal&quot; alleles.  Any metazoan population will necessarily be variable
<BR>
for thousands of age-related deleterious alleles.  Alleles which 
<BR>
combine several systems together are much more difficult to evolve;
<BR>
the population isn't spewing out thousands per generation.  There is
<BR>
no way to avoid this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(3) Gompertz'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;curve is not a rough one; in human populations it shows a good correlation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(see Hayflick's book) 
</EM><BR>
<P>What we see is what's predicted; close to a Gompertz most of the time;
<BR>
not a Gompertz in youth or old age.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(4) there is only one age-related dysfunction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(presbyopia) that affects all humans; so, unless thousands of back-up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pathologies are constantly at work, your argument does not stand; 
</EM><BR>
<P>There *are* thousands of pathologies.  The phenetic variability of 
<BR>
aging is a problem for *your* theory; you're the one claiming we
<BR>
all have the same aging system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(5) despite what I said in (1), in mammals that is not true. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You've got to make up your mind here.  If similarity of aging is evidence
<BR>
for your theory, variability (1) is evidence against it, and vice
<BR>
versa.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Mammals have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;large amount of similarities in the aging process (read Finch's book for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;references). If aging is just the diseases that evolved due to lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evolutionary pressure in old ages, then larger differences are expected. Yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mice -- with maximum lifespans of 5 years -- have roughly the same diseases
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we do at age 65. And the best (and simpler, I'm sure you can think of other,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more complex and therefore more unlikely, explanations) explanation is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there is a single mechanism causing aging in mammals that in turn leads to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all age-related diseases. 
</EM><BR>
<P>No; the simple explanation is that *everything* goes wrong.  Mammals are
<BR>
all biologically very similar; they have the same things to go wrong.
<BR>
Non-replaceables wear out; proliferation slows, impairing repair,
<BR>
and cancer becomes more common.  These are all very straightfoward.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Read Bowles J, 2000. He makes a good argument against what you just said.
</EM><BR>
<P>Erk!  Didn't you notice that was in Medical Hypotheses?  It didn't even 
<BR>
rate Mechanisms of Aging and Development.  I can't get the article, because 
<BR>
UC Riverside has never gotten that journal and UC Irvine hasn't gotten it 
<BR>
since 1991.  But just looking at the abstract shows me several problems:
<BR>
<P>B&gt;A new thought experiment with competing strains of algae 
<BR>
B&gt;corrects for these issues and shows that aging evolved and is 
<BR>
<P>Well, thought experiments aren't adequate. If you want to support demic 
<BR>
selection, you need to do the population biology or quantitative genetic 
<BR>
models, like Goodnight or Wade do.
<BR>
<P>B&gt;retained so that groups retain enough genetic variability to allow 
<BR>
B&gt;for rapid evolution of a defense to novel predation.
<BR>
<P>This is a serious error.  Aging won't preserve genetic variability, it 
<BR>
will reduce it.  Neutral variation will be the same.  Near-neutral 
<BR>
variation will be *less* in the aging population, due to faster turnover.  
<BR>
When a novel situation comes along, the aging population will *more* 
<BR>
likely have lost the genes to deal with it.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The hypothetical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;antagonistic pleiotropy genes that are beneficial to young while 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;detrimental to old individuals, predicted to exist in the 1950s, are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unlikely to exist, have not, and likely will not be found in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sufficient quantity to participate in the aging process.
</EM><BR>
<P>He needs to read the literature: there have been many demonstrations
<BR>
of antagonistic pleiotropy.  Offhand, I can recall Rose's and Partridge's;
<BR>
there are many, many others.
<BR>
<P>He doesn't mention that an aging population will be far less fit just 
<BR>
because it has a higher death rate.  If the situation is dire to the 
<BR>
point a non-aging population can barely make it, the aging population 
<BR>
will have negative growth due to the extra mortality, and will go 
<BR>
extinct.
<BR>
<P>P.S. I'm not knocking Medical Hypotheses; there's a role for such 
<BR>
journals.  It's just that things published there aren't really evidence
<BR>
for anything.
