<EM>&gt; First off can you explain to me what the difference is between Isp and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fsp, thanks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Isp is specific impulse, the amount of momentum delivered per unit
<BR>
propellant mass:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Isp = Ft/M   m/s
<BR>
<P>This has the units of a velocity, but in the american provincial unit
<BR>
system the distinction between pound mass and pounds force is often
<BR>
swept under the rug, so the equation becomes
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Isp = Ft/(Mg)  seconds
<BR>
<P>Their &quot;Specific Thrust&quot; is just the engine thrust over the burning area
<BR>
and chamber pressure:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fsp = F/(ApPcCF),
<BR>
<P>(The real figure of interest is the thrust/burning area, but they throw
<BR>
in the Pc to make the units dimensionless and make low-pressure
<BR>
operation look good.)  The only real significance is that, if the
<BR>
burning rate is high enough, the burning area need not be much larger
<BR>
than the nozzle throat and an end-burning geometry will work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; First in the marketing section they claim to have validated their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orders of magnitude improvement in thrust through something called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Aerospace Corporation. Ever heard of them?
</EM><BR>
<P>AC is a tame think tank set up by the USAF about 45 years ago.  Beltway
<BR>
bandits who are called in to do due diligence and give a thumbs up or
<BR>
thumbs down.  They tend to come up with the answers they're paid to
<BR>
produce.  In this case they carefully pointed out that yes, this is a
<BR>
good solid rocket fuel, but did not endorse the nozzleless
<BR>
configuration.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; In the technology section they show a graph of how in different kinds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of explosions (conventional explosions vs. thermite) the reactant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diffusion distance is inversely proportional to reaction velocity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Farther away reactants have to move to get to each other, the slower
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the reaction velocity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, with better mixing the propellants burn faster.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; They show a picture of a typical chunk of fuel/oxidizer from regular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fuel- about 200 microns wide (they relate it to a table salt grain),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and then make the claim that whereas in regular fuel this would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a single pair of materials, in their fuel this would contain tens of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; billions of fuel/oxidizer pairs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, with better mixing the propellants burn faster.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Next page is a table showing burn rates and chamber pressures of three
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technologies: stinger (.33 inch/sec and 1300 psi), boeing delta II
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (.23 inch/sec and 800 psi), their end burning rocket (6.8 inch/sec and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 25 psi). Below that is a graph showing Fsp of various rocket types along
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with their burn rates. What that seems to show is most conventional stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such as Shuttle SRB, Titan IV, sidewinder are all grouped near each other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at around .4 burn rate and .005 specific thrust (psi/psi). Meanwhile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they show their caseless motor up close to 8 inch/sec burn rate and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific thrust of 1. Assuming this graph is correct, what are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequences? The graph also shows a different version of their system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is apparently not caseless... this would be used in sidewinders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and such I guess. This one has multiple points along the graph line,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from much slower than the others to about the same point as the caseless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So I guess they are saying they can control the reaction rates pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, with better mixing the propellants burn faster.  Look, I know a
<BR>
bit about making rocket propellants burn faster- the proprietary liquid
<BR>
injector technology we use achieves an Fsp (as they define it) of about
<BR>
6.  The more customary measure of combustion speed is the characteristic
<BR>
length of a combustion chamber, the volume divided by the throat area:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Lstar = Vcham/Athroat 
<BR>
<P>This is an easily measured figure of merit closely related to the
<BR>
residence time of the propellants in the combustor.  Our competitors are
<BR>
happy to get good combustion efficiency with Lstar of about 40 inches;
<BR>
our engines are twenty or less, and for certain propellants we can do
<BR>
about 5.  Since the chamber mass is almost directly proportional to
<BR>
Lstar, XCOR is doing mighty good :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the next page they show a cutway pic of a regular solid rocket motor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vs an end burning. Both show nozzles. They point out that their motors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the highest specific thrust are nozzleless and sometimes caseless,
</EM><BR>
<P>They haven't *built* any rockets- they're only doing propellant
<BR>
combustion tests in open-ended tubes. The highest Isp they've
<BR>
demonstrated is less than half of the state of he art for solids, little
<BR>
more than a third of liquid fuel engines.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and they make the claim that a caseless rocket would be capable of SSTO.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But no real details on how that would work. :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>And it _wouldn't_work_. In the Aerospace Corp report, they wrote: &quot;The
<BR>
highest observed Isp is 114 s.&quot;  Without a nozzle, it ain't gonna get
<BR>
better.  If you plug an Isp of 130 (to be generous to further
<BR>
development) into the rocket equation,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;v = g Isp ln(M/M0)
<BR>
<P>and solve for v = 9000 m/s to get into orbit, the mass ratio needed is
<BR>
about 1200.  Thus if the entire stack is propellant with no parasitic
<BR>
mass (such as some means of *steering* the damn thing!), you'll need
<BR>
1200 kg of propellant for each kg delivered to orbit.  A monster the
<BR>
same mass as the space shuttle stack (2,000,000 kg) would deliver less
<BR>
than 1700 kg to orbit. Conventional solid propellants cost several
<BR>
dollars per pound, and gas-condensed Al isn't likely to make it cheaper-
<BR>
this comes to several thousand dollars per pound of payload.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I guess what I would like to know is what impact if any do these Fsp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and other numbers above have?
</EM><BR>
<P>The high Fsp makes an end-burning solid motor theoretically possible. 
<BR>
It also makes it inherently vulnerable to cracks and disbonds which
<BR>
would lead to overpressurization and case failure.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Here they are flat-out wrong.  Without a de laval nozzle to efficiently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; expand the hot gases to supersonic velocity and collimate the exhaust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well it seems that their reaction rates alone are fast enough to create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the supersonic velocities without having to do anything else.
</EM><BR>
<P>No joy- without high combustion pressure, there is no way to extract
<BR>
enough work from the hot gases to accelerate them up to high velocity. 
<BR>
Either a nozzle with a restricted throat must be used to provide that
<BR>
pressure, or a pulsed detonation cycle can produce high pressure by
<BR>
constant-volume combustion.  With neither, the hot gases cannot do work-
<BR>
and a rocket engine is ultimately a heat engine that does its work on
<BR>
the exhaust gases. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Interesting, but what if you were using their super-well-mixed nano
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aluminium fuel. Could you get an effect like this?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, not with a continuous-combustion process.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The one big bad ugly thing is that any sort of disbond or crack in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; grain would be even more dangerous than for a center-burning motor.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Titan SRMs have a bad habit of blowing up when the buring area increases
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by a few percent from a crack- imagine how critical propellant integrity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be at 100x the burning rate.  A small void that would make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; slower burn rate motor merely hiccup would double the burn rate of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; end-burner... instant pretty fireworks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would this really be a problem if you are burning at the end rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inside a case with a nozzle? At any rate on the web page I cite above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they claim that their fuel has stable burn rates to over 1600 psi.
</EM><BR>
<P>Without a case, you could probably get away with it- but since the
<BR>
performance would suck, why bother?  Put that propellant in a case with
<BR>
a nozzle, and sometimes it will work, but often you'll get fireworks.
<BR>
