Somehow South Africa managed to &quot; find itself&quot; for long enough to reach anagreement that was acceptable to all parties.  This has not happen in Ireland, who can hardly claim to have suffered to a comparable extent.  That this has not happened in N. Ireland in the last few years is not the fault of either the British people or their Gov't (who, for the sheer financial saving, would like to pull out of ireland).  Until all parties really consider giving up their guns a satisfactory trade off, they will never have a stable peace.   Its a case of &quot; guns before  peace.&quot; and the political imaturity of the protagonists (and I am avoiding deliberate finger-pointing ) in being unable to accept the inevitability of compromise in any meaningful negotiated solution in any dispute.

&nbsp;&nbsp;at every opportunity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you'd bothered reading up on the field you might have come across

&nbsp;&nbsp;the interesting statistic that something like 85% of the GB population

&nbsp;&nbsp;favours pulling the GB out of NI and letting the buggers kill each

&nbsp;&nbsp;out what's going on anywhere, is it? Or would you like me to blame you

&nbsp;&nbsp;logically support her?
