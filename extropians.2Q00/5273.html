Subject: News release: Prometheus Awards/Hall of Fame finalists announced!
<BR>
<P>For immediate release:  June 11, 2000
<BR>
<P>Libertarian Futurist Society announces Prometheus Award finalists, Hall of
<BR>
Fame finalists
<BR>
<P>The Libertarian Futurist Society has chosen finalists for its annual
<BR>
Prometheus Award for Best Novel and its annual Prometheus Hall of Fame for
<BR>
Classic Fiction.  The winners will be announced over the Labor Day weekend in
<BR>
Chicago in an awards ceremony at the World Science Fiction Convention.
<BR>
<P>The 1999 Prometheus Award finalists (for the 2000 award):
<BR>
&quot;The Martian Race’&quot; by Gregory Benford  (Warner Aspect)
<BR>
&quot;Cradle of Saturn’&quot; by James Hogan (Baen Books)
<BR>
&quot;The Cassini Division,&quot;’ by Ken MacLeod  (TOR Books)
<BR>
&quot;Cryptonomicon’&quot;  by Neal Stephenson  (Avon Books)
<BR>
&quot;A Deepness in the Sky,&quot;’ by Vernor Vinge  (TOR Books)
<BR>
<P>The 2000 Prometheus Hall of Fame finalists:
<BR>

<BR>
&quot;It Can't Happen Here,&quot;’ by Sinclair Lewis (1930s)
<BR>
&quot;The Wardove,&quot;’ by L. Neil Smith (1980s ?)
<BR>
<P>Both awards honor outstanding science fiction/fantasy that explores the
<BR>
possibilities of a free future, champions human rights (including personal
<BR>
and economic liberty), dramatizes the perennial conflict between individuals
<BR>
and coercive governments, or critiques the tragic consequences of abuse of
<BR>
power-- especially by the  State.
<BR>
<P>The Prometheus Award, sponsored by the Libertarian Futurist Society (LFS),
<BR>
was established in 1979, making it one of the most enduring awards after the
<BR>
Nebula and Hugo awards, and one of the oldest fan-based awards currently in
<BR>
sf.  Presented annually since 1982 at the World Science Fiction Convention,
<BR>
the Prometheus Awards include a gold coin and plaque for the winners.
<BR>
<P>The Hall of Fame, established in 1983, focuses on older classic fiction,
<BR>
including novels, novellas, short stories, poems and plays. Past Hall of Fame
<BR>
awardwinners range from Robert Heinlein and Ayn Rand to Ray Bradbury and
<BR>
Ursula LeGuin.
<BR>
<P>Last year's Prometheus Award winner for Best Book, presented at the Anaheim,
<BR>
Calif. NASFIC, was John Varley’s “The Golden Globe’’ (ACE/Berkley Books).
<BR>
Last year’s Prometheus Award Hall of Fame winner for Classic Fiction was H.
<BR>
Beam Piper and John McGuire’s “A Planet For Texans’’ (1958)-- also known as
<BR>
“Lone Star Planet.’’
<BR>
<P>Michael Grossberg, New Visions sci-fi book columnist at The Dispatch
<BR>
(Columbus, Ohio), chairs the Prometheus Awards Finalist Judges committee. All
<BR>
LFS Advisory members vote on the Prometheus Award from a list of five
<BR>
finalists selected by a 10-member LFS Prometheus Award Finalist judging
<BR>
committee, based on nominations from the entire LFS membership.
<BR>
<P>LFS Director Victoria Varga chaired last year's Prometheus Hall of Fame
<BR>
Finalist Judges committee. All LFS Basic and Advisory members choose the
<BR>
Prometheus Hall of Fame Award from a list of finalists selected by a separate
<BR>
LFS Hall of Fame Finalist judging committee, based on nominations from the
<BR>
entire LFS membership.
<BR>
<P>The Prometheus Award was founded in 1979 when a group led by L. Neil Smith
<BR>
presented the first award to F. Paul Wilson for “Wheels Within Wheels.” Other
<BR>
Prometheus winners include Vernor Vinge, Ken MacLeod, James P. Hogan, Brad
<BR>
Linaweaver, Victor Koman, Poul Anderson, J. Neil Schulman Victor Milan, Larry
<BR>
Niven and Jerry Pournelle, and Smith (who since 1979 has not been associated
<BR>
with the awards judging.)

Subject: Your invitation to join the LFS at its first con next year!
<BR>
<P>I thought you'd be interested in being among the first to hear some
<BR>
exciting official news:  the Libertarian Futurist Society will celebrate its
<BR>
20th anniversary by holding its first national conference over Memorial Day
<BR>
weekend, 2001, in Columbus, Ohio, as part of Marcon 36, Ohio's oldest and
<BR>
largest sci-fi/fantasy convention.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are interested in attending this event-- either under your own
<BR>
steam, if you're a friend or fellow libertarian, or as one of Marcon's or the
<BR>
LFS's special guests of honor, if you're a published novelist-- please let me
<BR>
know before the end of June, if you can.  (Please also include your mailing
<BR>
address, email and regular name, and a contact phone number, so we can send
<BR>
you more info and follow up.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone can attend this fun culturally-oriented event: LFS members,
<BR>
Prometheus Awardwinning novelists, their family and friends, libertarians and
<BR>
sf fans from across the country and the general public.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that: Marcon will offer a special advance discount registration
<BR>
for LFS members, their family and friends, and other libertarians.  While we
<BR>
are planning to  a special LFS membership offer during this next year as part
<BR>
of our 20th anniversary membership drive/celebration, you don't have to join
<BR>
the LFS to join the fun next May 25-27, 2001, in Columbus!!
<BR>
<P>For a free (and fun) future,
<BR>
<P>Michael Grossberg
<BR>
Co-founder, Libertarian Futurist Society
<BR>
Chair, LFS Prometheus Awards Finalist Judging Committee
<BR>
<P>P.S. Here is the full email alert that was just sent out to all online
<BR>
Libertarian Futurist Society members:
<BR>
<P>----------------------------------------
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past three years, LFS members have discussed ways to celebrate our
<BR>
upcoming 20th anniversary in 2001, and whether it's time to hold our first
<BR>
LFS conference.  You may recall reading an article in Prometheus last year
<BR>
proposing that the LFS meet over Memorial Day weekend in 2001 as part of
<BR>
Marcon, Ohio's oldest and largest science fiction, fantasy, media and science
<BR>
convention.
<BR>
<P>Well, now it's official:  Marcon organizers are rolling out the red carpet
<BR>
for us, and LFS leaders have voted in favor of accepting Marcon's very
<BR>
gracious offer.
<BR>
<P>Much more on this later-- in Prometheus and by email-- as we invite and
<BR>
confirm many of the Prometheus Award winning novelists and LFS members that
<BR>
we hope to include on many Marcon panel discussions, etc.
<BR>
<P>But here's the first official announcement, so you can put the dates on your
<BR>
calendar and start planning to join us for what should be the most fun-- and
<BR>
only culturally oriented-- libertarian convention of 2001:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LIBERTARIAN FUTURIST SOCIETY
<BR>
will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2001
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with its first national conference!!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“FreeFenCon’’
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May 25-27, 2001
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyatt Regency Hotel,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downtown Columbus, OH
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MARCON 36,
<BR>
Ohio’s oldest and largest science fiction, fantasy, media and science
<BR>
convention, will host the LFS’s first conference.
<BR>
<P>* MARCON, which annually attracts between 2,000 and 3,000 people from 25
<BR>
states,  offers a 125-table dealer’s room, a large art show/auction, a fun
<BR>
masquerade/dance (usually DJ'ed by California's Dr. Demento), six
<BR>
simultaneous program tracks of panel discussions, writer’s workshops, gaming
<BR>
rooms, and video screenings (including libertarian sf films) ; children’s
<BR>
programming and a 24-hour con suite with free refreshments.
<BR>
<P>* The LFS will present its Prometheus Hall of Fame awards to classic
<BR>
libertarian fiction during Marcon’s Saturday night masquerade!  (Our 2001
<BR>
Prometheus Award for Best Book will continue to be presented, as it usually
<BR>
is, at the 2001 Worldcon, which will take place over Labor Day weekend in
<BR>
Philadelphia.)
<BR>
<P>* JAMES HOGAN (“Voyage From Yesteryear,’’ “The Multiplex Man’’) will be
<BR>
Marcon’s “Prometheus Awards Guest of Honor.”
<BR>
<P>* Marcon also is inviting Grand Master POUL ANDERSON (“No Truce With Kings,
<BR>
“Trader to the Stars,’’ “Operation Chaos.’’)
<BR>
<P>* The LFS also hopes to invite other Prometheus Awardwinners to be LFS Guests
<BR>
of Honor.  Who would you like us to invite?  Please let us know!  Our
<BR>
conference budget is limited, but we are asking LFS members who register to
<BR>
earmark a separate check for a Speakers Travel Fund, so we can help pay for
<BR>
at least a substantial part of the airfare for our most important guests of
<BR>
honor.
<BR>
<P>* Prometheus winner  Brad Linaweaver (“Sliders,’’ “Moon of Ice’’), who is an
<BR>
enthusiastic supporter of the LFS meeting at Marcon, already has confirmed
<BR>
that he will attend, because Brad is part of the LFS convention organizing
<BR>
committee, which also includes all four LFS Advisory members in Ohio:
<BR>
Michael Grossberg, Matt Gaylor, Joseph Martino and Jeff Wolfe.)
<BR>
<P>* Other confirmed LFS guests and Marcon panelists: LFS Director Victoria
<BR>
Varga, LFS founder and newspaper journalist Michael Grossberg, libertarian
<BR>
author/sf writer Joseph Martino (“Science Funding: Politics &amp; Porkbarrel’’) &amp;
<BR>
sf author Steve Burgauer (“The Grandfather Paradox’’).
<BR>
<P>* MARCON also will host a dozen other guests, including author Robert Jordan,
<BR>
artist Ellisa Mitchell, and major sf editors, comix artists, gamers, TV
<BR>
actors, scientists.
<BR>
<P>* If you would like to be a Marcon panelist, let us know.  Just send your bio
<BR>
and what types of panel subjects you'd enjoy talking about, to Michael
<BR>
Grossberg (<A HREF="mailto:mikegrossb@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Best%20Libertarian%20Science%20Fiction:%20Prometheus%20Awards/Hall%20of%20Fame%20Finalists%20Announced!&In-Reply-To=&lt;v04220805b56fb717edb0@[198.4.94.228]&gt;">mikegrossb@aol.com</A>).  Marcon's program director is very receptive
<BR>
to including at least one or two dozen LFS members (not just sf authors, but
<BR>
libertarian activists, journalists, editors, booksellers, publishers,
<BR>
artists, and issue experts) on as many of their 50-60 panel discussions as
<BR>
possible.
<BR>
<P>* Marcon is arranging special discount rates for the Hyatt Regency hotel and
<BR>
other nearby hotels (Red Roof Inn, Holiday Inn Crown Plaza, Courtyard by
<BR>
Marriott, etc.) We will provide this information in future updates.
<BR>
<P>* Columbus, Ohio, pretty centrally located within LFS' farflung national
<BR>
membership, is rather inexpensive to fly to, since it's a very competitive
<BR>
air market, with no major airline dominating the city as a hub.  Among the
<BR>
more competitive airlines: USAir, Delta, America West, Southwest Airlines,
<BR>
United, TWA.
<BR>
<P><P>* Advance registration: Only $35 before Dec. 31, 2000. (That includes a $25
<BR>
check made out to Marcon and a $10 check made out to the LFS, for our
<BR>
speakers' travel fund.  Additional donations are welcome.) Send checks to
<BR>
LFS, c/o Michael Grossberg, 3164 Plymouth Place, Columbus, OH 43213.
