<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; You haven't explained how my goals are acheived with your system.  You
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; merely relabelled your system to use the terms that I use.  (Freedom is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; slavery!)  My goals are still incompatible with your system.  If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; redefine the terms, I will just have to restate my goals using different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; terms again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True.  As I have suggested in a variety of disclaimers, if you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; committed to this goal intrinsically, then there's no convincing you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, I'd expected that you DIDN'T hold this goal intrinsically, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only extrinsically, that is, you hold it in light of some other beliefs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you have, so if those beliefs turned out to be false, you'd drop the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goal.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the problem that this discussion usually degrades into.  You don't
<BR>
really believe that deep down I believe what I say I do.  You are therefore
<BR>
not debating with me, but with a strawman viewpoint that you think will make
<BR>
your point better.  However, when I read your point, it doesn't directly
<BR>
apply to my discussion, and we end up talking past each other.  (It has been
<BR>
interesting and thought-provocing anyway!)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, taking a cue from John Clark, just how upset would you be if you found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out that your consciousness stream had already been stunted?  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular, suppose I told you that in the middle of the night last night,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone replaced your regular brand Newstrom with a copy brewed from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Harvey freeze-dried crystals.  (By assumption, if nobody told you that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this had gone on, you'd never know.)
</EM><BR>
<P>You should be able to predict my answers, but you won't like them.  I can
<BR>
only answer from my belief system, not yours.
<BR>
<P>1.  The old Harvey Newstrom would object, if he were still alive.  He would
<BR>
have object right up to the point of death (or &quot;stunting&quot;) if he is no
<BR>
longer alive.
<BR>
<P>2.  The new Harvey Newstrom would be glad to be alive.  He would feel sorry
<BR>
that the old Harvey Newstrom was murdered.  He would hope that a similar
<BR>
fate doesn't befall him.
<BR>
<P>3.  The fact that I can't prove a crime happened doesn't mean it never
<BR>
happened or it wasn't a crime.  Even if I can't prove that I am the
<BR>
original, I still believe that all copies should live.  Thus, it doesn't
<BR>
matter if I am the original or a copy, my viewpoint is the same:  Don't kill
<BR>
this instance of me, it wants to live forever.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As you can guess, I wouldn't mind this a bit if it happened to me.  And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while I think most of us would certainly find this state to be a little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; odd, it seems to me that, if this goal is all that important to you, you'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably be pretty upset to find out that this had happened.  Would you?
</EM><BR>
<P>In my view, the two copies (original and replacement) are separate
<BR>
individuals.  The new copy would not feel murdered just because you killed
<BR>
the old copy.  They are separate people.  The new copy might even be glad
<BR>
that it was that &quot;other guy&quot; who got killed instead of himself.
