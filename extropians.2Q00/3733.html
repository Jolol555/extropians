<P>
I think we as transhumanists are a bit in a dilemma here. 
<BR>
<P>On one hand we are pro medical freedom, since we want access to
<BR>
treatments for e.g. life extension, cognitive enhancement and physical
<BR>
improvements. We are also opposed to straightjacking the definition of
<BR>
health and disease since that could easily lead to a situation where
<BR>
only one or a few forms of bodily plans are acceptable; in order to
<BR>
safeguard our morphological freedom we need to give others their
<BR>
freedom too.
<BR>
<P>But on the other hand we are pro rationality and in general opposed to
<BR>
superstition and pseudoscience. While we might let people do whatever
<BR>
they want with their lives and money, we should not let disinformation
<BR>
spread unchecked. If people cannot distinguish the real remedies and
<BR>
improvements from the fakes, then money will be invested in the wrong
<BR>
products, the scientifically proven treatments we seek will be
<BR>
expensive since they are selected by few and worse, they will often be
<BR>
mistaken for fakes and hence give transhumanism a bad name (&quot;Oh,
<BR>
you're just a new age cult that likes to call itself scientific, you
<BR>
still take the same snake-oil!&quot;). 
<BR>
<P>Our situation is that by supporting medical freedom, we also place
<BR>
ourselves in the same camp as a lot of groups we normally would want
<BR>
to separate ourselves from - new agers, some luddites and a lot of
<BR>
pseudoscience. Politics does make strange bedfellows. 
<BR>
<P>Can we promote some ideas that support freedom and rationality? I
<BR>
think so. One obvious would be to try to set up various forms of
<BR>
independent consumer reviews and medical information sources, so that
<BR>
people can access high-quality information about medical
<BR>
treatments. Instead relying on having the government blocking access
<BR>
to bad treatments, a reviewing system might be more flexible: review
<BR>
organisations (which need to maintain their good reputations) can
<BR>
review drugs and if they meet their standards the drug can be sold
<BR>
with their seal of approval; different health organisations can then
<BR>
announce what review levels (and from who) they accept, in turn a step
<BR>
towards good consumer information (this is just the same idea as the
<BR>
independent review boards for scientific web publication I have
<BR>
mentioned a few times on the list). 
<BR>
<P>But no amount of organisation can help if people in general do not
<BR>
think critically about their medical treatments. Hence it is clear
<BR>
that to really get a free medical system to work with as few memetic
<BR>
parasites as possible, education and stimulation to critical thinking
<BR>
and self-development is necessary. It is not an either-or question,
<BR>
even a few sceptics can do a lot of good by exposing snake-oil, but
<BR>
the more people that employ critical thinking the better. Weird and
<BR>
often erroneous alternatives will be explored, but that is much better
<BR>
than enforced conformity.
