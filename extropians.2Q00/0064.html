<EM>&gt; &gt; Hardly. You are falsely assuming that *everyone* will willingly wear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; these nannybots, especially criminals or former criminals, or those with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; criminal intent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I record all my own activities, then I have hard evidence that I can use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anytime I choose.  If I am accused of a crime, I have records to prove that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was at home sleeping.  And if I get attacked, then I have evidence I can use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against my attacker.  So it doesn't matter if the criminal types wear one at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all.
</EM><BR>
<P>And If I am your attacker, all I need is Mike's handy cam zapper to fry
<BR>
your electronics. Now you have no record, evidence, whatever. If your
<BR>
body cam is not automatically transmitting your video to a storage
<BR>
device elsewhere (by a method I cannot interfere with using easy to
<BR>
build devices made from radio shack components), then all I need to do
<BR>
is take your bodycam/computer, smash it to itty bitty smithereens, and
<BR>
melt them down to slag. No more evidence. If there is no overall total
<BR>
surveillance system in the area that I am attacking you, and there are
<BR>
no other people present, then there is absolutely no record of the
<BR>
attack, you are dead, and your happy happy joy joy, good good feelings
<BR>
world has come to an end, and proved worthless in protecting you.
<BR>
<P>if I can think of these ways around your bodycam 'security' system, then
<BR>
there will be millions of criminals around the world who can also think
<BR>
of these things.
<BR>
<P>This is why I state that such technology is USELESS without an overall
<BR>
total surveillance system that covers the entire surface of the earth.
<BR>
Without a Big Brother syste, the alleged increase in crime fighting that
<BR>
surveillance provides is ephemeral, or easily countered.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You run into the same conundrum of the gun control people (which is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; surprising, since you seem to have the same mental failings with regard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to that issue as well) who falsely assume that those who are criminals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or who have criminal intent will obey all gun control laws.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you really think gun control advocates believe that?
</EM><BR>
<P>Why else would they advocate the passage of laws that merely limit the
<BR>
rights of law abiding citizens when there are already over 20,000 gun
<BR>
control laws on the books that they don't enforce as it is?? The boys at
<BR>
Columbine broke 18 or 19 laws when they did what they did. What makes
<BR>
you think that a 20th or 21st would have kept them from doing what they
<BR>
wanted to do? Outlaws are outlaws, by definition, because they have a
<BR>
total disregard for the law. Making more laws for them to disregard is
<BR>
not going to keep them from breaking the ones they already broke.
<BR>
<P>What LaPierre of the NRA said about Clinton's need for some amount of
<BR>
violence to further his agenda was rude, crude, but totally correct and
<BR>
on target. If gun controllers really wanted to eliminate gun related
<BR>
violence, they would focus on making sure that law enforcment and
<BR>
prosecutors convicted every single weapons violator they caught.
<BR>
Instead, weapons charges are, in the overwhelming number of cases, the
<BR>
first charge that gets tossed when the plea bargaining starts.
<BR>
<P>Considering that people like Sarah Brady (who was a closet socialist up
<BR>
until the last ten years) have been caught in the last few years openly
<BR>
stating that their goal is the total elimination of all guns to make the
<BR>
imposition of socialist world government easier (and which is supported
<BR>
by the existence of the current UN Campaign Against Small Arms, which
<BR>
seeks to eliminate the private ownership of all small arms in the world,
<BR>
including here in the US), and other renowned anti-gunners like Ted
<BR>
Turner regularly communicate with and consort with people like Fidel
<BR>
Castro, its becoming pretty clear that the whole purpose of the gun
<BR>
control movement, coupled with the lax enforcement of gun laws is a low
<BR>
level application of the classic ChiCom strategies for generating
<BR>
vicious cycles of violence and opression, leading up to the populace
<BR>
begging to have its civil rights confiscated by a totalitarian group.
<BR>
<P>As for ubiquitous surveillance, the major media has not started to
<BR>
trumpet that yet, because it still needs to wait for the NEA to get the
<BR>
literacy level down low enough that only a minority of the population
<BR>
can still understand the warnings of people like Orwell, and most of the
<BR>
literate people will be the nomenklatura/intelligentsia anyways, and
<BR>
will be for it. Once they get on the band wagon though, don't expect
<BR>
open mutual systems like what Zero describes, because the feds will make
<BR>
sure that there is plenty of publicity for cases where perpetrators
<BR>
corrupted their victims surveillance systems and turn it against them,
<BR>
so the feds can demonstrate that 'civilians' are not responsibly enough
<BR>
to handle the system, that big government needs to take control of the
<BR>
sytem...
