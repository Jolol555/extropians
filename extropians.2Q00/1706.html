The limits on cryonic storage are much less than those discussed
<BR>
(quoted below).  Robert Freitas has done a paper on this and
<BR>
the draft version placed limits of 500-1000 years cryonic
<BR>
suspension before endoradiation would become a significant
<BR>
factor.  Currently the paper is being reworked to take into
<BR>
account radiation from the carbon in the histones, so those
<BR>
limits may be revised downward.  Counter to that is the
<BR>
possibility of syn-genome replacement based on the methods
<BR>
of genome fragment reassembly (pioneered by TIGR).
<BR>
<P>As I've stated before, and I'll state again, the limits on
<BR>
cryonic reanimation would appear to be fundamentally based
<BR>
on the question of whether or not the freezing process causes
<BR>
loss of positional information that could prevent 3D-reassembly.
<BR>
Given the size of synaptic and cellular structures, I strongly
<BR>
doubt that to be the case.  These are hundreds of thousands to
<BR>
tens-of-millions of atoms in size.  They are only going to match
<BR>
up in unique places.  Only if you unfreeze the brain and let it
<BR>
decay away into a molecular soup have you lost that information.
