<EM>&gt; Actually, if there were 13 months of 28 days each,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that makes 364 days a year. It would take almost a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; century for your birthday to change seasons. Isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that close enough? And the 13th month could be named
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Smithember&quot;, because I thought of it! Yeah! And all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you people who were born on the 29th, 30th, or 31st
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would just be out of luck, no birthdays for you...
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, M. E. Smith is not the first to come up with this Calendar.  I
<BR>
first read about it when I was in grade school and, if my memory's correct,
<BR>
it was proposed as early as the 1930s.  I'm too tired right now to search
<BR>
for the first person to come up with this idea.  (This is not to knock
<BR>
Smith.  That he came upon it independently -- if s/he did -- is
<BR>
commendable.)
<BR>
<P>Another thing is that changing calendars no longer has the same flair it did
<BR>
hundreds of years ago.  Witness, e.g., how the Revolutionaries in France
<BR>
failed to get that nation to stick with a new calendar.
