<P>Yes, but since you're not telling us enough to judge what's being said by
<BR>
Cramer, this is perilously close to argument from authority.
<BR>
<P>The rough sense I get of the process can be modeled like this (forgive me
<BR>
if I'm way wrong):
<BR>
<P>You have a one-tonne ingot of steel down the back of the starship in
<BR>
freefall, aimed up an electromagnetic launcher. You turn on your power
<BR>
source and the coils click into brief action one after another, dragging
<BR>
the ingot ever faster toward the prow. 
<BR>
<P>When it gets to the nose of the ship, the lump is moving at 0.9999 c, say,
<BR>
and masses 2.2 million megatonnes. It hits the plate at the end of the ship
<BR>
and recoils, shoving the ship the hell forward (but the ship has meanwhile
<BR>
been flying backward, hasn't it, impelled by this internal mass driver
<BR>
effect?), and as it recoils down the launcher its energy and momentum are
<BR>
sucked back into the ship, pushing it the other way, balancing the books.
<BR>
Except that by the time it's slowed completely and reached the aft storage
<BR>
container, it's back to massing a single tonne. So the books are *not*
<BR>
balanced, there's been a net impulse forward when the ingot was *really
<BR>
really heavy*, its m having been pumped up by all that injected e from the
<BR>
batteries. 
<BR>
<P>This doesn't make a *hell* of a lot of sense to me, but is that something
<BR>
like your story?
<BR>
<P>(Bearing in mind that there's no striker plate, because your asymmetrical
<BR>
mass is actually rotating, all working parts being made from some
<BR>
supernatural material, and that it isn't zillions of klicks long, and all
<BR>
that pesky detail stuff...)
