&nbsp;I think it's a screwy idea. It would never work against a massive attack
<BR>
&nbsp;because defense will always be more expensive than offence, if it takes 10 
<BR>
&nbsp;dollars to shoot down 10 cents of hardware the other side will just overwhelm
<BR>
&nbsp;you. As for a small attack, well if I were an insane dictator of some little
<BR>
&nbsp;jerkwater country I wouldn't use ICBM's to deliver my bombs, they're harder to
<BR>
&nbsp;make than nukes and much more expensive; I'd use FedEx or UPS to deliver my
<BR>
&nbsp;H Bomb, the transportation would only cost a few dollars not a few billion.
<BR>
&nbsp;It has other advantages too, a rocket can be tracked so everyone would know
<BR>
&nbsp;who was responsible for having Manhattan vaporized, America might be 
<BR>
&nbsp;irritated at me. Better if things just go boom and nobody knows why.
<BR>
&nbsp;I could even send a letter of condolence afterwards.
<BR>
<EM>  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
All of the above is good sense. The present plan is to stop a small attack or 
<BR>
protect a given area. The sea based system is the one being pushed forward at 
<BR>
the moment. There is no attempt underway to do a full blown SDI multiple 
<BR>
layered defense. ( Be nice guys, my ships will be the launch platforms for 
<BR>
these.)

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I thought the conspiracy was to get the military to pay for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;permanent manned presence in space.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it was to pay for the development of a SSTO (single stage to orbit)
<BR>
spaceplane 
<BR>
for the USAF, successfully completed in the late 80s according to Aviation Leak.
<BR>
<P>- as well as to bankrupt the USSR.
<BR>
<P>Rob
<BR>
<P>what, me theorise?
<BR>
<P>-------------
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;But is it worth abrogating an arms-control treaty, pissing of the
<BR>
&nbsp;Russians and Chinese and re-starting the COld War for?
<BR>
<EM>  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
That treaty allows defense of two cities as the Russians have done. That 
<BR>
treaty was with the USSR and while the Russians may like to think so, They 
<BR>
Ain't the CCCP. The Chinese are very much a part of the problem and a limited 
<BR>
defense would spike their wheels for decades.
<BR>
A Cold War with whom? The Russians? The Chinese? Who has the money and isn't 
<BR>
spending it already? Cold War indeed! 
<BR>
<P>See this is the proper debate; not is it possible.
<BR>
<P>Puca:)

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;That treaty allows defense of two cities as the Russians have done. That 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;treaty was with the USSR and while the Russians may like to think so, They 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ain't the CCCP.
</EM><BR>
<P>Erm, for the purposes of international law they are: after the
<BR>
break-up of the USSR, Russia accepted responsibility for the USSR's
<BR>
treaty obligations, and was recognised by the UN as the USSR's
<BR>
successor in matters such as the Security Council permanent seat.
<BR>
<P>Roy
<BR>
<P>--------------
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Yep.  The only people who have used this successfully against the late
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;unlamented Sovs are the Finns, who renounced the Treaty on Friendship
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;and Mutual Cooperation &lt;spit&gt; when the Communists fell from power.  Even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;they would probably have had to back down if Yeltsin had made an issue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;of it, but the Russians presumably decided that they would just as soon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;*not* have Finns with guns called up to defend Russia's western border
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;in a time of crisis, heh.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I hadn't realised they'd denounced that treaty.  Good for them!
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, in 1991 IIRC.  Esko Aho, in his best Finnish deadpan, announced
<BR>
that the YYA-sopimus had been signed with the USSR, which no longer
<BR>
existed, so the treaty was void.  It was very low key, and I'm sure they
<BR>
advised Yeltsin ahead of time that the announcement was coming.  The
<BR>
reasoning was illegitimate, as you noted earlier, but I think all
<BR>
parties concerned had already decided that the treaty was offensive and
<BR>
should be quietly nullified with all deliberate speed (the Russians
<BR>
hardly uttered a peep).  Soon afterward, a replacement treaty was signed
<BR>
that was peer-to-peer, similar to agreements Russia has with Germany.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now, next they need to get Karelia back...
</EM><BR>
<P>To tell the truth, nobody wants it back except a few revanchists.  Of
<BR>
course, if Russia would take back all the people Stalin &quot;resettled&quot;
<BR>
there it might be a different matter; but very few Finns would take
<BR>
eastern Karelia back even if it was offered to them free and clear, if
<BR>
absorbing the Russians who live there was part of the deal.  Petsamo
<BR>
might be a different matter, but presumably that's not in the cards.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Roy, a fennophile from an early age
</EM><BR>
<P>I have sometimes wondered about kalevala.org. :-)
