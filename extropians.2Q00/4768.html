<EM>&gt; &gt;A market can operate only in the absence of force. It works only because

all
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of the decisions made by the participants are voluntary, and each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;participant makes local trade-offs in the way that best suits his own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;desires. The moment you introduce actors that have the ability to compel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;others to do things at gunpoint, this is no longer the case. Instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;evolving in the direction of satisfying the desires of all participants,
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;system then evolves to satisfy the desires of those who have access to
</EM><BR>
force
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;at the expense of those who do not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the argument for antitrust legislation, and I absolutely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agree with you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then you're reading something I didn't write. Force means actual, naked,
<BR>
shoot-you-right-now-if-you-don't-obey violence. Corporations can't do that
<BR>
(at least, not in any country that has even a passable semblance of a free
<BR>
market). A company can cajole, bribe, and try to outsmart you, but
<BR>
ultimately all of its power is based on voluntary transactions. No matter
<BR>
how hard it tries, no matter how unsavory its tactics become, there is
<BR>
nothing a company can do that will make it immune to the discipline of the
<BR>
market. Therefore, there is no need for anti-trust intervention in a
<BR>
well-developed market - in the long run even the most powerful company can
<BR>
survive only by serving its customers.
<BR>
<P>Now, there are situations where the &quot;well-developed market&quot; criterion is not
<BR>
met. If you had some remote community with only one supplier for food, or
<BR>
water, or some other commodity that was necessary for survival, there might
<BR>
be a need to prevent them from abusing their power. However (and this a the
<BR>
point anti-trust regulators miss) such situations are inherently temporary -
<BR>
the mere existence of such a monopolist creates a financial opportunity that
<BR>
draws competitors, until eventually the monopoly ceases to exist. Laws to
<BR>
prevent monopolists from overcharging, or to break them up, are actually
<BR>
counterproductive because they subvert this process. All you really want to
<BR>
do is make sure no one starves before a competitor comes along.
