Teachers are hardly low paid. The median teacher salary for a job that only takes 3/4 of the year (and provides over a month of vacation during the school year), is above $30,000, for an annualized salary of $40,000.00. Not bad at all.

<P>That depends alot on where you are teaching!  In parts of the south and elsewhere, teachers are paid very little.  In Alaska, teachers are the second or third best paid in the nation.  We used to be number one.

I would not accept a plain old teacher for such an important job. Anyone who teaches such a course must

have training in constitutional law, be a veteran, etc.

<P>A 'plain old teacher' is not good enough?  I have had some wonderful 'plain old teachers' in my life who could have done a wonderful job teaching the course.
