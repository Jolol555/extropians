<P>
In today's LA Times there was an op ed piece by Craig Venter and Daniel
<BR>
Cohen about some of the issues relating to the genome work.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/news/comment/20000626/t000060554.html">http://www.latimes.com/news/comment/20000626/t000060554.html</A> (this link
<BR>
may not work after Monday).
<BR>
<P>I have to nitpick the beginning just because I thought it was funny:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the 20th century was the century of physics, the 21st century will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be the century of biology. While combustion, electricity and nuclear
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power defined scientific advances in the 20th century, the new biology
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of genome research, which has provided the complete genetic blueprint
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a species, including the human species, will define our century.
<BR>
<P>The funny part was the claim that the scientific advances in the 20th
<BR>
century could be defined by combustion, electricity and nuclear power.
<BR>
<P>Combustion?  How many people would list combustion as a major area of
<BR>
scientific advance in the 20th century?  I thought we had a pretty good
<BR>
handle on this ever since we gave up on phlogiston back in the 1700s.
<BR>
I'd guess this really refers to the engineering advances in combustion
<BR>
engines which have revolutionized transportation.
<BR>
<P>Electricity?  Again, the basic science was well established before
<BR>
the beginning of the century.  Electronics would have been a more
<BR>
appropriate term.  Perhaps the authors are talking about the engineering
<BR>
and industrial work to set up widespread electrical power distribution.
<BR>
<P>Nuclear power?  This is certainly a 20th century science, but usually
<BR>
&quot;nuclear power&quot; refers to electrical power generation.  Nuclear energy
<BR>
has played a significant role in generating electricity but has not been
<BR>
revolutionary in itself.  The real revolution is in nuclear weapons.
<BR>
They have utterly restructured the international balance of power and
<BR>
may have in fact done more than any other advance to enhance world peace.
<BR>
<P>After this rocky beginning, most of the article is fairly mundane.  However
<BR>
I was shocked by the following:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too Many Healthy: As always in science, positive advances can have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negative consequences elsewhere. The world now has 6 billion people. If
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we save millions more and their children through genomics, how will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the planet cope? In principle, responsible scientific advances that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prolong life must go forward only in tandem with efforts to ensure
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the biosphere's compatibility with more population.
<BR>
<P>This seems to imply that if you have a scientific advance to prolong
<BR>
life, but you don't have anything on hand to help the biosphere, it is
<BR>
irresponsible to exploit this advance??!!  Only a bankrupt moral system
<BR>
leads to the conclusion that it is irresponsible to save the lives
<BR>
of adults and children, IMO.  The authors do go on to point out that
<BR>
biotech will help with food production, so perhaps they don't really
<BR>
believe this claim but just set it up as a straw man so they could show
<BR>
that their technology meets even this challenge.
<BR>
<P>Another rather strange passage described the risks of abuse of this
<BR>
information:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to have a new human being? Once we know the full lay
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the genome map, we can, theoretically, design such a new human
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being. If enough money and research are put into human and bird genome
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research, we could no doubt put a bird's wings on a man.These are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not trivial issues. In a hundred years, all this will be possible. We
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to admit that it could happen. Historical experience has shown
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time and again that when something becomes possible sooner or later
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;someone does it. That is the risk.
<BR>
<P>Putting wings on a man is a rather curious image to raise.  Apparently the
<BR>
authors intend it to represent a risk of biotech, and in the context I
<BR>
believe they mean it to be a horrifying example of abuse.
<BR>
<P>The real issue here is the inability of the unconceived infant to
<BR>
consent to this or any other form of genetic engineering.  The wings
<BR>
would be purely decorative (a winged human could not fly, at least not
<BR>
on Earth) and probably very inconvenient in most circumstances.  So this
<BR>
is not an enhancement which I would endorse, at least not to a newly
<BR>
conceived infant.
<BR>
<P>If adults could modify some of their cells to sprout wings as a form
<BR>
of art or attire, it's hard to see why anyone other than die-hard
<BR>
conservatives would object strongly.  It's different only in degree
<BR>
from tattoos, piercings, and other body modifications which have been
<BR>
practiced by human cultures.  Science fiction readers are accustomed to
<BR>
depictions of healthy societies with far more drastic variations.
<BR>
<P>All in all a rather strange article, mundane in places with a few
<BR>
bizarre sections to keep us on our toes.  Perhaps the dual authorship
<BR>
is showing here.
<BR>
