I think that it is important to consider the different types of emotions and 
<BR>
to identify the emotions that are personally damaging - unnecessary anger, 
<BR>
overreacting to problems, a tendency to causes disarray to oneself and to 
<BR>
others; AND the emotions that are essential to our intelligence and our 
<BR>
enjoyment of life - being aware of oneself and one's environment, ability to 
<BR>
voice one's views, conscientiousness about other peoples feelings 
<BR>
(sympathy), full use of one's senses, and the most important, the emotional 
<BR>
intelligence to perceive the importance of a learning from mistakes but 
<BR>
having the knowledge (wisdom, as suggested by Nadia) of knowing when to turn 
<BR>
down the barometer of emotions and when to turn it up.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I read your post several times to really digest it.  You put forth a 
<BR>
powerful argument as to why emotions add to, and do not detract from, 
<BR>
intellectual and social development.  I hope you put this post in the next 
<BR>
edition of your book &quot;Create, Recreate.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Natasha, this may sound strange, but I could see you as an ordained minister 
<BR>
in a Unitarian church.  You can &quot;sermonize&quot; in the best sense of the word.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
