From: Charlie Stross &lt;<A HREF="mailto:charlie@antipope.org?Subject=Re:%20Northern%20Ireland&In-Reply-To=&lt;200004271517.IAA16786@well.com&gt;">charlie@antipope.org</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm not &quot;pretending&quot; anything; I'm just highly pissed off with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;common American reaction -- to blame one side for a civil war,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when both sides are pretty much evenly to blame (judging by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;number of murders).
</EM><BR>
<P>Lets skip this one for the moment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The hard men with the guns are all a bunch of bloodthirsty clowns,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and we'd all be better off without them. But arguing that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problem is &quot;British imperialism&quot; is to reduce it to an absurd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;proposition. Sure, the original invasion of Ireland in the 17th
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;century was reprehensible. Sure, the actions of the settlers'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;descendants since then were also bad. But pulling the British
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government out of the North right now isn't going to fix that;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's just going to make the UVF start on a rampage of ethnic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cleansing, and make the pIRA or the cIRA or whatever they call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;themselves this week retaliate in kind.
</EM><BR>
<P>We agree that this needs to end, we still seem to disagree on the
<BR>
methods.
<BR>
<P>The first step should be to remove all British troops. This will be
<BR>
unpopular for obvious reasons. I have written both the president
<BR>
and the U.N. secretary general and proposed this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There seems to be a cultural assumption ingrained in a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Americans that in any conflict, there must be a bunch of goodies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and a bunch of baddies, and all that is necessary is to identify
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the good guys and side with them. This is one struggle where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bad guys are distributed evenly on all sides -- if you want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;root for someone, root for the peace process and the politicians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sitting around the negotiating table and _talking_ to each other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about how to get _all_ the guns and bombs off the street. Those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guys understand that any peace settlement has to be multilateral;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even the British government has accepted that proposition (since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Margaret Thatcher was forced to quit).
</EM><BR>
<P>There are tens of millions of people of Irish decent here in
<BR>
America that maintain close ties with &quot;Home&quot;, in one of my favorite
<BR>
hangouts Gaelic is the majority tongue.
<BR>
<P>Clearly those wishing to retain British ties will require dual
<BR>
citizenship.
<BR>
<P>But anything other than a unified Ireland will be unacceptable to
<BR>
most everyone I know.

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Who is this &quot;you&quot; you're talking about, white man? I'm a Jewish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Brit of Polish descent who lives in Scotland and votes for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Scottish independence at every opportunity. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm Welsh, English, Scotish, Irish on my fathers side, and Polish
<BR>
on Moms. Our people came to America in 1642 (Georgia now).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And if you'd bothered reading up on the field you might have come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;across the interesting statistic that something like 85% of the GB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;population favours pulling the GB out of NI and letting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;buggers kill each other ... stereotyping people by attributing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;foreign policy of their government to them as personal opinion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;isn't exactly a good way of figuring out what's going on anywhere,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is it? Or would you like me to blame you for Janet Reno's actions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the grounds that, being American, you must logically support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;her?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's good to know 85% of the GB population agrees with me.
<BR>
<P>So I guess my comments should be amended to read &quot;British
<BR>
Government&quot; instead. Please consider them amended as such.
