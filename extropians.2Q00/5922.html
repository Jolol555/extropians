</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shows a bad long term trend.  I sure hope it has changed lately.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is a sobering figure.  War related deaths in the 20th century running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about 110 million, almost three times the per-capita figures of the 17th,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 18th, and 19th centuries.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The authors show a correlation between countries with high percentages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of young men and countries with a warlike record today.  This probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't work too well across the centuries, as I am assuming that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shorter lifespans of the past would have put more people in the young
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demographics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's not clear that it is causative either in today's world, as there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is are obvious geographic and cultural connections among the third
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world countries with many young people, beyond just their demographic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; similarities.  Uganda has more in common with Rwanda than with Sweden
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any way you look at it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The figures I found for warfare were about 50 million deaths (military and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; civilian) in WWII, and about 20 million for WWI.  This leaves 40 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unaccounted for in the chart.  If you include the Russian revolution and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Stalinist purges, that could account for the bulk of the remainder,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although the latter would probably not be considered war related.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is also the Chinese civil war, Vietnam, and the Vietnam-Cambodian
<BR>
invasion and civil war. Then there's the India-Pakistan wars (four or
<BR>
five of those), plus the Iran-Iraq war.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Libertarians tend to say, &quot;wars are caused by governments,&quot; and that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the end of the analysis.  This is too simplistic: governments have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around for a long time, but here we have a big increase in warfare in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the past 100 years.
</EM><BR>
<P>Government centralization, taxation for defense spending, and control
<BR>
over the economies of their countries peaked in the mid 20th century.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is perhaps encouraging that at least 70% of the deaths occured in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the first half of the century, despite the population being twice as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high in the 2nd half on average.  Perhaps that will turn out to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been the peak and now we are on a downslope towards historical levels.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you are right. The current technological trends speak to high
<BR>
technology being used to deliver guided munitions on surgical strikes
<BR>
that are ever more accurate. The old days of carpet bombing, gassing,
<BR>
trench warfare and incindiary bombing I think are over. Large amounts of
<BR>
money are still being spent, though to a lesser extent, about 50% of the
<BR>
level seen in the early 1980's, but this money is being spent for
<BR>
technology capable of acheiving tactical objectives that are more and
<BR>
more removed from any impact upon the man in the field or the civilian
<BR>
population. Current weapons technology is focused toward destroying the
<BR>
warmaking capability and industrial infrastructure of the enemy with as
<BR>
few casualties as possible. Professional armies are shrinking to a small
<BR>
core cadre of well trained and equipped professionals, which appears to
<BR>
mimic the trend in the 16th and 17th centuries, before
<BR>
industrialization, toward mercenaries and condotierre captains, who
<BR>
fight set piece wars with limited objectives for a world aristocracy who
<BR>
played politics like a chessboard and treated the commoner as a mere
<BR>
thing to be disposed of at a whim.
<BR>
<P>I think the next century will see a bit of a melding of this with the
<BR>
mass mentality of the 20th century, where governments, that are the
<BR>
tools of syndicates of metanational industrial groups, will become
<BR>
mercenary services that will go into a geographic area that is resisting
<BR>
the authority of either the government or the metanats, and
<BR>
systematically disarm and de-industrialize that area, forcing the
<BR>
population to subjugate itself to the offense's markets (See &quot;The
<BR>
Merchant's War&quot;, I beleive by Forward)
