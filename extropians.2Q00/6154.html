<P><EM>&gt; I never read &quot;Coming of Age in Somoa.&quot;  I heard that everything in it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  questionable, since when the Somoan girls were being interviewed, they made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  up a bunch of stuff as a joke (but they didn't let Meade in on the joke).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I was categorizing more along the lines used by Jared Diamond in...what was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that book called?..._Guns, Germs, and Steel_ or something like that...with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  tribal cultures defined as those in which leaders are chosen for specific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  purposes and continue to lead only so long as the people agree to have them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  lead; in such cases the leaders are unlikely to enjoy special material
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  advantages. The definition refers to political powers and says nothing 
</EM><BR>
about
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  the level of violence practiced by individual people in the course of day 
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  day life, although in kinship based tribes violence is more likely to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  turned against non-members than members. This is in contrast to, say, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  chiefdom or a kingdom, where the leader continues to lead even when a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  substantial number of members of the group are against his or her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  leadership; in chiefdoms, the leader enjoys material advantages such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  fancier clothing, nicer housing, special foods.
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't read Diamond's book -- it's gotten strong pro and con reviews from 
<BR>
people I respect, which means I ought to read it, I suppose.  Put another 
<BR>
round in the clip!
<BR>
<P>On the face of your desciption of his definition of &quot;tribal&quot; leadership, I 
<BR>
have some fairly deep doubts about it's empirical validity.  More comment 
<BR>
from me will have to await my reading of his book.
