This is another repost from Cryonet to let you all know about the plans 
<BR>
being formed to create a cryonics community around a resort.  David Pizer is 
<BR>
asking for ideas on what should be included in the project.  Any ideas? 
<BR>
Email the man and let him know.  He paints a beautiful word picture of the 
<BR>
place.  He must have worked in advertising at one time! lol
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,

<EM>&gt;Subject: Cryonics Community, Publications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's encouraging that Dave Pizer has now acquired land for a possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cryonics community.......
</EM><BR>
<P>snip
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I do hope we can get a cryonics community started, and especially in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beautiful setting like this is supposed to be. (I haven't seen it yet but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intend to soon.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Notice to all in the area:  Mike and I will be at the site on Saturday, 
<BR>
April 15th.  Any cryonicist who would like a tour of the property is welcome 
<BR>
to come by. As far as a &quot;beautiful setting&quot; Mike mentioned, imagine a place: 
<BR>
The land is a gentle land of four full seasons. Cool summer breeze, Windows 
<BR>
left open at evening: Fall asleep to the burbling harmony of the creek 
<BR>
Nights so clear.  I had forgot how many stars are visible when the air is so 
<BR>
clean and crisp.
<BR>
<P>At night it is like being in 1950 again. Quiet winter nights
<BR>
Wake up on a fresh winter morning with 2 inches of virgin white snow, with 
<BR>
lush desert plants peaking through. But not very cold, you can go outside 
<BR>
without a jacket. The brilliant hue of fall colors along the large native 
<BR>
trees on the creek bank Rusty colored ducks overhead flying south, with 
<BR>
white necks and handsome squared heads.  They drop to a large, rock circled 
<BR>
pool in the brook for a drink before the continue of Rebirth of spring, 
<BR>
renewing the cycle of life with brilliant wildflowers.
<BR>
<P>Savor their sweet scent on a cool morning breeze. Reminding us of a 
<BR>
possible, beautiful similar experience awaiting us when we awaken out of 
<BR>
those cold, hard dewars. And all this just an hour's drive from Phoeinx with 
<BR>
all the things a large city has to offer.  This property's border touches 
<BR>
the highway so access is easy, safe and fast.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I hope also and expect that, if things do get going we will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;focus significant energies on dealing with last-minute and other difficult
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cryonics cases.
</EM><BR>
<P>With research taking so long, this is the single most important thing that 
<BR>
we all can do *now* that will improve the quality of suspensions most people 
<BR>
will get.  We will have a place to come together, share ideas, brainstorm, 
<BR>
and work together to change how people can get help. We work to change laws, 
<BR>
change the way the medical community sees cryonics, and change the minds of 
<BR>
the rest of the world.  Well, to some small degree, at least at first.

<P>snip
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;On the other side, I see many cryonicist interested in other advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;technical areas, such astronomy, space and rocket, electronics and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;computing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;to name some of them. Why not then create some techno-center where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;interested amateurs would find a technical support for their hobby?
</EM><BR>
<P>What are the things you want?  Be specific! Now is the time to post a list 
<BR>
of what you would like to see avaiable at this facility while we are in the 
<BR>
planning stages. Post your wish list.  We want your input because we know 
<BR>
the more we can make this attractive to a larger group of cryonicists, the 
<BR>
greater the chances for its success.  Send you suggestions let your 
<BR>
imangination loose.
<BR>
<P>Dave
