Yes'n'no. You can drive a vehicle in any damn state you want, without
<BR>
insurance ... if it's on private land. If you want to go on the public
<BR>
highways, however, it has to be insured, pay road tax (which notionally
<BR>
goes into a fund for maintaining the highways), and have a Ministry of
<BR>
Transport test certificate indicating that it passed inspection. 
<BR>
<P>The goal of the MoT inspection is not, as is the case in Japan, to ensure
<BR>
that the vehicle matches the manufacturer's spec, but to ensure that the
<BR>
vehicle is *safe*.  This isn't simply for the owner, but for other road
<BR>
users. Consider this a public good; do you really want to share the road
<BR>
with vehicles with lousy brakes, non-operational lights, bald tyres,
<BR>
and defective bodywork that might drop off? (One would suspect that in
<BR>
any libertarian state with private roads, the road-owners would end up
<BR>
imposing similar conditions on people using them -- or higher tolls.)
