I don't want some Harvey Newstromish person to exist in the future. I want

*this* current Harvey Newstrom to continue to exist and evolve into the 
<BR>
future
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I share that sentiment!
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
My goal is for my consciousness to continue to grow so that the future 
<BR>
consciousness is more advanced than the past one. Killing it certainly won't 
<BR>
achieve that growth.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>That is also my goal.  But keep in mind what people say about a person/mind 
<BR>
changing to the point over the years that the person you were in a prior 
<BR>
stage/age is in many ways &quot;dead.&quot;  And that is with a uninterrupted 
<BR>
continuation of consciousness!
<BR>
<P>I would certainly not want to upload (except in the most dire of 
<BR>
circumstances) if it resulted in the death of my original organic brain.  
<BR>
Perhaps we have all seen _Lawnmower Man_ too many times! lol
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
If my one consciousness grows from then to now, there is no doubt that this 
<BR>
is an advanced version of me. If the previous consciousness is destroyed and 
<BR>
a later advanced consciousness appears, what is the connection between them?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>If it were an upload that captured 100% of your memories, personality and 
<BR>
intellect, then the connection between the original and the copy would be 
<BR>
100%.  Of course, the new environments and experiences that your copy would 
<BR>
encounter could create divergence from the original.  But you could 
<BR>
practically say the same for yourself now as compared to the &quot;you&quot; of ten or 
<BR>
twenty years ago.  You might disagree with this, but many people would look 
<BR>
back on their lives and agree.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
If all my thoughts are copied, does that make the new being &quot;me&quot;? What about 
<BR>
90% of my thoughts. What about creating a super-advanced being and just 
<BR>
assuming that I would have evolved into it? What if the new being is just 
<BR>
another person on this list who memorized my posts and starts acting so much 
<BR>
like me that nobody knows I'm gone? Where do we draw the line?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>If the uploading is not 100%, then the copy would obviously be less then 
<BR>
perfect.  Using an uploaded copy as a foundation for a super-advanced being 
<BR>
would be an interesting experiment, but again that is getting away from the 
<BR>
original.  And I would worry that something could go horribly wrong.  I 
<BR>
would want a full understanding of the uploaded person's psyche before going 
<BR>
ahead and using them as a template for a power.  A turing machine programmed 
<BR>
to sound like you, is obviously not you.
<BR>
<P>Where do we draw the line?  I suppose at a copy that is anything less then 
<BR>
100%, if that is ever technically possible.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
I don't want to be out of the show. All of life is a stage, and I'm one of 
<BR>
the actors. I don't want to be thrown off the set only to have another actor 
<BR>
take my role. I want to keep my role.-
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>The question is, will science one day be so advanced that they can upload my 
<BR>
&quot;full essence&quot; into a machine or a new organic brain?  We don't want copies, 
<BR>
we want ourselves.  And we don't want to chance getting a copy(while we are 
<BR>
dead) that actually thinks it's us!  I envision some sort of super-advanced 
<BR>
_Star Trek_ style &quot;transporter beam&quot; that transfers me into the new form, 
<BR>
and can even return me to my old one, and without any loss of information, 
<BR>
energy or matter.  Will that ever be possible?
<BR>
<P>Harvey, I completely understand where you are coming from.  I view a copy as 
<BR>
a COPY, and even if ABSOLUTELY like me, it is not &quot;ME.&quot;  It is instead a 
<BR>
totally identical twin.  This is for me so simple to understand.  It will 
<BR>
start off totally like me, but in time diverge and develop it's own 
<BR>
identity, to at least an extent.
<BR>
<P>And any perfect(or simply self-aware) copy (flesh or virtual) of me deserves 
<BR>
the full legal rights that I myself have.  And does not deserve to be a 
<BR>
plaything to be tortured or manipulated.  Again, this is so simple to 
<BR>
understand.

If your recollected experiences can be separated (or copied) from the 
<BR>
patterns in your brain, and the patterns in your brain can be separated (or 
<BR>
copied) from the brain itself, which (if any) of these three things would 
<BR>
you consider to be &quot;you&quot;? I believe that your answer to this question will 
<BR>
tell you what it is about you that you most want to preserve.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>If a 100% accurate upload can be achieved, then it would prove that copies 
<BR>
could be made that are as much &quot;me&quot; as I am.  But still, they are a separate 
<BR>
individual(non-lethal uploading here) and not the original.  They are as I 
<BR>
said before, an identical twin in ALL respects.
<BR>
<P>I think we need to look upon our uploads(copies) as being somewhat similar 
<BR>
to having children(starting out as adults, usually at least).  In a sense 
<BR>
this is the &quot;perfect child&quot; for the person who wants their descendant to be 
<BR>
just like them! lol  An uploaded copy or organic clone(with downloaded 
<BR>
memories) could truly be called a &quot;mind child.&quot;  And even this &quot;child&quot; would 
<BR>
in time probably change from the original and go it's own way.
<BR>
<P>Just a present-day studies with twins are so fascinating, I see the future 
<BR>
studies of originals and copies as being an enthralling subject matter.  
<BR>
Whether the original is dead and there is only one copy that tries to take 
<BR>
their place, or where the original is alive and has multiple copies.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes for all the mind children of tomorrow,
