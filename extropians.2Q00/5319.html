<EM>&gt;Subject: Re: what if microsoft disobeyed the breakup?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Date: Thu, 08 Jun 2000 07:39:36 +0200 As I pointed out,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anarcho-capitalism works _less_ well outside an anacho-capitalistic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;society. And I cannot se any such around anywhere at the moment. So...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So how to create an anarcho-capitalistic society?  Suggestions, please.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the usual agorist approach has been to say that virtually all evil 
<BR>
resides in the state and since it is also totally irrational, then it 
<BR>
naturally has to fall to pieces the day before yesterday...  So, as you can 
<BR>
see, logic dictates that we must already be there... ;)
<BR>
<P>A lot of people in the radical libertarian movement essentially lived their 
<BR>
lives on the above premises for a LONG time.  Surprise!  The state is still 
<BR>
here and prospering.
<BR>
<P>As Spencer MacCallum discusses in his seminal &quot;The Art of Community,&quot; the 
<BR>
state arose because we lacked the conceptual technology to do better.  When 
<BR>
the irrigation in the Tigris/Euphrates valley started seriously impinging 
<BR>
upon the cities downstream, there was no technology of property and title 
<BR>
and conflict resolution between sovereigns.  Those people followed formulas 
<BR>
- just as Stephenon described in &quot;Snow Crash.&quot;  When reality exceeded the 
<BR>
scope of the formulas, you did the best you could.  So we ended up with the 
<BR>
Sumerian Empire and the Code of Hammurabi.
<BR>
<P>Now we have a LOT better social/economic technology.  Now we can retrofit 
<BR>
that technology and innovate new solutions - such as a universal social 
<BR>
contract - that will outclass the primitive might-makes-right state and 
<BR>
ultimately defeat it.
<BR>
