<P>
Interestingly, what is being pointed out as the largest hole in my argument
<BR>
for the economic desirability of welfare, is my premise that a next
<BR>
generation is necessary, or at least desirable. With that premise removed, I
<BR>
indeed have no case.
<BR>
<P>I'll paraphrase the arguments received so far, and in doing so destroy
<BR>
subtle points raised by others and demonstrate my lack of understanding.
<BR>
<P>--------
<BR>
<P>Mike seems to be supporting me (?) below by pointing out that the middle and
<BR>
upper classes aren't interested in reproducing, but also makes his initial
<BR>
argument that DINKS can make it on their own, they don't need no stinking
<BR>
kids.
<BR>
<P>Brian Williams says that if you commit crime then you go to jail (always),
<BR>
and so the cost of crime cannot be compared to welfare. However, then you
<BR>
effectively have welfare, just with more unpleasant side effects for all
<BR>
involved, and higher costs (see Mike's post below). He also says we don't
<BR>
need to seperate &quot;true&quot; welfare cases from &quot;faking&quot; welfare cases; just
<BR>
leave 'em all out in the cold. Most interestingly, he points out that I have
<BR>
not supported my claim that children provide any benefit to anyone except
<BR>
their parents (and perhaps to themselves).
<BR>
<P>Billy Brown says that you can in fact seperate true charity cases from
<BR>
pretend ones (presumably with some kind of Slacker-O-Scope).
<BR>
<P>----------
<BR>
<P>I don't believe that you can effectively seperate slackers from the unfit by
<BR>
any means other than removing the safety net, and seeing who starves (those
<BR>
were the unfit). This is the same basic method used to detect witches: Throw
<BR>
the defendant in the lake, bound hand and foot; if he/she floats (ie:
<BR>
survives), he/she is a witch. Humanitarian concerns aside (I hope to leave
<BR>
such concerns out of this argument entirely), you run the risk of uprising
<BR>
by the disenfranchised. But then, perhaps the slackers have joined the army,
<BR>
and the disenfranchised are after all the unfit, so there's no real problem.
<BR>
<P>If you are not prepared to go so far, then you must have a method of
<BR>
seperating slackers from true charity cases, or wear the overhead of
<BR>
supporting slackers. I do not accept that anyone has demonstrated a
<BR>
reasonable method of slacker seperation (the method mentioned above classing
<BR>
as an unreasonable method). If you feel that you can provide such, then I'm
<BR>
interested to hear it.
<BR>
<P>==================
<BR>
<P>A fundamental premise of mine in support of welfare for non-self supporting
<BR>
families is as follows:
<BR>
<P>Children provide benefit to individuals in the same society other than
<BR>
themselves and their immediate family. More strongly, all individuals derive
<BR>
benefit from future generations at such time as those generations reach
<BR>
working age, barring those who do not survive to this point.
<BR>
<P>This premise was challenged by Mike and Brian - thank you both. I have
<BR>
(erroneously) taken this as given, and need to provide some support.
<BR>
<P>Here's a stab at supporting the premise above:
<BR>
<P>We are looking at a future time when those of working age today are self
<BR>
supporting retirees. That is, these individuals possess some form of
<BR>
capital, but do not contribute services, or at least not in equal proportion
<BR>
to their consumption of services.
<BR>
<P>Did these self supporting retirees provide a next generation, or not? If
<BR>
they did, then this next generation, now forming the bulk of the workforce,
<BR>
provide services as required by the economy (and mostly by those with
<BR>
capital). In this environment, capital has a reasonable value in terms of
<BR>
services; those with capital can use it to acquire services; those who can
<BR>
provide services can gain capital.
<BR>
<P>If there was no next generation established, so that there are only, or
<BR>
mostly, individuals of retirement age, all self funded, with large
<BR>
accumulated stores of capital, then there is an undersupply of service. So
<BR>
the value of capital compared to services becomes very small. The small to
<BR>
non-existant working age population can demand outrageously high prices in
<BR>
return for their services, because of this undersupply. What do the self
<BR>
funded retirees do about this?
<BR>
<P>They can provide the services themselves. This takes them out of the league
<BR>
of retirees and puts them back into the workforce. This is a positive move,
<BR>
but may not be everyone's desire for later life; after all, why did they
<BR>
accumulate that vast supply of capital in the first place, if they cannot
<BR>
retire on it?
<BR>
<P>Or, they can ship in a workforce from other countries; there are sure to be
<BR>
workers somewhere who want a slice of this great pile of dollars. However,
<BR>
these workers come from somewhere; what is happening in this case is that
<BR>
your entire nation is free-riding on the work of other nations, by creaming
<BR>
off the brightest of their workforce for yourself, whilst never having to
<BR>
contribute to the training and support which produced them. This happens
<BR>
today, of course; western nations only take the really skilled &amp; educated
<BR>
migrants if they can help it; there is no compensation for this brain drain.
<BR>
<P>Another possibility is to automate all services; thus, we don't need a
<BR>
workforce. A truly lights-out workforce, as envisaged by Drexler with
<BR>
nanotech+AI, will do some very funny things to the economy, not to mention
<BR>
other side effects of singularity. I don't presume to be able to predict the
<BR>
outcome of the singularity, and so cannot present any useful analysis of
<BR>
this case (which is a pity; it looks like this is the way things are
<BR>
actually going). Any lesser automation of the service side of the economy
<BR>
will leave a substantial need for brain work which would become enormously
<BR>
expensive, as above. See the IT industry (hurrah!) for an early example of
<BR>
this effect.
<BR>
<P>Possibly the undersupply of people to provide services would be alleviated
<BR>
by a combination of lesser-than-nanotech/AI automation and of the skilled
<BR>
and aged staying in the workforce to provide the harder mental service work.
<BR>
However, even in this economy I wouldn't like to be planning to be a self
<BR>
funded retiree, unless I'd accumulated a very, very big fund base for my
<BR>
retirement. Mostly retirees need services, and as retiree demand would be
<BR>
the major factor in the economy, these services would go sky-high.
<BR>
<P>==================
<BR>
<P>I have tried to demonstrate above that the children born now will provide
<BR>
high indirect benefit to those currently active in the economy, by way of
<BR>
showing the drop in the value of accumulated capital in comparison to
<BR>
services, if those children are not present. This translates to saying that
<BR>
there is a high, high cost of not having those children present. Future
<BR>
generations do indeed provide benefit to those alive now, including those
<BR>
who pay and those free-riders who do not.
<BR>
<P>The only way around this is to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- take over the job of the future generations yourself (work forever),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- poach future generations from elsewhere (and thus free-ride in any
<BR>
case)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- or to move to uber-automation, and thus the singularity.
<BR>
<P>Myself, I'd say &quot;Bring on the singularity&quot;! But I'll still bet on future
<BR>
generations being useful.
<BR>
<P>Emlyn
<BR>
Tele-brain-drainee, currently sucking capital out of countries who forgot to
<BR>
train people to do useful work. Whoops!
<BR>
<P>Disclaimer: Any similarity of the postor to anyone with training in
<BR>
economics, alive or dead, is purely coincidental.

<P><P><EM>&gt; The DINKS and others need to be free to develop their own retirement
</EM><BR>
accounts,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; rather than having their wealth siphoned off by the welfare state. If they
</EM><BR>
do
<BR>
<EM>&gt; this, they won't need much of a next generation to pay for their
</EM><BR>
retirement.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A criminal in prison, depending on the location, costs from $30,000.00 to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $60,000.00 a year to house. A person on welfare makes between $14,000.00
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; $35,000.00, again depending on location, dependents, etc.. counting the
</EM><BR>
50%
<BR>
<EM>&gt; bureaucratic overhead on that welfare tab, you are talking about a $28k to
</EM><BR>
$70k
<BR>
<EM>&gt; overall cost per year to keep someone on welfare. Many of the state
</EM><BR>
sponsored
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 'workfare' programs are similarly expensive, typically such programs spend
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; minimum of $100,000.00 for every low level job they place a welfare
</EM><BR>
recipient
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in. Part of that is subsidies to the employer, part overhead, etc.

<EM>&gt; Abortion in the US, by a large margin, has become not a means by which a
</EM><BR>
low
<BR>
<EM>&gt; income single woman can end a pregnancy to prevent bring a child into a
</EM><BR>
poor
<BR>
<EM>&gt; life (though that is still present), it is mostly a method by which
</EM><BR>
well-off or
<BR>
<EM>&gt; well to do middle and upper class women can eliminate any possible drag on
</EM><BR>
their
<BR>
<EM>&gt; careers and upwardly mobile lifestyle. Look up the numbers for yourself.
</EM><BR>
Middle
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and upper class single women abort more frequently per capita than poor
</EM><BR>
women.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's a link on abortion opinions by class:

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While heres an indication that the reasons women have for abortion have
</EM><BR>
nothing
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to do with the health of the mother or baby, or that they were victims of

rape:

<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     although this one does say that 68% of women state that they 'can't
</EM><BR>
afford a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; baby right now', they don't explain what that means, whether its truly an
</EM><BR>
income
<BR>
<EM>&gt; thing, or whether they can't afford the impact it will have on their

careers...
