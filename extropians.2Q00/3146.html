<P>
The phrase &quot;You can't touch the same river twice&quot; comes to mind here!
<BR>
<P>As equally true that you can and cannot touch the same river twice, it is 
<BR>
also equally true that the self is a static thing (noun) and also a dynamic 
<BR>
action (verb).
<BR>
<P>Sometimes when two sides of an position seem equally true, we are asking the 
<BR>
wrong question, and so I take an oblique view, an answer to this thread may 
<BR>
be integration of paradox.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Harvey Newstrom &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Can%20I%20kill%20the%20&quot;original&quot;?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000516170417.91084.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</A>&gt; Wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;I claim that they are thinking the same thoughts because the copy's
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;blank brain just got overwritten with the original's thoughts.
</EM><BR>
<P>If a computer file is overwritten by the exact same file it is not erased.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt; My definition of &quot;one&quot; person is:  single consciousness not about to 
</EM><BR>
diverge
<BR>
<EM>     &gt; in thinking, in a single location, connected to all parts of itself.
</EM><BR>
<P>A brain can not detect its position so if consciousness even has a location
<BR>
(Where is &quot;red&quot; or the number 17?) it must be  where its sense data
<BR>
originated. It's easy to put a splitter on a data line so several different
<BR>
conscious entities could exist at the same location, or several brains
<BR>
could generate the same consciousness at the same location.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt; I argue that the only way that something can happen to one and not 
</EM><BR>
the other
<BR>
<EM>     &gt;is if they are two separate entities in the first place.
</EM><BR>
<P>Everybody on this list received you post, it was the same message,  they 
<BR>
were all
<BR>
identical, you only wrote one post. But now I changed one &quot;i&quot; to a &quot;e&quot; and 
<BR>
so now
<BR>
they can be distinguished, there are now 2 different messages.
<BR>
<P><EM>       &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>       &gt;&gt;If I made a billion copies a second and destroyed a billion copies 
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>       &gt;&gt;second from the day you were born there would be no change in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>       &gt;&gt;subjective  feelings you experience at this very instant because as
</EM><BR>
<EM>       &gt;&gt;you say, you can't  tell if  you're a copy or the original, in fact 
</EM><BR>
the entire
<BR>
<EM>       &gt;&gt;concept of &quot;the original&quot; is meaningless  in this case.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>     &gt; Here you have added the concept of destroying copies of me.  I don't 
</EM><BR>
mind
<BR>
<EM>     &gt; copies being created, but please don't destroy them.
</EM><BR>
<P>No. I've been making a billion Harvey Newstroms and destroying a billion
<BR>
Harvey Newstroms every second and will continue to do so. How are you
<BR>
any poorer for it?
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;The original Harvey Newstrom has been lost.
</EM><BR>
<P>There never was an original Harvey Newstrom, I've been doing this
<BR>
a billion times every second since the day you were born. It's my hobby.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;The killed copies have died.  The last remaining copy is still alive.
</EM><BR>
<P>But the last remaining copy is only &quot;alive&quot; for 10^-9 seconds and that's
<BR>
far too short a time to form a complete thought, and yet you still think,
<BR>
you still feel alive, you still feel that life is continuos, and you didn't 
<BR>
even
<BR>
know I was doing this to you until I told you. Despite the trillions you say
<BR>
have &quot;died&quot; something lives on, your conscious continues uninterrupted.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt; A brain that was thinking thoughts and would have kept thinking 
</EM><BR>
thoughts
<BR>
<EM>     &gt;if left alone has suddenly  been forced to stop thinking thoughts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;This is my definition of death.
</EM><BR>
<P>Every time I talk to you I change you, I cause you to think thoughts you 
<BR>
would
<BR>
not have thought if I'd kept my mouth shut. Do I commit murder whenever
<BR>
I say &quot;hello&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM>        &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;I have a red tomato in my right hand and a red apple in my left 
</EM><BR>
hand, but
<BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;I don't think the tomato is communicating with the apple telling 
</EM><BR>
it how to be red.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;But you are not claiming that the tomato is the apple. Bad analogy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well actually, although my world famous, incredibly intense, completely mind 
<BR>
bowing
<BR>
godlike modesty makes me hesitate to say so,  I think it's a damn good 
<BR>
analogy.
<BR>
Neither the tomato nor the apple is important, only red is important. 
<BR>
Neither carbon
<BR>
atoms or hydrogen atoms are important, only you and I are important.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;Give me an anology where you claim that the objects in either hand are 
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>     &gt;same object, even if they are not touching or communicating.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, I hold the number 17 in my right hand and in my left.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;What theory of mine are you testing?
</EM><BR>
<P>What a copy is, what the original is, at what point one changes into the
<BR>
other, and most important of all your theory that it matters.
<BR>
