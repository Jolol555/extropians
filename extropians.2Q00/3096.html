<P>
I found Robert Freitas' &quot;aerovore&quot; scenario from
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/NanoRev/Ecophagy.html">http://www.foresight.org/NanoRev/Ecophagy.html</A> to be particularly
<BR>
interesting.  This depends on being able to make a replicator which is
<BR>
built entirely from C, H, O and N atoms.
<BR>
<P>It is pretty questionable whether that is possible - most moderately
<BR>
large nanotech designs to date require some percentage of larger atoms,
<BR>
metals and the like.  Also, the nanosynthesis processes described in
<BR>
Nanosystems often do make use of additional elements.
<BR>
<P>But if it can be done, the aerovore can replicate from atmospheric gasses
<BR>
alone: O2 and N2, of course, with carbon coming from CO2 and hydrogen
<BR>
from H2O vapor.  And in fact the replication rate is reasonably fast;
<BR>
the paper estimates based on both energy and gas-flow considerations
<BR>
that the aerovore can replicate in under an hour.
<BR>
<P>These things would therefore be a solar-powered dust which could float in
<BR>
the air and make more of themselves.  Incredibly, starting with a single
<BR>
aerovore with Robert Freitas' design parameters (275 nm diameter, 2750
<BR>
second reproduction time), the atmosphere is so filled with these guys
<BR>
after 1.85 days that sunlight is dimmed by 1%; and after 2.0 days 100%
<BR>
of the sunlight is blocked from reaching the surface.
<BR>
<P>This is an amazingly virulent threat.  The paper's solution is to send
<BR>
up a bunch of good nanites which will build a giant net around the
<BR>
entire earth, then pull it inward and sieve every cubic micron of the
<BR>
atmosphere in order to remove these beasties.  You've also got to check
<BR>
out the lungs of all the animals, where some trillions of aerovores will
<BR>
reside, and get all those out too.  Presumably every square micron of
<BR>
the earth's surface must be checked as well.
<BR>
<P>Then of course if they miss any they have to start all over again.
<BR>
<P>All I can say is, we better hope that it's not possible to build CHON
<BR>
replicators.  This atmospheric net idea doesn't look very promising to me.
