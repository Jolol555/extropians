<EM>&gt; My point exactly, but you and Zero seem to think that some european
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; court is gonna issue an arrest warrant to the FFL to apprehend Bill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Gates from his pad in Medina and that the US Gov't is just gonna sit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idly by and let this shit go on.

<BR>
No, I don't believe that. What I _do_ believe is that it's possible
<BR>
that some senior Microsoft France execs may end up doing time, and Bill
<BR>
will have to take care where his flights land in case some zealous
<BR>
prosecutor decides to arrest him for complicity if he lands on French
<BR>
territory.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Ahem: Champagne and Burgundy are _regions_ of France. Their produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is appelation controlee, meaning it's graded by quality. This is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some extent a hold-over from the agricultural age, and you'll note the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tendency to name modern wines by the grape they're produced from -- which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; isn't a controlled designation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If someone in California makes wine that is indistinguishable from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; champagne to a panel of tasters in a double blind test, it is champagne,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and they should be free to call it that. 
</EM><BR>
<P>By that reasoning, if I can make an operating system that is
<BR>
indistinguishable from Windows (presumably by reverse-engineering all
<BR>
their APIs), I should be free to call it Windows. Right?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Accepting the claims of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; French for 'cultural heritage', when that 'heritage' is nothing more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than a desire to maintain their elite attitude as being the 'superior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; culture' of the planet is ludicrous.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nonsense. Appelation controlee status is just a variation on trademark
<BR>
law, one that you don't recognize because you're a parochial-minded
<BR>
American with very little experience of the outside world.
<BR>
<P>Calling Californian bubbly &quot;Champagne&quot; is an attempt to violate the
<BR>
regional trademark.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Anheur-Busch are still allowed to call their product &quot;Budweiser&quot; in most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; parts of Europe (although in the Czech republic and Switzerland &quot;Budweiser&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is an apellation controlee and AB's product isn't brewed in the right way or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the right place to carry the name &quot;Budweiser&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Frankly I side with the Czechs. Budweiser (american) sucks. It would do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us good to make them produce their products to a quality standard (any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quality standard, just name one...)
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
You realise you've just swapped sides in this argument?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Ahem. How much of Airbus is government owned? I seem to recall some rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; large shareholders that are private companies, like British Aerospace ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I guess you're just sore because Airbus is outselling Boeing 60/40 at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; present, without the hidden subsidy of military R&amp;D contracts  ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So the government subsidy of the workers benefits packages isn't a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subsidy????
</EM><BR>
<P>Of _course_ it's a subsidy! So is the F-22 contract Boeing is feeding off.
<BR>
What annoys me is the hypocrisy of US politicians claiming that it's
<BR>
unfair for Airbus to receive government subsidies when their own big
<BR>
aerospace contractor is snarfing billions out of the public trough under
<BR>
the rubric &quot;defense spending&quot;, although the government has little or no
<BR>
interest in buying actual military hardware built with that money. A
<BR>
good chunk of it ends up feeding into civilian R&amp;D, in much the same way that
<BR>
the Boeing 747 got started as a re-working of Boeing's failed bid for the
<BR>
C-5 contract.
<BR>
<P>Look, the issue here is that governments play favourites with their 
<BR>
domestic markets. And they aren't going to stop, either, because if one
<BR>
stops, the others will continue; their own companies will enjoy a
<BR>
competitive advantage, and governments still see companies based on their
<BR>
soil as strategic assets (paying tax to them).
<BR>
<P>This is an entirely different issue from trademark law, and variants
<BR>
thereon like the appelation controllee stuff (which doesn't exist in
<BR>
the USA but is widely recognized as having the weight of trademark
<BR>
law elsewhere in the world).  Incidentally, it can be argued that those
<BR>
Californian bubbly producers who call their produce Champagne have exactly
<BR>
the same relationship to the real thing that Chinese software pirates
<BR>
have with Microsoft: they're simply infringing a form of intellectual
<BR>
property that isn't recognized [much] in their home country.
