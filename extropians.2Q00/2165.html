<EM>&gt; You may be a little out of touch with the market then.  Java is rapidly

<EM>&gt; a major turd on the front-end, hence why you don't usually see Java there,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but on the back-end it represents a very acceptable trade-off of features
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as a development environment.  Java is becoming a defacto standard for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server-side web work, largely because it is superior to most other options

<P>I'm well aware of the market. Java is the current fad in the UNIX world, but
<BR>
I've seen lots of fads come and go. Java hasn't been around long enough to
<BR>
produce very many large-scale applications, and EJB is even younger. Most of
<BR>
the current feeding frenzy is therefore centered around trying to figure out
<BR>
how the technology works, rather than actually doing something useful with
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>Now, I was actually commenting on the state of industry marketing hype,
<BR>
rather than the technology itself. But if you want to talk about the merits
<BR>
of Java, we can do that - I actually think it is a pretty good environment,
<BR>
especially compared to C. However, modern component technology is better for
<BR>
solving actual business needs than straight Java, and EJB has some serious
<BR>
problems that put it at a disadvantage vs. COM+.
