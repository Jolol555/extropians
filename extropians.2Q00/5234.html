John Grigg quotes Nature, as forwarded by Robin:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;There is no such thing as bad publicity, it is sometimes said. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever since Eric Drexler brought the term 'nanotechnology' into vogue in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his 1986 book Engines of Creation, some researchers have felt that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; field has been burdened by unwanted baggage. Drexler envisioned an era
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in which factory production lines were replaced by  self-replicating,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanoscale 'assemblers'  and warned that such entities could supplant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans to become the dominant 'life' forms on our planet. These ideas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were quickly seized on by transhumanists - people who imagine what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world will look like after technology has rendered us extinct.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose that if they had said &quot;posthumanists&quot; it wouldn't have been
<BR>
too bad a definition.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So let me get this right, the author was saying transhumanists are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a bunch of science groupies??  Is Drexler our Elvis or Paul McCartney?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Did the article point out that Drexler himself &quot;encouraged&quot; these people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by forming _The Foresight Institute_?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, the article didn't say anything more about Drexler.  In fact my
<BR>
perception is that the whole field is doing its best to pretend that
<BR>
he doesn't exist.  I predict that the Foresight conference will soon
<BR>
no longer be the premier nanotech conference.  The real academics will
<BR>
want to disassociate themself from the nanofanatics and set up a more
<BR>
respectable venue.  (Maybe this has happened already; I don't follow
<BR>
the research.)
<BR>
<P>I can't help thinking that a core problem is cryonics.  Cryonicists have
<BR>
been hoping that nanotech will give them respectability for 15 years now.
<BR>
In fact, the opposite seems to have happened.  Cryonics is so disreputable
<BR>
for most people, so firmly entrenched in the nonsense/fraud category,
<BR>
that the least association with the practice is enough to discredit
<BR>
any activity.  Drexler wrote about repairing the damage from cryonic
<BR>
suspension in Engines, and thereby permanently branded his form of
<BR>
nanotech as nonsense, for many observers.
<BR>
<P>If Drexlerian nanotech comes about, in the full flower of its predicted
<BR>
power, then there is a decent chance that cryonic suspension will work.
<BR>
And that means that everyone who has allowed a loved one to die has,
<BR>
in effect, murdered that person.  This would be an intolerable moral
<BR>
burden for most people, making it hard for them to think clearly about
<BR>
where this technology may lead.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm glad to see the author admits nanotech is taking off now.  I still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember the infamous _Scientific American_ article that slammed nanotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believers as a &quot;cargo cult.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>The Science article really didn't change this view.  They seemed to be
<BR>
drawing a distinction between the blue-sky dreams of Drexler and the
<BR>
practical, concrete research going on today in labs studying buckytubes
<BR>
and crystals (much of which is not really that closely related to nanotech
<BR>
as we know it).
<BR>
<P>The article even had something negative to say about Bill Joy's critique,
<BR>
because it envisioned dangers from Drexlerian nanotech.  This is far
<BR>
beyond the limited perceptual horizon of the article's author.
<BR>
