<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But if it doesn't jive with your goals, with which goals does it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conflict?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've already made the case that it doesn't conflict with your desire for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;self&quot; preservation, whatever &quot;self&quot; turns out to be. Rather, instead, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only seems to conflict with your goal to preserve consciousness streams.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And as far as I can tell, you adopted that position because you took it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that this was the only way to preserve your &quot;self&quot;.  I'm arguing that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is not the case, that you can preserve yourself while stunting your own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; conciousness streams.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Again, wrong.  I don't like my self.  I think it should be better.  The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;body
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should be upgraded.  The brain should be faster.  The thoughts should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more advanced.  The activities should be god-like.  This is transhumanism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I want to evolve so far that I no longer bear much resemblance to my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self.  I have no desire to preserve anything of myself now, just as I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;miss any features missing from feotus-Harvey who no longer exists.  I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want to extend my current consciousness stream so that I am around to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experience the god-like Harvey.  If that stream ends, then I miss out on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;show.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I really do want to preserve my current consciousness stream.  I really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't care about preserving any portions of my &quot;self&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that the bulk (if not all) of the problem here is one of semantics.  
<BR>
I want &quot;me&quot; to live forever.  I'm sure you each feel the same way about 
<BR>
&quot;you.&quot;  The problem is in defining who &quot;I&quot; am.  Is it the hunk of meat that 
<BR>
constitutes my brain?  Is it the patterns of neurons and synapses that 
<BR>
happen to exist in that hunk of meat?  Or is it that collection of 
<BR>
experiences that I happen to remember?  IMO, therein lies the rub.  With the 
<BR>
technology of the past (and the present) the answer to that question didn't 
<BR>
really matter because the one could not be separated from the other.  Once 
<BR>
the technology is available which will allow that separation (while 
<BR>
permitting the other pieces to remain in tact), this question becomes of 
<BR>
*paramount* importance.
<BR>
<P>If your recollected experiences can be separated (or copied) from the 
<BR>
patterns in your brain, and the patterns in your brain can be separated (or 
<BR>
copied) from the brain itself, which (if any) of these three things would 
<BR>
you consider to be &quot;you&quot;?  I believe that your answer to this question will 
<BR>
tell you what it is about you that you most want to preserve.
<BR>
