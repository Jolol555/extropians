<P>
Excuse me, but isn't this discussion rather pointless?
<BR>
<P>I think it is more important to be a cosmopolitan than a patriot, because 
<BR>
nations are just construtions. What distinguishes a Mexican from a Honduran? 
<BR>
Nothing, just political boundaries. And I personally see that I have more in 
<BR>
common with people on this international list than with most Swedes.
<BR>
<P>Fighting for civil liberties is very good, but just doing it in your own 
<BR>
country won't do it, because the world is so closely connected.
<BR>
<P>Think locally, act globally!
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Waldemar Ingdahl
<BR>
<P>Peoples of the world, globalize!
