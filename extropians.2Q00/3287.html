<BR>
<P>Summary:  Encysted gastrula embryos of the
<BR>
crustacean Artemia franciscana have acquired
<BR>
an array of adaptations that enable them to
<BR>
survive a wide variety of environmental
<BR>
extremes. The present paper shows that at
<BR>
least 60% survive 4 years of continuous
<BR>
anoxia at physiological temperatures
<BR>
(20-23 C) when fully hydrated. Although these
<BR>
embryos appear to carry on a metabolism
<BR>
during the first day of anoxia, no evidence
<BR>
for a continuing metabolism throughout the
<BR>
subsequent 4 years was obtained. During
<BR>
this period, there were no measurable changes
<BR>
in the levels of their stored, mobilizable
<BR>
carbohydrates (trehalose, glycogen, glycerol).
<BR>
Calculations indicate that, if these carbohydrates
<BR>
are being utilized at all during anoxia, the rate
<BR>
is at least 50,000 times lower than the aerobic
<BR>
rate (lower limit of detection). Indications of
<BR>
proteolysis during prolonged anoxia were
<BR>
sought but not found. Under starvation conditions,
<BR>
the life span of larvae produced from embryos
<BR>
that had undergone 4 years of anoxia was not
<BR>
significantly different from that of larvae produced
<BR>
by embryos that had not experienced anoxia.
<BR>
thus, all substrates and other metabolites
<BR>
required to support embryonic development
<BR>
to the nauplius, as well as endogenous (unfed)
<BR>
larval growth and molting, are retained during
<BR>
4 years of anoxia. It is not possible to prove
<BR>
experimentally that absence of a metabolic
<BR>
rate in anoxic embryos under physiological
<BR>
conditions of hydration and temperature.
<BR>
Nevertheless, on the basis of the results
<BR>
presented here, I will make the case that the
<BR>
anoxic embryo brings its metabolism to a
<BR>
reversible standstill. Such a conclusion requires
<BR>
that these embryos maintain their structural
<BR>
integrity in the absence of measurable
<BR>
biosynthesis and free energy flow and are thus
<BR>
an exception to a major biological generality.
<BR>
Potential mechanisms involved in their stability
<BR>
are discussed.
