<EM>&gt; I'm pretty cynical when it comes to government, and my opinion is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spending time and resources lobbying it or otherwise participating in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process is a waste. You really have to find some way to jump outside of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.

<EM>&gt; Does anyone know if Havenco/Sealand is going to establish a bank and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; online stock brokerage?
</EM><BR>
<P>According to the WIRED article in the printed version, they have an agreement
<BR>
with a bank already to set up an offshore virtual bank. They were being
<BR>
typically cagey as to exactly which bank it is, probably for good reason. Until
<BR>
they are up and operating, it probably would not be difficult for national
<BR>
governments to put pressure on any institutions headquartered in their own
<BR>
territory to cease and desist dealing with Sealand. Considering how much the US
<BR>
and other governments have leaned on the Swiss, the Carribean nations,
<BR>
Lichtenstein, etc. on opening their systems up to scrutiny, I think their desire
<BR>
to keep things secret at this point is well justified.
<BR>
<P>Now, using the 'dereliction of Sovereignty' doctrine that the Prince of Sealand
<BR>
used to get established, it might be possible to use a little subterfuge to
<BR>
claim some out of the way island that is claimed by a nation. Since those little
<BR>
spits typically only get visited once a year, and a year seems to be the term
<BR>
needed to be able to squat and pull the dereliction of sovereignty bit, it might
<BR>
not be too difficult to bribe the officer commanding the visiting naval vessel
<BR>
to 'forget' to visit a particular island one year.... of course, it would have
<BR>
to be a good bribe, in the order of a million bucks as well as the post of
<BR>
Minister of Defense in the new micronation....
