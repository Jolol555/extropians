<EM>&gt;  You want to end welfare?  OK, so do I.  But you have to give people the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  means with which to make their own way in the world.  If I'm ignorant, 
</EM><BR>
poor, 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  uneducated and unskilled and you kick me and my kids out into the streets 
</EM><BR>
to 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  starve, you have de facto turned me into a criminal.  I will rob everyone 
</EM><BR>
in 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sight.  I will soon be caught and put in jail then, guess what?  Free room 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and board on your dime again.  Nice solution.

<P>True. Social services fill a need and are provided because most people can 
<BR>
see the cause and effect of the spending vs. the state of affairs. This is 
<BR>
the big dumb-dumb factor of Libertarian politics. It ignores causation. It 
<BR>
asserts that &quot;things will work themselves out&quot; as soon as we stop 
<BR>
interfering. 
<BR>
<P>Pound foolish, penny wise.
<BR>
<P>Fact:
<BR>
A full-blown Harvard Education costs a fraction of what it costs to house a 
<BR>
criminal from age fifteen for life. But some people don't want to pay a 
<BR>
school tax to pay for 
<BR>
K-12 education and God forbid one should provide childcare for a poor kid, 
<BR>
they'd much rather wait and pay their tax bucks to punish him after he's 
<BR>
killed a cop or a store clerk -- or perhaps their mom. 
<BR>
<P>Here's another political incongruity: 
<BR>
Most people who are pro-life (antiabortion) are FOR the death penalty. 
<BR>
; - ) 
<BR>
<P>I guess it's OK to kill children, as long as you wait until they grow up -- 
<BR>
unwanted and in poverty -- so they can kill someone else first! 
<BR>
<P>Groan......
