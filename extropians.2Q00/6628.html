<EM>&gt; Greetings,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         I'm interested in the supposed effects of operating on unusual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sleep schedules, generally, working throughout the night and sleeping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; throughout the day, with variations occurring with some frequency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm also interested in any currently available methods of dealing with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these effects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         As I understand it, melatonin is responsible for the reset of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the biological clock and is released during the night.
</EM><BR>
<P>Correct.
<BR>
<P>Specifically, the retina is linked to the supra-chiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
<BR>
in the hypothalamus, which is linked in turn to the pineal gland, where
<BR>
melatonin is released. (In birds and reptiles, the pineal gland resides
<BR>
beneath a thin part of the skull, and is directly light sensitive).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've frequently been told that when you are forced to operate on night
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hours, the best way to ward off sleepiness is to work in a low or no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light environment, as this triggers the release of melatonin.
</EM><BR>
<P>This seems the wrong way round; melatonin release is in general the
<BR>
trigger for sleepiness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	Further, are there any technologies in development that are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feasible tools to reduce the general amount of sleep required by an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual?
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been asking the same thing (the 'Sleep? What is sleep, citizen?'
<BR>
thread on the <A HREF="mailto:transhuman@logrus.org?Subject=Re:%20Alteration%20of%20sleep%20patterns.&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000630112846.J754@melchior&gt;">transhuman@logrus.org</A> list). Selection attatched.

<BR>
<P>One of the most famous examples of sleep deprivation is that of Randy

Gardner, who remained awake for 11 days (264 hours) in 1964. His vision
<BR>
became blurred, his speech less coherent and he suffered from mild
<BR>
paranoia; but there were no lasting effects and Horne (1988), concluded
<BR>
from looking at a number of studies that no subjects have displayed
<BR>
significant symptoms beyond those in Gardner's case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is possible that sleep is used for training the neural networks in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our brains, during downtime.
</EM><BR>
<P>Possibly. It's also quite likely that REM and slow wave sleep serve
<BR>
different purposes. Oswald (1966) proposed that brain restoration is
<BR>
taking place during REM, and body repair during slow wave sleep. Cell
<BR>
division does take place at increased rates during all stages of sleep,
<BR>
and babies sleep lots. Studies of marathon runners and other athletes
<BR>
found they underwent more slow-wave sleep after a race, but some lab
<BR>
studies disagree.
<BR>
<P>There's interesting results from certain antidepressants (particularly
<BR>
tricyclics) also. People taking these were observed to undergo less REM
<BR>
sleep each night; furthermore, when the treatment was stopped they did
<BR>
not show the partial catch-up of lost REM which has been observed after
<BR>
sleep deprivation experiments. The action of these drugs is to boost
<BR>
neurotransmitter levels (esp. serotonin and noradrenaline). Morgane
<BR>
(1974) suggests neurotransmitters are being restored during REM.
<BR>
<P>Note that REM is concurrent with dreaming, and dreaming has been
<BR>
suggested to have a number of functions. Both Evans (1984) and Crick &amp;
<BR>
Mitchison (1983) suggest consolidation of information, construction and
<BR>
modification of schema, and discarding of irrelevant material take place
<BR>
during dreaming.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Research I bumped into a whle back indicates that when we first learn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a new skill, we get a major boost in skill level over the first night
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following learning the skill.  This indicates that useful work is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going on while we sleep.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's counter studies to this which fail to find significant

difference between skill levels in people who have slept after learning

and people who have just done something else for the same amount of

time.

<P>No, it isn't.
<P>My post was intended simply to raise the issue of the functions of sleep
and its potential removal from human programming, as it occured to me it
was one area for potential human improvement that seemed to have been
overlooked.
<P>To provide some fuel to potential discussion, I provided a brief outline
of some of the theories and research, based on my limited knowledge of
the area.
<P>I was certainly not disputing the dangers of a lack of awareness. But a
lack of awareness, although a known effect of sleep deprivation, is the
cause of your accident and not the sleep deprivation itself.
<P>I make this distinction because there are memes in circulation claiming
that sleep deprivation is dangerous - 'dangerous' in the sense of 'not
sleeping for X days will kill you' etc. It is claims like these that
Horne was disputing. Incidentally, my intention was simply to state the
opinions of various involved researchers, not any of my own - although I
realise in retrospect that my wording did not reflect this. Sorry! :-)

&gt; ...
&gt; &gt;Sleeping itself seems to have evolved because it is most efficient for an
&gt; &gt;organism's physical and behavioral traits to be primed for either night or
&gt; &gt;day activities, and to become inactive during the period when it is
&gt; &gt;inneficient (same obvious utility as hibernation).
&gt; 
&gt; This is a good theory. But it doesn't explain what I've heard about dolphin
&gt; sleep. I've heard that scans of dolphin brains show the distinctive
&gt; waveforms associated with sleep in humans. But only one hemisphere at a
&gt; time -- apparently their hemispheres alternate, taking turns &quot;sleeping&quot;.
<P>Yes, many species of dolphin sleep in this manner. I have a reference
for research into bottlenoses. Somewhere...
<P>Also of interest is the Indus dolphin, which 'microsleeps' for brief
periods all through day and night.
<P>&gt; &gt;Can we
&gt; &gt;compress the mind-tuning tasks (and whatever else mammalian evolution has
&gt; &gt;used the downtime for) into a shorter time period?  Or during times when our
&gt; &gt;brain isn't doing much anyway (watching tv, driving)-- we're probably doing
&gt; &gt;a little already.
&gt; 
&gt; Good question. In general, it's good to ask for *any* activity that uses up
&gt; our limited time, is there a better way ? One that takes less
&gt; time/energy/material, and/or generates more/better results.
<P>Exactly the questions I intended to raise. Although at the extreme end
of the spectrum, I was including the possibility of modifications such
that whatever processes were really essential could be ongoing in the
background, or redistributed in some way - anything better than
requiring us to spend a large fractions of our lives unconscious.

&gt; &gt;&gt;It occurs to me that much more research is needed into what sleep does
&gt; &gt;&gt;for us before we eliminate it.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes. The standard way of finding out what X does is to eliminate X from a
&gt; test group and see what differences occur between the test group and a
&gt; control group.
&gt; 
&gt; I have already conducted this experiment (in a sense), and have discovered
&gt; that I definitely need all the sleep I can get.
<P>I don't dispute, and never have,  that we currently 'need' sleep - i.e,
our functioning is impaired if we do not have it, to an increasing
degree.
<P>But the same 'need' applies to a drug addict.
<P>I am not suggesting that we are merely 'addicted' to sleep, and need to
wean ourselves off it. Removing the requirement for it will involve
actual modifications. But I do suggest that there is no real logical
reason it should be required, and could be considered one of those
evolutionary cock-ups which does not easily remove itself by single
mutations.
