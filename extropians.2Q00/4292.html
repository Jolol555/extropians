<P>
My pal Jonathan Strahan, who lives in Perth Australia but works for Locus
<BR>
magazine in the USA, reviewed the following novel for Locus recently. I
<BR>
haven't seen it, but I've had a little contact with Justina as a
<BR>
`transrealist' writer. The book probably isn't available in the States yet.
<BR>
<P>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<BR>
<P>Justina Robson, Silver Screen (Macmillan, 0-333-75437-9, £9.99, 374pp, pb) 
<BR>
August 1999. Cover by Steve Stone.
<BR>
<P>Silver Screen, the first novel from new British writer Justina Robson, is an 
<BR>
engaging look at the barriers which exist between humankind and any possible 
<BR>
artificial or mechanical intelligence that we may create, and sits somewhere 
<BR>
between the work of Greg Egan and Dennis Danvers.
<BR>
<P>Anjuli O'Connell is a behavioural analyst working with 901 -- an artificial 
<BR>
intelligence housed in an orbital facility from which it runs a global 
<BR>
communications network for multinational corporation OptiNet. When long-time 
<BR>
friend and co-worker Ray Croft commits suicide - apparently by uploading his 
<BR>
personality into a virtual processor that claims unused processing time on 
<BR>
computers known only as &quot;the Schoal&quot; -- her life is thrown into disarray. 
<BR>
Croft, an advocate of machine rights and member of the Machine Greens, has 
<BR>
left a mysterious message for her on Earth and initiated a case in the World 
<BR>
Court of Human Rights to have 901 declared &quot;human&quot;. These two elements 
<BR>
provide the narrative drive for the novel. Croft's message leads O'Connell 
<BR>
back to Earth, where she tries to recover his notebook that apparently 
<BR>
contains an algorithm that will enable machines to achieve independent life. 
<BR>
The court case drives OptiNet into a panic where it tries to cut off the now 
<BR>
suspect O'Connell from access to 901, and to sufficiently disable it before 
<BR>
the court can provide a ruling. The action reaches a peak when O'Connell's 
<BR>
boyfriend undertakes a night raid on a religious cult using a terrifying 
<BR>
biomechanoid weapons-suit that pull its wearer into a mental symbiosis, a 
<BR>
new &quot;I&quot; continuous with the old but different.
<BR>
<P>There's a lot going on in this complex and complicated novel. Robson uses 
<BR>
O'Connell to ask just how could we hope to understand a truly artificial 
<BR>
intelligence? Why, other than for reasons to do with the history of its 
<BR>
programming, would an artificial intelligence be interested in us? And why, 
<BR>
given that we don't compete for similar resources, would an artificial 
<BR>
intelligence be hostile to biological life as postulated in Gregory 
<BR>
Benford's Galactic Centre novels? Robson also uses the experiences of Roy 
<BR>
Croft to pose questions that I've often pondered while reading novels like 
<BR>
Danvers' recent Circuit of Heaven and Egan's Permutation City: why would we 
<BR>
want to upload our personalities into a virtual environment, and why would 
<BR>
we imagine that it wouldn't fundamentally change us.
<BR>
<P>For all that a lot of the issues raised in Silver Screen have become the 
<BR>
normal stuff of science fiction since the publication of Gibson's 
<BR>
Neuromancer back in 1984, Robson's novel provides one of the more balanced 
<BR>
considerations of recent times. Less romanticised that Danvers, warmer than 
<BR>
Egan, Justina Robson's Silver Screen is a rewarding science fiction novel, 
<BR>
and a promising debut.
<BR>
<P>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<BR>
<P>Jonathan adds: It's since won an award or two.
