How can any state claim specficly that the right to Guns extends only to use 
<BR>
as a armed govmt millitia and not for personal use without violateing the 
<BR>
equal protection act when the Washington state constitution cleary states 
<BR>
they are for the individual citizen's  personal defense ?
<BR>
<P><P>SECTION 24 RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
<BR>
The right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself, or 
<BR>
the state, shall not be impaired, but nothing in this section shall be 
<BR>
construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize, maintain 
<BR>
or employ an armed body of men.

<EM> &gt; Hi!
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;If you're saying that you're a supporter of the people who are actively
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;trying to prevent me from owning guns, which I feel will be necessary to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;defend myself from either criminals or a tyrannical government, and if
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;nothing I say will change your mind, then it's most certainly not &quot;the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;end.&quot;  A potential rape victim may try to change her attacker's mind, 
</EM><BR>
but
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;when that doesn't work she may adopt a new course of action.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Yes, I am a supporter of the people who are actively trying to prevent 
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM> &gt; from owning guns. In fact, the less guns you and others like you own, the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; safer I feel and the safer America becomes.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Goodbye.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Don't confuse me with the facts, my mind is made up.&quot; Fortunately for us, 
<BR>
and
<BR>
unfortunately for you, a) your opinion is diametrically opposed to what the
<BR>
facts actually show, and b) one Belgians opinion doesn't mean jack over 
<BR>
here.
