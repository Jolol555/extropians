<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         April 26, 2000
<BR>
<P>SPIDER-WEB SENSOR REVEALS A FLAT UNIVERSE                
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspired by the elegant efficiency of spider webs, 
<BR>
researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, 
<BR>
Calif., have designed a tiny, web-shaped sensor that maps faint 
<BR>
structures in the early universe, reinforcing theories that the 
<BR>
cosmos is flat in its geometry. 
<BR>
<P>(A NASA news release describing the overall results may be found 
<BR>
at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/pressrel/2000/00-067.txt">ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/pressrel/2000/00-067.txt</A> .)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carried on an internationally sponsored balloon experiment 
<BR>
called BOOMERANG (Balloon Observations of Millimetric 
<BR>
Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics), the dime-sized sensor 
<BR>
known as a &quot;micromesh bolometer&quot; is a prime example of NASA's 
<BR>
success in developing miniaturized, high-performance technologies 
<BR>
for space missions. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just as spiders spin their webs with the least amount of 
<BR>
silk possible, we were able to eliminate 99 percent of the 
<BR>
material used by conventional bolometers,&quot; said Dr. James Bock, 
<BR>
who led in the detector's development at JPL's Microdevices 
<BR>
Laboratory.  &quot;The supporting material for our detector even has 
<BR>
the same thickness as a strand in a spider's web -- about one 
<BR>
micron thick, or one hundred times finer than a human hair.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using advanced micro-machining techniques, each section of 
<BR>
the sensor's web was designed to be smaller than the millimeter 
<BR>
wavelength of radiation streaming in from the cosmic microwave 
<BR>
background.  Created when the first atoms formed in the early 
<BR>
universe, the cosmic microwave background has cooled a thousand 
<BR>
times from its original temperature -- comparable to the hot 
<BR>
surface of the Sun -- to the cold, faint radiation seen today. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the cosmic microwave background is almost perfectly 
<BR>
uniform in all directions, the sensitivity of JPL's bolometer 
<BR>
allows scientists to capture temperature variations of only 100-
<BR>
millionths of a degree (0.0001 C) in just a few seconds of 
<BR>
observing time.   
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's sensitive enough to detect the heat given off by a 
<BR>
coffee maker all the way from the Moon,&quot; said Bock. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By measuring one small patch of sky after another over 
<BR>
several days of observation, the bolometers plot a map of the 
<BR>
cosmic background radiation, providing a snapshot of the universe 
<BR>
when the radiation formed about 300,000 years after the Big Bang. 
<BR>
At this time, regions with a higher density of matter and energy 
<BR>
left a record in the background radiation.  Wherever dense 
<BR>
regions existed, they left a faint imprint of slightly higher 
<BR>
temperatures. These fluctuations in the background serve as a 
<BR>
kind of fingerprint, allowing scientists to discriminate between 
<BR>
theories of cosmic development.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the bolometer's high level of sensitivity, the 
<BR>
BOOMERANG project was able to reveal density patterns in the 
<BR>
young universe that are consistent with an inflationary theory of 
<BR>
cosmic development. This theory proposes that, in the first 
<BR>
moments after the Big Bang, the universe went through a period of 
<BR>
extreme, exponential inflation. The theory further predicts a 
<BR>
&quot;flat&quot; geometry for the universe, because the immense stretching 
<BR>
of space during an inflationary period would have removed any 
<BR>
initially strong curvature in the smaller and denser early 
<BR>
universe.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Think of it this way,&quot; explains Bock.  &quot;If we were to 
<BR>
balance on a large ball, we would certainly feel the curvature 
<BR>
beneath our feet.  Expand that ball to the size of the Earth, and 
<BR>
we experience that space as flat.  Now think about blowing up 
<BR>
that ball to a cosmic scale, and you can imagine how inflation 
<BR>
would vastly flatten the visible universe.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To test cosmic development theories even further, future JPL 
<BR>
bolometers will fly on the European Space Agency's Far Infrared 
<BR>
and Submillimetre Telescope (FIRST) and Planck missions, both 
<BR>
scheduled for launch in 2007.  Using bolometers with 10 times 
<BR>
higher performance, Planck is expected to provide the definitive 
<BR>
map of variations in the cosmic microwave background, while FIRST 
<BR>
will survey some of the earliest galaxies.  In the meantime, 
<BR>
scientists will be studying the BOOMERANG map over the next few 
<BR>
years to gain a better understanding of the nature and 
<BR>
composition of matter in the universe.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BOOMERANG results were obtained through a balloon 
<BR>
experiment in 1998 that carried JPL's bolometer in a sensitive 
<BR>
receiver 36 kilometers (23 miles) above the atmosphere in 
<BR>
Antarctica.  Because Antarctica provides 24-hour sunlight and 
<BR>
winds that blow in a circular pattern around the continent, the 
<BR>
balloon experiment was able to maintain continuous measurements 
<BR>
over a 10-1/2 day period.   
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientific results will be published in the April 27 
<BR>
issue of Nature. Information on the BOOMERANG project can be 
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BOOMERANG Project was led by Dr. Andrew Lange of the 
<BR>
California Institute of Technology and by Dr. Paolo DeBernardis 
<BR>
of the University of Rome La Sapienza. Primary funding for 
<BR>
BOOMERANG was provided by the National Science Foundation and 
<BR>
NASA in the United States; the Italian Space Agency, the Italian 
<BR>
Antarctic Research Programme and the University of Rome La 
<BR>
Sapienza in Italy; and the Particle Physics and Astronomy 
<BR>
Research Council in the United Kingdom.  The Department of 
<BR>
Energy's National Energy Research Supercomputing Center provided 
<BR>
high-level computer analysis of the data.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Microdevices Laboratory is a state-of-the-art research 
<BR>
and technology-development facility in the Center for Space 
<BR>
Microelectronics Technology at JPL.  Funding for the micromesh 
<BR>
bolometer came from JPL's Technology and Applications Programs 
<BR>
Directorate.  JPL is managed by Caltech on behalf of NASA.
