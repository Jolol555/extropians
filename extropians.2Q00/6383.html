<HR NOSHADE><P>

<P>
Extropians,
<BR>
<P>I'm Stan Kretler.  I participated in the original discussion about 
<BR>
&quot;ultrahumanism&quot; and &quot;otherhumanisms&quot; from last year.
<BR>
<P>Just to set the record straight, &quot;setting the record straight&quot; about some 
<BR>
ancient use of &quot;ultrahumanism&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with Max and 
<BR>
Brian's dispute involving the term.
<BR>
<P>And, also for the record, *I* was the one who first took the time to look 
<BR>
the word up in a dictionary.  So I want credit for that! ;-)
<BR>
<P>&quot;ultra&quot; and &quot;human&quot; are common enough that it's absurd to think the two 
<BR>
haven't been combined many times in the past.  Any question about 
<BR>
originality here is about the use of &quot;ultrahuman&quot; in the context of a 
<BR>
discussion about possibly improved names for posthumanism.
<BR>
<P>But even that question of originality is still not relevant to how Max 
<BR>
treated Brian, which has nothing to do with any matter of originality.
<BR>
<P>What many of you don't know, by the way, is that Brian has actually 
<BR>
*defended* Max and the Extropy Institute many times among some acquaintances 
<BR>
and colleagues here.  He bristled when someone referred to it as &quot;rednecks 
<BR>
on the internet&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Even when people were telling him that Max was a sleaze bag for having the 
<BR>
gall to suggest (maybe suggest, or perhaps &quot;slyly suggest&quot; is the better 
<BR>
description) that Brian might have actually lifted the term from the 
<BR>
conference Web page, Brian kept searching for alternative explanations.
<BR>
<P>In fact, after I posted the OED definition (and or made some reference to 
<BR>
Brian's previous discussion of the question of the right name for 
<BR>
transhumanism), guess who came in to make sure that credit isn't unduly 
<BR>
taken away from Max?
<BR>
<P>Brian!  (He said to me, publicly, &quot;Extropians are capable of independent 
<BR>
thought, you'll discover&quot;!)
<BR>
<P><P>Personally, I think the matter should be dropped.  But if someone wants to 
<BR>
chime in, at least get the facts right.
<BR>
<P>The question that matters is why, after Max responded to the above with this
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For the record, I came us with &quot;ultrahuman&quot; several months ago, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thinking about my book and my talk for the conference. I was surprised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and amused to see your use of the term immediately before I first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;used the term publically at the conference (though it had been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the conference program for a while before that). This isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really surprising though. Several people have independently come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up with &quot;extropy&quot; and &quot;transhuman&quot; (or &quot;transhuman&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<P>- and Brian privately reminded Max of the earlier emails, and Max told Brian 
<BR>
he would correct the impression that Brian might have in fact stolen the 
<BR>
idea from the Web page, Max *never* responded.  Even after being reminded 
<BR>
twice.
<BR>
<P>Max looked, and esp now look*S*, rather bad.
<BR>
<P>The amazing thing is, Brian continued to defend Max and the Extropy 
<BR>
Institute, even though his friends thought it was obvious that Max was 
<BR>
jealously guarding his new idea about a better term for transhumanism, and 
<BR>
wanted Brian to look bad.  (What else can account for such behavior?  &quot;ooops 
<BR>
I forgot&quot; after repeated reminders isn't a very convincing excuse).
<BR>
<P>I doubt Brian will defend the Extropy Institute anymore, though.
<BR>
<P>Max did finally apologize, however, so perhaps Brian thinks the matter is 
<BR>
settled (he's out of town for a while I think.)
<BR>
<P>If people want to look things up in dictionaries, fine.  But don't pretend 
<BR>
it has any thing to do with Brian or Max.
<BR>
<P>As for Natasha......
<BR>
<P>Bye,
<BR>
Stan Kretler.
