<EM>&gt; &gt; I've heard that the age of armor (tanks) is over with the invention of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  shoulder launched anti tank rockets....but is that true?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Like the aircraft carrier, the death of the tank has been prophesied for some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time.  I do think the big lumbering giant M-1 is the last in that line; a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real dinosaur.  I see the armored vehicle of 2025 as very light, very fast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and very smart.  And maybe on legs instead of tracks.
</EM><BR>
<P>They will likely be AI guided, unmanned. I think the images of iraqi
<BR>
troops diving out of their tanks to save themselves from airborne attack
<BR>
during the gulf war gave all tank drivers the willies. I don't think
<BR>
you'll see legged tanks, because they just can't move fast enough,
<BR>
though you might have some specialized ones for rugged terrain and
<BR>
forest. On normal ground the tracks keep the vehicle from sinking into
<BR>
the ground, while legged vehicles would have too high a load per square
<BR>
foot of contact area to work on any but the most rocky hard packed
<BR>
desert. I do think you'll see large numbers of two man ATVs with
<BR>
missiles and guns on them.
