<P><EM>        &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;And do you really think there is a snowball's chance in hell of Congress
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;ever passing a law requiring universal surveillance unless they included
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;an exception for themselves and the President?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Short answer: yes.
</EM><BR>
<P>You know, I have some swamp land I'd really like to sell you, I think it has
<BR>
oil on it.
<BR>
<P><EM>        &gt;those politicians will have to at least appear to favor legislation demanded by
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;the people
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and I have no doubt they will continue to appear to do so,
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;Think term limits
</EM><BR>
<P>Which hasn't happened.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;and campaign finance reform.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which hasn't happened.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;For the criminally inclined, there are always clever ways to commit crimes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe you are correct.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; That does not mean that society will not criminalize acts which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; difficult to observe
</EM><BR>
<P>And I'm happy to say they will be just as effective as current laws that
<BR>
outlaw prostitution and pornography.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;or that law-abiding citizens will adopt criminal methods
</EM><BR>
<P>Transparency is not a evolutionary stable strategy, it is inherently unstable,
<BR>
so discussing its merits is like talking about if it would be fun to live in a world
<BR>
where the second law of thermodynamics worked backward. It's not going to happen.
<BR>
<P>If nobody in the world has secrets except me, that means I know all about the
<BR>
marketing plans and product development of your company but you know nothing
<BR>
about mine, that gives my company an advantage, it will grow and so will the
<BR>
privacy meme. On the other hand, if I tell all and have no secrets but
<BR>
everybody else has secrets, then it is my company will be at a disadvantage
<BR>
and shrink, and so will the transparency meme.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;If you don't mind  living as a criminal I don't mind letting you do it.  But you
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;will get no sympathy from me when you are caught and punished.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's ironic, you're telling everybody about the evils of privacy but I'll bet it
<BR>
doesn't say Mr. Zero Powers on your drivers license. As for me, I see
<BR>
nothing wrong with anonymity but I've given you my real name anyway.
