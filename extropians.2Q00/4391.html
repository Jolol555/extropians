<EM>&gt; Privatize the roads!  Make all transit user-pays.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In New York City, for example, the subways orginated because they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a good idea, and they were originally run by (competing) private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies.  The NYC subway system is still the most economical subway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system in the world, with user fares paying for over 75 cents on every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dollar spent on the system by the government.  I believe that if run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by a private company, the NYC subway would be cleaner, profitable and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a viable business again.  But just as the subway needs to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privatized, so must the roads.  After all, do long-haul commuters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really pay their fair share of the road costs?  (To tell you the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; truth, I don't know the answer, but I suspect that the federal and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state governments end up subsidizing driving, at least for certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drivers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Gas taxes pay for far more than just the roads and bridges. Gas tax money goes
<BR>
into biking and walking trails, mass transit construction, and lots of other
<BR>
non-transportation related things that have a higher priority than maintaining
<BR>
the road infrastructure.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's no good to say that private mass transit can work if you make the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highways a tax-funded pork barrel, too.  Let free enterprise solve the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately, transit at present is a massively government-meddled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with field.
</EM><BR>
<P>City government is essentially a monopoly corporation created to keep the
<BR>
streets of the city safe, clean, and maintained. If people insist on living in
<BR>
cities, some sort of a monopoly corporation is considered to be required, though
<BR>
I imagine that there is the possibility that residents of a street or block
<BR>
could form a 'street association' or 'block association' which would have
<BR>
contractual agreements with neighboring associations to share the cost of
<BR>
maintaining the streets they share, though you may wind up with some wildly
<BR>
variable streets. Sort of like the 'adopt a highway' program writ large.
<BR>
<P>Of course, a suburb association ringing a city could essentially lay seige to
<BR>
the city, blockading supplies to the city, and take control of the government of
<BR>
that city (just as eight blocks around one block could get together and lay
<BR>
seige to that block..)
