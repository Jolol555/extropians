<P>Sarah, if you are young, the cost of term life insurance (for say 10 years)
<BR>
is *very* cheap, probably a few $ a month.  Well worth investigating
<BR>
as a cryonics &quot;safety-net&quot; until you are earning money.  The question
<BR>
to ask yourself is whether your life is worth one or two movies a month?

</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Has anyone else on the list thought about this question? As things stand,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the absence of a 'perfect' freezing/revival mechanism, I cannot see any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason not to carry a donor card. This position is presumably supported by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all those who have opted for head-only cryonic suspension.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've thought quite a bit about this, and am not in favor of these options.
<BR>
Supporting the organ donor process as it exists today, IMO, raises
<BR>
several potential concerns.
<BR>
<P>Many people go for the head-only suspension (assuming they are going to
<BR>
get new organs as you suggest).  I do not like that option.  The reason is
<BR>
that to reconnect a spinal cord to a body is going to require a *lot* of
<BR>
neural crosswiring and/or mental retraining to move various body parts,
<BR>
get feedback from the right nerves back to the brain, etc.  Organ regrowth
<BR>
is probably going to be *easy* compared with the brain-body rewiring
<BR>
of muscles and senses headache.  Think of what happens if they get
<BR>
your index fingers connected to those brain areas responsible for sensing
<BR>
pleasurable genital stimulations...  &quot;I'm sorry officer, I can't sign
<BR>
that ticket because every time I do that I have an orgasm, I'm sure
<BR>
you understand...&quot;
<BR>
<P>The second problem I see with supporting &quot;natural&quot; organ donation is
<BR>
that it potentially serves as a disincentive for the scientific
<BR>
breakthroughs needed to grow real live new replacement organs from
<BR>
your own stem cells.  If the current need for organs were met (say by
<BR>
mandatory organ donation policies), then there would be a much
<BR>
lower return-on-investment for people who want to develp lab-grown
<BR>
or pig-grown organs.
<BR>
<P>The third and most significant problem is that if &quot;natural&quot; organ
<BR>
donation were to become a relatively inexpensive surgury and the
<BR>
rejection problems were to be overcome, that would provide the
<BR>
&quot;donor promoter&quot; organizations with more ammunition for *mandatory*
<BR>
organ donations, meaning cryonics patients would not have the option
<BR>
of avoiding the tangled neuron connection mess outlined above.
<BR>
If you are going to have *mandated* organ donations, then the estate
<BR>
(or frozen head) of the patient should be compensated for that (since
<BR>
presumably you aren't *really* dead yet) as while you are, &quot;on ice&quot;
<BR>
so to speak, someone has borrowed the use of your organs.  When
<BR>
you are reanimated, can you request that they be returned?  Perhaps
<BR>
with interest?
<BR>
