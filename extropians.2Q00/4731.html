<P><EM>&gt; Have you installed any recent releases of the major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distributions? Mandrake typically installs complete with fully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functional XF86 and a large collection of apps in about half the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time of a typical win9x installation, and with only a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reboot at the end of the process.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've heard good things about Mandrake - I last installed SuSE and Redhat
<BR>
about 4 months ago - and ran into snags...
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This, in itself, doesn't make Linux superior. But it does shoot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; holes in the ease-of-installation claims of Windows superiority.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Such claims never meant much anyway, even back when it was true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Casual users almost never install their own OS, and technical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; users aren't much bothered by a little extra installation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complexity as long as there are other compelling reasons to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an OS.
</EM><BR>
<P>My installation point was just a lead into the complexities faced in using
<BR>
and maintaining an open source system.  These complexities do not present a
<BR>
viable option for most consumers, who wouldn't understand the difference
<BR>
between alternate OS builds, shells, etc...  ...no matter how many times you
<BR>
attempted to explain these concepts.  When I consider the argument that
<BR>
open-source OSs are excellent for novices, I try to imagine my mother
<BR>
recompiling her kernel, then I laugh...
<BR>
<P>Anyway, we're way off topic here.  I'll withdraw any antagonistic statements
<BR>
I've made.  I only wish that we, as a population, could look more
<BR>
objectively upon the MS situation...
