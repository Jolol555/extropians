<EM>&gt;  Those may be elements of an extropian, but alone they do not make an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  extropian. By definition an extropian is an individual that adheres
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to the extropian principles
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Brian,
<BR>
I agree, one line posts probably are a waste of time. I shouldn't have 
<BR>
quipped at you, but I thought your &quot;real extropian&quot; post was so silly! Ok, 
<BR>
point taken, I apologize...
<BR>
But  replying to it with another one liner, and then replying again the same 
<BR>
day to the very thread you deemed worthless? Making worse of a mess, I'd say. 
<BR>
I am dropping it after this. 
<BR>
<P>But I did have a point. Separating out &quot;Real&quot; Extropians is saying others are 
<BR>
false. Which is not really the correct outlook. We are commited to this in 
<BR>
different levels and among us there are many differing views about Max's 
<BR>
writings, singularity and  transhumanism. 
<BR>
<P>His words are not, nor ever were intended to be doctrine, as far as I know. 
<BR>
Nor is he propunding a rigid adherance to these principles, at least not 
<BR>
anywhere I can find in his literature. 
<BR>
In fact... correct me if i am wrong...  I think I remember the principles 
<BR>
being slightly maleable themselves, and undergoing a revision (some while 
<BR>
ago).
<BR>
<P>My knowledge of him is that his is an extremely flexible and fluid mind, 
<BR>
which eschews dogma and creed. 
<BR>
<P>However, if you are right, and we must adhere to these principles, I guess I 
<BR>
am not a REAL extropian, because I don't adhere well to pre-set ideologies. I 
<BR>
am not stuck to anything. I change. I am not glued to this. I am many things, 
<BR>
one of them a futurist and an optimist. I call myself Extropian, and find 
<BR>
great inspiration in it's meaning, and yet I am not using the whole thing, 
<BR>
hook line and sinker. Yet it seems you would not allow me this title. 
<BR>
<P>To me, Bonnie is just fine as she is, and it isn't up to you to correct her, 
<BR>
unless she asks you to. (And now she has (!) and she earned big bonus points 
<BR>
of respect from me for doing so, what a lady! What a sweetheart.)
<BR>
<P>I took your post to Bonnie offensively, because I really DON'T like people to 
<BR>
tell me, or anyone else, &quot;go back, read the principles - you're not doing 
<BR>
this right&quot; - (or) you're not a real extropian unless you__________(Fill in 
<BR>
the blank).  
<BR>
<P><P>I have a hard time swallowing that kind of thing.  I have heard it again and 
<BR>
again.
<BR>
<P>I am what I am, I think for myself, and if I choose to call myself an 
<BR>
Extropian, even though I may totally disagree with certain aspects, then so 
<BR>
be it. 
<BR>
<P>Love, 
<BR>
Martha S. Muse
