<P>
Along those lines, here's a quote from Eric Hoffer's _The True Believer_:
<BR>
<P>&quot;It is easy to see how the faultfinding man of words, by persistent ridicule
<BR>
and denunciation, shakes prevailing beliefs and loyalties, and familiarizes
<BR>
the masses with the idea of change.  What is not so obvious is the process
<BR>
by which the discrediting of existing beliefs and institutions makes
<BR>
possible the rise of a new fanatical faith...A wide diffusion of doubt and
<BR>
irreverence...leads often to unexpected results.  The irreverence of the
<BR>
Renaissance was a prelude to the new fanaticism of Reformation and Counter
<BR>
Reformation...When we debunk a fanatical faith or prejudice, we do not
<BR>
strike at the root of fanaticism.  We merely prevent its leaking out at a
<BR>
certain point, with the likely result that it will leak out at some other
<BR>
point.  Thus by denigrating prevailing beliefs and loyalties, the militant
<BR>
man of words unwittingly creates in the disillusioned masses a hunger for
<BR>
faith.  For the majority of people cannot endure the barrenness and futility
<BR>
of their lives unless they have some ardent dedication, or some passionate
<BR>
pursuit in which they can lose themselves.&quot;
<BR>
<P>We were talking a bit on this list about human nature recently and of traits
<BR>
which served well in tribal times but which might not be so useful now or in
<BR>
the future, but we haven't talked about the need for a leader that seems to
<BR>
be present more often than not in the human psyche.  I expect this topic has
<BR>
been discussed on the list before, but if old-timers wouldn't mind covering
<BR>
old territory, it would be interesting to talk about it.
<BR>
<P>I would like to discuss the following three types of personalities:
<BR>
followers, leaders, and independent thinkers.
<BR>
<P>At some point in the future, people will have the ability to engineer the
<BR>
personalities of members of the succeeding generations.  If you were, say,
<BR>
creating the members of an expedition that would colonize a new planet, how
<BR>
would you handle the independent thinking vs. &quot;true believer&quot; trait?
<BR>
<P>What is the difference between a tribal leader and a political leader, with
<BR>
respect to personality?  I'm assuming here that a tribal leader does not use
<BR>
force to get people to follow her but is followed voluntarily, and only so
<BR>
long as her leadership is beneficialy to the other members of the tribe.  A
<BR>
political leader, by definition, uses coercion.
<BR>
<P>Would it be better to have a group of independent thinkers (who could, for
<BR>
example, figure out how to best utilize the resources of the new planet), or
<BR>
would it be better to have just one or two independent thinkers and the rest
<BR>
followers and leaders (presumably only a couple of leaders and the rest
<BR>
followers)?  In nomadic tribal cultures leaders generally have the same
<BR>
material possessions as followers and do the same sorts of work as far as
<BR>
gathering and hunting food.  Thus, there would be less reason for a follower
<BR>
to resent his or her role as follower than in a more complex culture where
<BR>
the leader has a better house, better clothes, etc.
<BR>
<P>In the hypothetical planet colonizing expedition, would the people
<BR>
engineered to be followers resent the sort of roles they'd been genetically
<BR>
assigned to?
<BR>
<P>In a civilization rich with the fruits of nanotechnology, would leaders
<BR>
enjoy any special privileges? If the option existed for a person who had
<BR>
been born and educated to be a follower to be re-engineered into a leader,
<BR>
would many followers choose this option? What of independent thinkers?
<BR>
Would they want to change?  Would followers and/or leaders have any
<BR>
incentive to become independent thinkers?
<BR>
<P>To what extent do people living at this very moment have the ability to
<BR>
change from followers to independent thinkers?  How about the other way
<BR>
around?  From independent thinkers to followers? What incentives are there
<BR>
to change from one to the other?
<BR>
<P>These are a few of the questions that are on my mind this morning as I
<BR>
prepare to go out to my garden.

<EM>&gt; A Christian is afraid you'll go to Hell. An atheist is afraid you'll make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hell on Earth to save him from the Hell that doesn't exist. Try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reading &quot;A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Skeleton in God's Closet&quot;, although it may be hard to find (I borrowed it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from my church). The crux of the book is that an incredibly talented and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obsessed atheist engineers evidence proving Jesus was not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resurrected. His
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; motivation was to destroy religion because it was holding back humanity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (ironically the suicides he wound up creating were incalcuable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and when he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was exposed the Church was almost entirely vindicated and achieved a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; popularity rivalling the martyrdom of early Christendom).
