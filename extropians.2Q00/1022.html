<EM>&gt; If you think it's that easy, do it.  Nice of you to just cast aside an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organization with thousands of members and 20 years experience.  The party
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not the incompetent little startup it was 20 years ago; it is now an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experienced, capable, political machine fighting an uphill battle.

<P>The Christian church has had a bit under 2000 years' experience, and
<BR>
other religions have has similarly long experience, in defining reality
<BR>
and moral law.  Yet we gladly cast them all aside where we see that they
<BR>
err, or where we discover better alternatives.
<BR>
<P>NASA has had 40+ years' experience in doing space missions.  Yet the
<BR>
debates on this list is that they are screwing up big time, and a few
<BR>
suggest that NASA should be disbanded or privatized so that the
<BR>
experienced instituation can get out of the way of those who might
<BR>
actually do the job right.
<BR>
<P>Craftsmen for several millenia pounded out common implements by hand,
<BR>
yet it might have been technically possible for a late-Roman-era
<BR>
blacksmith to set up steam-powered sword manufacturing machines rather
<BR>
than spending so much time in making each individual sword, if they had
<BR>
thought of it.  The laws of physics and economics were the same then as
<BR>
they are now, even if not as well known.
<BR>
<P>The United States Postal Service has over a century of experience in
<BR>
delivering letters and other physical goods.  They are not most peoples'
<BR>
first choice for a package delivery organization in the US today, losing
<BR>
out to younger competitors like FedEx and UPS, though some people still
<BR>
use them (especially for letters or PO box service).
<BR>
<P>Just because a person or a group has been doing something for a while
<BR>
does not necessarily mean it knows how to do that thing effectively.
<BR>
Besides, both the Democrats and the Republicans have more than 20 years'
<BR>
experience.
