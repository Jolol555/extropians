<P>
In the chart you link to, the bonds are long term and were subject to more
<BR>
years of inflation than deflation during the years covered.  This would not
<BR>
be the case with the strategy I suggested of buying only short term bonds.
<BR>
I agree that T-bills are not a good investment for the long term.
<BR>
<P>As the standard deviations for the 3 asset classes indicate, stock returns
<BR>
are far more volatile than returns on bonds.  If you take a smaller
<BR>
assortment of stocks, which is what most people end up with, the volatility
<BR>
will be even greater.  Most people, if they purchase stocks for their own
<BR>
portfolios, can't afford to diversify widely, and mutual fund managers don't
<BR>
seem to have all that good of a track record. Some volatility wouldn't hurt
<BR>
if you were prepared to hang on for the long term, it's true.  And a person
<BR>
could transfer their money out of stocks and into bonds at retirement age
<BR>
when they want to withdraw money periodically. But what if a person reached
<BR>
retirement age just as the market went into a slump of several years'
<BR>
duration? Also, some of the volatility which appears negligible on a chart
<BR>
translates into rather severe losses for the individual investor.
<BR>
<P>Your info comes closer to changing my mind than other stuff I've seen, Rob,
<BR>
but I'd still feel queasy advising someone to put their life savings into
<BR>
the stockmarket.

Subject: Investing (long term returns)
<BR>
<P><P>See, for example, <A HREF="http://www.dljdirect.com/hti_t01.htm">http://www.dljdirect.com/hti_t01.htm</A> , for a quick
<BR>
table comparing inflation-adjusted returns for various asset classes.
<BR>
<P>Over the long run, stock strategies such as buying the S&amp;P 500 index
<BR>
whomp investments in either bonds or short-term instruments, or cash,
<BR>
adjusted for inflation.
<BR>
<P>There are perhaps reasons why one might choose not to invest in US stocks,
<BR>
but over the long haul, net net returns and inflation resistance aren't
<BR>
among
<BR>
them.  Short term instruments (T-bills, commercial paper, cash) are
<BR>
particularly poor investments over the long term, even during inflationary
<BR>
periods [though less so then long-term debt during the same period if you
<BR>
need to trade the bonds during the bout of inflation]).
<BR>
<P>These market behaviors  are USA-specific.  I don't know of any comparable
<BR>
measures for non-USA investment environments but I'm sure they could be dug
<BR>
up.  Financial markets outside the USA have historically tended to be more
<BR>
volatile (risky) for various reasons, such as lower liquidity, increased
<BR>
political risk, and others.
<BR>
<P>Of course, dissenting views exist. See, for example,
<BR>

<BR>
friend)

Disclaimer: I work for a Wall Street firm in asset management (but on
<BR>
systems,
<BR>
not sales!)
