Perhaps I wasn't clear.  [Need more coffee...]

<EM>&gt; &gt; Some questions related to this would be:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (a) What are the (energy/entropy) costs of destroying information in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     the real world vs. the virtual world?  [Reversible computing is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     going to produce the densest computing but it does so at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     expense of minimizing the erasing bits.]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Uh, Robert, a bit is a bit. The storage and manipulation constraints are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly the same no matter what the bit is used for.
</EM><BR>
<P>The work by Bennett, Landauer, etc. say the &quot;cost&quot; in computing is
<BR>
the cost of erasing information.  For example, if I have a capacitor
<BR>
storing some electrons, there is a heat produced in removing those
<BR>
electrons to discharge the capacitor.  They way you reduce this problem
<BR>
is to allow the capacitor to charge and discharge very slowly (along the
<BR>
ideas of reversible computing).  However in a virtual world it isn't
<BR>
clear to me that those constraints exist.  If you have the freedom
<BR>
to design the ecology, could there be a way that allows the
<BR>
virtual erasure of some information to result in the virtual
<BR>
creation of other information (along the lines of allowing
<BR>
the electrons to cycle between two capacitors).  You have
<BR>
to design the system so that the transforms on the information
<BR>
waste less energy than similar transforms using &quot;real&quot; atoms
<BR>
or molecules.  For example -- can I design a virtual system
<BR>
where the energy cost of breaking a virtual C=C bond is cheaper
<BR>
than the energy cost of breaking a real C=C bond (~1.19 aJ)?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (b) Is the real world less expensive than the virtual world for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &quot;storing&quot; an arbitrary amount of information?  [It seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     me that a virtual world based on storage in photons should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     be cheaper than a real world based on storage in atoms.]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can't store information in a virtual world at all. Any information that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appears to be stored there must actually be represented in some physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory device in the real world. Which means you always come back to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constraints of physical-layer devices.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but there are many examples, say from mathematics, where a simple
<BR>
formula can represent a huge amount of information.  Moravec's article
<BR>
points out how optimizing compilers can transform one representation
<BR>
of a process into a much more efficient representation.  The Transmeta
<BR>
efforts show how you can design a machine that can refine processes
<BR>
into increasingly efficient operations.
<BR>
<P>I agree there always has to be a physical representation.  But almost
<BR>
all &quot;information&quot; in the current &quot;real&quot; world is represented in atoms,
<BR>
atomic bonds, electric charges in specific locations, etc.  I'm thinking
<BR>
along the lines of a &quot;virtual&quot; computer where the information is
<BR>
represented by photons at specific positions in space.  It seems
<BR>
likely that a computer of that type (i.e. no matter, other than that
<BR>
required to produce the photons), could potentially have a much higher
<BR>
information density than &quot;matter&quot; based computers or Moravec's
<BR>
Higgsinium or Monopolium (that are still based on &quot;atomic&quot; models).
