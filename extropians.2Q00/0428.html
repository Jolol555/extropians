Last night, I was watching Nightline. The subject was the breaking news that
<BR>
Janet Reno had approved Elian's return. She was a guest via satellite.
<BR>
Locals from Miami were in attendance and were invited to speak up. A man
<BR>
stood up, and made statements directed towards Reno, implying that she was
<BR>
guilty of actions involved in Wacco that led to many deaths, and asked why
<BR>
now, she should be given the authority over a sensitive case such as
<BR>
Elian's. It was obvious that Dan Rather, was not fond of these comments,
<BR>
turned off the guys mic, and assured Reno, that the rest of the people in
<BR>
the audience supported her, and did not feel the same. (how does he know
<BR>
that, I wondered?) I was some what appaled at the censorship interjected
<BR>
into an apparent free speech environment. They did not allow the man to
<BR>
continue, and Rather poked fun at his insitent questioning regarding Wacco.
<BR>
Although the format was directed towards Elian, I see no reason why one can
<BR>
not connect the dots and inquire as to his opinion.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I would cut the gordian knot by first granting citizenship to Elian and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;posthumously to his mother in honor of her sacrifice and Elian's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffering.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I would then rule that primary custody still belongs with the father,
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;that Elian should return to Cuba with the father, under the provision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;the Cuban government accept that Elian is free to return to the US when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;reaches the age of majority if he so wishes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe that the congress is planning to offer citizenship to Elian and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his father.  With full rights of being American citizens, does the father
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the right to return back to Cuba with his son?  The assumption always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems to be that nobody would want to go back if they didn't have to.
</EM><BR>
What
<BR>
<EM>&gt; if the father is given a full range of legal options, and still choses to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take his family back to Cuba?  Would that be acceptable to the people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wanting to keep Elian here?
