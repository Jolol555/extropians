Well, if Roboto minds are developable in a massively, intelligent and 
<BR>
super-capable sense over the eons, does that preclude emotion?  I sure hope 
<BR>
not. Emotions are fun. Even the negative ones, I wouldnt want to give up, 
<BR>
but I dont think we would need to.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Emotions can be fun, but they can be a nightmare too.  I will say that 
<BR>
negative emotions have their place to guide and warn us about situations if 
<BR>
we can look at them somewhat objectively and not be blinded.

Those of you who have been madly in love will find this easy to understand: 
<BR>
wouldnt it be cool to take *that* emotion and pump it up several orders of 
<BR>
magnitude? {8-]
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Being in love is already such an overwhelming experience!  And to not have 
<BR>
that love returned while sensing it never will, is to be in a mental state 
<BR>
of PURE HELL.  To be in agony over a failed romantic venture, and have 
<BR>
medication to greatly lessen the emotional pain(not alcohol!) would be a 
<BR>
boon for humanity.  For some it takes many months or even years to get over 
<BR>
heartbreak, and some individuals never truly get over it.  The emotional 
<BR>
agony of heartbreak can interfere will all the other areas of that persons 
<BR>
life.

I think that some of Eliezer's work on how to define motivational agendas 
<BR>
and goal oriented selection vs. simple &quot;emotions&quot; may provide a path out of 
<BR>
this pit. But Spike's comments (no offense Spike!)provide an example of 
<BR>
exactly how difficult it will be for people to consider how to self-evolve 
<BR>
themselves to a level undictated by millions of years of evolution of 
<BR>
selfish genes.

<P>I like the scenario painted by David Pearce of the Hedonics Imperative 
<BR>
website.  A world where we are not &quot;blissed out constantly&quot; in a &quot;soma 
<BR>
stupor&quot; but have brains engineered for generally a very happy, content and 
<BR>
yet ambitious state of being that is not so ruled by jealousy, negativity 
<BR>
and depression.
<BR>
<P>I would be curious to see how 'transhumans' a century from now do their 
<BR>
dating, rating and mating!  I am sure it will still be an intense human 
<BR>
interaction but I would like to think it will not have the unfairness of the 
<BR>
present world(did you get a good characteristics score when the genetic dice 
<BR>
were rolled for you?) where unfairly handed out physical looks(and brains) 
<BR>
count for so much.
<BR>
<P>I want a much more fair world then now, though I realize it will never be 
<BR>
totally fair.  Most likely, a genetic &quot;arms race&quot; or case of &quot;class warfare&quot; 
<BR>
will be happening, where the very wealthy get the best modifications for 
<BR>
their offspring to outclass others born to parents of lower financial power.
<BR>
<P>I hope they will have brains that have been neurohacked to the point where 
<BR>
they can much better control their emotional pain levels, but yet not &quot;lock 
<BR>
their hearts&quot; to the extent that they no longer feel strong want and 
<BR>
romantic stirrings.
<BR>
<P>In our present state it is so easy to be &quot;taken over&quot; by negative emotions 
<BR>
that can bring us down for recurring long periods.  Even the most 
<BR>
intelligent people can be vulnerable to this.  Somehow this has to be 
<BR>
stopped somehow.
<BR>
<P>I admit, in some ways I like how we are made up.  I like the idea that I 
<BR>
have a natural born desire to seek out a female mate and raise children.  
<BR>
But the struggle to find one attractive enough for me, that I can be 
<BR>
compatible with(and will accept me and my imperfections) is tiring and very 
<BR>
frustrating at times.  The very despair I feel over this actually damages my 
<BR>
odds of success in his nature-driven goal of mine.
<BR>

<BR>
