Another message that Garret asked me to forward (he's using the drip-drip
<BR>
method it seems). The conference site is at

The Foresight Institute Europe fields a speaker for TVMM
<BR>
<P>Phillippe Van Nedevelde, director of Foresight Europe has agreed to speak at
<BR>
the TVMM conference this July.
<BR>
Phillippe will be letting us know what the Institute is doing in Europe, and
<BR>
also he will be giving a run down on UP! which, he says, &quot;is The first
<BR>
thoroughbred transhumanist entrepreneurial initiative&quot;. The (so-called)
<BR>
internet revolution has made many new millionaires, and quite a few
<BR>
billionaires, and all it does is shift around bits, imagine what being able
<BR>
to shift around atoms in the same way will do.
<BR>
If we don't have at least one neophyte start-up company by the Sunday
<BR>
evening we should hang our heads in shame.
