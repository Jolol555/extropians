<EM>&gt; &gt; anything that would increase the likelihood of cancer occurring in the

<EM>&gt; &gt; cells not decrease it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;John, has pointed out the points in my argument that I'm glossing over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The question is: What are the sources of mutation that lead to malignancy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(and perhaps aspects of aging)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(a) Radiation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(b) Oxidative stress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(c) Toxins in the cellular &quot;environment&quot; (derived from food).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(d) Mutations by DNA Polymerase in copying the DNA.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now, look at the difference between replication in the laboratory dish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where you are pushing the cells as fast as possible (about 1 generation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;per day) in &quot;perfect&quot; culture media, with much lower exposure to toxins
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a very uniform level of oxygen (so you can tune the antioxidant defenses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and/or repair rates appropriately) and a much reduced level of radiation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;esposure simply due to a shorter time period.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It is well known that DNA damage &quot;cleanup&quot; is supposed to occur during
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;both transcription and DNA replication.  This is however imperfect and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certain types of damage result in repairs that must cause mutations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(otherwise *where* would they come from?).
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm trying to recall the work I saw covered in Scientific American a few 
<BR>
years back relating chaos theory to cell aging....  O'well.  Maybe it will 
<BR>
come to me later.  Anyway, there are other systemic causes for &quot;mutation&quot; 
<BR>
that are usually not mentioned simply because we don't understand them yet 
<BR>
in a way that easilly lends itself to quantitative experiments.
<BR>
<P>For example, considering the DNA/RNA machinery as a kind of computer, there 
<BR>
are certain sets of instructions that are considered valid and others that 
<BR>
will be treated as nonsense.  However, programmers only have so much time 
<BR>
and energy to devote to finding bugs and hidden weaknesses in code, and 
<BR>
companies must balance that expense against the needs of competition.  These 
<BR>
factors can easilly be translated into system constraints that must also 
<BR>
apply to cell DNA/RNA programming.
<BR>
<P>Thus, the engineering tradeoffs dictate that in a system as complex as a 
<BR>
cell, there WILL be bugs and weaknesses, but that they can't be prevalent or 
<BR>
serious enough that most cells will succumb to them much of the time.  Part 
<BR>
of the information that serves as input to the cell is from the surrounding 
<BR>
chemical and probably electrical environment.  Cells have the capacity to 
<BR>
alter themselves into variants on the main program as the situation 
<BR>
dictates.  Statistically, there is the tiny chance that one of the lethal 
<BR>
variants of the signals will get through.
<BR>
<P>However, as I'm vaguely recalling from the Sci. Am. article, cells also tend 
<BR>
to go crazy when pushed somehow outside the normal operating parameters.
<BR>
<P>Koestler wrote about the DNA code being taped over - as with a piano with 
<BR>
certain keys taped over - such that only certain potentialities are 
<BR>
expressed.  As cells age, however, they tend to drift back toward a more 
<BR>
general expression - to become less differentiated, as the &quot;tape&quot; comes 
<BR>
loose at random points, until they conclude that somehow they are not 
<BR>
fulfilling their mission - or the demented version of it that now is the 
<BR>
controlling goal.
<BR>
<P>When cells conclude that they are not fulfilling their mission - or, more 
<BR>
concretely, when signals from the cell surround indicate that it is not 
<BR>
capable of meeting its programmed challenges, what is the response going to 
<BR>
be?   ...  To divide, obviously.  If one cell is not enough, then maybe a 
<BR>
million will do the trick.
<BR>
<P>This is what cells do normally all the time, dictated by demand.  But when 
<BR>
the cell has lost its way and is pursueing some demented purpose based on 
<BR>
mutations or simply the improper access to code that is supposed to be 
<BR>
dormant - like the telomerase gene - then no number of divisions will 
<BR>
suffice to yield a satisfactory return signal.  This, we call a tumor.  The 
<BR>
tumor will normally succumb when its telomeres shorten to much, but if it 
<BR>
also manages to access the telomerase gene, then the whole system is in 
<BR>
trouble.
<BR>
<P>So, what kinds of code correction systems keep these cells in line well 
<BR>
beyond the normal limits, as we have been discussing?
<BR>
<P>Is it possible that one of the reasons for the apparent extended 
<BR>
youthfulness, etc., exhibited in the recent calve clones or some of the cell 
<BR>
culture experiments is due to the fact that the stable environment, with 
<BR>
only cells of the same kind present, made for a much stronger reinforcement 
<BR>
signal pattern to the cells of each generation?  Instead of the chance of 
<BR>
stray signals from surrounding tissue or debris or viruses, etc., confusing 
<BR>
the cell as to its identity and slipping through one of the programming 
<BR>
holes, each newly divided heart muscle cell received the unambiguous 
<BR>
message, &quot;you're a heart muscle cell...  you're a heart muscle cell...  
<BR>
you're a heart muscle cell...  &quot;
<BR>
<P>Thus, the normal correction procedures that keep a cell on track might use 
<BR>
that unambiguous signal as a referent, and actually clean up a lot of 
<BR>
accumulated error.
