<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; I was referring to the location of the brain, not the consciousness.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why? Who cares about that?
<BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;&gt;I've been making and destroying a billion Harvey Newstroms every second
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;&gt;since  you were a one celled zygote, so you tell me, who is the original Harvey
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;&gt;Newstrom?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;The thing that you copy *from* is the original.  The thing you copy *to* is
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;not the original.
</EM><BR>
<P>I see, well that's all very nice but I do have just one question, who is the original
<BR>
Harvey Newstrom?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; I have pointed out many fallacies in your logic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Strange, I can't recall you doing that.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;You redefine terms  half-way through an example.
</EM><BR>
<P>Name one.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;You claim to make a second and third copy, and  then later claim that
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;there is only &quot;one&quot; copy.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was talking about second and third copies of bodies having the same
<BR>
consciousness, but of course you already knew that. I detect desperation
<BR>
on your part, and that's consistent with your readily apparent rising anger.
<BR>
I've found that people rarely get angry when they're winning an argument.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;If you create a body and destroy it so fast that it doesn't have time
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;to have a single thought, then you have failed to recreate my
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;consciousness in a copy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. That was exactly my point, the fate of the copy can not be the entire
<BR>
story because you, the sum total of all the trillions of copies, is alive and
<BR>
conscious.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;You have changed the definition of the copy from being a functional
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;mind copy to a nonfunctional body copy.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've done nothing of the sort, all I did was start talking about a different thought
<BR>
experiment. I didn't realize that was illegal.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;It's a fruit!
</EM><BR>
<P>Fruit grows on trees, tomatoes grow on vines.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;If you try to  ignore the atoms and energy, and just try to have &quot;redness&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;exist by itself without any reliance on the real world, you are defining a
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;mystical soul.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nonsense. Redness is not light waves, if I sit in a dark room and put a little
<BR>
pressure on my eyeball I can see red flashes. I don't even need to do that,
<BR>
I can just remember what redness looks like. Beethoven's ninth symphony
<BR>
is not air pressure graph either, it's a brain state.
