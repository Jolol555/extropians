<EM>&gt;  &gt; No, no, no...this won't do at all.  While it is true that a claymore will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; frag any thief out to 100 meters or so in the operating direction (&quot;This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; side facing enemy&quot;), it also has a tendency to obliterate everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; within about 15 meters in every direction.  This can't possibly be a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; thing for your car.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But a price of a car is little price to pay for permanently removing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that particular agent from possible interactions in your personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about multiple-use? Active armor, for instance?

<P>Trouble is, carjackers have a bad habit of capping slow-reacting
<BR>
victims, or of taking female victims along for rape &amp; murder.  Stopping
<BR>
them at the door is a Good Thing.  The first torch unit used in the US
<BR>
would land the user in jail, alas.  Maybe if it followed the flames with
<BR>
a halon spray to put the perp out before letting him get totally
<BR>
toasted... but the prosecutors would probably still label it first
<BR>
degree arson.
<BR>
<P>BTW, in my cab driving days I once had a belligerent passenger (standing
<BR>
behind the open left rear door) grab my left wrist as I reached back for
<BR>
the cash awkwardly offered from behind.  He started to lift a weapon in
<BR>
his right hand (I never did see exactly what it was), so I threw the
<BR>
gearshift in reverse and ran him over with the door.  If I'd thought
<BR>
just a bit faster I'd have cocked the wheel to my right to swing the
<BR>
front of the car over him, too.  Asshole.
