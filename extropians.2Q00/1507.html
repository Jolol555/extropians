<EM>&gt; &gt; Did he waive his right to a speedy trial?

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike Lorrey replies:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No, he didn't. Moreover, he was in jail for something like 3 years before he was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; even arraigned. They wouldn't let him have access to evidence, or participate in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; his defense, and he was refused access to simple electronic devices like phones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and calculators.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/mitnick.background/">http://cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/mitnick.background/</A> puts a little different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spin on this:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Mitnick's trial had been delayed several times due its complexity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    and often at the request of the defense.
</EM><BR>
<P>The prosecution repeated refused to give mitnick and his defense attorneys access to
<BR>
the evidence. Then they snowed them under with 10 gigabytes of data. Sound familiar?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; If the defense is requesting delays, that is not consistent with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demanding a speedy trial.  The defense doesn't get to drive the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process, setting the timetable which all parties must follow, for their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own convenience.  They can demand a speedy trial and then both sides are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handicapped by the rapidity of the proceedings.  But once the defense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starts requesting delays, the prosecution gets to do so as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>The defense kept requesting delays because the prosecution kept refusing to cooperate
<BR>
on releasing evidence, and kept refusing to allow Mitnick to access the evidence. 10
<BR>
gigabytes printed up is a huge amount of information. The prison warden wouldn't let
<BR>
him have enough room to review that evidence in printed form, and it wouldn't fit in
<BR>
his cell. So he was denied access to evidence. The warden refused to allow him to
<BR>
posess any printed material that outlined electronic circuits, or to posess typed text
<BR>
source code. The prosecution delayed for the first two years giving any evidentiary
<BR>
access, because what they had was bogus. The prosecution claimed Mitnick caused over
<BR>
$4 million in damages. In the end they could only prove $4,000.00 in damages.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    Randolph tried repeatedly to get Mitnick a computer so he could review
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    evidence that reportedly includes witness statements totaling 1,400
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    pages, 10 gigabytes of electronic evidence and 1,700 exhibits in all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    But after one hearing, Randolph told reporters that Judge Pfaelzer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    &quot;didn't seem to want to hear 'computer' and 'Mitnick' in the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    sentence.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The court ultimately allowed Mitnick access to a laptop, but it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    in a room for attorney-client meetings, and he was always monitored by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    someone from Randolph's office. And there was no modem or phone line.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So it wasn't that he was denied access to evidence, he was denied access
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to computers.  From what I read here it implies that if his lawyer had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply printed out the relevant data on paper and carried it in, Mitnick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could do whatever he wanted with it.  But the lawyer wasn't allowed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bring in a computer until late in the proceedings.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you think you could read 10 gigabytes of text in its entirety and remember it all,
<BR>
enough to be used in your defense? I don't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    In the meanwhile, Mitnick has been serving out a 14-month sentence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for violating his probation in the Digital break-in and eight months
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for a 1995 North Carolina charge of possession of an unauthorized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    access device.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    &quot;Kevin's problem is that he has been convicted multiple times,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    said journalist Markoff. &quot;Whatever you think of his crime, he has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    tripped the relevant federal guidelines. And the judge gave him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    a break before. Now he's before her again for another series of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    federal crimes.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Markoff has repeatedly lied about this story, on at least five if not more occasions.
<BR>
Kevin Mitneck was never on anybody's 'most wanted' list, especially that of the FBI,
<BR>
contrary to the claims of Markoff and Shimomura in their book 'Cyberpunk'. The FBI has
<BR>
repeated denied that Kevin was ever anywhere near being put on their most wanted list.
<BR>
Markoff has also lied about the alleged damages done by Mitnick. He claims that
<BR>
Mitnick caused many millions of dollars of damages to The Well BBS and ISP service,
<BR>
which The Well has repeatedly denied. Markoff also denies that he had a pre-existing
<BR>
relationship with Mitnick, and that his stories in the New York Times and his book are
<BR>
merely part of a personal vandetta to destroy Mitnick's life.
<BR>
<P>One of the things that Mitnick was previously convicted of was posession of a Radio
<BR>
Shack speed dialer. This is the 'unauthorized access device' that Markoff speaks of.
<BR>
This is a device that anyone can buy for less than $10 at your local radio shack.
<BR>
Posession of it is not a crime. If the prosecution can prove that you happen to know
<BR>
how to alter one of these speed dialers with a $0.05 electronic component that will
<BR>
allow you to use certain types of payphones for free (that is also sold by Radio
<BR>
Shack, hmmmm see a pattern here? Why isn't Radio Shack up on charges of conspiracy?)
<BR>
then they can typically get a judge who knows nothing about electronics or telephony
<BR>
to convict you of intent or attempted unauthorized access of a communications network.
<BR>
<P>Markoff is currently under suit for libel and defamation by Mitnick. Markoff made
<BR>
millions of dollars for his book 'Cyberpunk' and its sequels making all sorts of
<BR>
outlandish claims about Mitnick, while the most that can be proved is that Mitnick
<BR>
caused at most $4,000 in damages. Markoff claims that Mitnick illegally accessed NORAD
<BR>
computers, and claims that Mitnick is the person that the character in the movie 'War
<BR>
Games' is based on (both have been proven to be lies by NORAD and the people who wrote
<BR>
'War Games').
<BR>
<P>Mitnick was arrested at age 17 for his first offense, and contrary to California Law,
<BR>
the LA Times published his name. As a result he was fired from every job he could get
<BR>
when they found out who he was. Just as a drug conviction for posession of a joint
<BR>
will destroy your life (even one planted there by a malicious girlfreind or police
<BR>
officer), Kevin's was destroyed by this unlawful public disclosure.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; He was denied bail, but he was a known flight risk.  He had been a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fugitive for three years until Shimomura caught him, and law enforcement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couldn't count on the assistance of a top rank computer security expert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to catch Mitnick next time.  So I can fully understand the denial of bail.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Plus it sounds like two years of his jail time was counted as working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off previous sentences.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok so what about the other 2.5 years of jail time before he actually got a trial?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Putting all this together, Mitnick has had a rough ride, but he has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brought it on himself.  He violated his probation and he fled from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; justice despite lenient treatment by the judges in his earlier arrests.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Under those conditions no one could not expect kind treatment from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criminal justice system.  At least some of his jail time was owed due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to previous convictions, and he himself requested delays in his trial.
</EM><BR>
<P>Delays requested because he and his lawyers were denied access to evidence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The judges may have been excessively paranoid in keeping Mitnick away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from phones and computers, but these are not technological people and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it was hard for them to know what harm Mitnick might accomplish with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access to this equipment.  And these limitations do not prevent Mitnick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from participating in his defense.  For hundreds of years prisoners have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gotten by without computers.
</EM><BR>
<P>What other prisoners had 10 gigabytes of evidence to sift through? What other
<BR>
non-violent offenders have ever been confined for that many years without trial? Name
<BR>
one person in the US criminal system who has ever spent 4.5 years in jail before the
<BR>
start of their trial. There is none.
