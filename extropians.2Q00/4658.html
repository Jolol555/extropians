<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I did have a point. Separating out &quot;Real&quot; Extropians is saying others are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; false. Which is not really the correct outlook. We are commited to this in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different levels and among us there are many differing views about Max's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writings, singularity and  transhumanism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed that there definitely different views and commitment levels. However
<BR>
as you can see below I think we can pretty easily say in many cases
<BR>
that someone is NOT an extropian. Now that doesn't mean that they shouldn't
<BR>
lurk and post here, or hang out, or whatever. And it definitely doesn't
<BR>
mean that they don't have some wonderful extropian qualities. But I
<BR>
think the ability to call oneself an extropian should be reserved for those
<BR>
individuals that truly have thought out and committed to the requirements
<BR>
and consequences of living with the principles.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; His words are not, nor ever were intended to be doctrine, as far as I know.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right, although as he says they define a specific &quot;brand&quot; of transhumanism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nor is he propunding a rigid adherance to these principles, at least not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anywhere I can find in his literature.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact... correct me if i am wrong...  I think I remember the principles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being slightly maleable themselves, and undergoing a revision (some while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ago).
</EM><BR>
<P>I think they are always under revision, yes. But they more or less define
<BR>
at any point in time what you agree with if you are seriously calling
<BR>
yourself an extropian. In my opinion.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My knowledge of him is that his is an extremely flexible and fluid mind,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which eschews dogma and creed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, if you are right, and we must adhere to these principles, I guess I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; am not a REAL extropian, because I don't adhere well to pre-set ideologies. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; am not stuck to anything. I change. I am not glued to this. I am many things,
</EM><BR>
<P>There are no &quot;rules&quot; that you can absolutely agree are correct, and live by?
<BR>
Interesting.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; one of them a futurist and an optimist. I call myself Extropian, and find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great inspiration in it's meaning, and yet I am not using the whole thing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hook line and sinker. Yet it seems you would not allow me this title.
</EM><BR>
<P>In skateboarder jargon I think you would be a poseur. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To me, Bonnie is just fine as she is, and it isn't up to you to correct her,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unless she asks you to. (And now she has (!) and she earned big bonus points
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of respect from me for doing so, what a lady! What a sweetheart.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I took your post to Bonnie offensively, because I really DON'T like people to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell me, or anyone else, &quot;go back, read the principles - you're not doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this right&quot; - (or) you're not a real extropian unless you__________(Fill in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the blank).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a hard time swallowing that kind of thing.  I have heard it again and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am what I am, I think for myself, and if I choose to call myself an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extropian, even though I may totally disagree with certain aspects, then so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well that's the real catch isn't it? I just don't see how you can logically
<BR>
say that simultaneously you disagree with certain parts of a philosophy
<BR>
yet still call yourself a member of it? Is that like calling yourself a
<BR>
catholic and then having an abortion when it suits you?
<BR>
<P>In my opinion if we don't reserve the noun Extropian for those who are
<BR>
full fledged practitioners of the philosophy, then isn't that a bit of
<BR>
an insult to those people?
