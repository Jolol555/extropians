Some states have public referendum laws or such are specified in the state
<BR>
constitution. There is no federal referendum process. Each state has its own
<BR>
requirements, requiring typically a couple thousand up to a as much as 5% of the
<BR>
electorate sometimes to get something on the ballot.
<BR>
<P>I play around at policy.com and opinion.com, and I email my federal legislators
<BR>
at least on a monthly basis, usually in opposition to some tyrannical law people
<BR>
in DC are trying to pass. I think that the way politicians treat polls and
<BR>
letters from constitutents is sort of an informal referendum process. The fact
<BR>
that a couple of them still remember when they nominated me to one or another
<BR>
military academy, and that I'm a voting veteran, helps make sure they pay
<BR>
attention.
<BR>
<P>I do find that local legislators, oddly enough, seem to fall through the cracks
<BR>
of public oversight. There are some that try to fly under the radar, so to
<BR>
speak. Nobody knows who they are or what they look like, they don't make public
<BR>
announcements or cause controversy, and usually run unopposed, or run opposed by
<BR>
people even less known than they are.
<BR>
<P>Some referendum systems only allow the public to vote on whether to submit the
<BR>
proposed law to the legislature, while others overrule the legislature, and can
<BR>
only be Vetoed by the Governor.

<EM>&gt; What is the mechanism so that citizens may introduce legislation into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the legislature?  I am aware there are mechanisms to get public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; referendums on ballots by gathering a certain quantity of validated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signatures of citizens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess what I am finding is a flaw in our representative democracy in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the representatives aren't representative of the interests of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who elected them, for lack of any better one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In this age of modern technology, we should use some of it to enable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cyber-grassroots mobilization.  What has come to mind is a web interface
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a wwide variety of proposed legislation, a clearinghouse for it, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it were.  Say that as a U.S. citizen you can write suggested legislation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on any of a variety of topics that are legislatable.  Then, legislation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is organized so that different topics and causes will have compromises
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hammered, or separate proposals if they are incompatible.  Then, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legislation is developed in this virtual town hall federally and for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each region, separately or as one, then as legislation passes through a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public peer-review process and reaches the point where credible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; volunteers vouch for its Consitutionality and value depending on other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merits, then the legislation is fast-tracked into the requisite forms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for each jurisdiction, ie, from electronic community, communication,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussion, review, and mobilization, then the real world requirements
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for placement in the processes of legislation are fulfilled, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; virtual communities' mobilization is used locally and extra-locally to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; satisfy any requirements, where some of the first legislation might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to enable electronic satisfaction of the requirements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As electronic signatures are now as valid as written signatures, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may be used to denote citzens' affirmation of some proposeed legislation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be considered for public referendum, or even to be de facto proposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as sponsored by the locale in regular legislature.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This leads to some other issues, for example, a citizen may choose to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develop a profile of his/her views that are shared or not,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incrementally, depending upon his preferences about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This might be seen as being about reforming the government, but moreso
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is about making the government (here in the U.S.) more as it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; designed to be more than two hundred years ago, representative of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizens.
