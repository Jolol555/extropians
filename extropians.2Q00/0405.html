<EM>&gt; &gt;From: Damien Broderick &lt;<A HREF="mailto:d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au?Subject=Re:%20e-publishing%20fiction&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.UW2.4.20.0004081432160.25016-100000@ilr&gt;">d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au</A>&gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There are two big holes in this plan:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;we don't have the gadgets to allow people to pay for a download.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think I can set this up, I've been thinking about doing it anyway
<BR>
for &quot;Xenology&quot;.  You just want a Java interface that lets someone
<BR>
invoke something like PayPal or a CC payment before they get a magic
<BR>
download key.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Might be best to talk to me off-line, to avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cluttering the list.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think there are enough potential authors on the list that it might
<BR>
be of general interest.

<EM>&gt; I'm planning to release my first novel online some how or another (if I ever 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finish it), but I'm prepared for the inevitable fact that if it becomes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; popular, it will be bootlegged.  I don't know if there is a practical way to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; avoid that. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I think eBooks (www.ebook.org or www.ebooks.org? perhaps) is working
<BR>
on a &quot;1-copy&quot; approach, but perhaps I'm wrong.  Somebody (with a faster
<BR>
link than I have currently) needs to investigate this a but further and
<BR>
get back to the list.
<BR>
<P>There is also an approach I've seen where you decide how much you
<BR>
want to make from it, release a chapter or two for free, then
<BR>
release additional chapters as people pay (according to their
<BR>
ability or desire) into a pool that unlocks the chapters when
<BR>
the funding hits certain milestones.
<BR>
<P>Then you don't worry how many copies are floating around because
<BR>
you got paid for it anyway.  [It won't make you a millionaire, but
<BR>
it will keep bread on the table if you are moderately productive.]
