</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Excessive health? Yes, you get over population. Excessive justice? For 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Excessive happiness? Yes of course. People that are too satisfied are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;motivated to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;further growth...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Um, excuse me, but isn't that precisely why we're all here...to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*maximize*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; such things as health, justice and happiness?  If you are really afraid 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you might become &quot;too healthy&quot; or &quot;too happy&quot;, how can you possibly call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; yourself an extropian?  I haven't read the ExI principles, but I'm sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there's nothing in there about placing any limits on things like health,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; longevity or happiness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Tell me, if cheap and easy nuclear fusion magically became possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;today, and within a few months most everybody had a fusion plant in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their back yard, what do you think would happen to the economy?
</EM><BR>
<P>Power would become cheap and lots of people (power co. employees) would 
<BR>
probably become unemployed.  What has that to do with health or happiness?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about if nanotech became magically possible today? I'll tell you: the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;economy would go into a major depression for a good 3-10 years. You are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;talking about making obsolete a whole economy almost overnight.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not even.  The economy would undergo a radical shift, but that is not the 
<BR>
same as a depresssion.  OK, so lots of people in the business of making 
<BR>
things lose their jobs.  So what?  As long as you buy your near anything box 
<BR>
before you get laid off, who needs a job?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Like an economy and levels of technology, things like health, justice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and happiness are achieved as meta-stable states within systems that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have limits on input and output, they are semi-closed systems. Progress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in improving or in moving to higher states of stability in these areas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can only occur at rates that can be survived. I am not saying that there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are absolute limits, but there are limits to what is possible to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;digested *today*.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that immortality for all *today* would present something of a 
<BR>
population growth problem.  But IMO immortality will follow nano, which will 
<BR>
make population growth a benefit, rather than a detriment.  Once we are able 
<BR>
to use substantially larger portions of the globe for human habitat 
<BR>
(including deserts, the poles and in, over and under the oceans - not to 
<BR>
mention space) the population growth problem evaporates.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you reach a state of total happiness, what more do you have to live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for.
</EM><BR>
<P>I already enjoy a state of total joy (not quite the same as happiness, but 
<BR>
pretty close).  I won't be totally happy until everyone else is too.  (I'm 
<BR>
one of those weirdos who can't be ecstatic while others are suffering.)
<BR>
<P>But overcoming all my obstacles will not make me ready for the dustbin.  
<BR>
There will still be plenty for me to live for, such as enjoying my own 
<BR>
happiness, satisfying my curiosities by lifelong learning, seeking out new 
<BR>
and unique people, places and experiences, reading all the books I don't 
<BR>
have time for, catching up on all the Seinfeld episodes I missed, writing 
<BR>
the novel I don't have time to finish now, recording the album I've never 
<BR>
had time to start, riding my mountain bike at all the exotic trails I've 
<BR>
heard about but never been able to go to, painting, living, loving and just 
<BR>
plain having a ball.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Being for endless growth also implies a constant reapprisal and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;redetermination of what will make us truly happy. Reaching such a state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;before you know you want to be there will merely cause you to fail to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;appreciate it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps.  I'm not convinced though.  I already know I want to be there and 
<BR>
I'm sure I'll appreciate it.
<BR>
