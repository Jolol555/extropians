Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumption of a range of dietary antioxidants may be beneficial in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;protecting low density lipoprotein (LDL) against oxidative
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;modification, as studies have demonstrated that antioxidants other than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vitamin E may also function against oxidation of LDL in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vitro. In the present study, the effect of polyphenol antioxidants on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;susceptibility of LDL to copper-mediated oxidation was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;investigated after feeding semi-purified diets to 3 groups of New Zealand
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;white (NZW) rabbits. All diets comprised 40% energy as fat with 17% energy as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oleic acid. Dietary fatty acid compositions were identical. Oils with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;different polyphenol contents were used to provide the dietary source of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oleic acid-refined olive oil, extra virgin olive oil and Trisun high oleic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sunflower seed oil. Polyphenolic compounds (hydroxytyrosol and p-tyrosol)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;could only be detected in the extra virgin olive oil. Vitamin E was equalised
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in all diets. LDL oxidizability in vitro
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;was determined by continuously monitoring the copper-induced formation of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;conjugated dienes after 6 weeks of experimental diet feeding. The lag phase
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;before demonstrable oxidation occurred was significantly increased in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;high polyphenol, extra virgin olive oil group (P &lt; 0.05) when compared with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;combined results from the low polyphenol group (refined olive oil and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trisun), even though the LDL vitamin E concentration in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;high polyphenol group was significantly lower. The rate of conjugated diene
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;formation was not influenced by the presence of dietary polyphenols. Results
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;demonstrate that antioxidants, possibly phenolic compounds which are present
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;only in extra virgin olive oil, may contribute to the endogenous antioxidant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;capacity of LDL, resulting in an increased resistance to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oxidation as determined in vitro.
