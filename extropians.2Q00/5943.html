<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would like to discuss the following three types of personalities:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  followers, leaders, and independent thinkers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  At some point in the future, people will have the ability to engineer the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  personalities of members of the succeeding generations.  If you were, say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  creating the members of an expedition that would colonize a new planet, how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  would you handle the independent thinking vs. &quot;true believer&quot; trait?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you're pointing in an interesting question, but I don't think the 
<BR>
particular hypothetical situation is one we're likely to see.  By the time we 
<BR>
have the technology to really colonize another planet, I think our abilities 
<BR>
will have flowered to the point that the idea of engineering otherwise 
<BR>
natural humans with just the changes you mention would be considered quaint; 
<BR>
sort of (but not exactly) like the people of early renaissance Europe 
<BR>
imagining that their feudal political structures would be transplanted in 
<BR>
toto to the New World.  In particular, I think the technological capabilities 
<BR>
of individuals will be so great that the &quot;hard work&quot; of extraterrestrial 
<BR>
colonization won't require highly organized groups of people working under 
<BR>
tight discipline, which seems to be a premise of your question.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  What is the difference between a tribal leader and a political leader, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  respect to personality?  I'm assuming here that a tribal leader does not 
</EM><BR>
use
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  force to get people to follow her but is followed voluntarily, and only so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  long as her leadership is beneficialy to the other members of the tribe.  A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  political leader, by definition, uses coercion.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bonnie, with respect, this sounds like you're laboring under the yoke of the 
<BR>
Meadeian anthropology of &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot; (which was just a 
<BR>
scientistic restatement of Rousseau's fantasy of the &quot;noble savage&quot;).  I 
<BR>
don't know of any real empirical basis for this view of primitive social 
<BR>
organization and leadership.  For instance, the Yanomamo of the Amazon 
<BR>
jungle, once thought to be the very epitome of the &quot;noble savage&quot;, have been 
<BR>
found to have a fairly violent culture, full of bloody power struggles, war 
<BR>
and casual rape.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Would it be better to have a group of independent thinkers (who could, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  example, figure out how to best utilize the resources of the new planet), 
</EM><BR>
or
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  would it be better to have just one or two independent thinkers and the 
</EM><BR>
rest
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  followers and leaders (presumably only a couple of leaders and the rest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  followers)?  In nomadic tribal cultures leaders generally have the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  material possessions as followers and do the same sorts of work as far as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  gathering and hunting food.  Thus, there would be less reason for a 
</EM><BR>
follower
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  to resent his or her role as follower than in a more complex culture where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the leader has a better house, better clothes, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would be greatly surprised to find that the &quot;alphas&quot; in such cultures don't 
<BR>
have better mating opportunities arising from their higher status and that 
<BR>
mating competition doesn't give rise to stress and conflict.  This should be 
<BR>
true regardless of the material wealth of the culture.  It certainly seems to 
<BR>
be universal among primates.  For instance, a recent study, described in 
<BR>
Science News within the last couple of months, of cortisol levels in male 
<BR>
baboons showed that this stress hormone was considerably higher in 
<BR>
lower-status males on a constant basis and shot up to truly 
<BR>
health-threatening levels during periods of status-conflict.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  In the hypothetical planet colonizing expedition, would the people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  engineered to be followers resent the sort of roles they'd been genetically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  assigned to?
</EM><BR>
<P>Assuming a population of otherwise natural homo sapiens, in which the &quot;betas&quot; 
<BR>
KNEW they'd been engineered to be such, I'd assume there would be a serious 
<BR>
problem with this.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  In a civilization rich with the fruits of nanotechnology, would leaders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  enjoy any special privileges? If the option existed for a person who had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  been born and educated to be a follower to be re-engineered into a leader,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  would many followers choose this option? What of independent thinkers?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Would they want to change?  Would followers and/or leaders have any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  incentive to become independent thinkers?
</EM><BR>
<P>These are going to be very interesting questions if we discover clear genetic 
<BR>
determinants for these character traits and a means to change them.  Assuming 
<BR>
a long enough &quot;transition time&quot; in which a genetic technology that can 
<BR>
deliver these results exists, but before a universal economy of 
<BR>
superabundance, these questions could cause a lot of social stress.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  To what extent do people living at this very moment have the ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  change from followers to independent thinkers?  How about the other way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  around?  From independent thinkers to followers? What incentives are there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to change from one to the other?
</EM><BR>
<P>Observing people with these character traits in the business world, I see 
<BR>
&quot;alphas&quot; now investing a lot of time in trying to understand and adopt the 
<BR>
habits of more creative type individuals - usually without much success.  But 
<BR>
I also see them coming up with the workable solution of simply buying the 
<BR>
talent of creative people.
