<EM>&gt;&gt; Art, science: what is the (main) difference?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; My opinion is simple.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Sciences have some &quot;attractor-like&quot; pattern. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Researchers &quot;discover&quot; exactly the same thing (law, theorem, ...).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Even in very different times, countries, &quot;languages&quot; '(i.e. quantum 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; mechanics).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; That's definitely not true, in art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Michelangelo is far from Raffaello, etc.. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; In art there's not a common language, world, meaning, aim, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; object, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here are some comments from my forthcoming (July) Greenwood Press book
<BR>
TRANSREALIST FICTION that I think somewhat overlap this enquiry:
<BR>
<P><P>SCIENCE AND/OR FICTION
<BR>
<P>On the face of it, looked at through traditional prejudice, it's hard to
<BR>
find a pair of concepts more estranged than `science' and `fiction'.  Each
<BR>
seems to square off against the other, key instances of the celebrated
<BR>
split between the Two Cultures, artistic humanities versus natural
<BR>
sciences. Recall a roster of the mythology of their oppositions:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science, we suppose, is the disciplined quest for absolute, fundamental
<BR>
truth. All art, by contrast (to bend Walter Pater's famous dictum) aspires
<BR>
to the conditional.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiction's home is the heart, while science dwells in the head.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science seeks to condense the empirical into broad generalisations,
<BR>
compress the thousand things into naked equations: the objective. Fiction
<BR>
strives to render or construct the contingent, the particular, the fleeting
<BR>
and ambiguous: the subjective.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiction burrows inward, science soars outward.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science simplifies into stark graphs valid for all times and places.
<BR>
Fiction complexifies into nuance, joy, heartbreak, the uncanny, the
<BR>
sublime, the provisional, the extraordinary within the ordinary.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such divisions into contrasted categories swiftly fall apart, however. Is
<BR>
it fiction or science which is holistic rather than reductive? Science, we
<BR>
guess at first, is surely the very paradigm of the reductive, stripping the
<BR>
meat and fat from the bone, boiling down the flensed carcase into a
<BR>
skeletal substrate, all sumptuous life reduced to numbers. But that's true
<BR>
also of the mechanics of fiction, as narratologists show us: every imagined
<BR>
action, in folk story and Tolstoy alike, derives from a handful or two of
<BR>
types, functions, actants, deployed in words built from an equally small
<BR>
number of distinguishable acoustic or graphic segments. Meanwhile, even the
<BR>
most austere and limited science cannot (or should not) escape the context
<BR>
of its whole surround, as the non-local connections of quantum theory
<BR>
prove, the vast geometries of Relativity's inertial frames, the dense
<BR>
ecological webs of the life sciences, the no-less-dense economic and
<BR>
psychological webs of culture. Fiction's mythemes, science's vectors and
<BR>
tensors, serve alike to direct us in (re)constructing stories adequate, in
<BR>
some appropriate and contextually satisfying fashion, to the unspeakable
<BR>
plenitude of the world.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the unpromising zeugma science fiction is not so anomalous after all,
<BR>
perhaps. Science and fiction alike are attempts on an imaginative embrace
<BR>
of the world we move through, the world within which we have our being as
<BR>
striving, suffering, malicious and loving human beings. That world extends,
<BR>
we now know, from elementary strings or membranes in eleven dimensions
<BR>
supporting the quantum, all the way out to the unbounded boundaries of a
<BR>
cosmos tens of billions of light-years in extent, 13 billion years old. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sit beside a spark-spitting, hand-warming fire in the dark of the night
<BR>
and tell stories beneath the stars is to find yourself poised between
<BR>
infinitesimal and infinite, speaking (even in the tongues of angels, even
<BR>
with charity) in a language always inadequate to the world's capture. And
<BR>
even granting those limits, so much of the world is now known best by the
<BR>
several sciences that it would be absurd and self-mutilating for a
<BR>
story-teller to ignore that rich, dense and exfoliating wisdom, just as a
<BR>
scientist lacking utterance, argument, engagement, contest, narrative is
<BR>
not merely mute but entirely ineffectual qua scientist, let alone as a
<BR>
fellow denizen of the human community.
