I just got, for the umpteenth time, one of those supposed 'legal' chain letters in
<BR>
the email that have you send $5 to three or four people and ask them to add you to
<BR>
their mail list, and you then send it on with your own name on the list. I have
<BR>
been noticing that the stories have been getting better and better. Today's was
<BR>
about how a 15 year old kid's mom discovered $71,000 in her kids closet that he
<BR>
had made of the deal, it went on to 'interview' him about how he kept getting all
<BR>
this money, conveniently he had his own post office box for it to be sent to, how
<BR>
he kept having to bike all over town to different banks to exchanged all the $5
<BR>
bills for twenties, fifties, and hundreds....it was quite entertaining, probably
<BR>
the best one I've yet seen. I almost wanted to do it myself this time, it was that
<BR>
good...except for one thing: all of the names and addresses were in England, so
<BR>
why would US law apply to them, and what are the British laws on the subject?
<BR>
<P>Anyways, it seems that the internet is demonstrating a sort of memetic evolution
<BR>
in chain letter technology, those that survive are the ones with the best stories,
<BR>
the most 'hook'. The better question is: is anyone making that kind of money? I've
<BR>
got some extropic projects to fund and I could use the money... ;)
