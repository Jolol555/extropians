<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Which do you see as the bigger technical hurdle: recognition of objects in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the household or locomotion, once they are recognized?
</EM><BR>
<P>Eugene: 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem is both building highly dynamic maps, and navigating in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them fast enough, while not failing frequently (falling down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stairs, etc.).
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we can gain a lot of understanding by analyzing this situation in
<BR>
as much detail as possible so I'll take it as far as I can and perhaps
<BR>
someone else can shed some light on it. Words like &quot;highly dynamic
<BR>
maps&quot; and &quot;navigating&quot; can be somewhat ambiguous. So we study exactly what
<BR>
is happening. It is not so different from what I have done many times in
<BR>
diagnostic work for mentally-physically handicapped people. We start
<BR>
with a family report that Johnny who has some mental and physical
<BR>
handicaps doesn't pick up after himself, is untidy, etc. Other than the
<BR>
standardized psychological tests we try to zero in on what Johnny is doing
<BR>
when he crosses the room and picks something up. Exactly where do the
<BR>
difficulties lie? Is it a visual handicap? Perceptual? A motor
<BR>
dysfunction? If so, exactly what among many possible motor dysfunctions?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I was very positively impressed by Hans Moraved during
<BR>
<EM>&gt; last Stanford meet, discussing these points
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I think he is one of the top people in his field. Wasn't his PhD work
<BR>
on the &quot;Stanford Cart&quot; ? So let's call our robopatient SC. What is SC's
<BR>
problem? 
<BR>
<P>(1) In traversing a room SC encounters a visual field with a large number
<BR>
of objects demarcated from one another by borders/edges, patterns etc.
<BR>
Is SC able to ITEMIZE ALL OBJECTS in the room, given enough time,
<BR>
computing power etc? In other words, at the level of a basic visual system
<BR>
required to detect (itemize) all objects in the field, is SC's artificial
<BR>
visual system up to the task? Forget about speed, computing power,
<BR>
programming etc. at this level. It is a question of object recognition.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I don't have a definitive answer at this time. I think the best
<BR>
people to answer that question might be private companies selling
<BR>
artificial vision systems. I came across the web site for a company called
<BR>
&quot;Cognex&quot; which billed itself as number one in this field but they still
<BR>
haven't replied. We are told otherwise that these systems can pick human
<BR>
faces out of a crowd and use them to match with police records and
<BR>
Kurzweil (1999) tells us some banks use face recognition technology.
<BR>
Then there is iris recognition and finger print recognition. Last week,
<BR>
Discovery did a report on the robotic milking machines which half of the
<BR>
new milk parlours in Europe now use. Any machine which can recognize a
<BR>
cow's udder and teat can't be too &quot;visually handicapped&quot;. But I still
<BR>
wonder if there is some new discovery required before a good, all-purpose
<BR>
general visual system can be developed. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is crucial to my whole investigation. Do we require &quot;only&quot; huge
<BR>
amounts of additional labour and funding to advance P2 and P3 to P4 and P5
<BR>
etc. or do we need some new inventions? Let me illustrate that another
<BR>
way. Let's suppose we use &quot;cyborg&quot; technology for comparison. Kurzweil
<BR>
(1999) foresees great progress in this technology before 2099 and I just
<BR>
saw a report that Michael Saylor is going to invest in it. However, before
<BR>
the things Kurzweil foresees come to pass some new inventions/innovations
<BR>
are required. It is almost impossible to rationally predict when these
<BR>
things will happen or how much they will cost. So researchers can now
<BR>
&quot;fuse&quot; a few rat or leech neurons with a computer chip. Who can say what
<BR>
it will cost, etc. to do that on a larger scale and with human neurons?
<BR>
Next, even if it can be done while keeping the tissue alive, how do we
<BR>
control the signals from biological to mechanical sub-systems and
<BR>
vice-versa? These developments and more are very &quot;iffy&quot;. On the other
<BR>
hand, it looks to me like advancing P3 to PX which will surpass human
<BR>
equivalency (a Moravec concept) in many ways requires &quot;only&quot; quantitative
<BR>
contributions. That is a very important distinction because if it is
<BR>
correct it means we can rationally and convincingly spell out what
<BR>
benefits investors/consumers will get from spending another $100 m. or
<BR>
$100 b. or $100 t. So that is why I do these analyses. The next being...
<BR>
<P>(2) Locomotion/motion. Suppose SC can identify everything in the room. Can
<BR>
it get to these objects? The gross movements in going to the site where  
<BR>
there is, let us say a collection of electric cords isn't a problem as
<BR>
long as the cords can be recognized and the commands given to relocate.
<BR>
SC may wheel, crawl or walk its way there. No problem. The fine movements
<BR>
on site could be a problem. But again it doesn't look to me like the kind
<BR>
of problem which more time and money can't solve. Range-finding is the key
<BR>
issue (artificial depth perception). Range finders which can guide a
<BR>
robotic gripper to a cow's teat or the gas cap of a car must be pretty
<BR>
efficient. So I'm not worried about this problem area. If early models of
<BR>
humanoid need a &quot;walker&quot; as a third leg to stabilize their walking that is
<BR>
not a problem. Humanoids could even be built with 3, 4, 5 or 6 legs for
<BR>
household use.
<BR>
<P>(3) Artificial Brain Power. I am proceeding on the assumption that
<BR>
whatever problems we throw at SC, there is a computer powerful enough to
<BR>
handle them. Before that I am assuming that the commands required for SC
<BR>
to cross a room and pick up the cords etc. are superimposed on software
<BR>
which &quot;only&quot; requires a large amount of code writing time.
<BR>
<P>I think that's about it for an overview of this kind of analysis. The
<BR>
problem looks overwhelming for a doctoral student (like Moravec when he
<BR>
was working on this initially). But how much money does a doctoral student
<BR>
get for equipment etc? He's lucky to get a few thousand. And even as a
<BR>
professor over a lifetime career he's lucky to get a few million. As you
<BR>
said earlier Eugene, even $100 m. for Honda Humanoids is a small sum
<BR>
compared to what is needed.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these big problems only require big expenditures of labour and
<BR>
money, that would be very good news for the robotics industry BECAUSE THEY
<BR>
CAN BE ACCURATELY ESTIMATED. It is a pure guess as to how much it will
<BR>
cost to build a nanoassembler or to do the genetic/medical research
<BR>
required to double a human lifespan. But it should be possible to estimate
<BR>
the number of hours required to write a program so that SC can carry on a
<BR>
standard conversation as long as somebody out there (in psyc, law,
<BR>
linguistics etc.) knows all the rules for conversing. Do they? This is the
<BR>
kind of question the proposed ed tv program would continue with, asking,
<BR>
criterion-by-criterion, what does it take to attain &quot;human
<BR>
equivalency&quot; for our consumer robot?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits in theory are enormous. The machine psychology system of
<BR>
particular interest is that of work performance. Now I'm not saying that
<BR>
research should take the humanoid or nonhumanoid path but as long as the
<BR>
Japanese are going ahead with a number of humanoid projects I'm happy to
<BR>
analyze them.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there some aspect of artificial sensation-perception,
<BR>
artificial behaviour or artificial brain which could not be brought up to
<BR>
human equivalency for WORK PERFORMANCE ONLY by investing huge amounts of  
<BR>
money and labour? I don't care if PX can breathe like a human or chew gum
<BR>
like a human or has the skin texture of a human. I only care if it can do
<BR>
work like a human. If it can, I think we'll pay every cent we have to
<BR>
develop it. And the GPP (Gross Planetary Product) is about $50 t. So
<BR>
there's the summary and bottom line of what I am investigating for this
<BR>
proposed ed tv program. If you can think of any work-related criterion
<BR>
which would require a new invention rather than more funding/labour please
<BR>
let me know.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;(despite that he's Herr
<BR>
<EM>&gt; TechnoHitler).
</EM><BR>
<P>This is fascinating class of human...unique. We've never had roboticists
<BR>
on the planet before. So I'm very interested in what people like Moravec,
<BR>
Warwick, Brooks etc. say. They are a different kind of cat as the saying
<BR>
goes. For sure they all tell first rate &quot;scary stories&quot; and I'd invite any
<BR>
of them to a Hallowe'en party.
<BR>
