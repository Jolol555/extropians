<EM>&gt; If you magically introduced one of these aircars for a price of about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $20,000 today, with a production capacity of a million units a year, GM,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ford, Toyota, Daimler Chrysler, et al would all be declaring bankruptcy in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; short order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unless of course, they had all at least partially refitted their factories
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to PRODUCE aircars!  Then those factories would be busier then ever.  Hans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moller has been trying very hard to get a big auto maker to partner with him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so he can have the resources necessary to make the aircar practical and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; affordable but he has had no takers.  When trying to do this in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aerospace sector a Boeing v.p. told him &quot;we just don't see a large market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for aircars!&quot; lol!!
</EM><BR>
<P>My argument is that companies like GM, et al are hamstrung by existing
<BR>
factories, existing machinery and assembly technology, and by unions that have
<BR>
prevented them from robotization at just about every turn. There is absolutely
<BR>
no possible way that an existing manufacturer can make an aircar for that price,
<BR>
so saying they can 'refit' their factories is a false argument. They would go
<BR>
broke trying to do it, and they will still wind up with millions of unemployed
<BR>
auto workers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I will say that Moller has kept on pushing back the date of his flight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; testing for his latest four-seater aircar design which is the one he wants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to mass produce.  This is not a good signal to potential investors out there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but at least he is doing his best to not rush things and really get botched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; results.
</EM><BR>
<P>Moller's aircar has been stymied by his need for advanced and reliable
<BR>
compact/light powerplants. He had to buy a rotary engine manufacturer, and dump
<BR>
money into advancing their engine design and manufacturing to produce the
<BR>
engines he wanted.

<EM>&gt; Good! A company stupid enough to be ignorant of advances in its own industry

<EM>&gt; dumb to live.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree!  It will be very interesting to see how everyone jumps on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bandwagon when the aircar is shown to be practical and is being mass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produced by one of the giants of auto or aerospace manufacturing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Aint gonna happen unless they break the UAW and the aerospace unions. Neither
<BR>
one wants robotized assembly, and you won't get affordable aircars any other
<BR>
way.

<EM>&gt; Mike lorrey continued:

<EM>&gt; and you'd have millions of unionized autoworkers out on the streets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unemployed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nope, they would be most likely building aircars!
</EM><BR>
<P>Using existing facilities, methods, and personnel would not be able to produce
<BR>
them for a price affordable to the average person. This is the central crux of
<BR>
my arguement, so your retort is baseless.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; John Clarke asked:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then who is making all those aircars?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<P>Robotized factories employing a small fraction of the number of people that are
<BR>
employed by the auto makers. Thats the only way to make aircars that are
<BR>
affordable to the average person. The labor overhead of traditional
<BR>
humano-centric assembly lines is just too much to make aircars affordable.
