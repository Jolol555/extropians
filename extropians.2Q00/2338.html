<EM>&gt; An exact replica of you (you do realize what that means, don't you?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is you. This means, there are two instances of you, both being in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exact the same state. As long as they don't bifurcate, I don't see why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can't delete one of them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Eugene, let me paraphrase your viewpoint into a different viewpoint.  What
<BR>
you are saying sounds similar to the belief that the copy is an inactive
<BR>
backup.  As long as it hasn't been activated or allowed to process a single
<BR>
thought on its own, it can be deleted.  Since it has never run it's neural
<BR>
processor or processed a single thought, it is more like a standby computer
<BR>
with a backup disk that has not ever been turned on.  Until we turn it on,
<BR>
it has never been alive.
<BR>
<P>Is this consistent with your viewpoint?  Stated in the above words, I must
<BR>
agree.  An inert backup copy that has never become functional is just a
<BR>
backup copy and can be deleted.  Its software program is not running, has
<BR>
never run, and cannot be terminated.  At this point, you are merely
<BR>
destroying one of my backup copies, but not a running consciousness.  Your
<BR>
analogy with abortion is very close here, with this copy ready to be born
<BR>
and become alive in an instant.
<BR>
<P>I think I agree with both points of view, and we are getting caught up with
<BR>
semantics of &quot;what is death&quot; and the details of &quot;why&quot; the copy is not yet
<BR>
alive.  I was so distracted by your argument that the copies must be
<BR>
identical, that it had not previously occurred to me that the copy had not
<BR>
yet been allowed to have independent thought on its own yet.  To put my own
<BR>
semantic spin on things, you are interrupting the process of creating a copy
<BR>
and not finishing the final step of giving it consciousness.  Until that
<BR>
final step, it is not yet alive.  It is an inert clone of spare parts that
<BR>
has not been animated.
