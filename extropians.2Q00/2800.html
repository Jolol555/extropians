<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Mike I think you were too hard on Zero, tho.  I know that

<EM>&gt; &gt; he did publish his first and last name on the list last time

<EM>&gt; &gt; we went thru this particular memefest, actually I think he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; did so at least twice before.   {8-]  spike

<P>Whats the discomfort with addresses?  The phone book
<BR>
disgorges that kind of info in bulk.  Last time I was house
<BR>
shopping I learned that your mortgage status (!) is public domain.
<BR>
Info.  Went to the Sunnyvale library, could look up who owned
<BR>
what house, its configuration, lot size, how much they paid,
<BR>
when, and how much they owed on the property.
<BR>
<P>Even I, the original info nudist, could see where that might
<BR>
be a bad idea: if some litigious jehovahs witness wanted to
<BR>
arrange an accident in front of my house to sue for
<BR>
damages because I had an uneven crack in the walkway,
<BR>
the first thing she would do would be to look up someone who
<BR>
had their house paid for, or nearly so.
<BR>
<P>The real estate agent last time I sold a place said that a property
<BR>
up to its eyeballs in mortgage is worth more than one that is
<BR>
paid for.  (?)  Thats where the info comes from, the library.
<BR>
Or did a few years ago.  On microfilm. Updated semiannually.
