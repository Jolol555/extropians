<EM>&gt;Subject: More Green Party (was SOC: Radical Anti-Genengineering)

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;zeb, I think your concern that other parties might adopt Green Party
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;provisions is well-founded. I hate to say this, because I love my home, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think the time may be coming pretty soon when the only sensible thing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do is to leave the US. The big question is where to go.
</EM><BR>
<P>Space, I hope. That's one of the main reasons I support space exploration, 
<BR>
because it opens up a frontier, and you can leave. People who are in favor 
<BR>
of GPUSA (green party usa) type policies - I make this as a statistical and 
<BR>
not absolute claim - would not have the intelligence or psychological drive 
<BR>
to expand into a frontier. This is what would make it safe there.
<BR>
Barring that - I don't know.
<BR>
Antarctica maybe? I actually really wanted to go to Antarctica as a kid, and 
<BR>
had plans in my head of how to live there. There's a book called &quot;the last 
<BR>
frontiers on earth&quot;, which is pretty bad, but has some info on living in 
<BR>
antarctica, as well as on floating antarctic ice bergs, which seems pretty 
<BR>
cool I think, but would be very dangerous (I'm scared to live in CA because 
<BR>
of the earth quakes).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There was a little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussion of this a few days ago.  I think I'll do some heavy duty 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the question.  It's possible that such considerations as existing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;facilities should have a relatively low priority, since that's a deficiency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that can be corrected.  If the US moves towards many of the Green Party
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;provisions, I guarantee there won't be decent medical care here.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure you're familiar with the clinton proposals for a national health 
<BR>
care plan.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;friend who got pneumonia when she was in Moscow and had to go into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hospital there.  In this large city, they were still using medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;techniques that were common in the US at the beginning of the 20th century.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That's the kind of progress we have to look forward to here if this country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;follows Nader's inspiration.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Oh yeah, everyone in the US better learn how to grow their own food, too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Green Party plans to kill agriculture along with industry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bonnie
</EM><BR>
<P>If they ever reach 10% in the polls, start hoarding.
