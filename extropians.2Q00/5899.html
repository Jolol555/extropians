<EM>&gt; &gt; Aargh!  Just as we're being accused of

<EM>&gt; Yup. Y'all gotta work on your PR!! (or something more

<P>Thank you Brian. People need to get it through their thick heads that talking
<BR>
about jewish people or judaism is not, per se, anti-semitism. My talking about
<BR>
my experiences with jewish members of my family and other members of the jewish
<BR>
community is not anti-semitic, it is being informative, making observations
<BR>
based on real events.
<BR>
<P>People who don't know about or have experience with jewish people may say things
<BR>
that are not accurate, may be stereotypical, but is not neccessarily
<BR>
anti-semitic, it is merely innocent ignorance. People who talk about jewish
<BR>
people or jewish culture may have opinions about it that may find disagreement
<BR>
from jewish people, but that does not mecessarily make them anti-semitic,
<BR>
especially if they themselves are jews. Anti-semitism is the active and knowing
<BR>
act of disliking or hating jewish people, and making statements that are
<BR>
purposely false about jewish people in an attempt to slander the popular opinion
<BR>
of jewish people. If you think otherwise, lets use the logic in reverse: for a
<BR>
jewish person to go around and accuse every gentile who disagrees with him or
<BR>
her of being an anti-semite is itself anti-semitic, because it negatively
<BR>
impacts upon the popular opinion of jews.
<BR>
<P>Last year when I spent a weekend visiting my jewish cousin Andrew in Maine, he
<BR>
had a party, where several of his more 'redneck' freinds learned for the first
<BR>
time that he was jewish. They did not think this was a bad thing, or think
<BR>
negatively of him as a result, though they did begin using derogatory jewish
<BR>
descriptives when they were kidding him after that. Andrew's girlfriend at the
<BR>
time was a rather liberal gentile girl, who took great offense to his freinds
<BR>
using such derogatory terms, and she was shocked that Andrew didn't get pissed
<BR>
off about it. He said,&quot;These guys are too ignorant to know any better, cause I'm
<BR>
likely the first jewish person they've ever known personally in their lives, so
<BR>
its useless to be pissed off about it. They'll eventually figure it out, and my
<BR>
getting pissy before they reach understanding won't help things at all but to
<BR>
help confirm any prejudices they may have already.&quot;
