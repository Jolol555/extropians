<P>
I have to admit this pursuit by Mike Lorrey to find out all he can about Michael Powers(Zero) is getting kind of surrealistic.  
<BR>
<P>Zero wrote in response to Senator Mike &quot;Joe McCarthy&quot; lorrey:
<BR>
My name (for the I-don't-know-how-manyth time) is Michael Powers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What are you hiding?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not *hiding* anything.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Who do you work for?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am self employed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Are you a convict?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Are you a sexual predator?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Are you a fugitive?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Are you a communist or socialist?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P>Zero continued:
<BR>
I post to this list I expect my opinions to stand or fall on their own merits, not on who I am or who people think I am.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Mike, the correct phrasing is &quot;are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?&quot;  A rotten former commie could get away from you if the question is not phrased properly! ;)  Seriously Mike, I think you would have made a damn good lawyer. 
<BR>
<P>I totally agree with Zero's final statement.  It is certainly nice to know something about the background of the poster but it is not &quot;a requirement.&quot;  
<BR>
<P>I personally chose to use my real name and share with the list members about my life so they would have a fuller understanding of me as a person.  I feel I have benefitted from this, but it is a very personal choice.
<BR>
<P>I realize Mike Lorrey is pressing home his argument about a transparent society, but he needs to do it without attacking Zero as a person.  I am on a daily basis impressed by the quality of posts by both people and want them to continue their exchanges, but without becoming enemies.
<BR>
<P>Zero wrote:
<BR>
Sorry, you can call me a &quot;coward&quot; if you like, but I tell my kids all the time that it is stupid to give out personal information about yourself to people you don't know. I think that rule applies equally well to adults as to kids. I don't know you. 
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>A very good point that we all need to keep in mind.  Zero has not only himself but his family to be concerned about.  I believe Mike Lorrey is an honorable man, but there are many people on this list I do not know who might not be as trustworthy.  I have gotten to the point with several listmembers where I feel I do know them and can trust them, but that takes time.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
