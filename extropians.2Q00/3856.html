<EM>&gt; Well I am not a rocket scientist :0 But I can scan in a chart from their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business plan (or perhaps it is on their old site at nanopropulsion.com)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showing how their system is waaay better than the shuttle or other methods.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The idea is that the nanoaluminum allows for a much denser mix with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other materials in the fuel, and therefore much faster reaction rates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and therefore much much higher thrust than what you get from conventional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mixing techniques.
</EM><BR>
<P>I read through their site, and yes, it does appear that they can make an
<BR>
end-burning solid motor work well.  Their &quot;specific thrust&quot; figure of
<BR>
merit merely shows that the end burning is possible- which I grant could
<BR>
improve solid motor loading density by perhaps 35 to 40 percent, the
<BR>
amount of empty volume normally cast into solid motors.  
<BR>
<P>However, the simple fact remains that the sea level Isp of
<BR>
Al/perchlorate/HTPB motors is at best about 260 seconds, while even low
<BR>
tech pressure fed LOX/kerosene is about 280.  The vacuum performance is
<BR>
even more strongly in favor of the liquids.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also they go on about how this would also allow for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nozzleless rockets that could even consume their casing on the way up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There would be no &quot;hole&quot; in the center of the fuel, it would just burn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the end. What do you think?
</EM><BR>
<P>Here they are flat-out wrong.  Without a de laval nozzle to efficiently
<BR>
expand the hot gases to supersonic velocity and collimate the exhaust
<BR>
into a unidirectional flow as opposed to a hemisphere, their Isp will
<BR>
drop in half.  The only way to get around this would be to use a
<BR>
micro-orion method as proposed for laser launchers- detonating a thin
<BR>
surface on a large area produces very high pressures so that you *can*
<BR>
get good expansion off a flat plate. (Basically the expansion from
<BR>
~50,000 psi to 1 psi takes only a few inches, so that the gases expand
<BR>
in a 1-dimensional manner except near the edge.)  Alas, the nozzleless
<BR>
method only works with detonations, so either a gigawatt laser or a
<BR>
block of TNT are needed. Deflagrating propellants need not apply...
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; They seemed to think their biggest problem is that the missle tracking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems are unable to handle the higher speeds.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, an end-burning solid rocket motor would only have slightly increased
<BR>
Isp due to more efficient combustion and a small increase in enthalpy,
<BR>
and a longer burn time due to the larger propellant charge.  Software
<BR>
changes would take that incremental change in stride.  Basically, it's a
<BR>
neat hack, but with limited potential.
<BR>
<P>The one big bad ugly thing is that any sort of disbond or crack in the
<BR>
grain would be even more dangerous than for a center-burning motor. 
<BR>
Titan SRMs have a bad habit of blowing up when the buring area increases
<BR>
by a few percent from a crack- imagine how critical propellant integrity
<BR>
would be at 100x the burning rate.  A small void that would make a
<BR>
slower burn rate motor merely hiccup would double the burn rate of the
<BR>
end-burner... instant pretty fireworks.
