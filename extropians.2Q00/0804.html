<EM>&gt; &gt; I would have to think though, that scaling up the Arienne 5 or

<EM>&gt; Getting Energia to be more reliable?  Just use the existing Russian

Perhaps I'm confusing the names.  Their mid-size booster (the one
<BR>
they use for missions to the Mir station) seems quite reliable.
<BR>
There large boster (Proton/Energia?) has had quite a few failures
<BR>
though.  For example, I think it dumped the last Russian Mars mission
<BR>
and I think that Kazakstan had launches on hold for a while because an
<BR>
even more recent mission had to be aborted and there was a dispute
<BR>
over who was going to pay to cleanup the trash.
<BR>
<P>I'm also under the impression that their Saturn 5 equivalent moon
<BR>
rocket suffered 2-3 failures, the last of which I think took out the
<BR>
launch pad and ended up being canceled entirely.
<BR>
<P>JBIS has run a few articles about the Russian space histories and
<BR>
capabilities over the last several years, but I don't have them
<BR>
handy.
<BR>
<P>Surely, there should be some summary on the web of the capacities
<BR>
of the various launch vehicles, but the only ones I ever seem to
<BR>
find when I go looking are years out of date.
