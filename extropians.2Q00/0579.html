<P>
<EM>&gt; People who live in liberal democracies tend to forget about the violent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basis of government power, because it is usually hidden beneath a veil of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; civility and bland legalisms. But that doesn't mean it isn't there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Democratic governments kill their citizens all the time (just ask a drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dealer). Usually they direct their violence against 'criminals', which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what makes them better than police states - but you have to remember that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the government gets to define who is and is not a 'criminal', and the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real limit to what it can do is the willingness of the general public to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acquiesce.
</EM><BR>
<P>All real power is based in force or the threat of force, and all I
<BR>
think you're pointing out here is that we've granted a monopoly on
<BR>
physical coercion to our elected government. That's treacherous, of
<BR>
course, like any concentration of power, but in the end I don't see
<BR>
what the other options would be. I like the idea of collaborative
<BR>
anarchy - it would be great if we were all equals and we could mediate
<BR>
all our differences from bargaining positions of equal strength, but I
<BR>
don't believe it works. No one stays equal - you get kings,
<BR>
syndicates, warring city states - you get power which is unaccountable
<BR>
to the people living under it. And that power preserves and
<BR>
strengthens itself and wipes out threats to it's survival. While we
<BR>
differ over whether it's been excessive, I'm sure you'd agree
<BR>
Microsoft has been a vicious competitor. I shudder to think what the
<BR>
world would be like if they and institutions like them could raise
<BR>
private armies to wage wars against competitors, strike contracts
<BR>
with private police agencies to search your home for pirated software,
<BR>
conduct tariff negotiations via cruise missile, etc. This is obviously
<BR>
a bit hyperbolic, but it at least evokes my vision of the nation without
<BR>
some ultimate, constitutionally restrained, publicly elected and
<BR>
publicly accountable authority. But maybe I'm cynical or got beat up
<BR>
one to many times in high-school.
<BR>
<P>I certainly don't think our government is perfect - drug laws, as you
<BR>
mentioned, are a great example. I'm writing from New York State where
<BR>
we live under the Rockerfeller Laws - extraordinarily harsh, mandatory
<BR>
sentences for trivial drug offenses, deliberately designed to get
<BR>
guilty pleas and bypass the pesky impediments to justice posed by the
<BR>
right to trial and the presumption of innocence. And I'm fairly irked
<BR>
by paying $5 for a $1 pack of cigarettes because our leaders, in their
<BR>
great and abiding wisdom, have decided smoking is bad for me and I
<BR>
ought to be dissuaded or punished for a character flaw. In the end
<BR>
though - our government is, at least in principle, bound by the
<BR>
constitution and accountability to the electorate. Business has no
<BR>
such restrictions - it's only charter is to maximize it's stock
<BR>
holders value and the only constraints on how it does that are those
<BR>
imposed by power from above. Without federal power to protect them,
<BR>
the principles of our democracy are bullshit. Private interests have
<BR>
no obligation to observe them. Of course I have reservations, but
<BR>
we've had 200 hundred years of smooth transition of power, relative
<BR>
freedom and reasonable domestic tranquility.
<BR>
<P>I object to the us-versus-them character that discussion of government
<BR>
has in so many of these debates. Government is us - it's elected by us
<BR>
and made up of us - it's not some alien force, some evil monster out
<BR>
to crush all that's good and free in the world. I have faith that most
<BR>
people in government are just like you and me, and most of them
<BR>
believe in what they're doing and honesty feel they're doing what's
<BR>
right - even when I disagree with them.
