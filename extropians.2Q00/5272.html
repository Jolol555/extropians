Hi!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A better question for the short term is to ask what is it about society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in nations where such things occur that not only causes or contributes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to this happening, but also what is that allows it to continue? We don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have such problems here in the US over any sport I know of.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problems with soccer fans have been solved in England (generally
<BR>
considered the most dangerous fans). By increasing security in stadiums
<BR>
and, most of all, by identifying hooligans and punishing them (either by
<BR>
jail or by preventing them to go to games). In Italy or Turkey, on the
<BR>
contrary, authorities don't really want to solve these problems; my theory
<BR>
is that it's in their culture to support their teams in a very aggressive
<BR>
fashion and authorities don't want to intervene. As for sports in the US, I
<BR>
agree there's much less violence; I remember watching an NBA game at NY in
<BR>
which at the start of the game it was asked the public not to use
<BR>
aggressive language. Something I, as a Portuguese, find amazing; it can
<BR>
happen for police officers to insult players from the away team in
<BR>
Portuguese soccer matches! Anyway, in the US you have seasonal riots, high
<BR>
incidence of violent crimes, etc. to compensate for a lack of violence in
<BR>
sports.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes.
