<EM>&gt; &gt; Nanopowdered aluminum is not all that remarkable- there's a product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; called AlEx or some such which is nanoscale aluminum powder made by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exploding a wire with a capacitor discharge in a helium atmosphere.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has a slightly positive heat of formation relative to bulk Al, but solid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fuels are inherently a poor match for orbital launch- you get better Isp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and effective bulk density out of liquid fuels, and for SSTO or even a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cheap TSTO, delta-V is most important.  Solids are great for tactical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; propulsion (ie missiles) but just can't compete with liquids for system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bulk density, mass fraction, and Isp.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is something I've wondered. If liquid fuel is so much better, why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does the shuttle, the Delta, the Araine, the Titan, etc all need solid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boosters to get decent enough mass fractions to put decent payloads in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orbit? I was wondering if people were biased toward hydrogen merely for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purists sake. Sure you get great Isp, but you get great Isp from an ion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engine too, and you wouldn't want to power a launch system with an ion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engine.

<P>Large solid fuel rockets were developed for strategic missile
<BR>
propulsion- were it not for that subsidy, they would not be in use
<BR>
today.  Disregarding political and operational issues, solids do provide
<BR>
good thrust/weight ratios, which are the important feature for
<BR>
boosters.  Lower stages are not as sensitive to Isp and mass fraction as
<BR>
upper stages, so solids are acceptable there.  Note that upper stages on
<BR>
commercial launch vehicles do emphasize Isp, and most are hydrogen
<BR>
fueled.
<BR>
<P>For better Space Shuttle operations safety and performance, pressure-fed
<BR>
LOX-kerosene boosters would have been a better choice- but important
<BR>
congressional committee member was from Utah, so SRBs were speced and
<BR>
Thiokol got the job even though another company had a better SRB design
<BR>
and more experience.
<BR>
<P>Politics as usual.
