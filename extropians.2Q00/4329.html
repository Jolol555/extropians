<P><EM>        &gt;You mean like which way the photon is polarized?
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;It is undetermined, so it is unknown.
</EM><BR>
<P>I mean more than that. It's not that the photon is set at a certain
<BR>
angle and we just don't know what it is, the polarization angle does
<BR>
not exist, or if you prefer, all polarization angles exist until the
<BR>
instant the photon hits the filter.
<BR>
<P><EM>        &gt;Umm...possible error here.  Unless the sequences
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;are of infinite length (which can't be precomputed
</EM><BR>
<P>You're missing the point. I'll be generous, I'll give you infinite sequences with
<BR>
no argument, it won't help you a bit, you still won't be able to make boxes as
<BR>
I have described.
<BR>
<P><EM>        &gt;Another possible error: what if you had 4 boxes[...]
</EM><BR>
<P>You can't just conjure up 4 boxes unless you spell out exactly how
<BR>
they're entangled. In my original specifications I said things like
<BR>
&quot;If one box is set at X then the other box [...]&quot;, if there are only
<BR>
2 boxes then the meaning is clear, if there are 4 boxes then it is not clear.
<BR>
I'm not saying 4 boxes could not be entangled, but the rules describing their
<BR>
behavior would be much more complicated and I doubt it would bring much
<BR>
clarity to the experiment.
<BR>
<P><EM>        &gt;By your logic, 12 has 1/4 difference from 2 has 1/4 difference
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;from 4 has 1/4 difference from 6, and yet 12 has 4/4, not 3/4,
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;difference from 6 at the same time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes but it's not my logic, I don't pretend to understand why things work that
<BR>
way, as Richard Feynman said, nobody understands quantum mechanics.
<BR>
However the universe doesn't care if I think any of this makes sense or
<BR>
not because that's the way things do work, there is absolutely no doubt,
<BR>
and all you need is a filter that moves in 30 degree increments.
