Hal commented on his observations of Collins in the Rose interview.
<BR>
Collins, is I believe one of the better people we could have in
<BR>
his position at this time, since he tries to remain a rational
<BR>
proponent of the advantages that the information will provide
<BR>
to the living.  It is difficult to critique someone for not having
<BR>
a 50 or 100 year vision because even on my good days, I find it
<BR>
difficult to go that far, presumably because of the singularity.
<BR>
<P>Hal's observations are pretty much correct in terms of the
<BR>
consequeces of what the technologies and knowledge will bring.
<BR>
I'm less concerned about issues of &quot;mis-treatment&quot; by insurance
<BR>
companies due to knowledge of genome information because you
<BR>
have to place it in the larger context of 'whether or not
<BR>
it really matters'.  For the individuals who understand the issues,
<BR>
you simply plan to get frozen whether at 40 or 80.  I generally
<BR>
think the people will require the politicians to make misuse of
<BR>
genetic information 'impossible'.  In fact current laws regarding
<BR>
'handicaps' may already exist to provide legal routes for the
<BR>
misuse of medical information.  It is worth noting that at the
<BR>
current time, this is primarily a U.S. issue, and not of concern
<BR>
to individuals on the list who live elsewhere.  On balance, of
<BR>
concern to those individuals, is whether national medical programs
<BR>
will be as progressive about implementing genetic treatments for
<BR>
various conditions.
<BR>
<P>The community of people who recognizes the potential for what is
<BR>
coming and who openly engages in it is small, perhaps at most a
<BR>
few thousand people on the planet.  We stand now at the forefront
<BR>
of the education of the masses as efforts like Kurzweil, Joy,
<BR>
Max &amp; Natasha, and myself in a very limited fashion, as well as
<BR>
others begin to make the light bulb glow a bit brighter.
<BR>
<P>The LifeEx Tech seminar this weekend will be interesting because
<BR>
it will be an intimate meeting where a small group (~15 people)
<BR>
get to interact on a subject of common interest, where about half
<BR>
of the people grok the concepts we regularly deal with and about
<BR>
half of the people are uneducated.  I think it will take hundreds
<BR>
or thousands of such interactions before we get to the stage where
<BR>
people like Dr. Collins begin to grasp the magnitude of wave that
<BR>
is about to crash upon us.
<BR>
<P>Surfs up!
<BR>
Robert
