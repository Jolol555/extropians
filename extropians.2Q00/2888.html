Extropians,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many people remember this post by Sasha to the extropy
<BR>
list back in February?

<EM>&gt; Subject: Extropian finder service?
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Could we create a searchable database of extropians who would like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be found for taking part in various projects - from contracting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for high-tech ventures to just finding people who may be in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certain city at a certain time?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I personally often face these issues, and probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; miss most opportunities because I don't know who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to contact.

</EM><BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many people express an interrest in helping
<BR>
with, and using the results of, such a project since sasha suggested
<BR>
it and I'm still working on getting it organized.  I'd like to see
<BR>
such an extropian membership system set up for the extropian community
<BR>
like Sasha proposed.  I'd like to see this project dedicated to Sasha
<BR>
since it originated with this post of his.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some of my thoughts about what such a system would
<BR>
start out being.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be a &quot;membership&quot; link off of the main
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.extropy.org/">http://www.extropy.org/</A> page.  People could go to this page and after
<BR>
logging in, check their membership status and update their personal
<BR>
information.  This would include information like interrests, areas of
<BR>
expertise, extropian activities completed....  Everyone could specify
<BR>
the level of privacy for all data fields in their own DB file with the
<BR>
following proposed values:
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10      private
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20      Friends
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30      Extropy Advisors
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40      Paid up (active) members Only
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50      Any members
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60      Public
<BR>
<P><P>There would be a search page that would enable people like Sasha to
<BR>
find other extropians based on interrests, location, time....
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could watch the exponential growth of the number of
<BR>
extropian members and activists.  We would have an &quot;exinum&quot; which
<BR>
would more or less be what number joining member you were.  Very low
<BR>
numbers being very prestigious, like sports team numbers.  (By the
<BR>
way, what is Sasha's number?)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be great if we could tie it into Max's
<BR>
extropy membership database so we could check on the status of our ExI
<BR>
dues and donation payments and so on and so forth without having to
<BR>
bug Max or whoever is keeping up that database.  I've created a new
<BR>
membership database on the MySQL system on www.extropy.org with the
<BR>
following table now in it for a start:
<BR>
<P><P><P>CREATE TABLE member (
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;exinum INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;first     CHAR(25),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;middle    CHAR(25),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;last      CHAR(25),
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;address1  CHAR(25),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;address2  CHAR(25),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;city      CHAR(25),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;state     CHAR(25),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;country   CHAR(25),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;postal    CHAR(25),
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;email     CHAR(50),
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;url       VARCHAR(255),
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;userid    CHAR(16),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;password  CHAR(16),
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;joined    DATE
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;);
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you all think?  Any other ideas?
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, this is what I have so far.  This is what I'm working
<BR>
towards.  If anyone else is interrested in helping out with such a
<BR>
project, some jsp programming, html page layout development, or even
<BR>
if only with some suggestions on how better to precede (perhaps there
<BR>
is a better way than MySQL and java server pages?), please notify me.
