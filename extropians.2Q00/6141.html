<EM>&gt; &gt;Brian Manning Delaney is an idiot. In fact, an insulting and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;condescending idiot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Max More and Natasha Vita-More have won the argument.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Did someone say &quot;cultism&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>You and Brian did. It occurs to me that you two could have engineered
<BR>
this whole situaiton in order to 'prove' such an idiotic point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Excellent - we now have a test case for the hypothesis that Extropianism is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a cult.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If Extropianism is *not* a cult, the ethical standard invoked in people's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criticism of Brian will be invoked here: &quot;Eliezer, this is a *vicious* blah
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blah blah ... dot dot dot.....&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If Extropianism *is* a cult, people will not criticize Eliezer for his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comment (and might even feel warm and fuzzy - &quot;CRUCify him&quot; &quot;CRUcify
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him&quot;!!!).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Eliezer is not a 'leader' of any sort, so failing to 'crucify him' does
<BR>
not indicate anything of the sort you'd like to insinuate. Trying to
<BR>
imply that there is absolutely no lack of agreement among the members
<BR>
with things said and done by Max and Natasha, based on one single
<BR>
subject does not a substantiated accusation make. Anyone who has
<BR>
actually spent any amount of time on the list at all, rather than
<BR>
flitting in and out as one's ego desires (as Brian has done), would show
<BR>
to the observer that there is quite a bit of disagreement over many
<BR>
things between members and Max and Natasha.
<BR>
<P>I've 'crucified' Eliezer over other things in the past, but doing so
<BR>
just because you command it strikes me as something without cause or
<BR>
reason. Eliezer has merely told a rude an insulting interloper to get
<BR>
out of the 'meeting hall'. Rudeness in such a situation is entirely
<BR>
called for, and requires no rebuke from us.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PS Eliezer, want to put money on the claim that Brian is an idiot? I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; serious.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll put money down right now. The things he's said on the list indicate
<BR>
to me that he is not playing with a full deck, or is simply 'programmed'
<BR>
badly, like, for instance, as a member of a rather badly constructed
<BR>
cult... hmmmm
