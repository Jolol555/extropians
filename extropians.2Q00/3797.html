<EM>&gt; Don't know if anyone has thought of this, but it occured to me that the cosmic

<EM>&gt; filter may really be a real filter that we imposed on ourselves. The idea is our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continuous broadcasting of radio and video feeds out into the universe is seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the galactic civilization as the equivalent of spam, and that they imposed a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; filter on our solar system to eliminate interference from our signals. Then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; again, maybe we just aren't subbed to the right lists... ;)

<P>Unlikely without causality violation.

<P>Reason: radio transmissions began around 1900 and propagate outwards at
<BR>
the speed of light. Radio astronomy first begins around 1940 (Karl Jansky
<BR>
may have been working a few years before that, but it was the development
<BR>
and military utility of radar that really got the ball rolling).
<BR>
Transmissions powerful enough to pick up at a range of light years didn't
<BR>
really start until the 1930's. 
<BR>
<P>Assuming that people out there are talking, but sent us to coventry because
<BR>
of our incessant spamming, there'd be a real-time lag of about a decade
<BR>
between our first signals loud enough to be picked up, and our first
<BR>
chance to pick up _their_ signals. That means the galactic civilization
<BR>
is entirely concentrated within about five light years of us, or their
<BR>
descendants in the 21st-30000th centuries sent them back a tachyon-gram
<BR>
(directed to the 20th century AD through 29900th century BC) to say
<BR>
&quot;there's a bunch of offensive loud-mouthed primates on the third planet
<BR>
orbiting that G2 star -- don't broadcast in their direction!&quot;
