<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Isn't this merely a call for credentials?  Does anyone think she was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  unacquainted with works of Modern Art?  Or is QueeneMUSE demanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  have an art degree from a prestigious school before opening one's mouth
</EM><BR>
or
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  putting pen to paper?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most explicitly, No!
</EM><BR>
<P>Good.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Degrees are nice to have, they get respect, and yes, people will take you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more seriously, But Ph.D.'s don't hold the patent on the knowledge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Libraries, the Internet, art classes, all good. Many free. But the desire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must be there, and an open willing mind.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you sure Rand didn't avail herself of this?  Her comments and other
<BR>
stuff she wrote seem to betray familiarity with a lot of art work.  (Also,
<BR>
recall, she died in 1982 before she could avail herself of the internet.
<BR>
Yeah, I know technically she could have gotten email back then, but there
<BR>
was no web.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If one is an artist, one SHOULD learn these things. But to critique and
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; sound bilious, one MUST.
</EM><BR>
<P>See above.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  What would have educated her in this regard?  I have a feeling that
</EM><BR>
only
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  adulation and praise would qualify for QueeneMUSE as education.  Prove
</EM><BR>
me
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  wrong!  Please prove me wrong.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tsk Tsk, you have a feeling? ; P .... Daniel, objectivists can't go by
</EM><BR>
their
<BR>
<EM>&gt; FEELINGS, haven't you learned anything from your Goddess? ; ) just
</EM><BR>
kidding...
<BR>
<P>I've no gods or godesses in my pantheon -- just lots and lots of books.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; First of all, let me tell you my name, it is Nadia.
</EM><BR>
<P>I forgot.  I was only using QueeneMUSE because Nadia does not include her
<BR>
name in every post.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No, I don't want her to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; praise Pollock and other 1950's modernist art, in fact she would have like
</EM><BR>
my
<BR>
<EM>&gt; work better, it's figurative realism, and very conservative.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure.  I've lamented elsewhere that most Objectivists do not look
<BR>
at, listen to, read, etc. enough art.  I mean in Rand's case, I've to admit,
<BR>
she was exposed to a lot of it.  However, many of her followers just take
<BR>
her word for it and leave it at that.  (A few do not and explore.  Some of
<BR>
those arrive at the same conclusions she did and others do not.  The
<BR>
Objectivist community is not so monolithic as to march in lockstep over
<BR>
every issue.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Last time I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looked at a Pollock I was sadly disappointed. (Which I'll go into below).
</EM><BR>
<P>Truth be told, I agree with Rand on Pollock, BUT I think Pollock's drip
<BR>
paintings are fun to look at.  I don't get any deep meaning from them, but
<BR>
the illusory effect of wiggling -- I've seem them up close and personal --
<BR>
can be quite exciting.  (I freely admit to viewing many a Modern work --
<BR>
even of revelling in Ligetti's piano music!  See my web page for my tastes.
<BR>
I've not hidden them from this audience or from Objectivists or even from my
<BR>
true love Echelon.  Are you listening, my dear?  I know you are.  I know you
<BR>
are.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What would have qualified her as a valid person to critique ANY sort of
</EM><BR>
art
<BR>
<EM>&gt; would have been simple: *knowing what the standards are* instead of making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; her own and calling them objective. It's kind of like saying: If I don't
</EM><BR>
like
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it, it's shit. Deal with it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Rand did not, as even a cursory reading of _The Romantic Manifesto_ will
<BR>
show, argue that her or anyone's tastes were objective.  In fact, in quite a
<BR>
few places in that work, she is quite strict about delineating esthetic
<BR>
judgment of a work from esthetic reaction to it.  One can, after all, judge
<BR>
something to be a great work of art yet not like it.  Or judge something to
<BR>
be inferior yet love it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There are standards for art education. The main four ones are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VISUAL PERCEPTION:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     This is the ability to see and understand concepts in art. Line,
</EM><BR>
color,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; form, negative space, balance, materials, techniques. such as collage,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; airbrush, trump l'oiel, assemblage, casting, scumbling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What &quot;visual terms&quot; do artists use to express unity, movement, emphasis,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space, and texture, etc.? Visual perception is an ability to recognize the
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; processes that made the art as well as to understand the final composition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and meaning, if any. Artistic perception is learned through comparisons
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; identification of these elements.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't disagree.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; CREATIVE EXPRESSION:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Creating, performing and participating in the arts. Doing art. Developing
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; knowledge and skills in a variety of media. Applied knowledge. This is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most common form of art knowledge. Many here on the list do this part,
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; great success!
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll be the judge of that!:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (For Ayn Rand her media was her writing -- which she mastered brilliantly.
</EM><BR>
To
<BR>
<EM>&gt; my knowledge she never attempted any visual art).
</EM><BR>
<P>She did draw according her comments when she was in school.  But I don't
<BR>
think one must do to judge, else only those who have killed would be able to
<BR>
sentence a murderer.  Only those who cooked would be able to judge a meal.
<BR>
And we'd all have to shut up here about &quot;The Matrix,&quot; since, as far as I
<BR>
know, there are no film directors among us.  (Am I wrong?  If so, please
<BR>
speak.  I've lots of questions about film.:)
<BR>
<P>She also wrote screenplays and worked in Hollywood for a spell.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL CONTENT:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the understanding of contributions of the culture that the art
</EM><BR>
comes
<BR>
<EM>&gt; from, and the history of art before. It looks at what was happening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; historically while art was being made.  What is the content of art in
</EM><BR>
various
<BR>
<EM>&gt; times and periods and locations and cultures throughout the world? What
</EM><BR>
was
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the role of visual arts in human history?
</EM><BR>
<P>A good point.  I don't think Rand overlooked this, though she was no art
<BR>
historian.  I also think she simplified a lot of art history.  In her
<BR>
defense, though, she was writing on esthetics in general and not getting
<BR>
into the minutiae on every aspect of the arts.  This is the work later
<BR>
thinkers -- Peter Saint-Andre, Kirsti Minsaas, Stephen Cox, and the writers
<BR>
of _What Art Is_ -- are now doing.
<BR>
<P>I think Rand's problem was not so much inexperience at all.  Instead, it was
<BR>
a dogged disregard of other points of view.  This does NOT mean other points
<BR>
of view are right.  Heck, most of the time when I get the other person's
<BR>
view on something, I quickly confirm he or she is an ignorant fool.  Still,
<BR>
Rand was almost always dismissive, especially as she got older.  Nor did she
<BR>
seek out criticisms.  (She's not alone in this.  Many thinkers, some of them
<BR>
great, were extremely disliking of all criticism and shielded themselves
<BR>
from it.  The difference, of course, is that many of them have tenure or are
<BR>
part of the Establishment.  From inside, it's easy to ignore critics, but
<BR>
from the outside (and Rand was on the outside; only lately has Objectivism
<BR>
started to penetrate academia) one must be more careful and ever ready to
<BR>
discuss and refine.  i'm not here advocating that established thinkers and
<BR>
movements should act this way.  Just telling it like it is.)
<BR>
<P>I don't want to read too much into this.  After all, the focus should be, as
<BR>
I've mentioned before, on the ideas, especially whether they are valid and
<BR>
whether they lead to any other useful ideas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; AESTHETIC VALUING:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The ability to analyze, interpret and derive meaning from works of visual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; art. Judgments made about and determining the quality of art *in
</EM><BR>
accordance
<BR>
<EM>&gt; with the learned elements and principles at work*.
</EM><BR>
<P>This presupposes acceptance of those principles.  One need also to judge the
<BR>
field from outside itself, much as we judge whether the political system or
<BR>
current laws are just apart from whether a specific person broke a specific
<BR>
law.  For the most part, Rand's esthetics is a different bird from Modernist
<BR>
or Postmodernist esthetics.  In fact, in some ways, in hearkens back to
<BR>
ancient Greek notions of art, especially those of Plato and Aristotle.  (I
<BR>
don't think this is a bad thing.  The Ancients were not a bunch of idiots we
<BR>
can safely ignore merely because they are long dead.)  Even so, it is not
<BR>
merely a pastiche of old Greek views.
<BR>
<P>Moreover to reduce Rand's esthetics merely to its critical role of being
<BR>
against Modern Art is to miss a lot of it.  It's not purely negative -- even
<BR>
just in the dialectical fashion of negating to affirm.  Perhaps we could
<BR>
discuss that here to see what Nadia and others think of her more substantive
<BR>
notions on why we need art and how it affects us.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So you can see:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Adulation and praise have nothing to do with a good crit. Her potshot at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pollacks work was to call it little better than a &quot;drunk vomiting on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sidewalk.&quot; Nice.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't go as far as to say that, though I've seen films of Jackson
<BR>
Pollack at work.  (I've not seen his wife's work, but would like to.)  It
<BR>
makes breaking all the rules look easy -- requiring no talent whatsoever,
<BR>
except, perhaps, making sure some of the paint makes it to the canvas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Again: I see her as emotionally reactive, sneering, derisive and smug ...
</EM><BR>
Vs.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; well balanced, aware, educated, worldly, calm and knowledgeable.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can a person who is &quot;well balanced, aware, educated,&quot; etc. ever react in
<BR>
Nadia's world with revulsion?  Or is such an emotion banned?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hope this cleared it up for you.
</EM><BR>
<P>A little, but from my comments one can see I'm still not in agreement.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I really do think her whole problem was her pathological dislike of
</EM><BR>
anything
<BR>
<EM>&gt; she couldn't control.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think she had that problem, though I don't think it was her dominating
<BR>
vice.  Sadly, toward the end she isolated herself so as not to overcome
<BR>
this.
<BR>
<P>Nadia might also want to read &quot;Interesting Parallels: Kenyon Cox and Ayn
<BR>
Rand on Art&quot;  at <A HREF="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Kenyon.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Kenyon.html</A>  I wrote it
<BR>
about five years ago.  Some of it pertains to the above discussion.  (Need I
<BR>
mention Cox was a painter, teacher, and art critic?)
<BR>
<P>Glory!
