I see a lot of people pointing optimistically to some of the roadkill
<BR>
on the way to the fantasy of being able to hum and hear trumpets. 
<BR>
It's almost all roadkill.  It'll happen eventually, but it will be
<BR>
the result of using on the order of four different &quot;pitch-guessing&quot;
<BR>
processes, and voting.  And to get that to work will require
<BR>
recognizing the instrument used as input.  This is, after all, what a
<BR>
human does.  Our auditory processing is truely remarkable.  The real
<BR>
reason that we haven't solved this problem is that the goal has a
<BR>
large fantasy element--it couldn't be made to work even using magic,
<BR>
unless you somehow hacked the user's perceptions.
<BR>
<P>Assuming that you can build hardware that somehow does discriminate
<BR>
pitch as fast as we do, you have the latency issue that you are now
<BR>
ready to start playing the note that the human audience has already
<BR>
heard from the source (whistle, guitar-string or whatever) and you
<BR>
start late.  You just can't make this work in real time performance
<BR>
situations, even if you can hide the original control signal from the
<BR>
audience.  The control signal matched the timing of the other
<BR>
performers, but the resulting tone is unavoidably late.  Playing solo
<BR>
doesn't solve it either because what you are hearing is the note that
<BR>
you were humming, played as trumpets, not the one that you are trying
<BR>
to hum right now.   The actual note-rate (tempo) that can be
<BR>
accomplished is really slow.
<BR>
<P>I'd love to see a real solution, but I don't think you can get there
<BR>
even with use of EEG.
