<EM>&gt;&quot;I wonder what would happen if you organized a 'party/poster'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conference by just having a very large room with dozens of whiteboards,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and with snacks and chairs distributed throughout.  There would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be no official schedule or map, and you'd spend the whole weekend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wandering about joining whatever discussions or presentations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;formed &quot;spontaneously.&quot;  Any dispute about what a group talked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about in a location would be handled as at a party, with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;option of one group walking away to do what they want somewhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I like this spin on creative brain-storming. In most, criticism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is not permitted or interrupting a person's expression. Every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idea, no matter how frivolous is accepted because these ideas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tend to trigger best solutions.  In your design, the rules, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this regards, would be social skills and common sense, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would include not interrupting or censoring inappropriately.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;We performed a type of creativity session at university where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we had butcher paper on all walls of the room and students were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;given total imagination-stretch to do with the white whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they wanted.  Usually, a person needs some sort of direction,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or theme for the process to get motivated.  This is different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than bringing a type of creative thinker into a room with a specific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scenario to build on, and giving total freedom to create and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exchange ideas.  Considering this, I might participate differently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if I was with you (Robin), Max, Greg, Amara, and Eli than I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;E. Shaun, Fiorella Terenze, Stelarc, Nadia and Francis Ford Copola.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  But then again, maybe not. Both groups are comprised of individuals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whose creativity crosses disciplinary boundaries.  Much of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;outcome depends on the dynamics of the group and communication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;abilitiese.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I like your &quot;party&quot; analogy -:) (I'm visualizing several people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at a coctail party sipping on their drinks moving in groups (of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one or more) to and fro from other groups - depending on whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the conversation is intriguing or a bore.)  I don't think, however,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that I would want to mix a party with a task.  I would, however,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mix a party scene with a performance art piece which would involve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all participants in a task; or create a task session in a party-like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;atmosphere as long as everyone knew.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Eliezer:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;This is an excellent idea and should, at the very least, &gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tried as a 2-hour across-the-board &quot;panel&quot; at the next &gt;Foresight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conference.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Could you explain?  Thanks.
</EM><BR>
<P>There was a very volatile, fertile intellectual atmosphere in libertarian 
<BR>
circles up to the mid-70's at least, in which many of the same ideas that 
<BR>
show up frequently here - including things like uploading, immortality, AI, 
<BR>
etc. - were often subjects of intense discussion.  Then the movement 
<BR>
polarized into Libertarian Party vs. Anti-LP.  Each side began 
<BR>
characterizing the other as fundamentally immoral, evil, or unbelievably 
<BR>
stupid.
<BR>
<P>Then, the free-wheeling discussions began to be taken over by organized 
<BR>
intellectual purity squads - best exemplified by the &quot;New Libertarians&quot; 
<BR>
connected with Sam Konkin and his trigger man enforcer, Neil Shulmann.  If 
<BR>
anyone said anything deviating from the official agorist line, they would be 
<BR>
instantly pounced upon and literally shouted down.  The LP similarly 
<BR>
rejected topics that were not oriented toward strictly political ends.  We 
<BR>
now can see where this got us.
<BR>
<P>Let's try to not repeat mistakes...
