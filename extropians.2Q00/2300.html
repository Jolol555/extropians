<EM>&gt; If I have a micro-camera that I wear all the time (much like the L.A.

<EM>&gt; Sherriffs), and you invite me into your private spaces, is that government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance?  Now say 20% of the population wears the same kind of
</EM><BR>
device.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Heck it becomes so handy to vid-conference with friends and family
</EM><BR>
whenever
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you get the whim, imagine that everyone who now carries a cell phone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everywhere they go, trades in the cell phone for a micro-cell-cam.  Now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone you talk to, everywhere you go is potentially recording
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything you say and do.

<EM>&gt; Looky there Big Brother didn't even have to lift a finger to do it, and
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; can't blame him when every lie you ever tell ends up on America's Funniest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Home Videos!!

<P>You'll note that I recently pointed out that very possibility (well,
<BR>
inevitability, actually) in a recent post.
<BR>
<P>However, this does not get you the 'transparent' society you wanted. It
<BR>
doesn't help the government catch pot smokers, or sexual perverts, or anyone
<BR>
else whos 'crimes' are consensual. Real criminal will not film themselves,
<BR>
and they will break or steal private surveillance systems when they can.
<BR>
Criminal conspiracies won't keep recordings for you either, unless they are
<BR>
especially stupid. The list of wholes in the system goes on and on.
<BR>
<P>Also, there are problems with using the recordings as evidence. Without a
<BR>
central database it takes real effort to figure out who might have a
<BR>
recording you want, find them, find out what they actually have, persuade
<BR>
them to let you see it, figure out if it is real footage or something that
<BR>
was faked up, etc. The net effect is not a transparent society, but simply
<BR>
one in which it is hard to lie convincingly about what you did in public.
