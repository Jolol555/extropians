Robert,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is worth noting that when you grasp the big picture, the efforts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of single individuals are *almost* meaningless.  The trick is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discover the leverage points where a single individual may exert a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small force and cause a large mass to move(*).
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great analogy Robert!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a more well defined and active organization could go a
<BR>
long way.  Max does a huge amount of work trying to push things
<BR>
forward, but, like you said, the efforts of a single individual are
<BR>
almost meaningless.  If many more people would step up to help him out
<BR>
with much more real work his efforts could be amplified thousands of
<BR>
times and more.  He should at least have a support organization that
<BR>
included a large staff, some of who are paid to work full time, to
<BR>
help him do some of the things we're trying to do.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine if there were thousands of us well organized and
<BR>
pushing as hard as Max and a few others.  Imagine if this number of
<BR>
people this actively involved was growing exponentially.  We could
<BR>
work to create societies like &quot;The never say die&quot; society (The
<BR>
equivalent of the American Cancer Society, but for the disease of
<BR>
aging....)  We could work to have another society that would try to do
<BR>
work and raise funds to help poor people that wanted to be cryonically
<BR>
preserved but could not afford it.  Think of organized and well
<BR>
coordinated religions, like the LDS church and all the meaningless
<BR>
work they do in the world.  If we could get 1/10 of this much effort
<BR>
focused on funding cryonic preservation and restoration research I bet
<BR>
we'd have the ability to achieve this after in a few decades....
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a well organized church with aggressive missionaries, I
<BR>
think we should have a very powerful organization working to save
<BR>
everyone possible and pulling everyone into the time when there is no
<BR>
more death.  We need much more than just trim tabs.  We need powerful
<BR>
well organized and dedicated engines that will drive this supper
<BR>
tanker where it is possible for it to go.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, One person can't do a whole lot.  But if we'd organize
<BR>
better and if more people would help out, we could finally overcome
<BR>
death.  The LDS church has more than 50,000 20 year olds that work
<BR>
full time for two years pushing LDS doctrine all over the world.  The
<BR>
LDS church has huge monetary assets - billions of $$$$.  They have
<BR>
legions of dedicated people doing &quot;temple work&quot; or sacred ordinances
<BR>
which they believe will bring them immortal life.  If we had an
<BR>
equivalent set of dedicated organized driving engines using real
<BR>
science instead of hocus pocus &quot;priesthood&quot; we could really do all
<BR>
this don't you think?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once we are immortal, we'll be able to do anything after
<BR>
that right?  True, we can't do it alone, but if we all put our
<BR>
shoulder to the same wheel and work together, I think we can do
<BR>
anything, or at least a heck of a lot more than we are now doing.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent Allsop
