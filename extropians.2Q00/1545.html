<EM>&gt;We hope that (working) immigrants can sustain (by means of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;taxation) our welfare state. Otherwise our welfare state will crash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very soon.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hooray! Let it crash, Italy doesn´t need to import slaves.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I agree, partially.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In my modest opinion &lt;slaves&gt; is too much expressive. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;come spontaneously (and, frequently, illegally) from very poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;countries. But, that’s true, our politicians (from left-side to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right-side) look at those immigrants just as &lt;servants&gt;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now our welfare state is based on the one to one ratio. One
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worker maintains, supports one retired. This system is crashing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because of lifetime extension. Soon this ratio will be one to two, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one to three.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sincerely,
</EM><BR>

<P>Once upon a time, I was an active member of the old PRI (The Italian 
<BR>
Republican Party- NOT similar to the American Republicans). I left them 
<BR>
since they couldn't comprehend that the terms in Italy were rapidly 
<BR>
changing, among other things due to immigration. So what if they come from 
<BR>
poor countries? There are a lot of works to be done in Italy, especially in 
<BR>
the service sector. But, as elsewhere in Europe, the enormous power of the 
<BR>
unions has effectively closed the borders for legal immigration. Even the 
<BR>
internal market for labour in the EU doesn't work. One of the few cases 
<BR>
where it works is for soccer players (but the previous government thought of 
<BR>
stopping even that). It is not only the fact that Italy's population is 
<BR>
getting older that is a problem (as elsewhere in industrialized countries) 
<BR>
but of a very rigid labour market.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
