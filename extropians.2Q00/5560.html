<P>
Terry, would you forward this again please, but not to skeptic,
<BR>
I think they have seen my response to such tiradas a few times. 
<BR>
<P>Eva 
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; Mike LaTorra replies:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you mean countries like Germany? Or Czechoslovakia? Or perhaps Hungary?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or do you restrict your classification of &quot;most advanced&quot; to the USA at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beginning of the 20th century?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>As you know, E. Germany, Czekoslovakia and Hungary had the soviet 
<BR>
type totalitarian system foisted on them via the USSR  army that
<BR>
liberated them from fascism. In the case of Hungary and 
<BR>
Czekoslovakia, they attempted to democratise the system, but 
<BR>
this threatened the US-Soviet status quo, so it was suppressed.
<BR>
But East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary were again, not exactly 
<BR>
those most developed and most democratic of capitalist countries.
<BR>
England, France and the USA and Western Germany was far more
<BR>
advanced, yes.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  If the countries I listed first are acceptable candidates for Marxism,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then clearly the experiment has been tried and failed, but not for lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying. The blood, sweat and tears of numerous unwilling &quot;experimental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subjects&quot; show that the only thing most of them were willing to risk their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lives for was trying to escape from their respective &quot;workers' paradise&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; States.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>You forget about the millions who were fighting to be relieved from 
<BR>
serfdom, from poverty and hoped socialism would bring freedom
<BR>
from it.  Freedom from poverty and illiteracy  should count, too. 
<BR>
You seem to forget about the millions who 
<BR>
emigrated to found the USA - emigrated from European poverty
<BR>
much before they were trying to emigrate from soviet totalitarianism. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;   However, if you think only the USA qualified for Marxism, then please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explain why, when Leon Trotsky visited America, he concluded that it did not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need a revolution. Was he insufficiently Marxist for you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>please let me have the source for this, because I certainly had never
<BR>
heard about it, I suspect a very out-of-context quote here.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Terry:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The failure was not due to &quot;communism&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but to its absence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; LOL! Are you the Pope of Marxism, or do you have some evidence and arguments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to support your pontifications?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Well, I'm afraid, you seem to be rather ignorant about it,
<BR>
I expect you studied a rather one-sided interpretation.
<BR>
Communism is a democratic socialism, where the state
<BR>
becomes non-existent &quot;withering away&quot;.  Did the USSR or any other
<BR>
pseudo-socialist country  demonstrated any such?
<BR>
No. Therefore they were not communist, not even socialist.
<BR>
They were non-capitalist, at the best approximation.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Terry:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So this is the usual ignorant and crappie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strawman propaganda....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, that's certainly the way your statements seem to me. I have made a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thorough study of Soviet Marxism using documents in English and Russian, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although I can fault the Russian Marxists for much, I cannot fault them for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being insufficiently Marxist.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Whether an -individual- was Marxist or not, has nothing to do
<BR>
whether a -system-  succeeded being communist or not.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Terry:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ..and I won't join Forteana
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to put them right...  but Terry - pass this on,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure it is off-topic there, too, but if anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wants a (decent!) argument, you may pass my email
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; address...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>for the rest it is a repetition of the first post.  What do you mean 
<BR>
Marxism in practice? Like stuff that is new and therefore by
<BR>
definition hasn't yet happened? There is  the theory
<BR>
&nbsp;to discuss,  the conditions that were insufficient for 
<BR>
the development of democracy therefore the eventual
<BR>
failure of the system.  
<BR>
<P>You can also look into the analysis of capitalism, and how that is 
<BR>
failing, endangering the whole survival of the human species
<BR>
as due to its economical mechanism it cannot coordinate the 
<BR>
world to distribute resourses in a sane manner or to invest resourses 
<BR>
in a sustainable manner.   Than look into what alternatives there are 
<BR>
to make us a consciously organised intelligent and cooperating
<BR>
species in the interest of survivable and enjoyable lives. 
<BR>
<P><P>Eva
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; Mike:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A decent argument is not what you have given us, but merely in your words
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;the usual ignorant and crappie strawman propaganda&quot; for which Marxists have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become justly famous. If you want to debate the facts of Marxism in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practice, I've got the facts to back up my claims. If you want to debate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Marxist theory, then please don't waste my time because Marxist theory bears
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as little resemblance to reality as cartoon physics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Look, if Marxism is so great, yet it has failed everywhere it has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tried with utterly catastrophic results, then why would any advanced country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to try it? Just to disprove Marx once and for all at an even greater
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost in human misery?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Regards to friends of freedom everywhere,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
