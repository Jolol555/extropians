<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Having kicked about in Extropian and transhuman circles for a while now, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; am clearer in my mind why the transhuman 'gradualist' approach is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficient.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The so-called 'radical' transhumanism is no longer radically futurist - it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is just a philosophical wing of big business and the political mainstream.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is an interesting accusation. As I see it, the goal of much of
<BR>
the transhumanist movement has been just to become mainstream. Being
<BR>
radical has no intrinsic value if you strive to do something
<BR>
practically. If your goal is to be part of a hip, exclusive little
<BR>
group in order to boost your ego, then it makes sense to try to keep
<BR>
apart from the mainstream at all costs. 
<BR>
<P>As for being a philosophical wing of big business, that seems to be a
<BR>
standard accusation these days. We in Aleph were told that we were
<BR>
bought mouthpieces of the biotechnology business - I just wonder where
<BR>
the millions are? :-) In fact, the overall slant among transhumanists
<BR>
seems to be rather anti-corporativists, even if plenty are
<BR>
libertarians or otherwise capitalistic.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With the adoption of the internet on a wide scale and the NASDAQ explosion,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weight of mainstream commercial and media opinion has actually been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;transhuman&quot;, for some time, particularly in the wake of the 2000 millenium
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; build-up.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is actually true - our ideas are diffusing into the mainstream at
<BR>
an accelerating pace. We better keep up with them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So the swifter and more positive, radical, option is to declare yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post- or neohuman at the outset, act as though it were true, and wait for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the changes to happen all by themselves!
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh! I'm a jupiter brain. This easter I'm going to act as if I was a
<BR>
~100 km sphere of diamondoid quantum dot cellular automata, surrounded
<BR>
by a corona of solar collectors and radiators and with a mental
<BR>
capacity a few billon times the whole of humanity (it could have been
<BR>
more, but those posthuman screensavers take a *lot* of memory, even
<BR>
when they are not running). I can think billions of superhuman
<BR>
thoughts at once, weaving together strands of ideas without the least
<BR>
risk of getting confused. I understand all of human history and
<BR>
knowledge just as easily as a human could understand a simple
<BR>
equation.  Hmm, let's start with terraforming Sweden...
