If we took this opportunity to reevaluate, as a society, the moral pros and 
<BR>
cons of invading China, that'd be one thing.  As it is, the whole debate 
<BR>
stems from the simple fact that no elected politician in this day and age 
<BR>
has the moral courage to stand up and say:  &quot;The little child, Elian 
<BR>
Gonzalez, must be sacrificed on the alter of international law.  If we, as a 
<BR>
society, want to reconsider our decision to put peace above innocent 
<BR>
children, then we can do so afterwards.&quot;
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Actually, it has been the political cartoonists that have had the courage to 
<BR>
at least state how the Cuban-american community has been manipulating things 
<BR>
but politicians don't want to stand up to them.
<BR>
<P>Much of our foreign aid to help lessen starvation is actually more of a way 
<BR>
to gain power over third world nations and this has already been discussed 
<BR>
in great detail on the list.  The goal is generally not to topple a local 
<BR>
dictator who abuses his people but to get him to follow American political 
<BR>
and corporate interests and not be an interferance to us.
<BR>
<P>I do think the U.S. tends to do what it wants in regards or inspite of 
<BR>
international law.  We cajole our U.N. allies to go along with things as we 
<BR>
see it.  In Somalia we 'invaded' and look where that got us!  Sometimes 
<BR>
those nations with starving children are filled with less then friendly 
<BR>
adults who would rob and kill whenever given the chance.
<BR>
<P>Our politicians and a weak-minded general took out American armor 
<BR>
prematurely as the pull-out happened 'incrementally' and that left a  ranger 
<BR>
team at the mercy of local gunmen.  Luckily some of our U.N. allies were 
<BR>
able to (late in the game) show up to help.  Of course trouble really began 
<BR>
to start when we started hunting for a local warlord but then doesn't that 
<BR>
go along with the 'invade poor starving nations for their own good to make 
<BR>
sure the kids get fed' strategy? lol!
<BR>
<P>Eliezer, as you pointed out in an earlier post, there are many ways we could 
<BR>
go about influencing these nations without direct conflict to achieve the 
<BR>
goal of really eliminating mass hunger.  But maintaining the status quo 
<BR>
seems to be the priority for now.
<BR>
<P>Despite all the cynicism I very much respect the foreign and American 
<BR>
doctors, nurses and workers in general who risk their lives and health to 
<BR>
serve in third world nations.  So many human lives are saved or enriched 
<BR>
because of them.  Some of the organizations they work for may not make sure 
<BR>
that a large enough percentage of each dollar donated makes it to the field, 
<BR>
but still, for those on the frontlines helping others I bow my head.
<BR>
