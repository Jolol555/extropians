I swore a mighty oath that I'd never get into this sorta thing, but...

<P>Mike, you can't imagine how wildly weird this sort of thing sounds in Oz.
<BR>
How pathologically dangerous the society must have become to permit a
<BR>
rational man like yourself to regard such fears as natural and attitudes as
<BR>
righteous. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So you buy your wife a gun, fine.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is weird too. `You' are as likely to be a woman as a man, if we're
<BR>
talking adults. And in Australia, wives tend to buy their own stuff.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Your kids [...] either weapon, neither of which they can use. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I should bloody well hope not! 
<BR>
<P>An especially worrying aspect of this (dominant?) American mind-set became
<BR>
apparent to us in Oz a few weeks back, when we learned that the NRA were
<BR>
TV-broadcasting ads that straight-out lied through their teeth about the
<BR>
allegedly vile consequences of gun buy-back laws here. 
<BR>
<P>The claims were that we'd gone to the dogs, people were cowering from an
<BR>
increasing assault by armed crims, blah blah. In fact, official crime data
<BR>
showed that things had *improved* in all the salient parameters, as one
<BR>
would expect. 
<BR>
<P>The NRA falsified their statistics in the most blatant fashion. The
<BR>
conservative Aussie govt was so outraged that they threatened to take legal
<BR>
action against the NRA, a step I found astonishing for a right-wing
<BR>
government. I don't know if news of all this reached the States, or just
<BR>
the paid lies.
