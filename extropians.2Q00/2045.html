Predation is a hard problem to solve honorably for all parties concerned, 
<BR>
but I think it is worth trying. Every day, billions of animals die in 
<BR>
suffering and pain as their desperate struggles to escape a predator fail. 
<BR>
Nature is screwed up. It's a bloodthirsty, vicious world. We should be able 
<BR>
to do better.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>According to the theory of evolution, this is part of the process that 
<BR>
maintains the survival of the fittest engine.  Is it really screwed up?  Is 
<BR>
this simply a matter of perspective? lol  But then it could be argued that 
<BR>
pain, disease and early death are 'natural' and yet we don't want it to be 
<BR>
that way.  Considering the mindboggling ways extropians would like to 
<BR>
reengineer the universe, I consider this idea not so outrageous at all.
<BR>
<P>At this point in human history your idea does seem proposterous.  But a 
<BR>
century from now in the utopia that might be, these ideas may appear not 
<BR>
only sensible but a &quot;moral call to action.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Creating &quot;stasis&quot; in the food chain would be quite an accomplishment!  So 
<BR>
genetic engineering would make all predators(including insect and arachnid) 
<BR>
vegetarian?  It would be like the descriptions in the Bible of the 
<BR>
millennial reign of Christ where the &quot;lion lies down with the lamb,&quot; and 
<BR>
doesn't feel like eating him!
<BR>
<P>In terms of humanity &quot;neutering&quot; mother nature, I thought with mature 
<BR>
nanotech immune systems in our bodies, we could basically ignore whatever 
<BR>
vicious killer virus or bacterium the biosphere produced. Because they would 
<BR>
stand no chance against our artificially enhanced armamentarium.  Or could 
<BR>
nature find a way around even that??

As I've said before here, when people started talking about having skin of 
<BR>
solar cells to eliminate the need to eat, that I expect when such people are 
<BR>
created that they'll pretty quickly form a PETOP, the People for the Ethical 
<BR>
Treatment Of Plants. They'll call vegetarians inhumane butchers and 
<BR>
disgusting bloodthirsty immoral barbarians. But thats only because they are 
<BR>
now thinking like plants....
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Let's go one step farther.... With people using anti-bacterial cleansers 
<BR>
everyday, literally trillions of microorganisms are being slaughtered every 
<BR>
minute!!  Something must be done!  Stop disinfecting your home!  Don't touch 
<BR>
that antibiotic!  And don't take any more showers!  Even the tiny germ needs 
<BR>
our love. ;)
