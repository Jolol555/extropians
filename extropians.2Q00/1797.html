<EM>&gt; &gt; I had written about the limits on cryonic storage imposed by

<EM>&gt; &gt; by freezing damage.

<EM>&gt; Mike:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks, Robert. I had not considered the fact that unstable isotopes within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the frozen body would slowly damage surrounding cells. Is carbon-14 believed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be the main culprit?
</EM><BR>
<P>K40 provides slightly more radiation (4400 Bequerels) than C14 (4080
<BR>
Bequerels), but is uniformly distributed at low concentrations in the
<BR>
cells (as K+ ions).  C14 on the other hand is in and around the DNA
<BR>
and has a much more damaging effect when it decays.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Regarding loss of positional information, you indicate that ice damage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should not be an insurrmountable problem because of the small size of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; synaptic and cellular structures which should match up uniquely. But are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these truly unique? Or are there merely very many permutations?
</EM><BR>
<P>My feeling is that they are unique within the possible physical dislocations
<BR>
that could be caused by ice crystals.  Nanobots will be able to trace
<BR>
axon paths and detect synaptic clefts.  Finding the matching surfaces
<BR>
for a fracture across axon or syaptic cleft should not be difficult.
<BR>
You have to consider that antibodies uniquely identify fragments of
<BR>
9-12 amino acids (&lt;&lt; thousand atoms).  Synaptic clefts containing
<BR>
millions of atoms randomly distributed over axon terminals have to
<BR>
present unique &quot;images&quot; whose mirrors can be recognized.  In fact
<BR>
because the genome cannot contain enough information to specify the
<BR>
complete wiring of the brain and because the wiring of the brain
<BR>
is feedback loop dependent on relatively unprecise molecular
<BR>
diffusion and neuronal firing patterns, it is probably impossible
<BR>
to get neuron connection networks that look very much alike at the
<BR>
atomic level.  At the higher level (e.g. motor neuron wiring) there
<BR>
probably are patterns with small individual variations.  That bodes
<BR>
well for cryonics since even if the pattern is disrupted entirely,
<BR>
an system with enough information should be able to re-wire you
<BR>
a set of working motor functions.  The real crux of the matter
<BR>
is how distributed and redundant &quot;you&quot; are throughout your brain,
<BR>
which will determine the degree to which local rewiring failures
<BR>
that are not &quot;general&quot; can be tolerated.
<BR>
<P>But, IMO, I'd be much more concerned with whether the singularity
<BR>
will have made reanimation of pre-S cryonics patients &quot;irrelevant&quot;
<BR>
than I would with whether or not the technology will be up to the task.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps like snowflakes, there are huge numbers of different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configurations, but there is still some duplication because of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the still larger number of instances.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since the initial wiring occurs by randomly diffusing molecular
<BR>
&quot;attractants&quot; and not by hard coded positional information, I
<BR>
suspect there is a lot of variation.  I believe that Finch and
<BR>
Kirkwood have proposed that much of the variation one sees in
<BR>
longevity is due to differnces in stochastic developmental processes.
<BR>
If true, that would argue there is a lot of inter-individual and
<BR>
local structural variation in brain structures as well.
