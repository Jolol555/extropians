<EM>&gt; &gt; Modern democracies are just a degenerate form of the monarchial system?  For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reasons stated above I would have to disagree.  I can see some connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but not the wholesale link you do.  I appreciate having the vast power one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; man used to have as king being spread around with various branches of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government that are limited by checks and balances.  And we can try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; influence or change things without being hung or imprisoned if the king
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; really dislikes the idea.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Charlie still lives under a system where the head of state IS in fact a monarch,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and his system has no written constitution that recognises that all rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; originate in the individual, who delegates them to the government. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Not quite correct.
<BR>
<P>There _is_ a constitution in the UK; it's just that instead of being
<BR>
written in one single piece of paper, it's written in a number of
<BR>
different places. For example, as of last year there's a Bill of Rights
<BR>
that overrides all other legislation. (Yeah, I know it's disgraceful that
<BR>
it took them that long to implement one, but at least it's there now!) 
<BR>
<P>A secondary consideration is that the UK constitution is less well defined,
<BR>
and therefore easier to change, than the US one. Passing the bill of rights
<BR>
was a routine legislative act; ditto abolishing the voting powers of the
<BR>
hereditary peers in the House of Lords. This is, IMO, a Bad Thing, and a 
<BR>
good reason for supporting Charter 88 (the campaign for a written 
<BR>
constitution that overrides ordinary legislation and has a separate
<BR>
amendment process).
<BR>
<P>However, it'd be a mistake to think that the UK is, *in practice*, a
<BR>
Monarchy. Theoretically, Lizzie Saxe-Coburg-Gotha has the power to tell
<BR>
Tony Blair to go fuck himself. In practice, the first time she did it
<BR>
would be the last -- and Tony would still be in Number 10 Downing Street
<BR>
when the dust settled. The royal family is so far divorced from the
<BR>
legal entity that is The Crown that they don't actually control it any
<BR>
more -- arguably, they haven't since 1832.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I do think I understand your point as being that ultimately, the federal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gov'ts of even democracies still have incredible power over the citizenry,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; even if it is generally more fairly used.  And we are expected as citizens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to be generally loyal subjects to not a king anymore, but our flag and p.m.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or president.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In which I agree with Charlie is totally wrong. The Constitution is the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing that deserves or gets my loyalty.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
That wasn't really my point, anyway. My point was that the power structures
<BR>
that replaced the authoritarian monarchs may have notionally derived their
<BR>
authority from the people rather than &quot;because God _said_ I was better than
<BR>
you peasants&quot;, but *it's still a power structure*, with many of the same
<BR>
attributes and relationships to the outside world.
