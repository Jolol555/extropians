<EM>&gt;I really can't even express how hurtful and mean that is. ...

<EM>&gt;I find this so statement so EMPTY headed, nasty, sexist, bigoted,

<EM>&gt;Interesting how the belief that the body and its cravings must be repressed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has so permeated the Western societies, even among the Extropians. ...

<P>Natasha Vita-More wrote (sarcastically):
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I like the guys who rev-up their engines ... grunt really, really loud.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;... really hot guys ... Don't matter to me if they like politics and stuff.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bonnie cheered:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Woo Hoo!  Thanks, Natasha, for the best laugh I've had all day!
</EM><BR>
<P><P>This has been a fascinating exchange, divided so far exactly on gender lines.
<BR>
The women are appalled, and the men don't see what the problem is.  Here is
<BR>
my (admittedly male) interpretation of the positions:
<BR>
<P>Men: &quot;I hear that you say you are offended, but that shouldn't count until
<BR>
you can articulate more specific complaints.  What is the problem with
<BR>
saying what we all know is true, that men seek physically attractive women?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Women: &quot;We shouldn't have to explain; if you cared about us the fact that
<BR>
we are offended should be enough.  Surely you know that it is considered
<BR>
offensive in our society for men to publicly imply that many women are not
<BR>
up to their standards, especially physically.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Men: &quot;But women commonly and publicly say that most men are not up
<BR>
to their standards of success, wit, aesthetics, intelligence, etc.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Women: &quot;Yes, of course, it is admirable to publicly admire people for
<BR>
these qualities.  But it is terrible to publicly reject ugly women.
<BR>
Enough!  If you ever want sex again you'll stop talking about this.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Men (to themselves): &quot;But this is biased toward the qualities that women
<BR>
tend more to admire, relative to those that men tend more to admire.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Evolutionary Psychologist: &quot;Yes, but that makes sense because the
<BR>
evolutionary function of conversation was more for men to woo women
<BR>
than women to woo men.  Conversation is more about men showing they
<BR>
have qualities that women admire, and that they aren't just trying to
<BR>
bed any women they can. (See Miller's `The Mating Mind').&quot;
