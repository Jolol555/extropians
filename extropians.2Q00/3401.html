<P>[jkc:] 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I can form conclusions based on that. I conclude that the concept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;The Original&quot; is trivial, dull, and utterly useless.
</EM><BR>
<P>No it isn't. It will be ABSOLUTELY interesting to me (whatever my
<BR>
orgins, including having stepped out a tranporter previously) at the 
<BR>
time when *I* (this instance of me, if you like) go to step into the
<BR>
transporter. This instance of me would like to know that this
<BR>
instance of me will step out of the other end. 
<BR>
&nbsp;I don't mean to say that every instance isn't just as much of a
<BR>
venerable human being, etc, just maybe not the same instance of me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;If you don't like this, I assume it is  because you don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accept the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;zygote as being &quot;Harvey&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh it might have a weak claim to the Harvey title but certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unique, others would have a stronger claim to the throne.  
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;That instance of Mr Newstrom will have a stronger claim when it's
<BR>
developed into a conscious extropian, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; I assume this is because you (reasonably) value the sense of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; identity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bingo.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;and don't believe that the zygote would be capable of this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, probably not. But that isn't so much the point of this
<BR>
discussion, as I see it. It's more to do with the results of copying
<BR>
on someone who *has* developed consciousness. The zygote issue only
<BR>
arose as a reductio ad absurdum AFAIK.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;BUT the said zygote would (if it were lucky) grow up to be a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conscious Harvey.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And the zygote might grow up and have conscious grandchildren, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not conscious now and neither is the zygote.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;The continuity of the space-time line seems to me to be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;reasonable standard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The space-time line of what? Yesterday's potatoes that's what,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what you're made of.
</EM><BR>
<P>Come on, I've been around as some kind of conscious assemblage for
<BR>
a fair number of years, irrespective of what I took into myself at
<BR>
lunch yesterday.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;The copies may well have consciousness and continiuty of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *memories* with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;the original they came from, and value their sense of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; identity/consciousness,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;This still doesn't mean that they ARE the original.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't want to be &quot;The Original&quot;, I don't want to be like that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stupid zygote.
</EM><BR>
<P>The &quot;copy&quot; of the zygote will be another zygote, if your pattern
<BR>
buffer is working! I assume you would want to be the actual you, when
<BR>
you emerged from the process. (Ouch it's so hard to avoid
<BR>
circularity).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;Yes but the pattern of the ensemble is reasonably constant,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The difference between a zygote and the fellow writing this post
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather large to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>But the changes are gradual. There is continuity of experience even
<BR>
as we change, no? This is what I trying to say with the space-time
<BR>
line idea. There is continuity in time and spatial location in the
<BR>
ordinary course of events. No instantaeous hops for macroscopic
<BR>
entities anyway.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and the  majority of atoms will remain at each stage for what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it's worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the first place that depends on the arbitrary definition of how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;each stage&quot; is, so the statement is not useful. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Touche'
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implies that there are special John Clark hydrogen atoms and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; special
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Harvey Newstrom hydrogen atoms which renders the statement silly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Over a long enough time, of course that would be silly.
<BR>
But the transportation process is assumed to be just about
<BR>
instantaneous (a la Star Trek), or at least to involve some kind of
<BR>
stasis so that scanning can take place? Ther would not be a wholesale
<BR>
<P>substitution of atoms in an instant.
