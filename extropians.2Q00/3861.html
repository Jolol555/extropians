&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NON-GUNSHOT CAUSE OF KEY WACO-FLIR FLASHES DISCOVERED
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vector Data Systems report made no effort to explain
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how multiple rapid flashes several times per second could
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occur in fixed locations on the ground as seen in the 1993
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waco FLIR tape, which multiple experts say are gunshots.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I proposed this rapid-flash reflection machine
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a non-gunshot causal theory for those rapid flashes:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir07.gif">http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir07.gif</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir03.htm">http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir03.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That reflection machine rapidly vibrates a 1 by 3 foot
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reflective panel up and down several times per second,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simulating key flash sequences on the 1993 Waco FLIR. It
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;isn't likely that such a machine rested next to Mt Carmel!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after proposing that reflective machine I realized
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a far more probable causal hypothesis for the rapid flashes:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the reflective panel isn't being vibrated by a machine, but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the free gale-force winds blowing through the scene that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day, and thus the panel is flapping like a flag in the wind.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypothetical scenario: an infrared-reflecting surface like
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mylar is attached to a board and a loose edge is flapping
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the wind with a cyclic &quot;flap rate&quot; identical to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cyclic rate of key flashes on the Waco FLIR. The flapping
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reflective surface produces a rapid series of flashes in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one fixed location as seen by the FLIR camera, resolving
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rapid-flash problem without a machine or a machinegun.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My plan was to acquire mylar and staple a segment edge to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a board with a strong fan on it and see if I might be able
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to film it causing rapid flashes of visible light (and thus
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presumably also of IR radiation). However, that's no longer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary: I just acquired the best version of the 1993 Waco
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FLIR I've ever seen, it's dramatically better than the copy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've had. To my complete astonishment, on the better copy a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flapping panel about 1 by 3 feet attached to a fallen-down
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;portion of gym wall is visible IN THE EXACT LOCATION THAT
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE MOST INFAMOUS SERIES OF FLASHES OCCUR AS THE FIRE STARTS!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flash series is emphasized by Dr. Edward Allard in both
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Waco: The Rules of Engagement&quot; and &quot;Waco: A New Revelation.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flapping panel in the same location as those key
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flashes also produces flashes at other times during the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hour before the fire. So it's clear to me that there's a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flapping panel attached to a fallen board that creates an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illusion of machinegun-fire as its moving surface causes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a beam of reflected infrared energy to pass repeatedly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over the FLIR sensor, just like the panel on the reflection
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine I proposed <A HREF="http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir07.gif">http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir07.gif</A> ,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except the panel next to Mt Carmel was powered by the wind.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of this flapping panel, or perhaps a segment
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of mylar, is not mentioned in the Vector Data report, which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made no effort to explain the critical factor of the rapid,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machinegun-like nature of the flashes on the 1993 Waco FLIR.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've come to the sobering conclusion, after analysis of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) a newly-acquired 1993 Waco FLIR video, (2) gunshots
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seen in the Somalia FLIR shown on &quot;Waco: A New Revelation&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and (3) the Vector Data Report, that ALL of the flashes in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question on the 1993 Waco FLIR can be shown to be or to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most-probably be solar reflections, contradicting both my
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;previously stated position and the conclusions of infrared
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experts that the gunshot theory has rested on. I'll shortly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;publish an illustrated webpage explaining this conclusion,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is supported in large by facts not covered in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vector Data report, and thus shall not be repetitive, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall address key FLIR issues of concern to Waco watchers.
