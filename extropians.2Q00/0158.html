<EM>&gt; &gt; When I was younger I actually thought the road to posthumanity was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; removing the brain, keeping it alive and connecting it to intelligence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; amplification and telepresence systems. This was largely based on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; erroneous idea that the brain itself doesn't age, so this would also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be immortality. Then I read Hans Moravec and became an uploader... :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Uploading isn't enough, either.  Do you think the mind doesn't age?
</EM><BR>
<P>The mind certainly ages too, but not in the directly entropic manner
<BR>
as a biological brain does - losing receptors, accumulating junk
<BR>
proteins, possibly going Parkinsonian and so on.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I would be astonished to find that an unmodified human mind could last a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mere thousand years (subjective) before crystallizing into senility,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overloading memory space, losing associational mechanisms, or just plain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; falling apart at the seams.
</EM><BR>
<P>The real problem here is the plasticity-stability dilemma of memory
<BR>
(incidentally very close to my research area - what a coincidence!
<BR>
:-). If you have a plastic brain it will learn well and adapt over
<BR>
time, but old information will be lost - after long enough time you
<BR>
will not be you. If it becomes less plastic (as our brains are
<BR>
currently apparently doing) it will eventually become overloaded or
<BR>
static and stop working well.
<BR>
<P>It is not obvious how mental plasticity is changed psychologically and
<BR>
biologically; there is definitely a biological component uploading can
<BR>
fairly easily fix (and then you can set your own baseline plasticity),
<BR>
but the psychological aspect is less understood. Most likely there are
<BR>
mental requirements for indefinite lifespans, and they might be quite
<BR>
strict. Just being uploaded is not enough for immortality, that is
<BR>
likely sure.
<BR>
<P>There is really no way of avoiding eventual &quot;death forward&quot; since even
<BR>
if you keep your mind flexible and healthy it will have to change over
<BR>
time and will eventually have become so different that little of the
<BR>
original remains. 
<BR>
<P>If your &quot;memory/self size&quot; does not grow you will eventually get
<BR>
caught in a loop or have to forget stuff to survive (not necessarily
<BR>
everything, you could always keep an unchanging core and change
<BR>
everything else). If you grow, then the original self will eventually
<BR>
become arbitrarily small compared to the rest of you. The slowest rate
<BR>
that does not lead to recurrence in the long run is logarithmical in
<BR>
subjective time (imagine a counter counting up).
