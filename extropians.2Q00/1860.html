<EM>&gt; CNet has an interview with Kevin Mitnick at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1781398.html?tag=st.ne.1002.thed.1005-200-1781398">http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1781398.html?tag=st.ne.1002.thed.1005-200-1781398</A>.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here, an important new piece of information comes out which suggests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the actions to restrict Mitnick's speaking engagements is in fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based on terms which he agreed to for his probation:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Q: Why do you think they've given you this prohibition?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    A: The conditions of my probation are that I couldn't act as computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    consultant or advisor, and the probation department is interpreting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    that to be that I'm not allowed to speak or write about technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Earlier the only provision mentioned from his agreement was that he could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not use computer technology, and it was hard to see how making money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speaking about computers would fall under that prohibition.  But if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mitnick also agreed not to act as a computer consultant or advisor,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then I think it is very reasonable to interpret that to preclude his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speaking about computer issues for a fee.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My guess is that the purpose of this provision is to restrict Mitnick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from profiting due to his notoriety as a hacker.  Otherwise there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; danger that he could become a role model, which might encourage others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to try to emulate his celebrity by commiting computer crimes of their own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mitnick's probation lasts for three years.  After that he has all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rights and privileges of any other convicted felon.  But until then he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is under close judicial supervision.  Probation is granted in place of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jail time.  It's sort of a halfway condition.  Even though Mitnick is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; walking around freely, he doesn't have the rights of a free man.
</EM><BR>
<P>So he has to get a job bagging groceries, oops they use computers.
<BR>
He can get a job digging ditches, oops, they use computers now too.
<BR>
He could get a job as a janitor, oops, most buildings are computerized,
<BR>
and even the punch clock everybody uses these days is a computer, so
<BR>
punching his 'time card' would constitute 'operating a computer'.
<BR>
I suppose he could go work with the illegal immigrants picking lettuce
<BR>
for three years, I don't know if they've computerized those jobs yet...
<BR>
<P>There is very little that one can do in life these days that doesn't
<BR>
require the use of a computer at some point in time. They might as well
<BR>
have asked him to curl up and die (i'll bet he even has to use a
<BR>
computer to go on welfare now), I'm sure they are hoping he'll do just
<BR>
that. In the meantime, there are a number of technology people that are
<BR>
simply sending him money and stuff to help him out. If you are
<BR>
interested in supporting the private welfare effort of Kevin Mitnick,
<BR>
America's number one non-person, go to <A HREF="http://www.2600.com">http://www.2600.com</A> and go to the
