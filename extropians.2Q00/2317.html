<EM> &gt; Killing a sentient being, whether an identical twin, an exact replica of you 
</EM><BR>
<P>An exact replica of you (you do realize what that means, don't you?)
<BR>
is you. This means, there are two instances of you, both being in the
<BR>
exact the same state. As long as they don't bifurcate, I don't see why
<BR>
you can't delete one of them.
<BR>
<P>The only objectionable point here is that by doing so, you devoid one
<BR>
of the clones from a future possibility of bifurcation, and subsequent
<BR>
divergence, and hence from becoming an individual being.
<BR>
<P>Terminating a fully synched self clone is imo less than a murder. It
<BR>
is very much like an abortion, because it prevents a potential human
<BR>
being from being created. Current society is quite divided on the
<BR>
ethics of the matter.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; or even a sentient computer, should be a crime.  If it is sentient (and 
</EM><BR>
<P>Terminating an unique sentient being, regardless of the substrate, is
<BR>
certainly not a nice thing to do.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; perhaps even if it is not) it has rights, first and foremost to life.  I 
</EM><BR>
<P>Rather, the act of killing it now will come back to haunt you later
<BR>
with a nontrivial probability. (I don't really understand this
<BR>
&quot;rights&quot; thing, it is just another meaningless abstraction).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; realize the thrust of your post wasn't exactly &quot;when is it OK to murder a 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; sentient being?&quot;  But you did seem to believe its OK for you to do away with 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; an intelligent being, so long as the intelligent being is an exact replica 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of you.  Those on the list who feel that way, may want to try putting 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; themselves in the shoes of the replica and imagining how they'd feel about 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; such a policy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Heck, you are your clone. The clone is you. The act of knowing it
<BR>
changes nothing. You can't tell the clone whether it is going to be
<BR>
terminated, or not, because the act of telling would cause a
<BR>
bifurcation. So you don't know whether you or not-you is going to meet
<BR>
the /dev/null in the sky. Even better, you don't have a 50% chance of
<BR>
dying, because no one dies as long as one copy of the clone crowd is
<BR>
still present. There is no difference between you both. Both state
<BR>
space trajectories overlap perfectly. If one clone is terminated, the
<BR>
trajectory still continues.
<BR>
<P>The whole discussion is about as meaningless as whether it is better
<BR>
to be dead, or alive. The comparision is invalid, because death is a
<BR>
non-state. If there's no you, you can't decide.
<BR>
<P>Monkey business. Playing with words. Getting trapped in mental
<BR>
states. A new iteration of Achilles/tortoise pseudo-dilemma.
