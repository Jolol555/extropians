<EM>&gt; &gt; I tend to lurk more than post here, but if I were to try to sum up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; extropian values in one sentence, it would be this: to create and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; harness technology for the purpose of extending the length and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; improving the quality of human life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That seems to be a noble and practical goal, until one delves deeper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and asks: why?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The answer is obvious, and can be expressed by saying the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thing in even simpler language: we want to live long, healthy and happy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps.  There may also be other reasons.  For instance, there may well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be people who want life extension and such available to others, but who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fully intend to commit suicide once that goal is accomplished - i.e.,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they want to create an extropian future, they'd just rather not live in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it themselves for whatever reason.  They would still be extropians, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rest of us would benefit from their (finite) contribution just the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just to be pedantic, no they would not be extropians. If an extropian
<BR>
is someone who lives their life according to the principles, then
<BR>
anyone killing themselves on purpose (accidental deaths during risky
<BR>
behaviors are another subject...) cannot (by the first principle) be
<BR>
an extropian.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You must also face the sobering fact that you may simply die before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; life extension techniques become available.  If that's the case,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hedging your bets and living life to it's fullest NOW (keeping a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; watchful eye on, and hopefully supporting, extropian values) is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; certainly in line with being extropian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps.  But merely living life to its fullest *without taking even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such minimal action as making reservations for life-insurance-funded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cryo* (unless you sincerely believe that life extension will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available to you before you would need cryo, sufficient that you will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never need cryo) disagrees with most definitions of extropy that I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heard.  Giving only moral support is also termed &quot;lip service&quot;, and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; known as a way to claim to be - and perhaps even honestly believe one is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or delude oneself into thinking one is) - supporting something when one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not, in fact, supporting it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This seems, in general, to be one of the problems with new ideas like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those we discuss here: people believe in them, and believe that their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; belief by itself will cause the ideas to become reality (perhaps by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting them to randomly mention it to someone who can do something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about it and would support the idea, without seeking said person out).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If only such were true...  &lt;depressed sigh&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is what I have been trying to get at in my other recent posts.
<BR>
Thanks for laying it out.
