When religion was brought up however I felt I had to respond, it being a theme rather near and dear to my heart. Officially I am a Reverend within the Church of Discord and, to my knowlege, am recognized as such by the State. (my official title is Chaplain of the Legion of Dynamic Discord and Episkopos of the Order of the Sleepless (k)Nights). It appears many people on this lists would describe themselves as atheists and are quite proud of it. In an attempt to offer some balance I will argue for pseudo religion.

<P>I recently put my name down in the book of souls that the Church of Mez has(saw Ziana there). lol  I was fascinated as I poured over their website and read how they made transhumanism very fun(not too say Extropians don't..)!  I would enjoy attending a Burning Man(I think?).

<P>They need to nominate some nonmembers to sainthood.  Who would they nominate...  Saints Drexler and Merkle, no question. ;)

All of them[religions] are True in the sense that they can allow one to relate to Divinity.

<P>Ronin, what do you mean by &quot;relating to Divinity?&quot;  Do you mean humans reaching out to a real divine entity or a &quot;finding god within yourself&quot; thing?  I'm stumped on this one...
