<EM>&gt; There is not even any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real debate about what such a process would do: everyone knows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly what the result of such a copying process would likely do,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how each thing would likely feel and behave; there simply aren't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any interesting facts in controversy here.
</EM><BR>
<P>J. Goard replies:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Hell, yes, there are.  If I'm facing a choice whether to be copied, should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I expect this self-awareness to continue in the original?  Or continue in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either the original or the copy, with a 50% probability of each?  If I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; facing a choice whether to step into the (Star Trek) transporter, then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first possibility above would mean that my self-awareness would cease 100%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the time, and the second possibility would mean that my self-awareness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would cease 50% of the time.  Neither of which sound very appealing to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The end of my self-awareness, my sense of ego, is what I call &quot;death&quot;, nor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is this merely a semantic matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>But this is not a factual matter, in that there is no experiment you can do
<BR>
which would settle it.
<BR>
<P>If you do step into the transporter, you will agree that someone
<BR>
steps out.  He has all of your memories, experiences, habits, and so on.
<BR>
To him, it will feel like the transporter &quot;worked&quot; and did not eliminate
<BR>
his self awareness.  So this experiment will not answer the question for
<BR>
him.
<BR>
<P>And it will not answer the question for the body which steps into the
<BR>
transporter, because it's not around any more.
<BR>
<P>The issue is whether you want to call the guy who steps out &quot;the same
<BR>
person&quot; as the one who stepped in.  It's a semantic question independent
<BR>
of any factual issues, as far as I can see.
<BR>
<P>Can you suggest any experiments, at the end of which you can say whether
<BR>
copies preserve the self-awareness of the original?
