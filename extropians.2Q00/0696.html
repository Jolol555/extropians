<EM>&gt; I did some calcs on this today.  Looks to me like the vacuum dirigible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; notion doesnt work out.  If one uses only idealized assumptions regarding

<EM>&gt; the strength of materials, and assumes assembling a spherical vacuum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ship on orbit, ignoring how to lower the thing into the atmosphere, etc,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then one sees that the mass of the atmosphere displaced increases as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cube of the linear dimension, but the mass of the sphere also increases
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as the cube, since the surface area increases as the square of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diameter and the thickness increases proportional to the diameter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Looks to me that even assuming a hollow diamond sphere, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still arent in the vacuum dirigible business.  Dammit.  {8-[  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>For a strictly uniform sphere, perhaps.  But if you get the walls
<BR>
thick enough that the can withstand a few atmospheres' difference
<BR>
between outside and inside, the only thing left as you go up in size is
<BR>
structural stability...and maybe one could find a way to do that which
<BR>
does not go up in mass as a product of surface area times sphere
<BR>
diameter?

<EM>&gt; I have a question for you two. I assume you are going at it from the angle of one big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bag. What about some sort of foam or honeycombed type structure, with lots of really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really small chambers?
</EM><BR>
<P>Each chamber would have to float (or, at least, be within 1/2 bouyancy
<BR>
of being able to float, assuming that adjacent chambers sharing walls
<BR>
reduces overall mass by about 1/2).  A really small chamber would
<BR>
displace a really small amount of air, so it could only have a really
<BR>
small amount of mass - probably not enough to contain vacuum even in its
<BR>
own volume (though I would love to be proved wrong here).
