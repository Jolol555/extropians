<EM>&gt;     I have to admit I never expected to see anyone trash Mother Teresa.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who's next Gandhi?  MLK?  Your right about one thing and that is that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speaking poorly of Mother Teresa does carry a stigmatism with it.  It's will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; usually get you the same reaction as saying the Holocaust never existed.  At 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first I thought you must be speaking tongue in cheek but as I read on I found 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you were being quite serious and of course I found this quite 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discouraging.  I feel privileged to have lived in a time when she did live 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and gave so freely of herself because if I did not I would think that she 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were someone that people had made up as a modern day myth or legend.  Her 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example has made me demand much more of myself and my life and what I do with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.  It's people like her that make me stop what I'm doing and take a good 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look a my value system and think about what I'm doing with my life.  I'm not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attacking you about your opinion I just don't get it.  The woman took what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; she knew and did the best she could with it.  Not too many people could leave 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sort of impact that she left in the world, not in a positive way. 
</EM><BR>
<P>What impact?  The idea that one should give up what might have been a
<BR>
productive, valuable, society-enriching life to instead preach acceptance
<BR>
of death, that most hideous of all evils, and justify it by belief in God,
<BR>
that most dangerous of beliefs.  I certainly don't hold her as any kind of
<BR>
example except bad, and I'm surprized you're surprized one would say so.
<BR>
<P>If you want to show true compassion to the dying, /do something/ about
<BR>
death itself.  Preach defiance, not acceptance.  Preach science and
<BR>
medicine, not mystical nonsense.  Use your talents to earn money to
<BR>
build the economy to fund that science and find those cures.
<BR>
<P>In case you haven't noticed, we're /all/ dying.  I, for one, don't want
<BR>
sympathy--I want an alternative.  Anyone who makes death seem any less
<BR>
tragic and wasteful and evil than it is will get no respect from me.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
