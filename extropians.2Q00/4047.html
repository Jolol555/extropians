</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;not sure if Natasha thinks they are, but I'd like to hear her comments on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;what she thinks is salvageable from Rand's esthetics per se.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The subject of aesthetics would be good to discuss at some point, but
</EM><BR>
under
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a different thread.  My interest in this thread has waned -- not because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you didn't bring up an interesting subject, but because if we are going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discuss art criticism, I'd rather discuss the ideas of art critics, such
</EM><BR>
as
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Susan Sontag and Robert Atkins.
</EM><BR>
<P>After hearing Sontag's dismissal of Leni Riefenstahl, I'm almost inclined to
<BR>
dismiss her.:)  Almost that is.  I'm game.  What do Sontag and Atkins have
<BR>
to add here?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I expect Natasha here to contend that art _is_ outside identity or
</EM><BR>
invents
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;its identity...:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not sure where you picked up.
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't.  I was just making a guess.  Still haven't read Natasha's book, so
<BR>
I should probably not try to divine too much from what I've read of her
<BR>
stuff here.  My bad.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I find that it is difficult to separate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; art from the artist when considering motivation and/or theory.  It seems
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be my practice to link art with the artist (surely in filmmaking, music,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; visual arts, literature, poetry, etc.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't entirely disagree with this, though I'm sure Natasha is aware of the
<BR>
&quot;intentional fallacy.&quot;  I'm not sure if I agree completely that it is a
<BR>
fallacy, though, in many cases, one can't know much about the artist if
<BR>
anything at all.  How much, e.g., do we know about Homer?  Certainly,
<BR>
understanding and even enjoyment is enhanced when more is known.
<BR>
<P>Rand uses the artist's theme as a way of measuring the work -- by how well
<BR>
the theme is concretized in the work.  (Note: this type of measurement would
<BR>
still be salvagable even if you disagree with the rest of her esthetics.)
<BR>
See page 42 of her _The Romantic Manifesto_.  This would in many cases NOT
<BR>
depend on knowing the artist's intentions if the theme can be discerned from
<BR>
the work itself.  (She seems to believe such is possible as she rattles off
<BR>
what she believes is the themes of various artists.)
<BR>
<P>Later!
