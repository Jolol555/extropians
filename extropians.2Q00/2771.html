<EM>&gt; &gt; The really big thing was that the winnings were untaxed in any way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Apparently gambling winnings in the U.S. by a foreigner do not (or at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the time did not) subject you to U.S. taxes, and Australia (like many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; former British Commonwealth countries) has no tax on gambling.  So the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consortium would just pocket the profits.  After they walked away with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; many millions from (I think) Tennessee there were rumors that either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the U.S. or Tennessee might start imposing a special tax on winnings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for people who cover more than some large fraction of the lottery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; numbers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is always a tax. Capital gains taxes are assessed on businesses,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and income taxes on individuals. The operatives the company was sending
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around to buy tickets had to either be residents or have green cards, in
</EM><BR>
<P>Cannot tourists participate in the U.S. state lotteries?  Anyway,
<BR>
assume the operatives were U.S. citizens.  If they bought the tickets
<BR>
with money belonging to foreign nationals on behalf of foreign
<BR>
nationals and delivered the tickets to the foreign consortium before
<BR>
the drawing for face value plus their service charge, the
<BR>
U.S. residents/citizens made no money on the lottery, (except what
<BR>
they were paid for their services, which clearly they must pay income
<BR>
tax on) and thus owe no tax on the winnings.  The foreign consortium
<BR>
was not operating a business as far as Australia is concerned, just
<BR>
gambling.  I believe at the time the U.S. tax code did not require
<BR>
Australians who place bets on U.S. lotteries to pay capital gains
<BR>
taxes to the U.S., but rather to pay them to their home country (at
<BR>
least from what I recall in the Time or Newsweek article).  Of course
<BR>
Australia had no capital gains tax on gambling winnings.
<BR>
<P>I searched the web for clarity on this issue.  What I found concerns a
<BR>
treaty protocol between the U.S. and Canada -- Australia may be
<BR>
different.  I found this:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.grasmick.com/taxv11n3.htm#NEW">http://www.grasmick.com/taxv11n3.htm#NEW</A> RULES FOR U.S.
<BR>
<P>It appears that the U.S. as of 1996 levies a 30% &quot;withholding&quot; tax on
<BR>
certain gambling winnings by Canadians:
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.grasmick.com/taxv11n3.htm#NEW">http://www.grasmick.com/taxv11n3.htm#NEW</A> RULES FOR U.S.), but that
<BR>
Canadians may be entitled to a partial refund if they file a U.S. tax
<BR>
return.  I believe at the time (around 1990) there was no such
<BR>
withholding tax on lotteries for Australians.  Certain games are still
<BR>
exempt from the withholding tax for the Canadians, according to the
<BR>
info at this URL: blackjack, baccarat, craps, roulette and big-6
<BR>
wheel.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Even with these numbers though, it might be a decent deal, however,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buying every possible number combination ranges from 7 million up to 70
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; million dollars in ticket buys. The state typically keeps half to two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thirds of the total amount even before the jackpot is made, and then you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also have subsidiary prizes. 
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>If there's no winner, the states pour some of the money back into the
<BR>
lotteries, building up the jackpot.  This leads to positive
<BR>
E.V. lotteries.  The consortium watched for those, and monitored the
<BR>
number of tix sold.
<BR>
