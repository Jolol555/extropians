<EM>&gt; &gt; No matter how maliciously we choose to wield our growing power over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nature, we can never begin to approach in capriciousness and sheer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mind-boggling indifference the actions displayed by nature herself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I like to think of nature as doing all it can to eventually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eliminate death, become compassionate to every living being..., given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what it has to work with.  Like a proud parent, I think of it has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being happy that it has finally successfully created beings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligent and powerful enough to start making a difference in all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is such an important point! We are nature. We are as much a part of the
<BR>
universe as anything else is. The processes of selection that gave us form
<BR>
also gave us the ability to change the world around us, even violating those
<BR>
existing processes of (biological) selection which produced us. That we
<BR>
affect the universe has no moral implication, except where it impacts other
<BR>
beings.
<BR>
<P>Ethics, and morality, can only exist in an environment of beings. We have
<BR>
duties to behave ethically to each other, to less intelligent species, to
<BR>
intelligences we create, and to ETs if they are out there. There is no
<BR>
ethical duty between humanity and the universe. None. It is a mindless
<BR>
machine, ours to do with as we will. Before it does unto us.
