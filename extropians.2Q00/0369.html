<P>So what?  We're talking about novices here, remember?  The files that are
<BR>
actually redundant if you don't use IE only amount to a couple of MB, which
<BR>
is far to small to affect performance on any machine capable of running
<BR>
Windows 95 in the first place.  Neophytes don't care if there is an extra
<BR>
file on their hard drive somewhere - they just want the machine to work.
<BR>
<P>Besides, the initial point was that anyone who wants to can easily run
<BR>
whichever browser they prefer on Windows.  That's the only question there is
<BR>
any possible legal issue about - the rest of this is just typical griping
<BR>
about how you want a feature the vendor didn't give you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you paid some place claiming to provide world peace, an investment
</EM><BR>
stake, or
<BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever, then you would expect the ability to do with it as you please
</EM><BR>
after it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is in your possession, or in the case of world peace, to get some world
</EM><BR>
peace.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; So, I am aware that the license agreement is not agreed to by the general
</EM><BR>
user
<BR>
<EM>&gt; because by the time they purchase the PC it is already installed, so that
</EM><BR>
they
<BR>
<EM>&gt; are receiving on their PC software for which they have paid money and it
</EM><BR>
is then
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in their possession.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The point here is that Microsoft has received money for the privilege of
</EM><BR>
having
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the operating system installed already.
</EM><BR>
<P>First off, buying a copy of Windows (or any other commercial software) does
<BR>
NOT mean that you own the program.  All you have purchased is the right to
<BR>
use the software.  You don't have a god-given right to be able to do
<BR>
anything you please with it.
<BR>
<P>Second, Microsoft does not claim that Windows has every possible feature
<BR>
imaginable.  They advertise a finite list of particular features, which you
<BR>
have the option of buying if you consider them worthwhile.  If you don't
<BR>
think they offer the right features, you can buy a different OS.  If other
<BR>
people agree with you, eventually MS will either go out of business or
<BR>
deliver the features you want.
<BR>
<P>Third, if your objection is the fact that Windows comes pre-installed on
<BR>
your computer, then your complaint is properly with the hardware
<BR>
manufacturer. If they don't give you the option, buy from a different
<BR>
company (there are plenty of build-to-order outfits that will pre-install a
<BR>
different OS, or just give you a naked system). If you have trouble finding
<BR>
a vendor that will do this, perhaps you should consider the possibility that
<BR>
this is due to actual consumer preferences rather than some kind of sinister
<BR>
plot.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, in terms of cars, if I buy some automobile and want to replace parts
</EM><BR>
of the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; engine, this is possible, although I'm not an expert mechanic so would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempt that.  In the frame of reference of computers, though, say I want
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; chop out 95% of the network stack, everything except the driver code for
</EM><BR>
my
<BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware peripheral configuration, user interface libs and kernel32 and
</EM><BR>
msgsrv32
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and perhaps a very few other things, and those basic system processes
</EM><BR>
having
<BR>
<EM>&gt; been fine-tuned to eliminate bloat, then that is a good thing to want for
</EM><BR>
what I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have paid for it.  For the car I can get the specifications.
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I think it is not so difficult, not to say I think I could have it done in
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; week, to have a list of the dependencies of each software module and a
</EM><BR>
simple
<BR>
<EM>&gt; program to remove a bunch of them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your car is simple enough that a single human being could conceivably modify
<BR>
it to a significant degree.  Windows isn't.
<BR>
<P>I see this attitude a lot in Linux enthusiasts, and it always amuses me
<BR>
because it reveals a deep lack of appreciation for the scale of software we
<BR>
are talking about. The number of interactions between different software
<BR>
components increases exponentially as the size of a program increases. On a
<BR>
&lt;100 KLOC project the kind of modification you are talking about is
<BR>
feasible, because the system is simple enough that the effort required to
<BR>
verify all those different instalaltion options actually work is not
<BR>
unreasonably large.
<BR>
<P>On a &gt;1 MLOC system like Window this same approach is simply not feasible.
<BR>
The effort required to identify every dependency, create alternant operating
<BR>
modes for each possible set of installation options, and then test all of
<BR>
these different combinations, would be much larger than the effort required
<BR>
to write the OS in the first place.  In essence, you're complaining that MS
<BR>
didn't spend an extra billion dollars on a feature that 95% of their
<BR>
customers don't even want.
