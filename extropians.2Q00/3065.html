Quoting Hal:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is not an early or intermediate level of nanotech development.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It would be among the most sophisticated nanotech applications imaginable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; By the time such a global system could be designed, developed and put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; into play, gray goo could have wiped out the world ten times over.
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert B. replies:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree strongly with this as I've said in another post.  Our *current*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sensing technology is more than sufficient to detect very small hot spots.
</EM><BR>
<P>Keep in mind that the paragraph preceding my comment envisioned an active
<BR>
defense which regularly entered every eukaryotic cell on the planet and
<BR>
inspected it for goo.  That is what I was referring to as an advanced
<BR>
nanotech application.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (I'm sure Spike could comment here.)  If there is reason to suspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; covert activities, we could easily launch equivalents of the Space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Infrared Telescope and turn them around to study earth.  It goes without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saying that we are not even completely aware of the sophistication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of our existing detection capabilities.  Considering the rapid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; progress in photon detectors (i.e. astronomers couldn't buy for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any price a 3 million pixel CCD 10 years ago, and now we have them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in consumer devices), I have little doubt that our detection capabilities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be up to the task.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With sufficient monitoring capacity we would know the *day* anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; released badbots on the planet.
</EM><BR>
<P>With sufficient monitoring capacity, any information gathering is possible
<BR>
in principle.  So this last statement is too broad to be very useful.
<BR>
<P>But if we are talking about early or intermediate nanotech, and our
<BR>
monitoring is restricted to detecting temperature anomalies, I don't
<BR>
think this is effective against some of Robert Freitas' scenarios.
<BR>
<P>Assume that the goo seeds are spread widely before beginning their
<BR>
growth phase.  Robert F. suggests dispersal by airplane.  Perhaps it
<BR>
would work to spread rock-coated nanites in the form of dust released
<BR>
into the atmosphere from a few locations over a period of many months.
<BR>
We now have potentially billions or even trillions of nucleation sites.
<BR>
<P>Each of these begins to grow simultaneously, not caring about local
<BR>
thermal pollution, but limited by some constraining temperature, such
<BR>
as the boiling point of water.  (We cook our food before eating it;
<BR>
perhaps the goo will find it more tender that way as well.)
<BR>
<P>According to Robert F.'s figures, this will not cause a noticeable (4
<BR>
degree) global increase in temperatures until something like 0.0001%
<BR>
of total biomass has been converted.  Due to the wide dispersal,
<BR>
localized hot spots may not be detectable either.  At this point the
<BR>
global temperature will rapidly increase to 100 degrees C.  If I am
<BR>
reading Robert F.'s equations right, this requires only a six to seven
<BR>
doublings by the goo[*], a matter of minutes.
<BR>
<P>At this point the growth rate ramps down and the remaining conversion
<BR>
takes three weeks so we don't burn our food.  Of course by this time
<BR>
the temperature has killed all life anyway.
<BR>
<P>I don't see how particle beams and similar technologies can deal with
<BR>
an attack of this sort.  The goo sites are too numerous and widespread,
<BR>
and the time from thermal detection to total destruction of the biosphere
<BR>
is too short.
<BR>
<P>Hal
<BR>
<P>[*] Replication time of 100 seconds, T = 300 K, and dissipation of 100
<BR>
MJ/kg implies 5x10^10 kg of nanotech according to the paper.  This is
<BR>
5x10^18 J per 100 seconds or 5x10^16 W.  Solar power is 1.75x10^17 for
<BR>
a total power input of 2.25x10^17.  Power scales as the fourth power
<BR>
of temperature.  For T = 285 K, the &quot;four degree&quot; detection threshold,
<BR>
power would be (285/300)^4 less, or 0.80 * 2.25x10^17 = 1.8x10^17.
<BR>
Subtract 1.75x10^17 for solar to get the nanotech contribution of 5x10^15
<BR>
W, one tenth of the level needed for 300 degrees.  Similar calculations
<BR>
for 373 K, the boiling point of water, require total power (373/300)^4
<BR>
more, or 2.34 * 2.25x10^17 = 5.26x10^17.  Subtract the solar contribution
<BR>
to get 3.51x10^17 W for the nanotech.  This is 7 times the 300 K figure.
<BR>
Therefore the difference between the four degree increase tempearture
<BR>
of 285 K and the boiling point temperature of 373 is a total factor of
<BR>
about 70, or 6-7 doublings.
