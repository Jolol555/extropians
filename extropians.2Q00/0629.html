<EM>&gt;&gt; Set aside Joy's disappointingly juvenile views on political economy

(lifted

<EM>&gt;&gt; straight out of Dickinson) and his muddled thinking about how some

collective
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &quot;we&quot; chooses the shape of the world (ignoring Arrow's Theorem).
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert asked:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&quot;Arrow's Theorem&quot;?  Ref by any chance?
</EM><BR>
<P>The fuller title is &quot;Arrow's Impossiblity Theorem,&quot; named after its author, 
<BR>
Kenneth Arrow and proven in his book, Social Choice and Individual Values 
<BR>
(2nd ed., New Haven, CT: Yale Univ. Press, 1970).  You might think of the 
<BR>
theorem as a similar but more general version of Condorcet's famous voting 
<BR>
paradox:  Given individuals 1, 2, and 3 voting on outcomes A, B, and C and a 
<BR>
preference ranking as illustrated below, a majority vote cannot generate a 
<BR>
&quot;socially preferred&quot; outcome.
<BR>
<P>Ranking          1          2          3
<BR>
1st                 A          B          C
<BR>
2nd                 B          C          A
<BR>
3rd                 C          A          B
<BR>
<P>It's an intransitive ordering, natch.  Condorcet eliminated majority rule as 
<BR>
a possible definition of social welfare; Arrow eliminated practically 
<BR>
everything else.  He made a few plausible assumptions about the form of 
<BR>
social welfare functions and then proved that no possible means of moving 
<BR>
from individual to &quot;social preferences&quot; could satisfy all of the assumptions. 
<BR>
&nbsp;It would be going a bit overboard to claim that Arrow's Impossibility 
<BR>
Theorem proves that a social welfare function is *logically* impossible.  One 
<BR>
might assert, for instance, that &quot;The Revolutionary Vanguard alone knows the 
<BR>
social welfare function.&quot;  But Arrow did make it pretty hard for reasonable 
<BR>
folks to claim that they can generate group preferences out of individual 
<BR>
preferences.  Collectivists note: You cannot get there from here.
<BR>
<P>(&quot;Dickinson&quot; is no obscure lefty economist, by the way; I meant to say 
<BR>
&quot;Dickens.&quot;)
