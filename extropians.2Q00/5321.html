<P>
I wrote this two or three years ago, since the subject of Orion has come up
<BR>
again I thought I'd re-post it.
<BR>
==========================================================
<BR>
<P>I've been reading a little about an incredible idea taken very seriously in
<BR>
the late 50's and early 60's but today is almost completely forgotten, it was
<BR>
called Project Orion. The idea was to make a spaceship big enough for 150
<BR>
people and all the equipment they could ever want and blast it into space.
<BR>
They wanted to make it 135 feet in diameter and 160 feet high and they wanted
<BR>
most of that space to be usable by people not wasted on fuel. They figured
<BR>
weight would be no problem, if a crew member wanted to bring along his
<BR>
antique bowling ball collection and his own personal barber chair there would
<BR>
be no objection. The advocates of this approach were not interested in low
<BR>
earth orbit or even the moon, they were certain they could be on Mars by 1965
<BR>
and Saturn by 1970, the leader of the project was determined to visit Pluto.
<BR>
And they figured all this would cost less than 10% what the Apollo moon
<BR>
project did.
<BR>
<P>You might think that these people must have been a bunch of crackpots, but
<BR>
it's not so. Nobel Prize winners  Niels Bohr, Hans Bethe and Harold Urey were
<BR>
all enthusiastic advocates of the idea. Freeman Dyson thought the idea was so
<BR>
brilliant that he took a one year leave of absence from the prestigious
<BR>
Institute of Advanced Study so he could work full time on the project.
<BR>
<P>Yes, there is a catch, Project Orion needed nuclear energy, even worse it
<BR>
needed nuclear bombs. The Orion spacecraft would contain 2000 nuclear bombs,
<BR>
most in the 20 kiloton range, the size of the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki.
<BR>
A bomb in a tank of water would shoot out the back of the ship, when it was
<BR>
100 feet away it would explode, the water would hit a carefully designed
<BR>
75 ton pusher plate and accelerate the ship. Between the pusher plate and the
<BR>
ship were 50 foot long gas filled shock absorbers to even out the jerk. They
<BR>
wanted everything to be as cheap as possible, so they asked the Coca-Cola
<BR>
company for the blueprints of one of their vending machines, then they scaled
<BR>
it up a little and planed to use it as the mechanism to dispense the bombs.
<BR>
<P>The pusher plate was obviously the most important part of the design. If you
<BR>
explode a powerful bomb near a circular plate of constant thickness it will
<BR>
shatter because of the uneven stresses that build up, but it turns out that
<BR>
if you carefully taper the plate and make certain that the explosion is dead
<BR>
center, the plate will be extraordinary  resistant to damage. A layer on the
<BR>
plate will be vaporized by the heat but if some heavy protective oil is
<BR>
spayed on it before each use it would be good for 2000 blasts. This beast was
<BR>
tough, if it was properly oriented the Orion Spacecraft could survive a
<BR>
16 megaton H bomb blast from only two thousand feet away, a fact of more than
<BR>
passing interest to the military. Orion needed lots of radiation shielding to
<BR>
protect the crew, but weight was never an issue so this was no problem.
<BR>
<P>Wernher von Braun though all this was a dumb idea, then he saw a movie of the
<BR>
launch of a one meter working model of Orion that shot 6 carefully timed
<BR>
high explosives chemical bombs out the back of the model, it rose 300 feet
<BR>
into the air in stable controlled flight. Wernher von Braun became a vocal
<BR>
supporter of project Orion.
<BR>
<P>They planed to launch Orion from atop eight 250 towers in Jackass Flats
<BR>
Nevada. The first bomb would be tiny, just .1 kiloton (100 tons of TNT)
<BR>
exploded 100 feet below craft and 150 feet above the ground, then a new and
<BR>
slightly larger bomb would be spit out the back every second for 50 seconds,
<BR>
the last bomb would be the largest, 20 kilotons, and by then the craft would
<BR>
be out of the atmosphere, the total yield of the 50 bombs would be 200
<BR>
kilotons. The launch would have been a spectacular sight, it'd make the Space
<BR>
Shuttle look like a bottle rocket.
<BR>
<P>Project Orion was lead by Ted Taylor, a mediocre physicist but a good
<BR>
inventor. Taylor had one unique talent, he has been called by some the best
<BR>
nuclear weapon engineer on planet Earth and the Leonardo da Vinci of nuclear
<BR>
bomb design. Taylor is the man who figured out how a two foot long 200 pound
<BR>
bomb could be made as powerful as the 12 foot long 10 ton World War 2
<BR>
Nagasaki bomb. The reason the Orion  spaceship was so much bigger and faster
<BR>
than anything we have today is that pound for pound such bombs have about a
<BR>
million times as much energy as any chemical rocket fuel.
<BR>
<P>Orion wasn't the only thing Taylor was interested in, he found a way to make
<BR>
new type of nuclear bomb, one that would produce a highly directional blast.
<BR>
He designed a little one kiloton bomb that could blast a 1000 foot tunnel
<BR>
straight through solid rock, he wanted to build a cheap tunnel between
<BR>
New York and San Francisco and have a supersonic subway 3000 miles long.
<BR>
<P>Considering the big controversy we had last year when a deep space probe was
<BR>
launched with just a few pounds of non weapon grade Plutonium on it to power
<BR>
the electronics it may seem incredible and irresponsible that anyone would
<BR>
even consider something as environmentally unfriendly as Orion, but we live
<BR>
in a very different world. At the time Orion was under serious study the USA
<BR>
was blowing up one megaton bombs deep under the sea and 300 miles in space
<BR>
and the USSR was blowing up 57 megaton bombs in the atmosphere, Orion seemed
<BR>
and indeed was pretty benign compared to that.
<BR>
<P>It all came to nothing of course, in 1963 the test ban treaty was signed
<BR>
stopping all nuclear explosions in space or the atmosphere making Orion
<BR>
illegal. The project died, but to this day most say it would have worked
<BR>
technologically if not politically.
<BR>
<P>Idea for a science fiction novel: A huge nickel iron asteroid is heading for
<BR>
Earth, it would take a 200,000 megaton bomb to divert it but no existing
<BR>
rocket is nearly powerful enough to deliver such a huge payload to the
<BR>
asteroid. The Earth seems doomed, then our hero remembers Project Orion.
<BR>
