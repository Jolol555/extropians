<EM>&gt; 	&quot;We suggest that an altered expression of genes involved in cell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; division occurs with age. These changes result in increased rates of somatic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mutation, leading to numerical and structural chromosome aberrations and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mutations that manifest themselves as an aging phenotype. [snip]
</EM><BR>
<P>In reading this I was struck by the degree to which they had gathered
<BR>
together a laundry list of aging phenomena and attributed them to
<BR>
mitotic disregulation.  [Perhaps my bogosity filter running a bit
<BR>
high...]  But it is worth asking why they are quoting presenilin
<BR>
and Alzheimer's when neurons in the brain *don't (usually) divide.
<BR>
This is the same (possible) mistake that Fossil makes in his book
<BR>
when he tries to attribute everything to telomere loss.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Next step: explaining WHY they change.  Comments?
</EM><BR>
<P>Mitotic Misregulation can easily be attributed to &quot;dysdifferentiation&quot;
<BR>
(an old theory by R. Cutler), that has as an underlying cause DNA
<BR>
damage.  I said 8 or more years ago in the sci.life-extension
<BR>
discussions that a major underlying factor in aging is the accumulation
<BR>
of DNA damage.  If you randomly change the code of the program sooner
<BR>
or later the program isn't going to work correctly.  This is going
<BR>
to apply to different degrees to dividing and non-dividing cells
<BR>
because of the different rates of repair that you get when you have
<BR>
to copy DNA.  It fits nicely with the Werner's Syndrome situation where
<BR>
a (presumed?) deficiency in DNA repair results in accelerated aging.
<BR>
<P>This means that effective solutions are going to require (a) replacing
<BR>
&quot;collectives&quot; of DNA (using whole organs with new DNA); (b) secondary
<BR>
&quot;nuclei&quot; [from biobots] that add &quot;patches&quot; to the genome as interim
<BR>
solutions, and finally (c) nuclear abortion and replacement with a new
<BR>
genome (done in vivo using nanobots).  Stem cell &quot;recharging&quot; (neuronal,
<BR>
immune system, etc.) would seem to offer potential benefits.
