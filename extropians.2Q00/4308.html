<BR>
<P>Your observations about Rand's emotional attachments to ideas and
<BR>
her personal strategies for accepting or refuting opposing
<BR>
viewpoints was really interesting to me. I found your analogy
<BR>
for describing responses as a squeal of feedback loops appealing.
<BR>
It is quite similar to something that I've been observing for the
<BR>
last 5-10 years in social interactions and their analogs in the physical
<BR>
world and their analogies in various human endevours.
<BR>
<P>I'll quote you again, so that the people here remember what you
<BR>
said.
<BR>
<P><EM>	&gt;As I have noted elsewhere in this discussion group, one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;the techniques for improving signal to noise ratio is
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;regenerative feedback. Regenerative feedback, however,
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;always introduces distortion, generally in the form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;maintaining wave forms past their original decay period.
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;When you turn up the regeneration too much, the feedback
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;completely overcomes the input signal and becomes a
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;self-sustaining feedback loop - the unmistakeable feedback
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;squeal.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...]
<BR>
<EM>	&gt;The feedback squeal, however, represents the parts of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;receiving system that you try to keep invisable.  It no
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;longer has anything to do with the triggering signal - just
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;the harmonics of the receiver.  To avoid this, you try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;detune the receiver, or introduce - in modern high-end P.A.
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;systems - smart detection and auto-dampening of such
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;feedback.  This corresponds in one sense, roughly, to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;Zen concept of the empty vessel for enlightenment - -
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;combined, let's say, with systematic mental tricks for
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;self-criticism.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[...]
<BR>
<EM>	&gt;I.e., you try to disengage your emotional attachment to
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;ideas. Any emotional attachment to an idea is a block to
</EM><BR>
<EM>	&gt;truth anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>It seems to me that if Rand simply stopped and took a deep breath
<BR>
when faced with something contradictory to her worldview, then she
<BR>
might not have polarized the people around her so much. It's a
<BR>
strategy that is useful in many daily living contexts.
<BR>
<P>I would like expand, or take your feedback idea a step further, and
<BR>
illustrate how one can use a feedback &quot;delay&quot; in our personal and
<BR>
social interactions. So then, allow me to start with &quot;The Physics of
<BR>
Traffic Flows&quot;.
<BR>
<P>A traffic flow is a classic stimulus-response problem, where the
<BR>
stimulus is oscillatory in nature, and if the total time lag is too
<BR>
large before a response or if the response is too strong, then
<BR>
instabilities result. The three time lags that contribute to the
<BR>
instabilities are:
<BR>
<P>1) perception time to recognize the nature of stimulus
<BR>
2) decision time required to choose response
<BR>
3) execution time for response.
<BR>
<P>One of my old professors, Dr. Montroll, at UC Irvine 18 years ago,
<BR>
modelled the traffic flow problem, deriving stability criteria for
<BR>
this system and he found that small low frequency disturbances cause
<BR>
the line of traffic to act as an amplifier. So if the time lag
<BR>
between an input fluctuation and a response is long, and the
<BR>
response is very strong, then one may be responding too strongly to
<BR>
a situation that has passed. The response might then be in phase
<BR>
with the fluctuation, further deteriorating the control.
<BR>
<P>The best way to stabilize this flow problem is to make *small*
<BR>
responses to small fluctuations soon after they occur. He said that
<BR>
it is good policy for the stabilization of social, economic, and
<BR>
political interactions as well as those common to traffic flows.
<BR>
<P>So then, one Rule-of-thumb in responding to any stimulus that one
<BR>
does not want to become unstable is: the longer one waits in
<BR>
response to a stimulus, the strength of that response should be
<BR>
exponentially less with respect to that time.
<BR>
<P>I prefer to take this even one step further, and instead of a
<BR>
_small reponse_, just take a _deep breath_.
<BR>
<P>I call this: &quot;The Pause that Refreshes&quot;, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Space Between the Thoughts&quot;
<BR>
<P>The times that I have had &quot;ballistic&quot; reactions to something usually
<BR>
meant that I had experienced a major conflict between my heart and
<BR>
my mind, or else something in my body chemistry was out of whack,
<BR>
and so a &quot;ballistic&quot; reaction to someone or something is a major
<BR>
wake-up call for me to go away and take care of that psychological
<BR>
or physical conflict inside of myself.
<BR>
<P>In the book: _First Things First_ by Stephen Covey, Covey devoted a
<BR>
chapter (9) to the &quot;Pause&quot;. He says that the quality of life depends
<BR>
on what happens in the space between stimulus and response. It's a
<BR>
moment of choice that is a moment of truth. A testing point of our
<BR>
character and competence. In this moment, some of the factors that
<BR>
are acting on us (often unconsciously):
<BR>
<P>- urgency
<BR>
- the social mirror
<BR>
- our own expectations
<BR>
- the expectations of others
<BR>
- our deep values
<BR>
- our operational values
<BR>
- our scripting
<BR>
- our self-awareness
<BR>
- our conscience
<BR>
- our fundamental needs
<BR>
- our wants
<BR>
<P>In our responses, we are responsible for our decisions. It's a
<BR>
precious moment- even those smallest pauses in response to a
<BR>
stimulus. Over time, those small conscious choices build to create
<BR>
an integrated life, where we recognize ourselves as a force of
<BR>
nature, rejoicing in life for its own sake, following our own hearts
<BR>
and minds on a particular path.
<BR>
<P>At the same time that I was reading Covey's book a few years ago, I
<BR>
was noticing that the &quot;Pause&quot; appeared in a number of other
<BR>
contexts, which I thought was really cool.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;Pause&quot; definitely appears in Beethoven's work.
<BR>
<P>Beethoven was a composer that I have a huge amount of respect for,
<BR>
and I consider him to be one of my heroes. When he was about 30, he
<BR>
started going deaf, and the style of his music suddenly changed.
<BR>
Each piece of music he wrote, he thought might be his last. As his
<BR>
ears closed to the sounds of the outer world, they opened up to the
<BR>
sounds of his inner world. By the time that he was 50, his deafness
<BR>
was total.
<BR>
<P>Beethoven is a master is his use of silence. Here, I'd like to use
<BR>
Yehudi Menuhin's words in describing Beethoven's pauses:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;His pauses are among the most pregnant voids in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universe; like the emptiness of space, they are filled with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the power of magnetic tensions, set up in like manner by the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mass of each heavenly body. Those pauses are essential to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the music. When we experience them we find the pulse is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never absent, and the way the music then continues is quite
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wonderful. If the following phrase comes in a trifle too
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soon or too late, the magical effect is lost, for the length
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of silence is predetermines and fateful.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The &quot;Pause&quot; definitely appears in meditation. When we meditate there
<BR>
is a meaningless flow of thoughts that pass through the mind, and
<BR>
one tries not to become involved. A thought that is ignored soon
<BR>
goes away, and then in the space between thoughts is a glimpse of
<BR>
clarity, reality. In between the train of ideas that flows thorough
<BR>
the mind are small gaps between, utterly devoid of form or content.
<BR>
These calm spaces are the &quot;pauses that refresh&quot;, providing a peace
<BR>
and energy, not anxious, not pushing us in any direction. The space
<BR>
presents us with an opportunity to break free from negative thought
<BR>
patterns and habitual behaviors. It is an intermediate state filled
<BR>
with freedom.
<BR>
<P>These are some of my thoughts about &quot;spaces&quot; and &quot;pauses&quot;. I'm sure
<BR>
you folks can find more contexts and examples.
<BR>
<P>By the way, the phrase &quot;The Pause that Refreshes&quot; came to me from
<BR>
somewhere, but I don't remember from where. I think that it was a
<BR>
catch phrase from a TV soft drink ad, but I honestly don't remember
<BR>
which soft drink. I've not had a TV for about 4 years, so it's not a
<BR>
recent ad. Does anyone remember?
