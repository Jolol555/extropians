Just what on earth is there to love about _any_ country?
<BR>
Patriotism, IMO, is a very anti-extropian sentiment. For the proof of
<BR>
the pudding, just go read any history of the first world war (one that
<BR>
doesn't focus on the trivial US involvement in that struggle, but goes
<BR>
into the broad picture).
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I admit that nations sometimes with bad/greedy/mistrustful leadership do 
<BR>
exploit their own people and the other nations around them.  But this shows 
<BR>
the truth of the old saying &quot;a nation gets the government it deserves.&quot;  And 
<BR>
this applies whether you are talking about the people of the U.S., Iraq or 
<BR>
England.
<BR>
<P>I am proud to be a citizen of the United States of America.  I realize my 
<BR>
nation has many blemishes on its record and many things still need to be 
<BR>
corrected.
<BR>
<P>Still, I am proud of what the founding fathers did in giving us such a 
<BR>
brilliant foundation to build on.  And I am proud of the great progress 
<BR>
which has been made in terms of civil rights, technological development, 
<BR>
military power (sometimes very rightly used such as in WWII) and the way we 
<BR>
have built a strong and relatively efficient commercial sector.
<BR>
<P>I am aware of the history of WWI and how the 'great powers' practically 
<BR>
sacrificed a generation of young men by marching them into killing zones of 
<BR>
artillery and machine gun fire.  This war was so horrific that it even 
<BR>
affected a young Adolf Hitler to the point where despite becoming a moral 
<BR>
monster later on, he avoided the use of chemical weapons because he had seen 
<BR>
them used firsthand.
<BR>
<P>I think a rational patriotism is not anti-extropian.  Any thoughts on this, 
<BR>
gentleman and ladies?  Nations, at least at the present time, are an 
<BR>
overarching organizational structure for humanity.  It is what we have to 
<BR>
work with, and so we should each do our best to work within it, to make 
<BR>
positive changes.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps in time, technological advances in such areas as nanotech, AI and 
<BR>
longevity will produce a population that will want and get a much more 
<BR>
'libertarian' approach to governments and nations.  We may in time, even see 
<BR>
very radical approaches to this and the disbanding of some nations as we 
<BR>
know of them now.
<BR>
<P>Charlie, you spoke of war.  WWI might be looked at as a 'civil war' within 
<BR>
the European world.  As some citizens (especially in third world nations) 
<BR>
begin to gain power through the coming technologies, they may have a fervent 
<BR>
desire to break away from corrupt, murderous and power-hungry governments.  
<BR>
We may see some very vicious civil wars and insurgencies as people rise up 
<BR>
to get away from or overthrow oppressive governments, in the desire to 
<BR>
replace them with something very different.
<BR>
<P>I fervently hope that in the first world and especially in the United 
<BR>
States, that dialogue and change can be done in productive and peaceful 
<BR>
ways.  Rather then an elimination of the U.S. government, I see changes that 
<BR>
would simply reduce its size and influence, while handing over much more 
<BR>
power to the people.
<BR>
<P>Of course, for those who feel this is far too compromising, there will in 
<BR>
the future the option to go to the oceans or also outer space to found the 
<BR>
type of communities that radical libertarians and extropians dream of.  I 
<BR>
wish you all luck and in time may join you, but for now please understand if 
<BR>
I feel pride and a touch of emotion when I see the American flag waving in 
<BR>
the wind.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
