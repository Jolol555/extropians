<EM>&gt;Subject: Recreating people [was: renaissance people]
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I had discussed the problem of whether it will be feasible to know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the difference between A(recreated)-humans vs. and the decorporealized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;originals.
</EM><BR>
<P>The actual context was:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;And of course even with &quot;live&quot; humans, instantiations are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;subject to a wide range of variation (so much so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people often find themselves asking whether or not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person is not someone completely different), so it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be difficult to know whether the A-Sasha *is* Sasha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But from a metaphysical standpoint, does that really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matter if A-Sasha, derived from Bio-Sasha, responds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in substantially similar ways?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Melzack's Neuromatrix theory of self seems to adequately explain this
</EM><BR>
point.
<BR>
<P>The particular point that I think Melzack deals with well (also see his
<BR>
Gateway theory of pain ... ) is his notion of a neuro-signature:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Ronald Melzack introduced concerning phantom pain. His theory involves the
<BR>
integration of three separate pathways in the brain with a concept called
<BR>
the neurosignature. Melzack proposes that a large number of interconnected
<BR>
neurons, a neuromatirx, exists in every person. That neuromatrix analyses
<BR>
the sensory information and gives perception of sensation. The
<BR>
neurosignature comes into play at this point. It tells the brain that the
<BR>
perceptions of sensation are from the &quot;self.&quot; The neurosignature tells the
<BR>
brain that your arm is YOUR arm, not someone else's. (Melzack,1992, 1990)
<BR>
The parietal lobe is heavily involved in the neurosignature.(Saks 1990)
<BR>
<P>Patients with lesions in the parietal lobe have been known to throw their
<BR>
own leg out of bed in the middle of the night because it felt like someone
<BR>
else's leg!
<BR>
<P>Melzack presents a very good metaphor for understanding the neurosignature.
<BR>
He relates it to an piece of classical music with the neurosignature being
<BR>
the theme of the piece, that constant thing which defines the piece. The
<BR>
sensory inputs and outputs are the other instruments. The instruments change
<BR>
key, tempo and sometimes even rhythm, but there is always that theme giving
<BR>
the piece is personality.&quot;
<BR>
_______________________________________________
<BR>
<P>If you are worried about the wider Metamorphosis problem (Kafka's man
<BR>
changed into a beetle) then we are dealing with metaphysical problems that
<BR>
might be wider in scope than Melzack's Neuromatrix. As I have probably said
<BR>
here before, these type of philosophical problems are resolved by Median
<BR>
Vision Theory www.multi.co.uk/primal.htm
