<EM>&gt; Observation in person is one thing, automated pattern recognition by a

<EM>&gt; entirely. Unless they man every camera with a human being, this is in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact unconstitutional, because it violates your right to confront your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accuser. You can't confront a computer, it is not a person.

and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Any means of gathering evidence not under immediate human supervision

<EM>&gt; time stamped it is.

<P>Sorry, Mike, but I think you're really reaching here. By that logic nothing
<BR>
done on the Internet could ever qualify as a crime, unless someone manages
<BR>
to literally look over your shoulder while you do it. With immersive VR and
<BR>
personal software agents on the horizon, and most of the financial world
<BR>
becoming increasingly automated, the idea that only direct observations by
<BR>
human beings can be used as evidence is completely impractical. There are
<BR>
just too many ways to commit theft, fraud and vandalism in ways that are
<BR>
physically impossible to observe in that fashion.
<BR>
<P>The obvious solution, which has already been adopted by the courts, is to
<BR>
allow evidence from log files, recording devices and forensic tests while
<BR>
keeping in mind that such evidence is not necessarily 100% reliable. In
<BR>
cases where a recording device is the only evidence there is a tendency to
<BR>
go overboard with reliability measures, requiring that manufacturers achieve
<BR>
incredibly high reliability levels before their evidence can be considered
<BR>
sufficient for a conviction. In cases where the recording device merely
<BR>
corroborates human testimony, such as convenience store video cameras, the
<BR>
standard of reliability is of course much lower. This all seems pretty
<BR>
reasonable to me.
<BR>
<P>As for the right to confront your accuser, well, we are just going to have
<BR>
to face up to the fact that it is now possible for a criminal to be caught
<BR>
red-handed by a completely automated system. This is going to become
<BR>
increasingly common whether the government puts up cameras or not - for
<BR>
example, if Amex's (existing) activity-checking AI spots you using a stolen
<BR>
credit card, you have the same problem.
<BR>
<P>IMO the logical application of our current principles would be to consider
<BR>
the organization that runs the surveillance device to be your accuser, and
<BR>
consider the presence of their chosen representative in the courtroom to be
<BR>
sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement.  I also think it is
<BR>
important that the defense be able to subpoena anyone who has anything to do
<BR>
with running the system, so that you can effectively raise issues regarding
<BR>
its reliability.
<BR>
<P>And, once again, that is pretty much how it works (at least in Texas).
