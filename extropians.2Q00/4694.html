From: &quot;John Calvin&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mercurial@disinfo.net?Subject=Re:%20Identity%20by%20smell%20(was%20Re:silly%20walks%20department)&In-Reply-To=&lt;00060806540300.00238@tachyon&gt;">mercurial@disinfo.net</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt; I do have a couple of friends that I am sure I could recognize by smell.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I can identify all of my female companions by smell; every girl smells
<BR>
slightly different.  It is like any other identity marker.  In fact, I
<BR>
think that most people could accurately identify individuals they are
<BR>
intimately familiar with using any one of their five senses.  I would
<BR>
expect that the same applies to males, but I've never been in a position
<BR>
to know :^)
<BR>
<P>However, going out on a limb, I've also noticed that ethnic groups as a
<BR>
whole have a characteristic smell that is not dependent on where they
<BR>
actually live.  In other words, a Japanese girl born and raised in New
<BR>
York will have a similar type of smell to one born and raised in Tokyo,
<BR>
but will smell distinctly different than, say, a girl of Mexican descent.
<BR>
<P>In other words, it has always seemed to me that genetically similar groups
<BR>
of people have a similar and characteristic smell, although each
<BR>
individual in that group will have their own unique version of it.  I
<BR>
wonder how much smell actually influences mate selection and
<BR>
supports similar types of subconscious communication.
