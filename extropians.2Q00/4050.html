<EM>&gt; &gt;What if they announced that if the state attempted to break them up, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they were sorry, but they couldn't then be bothered to fix the bug in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;OS that would destroy the data on every system using it in the near future?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the smartest and coolest thing would be if Bill Gates announced, one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; week before the presidential election, that unless the case against MS is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dropped withing 20 days, he would be selling - no, make that giving away (to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the flat earth society) - all his stocks in every company that he owns, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that microsoft would be disolving, that all microsoft buildings would be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; converted to storage bins, and that all cash assets he has, except for a few 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; million living expense, would be dumped into the ocean.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, that's 15th-century economic thinking.  Microsoft doesn't
<BR>
have &quot;hard&quot; assets like gold, land, or even semi-hard ones like cash.
<BR>
Almost all of their value, and far more than is represented by the stock
<BR>
owned by Bill, is shareholder trust that he won't do silly things like
<BR>
that, backed up by &quot;fiduciary responsibility&quot; laws and contracts that
<BR>
would bite him if he did.  The only real assets he might be capable of
<BR>
destroying are tapes full of source code and maybe customer lists, but
<BR>
even if he did all that, and sold his own shares and flew to Argentina,
<BR>
the executives and working folk of Microsoft, their business practices,
<BR>
their associations with other businesses, and every other value they have
<BR>
would still make the company a powerhouse.  Wyatt can light his refinery
<BR>
and walk away, but today's Wyatts can't.
