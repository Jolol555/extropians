Dear Extropes,
<BR>
<P>I wonder why folks (not only here) pay so much attention to defining
<BR>
and critiquing art?
<BR>
<P>My (admittedly uneducated-in-formal-art-matters) perspective about
<BR>
art is that:
<BR>
<P>* someone's art has value if they succeed in creating a concrete
<BR>
manifestation of something that &quot;moves&quot; them
<BR>
<P>* that person's art has an even higher value if that other person's
<BR>
art succeeds in moving _me_
<BR>
<P>I know that it's a perspective with fuzzy boundaries, with alot of
<BR>
room for discussion of how someone can create crappy art, and how
<BR>
that &quot;crappy&quot; art can move someone.
<BR>
<P>However,  someone's &quot;crappy&quot; art (which simply means that I don't like
<BR>
it) has an easy solution for me: I am free to walk away from it, or
<BR>
walk out of the theatre, or out of the concert hall, or turn off the
<BR>
TV, or put the book away, etc.
<BR>
<P>[I'm using &quot;art&quot; to connote the range of human expression such as
<BR>
painting, writing, music, dance, photography, film, etc.]
<BR>
<P>The subject of this thread says it all (in my view). Art simply
<BR>
_is_. It's that means of expression that takes me out of my head,
<BR>
where I usually spend many hours of every day, and it puts me in my
<BR>
body in the present. It's a way that I can let my child-self loose
<BR>
and let my imagination run away with itself and be myself. And art
<BR>
is a very important and necessary balancing force to my life. So
<BR>
then, &quot;Art is.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Until I become more skilled at certain aspects of my &quot;arts&quot;, I
<BR>
refrain from analyzing in a rational way, arts by others, and
<BR>
instead I pay attention to that art's effect on my senses.
<BR>
(Actually, I don't think I would enjoy analyzing art anyway).
<BR>

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;IMHO Vangough couldn't paint for toffee, his pictures belong in  a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;school corridor somewhere with a label saying &quot;1st year art class&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Van Gogh's skill level doesn't bother me at all. His paintings
<BR>
certainly do have a child-like aspect to them... and well, I'm a
<BR>
child ! I like that aspect to his works.
<BR>
<P>Here's my story about Van Gogh.
<BR>
<P>One month ago for business and for holiday, I discovered that I was
<BR>
travelling through a region in France where Van Gogh spent the last
<BR>
year of his life.
<BR>
<P>Since I have admired, for a couple of decades, a painting of Van
<BR>
Gogh's called &quot;Starry Night&quot;, and this painting like no other
<BR>
captures the passionate essence of the astronomy profession (IMHO),
<BR>
I decided to learn more about the man (Van Gogh) who made that
<BR>
painting.
<BR>
<P>For 5 days, by coincidence and then on purpose, I followed some of
<BR>
Van Gogh's footsteps in Provence. I stood at the places where he
<BR>
stood when he painted many scenes.  I smelled the air, I saw the
<BR>
light and the colors, I felt the Sun's warmth, I heard the sounds,
<BR>
and I believe that I understood some of his motivations to paint his
<BR>
pictures in the way that he did.
<BR>
<P>The Sun kisses the land in a really sweet way. The limestone rock on
<BR>
the local Alpilles mountains is so white that it blinds your eyes.
<BR>
The blue sky is _really blue_, and the white swirley clouds contrast
<BR>
sharply against the sky. The olive trees are wonderfully crooked,
<BR>
giving  an appearance of ancient sages that observe everything and
<BR>
saying nothing. The fragrance of lilacs permeated everything. The
<BR>
greens and lavenders and oranges and reds of the  herbs and wild flowers
<BR>
are chaotic and wild and alive. And the overall golden veil of yellow
<BR>
on the landscape would make you feel warm, even if it was freezing
<BR>
cold outside.
<BR>
<P>Probably if I was a &quot;first year art student&quot; and someone put a
<BR>
paintbrush in my hand, I would paint the scenes that Van Gogh saw,
<BR>
in a way that he did. But he would still paint better paintings because
<BR>
his wild mind was a lot more wild than mine!
<BR>
<P>I am very glad that Van Gogh managed to capture on canvas what I
<BR>
experienced when I was there.
