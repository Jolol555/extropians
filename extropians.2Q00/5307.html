<EM>&gt; &gt; The U.S. has had more than one civil war, but most people only remember

<EM>&gt; &gt; they could go critical given the right conditions, IMO.

<EM>&gt; Has not the interstate highway gone a long way in erasing regional

<EM>&gt; issues, by mixing people from all over?  The faceless shell stations

<EM>&gt; and minimarts at every freeway exit all look alike and are manned

<P><P>The problems aren't always inter-regional.  Not to re-hash my favorite
<BR>
example, but northern Nevada gets along very well with other people; it is
<BR>
the Federal government towards which they a severe and deep-seated hatred.
<BR>
Unfortunately, the Feds often taken on the appearance of another regional
<BR>
culture, in this case, New England (literally -- many of the agents there
<BR>
are from New Jersey and similar and have nothing in common with the
<BR>
locals).  So to that extent, it kind of looks like a regional/cultural
<BR>
issue.
<BR>
<P>Not to get off on a rant, but the Federal govt engages in some really
<BR>
despicable behavior in northern Nevada.  The current game has been to
<BR>
revoke all leases (federal leases being required to make a living up
<BR>
there), and then only reinstate them if you &quot;inform&quot; against your
<BR>
neighbors.  Its kind of like the DMV only granting you a drivers license
<BR>
if you turn in your friends for speeding first.  It is a lot more complex
<BR>
than it sounds as well, since living up there pretty much requires that
<BR>
you violate regulations somewhere, even if what you are doing makes
<BR>
perfect sense in that locale.  For example, many of the roads in northern
<BR>
Nevada, including most of the ones everyone uses are illegal in their
<BR>
existence and are illegally maintained and repaired (the fines are very
<BR>
expensive, starting in the five to six figure range).  There are towns to
<BR>
which the only access is via &quot;illegal&quot; roads.  For obvious reasons, this
<BR>
is usually overlooked by the Feds.  However, if you have a disagreement
<BR>
with them, they will suddenly charge you with dozens of regulatory
<BR>
violations -- unless, of course, you turn in a few of your neighbors for
<BR>
similar violations.  It is no wonder that people up there view the federal
<BR>
government as a sick and vile entity when you consider what their
<BR>
experience has been.  People up there are continually bullied,
<BR>
threatened, harrassed, and generally have a very unpleasant impression
<BR>
that the government has become a police state where its agents exercise
<BR>
their authority in arbitrary and capricious manners.  Average people up
<BR>
there discuss things that haven't been talked about by the citizens of
<BR>
this country in a long time.
