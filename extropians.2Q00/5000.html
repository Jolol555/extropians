<BR>
humor and maybe some underlying values, but many of my values have changed, 
<BR>
that would connect me to my former self, regardless of which one is smarter.  
<BR>
Each transition of character is as vital to the whole as the result of each 
<BR>
pivot point. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Natasha, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is entirely correct.  I look into the mirror each day and repeat the 
<BR>
old German saying, &quot;So soon old, so late smart.&quot;  Yet that does not change 
<BR>
that I would find the motives I had as a younger man occasionally beyond my 
<BR>
present understanding.
