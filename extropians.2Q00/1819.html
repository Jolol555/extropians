<EM>&gt; Microsoft's practices have sought to establish and maintain a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the operating system field. They have then used the leverage this has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given them to establish strongholds in other areas. In all of these,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they have ignored standards compliance, acted uncompetetively to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point of illegality and in general been directly in the way of free and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open control of technological development - something I know people on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this list support.
</EM><BR>
<P>So we're back to this, are we?
<BR>
<P>The laws Microsoft is accused of breaking are so vague as to be
<BR>
meaningless - there is literally no possible course of conduct a business
<BR>
could adopt that could not be construed as a violation. The only thing that
<BR>
distinguishes Microsoft from detractors like Sun is that MS has been better
<BR>
at competing in the free market.
<BR>
<P>Microsoft competes vigorously in the market, using every tool available to
<BR>
it. That is exactly what companies are supposed to do, and I applaud them
<BR>
for it. I don't care how much damage they've done to their competitors,
<BR>
because damaging competitors is what a company is supposed to do. The
<BR>
purpose of a market is to benefit customers, after all.
<BR>
<P>Any attempt to replace this vigorous competition with some kind of managed
<BR>
&quot;fair&quot; competition will simply hobble the operation of the market and create
<BR>
excuses for further government meddling. History shows that government is
<BR>
not fit to judge what products consumers what, how much they should cost,
<BR>
how they should be bundled, or what technologies should be used to build
<BR>
them. Leaving these decisions up to the market may not always produce
<BR>
perfect results, but it does give us steady improvement over time.
<BR>
Government intervention, OTOH, simply replaces voluntary choices with a
<BR>
political process that inevitably leads to inefficiency, low quality,
<BR>
stifled innovation and lack of choice for consumers.
