<EM>&gt; &gt; Mike, you can't imagine how wildly weird this sort of

<EM>&gt; &gt; society must have become to permit a rational man like

<EM>&gt; &gt; yourself to regard such fears as natural and attitudes

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's amazing; such views are very common in the US.  Is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it the basic notion that someone might try to defend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; himself that seems wildly weird?  Or is it specific to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use of guns?
</EM><BR>
<P>Here in the UK, we have *very* restrictive gun laws so I'll
<BR>
try to shed some light on the different perspectives between
<BR>
here and the US.  Firstly, Hal, I think Damien was referring
<BR>
to notion that someone would *need* to defend themselves.
<BR>
This highlights the difference in perspectives:  Most of the
<BR>
Americans on this list are Libertarians; they look at the
<BR>
gun &quot;problem&quot; in terms of an individuals need to protect him
<BR>
or herself from intruders.  The common perspective in the UK
<BR>
is to look at the effect of guns on society as a whole,
<BR>
without regard to the individual.  The point here is, that
<BR>
while the average Briton or, it would seem, Australian
<BR>
thinks, &quot;there are only x number of violent crimes a year&quot;
<BR>
an American (or Libertarian, at least) would think, &quot;there's
<BR>
an x chance of a violent crime happening to me&quot;.  Clearly
<BR>
the latter view leads to the adoption of a pro-gun attitude
<BR>
whereas with the former view this isn't as obvious a choice.
<BR>
<P>RE: Smart Guns
<BR>
<P>The value of these devices can again be considered from a
<BR>
social point-of-view (i.e. how many people are killed by
<BR>
guns accidentally or by having their guns used against them
<BR>
vs. the number of extra deaths likely to result from the
<BR>
type of scenarios Michael Lorrey has mentioned) or an
<BR>
individualist point-of-view (i.e. will this prohibit me from
<BR>
adequately protecting myself?).  I'm not sure of my own
<BR>
opinions on this matter (if I had my way, I'd let the market
<BR>
decide, but that's another discussion entirely).
