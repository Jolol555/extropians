</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have just read David Pearce's web site--quickly, I must confess, without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;taking the time to ponder the contents of each paragraph.  All sorts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possibiilities and questions ran through my mind as I was reading, and I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very sorry I don't have someone around to talk to about it.  I could've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;talked to my cousin Lizzie, but unfortunately she's dead.
</EM><BR>
<P>What's the site you're referring to please?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;She was taking Prozac for a while and described the vividness of colors,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;escpecially purple, when she was on the drug. Comparing descriptions, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decided that my ordinary view of the world was like her view on Prozac.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tried taking some to see what it would be like, and I didn't notice any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;difference in colors.  I DID notice a startling feeling of goodwill towards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;strangers I encountered, such as people standing in check-out lines at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stores.  I found myself striking up conversations with them and they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sharing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the secrets of their lives with me.  I'd never before found ordinary people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so fascinating.  I only used the Prozac for a couple of weeks, because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was having some bad side effects.
</EM><BR>
<P>I tried Prozac as well, and it made me tremendously depressed.  I have read 
<BR>
that this experience is common, especialy with initial use.  Prozac 
<BR>
supposedly blocks re-uptake of Seratonin.  An apparently much more powerful 
<BR>
and direct alternative, based on the recent Time Magazine coverage, is 
<BR>
extasy, which I haven't tried yet, but now I'm tempted.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Something I've been wondering about lately is this:  what is it that makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me and certain of my relatives different from most people?  My daughter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;brought up this question when Lizzie's son came to visit for a day.  She
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;commented that it was great to see him, because it's rare to meet people 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are REALLY FUN to be with, as he is.  The quality I'm talking about has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do with sensing the unexpected in the ordinary--for example, looking at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clouds and seeing hundreds of different shade of white and at the same time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hearing (in one's mind) all these shades of white translated into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corresponding frequencies of sound; or listening to the rumbling of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;machine and suddenly hearing intensely beautiful music in the combination 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sounds and seeing (in the mind) the sounds translated into something like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;graphs of mathematical functions, weaving in and out of each other.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Walking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;down a city street, pausing to look into partly veiled windows and under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stones and into alleys can be among the most exciting of experiences.  Most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the time I prefer to walk alone, but when I can be with a person who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shares this way of seeing, the experience is all the richer for sharing it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now you're asking some interesting questions.  In fact, about a year ago it 
<BR>
hit the major news sources that researchers had identified a gene complex 
<BR>
that specifically caused the &quot;addictive personality.&quot;  People with this gene 
<BR>
did not enjoy sunsets or flocks of birds or moonlit nights - unless they 
<BR>
altered their brain chemistry via alcohol or coke or extasy or heroine, etc. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they became closer to what you and I consider normal.
<BR>
<P>The really surprising things, however, were (1) how many people had the 
<BR>
addictive/depressive gene and (2) the groupings of percentages.
<BR>
<P>The native Americans tested had the highest percentage with the gene, at 
<BR>
about 85% of the population, which corresponds precisely to the common 
<BR>
experience of problems of alcoholism and other drugs in that population.  
<BR>
Asians also had a very high percentage with the gene.  American blacks had - 
<BR>
as best I recall - about 60% with the gene.  The lowest percentage - at 
<BR>
about 30%, I think - were people from Northern Europe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The &quot;bipolar&quot; people I've known sometimes seem to see this way when they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in their manic phases.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Some people have actually accused me of being bipolar because I can get so 
<BR>
into things in a way that they obviously cannot.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I've always thought of this way of seeing as being &quot;childlike,&quot; because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;young children often seem to understand it better than older people. So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maybe the explanation for it is that some people retain certain childlike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aspects of the nervous system into old age. I'm pretty sure my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;great-grandmother was like this, although she died when I was pretty young,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so I can't know for sure. I'm 50 years old, but I generally feel as though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm in the company of my elders when I'm with people in their 20's and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;30's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'd like to know more about this, just out of self-curiosity.  Why am I the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way I am?  It's a pleasant way of being, except that I don't come across
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;many people to share it with.  Is there some practical use to be made of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or is it something to be enjoyed mostly in silence (I say in silence,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because people usually think I'm crazy if I speak of it.  Lizzie didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think I was crazy.  God, I miss her so much!). Maybe the Prozac made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ordinary people fascinating to me because it allowed me to better translate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my thoughts and theirs into a mutually understandable language.
</EM><BR>

The Time article on Extasy mentioned some studies indicating that long-term 
<BR>
brain damage might result from the drug.  However, those studies did not 
<BR>
rule out a host of possible intervening factors, unfortunately, and the 
<BR>
worst damage seemed to be a reduction in certain specific kinds of memory.  
<BR>
Since there are a whole lot of people who have used the drug hundreds of 
<BR>
times and are still functional, I suspect those studies, but I can't rule 
<BR>
the possibility out that there might be something there.
<BR>
<P>I really suggest you check out that article, as it might offer some 
<BR>
solutions or insights.
<BR>
<P>And, if you think it's worth the risk, you might suggest that those people 
<BR>
who you feel blocked from shareing your sense of life with try some extasy 
<BR>
with you, so that you can get through to them.  If it works, then you can 
<BR>
tell them - hey, I feel like this ALL THE TIME.
<BR>
<P>This was one of the most common uses for the drug, in fact.  Before it was 
<BR>
made illegal - which it is, quite seriously now of course, like almost 
<BR>
anything that makes you feel good (After all, consider that those jerks who 
<BR>
tend to end up in politics or religion are probably carrying double doses of 
<BR>
the addictive gene, and if they can't enjoy life, by GOD!, they'll make sure 
<BR>
no one else does either.) - psychotherapists were using it with couples to 
<BR>
bring them together and overcome blocks to intimacy.
