<EM>&gt; The other, and perhaps more valid argument is whether or not &quot;power by the

<EM>&gt; people&quot; is even worth pursuing.  The public has a reputation of being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blissfully uninformed, prefering realistic fiction to cold hard fact.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people in the traditional legislature are usually above-average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence, and have a basic understanding of the legal system.  While
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appointing a small amount of leaders may limit the truest form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; democracy, perhaps it is better than letting a large amount of uninformed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people make the crucial decisions of the country.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The above idea is truly just that: an idea.  Any comments or suggestions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are more than welcome.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I can think of one possible solution to mitigate the &quot;ignorant masses&quot;
<BR>
problem of a true electronic democracy:  give each person a finite number
<BR>
of votes.
<BR>
<P>The idea being that if you give a person a relatively small number of
<BR>
votes relative to the number of issues to vote on, they are far more likely
<BR>
to use that vote in determining the outcome of issues that they really care
<BR>
about (and presumably be better educated about).  I think part of the
<BR>
problem with a true democracy, electronic or otherwise, is that it
<BR>
requires too much time to become informed on all the issues.  The result
<BR>
is that voting often gets diluted by the uninformed, who vote along party
<BR>
lines or other arbitrary criteria as a default behavior.  I would think
<BR>
that a limited vote democracy would encourage voting on specific issues to
<BR>
only be done by people who actually have a vested interest.
<BR>
<P>Naturally, there are downsides.  The biggest one I can think of is a
<BR>
scenario where a minority gets defeated not because the majority of the
<BR>
public doesn't support them at large, but that the only people interested
<BR>
enough to use a vote against them are numerically larger.  However, I
<BR>
would expect that this could be effectively worked with by determining the
<BR>
number of votes issued as a function of total issues to vote on and coming
<BR>
up with a useable ratio.
<BR>
<P>Hell, I don't know.  This was the first thing that popped into my head.
