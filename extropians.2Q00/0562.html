<EM>&gt; The most important precondition that must apply before a market can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; function properly is that the market must be _fair_. That is, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary for competitors to abide by contracts, obey market regulations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which should admittedly be as minimal as possible), and compete on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the merits of their products.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, a free market requires that companies:
<BR>
<P>1) refrain from using physical force to coerce others
<BR>
2) abide by the terms of any contracts they voluntarily agree to
<BR>
3) refrain from committing fraud (in a narrow sense) in the course of
<BR>
business dealings
<BR>
<P>That's it. Nothing else.
<BR>
<P>Exactly what companies compete on is up to their customers. In some markets
<BR>
technical features may be the dominant consideration, but in others it may
<BR>
be price, simplicity, reliability, company reputation, service and support,
<BR>
or just about anything else imaginable. There is no place in a free market
<BR>
system for self-appointed 'experts' who debate what criteria they think
<BR>
consumers *ought* to use, and second-guess the decisions of the market by
<BR>
government fiat.
<BR>
<P>The idea that markets need to be 'fair' is simply another justification for
<BR>
endless socialistic intervention on the part of government.  Competition can
<BR>
never, ever be 'fair', because no two companies will ever have the same
<BR>
information, resources, technology base, corporate culture or market
<BR>
position. Competition is always a matter of disparate organizations
<BR>
approaching a market in different ways with varying degrees of competence.
<BR>
<P>Any attempt to change this inevitable fact of nature will run afoul of the
<BR>
same problems that turn government welfare programs into fiascos - in order
<BR>
to promote 'fairness' you have to punish those who are successful by
<BR>
confiscating their assets, which you then bestow on those who are less
<BR>
successful. You have to pass laws forbidding useful new innovations, in
<BR>
order to preserve laggard businesses who have trouble coping with them. In
<BR>
short, you must reduce the efficiency of the market by punishing productive
<BR>
behavior and rewarding unproductive behavior.
<BR>
<P>The best known way of running an economy is to establish a rule of law which
<BR>
constrains force and fraud and enforces contracts, and then do *nothing else
<BR>
whatsoever*. The resulting market will not always produce the best results
<BR>
imaginable, but it *will* always produce better results than any other
<BR>
system that has ever been tried.
