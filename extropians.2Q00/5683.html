</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quality of life like we do, then they should work to recreate our success 
</EM><BR>
where
<BR>
<EM>&gt; they are at. Part of that is re-engineering their society. Societies that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produce more people than can be sustained on their resources not only 
</EM><BR>
degrade
<BR>
<EM>&gt; their own quality of life, by exporting the results of their bad social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reproduction policies to our countries, they not only perpetuate a dumb idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where they are at, but they export people who will perpetuate those same 
</EM><BR>
dumb
<BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas elsewhere.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hear, hear!
<BR>
<P>The only &quot;dumb idea&quot; here is that resources are finite,
<BR>
<P>They are.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;and that it is
</EM><BR>
even possible to &quot;overpopulate&quot; an area.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>It is.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Julian Simon and others have
</EM><BR>
done a good job of debunking those.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>I doubt it.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Opening your borders with any economy that does not behave as yours does 
</EM><BR>
only
<BR>
<EM>&gt; opens your own economy up to being degraded by its association.
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite so. Also, it's quite stupid to sell, for example, advanced weaponry to 
<BR>
hot-headed barbarians.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If we opened immigration to everyone that wanted to live here, we'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shortly have 6 billion people living in the US, starving to death.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Oh, poppycock.  We'd have 6 billion people making the biggest,
</EM><BR>
strongest, cleanest, most diverse, most magnificent economy the world
<BR>
has ever seen, assuming the government doesn't intervene to screw it up.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Oh, COME ON, you don't really believe that, do you? What would really happen 
<BR>
is this: the poor would come all right, by the millions. Most of them would be 
<BR>
completely unskilled, and unable/unwilling to change this. Some would get very 
<BR>
crappy jobs, most of which can and should be done by machines. They'd be 
<BR>
exploited by all sorts of entrepreneurs, put to work in sweat shops and the 
<BR>
like under no doubt pretty inhumane conditions. Others (millions) would refuse 
<BR>
to work, or be unable to find work, so they'd beg, rob and steal from the 
<BR>
&quot;rich white man&quot; whom they hate anyway to support themselves and their rapidly 
<BR>
growing families. Crime, including the worst forms of violent crime, would 
<BR>
flare up to South African levels and beyond, forcing anyone who could afford 
<BR>
it into heavily defended ghettoes/settlements (of course, many would simply 
<BR>
leave for Europe, Canada or some other still civilized place, exactly as the 
<BR>
white South Africans are doing). Large parts of cities and the country as a 
<BR>
whole would eventually be turned into &quot;no-go&quot; areas, just like the current 
<BR>
ghettoes where gang bangers rule, only much bigger, meaner and ridden with 
<BR>
diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis.
<BR>
<P>The huge, dissatisfied underclass of poor immigrants would be an easy target 
<BR>
for opportunistic agitators, and the already decimated, weak and decadent 
<BR>
(predominantly white) ruling class would eventually be forced to hand over 
<BR>
power -one way or another- to various &quot;local&quot; dictators/war lords. The last 
<BR>
vestiges of civilization would then fall prey to ransacking, wanton 
<BR>
destruction or simply neglect, and the US would be turned into 3rd world 
<BR>
country.
<BR>
<P>Poor countries usually are the way they are because the people there don't 
<BR>
have what it takes to create a prosperous, civilized society. You can blame it 
<BR>
on their big bad governments, but let's not forget that those governments are 
<BR>
just as much an expression of local culture as anything else. Corrupt 
<BR>
societies produce corrupt governments. Along with the immigrants you import 
<BR>
all their problems, and beyond a certain point your country will go to Hell. 
<BR>
Harsh as it may sound, this is the the way things are, and (immigration) 
<BR>
policies should be based on the truth, not on ivory tower chit-chat.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;But even that is less likely--with an influx of immigrants, states
</EM><BR>
would be falling over themselves to eliminate welfare laws and
<BR>
other handouts so that the people would /have/ to be productive.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>And this is a good thing!? Welfare is an integral part of civilized, modern 
<BR>
societies. Your libertarian visions of hordes of people doing stupid manual 
<BR>
labor for a pathetic salary and without any social safety net harken back to 
<BR>
the early days of the industrial revolution. Really, you don't want to go 
<BR>
there. Hordes of miserable, poorly educated (if at all) wage slaves operating 
<BR>
primitive and often dangerous machinery is the way of the past; small, highly 
<BR>
automated societies with very strict immigration policies and various free, 
<BR>
high-quality services (health care, for example) for all citizens are, or at 
<BR>
least should be, the wave of the future. Anything less would be a retreat to 
<BR>
barbarism.
