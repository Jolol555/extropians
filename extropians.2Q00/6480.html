KPG SAID: &quot;...Thus, the program runs quite well in the beginning of its life
<BR>
cycle, then to became less and less runnable with increasing uptime.  The
<BR>
more complex life forms use a repeated reboot method to get rid of this
<BR>
problem.
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: Very true. It's also a bit deeper than that...it's a more complex
<BR>
tradeoff... yes, you could produce shortlived individuals who are very
<BR>
fecund versus long lived individual who are less fecund.
<BR>
<P>Yes, it's harder to evolutionarily engineer very long lived individuals
<BR>
because such fitness represents a global optimum on the fitness landscape.
<BR>
Many many fixes have to be made to a highly specialized metazoan cell. The
<BR>
reboot is more local an optimum.
<BR>
<P>BUT, there are also distinct ADVANTAGES to short life... the main ones being
<BR>
genetic adaptability because of the increased genetic mutation and
<BR>
recombination.
<BR>
<P>That's why bacteria can run evolutionary rings around humans.
<BR>
<P>Even in creatures like smart mammals and smart birds, where memetic
<BR>
adaptability counts, shorter life often means greater adaptability.
<BR>
<P>It's only when the meme pool is of necessity huge and stable and meme
<BR>
replication rates comparatively slow, e.g., elephants, macaws etc. does long
<BR>
life become especially favourable in evolutionary terms.
