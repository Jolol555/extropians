In a conversation about self-delusion and real possibilities, I (Mike)
<BR>
wrote:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; That being said, I must confess that we, too, can fool ourselves into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believing that uploading, or resuscitation from cryonic storage, or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; singularity, etc. will happen soon enough for us all.
</EM><BR>
<P>Spike Jones replied:
<BR>
I dont understand.  Resuscitation from cryonic storage stage has
<BR>
no time limit that I know of, and the tech to freeze and store is with
<BR>
us already.
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
In principle, the time limit for storage in liquid nitrogen is virtually
<BR>
unlimited (meaning in the range of millions of years before quantum flux has
<BR>
any discernible effects). But I am not so sure that current suspension
<BR>
techniques provide adequate protection against cellular damage due to ice
<BR>
formation. The photomicrographs I've seen look pretty bad in that respect.
<BR>
My guess is that techniques will improve over time such that the last
<BR>
generation of &quot;corpsicles&quot; will probably be the first to be resuscitated
<BR>
because they will have suffered the least post-animation cryonic stress.
<BR>
That makes Dr. Beford (#1 suspension) last in line for resuscitation, with
<BR>
our cohort coming along only a little before him. (That's not really so bad
<BR>
in my opinion. Based on my best guess about future history, I'd really
<BR>
rather thaw out around 2250 than sooner, because I expect human society to
<BR>
have passed through its tumultuous &quot;adolescence&quot; by then.)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An even bigger problem is the &quot;peasants with pitchforks&quot; scenario (another
<BR>
reason I'd hope to be reanimated later). Unless we can make cryonics
<BR>
acceptable (non-objectionable) to society at large, we leave ourselves (now
<BR>
and in stasis) vulnerable to the kind of violence recently visited upon WTO
<BR>
delegates in Seattle. This is where we all need to work now at spreading the
<BR>
good word about our ideas. (Disseminate those memes!)
<BR>
<P><P>Spike Jones:
<BR>
The singularity, on the other hand, is likely going to happen
<BR>
all too soon.  {8-|  I havent decided if that is a good thing or a bad
<BR>
thing.  {8-|
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
Vernor Vinge agrees with you on both counts. I reserve judgment. I am
<BR>
waiting to see a proof-of-concept AI before I get too excited. When I was a
<BR>
senior in high school (waaay back in 1970) I wrote a paper about the coming
<BR>
of AI. At the time, I believed all the &quot;AI is just around the corner&quot; hype I
<BR>
read. Needless to say, it didn't happen. Once burned, twice shy.
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; (But there could still be hope! After all, Tipler could be right and we'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all be resurrected as immortal emulations at the Omega Point.
</EM><BR>
<P>Spike Jones:
<BR>
Tipler's notion is completely additive: if other immortality bids fail,
<BR>
his idea might still somehow come thru for us.  I estimate cryonics
<BR>
gives you about a 10% chance of resurrection, Tipler adds another
<BR>
1% or so, Singularity deciding it likes you: 5%, nanotech/uploading
<BR>
about 20%, all other notions including traditional religion, negligible.
<BR>
So the good news is we have better than a one in three chance of
<BR>
indefinite survival, and yes I acknowledge the possiblity I am fooling
<BR>
myself.  {8^D  spike
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
Those are not really such bad odds -- whether you are fooling yourself or
<BR>
not! IMHO, it really boils down to a version of Pascal's Wager (i.e., I
<BR>
paraphrase: &quot;If God does not exist and I believe in him, I lose nothing; if
<BR>
God exists and I do not believe in him, I lose the chance for eternal life.
<BR>
Ergo, believing is the best bet.&quot; This presumes, of course, that God
<BR>
requires your belief before he'll resurrect you.) By this reasoning, our
<BR>
best gaming strategy is to pursue any and every chance at life extension
<BR>
and/or immortality that does not exact unacceptable costs in the present.
<BR>
(Unfortunately for some, the price of a cryonics contract is still
<BR>
unacceptably high right now.)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding a Tiplerian resurrection/emulation, Anders Sandberg has pointed
<BR>
out that, short of Tipler's Omega Point, a similar resurrection/emulation
<BR>
could be possible via AI superobjects (Jupiter/neutron star size/density AI
<BR>
brains) albeit for a less than universal coverage of the deceased. (How do
<BR>
we get on the resurrection/emulation waiting list? Maybe this Extropians
<BR>
list is IT!)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in time, I'd rate Anders' idea as the more likely of the
<BR>
two.
<BR>
