<EM>&gt; &gt; No, a free market requires that companies:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1) refrain from using physical force to coerce others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2) abide by the terms of any contracts they voluntarily agree to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 3) refrain from committing fraud (in a narrow sense) in the course of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; business dealings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That's it. Nothing else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't agree.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A free market requires that companies don't use physical force to coerce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others; it _also_ requires that they don't maliciously try to damage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a competitor by using bribes to remove their customers. I use the term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;bribe&quot; here in the sense of some inducement that ties the acceptor into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some form of behaviour.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you were talking about bribing government officials to misuse the power
<BR>
of the state, I would agree - although I think the idea of establishing a
<BR>
rule of law in the first place already covers this.
<BR>
<P>In the sense that you mean, however, the idea makes no sense. The goal of
<BR>
any business is to &quot;maliciously damage&quot; all of its competitors to the
<BR>
greatest extent possible. There is no meaningful difference between damaging
<BR>
your rival by producing a better product than he does, by selling it for
<BR>
less than he charges, by giving his customers a special 'competitive
<BR>
upgrade' price, or by paying cash to anyone who will sign a contract stating
<BR>
they won't use his product. These are all manifestations of the same
<BR>
process.
<BR>
<P>If you think it makes sense to ban this kind of behavior, you aren't arguing
<BR>
for regulation at all. You are arguing that markets are inherently
<BR>
unworkable and should be abandoned in favor of some other system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Classic case: Microsoft's offer (and threat)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to Vobis, that they'd supply Vobis with MS-DOS and Win 3.1 licenses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a pittance, _and_ buy up their existing DR-DOS licenses, _if_ Vobis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signed an exclusive deal with Microsoft (to supply MS-DOS on _every_ PC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their sold). This action wasn't taken in order to make Microsoft money;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it was taken in order to remove a major customer from Digital Research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and _prevent_ them selling back into that market.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, no kidding. So what? A free market is not some feeble slipshod
<BR>
contraption that has to be constantly guarded against the possibility that
<BR>
someone might actually &lt;gasp!&gt; play to win. Instead, it is to be expected
<BR>
that almost all organizations in the market will constantly be engaged in
<BR>
this sort of behavior. That is how markets work.
<BR>
<P>If you leave the market free to work, instead of immediately calling for
<BR>
government intervention, you will discover that it deals with these
<BR>
'problems' just fine. As Standard Oil discovered a long time ago, you can't
<BR>
eliminate competition by buying out all your competitors. If you try it,
<BR>
that just encourages people to start up competing businesses, sell them to
<BR>
you, and then turn around and use your money to set up still more
<BR>
competitor. In the end you're just giving away money to your rivals.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A second point: you didn't ask what the consequences of allowing cartels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be. For example: personnel costs are a major overhead for all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies. Assume a cartel forms; the members can all agree to cut
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their wages by 50%. The usual employee response -- walk to someone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pays a sensible wage -- is no longer valid in this scenario because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is a conspiracy to set prices between the companies in their market.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cartels have the classic problem of any conspiracy - the more successful
<BR>
they are, the greater the rewards are for someone who cheats. In a medieval
<BR>
economy, with a tiny number of competitors in any given market and virtually
<BR>
zero chance of new competitors moving in, cartels still needed the force of
<BR>
law behind them to hold together. In the modern world, they are possible
<BR>
without government intervention only in those rare (and becoming rarer)
<BR>
instances where some scarce natural resource vital to the business is
<BR>
controlled by a very small number of producers.
<BR>
<P>In the computer industry, the idea of a cartel is downright silly. Your wage
<BR>
cartel could never get started, because the first companies to try it would
<BR>
immediately loose all their skilled workers to companies that still paid
<BR>
market wages. Even if you miraculously got tens of thousands of independent
<BR>
businesses to all sign up at once, each member would be under constant
<BR>
pressure to pay a little extra for the best workers. It won't be long before
<BR>
someone caves in, and they you go right back to competition.
<BR>
<P>In summary, cartels are inherently unstable in a free market. They require
<BR>
their members to act against their own short-term self interest, and they
<BR>
necessarily create incentives for their members to break their own rules. I
<BR>
know of no example of a private cartel operating in a free market. Even in
<BR>
partly-socialized markets, where the competition that would normally bring
<BR>
them down has been hobbled by government regulation, cartels tend to be both
<BR>
rare and short-lived.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Exactly what companies compete on is up to their customers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not really. The _final_ consumers probably never get a say, if there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a supply chain. I don't get a choice in the products on sale in my local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supermarket; the supermarket decides what it's willing to stock, and all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I get to do is choose between brands.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is true only if the supermarket has no competitors. If you have three
<BR>
supermarkets, six drug stores, and thousands of online stores all competing
<BR>
for your dollars you will find the middlemen spending big bucks to try to
<BR>
figure out what you want them to stock.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One of my co-workers used to work next to the Censor for Scotland. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; censor was simply the buyer for all videos, computer games, and books
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the largest distributor chain in Scotland, one with 30% of the market.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If he chose not to stock something, the _other_ distributors would avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it on the assumption that the something wouldn't be profitable -- thus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; locking the something out of 90% of the retail market.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This guy had no legal standing, was not a government employee, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; officially didn't exist. Nevertheless, he kept videos he disapproved of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of a national-level market, and there was no market feedback to let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his employers know that what he was doing was 'wrong'. (After all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if nobody sells it, its sales potential is zip. Right?)
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't say free markets are perfect. I said that you can't make them
<BR>
better by getting the government involved. Or would you really prefer to
<BR>
have a government agency in charge of mandating what products distributors
<BR>
must and must not carry? Somehow, I suspect that the number of 'banned'
<BR>
videos would have been a lot higher if the matter had been subject to public
<BR>
debate.
<BR>
<P>Economies do tend to have low-competition industries, especially in
<BR>
unglamorous sectors like distribution and sales. However, even there things
<BR>
tend to improve over time. If distributors don't give customers what they
<BR>
want, that creates a profit opportunity that others can exploit. Sooner or
<BR>
later someone always steps up to fill the gap - you can order those 'banned'
<BR>
videos by mail, after all, or on the Internet, or at specialty stores that
<BR>
are willing to go around the distributors.
<BR>
<P>Or at least, that has always been the case in America. If it doesn't seem to
<BR>
be true where you live, I'll bet you there is a law or three making sure it
<BR>
doesn't happen.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Please point me at a controlled crossover experiment that verifies this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experimentally. Until you can do so, I'm going to take this as just more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libertarian polemic.
</EM><BR>
<P>I love the way you casually dismiss a major school of economic and political
<BR>
thought with a shrug and an offhand label. Maybe it'll work for me, too?
<BR>
Let's see:
<BR>
<P>&lt;begin tones of solemn, authoritative pronouncement&gt;
<BR>
<P>Can you provided me with references to the repeatable, double-blind
<BR>
experiments that were conducted to verify your hypothesis? No? Well, then, I
<BR>
shall dismiss your argument as just one more example of socialist poppycock!
<BR>
<P>&lt;end tones of solemn, authoritative pronouncement&gt;
<BR>
<P>Did I convince anyone? No? I didn't think so.
<BR>
<P>Look, if you want to argue about whether or not markets work at all, I'll be
<BR>
happy to start a new thread on the topic. I've got an entire bookshelf of
<BR>
references for my position, from the days of the Roman Republic right up to
<BR>
the present. Socialism, OTOH, has nothing but vague intuitions and a long
<BR>
track record of failure. I think that we both know who's going to have the
<BR>
most evidence at the end of the day.
