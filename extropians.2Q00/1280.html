[...snip Michael Lorrey's details of the CCW application process...]

<EM>&gt; Are you kidding me?  This is supposed to convince me that people who carry 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guns are the most &quot;squeaky clean and non-violent people&quot; in society?  That, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as you like to say, is rich!
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Private citizens who have CCW permits are statistically among the least
<BR>
likely individuals to commit a violent crime, and many times less likely
<BR>
to commit a violent crime than a police officer in most locales.  In
<BR>
fact, individuals who don't even own a gun are more likely to commit a
<BR>
violent crime than a CCW holder in most cases.  The CCW process pretty much
<BR>
selects for responsible, law-abiding citizens.  And it takes very little
<BR>
for the sheriff to revoke it once it has been issued.
<BR>
<P>With such an excellent record, it is no wonder that CCWs are being offered
<BR>
in more and more places; you are statistically much safer around a CCW
<BR>
holder with a gun than a police officer with a gun.  You may find it
<BR>
incredible, but CCW holders really do represent one of the most upstanding
<BR>
segments of society.
<BR>

<BR>
<EM>&gt; Clue:  the cops who killed Amadou Diallo and the cops who sodomized Abner 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Louima and the cops in LA's Rampart Precinct who apparently routinely 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; framed, beat and shot innocent people *all* passed the same sort of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; background test you're talking about.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>How much of a background check cops actually have to go through varies
<BR>
from barely any to extensive depending on the locale.  Like politics, the
<BR>
people who are actually interested in being cops are usually the least
<BR>
suited.  These are not the same kind of people who hold CCWs.
