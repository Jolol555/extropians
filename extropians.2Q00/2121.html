<P><EM>&gt; That phenomenon is interesting, and seems to be an effect of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  interesting interaction: (1) I read all posts made, in order, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  no heed to poster or thread; (2) When I see any opinion or idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  expressed that I have strong opinions about, I respond with my own,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  quoting only the words being responded to; (3) You and I seem to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  interested in similar topics, but come at them from nearly opposite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  points of view; (4) I'm frequently rude.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that we have different opinions, but not opposite. On some issues I 
<BR>
agree with you 100%, and on others I think your &quot;rudeness&quot; manifests itself 
<BR>
in your ideas.  Rand was terrifically correct diagnosing societal ills, but 
<BR>
she was so sadly lacking in compassion that she was unable to find solutions 
<BR>
to work in action.
<BR>
:]
<BR>
<P>You are, of course, free to call me a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  boorish ass, and I will not object.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would not presume. It's simply not in my nature to insult, unless I am 
<BR>
joking around.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; : even more than politeness in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  general I have no respect at all for patronizing paternalism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If you think I should give you a break because of your gender,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  think again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>Darling, your being called a gentleman has nothing to do with MY gender. It 
<BR>
is a term for well bred, well mannered behavior in men. Gentle + man. If you 
<BR>
despise such a term, so be it. However, if you practised being a gentlemen to 
<BR>
among gentlemen, you will find more receptive audience.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I agree, but there's lots of stupid ideas, some of mine included.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I will not cripple the effective communication here by coddling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  people's feelings instead of telling it like I see it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Coddling implies that you think that if we have feelings when you insult us 
<BR>
we are babies. We are not babies. I have an aversion to blatant disregard for 
<BR>
courtesy. OK, I hear you that YOU think it's a disease, but I assure you, I 
<BR>
am a healthy individual and courtesy is favored as a value by many.
