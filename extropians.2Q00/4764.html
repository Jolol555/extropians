<P><EM>    &gt;the part you snipped out  about a blue shift / red shift in the black body
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;background radiation along  the axis of 'real' motion is clarifying. [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;Does the apparent existence of the privileged subset B  have physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;consequences other than the dipole moment in the black body
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;radiation background?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see how it could, although it's true that If the universe is spherically
<BR>
symmetrical and moving in a non chaotic manner then there is only one frame of
<BR>
reference that could observe that symmetry. As you point out, we know the Earth is
<BR>
not in that frame because we observe that the 2.7 K black body background radiation
<BR>
is not spherically symmetrical, it's slightly blue shifted in one direction and red shifted
<BR>
180 degrees in the exact opposite direction by the same amount. However that's
<BR>
not a preferred frame of reference, at least not as Einstein used the term.
<BR>
If you were in a sealed metal elevator you could not detect the black body radiation
<BR>
through the metal and no experiment performed inside that elevator could determine
<BR>
if you were moving in that frame of reference or not.
<BR>
<P>One the other hand, if 19'th century physicists had been right and the luminiferous
<BR>
ether actually existed then there really would have been a preferred frame of
<BR>
reference, you could always tell if you were in that fame, even if you're in a sealed
<BR>
metal elevator. Forget the outside world, just measure the speed of light in several
<BR>
directions, if the speed is always the same then you know you're in that special frame
<BR>
of reference, if the speed depends on direction then you can't be in that frame.
<BR>
Einstein junked the luminiferous ether and thus a special frame of reference too.
