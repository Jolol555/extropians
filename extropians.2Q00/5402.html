<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Also what is to keep Iraq from placing a nuclear warhead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; on a ship and sailing it into New York City harbor?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Here's a scarier scenario, from a old report to the USCG forecasting turn 
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  the century law enforcement requirements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Most/many currents are constant and predictable, put someting in it, let it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  go, and you know woth fair accuracy where and when it'll be down the road.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  There are bouys called so-fars -- they only rise or sink sofar, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  depth can be set.  These are old technology.  Hook a device of mass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  destruction (nuclear or biologocal or chemical) to a sofar, put it in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  current and let it go.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  When it goes off, whom do you blame, where do you retaliate, how do you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  adequately guard against it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I am only amazed that a terrorist group has not yet used this method!

<P>Thinking up ways for Bad Guys to smuggle in and deliver WMDs to First World 
<BR>
cities is sort of a morbid pastime for me from time to time.  Having spent a 
<BR>
lot of my career working in the maritime industry, I've come up with a 
<BR>
foolproof way to smuggle a nuke into the US with zero risk of detection and 
<BR>
capture.  Here's the plan (which would make a nice part of an action movie, I 
<BR>
think):
<BR>
<P>1.  Nuke is placed on a marginal cargo ship (there are LOTS of them around).  
<BR>
This could happen in, say Karachi, after making its way overland from Russia 
<BR>
through Afghanistan.  How the nuke gets out of the hands of the Russian army 
<BR>
and across the border into Afghanistan is left as an exercise for the reader.
<BR>
<P>2.  The freighter is bound (legitimately) for some port in the Caribbean - 
<BR>
anyplace will do.
<BR>
<P>3.  In the middle of the Gulf of Mexico, the &quot;Package&quot; is pushed overboard.  
<BR>
The Package is a so-far buoy, with a smart sonar system.  The system is 
<BR>
quiet, but listening.
<BR>
<P>4.  Bad Guys have bought a middling-sized yacht in any US Gulf port.  There 
<BR>
are tens of thousands of boats at slips all along the Gulf Coast, and their 
<BR>
comings and goings are of no real interest to the Coast Guard.
<BR>
<P>5.  Bad Guys establish a pattern of long-weekend trips out into the Gulf for 
<BR>
recreation.  There's plenty of big game fish out there and thousands of boats 
<BR>
come and go every day for this purpose.
<BR>
<P>6.  Bad Guys head for the coordinates of the drop.  Once there, they start 
<BR>
pinging a signal the so-far is set to listen for.  When the Package hears the 
<BR>
right signal, it starts answering with a steady locator response, making 
<BR>
finding it a snap.
<BR>
<P>7.  Bad Guys haul the so-far up under cover of darkness, using the boat's 
<BR>
light tackle, stash it below decks and head for home, snagging a couple of 
<BR>
marlins on the way for cover.  Upon return to their slip, no one's concerned, 
<BR>
especially not US Customs, because they haven't called at a foreign port.
<BR>
<P>8.  Bad Guys can keep the Package on the boat for weeks until they are sure 
<BR>
no one is watching, and then move it off the boat to a rental storage unit at 
<BR>
their leisure.
<BR>
<P>9.  Delivery is by any number of means.  My favorite is a remotely-controlled 
<BR>
light private aircraft, to provide maximum airburst damage radius.
<BR>
<P>Pretty nasty, huh?  I've got others . . .
