<P>Gross over-simplification and grossly unfair to the republican movement.
<BR>
You omit the fact that the unionists practiced systematic discrimination
<BR>
against catholics up until the late sixties/early seventies. You omit
<BR>
the fun little festivities such as the marching season. You omit the nice
<BR>
guys from the UVF and UFF who are just as partial to murder and maiming of
<BR>
their opponents as the IRA. You omit the complete fuck-up by the British
<BR>
government in 1971-76 -- who, to be fair, didn't have a clue what sort of
<BR>
meat-grinder they were sticking their dick into, and who didn't realise
<BR>
that the Paratroop Regiment *weren't* trained in police and counter-
<BR>
insurgency duties. You omit the fact that even if Sinn Fein is willing to
<BR>
take a moderate route and go into disarmament talks, they *can't do so*
<BR>
unless they can pursuade the Provisionals to go along with them, and that
<BR>
the Ulster Unionists are in the same bind vis-a-vis the UFF and UVF. 
<BR>
<P>Indeed, there's a deterrence issue here. To coin a metaphor: both sides
<BR>
are holding a loaded pistol to each other's head, and you've got the
<BR>
British government off to one side pointing a rifle at the both of them
<BR>
but also trying to talk them down. Nobody wants to shoot, but everyone's
<BR>
terrified that if they lower their gun they'll die. The only solution is
<BR>
to try to build enough trust to let both sides relax their trigger fingers
<BR>
and put the guns away -- but it's hard to do that, because the most radical
<BR>
individuals on either side are in a position to confirm the worst fears of 
<BR>
their enemies, and indeed have a positive motive to do so (because it
<BR>
cements their own importance within their own faction).
<BR>
<P>The problem with insurgencies is that it's very hard for them to stop
<BR>
fighting, unless they have a very strong leader. Whenever one group
<BR>
develops a fit of sanity and decides that maybe negotiating isn't the
<BR>
first step on the road to surrender, their out-voted hard-liners splinter
<BR>
off and start shooting people again. This is a large part of the reason
<BR>
why the troubles in Northern Ireland went on for thirty years, despite
<BR>
there only ever being a couple of thousand people willing to take up
<BR>
arms in the first place.
<BR>
<P>For example, about the only reason we still have a peace process today is
<BR>
because the hard-liners of the Continuity-IRA self-destructed two years
<BR>
ago, by blowing up and killing 26 catholics: that bomb was really intended
<BR>
to scupper the peace talks, but instead it massively alienated their
<BR>
own community (as well as just about everyone else everywhere). But the
<BR>
Unionist terrorists managed to do pretty much the same thing, albeit on
<BR>
a smaller scale.
<BR>
<P>(Moral of story: insurgencies have a way of getting out of control and
<BR>
are very hard to stop once they achieve a life of their own, as long
<BR>
as there's any constituency behind the terrorists.)
