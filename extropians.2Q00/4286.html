<P>&lt;&lt; As I see it, terraforming isn't about creating more planets for humans
<BR>
&nbsp;to live on, but to create more planets for life in its various forms
<BR>
&nbsp;to evolve on. Ecopoiesis rather than colonisation. It is my current
<BR>
&nbsp;opinion that the best places for more or less traditional humans to
<BR>
&nbsp;live in are likely o'Neill style habitats. It doesn't seem likely
<BR>
&nbsp;posthumans would need planets either.  Of course, being able to
<BR>
&nbsp;technologically adapt to odd environments means that (post)humans
<BR>
&nbsp;could visit and enjoy these ecosystems, even when they radically
<BR>
&nbsp;differ from terrestrial conditions, but the ecosystems are a goal in
<BR>
&nbsp;themselves rather than a tool for colonisation.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Personally I want to technoform Mercury by implanting an ecology of
<BR>
&nbsp;replicating machines there.  &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Aha! So we Biotify the solar system and then much of the rest of the milky 
<BR>
way galaxy, so that maybe life (brain-life) evolves?  As far as Gerard O'neil 
<BR>
goes, Freeman Dyson had a point when he noted that it would be easier to 
<BR>
simply inhabit the asteroids and comets by hollowing the insides of these 
<BR>
places and then set them a-spinning to create a centifugal force to imitate 
<BR>
gravity.  Planet Mercury would as Sir Arthur C. Clarke noted in Rendevouz 
<BR>
with Rama, that &quot;with Mercury, the lack of minerals, for humanity, could be 
<BR>
fore-stalled a thousand years&quot;.
