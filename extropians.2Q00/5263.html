(The original reply went to Randall, and Randall responded directly to me; I
<BR>
meant
<BR>
it to go to the list. Thus you wont have seen the messages these are

<BR>
I wont do any snipping!)
<BR>
<P>I'll respond to this message on list when I have a free moment (hour?).

<P>You bet. Jodie and myself have been taking a break (having a second baby,
<BR>
which is not really a break as such). We're hoping to get moving again in
<BR>
the
<BR>
second half of the year (that's soon, isn't it?). The overwhelming feedback
<BR>
we've received about our music so far is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 1 - We need an orchestra
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 2 - Sounds like it's from a musical.
<BR>
<P>We are taking steps to incorporate both of these points; ie:, write a full
<BR>
musical
<BR>
and stage it properly with orchestra, etc. More news as it comes to hand...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Thanks for your reply; I take it that agorists go for a brand of
</EM><BR>
anarchism
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; where you have only the free market, no gov't. Is this correct? Does
</EM><BR>
this
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; map over Libertarian ideas/ideals?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, it is correct, and agorists often call ourselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libertarians.  In the US, using a capital L for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Libertarian usually denotes that a person is part of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Libertarian Party, and most agorists would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be, since we would consider voting to be morally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equivalent to using government force on others.  Some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agorists vote &quot;in self-defense&quot;, though. :)  As with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other libertarians, there is rarely an issue that all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agorists always agree on.  In any case, there are usually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered to be two sorts of libertarian, minarchist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (small government) and anarchist.  Of the anarchist camp,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some call themselves agorists, and some anarcho-capitalists,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the difference is nearly all in the name.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It's been instructive to read what you wrote; I've gone looking for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; information on anarchist systems out there on the net, and can only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; retrieve a lot of indecipherable mumbo jumbo. There are many many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; many idiots out there who like to use the word Anarchy in their web
</EM><BR>
sites.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes. :(  In the US, the best-known group of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people calling themselves &quot;Anarchist&quot; are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violent and/or anti-technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not sure that I agree with this. Fundamentally, you have at some
</EM><BR>
point
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (let's say initially) a system where few people have huge wads of cash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; capital), and the majority have relatively small wads (trivial capital).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you remove the govt &amp; all the intellectual property laws and the like,
</EM><BR>
why
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will the concentrations of capital disperse from the larger holders to
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; marority, trivial capital holders? What mechanism will make this happen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Either the money will be invested, or it will be spent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If it is spent, it's obviously being put in other people's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hands.  If it is invested, then other people are benefiting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from it, just as if it were their money (except for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small amount they are paying to use it: interest).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; must bear in mind that capital concentrates into a small amount of
</EM><BR>
large,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; privately held lumps because those with the capital like to keep and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; increase their stake, and actively work to do so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This would be true if those with the capital were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; naturally better at making it in the first place,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but *if* that were so, it would mean that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were better at meeting the needs of others, so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others are willing to pay them for it.  I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expect, though, in the absence of force, that nearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone would be about the same in ability to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other people happy enough to part with their money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Even without intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; property, limitied liability, tax favours, etc, I think I could hold
</EM><BR>
onto
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &amp;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; increase a major stake (say 1 billion+) at the expense of those around
</EM><BR>
me,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because of the weight that kind of capital carries. I'm very interested
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; know why I am misguided here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here is why I think you are, anyway:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Money cannot be made &quot;at the expense of&quot; those around,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but only with their consent and approval, *unless* you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are using force against them.  If you were able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increase your 1 billion, it would be because other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people were willing to pay you for whatever you were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing with it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; So start your own. :)  Seriously, with the advantage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; of large businesses being almost entirely caused by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the regulations imposed by the State, businesses that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; got as large as most of today's corporations wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; last long: they can't change fast enough to keep up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; with an unregulated market (cf. the internet).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is my point; I'd like to start my own, but the marketplace already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; many players who have lots of stuff - the playing pieces -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and I don't.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The thing to do, then, is to start in a business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that doesn't require lots of stuff.  In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simplest case, this means hiring your skills and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time out to others.  Notice that (in the US, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least; dunno about Australia) the laws which have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been passed by government, at the behest of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with lots of money, are specifically designed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep you from hiring yourself and your skills out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at a fair price, since you'd have to pay extra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taxes on having your one-person business, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jump through lots of hoops, and even then, if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the same customer for more than some certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; percentage of the time, you're automatically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered to be &quot;working for&quot; them.  All this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has the effect of a huge barrier to entry that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't exist without government.  One identifying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feature of agorists is that they usually have one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or more businesses going, without most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jumping through hoops.  I'm no exception (cf.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; www.freedomspace.net).  It doesn't take much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money to start something like this, unless you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually get licenses, permits, a physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; building (since building codes are also designed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to make operating a business in a &quot;residential&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; area difficult or impossible), and all the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuff which is intended to drive up your costs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The cost of complying with that stuff is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; biggest cost of a small business.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'd be interested to see someone here talk about whether large orgs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can change fast enough to keep up. I'm sure there are structures you
</EM><BR>
could
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; build to make this work. For instance, if the enormous hierarchical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; multi-national doesn't work in the agorist economy, why wouldn't I as
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Big Capitalist just break it into lots and lots and lots and lots of
</EM><BR>
teeny
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; weeny, mostly autonomous companies? Then they should gain the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of agility, but I can keep an eye on the big picture, and shuffle my
</EM><BR>
money
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; around to make sure that where they need it, my little companies get an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unfair edge in terms of lots of extra capital. Why wont this work?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If it does work, it will be because you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing enough good to stay afloat.  When you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say that your companies get an unfair edge,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you either mean that it's a wise investment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for them to have more money, in which case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your competitors would borrow to match, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you mean that you're simply spending money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a temporary advantage, which enriches
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other people at your expense.  Remember,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without using force, you can only get people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to give you money if they think that it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worth it, and the easiest way to make them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that is to do good things for them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Money is only coercive when it is used to buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; force.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I say it is coercive in an economic sense; like &quot;Sell me your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; company for 1 billion $US, or I'll spend the same in the market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on aggressive competitive practices designed to destroy your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; market share&quot;. That's coersion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think that unless you can get a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by other means (such as passing laws or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting governmental financial assistance),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any sane businessman would laugh at your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threat.  He would know that you can only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lose money temporarily; you will run out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When you do, he'll make money again, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he can borrow enough to hold over until then,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when he shows your message to his banker.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you have to pull this kind of stunt,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it means that you don't believe that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can provide the service or product at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same value as he can.  Anyway, if he accepts,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you've just reversed your position with his,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and if he was worse off when you proposed this,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then you are now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Agreed, but see above about large businesses.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; sort of behavior wouldn't be profitable without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; substantial assistance from government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yet again, I don't buy this argument that large business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; works solely as a result of a favourable environment due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; solely to the govt. I'd like to hear more about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It isn't so much that &quot;large&quot; only works because of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government, but that the larger you get, the more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overhead there is in communication and coordination
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between the various parts.  People aren't able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep track of more than a few people at once, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to get around this, you have to have more layers of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; management, just to keep track of the same events.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Those extra layers are deadweight, competitively,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unless being larger gives you some other advantage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Um, no, that would be force.  Money is just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; an indicator of where it would be most helpful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to invest your efforts.  It's a signalling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; system about the needs of others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Money is as you say. The rule of Money, is about power.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; People accumulate really vast amounts of capital to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; able to exert the power that comes with those sums.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Exerting power, means making people do things that they wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; otherwise do, which is also called compulsion or coersion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hm.  If a store has a sale on computer equipment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advertised on their storefront, I might go into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the store to check out the merchandise that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would otherwise have ignored.  Have they used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coercion on me?  I don't think so, since if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buy something that I would otherwise not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bought, it is because I believe that I will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better off buying than not buying.  I would say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; therefore, that causing others to change their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course of action is only coercion if physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; force or fraud is involved, since in that case,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the recipient is *worse* off than they otherwise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have been.  The telltale sign of market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efficiency (which correlates with the lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; force or fraud) is that everyone involved in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular transaction believes that they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better off than they would have been without it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [snipped grocery store example]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There is a flaw in the argument above, as follows:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Either, people only want as much as they can buy, or they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; want more than they can buy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Okay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If they want only as much as they can buy, then what is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; point of money? You need only to allow them to take what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they want; we do not have a situation of scarcity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One function of money is to signal that more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; production of some good will be required in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the future.  If we don't keep track of what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people got that they wanted, then we won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know what to make more of tomorrow.  While
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this could conceivably be tracked with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; centralized system of recordkeeping, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market system (using money) keeps track with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little overhead, and coincidentally provides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an incentive system to perpetuate the system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; After all, if we used the central recordkeeping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system, what incentive would the recordkeepers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have not to walk off the job?  There might also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be other ways of doing this.  In particular,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotechnology will probably reduce the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overhead of producing all your own goods to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; low enough level that large numbers of people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will do that instead of participating in any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market.  I expect to be one of those people. :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If they want more than they can buy, then their individual choice is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thwarted. They must choose less than they desire. So this is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 100% freedom of choice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, but it is limited by production, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by force.  If I am on a desert island, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want coconuts, it is true that my freedom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of choice is limited to either working for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the coconuts (by climbing trees, I guess)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or not having any.  That's just the way the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universe works, and the market reflects that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Further, this warehouse has limited items. Suppose some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people want to buy the same items with their money, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a point where there are not enough items to fill demand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the chosen type? In the warehouse scenario, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; first-come-first-served. A rather arbitrary system of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; redistribution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Maybe the warehouse uses an auctioning system? That way,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; price moves to match up supply and demand (kind of).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This just exacerbates my earlier point that people can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only get the things they can afford with their money (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so are quite restricted in terms of choice).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Finally I think the most major point here is that some people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have a lot more money than others. Someone could walk in with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enough cash to buy everything in the warehouse. Maybe they've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gone without from previous warehouse sales, or perhaps they've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; just inherited ungodly wealth, which allows them to basically go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; around taking things (by offering so much money that they always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; get first choice, esp in an auction situation).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A parliamentary democratic system will divide things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; according to it's own weird and non-obvious decision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; making criteria, but I would contend that the optimality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of this decision could not be shown to be any worse than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that in the money situation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you divide the selling and production into &quot;rounds&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or &quot;turns&quot; for clarity, then:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the first round, the parliamentary decision-making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be no worse, probably, than the market system,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since we have no idea what the starting conditions are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (what is available, who has more money).  The parliamentary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system, though, will never get any better.  The market,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though, contains its own signalling system for more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; production in exactly the areas that are required: those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; products become more expensive when there are fewer than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needed.  So in the second round, the market system will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be more efficient than the parliamentary system at getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people what they want, and every round thereafter will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become more efficient until it is as efficient as it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gonna get.  This level of efficiency will likely be far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better than the parliamentary system, even if not perfect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (because of the lag of one production-to-market cycle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is built in to the system).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If you now took that monopoly away from MS, they still have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more money than God. This means, they can poach the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; employees, employ highly expensive &amp; effective marketing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; techniques (including negative techniques for crushing perception
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of competitor products), influence complementary businesses to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stop trading with their competitors, and many, many other kinds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of really awful competitive practices.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But without being able to force people to pay for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things that they already have, they'd just be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spending money.  In other words, they'd either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to become a competitive organization, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entails providing value for money, or they'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spend until it was all gone.  Remember, too, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they don't hire people at really high salaries,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but instead at normal salaries with high stock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; portfolios.  If they no longer had a monopoly on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Windows&quot;, they'd have to provide other services
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to survive.  The stock price would plummet, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they'd no longer have all that money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By the way, those expensive marketing techniques
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't very effective.  They can only afford those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as long as no one else can sell copies of Windows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My idea is, no doubt, someone else's, who stole it from me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; before I thought of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'll post it seperately.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alright.  Did you bcc this to the extropians list?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It doesn't appear to be in the cc field.  Anyway,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel free to forward to that list, if you wish.
</EM><BR>
