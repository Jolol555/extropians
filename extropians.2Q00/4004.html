<P>
ME: &lt;she had neither talent nor education in art&gt; 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  Isn't this merely a call for credentials?  Does anyone think she was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  unacquainted with works of Modern Art?  Or is QueeneMUSE demanding       
</EM><BR>
someone
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  have an art degree from a prestigious school before opening one's mouth or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  putting pen to paper?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Most explicitly, No!  
<BR>
Degrees are nice to have, they get respect, and yes, people will take you 
<BR>
more seriously, But Ph.D.'s don't hold the patent on the knowledge. 
<BR>
Libraries, the Internet, art classes, all good. Many free. But the desire 
<BR>
must be there, and an open willing mind. 
<BR>
<P>If one is an artist, one SHOULD learn these things. But to critique and not 
<BR>
sound bilious, one MUST.
<BR>
<P>ME: &gt; Her entire outlook was sneering, venomous, self-important and smug. If
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; instead of spending so much time on self absorption she had gone to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; trouble to educate herself on the current artscene, I'd have had more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; respect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  What would have educated her in this regard?  I have a feeling that only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  adulation and praise would qualify for QueeneMUSE as education.  Prove me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  wrong!  Please prove me wrong.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>Tsk Tsk, you have a feeling? ; P .... Daniel, objectivists can't go by their 
<BR>
FEELINGS, haven't you learned anything from your Goddess? ; ) just kidding... 
<BR>
<P>First of all, let me tell you my name, it is Nadia. No, I don't want her to 
<BR>
praise Pollock and other 1950's modernist art, in fact she would have like my 
<BR>
work better, it's figurative realism, and very conservative. Last time I 
<BR>
looked at a Pollock I was sadly disappointed. (Which I'll go into below).
<BR>
<P>What would have qualified her as a valid person to critique ANY sort of art 
<BR>
would have been simple: *knowing what the standards are* instead of making 
<BR>
her own and calling them objective. It's kind of like saying: If I don't like 
<BR>
it, it's shit. Deal with it.
<BR>
<P>There are standards for art education. The main four ones are:
<BR>
<P>VISUAL PERCEPTION:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ability to see and understand concepts in art. Line, color, 
<BR>
form, negative space, balance, materials, techniques. such as collage, 
<BR>
airbrush, trump l'oiel, assemblage, casting, scumbling 
<BR>
What &quot;visual terms&quot; do artists use to express unity, movement, emphasis, 
<BR>
space, and texture, etc.? Visual perception is an ability to recognize the 
<BR>
processes that made the art as well as to understand the final composition 
<BR>
and meaning, if any. Artistic perception is learned through comparisons and 
<BR>
identification of these elements.
<BR>
<P>CREATIVE EXPRESSION:
<BR>
Creating, performing and participating in the arts. Doing art. Developing the 
<BR>
knowledge and skills in a variety of media. Applied knowledge. This is the 
<BR>
most common form of art knowledge. Many here on the list do this part, with 
<BR>
great success!
<BR>
(For Ayn Rand her media was her writing -- which she mastered brilliantly. To 
<BR>
my knowledge she never attempted any visual art).
<BR>
<P>HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL CONTENT: 
<BR>
This is the understanding of contributions of the culture that the art comes 
<BR>
from, and the history of art before. It looks at what was happening 
<BR>
historically while art was being made.  What is the content of art in various 
<BR>
times and periods and locations and cultures throughout the world? What was 
<BR>
the role of visual arts in human history?
<BR>
<P>AESTHETIC VALUING: 
<BR>
The ability to analyze, interpret and derive meaning from works of visual 
<BR>
art. Judgments made about and determining the quality of art *in accordance 
<BR>
with the learned elements and principles at work*. 
<BR>
<P>So you can see:
<BR>
Adulation and praise have nothing to do with a good crit. Her potshot at 
<BR>
Pollacks work was to call it little better than a &quot;drunk vomiting on the 
<BR>
sidewalk.&quot; Nice. 
<BR>
<P>Again: I see her as emotionally reactive, sneering, derisive and smug ... Vs. 
<BR>
well balanced, aware, educated, worldly, calm and knowledgeable. 
<BR>
<P>Hope this cleared it up for you.
<BR>
<P>PS: 
<BR>
I really do think her whole problem was her pathological dislike of anything 
<BR>
she couldn't control. 
<BR>
<P><P>PSS:
<BR>
Now I will give you my (rather un-erudite) take on Pollock:
<BR>
<P>Jackson Pollock was a product of his time. I do not look at this work today 
<BR>
and find it very interesting, except from a historical perspective. What is 
<BR>
interesting is the variations that he spawned, including one of my favorites, 
<BR>
Rauschenberg (SP?).
<BR>
<P>At the time, Pollock made a huge, bold statement about what art was, and what 
<BR>
it wasn't. He freed up a huge roadway for a new breed of painters. His use of 
<BR>
composition, color and space was so radically different from what people were 
<BR>
used to seeing, that he sent shockwaves through the art market that are still 
<BR>
reverberating. He had a sense of humor too! 
<BR>
He did indeed, as Natasha Vita More (who is much more qualified than I to be 
<BR>
a critic) says, 'Think outside the picture'. He presented the art world with 
<BR>
a better understanding of itself and of it's collectors. At the time I was 
<BR>
not yet born, but as a small child I remember liking his work. But now, as an 
<BR>
adult, when I see it, it looks like art that comes from another time period, 
<BR>
and it has not held up well. It has huge cracks and is literally falling off 
<BR>
the canvas. This reminds me even more that he was a product of his time -- 
<BR>
and was painting to make an effect on the consciousness of the art world. To 
<BR>
open our minds!
<BR>
<P>There are several parts to creation. Craftsmanship is one, conception another.
<BR>
Some visionaries are not particularly good craftsmen. A lot of art's main 
<BR>
driving force is it's &quot;idea.&quot; 
<BR>
Laymen and people who like art that 'looks like stuff&quot;, will say that art is 
<BR>
good if the artist is &quot;drawing well&quot; . It is easy to praise to art that looks 
<BR>
as if it takes much practice and discipline, if only for the work ethic!! 
<BR>
.... but this does not equal &quot;good&quot; art, only well rendered.  
<BR>
<P>Pollock pulled the rug out of modern art as well rendered, well composed 
<BR>
stiffness -- and the rest of the art world owes him for that, even if we look 
<BR>
at his paintings today and they look a little bedraggled and trite.
