<EM>&gt;Subject: RE: what if microsoft disobeyed the breakup?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Date: Fri, 9 Jun 2000 18:03:23 -0400 (EDT)
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If I'm Microsoft, I can tell Dell to ship a copy of Office with every &gt;PC 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or I'll decline to license them my OS and put them out of business.
</EM><BR>
<P>So? Is it not your OS to do that with?
<BR>
The assumption people often make about regulation of the economy is that by 
<BR>
engaging in an economic transition, you suddenly enter a sphere where you 
<BR>
are now working for society, which is justified to, through government, 
<BR>
force you to put your products on the marketplace at terms which are most 
<BR>
beneficial to them, not to you.
<BR>
Whether this assumption is correct and noble is one point to debate. But, if 
<BR>
you agree that it is a bad premise, consider what it would mean to apply 
<BR>
your arguments to any other sphere of human relationships besides the purely 
<BR>
economic. What if you were really attractive and had a great since of humor, 
<BR>
and had a lot of romance in your life as a result. Everyone you date, if 
<BR>
they are monogamous to you, is being taken out of the pool of potential 
<BR>
mates that others could be dating. The solution to this argument would be to 
<BR>
perform some kind of plastic surgery to make you uglier, or perhaps limit 
<BR>
the amount of jokes you can tell in a day. Suppose everyone you've dated, 
<BR>
you have broken up with, suppose it is hundreds. Obviously you're breaking a 
<BR>
lot of hearts, there should be some committee to determine ways to prevent 
<BR>
this in the future.
<BR>
The knee-jerk reaction I think, is that what you do in your sexual and 
<BR>
romantic life is a very personal thing, and that your business practices, by 
<BR>
implication, are not. This is the fundemental (and un-realized) disagreement 
<BR>
I think between those who would put unneccessary regulations on businesses, 
<BR>
and those who would not. Many people, especially the ones who actually run 
<BR>
businesses, feel as passionate about it as an artist feels about their art, 
<BR>
and this passion and sense of rage at anyone who dares regulate them is 
<BR>
completely justified.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If I'm IBM and I don't like something your startup is doing, I can do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a search on my patent database, find a couple of dozen you could plausibly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be violating, and - right or wrong - bankrupt you in court.
</EM><BR>
<P>If right, then good, if wrong, then yeah that's a problem. I think whenever 
<BR>
anyone loses a case that they initiated, they should have to pay the loser 
<BR>
double his legal fees.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Putting aside the issue of whether Windows is any good or whether Microsoft 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or IBM or whoever actually does or did things like that, should they be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;allowed to?
</EM><BR>
<P>On the issue of accusing another company of stealing a patent when they did 
<BR>
not: no.
<BR>
Regarding the issue of refusing to sell their products to people, for ANY 
<BR>
reason they want: yes they should be allowed to, just as much as you should 
<BR>
be allowed to not buy them for any reason you want. It's puzzling to me how 
<BR>
anyone could believe otherwise. Why is them refusing sale of a product 
<BR>
somehow different from the customer refusing purchase of it? If someone does 
<BR>
not buy Windows because he believes Gates is part of a Zionist conspiracy, 
<BR>
then quite obviously that individual is insane and is failing to buy a 
<BR>
product for a ridiculous and harmful reason, but how absurd would it be to 
<BR>
force him to buy it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Why would we want to let them?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know why you would want to.. I would want to because I'd like to 
<BR>
live in a world where I'm free to produce something and offer it for 
<BR>
exchange on 100% my own terms, and where everyone else is allowed to do the 
<BR>
same, because it will result in the greatest variety of products and means 
<BR>
to exchange them.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Gates isn't evil, he's just an asshole, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Windows wouldn't have succeeded if it didn't have some merit.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they're not very nice people, and, having often watched them trample
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people smaller than themselves, I can't really muster much sympathy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when they're abused by someone bigger yet. Live by the sword, die by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the sword. I am not greatly moved by MSFT's uncomfortable discovery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the world is an unfair place or that it too can be the victim of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dirty tactics. Nor will I shed a tear for the property rights of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;richest man in history.
</EM><BR>
<P>Gates is indeed an asshole, today there was an article - I seem to remember 
<BR>
it being on wired.com but it's either been removed or it was someplace else 
<BR>
- it's about MicroSoft joining several others in a complaint against AOL for 
<BR>
their unfair business practices. They obviously have no principles, and this 
<BR>
action by them leads me to believe that they see the business world as an 
<BR>
arena in which anything goes, in which there is no such thing as &quot;fair&quot; or 
<BR>
concept of rights, and in which the only rule is: if you can get away with 
<BR>
it, do it. MS is the lesser of two evils, but not for the reasons most 
<BR>
people point out. Still, I want them to win, not because they're good and 
<BR>
deserve it but because it sets a precedent. Just like I am glad that Larry 
<BR>
Flynt was not convicted for obscenity, even though he's a skumbag, and just 
<BR>
as I am sad that Dr. Kervorkian is in prison for helping people take 
<BR>
ownerships of their own lives, even though what they did with that ownership 
<BR>
was wrong.
