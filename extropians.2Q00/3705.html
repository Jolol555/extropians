<P><EM>&gt; This guy sent me a link to his site after reading my review of &quot;The Selfish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Gene&quot; on Amazon.com...  I don't know whether to laugh or run away in fear...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I really haven't a CLUE what he's talking about.  Any ideas?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>Sure.  He's a physics grad who spent some time &quot;seriously
<BR>
investigating&quot; various so-called &quot;pseudo-scientific&quot; New Age/&quot;New
<BR>
Science&quot; stuff.  He found it bunk.  However, he's also disillusioned
<BR>
with a lot of so-called &quot;scientists&quot; as well, especially Roger
<BR>
Penrose, whom he sarcastically argues to be the head of the field in
<BR>
both studies of the human mind and quantum gravity.
<BR>
<P>His writings feel odd because he challenges the bad arguments of each
<BR>
side, New Age vs. &quot;New Science&quot;, with the worst arguments of the other
<BR>
side.  Rhetorically, this would have been more effective if he had
<BR>
explained what he was intending to do before he did it, but it works
<BR>
anyway, once you're set to receive the charge.  The object is to leave
<BR>
you, in the end, very disappointed in both.
<BR>
<P>He rejects them both, leaving us only with the lame duck exhortation
<BR>
to think think rationally.  In the end, he endorses &quot;rational&quot;
<BR>
science, but doesn't say much about what that is.  Other than the fact
<BR>
that it has something to do with what Carl Sagan and Arthur Clarke
<BR>
were talking about.
