<P><EM>&gt; I am trying to explain why killing this current version of Harvey Newstrom

<EM>&gt; is not an acceptable way to give me immortality.  Believe it or not, other

<EM>&gt; people are arguing that it is.
</EM><BR>
<P>This gets discussed a lot in &quot;Flight of the Cuckoo&quot; (that I've mentioned
<BR>
before).  I don't see an easy way out of it.  In situations where an
<BR>
&quot;indentical&quot; copy results from a destructive readout process, you really
<BR>
are standing in a swamp if you object to it (which seems to be Harvey's
<BR>
position [though I haven't read the entire thread]).  Particularly if
<BR>
the *only* way to make you immortal is to undergo a transformation
<BR>
that is an integral part of the desctructive readout.  As I pointed out
<BR>
at Extro3, your chances of attaining &quot;immortality&quot; increase with the
<BR>
size you distribute yourself over.  As structured, we cannot distribute
<BR>
ourselves at all.  Distributed intelligence is required to avoid local
<BR>
&quot;accidents&quot;.  (Interestingly, distributed intelligence is also &quot;slow&quot;
<BR>
intelligence, so the more &quot;immortal&quot; you are, the slower your &quot;clock&quot; rate).
<BR>
<P>Moravec's article pointed out, I think, the need to avoid thinking of it
<BR>
in terms of &quot;me&quot; or &quot;my copy&quot;.  More acceptable is to think of it as
<BR>
&quot;a pattern&quot; and &quot;copies of a pattern&quot;.  Then you have the issue of
<BR>
whether the patterns are &quot;run&quot;, diverge and develop individual &quot;rights&quot;.
<BR>
Whether the destruction of one pattern to create an identical pattern is
<BR>
an &quot;acceptable way&quot;, presumably depends on personal taste. 
<BR>
<P>Now, the way I think of it that works for me, is hoping that the nanobots
<BR>
can sit on my neurons for many years, distilling information, sending
<BR>
messages between my brain and my &quot;mind&quot; in my distributed computer
<BR>
network.  As the computers become increasingly powerful more and more of
<BR>
my mind is in the machine rather than in my brain.  Eventually my brain
<BR>
has an fatal accident, dies of natural causes, gets put on ice or
<BR>
donated to medicine by my computer side for teaching 1st year med students.
<BR>
What I then do with my &quot;mind in the machine&quot; is another thread.
<BR>
Certainly I can make inactive backup copies and distribute them.
<BR>
Or I can distribute my mind over a large number of processors and
<BR>
hardware architectures for safety.
<BR>
<P>Now of course, if you &quot;play it safe&quot;, distribute yourself as much
<BR>
as possible, that likely puts you at an evolutionary disadvantage
<BR>
to people who choose to remain small and fast.  So if a competitive
<BR>
economic environment exists, rather than say a &quot;moral&quot; environment
<BR>
where resources are distributed by agreement, immortality falls
<BR>
victim to ruthless competition.  Only in organisms at the &quot;top&quot; of
<BR>
their ecological niches (or in rare cases those with extraordinary
<BR>
defenses) get to develop the systems that can maintain themselves
<BR>
over increasingly longer time periods.
<BR>
<P>So the only paths I can see where immortality is feasible are
<BR>
(a) Grab all the resources you can as fast as you can;
<BR>
(b) Develop a collective moral system where the society allocates
<BR>
you resources and values your preservation; or (c) take a very fast
<BR>
ship someplace where there are unallocated resources and you are
<BR>
far enough away from people that you have time to build yourself
<BR>
into an SI before anyone else colonizes your resource base.
<BR>
<P>I'm partial to (b), but I don't see an easy way to implement it
<BR>
since you have to trust that nobody is pursuing (a) and humans
<BR>
are not inherently &quot;trustable&quot;.
