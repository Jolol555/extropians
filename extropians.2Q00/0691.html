<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Literally by your intepretation, yes, however the US has never 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;brought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;an anti-trust suit against a foreign company.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Wrong again.  The US sues foreign companies *all the time* under the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sherman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Act.  The first time it was done successfully was way back in 1945 in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; case of US v. Alcoa (148 F.2d 416).  Alcoa was a Canadian corporation 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; was sued for acts committed *entirely* outside the borders of the US.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; long as your business has a sufficient impact on trade in the US, it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't matter where you are based or where you do business.  There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; really no dispute about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Alcoa: ALuminum COmpany of America..... hardly Canadian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Morover, ALCOA (Aluminum Company of America) was sued because it had 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;obtained a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;total lock on all aluminum mines in Canada of any consequence. As that was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only supplier of a strategic resource metal to our refineries on the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Columbia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;River, and its primary customer was the US Gov't, it was obviously a quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different situation. Since that was 1945, you might remember that we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;happened to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be at war at the time, and aluminum was necessary for airplane 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manufacturing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ALCOA executives were also convicted of war profiteering....
</EM><BR>
<P>And so?  Your claim, remember, was that &quot;the US has never brought an 
<BR>
anti-trust suit against a foreign company.&quot;  I have no idea where you got 
<BR>
that from, but I was merely pointing out that that is simply not even close 
<BR>
to being true.  The Alcoa case is not the only case where this happened.  It 
<BR>
is the landmark case where Judge Learned Hand first held that the Sherman 
<BR>
Act can be used against a foreign company, even if the claimed acts all 
<BR>
occurred outside the US border.  There have been *many* others since then.
<BR>
<P>All of which goes back to the original argument (getting back somewhat to 
<BR>
the thread subject) that moving to a foreign state would not do MS any good 
<BR>
in terms of their antitrust problems.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
