<P><EM>&gt; and deepest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  philosophical meaning, Elian Gonzalez must be allowed to remain here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Let this poor boy have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  chance to live a human life. If &quot;compassion&quot; is one of our politicians'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  chief values, as they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  keep telling us, can't they show him any of it?
</EM><BR>
<P>You know, this really irks me, since objectivists are supposedly AGAINST the 
<BR>
state saying what we can and cannot do with our children.  A call for 
<BR>
compassion is the last thing I want to hear from this camp of followers, who 
<BR>
blatantly say that compassion should not be a value.
<BR>
<P>(I loved the part about how the father has no rights since he's  Commie and 
<BR>
in his country *has* no rights.. ; - ) 
<BR>
<P>The situation, is, quite frankly, none of Leonard Peikoff's business. Ayn 
<BR>
Rand is dead, &amp; no doubt she'd have vitriol against Cuba, but she hated 
<BR>
communists for her own personal reasons above and beyond the obvious 
<BR>
unworkability of the system. She had plenty of bile for the whole movement 
<BR>
and anything that smacked of it. We can explain that pathology, since the 
<BR>
communists ruined her life in a dramatic way. She even went to trial against 
<BR>
so called Commies in Hollywood. She was right, of course, and the system has 
<BR>
failed.
<BR>
<P>But communism is not the issue here, is it? Quality of life is the issue, 
<BR>
yes, of course, and I would rather live here, too, and raise my kids here. 
<BR>
But it's not for me to say what his another's child's fate should be.
<BR>
<P>As far as I am concerned, Eliezer's right: 
<BR>
This whole charade is one huge &quot;pure headline-hungry hypocritical 
<BR>
slime-grubbing&quot;
<BR>
codependent bunch of crap.  More TV smoke and mirrors to keep the public's 
<BR>
eye on something other than the real deal. My TV rolls endless footage of him 
<BR>
playing happily in Miami while millions of kids *right here in the US* die of 
<BR>
starvation or beatings -- or go to jail for gangbanging or drugs.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey Leonard: I got yer &quot;compassion...&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;oh... And my favorite part is how he proclaimed the Mayor of Miami, a 
<BR>
&quot;political hero&quot; for &quot;Americanism in its original and deepest philosophical 
<BR>
meaning&quot;  
<BR>
; - )  DOH!
<BR>
The Mayor is courting his voting constituency who would not reelect him if he 
<BR>
did otherwise. 
<BR>
<P><P>Think about this:
<BR>
Whatever you may think of communism, if the Cubans tried to keep one of your 
<BR>
youngsters against your will, if you were his only surviving parent, Cuba 
<BR>
would be smacked down so fast your head wouldn't even spin.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
How absurd.
