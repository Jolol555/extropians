<EM>&gt; There are in history some examples of civilizations which gave up major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technologies.  I believe it was China, where gunpowder was invented, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people gave up guns after having them for some time. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The Chinese never really used gunpowder as more than a curiousity, and
<BR>
they never invented anything that could properly be considered a gun in any
<BR>
conventional sense.  It was the Europeans (the English first, I believe)
<BR>
who figured out how to use it as an effective propellant and explosive for
<BR>
military and other purposes.
<BR>
<P>Historically, the Chinese have a rather strange record of invention.  They
<BR>
made many important discoveries and developed many exceptional
<BR>
capabilities, but very rarely did they expand or exploit these
<BR>
developments.  Part of it was cultural -- there was little room for
<BR>
profit-making on invented technologies.
<BR>
<P>Another example of this is Chinese shipbuilding in the late 15th and early
<BR>
16th century (IIRC), which was around the time the Portugese were the
<BR>
dominant European sea-faring nation.  Towards the end of the 15th century,
<BR>
the Chinese took an interest in shipbuilding and proceeded to produce very
<BR>
fine ships, some of which were over twice as long and had ten times the
<BR>
displacement of the largest European vessels being produced at the time. 
<BR>
They sailed these around Asia and into the Indian ocean, trading with
<BR>
local merchants and occasionally with the Europeans by proxy.  By the
<BR>
1530's though, the Powers-That-Were decided that there was no value to
<BR>
being an sea-faring society and had the enormous ships dismantled.  Had the
<BR>
Chinese exploited their excellent shipbuilding technology to its fullest,
<BR>
the world might be organized differently today.
<BR>
<P>The Chinese are an interesting example of a society structured in such a
<BR>
way that the impact of technology on the social order is reduced to an
<BR>
abolute minimum.  I don't think most of us would be comfortable in that
<BR>
type of environment, but it does describe a stable form of change
<BR>
suppression that has a long history of working well in isolation.  If they
<BR>
had not been faced with the more aggressively competitive environment
<BR>
created by the Europeans, I suspect China today would have changed little
<BR>
from its historical forms.
<BR>
<P>(While I think I got all the dates and facts correct, I didn't check them
<BR>
against my references, so I may be off a bit.)
