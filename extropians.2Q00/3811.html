<EM>&gt; &gt; Any infrastructure facilities are strategic targets. TV station =

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No time to comment on everything this morning, but the above point of view
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clearly means Lorrey means anything and everything can be redefined as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; military target.  In other words, any war is always total war and any nation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engaging in war that thinks it has right on its side -- and what nation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to war claims it doesn't -- can bomb and kill indiscriminately.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, that is NOT what I mean. You cannot specifically target civilians, private
<BR>
buildings that don't contribute to the war effort (and propaganda is a
<BR>
contribution to the war effort, so a TV station IS a legitimate target),
<BR>
hospitals, schools, prisons, etc. However, there is a difference between
<BR>
targeting a non-combatant, and accidentally killing a non-combatant through
<BR>
collateral damage while in the course of attacking a legitimate target. Any
<BR>
civilian with brains will stay as far away from any military target as possible.
<BR>
Bridges are and always have been considered primary military targets.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I recall the bombing of the train bridge.  The pilot saw the train after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dropping his first load and went back and bombed again.  The NATO spokesman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claimed, &quot;He bombed in good faith.&quot;  What, pray tell, would bombing in &quot;bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faith&quot; be?
</EM><BR>
<P>Bombing in bad faith is specifically bombing a target that you are aware has a
<BR>
large number of non-combatants in the target zone. This is called an atrocity.
<BR>
If you drop a bomb, knowing the target is clear, and while the bomb is dropping
<BR>
a non-combatant runs into the target area, that is not an atrocity, that is
<BR>
stupidity on the part of the non-combatant.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; There was a very good documentary done on Dresden not too long ago. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; British were the ones who specifically ran a two wave HE and incindiary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mission against Dresden, while the Americans came along later with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; targeted mission against a neighboring military facility.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Soviets actually asked the British and Americans to target the city.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tens of thousands were killed.  The military targets in Dresden were road
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and rail centers.  In order to minimize civilian and refugee deaths, all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that would have been necessary was targeting these outside the city.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bombing took place in February of 1945.  The war ended a few months later.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This was not material to ending the war -- any more than turning over people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the Soviets after the war was material to keeping the peace.
</EM><BR>
<P>General 'Bomber' Harris was the British commander in charge of the British
<BR>
bombing raid, he heard the Americans were going to target a few military targets
<BR>
around Dresden, and he was so competetive that he HAD to bomb Dresden first, so
<BR>
he sent up the British mission. I do happen to think that Harris should have
<BR>
been tried for war crimes, as a matter of fact.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Now, are you saying the Germans were housing POWs in the city, as human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shields? That, in itself, is a war crime.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Germans, to my knowledge, did not know Dresden was going to be bombed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Up until February of 1945, to my knowledge, Dresden had never been heavily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bombed AND it was not a military center -- being mainly an &quot;arts&quot; Mecca.
</EM><BR>
<P>They didn't know when any place was going to be bombed. That is not an excuse.
<BR>
Most all POW camps were built outside population centers and away from
<BR>
industrial sites to avoid that kind of thing.
<BR>
<P>Note: We frequently bombed military industrial facilities where Jewish slave
<BR>
laborers worked. Should we be blamed for their deaths?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [big snip I'll to get to later...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; We don't kill the kids.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who is this &quot;we&quot;?  Is Lorrey calling the shots down at the Pentagon?
</EM><BR>
<P>You are blaming America in general, and I am an American, so it is 'we'. I note
<BR>
that you avoid replying to the rest of my comments here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [another big snip I'll to get to later...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Notably, Saddam has not been stopped.  He continues to rule and seek
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ways to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; expand his power, the coalition against fell apart mainly because of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; US's and Britain's highhanded policy in the region, and the general
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lesson
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; every other nation and people is being taught is that might makes right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Kosovo is much the same.  Milosevic is still in power, now the KLA is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; killing Kosovar Serbs, the genocide that never was is generally ignored
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; because it's not news, Serbia might be bombed out but it's army is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and Russia used the American strategy to its advantage in Chechnya.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the two -- Chechnya and Yugoslavia -- are different is one that will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; be explained to me.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, there is little difference, with the sole exception being that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Serbs started killing ethnic albanians first,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I recall some 45 people were killed before the bombings began.  And, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, the claims of the KLA Are to be beleived while any Serb sources are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; total liars.  Genocide on a scale to match...  Waco not Hitler.  I suppose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that justifies bombing all of Yugoslavia AND killing thousands of civilians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the process.
</EM><BR>
<P>There were far more than 45 people killed. Where are you getting your
<BR>
information? By the time we started bombing, there were hundreds of thousands as
<BR>
refugees and thousands of people killed, raped, and being used as human shields.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, the bombing against Yugoslavia seems to not have stopped the killings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the region, but escalated them.  Was this the goal?  I don't think so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One should, after all, go to war with the notion to making things better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In other words, one fights because one thinks that the peace afterwards will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be better than the peace before the fight.  This should make war the means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a higher end and actual military actions can then be measured against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether they work toward this end or detract from it.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the Serbs did not want what is happening to them now, they should not have
<BR>
given free reign to those who perpetrated the slaughter and rape of thousands of
<BR>
ethnic albanians. What comes around goes around.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yugoslavia is interesting in another way.  The US had no vital interest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there.  It did not affect any US allies in a big way.  (If it did, why has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the trouble in the Balkans for the last ten years not bothered them?)  Also,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US policy in the region has been markedly pro-Islamic and pro-German.  I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not trying to bring a conspiracy angle in here, but it's strange to see the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US standing by while Croatia cleansed itself of Serbs by the tens of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousands, while not being able stand Serbia hold on to Kosovo and the death
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toll being orders of magnitude smaller.  (Croatia is a nation which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; celebrates its alliance to Nazi Germany and exterminated approximately a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; third of its population during WW2.  This does NOT mean I'm prepared to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support a bombing campaign against Croatia TV and rail lines, civilians or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Croatia did not slaughter thousands of Serbs, they evicted them. They also
<BR>
received a good number of Croats that were evicted from other areas. Tudjman
<BR>
wais not a saint, he was a thug as well. Most Americans, and I'm sure our
<BR>
government as well, does not consider any of the leaders in the former
<BR>
Yugoslavic states to be nice people. They are all thugs and bullies. All we can
<BR>
do (and what the Europeans should have been doing but were to lazy and self
<BR>
involved to pull their heads out of their asses) is try to keep the peace in a
<BR>
very volatile situation, or else we might as will blockade the whole area and
<BR>
give them all the guns they want so they can shoot it out until they've settled
<BR>
their differences. These are the only two real options.
<BR>
<P>Once again, Europe is asking us to pull their nuts out of the fire, and if we
<BR>
don't do it just the way they want us to, they try to blame us for the whole
<BR>
thing. Sometimes I think we should tell them all to piss off.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; while in Chechnya, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Chechens started killing Russians first. While Serbia is small enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that we can do something about it, there is little we can do about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Russia except diplomatic protests.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My point was that Russia could make the same claims about Chechnya that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lorrey could make about Yugoslavia.  In fact, the Russian policy with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Near Abroad and breakaway republics like Chechnya and Ingushtia has been to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claim that ethnic Russians are being persecuted -- a claim not completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without merit -- and use this as a pretext for intervention.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course. And given the level to which fundamentalist Muslim terrorists are
<BR>
percolating and penetrating in the 'Stans' these days, I'd be very worried and
<BR>
willing to take action too if I were in the Kremlin.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; It's a shame that the American people will have to pay for these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mistakes --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and not the politicians who make them.  But that's the nature of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beast.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How are we going to pay for them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Americans will pay through blood and treasure, of course.  With the former,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is terrorism and war which will claim American lives.  I'm not saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is a justification for this, but merely human nature.  The orphaned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Iraqi or Serbian kid who turns to terrorism is not going to think about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; morality the same way Lorrey (I hope!) and I do.  He or she is mostly going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be motivated by revenge against the US.  That urge would not be there if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the US had either a) stayed the f*ck out it or b) been a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; restrained and civilized in flexing its muscles.
</EM><BR>
<P>Funny, until we started bombing, bleeding hearts like you were crying that we
<BR>
were not doing enough to stop Milosevik. When are you ever going to be
<BR>
satisfied?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The treasure part includes property lost to terrorism and war as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taxes paid to fund the current policy of military adventurism of the US.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But also, the price will be paid in many other ways -- a less stable world,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for one.
</EM><BR>
<P>As long as there are people who hate their neighbors just because they go to a
<BR>
different church or have a different accent, and are willing to kill them for
<BR>
these differences, then the world will be less stable. Its did not start with
<BR>
us, and cannot be blamed on us.
