<EM>&gt; House Votes to Ban Per-Minute Internet Access Charges
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If Internet users were charged by the minute when they surfed the web or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; e-mailed their friends and family, it would drastically increase the cost,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and dramatically inhibit the use, of the Internet.  This bill would help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep the Internet affordable for all Americans.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's good to see these guys can get something right.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see this as &quot;getting it right&quot; at all.  In the short run, this
<BR>
is one regulating agency patching a problem created by another, made
<BR>
necessary because of the artificial monopoly they both created.  But
<BR>
in the long run it will make access /more/ expensive, not less, than if
<BR>
both agencies got out of the way and let the market work.  In a free
<BR>
market, prices are lowest when they are structured most closely to the
<BR>
reality of the costs of producing the product.  Network access time is
<BR>
a scarce commodity measured by time; two minutes of access time really
<BR>
is twice as valuable as one minute.  If consumers are forced by law to
<BR>
buy it by the month and average their use, some group of consumers will
<BR>
realize that they can overgraze the commons by hogging their full month
<BR>
and subletting time to others; and they don't have the infrastructure
<BR>
that the original providers do for maintaining the equipment, supporting
<BR>
users, etc., so they will contract for those services from the original
<BR>
provider at the expense of the its non-hogging customers, further
<BR>
increasing costs, etc., etc.  It's cheaper just to cut out the middle
<BR>
and let the big boys sell minutes in the first place.
