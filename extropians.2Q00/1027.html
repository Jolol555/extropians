<P>What Charles Simonyi calls &quot;Intentional Programming&quot; started out as a
<BR>
research project at Microsoft Research in the early 90s. Unfortunately the
<BR>
section on the MS Research site (<A HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/">http://www.research.microsoft.com/</A>) seems
<BR>
to have been taken down a few weeks ago, but there are still two papers
<BR>
online that explain the concept:

<P>MS apparently made the decision to build a commercial software development
<BR>
tool based on this research in late '99, so the research group moved over to
<BR>
production and started hiring more staff. They don't seem to have anything
<BR>
on the Ms web site yet, as you noted (and I'm sure the marketing guys will
<BR>
come up with a better name for it before it is released).
<BR>
<P>This is a very ambitious project, and it may or may not succeed. But if it
<BR>
does, the result will be a revolution in programming practice comparable to
<BR>
the invention of the compiler.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; There are several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; major revolutions in application development coming down the road, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't want to have to wait another 2-5 years for all the pieces to come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; together.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you're so inclined, I'm interested seeing your list of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coming revolutions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure. Here are the big ones I see in the near future:
<BR>
<P>Language-Neutral Components
<BR>
Technologies like COM and CORBA largely solve the packaging problems that
<BR>
made re-use of OOP objects so difficult, while simultaneously allowing
<BR>
programmers working in different languages to share the same building
<BR>
blocks. They also significantly reduce the complexity of building large,
<BR>
distributed applications by providing a much more effective form of
<BR>
encapsulation than has been possible in the past. The change from monolithic
<BR>
applications to component-based apps is already underway, but it will
<BR>
probably take a decade or more to fully run its course.
<BR>
<P>Distributed Application Services
<BR>
Systems like COM+ (and possibly future versions of EJB) make it practical to
<BR>
actually build distributed, scaleable applications instead of just talking
<BR>
about it. This will have lots of minor effects on the way programming is
<BR>
done, but the big effect is simply a vast expansion in the effective
<BR>
computer power available for microcomputer applications. Within a few years
<BR>
it will cheap and easy to spread an app across hundreds of PC servers, and
<BR>
the reliability will actually end up being higher than that of a mainframe.
<BR>
<P>Intentional Programming
<BR>
I've already talked about this one a bit. If it works out, we get a big jump
<BR>
in our ability to deal with high-complexity programming. If not, oh well.
<BR>
<P>High-Level Application Design
<BR>
Combining the first two items above gives you a world where code re-use is
<BR>
only slightly painful and most companies have far more computing power than
<BR>
they need. That means it will finally be possible to raise the level of
<BR>
abstraction used in business software. We can build generalized applications
<BR>
in which things like SQL statements, data validation requirements, business
<BR>
logic rules and even screen layouts are data, rather than hard-coding them
<BR>
the way we do now.  The performance will be slower than the current approach
<BR>
(by a factor of ~2-3), but the effort required to build a typical business
<BR>
app could easily be reduced by an order of magnitude with a good app
<BR>
generator.
<BR>
<P>Those are the big ones I feel most confident of. XML might reach a similar
<BR>
level of impact, if everyone actually does standardize on it for e-commerce
<BR>
transactions, but I wouldn't want to defend the idea. That problem is much
<BR>
harder than it looks, and others have tried the same tactic before without
<BR>
success.
