<EM>&gt; -----Original Message-----

<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20human%20evolution%20and%20artificial%20birth&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGMECMFIAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>

<EM>&gt; I wouldn't at first. While I agree that in vitro wombs make excellent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sense (once the technology is developed far enough) *rationally*,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; childbearing is an intensely emotional, (dare I say it?) spiritual and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socioculturally enmeshed affair that radical changes of it will at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best take time.
</EM><BR>
<P>As someone who has given birth, I'd go for the artificial womb in a
<BR>
heartbeat (and I'd reccommend it to my daughter as well, if she wanted to
<BR>
have babies), if I could be sure that the child weren't missing out on any
<BR>
important aspects of development.  Thinking of the research done on baby
<BR>
humans and non-human primates who were deprived of nuturing bodily contact
<BR>
during the early parts of their lives, I predict that the period in the womb
<BR>
will turn out to be significant for the child.
<BR>
<P>Breastfeeding is another thing entirely. I wouldn't want to give it up. I
<BR>
found it to be a delightful, sensual experience and, from what I hear from
<BR>
mothers who use bottles, far easier to deal with than artificial feeding
<BR>
methods.  And apparently it's emotionally good for the babies as well. But
<BR>
breastfeeding does not require giving birth.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;In many
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cultures, female children are not valued as much as men
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; children.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well now, those cultures may just be...No!  I'm absolutely NOT going to
<BR>
start this particular conversation!
<BR>
<P>Good bye all,
<BR>
Bonnie
