<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, speaking as a non-accountant, I'm in the top income tax bracket --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; paying 40% on taxable income about 28K (pounds, not dollars). I don't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; any recent figures to hand, but the last ones I saw suggested that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; gross proportion of income we pay in tax here is about 39%, compared with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 38% in the USA and &gt;40% anywhere else in the EU. (Sweden, with the highest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; rate, was around 55%.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &amp;28,000 equals, at a current exchange rate of 1 to 1.48, an income of $41,440.00.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Assuming you are single, you have an initial deduction of $5700.00. Thus your taxable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; income is $35,740.00. With no other deductions or writoffs, your tax would be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; following: [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One thing that's different (I believe) between the US taxation system and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that in the UK is the state (and in some places local) tax component we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have.   Here in lovely NYC - about the most taxed place in the US - we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pay an additional 10% above the Federal rate in combined state and local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; income taxes - plus a host of other taxes (among the highest local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sales tax rates in the nation, for example).   This brings the tax burden
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on many Americans up to - and in some cases beyond - European levels.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so. Most state income taxes are deductible from your federal income tax, so the effect
<BR>
is nil. Plus the sales taxes here are a joke compared to what you'd see in europe. The
<BR>
value added taxes do not just apply at the retail end, they are applied at every level or
<BR>
manufacture and distribution..
<BR>
<P>Then you have states like mine, NH, which has no income tax, no sales tax, and the property
<BR>
tax on real estate is $6.60 per $1,000 valuation at the state level and between $5-15 more
<BR>
at the municipal level.
<BR>
<P>Then you have gasoline and other energy taxes. Even with gas prices at $1.50 per gallon
<BR>
here, they are a small fraction of what is paid over there due to their high taxes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most European jurisdictions don't seem to have the notion of multiple levels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of government - often with overlapping functions - that we have in the US -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; local, county, state, federal, all with taxation authority.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here there is a delineation, according to legal theory, between direct and indirect
<BR>
taxation. The federal government can only impose indirect taxes, while the state and local
<BR>
government can impose direct taxes. Local governments impose their own taxation precisely
<BR>
because no state has a ban on unfunded mandates written into its constitution (though we do
<BR>
have it as a law here regarding education), and many state governments like to pass laws
<BR>
requiring people and communities do things without providing funding to get them done..
<BR>
Moreover, many european communities have 'service fees' and things of that sort for things
<BR>
like garbage disposal, street cleaning, and for upkeep of the neighborhood which tend to
<BR>
compose large apartment buildings, so the fees are imposed at a sort of 'condo association'
<BR>
level.
