</EM><BR>
<P><P>This is a very interesting pattern, because I know other people who also
<BR>
fit in the same kind of pigeon holes.  I think each of these pigeon holes
<BR>
are strong manifestations of specific characteristics:
<BR>
<P>1) There seems to be a surprising number of ex-military people on this
<BR>
list (I am ex-Army -- light infantry), and a fair number of rugged,
<BR>
gun-toting, outdoorsy types.  I would attribute this to strong principles
<BR>
of self-reliance.  Still, at first glance I wouldn't expect as many
<BR>
ex-military people to be here as there are.
<BR>
<P>2) Computer/techno nerd describes most everyone on the list and is
<BR>
probably the single most common factor.
<BR>
<P>3) Extropians seem to tend to be health nuts.  There aren't as many &quot;body
<BR>
nazis&quot; as I would expect (too many engineers? :^), but health issues are
<BR>
obviously very important to most people here.
<BR>
<P>4) From my own experience, I would hazard a guess that people tend to be
<BR>
excellence seekers at a level that exceeds that of the general population. 
<BR>
Maybe extropians just have good taste, but I would guess that it is
<BR>
derived from a desire to push life to the next level (whatever that means).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; People are usually most surprised when I am in Mode4 and I refer to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something from my Mode1.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Me too.  Most people aren't even aware that I used to be in the military,
<BR>
nevermind that I have a whole &quot;redneck&quot; way of life that I support. 
<BR>
Since people are much more likely to see me patronizing trendy, upscale
<BR>
cosmopolitan establishments in various locales, they have are very hard
<BR>
time imagining me bouncing through the mountains like a hillbilly or
<BR>
surveying the range on horseback.
