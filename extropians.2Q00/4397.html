This came across as so extreme I had to look it up.
<BR>
<P>A quick Google search reveals
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://urbanlegends.about.com/science/urbanlegends/library/blreno.htm">http://urbanlegends.about.com/science/urbanlegends/library/blreno.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>which claims this &quot;quote&quot; has been passed around the net since at least 1994;
<BR>
and:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's a hoax. According to CBS, Janet Reno did not appear on 60 Minutes in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1994. More to the point, even if she had made such an appearance and even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if she did hold this unlikely opinion, the Attorney General would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have dared publicly utter such impolitic words, which essentially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consign every practicing Christian in the United States to the status of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;cultist&quot; and a &quot;threat&quot; to the society. 
</EM><BR>
<P>(not that I'd necessarily agree that she wouldn't have &quot;dared publicly
<BR>
utter such impolitic words&quot;, given her degree of political cluelessness,
<BR>
but if she had, I suspect we'd have long since heard the uproar through
<BR>
mainstream media.  Not that the quote isn't believable.)

<BR>
<EM>&gt; Yea .. we need cameras everywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;A cultist is one who has a strong belief in the Bible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the Second Coming of Christ; who frequently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attends Bible studies; who has a high level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; financial giving to a Christian cause; who home
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; schools for their children; who has accumulated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survival foods and has strong belief in the Second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Amendment; and who distrusts big government.  Any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these may qualify a person as a cultist but certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than one of these would cause us to look at this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person as a threat and his family as being in a risk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situation that qualifies for government interference.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Janet Reno, Attny.  General of the United States
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; during an Interview on CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on June 26,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1999.
