<EM>&gt; I am curious to know what the list members think will be the real

<EM>&gt; differences between the &quot;haves and the have-nots&quot; a half-century from now?
</EM><BR>
<P>Education, and the mental - as opposed to physical - ability to obtain
<BR>
new information as it becomes available and desirable, will probably be
<BR>
one of the determining differences.  Quite likely, anyone who wishes to
<BR>
do so and knows how to will be able to log on from their home or nearest
<BR>
public access terminal to find answers to the pressing questions of the
<BR>
moment, in degrees of seriousness ranging from the humor behind a
<BR>
friend's light jest regarding something one is not quite familiar with,
<BR>
to the user-created manual on a tool one is using, to auto-generated
<BR>
(and, one would hope, accurate) lists of customers for whatever creative
<BR>
effort one has been inspired to do, to various media embodiments of
<BR>
answers to &quot;how do I do that&quot;.  The main reason the have nots will not
<BR>
be enriching themselves this way, is that they will not know or not
<BR>
think to apply that to their problems.
<BR>
<P>Health is likely to be another distinguishing factor.  Haves: enhanced
<BR>
beyond human norms, rate of death approaching zero - though probably not
<BR>
actually reaching it, unless one excludes death-and-revive (as, for
<BR>
instance, is promised by cryogenic suspension and nanotechnology) from
<BR>
the death count.  Have nots: healthy by 2000s standards, but still
<BR>
suffer from the common cold and such; generally not enhanced much beyond
<BR>
2000-era human norms.
