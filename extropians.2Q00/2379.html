<EM> &gt; Eugene, let me paraphrase your viewpoint into a different viewpoint.  What
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; you are saying sounds similar to the belief that the copy is an inactive
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; backup.  As long as it hasn't been activated or allowed to process a single
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Not really, it is more like keeping mirrors of a server, to be able to
<BR>
smoothly cross over in case the main one fails. Multiple redundancy is 
<BR>
an ancient tradition in mil/aerospace apps.
<BR>
<P>I'm sorry to resort to hackneyed stereotypes, but IT people are
<BR>
familiar with computers, so it is probably a valid analogy. It is not
<BR>
the real thing when discussion uploaded copies, but it does come
<BR>
pretty close.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; thought on its own, it can be deleted.  Since it has never run it's neural
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; processor or processed a single thought, it is more like a standby computer
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; with a backup disk that has not ever been turned on.  Until we turn it on,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; it has never been alive.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
It runs, but it doing exactly the same thing as the other copies. So
<BR>
it doesn't do anything new.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Is this consistent with your viewpoint?  Stated in the above words, I must
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; agree.  An inert backup copy that has never become functional is just a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; backup copy and can be deleted.  Its software program is not running, has
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; never run, and cannot be terminated.  At this point, you are merely
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; destroying one of my backup copies, but not a running consciousness.  Your
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; analogy with abortion is very close here, with this copy ready to be born
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and become alive in an instant.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Notice that software does have state, and can bifurcate. Keeping a
<BR>
mirror of a busy server can be a nontrivial thing, because current
<BR>
systems are complex things with hidden state.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I think I agree with both points of view, and we are getting caught up with
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; semantics of &quot;what is death&quot; and the details of &quot;why&quot; the copy is not yet
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; alive.  I was so distracted by your argument that the copies must be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; identical, that it had not previously occurred to me that the copy had not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; yet been allowed to have independent thought on its own yet.  To put my own
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; semantic spin on things, you are interrupting the process of creating a copy
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and not finishing the final step of giving it consciousness.  Until that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; final step, it is not yet alive.  It is an inert clone of spare parts that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; has not been animated.
