Spike asked:
<BR>
Perhaps John Grigg can help me here:
<BR>
years ago I heard that early Mormons were strictly creationist. One of the 
<BR>
first prophet/leaders,(Brigham Young?) saw in vision the *exact stones* that 
<BR>
Adam used to sacrifice lambs to his god, these being located in Illinois? 
<BR>
Upon closer examination, Adam's altar stones were found to 
<BR>
contain...fossils. [doooooh!]Since that day, the Mormon leadership has been 
<BR>
conspicuously silent on the topic. John, true or false?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I have heard alot of things, but never that story!  I will have to look into 
<BR>
it.  But why could not altar stone's contain fossils?  Mormons do believe 
<BR>
still in creationism but not in the young earth spin of it.  At Mormon 
<BR>
colleges like Brigham Young University (about 27,000 students) evolution is 
<BR>
taught with no apologies.  It is seen as an important part of an education, 
<BR>
especially for future Mormon scientists.  In religious classes and lectures 
<BR>
it may be seen negatively but not in science classes there!
<BR>
<P>I do not think Mormons have the vicious animosity toward evolutionary theory 
<BR>
that evangelicals sometimes have.  But that is my opinion.  An education to 
<BR>
further one's life is seen as extremely important to individual Mormons and 
<BR>
the future growth and power of the church.
<BR>
<P><P>I went to a recent evangelical creationist lecture at my local college and 
<BR>
he proposed the young earth view and even that dinasours lived on the earth 
<BR>
while men did!  I don't buy that.  I told him I tend toward 'old earth' 
<BR>
creationism and think that the Roman empire did not look like the book 
<BR>
series 'Dinotopia!'
<BR>
<P>I want to believe in creationism but see some strong evidences for evolution 
<BR>
(such as the fossil record!).  I could see some good points that the 
<BR>
evangelical lecturer gave in his creationism lecture though, such as about 
<BR>
conservation of energy.  The man had a doctorate in chemistry.  I certainly 
<BR>
admit I need to study much more on the subject to come to a final 
<BR>
conclusion.
<BR>
<P>Last year I did take a class in biological anthropology that helped me to 
<BR>
understand evolutionary theory more then I did before.  The female prof who 
<BR>
taught it should have her own show on PBS, she was a hoot!  You could tell 
<BR>
she had minored in theater while in college!
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
