<EM>&gt;From: &quot;John Clark&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jonkc@worldnet.att.net?Subject=Re:%20Is%20the%20fourth%20time%20is%20the%20charm?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000519070420.84727.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">jonkc@worldnet.att.net</A>&gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The question nobody wants to answer clearly because is would just sound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;too stupid is this:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Question: I've been making and destroying a billion Harvey Newstroms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;every second since you were a one celled zygote, so who is the original
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Harvey Newstrom?
</EM><BR>
<P>Obviously the answer you're looking for is that the &quot;original&quot; Harvey was 
<BR>
the one-celled zygote you started copying way back when.  But I think the 
<BR>
more pertinent question is &quot;who is the original Harvey who knows he is 
<BR>
Harvey?&quot;
<BR>
<P>After all, I belive you realize that *consciousness* is the thing we care 
<BR>
about and want to preserve.  My baby toe on my left foot is just as much a 
<BR>
part of the physical me as any other physical part of me.  But if my toe got 
<BR>
cut off, I would still consider myself to be fully alive and would be 
<BR>
convinced that *I* continue to exist.  So you're right its not simply the 
<BR>
collection of atoms that makes me, it is the constituents of my 
<BR>
consciousness.
<BR>
<P>We could argue until the singularity comes about *when* consciousness has 
<BR>
sufficiently developed so that I realize that I exist.  But, whenever it was 
<BR>
that my consciousness began to develop, that's when the original &quot;me&quot; began 
<BR>
to form.
<BR>

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
