<P><EM>    &gt; Plutonium is just too hard to get,
</EM><BR>
<P>I hope you're right but there are thousands of tons of the stuff and 9 pounds
<BR>
can make a bomb. It's not like money where you can keep track of every cent,
<BR>
whenever you process or machine Plutonium a little sticks to the machinery and
<BR>
is unaccounted for. This worries me.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;too hard to  handle.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd have to be careful or I might get cancer, but if I'm crazy enough to kill a
<BR>
million people I probably wouldn't let a little thing like that stop me.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;He said that the NMD was so vulnerable that it has
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;a number of soft radar sites, so that if any one of these is taken out
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the whole system is useless.  Nowthen, it doesnt take an extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;to figure out that *no* weapon system is designed with multiple
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;single-point failure modes and zero redundancy.
</EM><BR>
<P>One half a megaton explosion 90 miles above Washington would create an EMP
<BR>
that would shut down the entire eastern seaboard power grid and blow out every
<BR>
civilian computer and RADAR from Boston to Atlanta. Perhaps the military stuff
<BR>
is tougher but I'm skeptical, they've got sensitive electronics connected to huge
<BR>
antennas and the pulse is so fast, much faster than lightning, that fuses are useless.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;Production is cheap, way cheap in  comparison to that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cheaper than mass producing simple dumb ICBMs? I don't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Once we design a space based laser system
</EM><BR>
<P>Space based? I didn't know you were talking about a permanent orbital
<BR>
battle station. OK. I'll orbit a much cheaper satellite of my own in a similar
<BR>
orbit but moving in the opposite direction. A modern anti tank gun fires
<BR>
a round that weighs about 5 pounds and moves at 1 mile a second,
<BR>
it can destroy a 70 ton M1 tank. The relative speed of our two satellites
<BR>
is 11 miles a second, 121 as much kinetic energy per unit of mass,
<BR>
so a projectile that weighed about half an ounce could nock out a M1.
<BR>
Your space station will certainly not be a tough as a tank so I think I'll
<BR>
just throw a bucket of sand in your path. Even if you miss the grains the
<BR>
first time every 45 minutes the come around again.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Recall that the photons that come out of the business end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;a laser have *already* passed thru a highly reflective surface.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only one end of a LASER is highly reflective, the other end, the one the beam
<BR>
comes out, is about 50% reflective and with many high power LASERS it needs
<BR>
to be replaced after every shot.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;those who design and build missile defense systems are not hurting for
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;employment. They could make waaay more money elsewhere, but dont.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't believe that for a minute. I think the reasons for the project are bureaucratic
<BR>
momentum and a childish fascination with things that go boom. I'm childish
<BR>
myself and like things that go boom too, but there are limits I will not stoop to.
<BR>
OK, it's easy for me to say that because I'm not an expert on light weight high
<BR>
energy chemical LASERS, but if I was where else could I find a job? It's either
<BR>
star wars or the golden arches, hold the pickles hold the lettuce.
