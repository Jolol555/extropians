<EM>&gt; &gt; There are two things I need to do: sign up for cryonic suspension and

<EM>&gt;get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; an organ donor card. I can do the latter today, and the former in a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; years, when/if I'm earning money. So, the question is: how compatible is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; organ donation with cryonics?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sarah, if you are young, the cost of term life insurance (for say 10 years)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is *very* cheap, probably a few $ a month.  Well worth investigating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as a cryonics &quot;safety-net&quot; until you are earning money.  The question
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to ask yourself is whether your life is worth one or two movies a month?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Sarah, if you want to be frozen after legal death (cryonics), you DON'T want 
<BR>
to be an organ donor. As I understand it, in order to be an organ donor, you 
<BR>
have to be in a certain medical condition with respect to your brain waves. 
<BR>
This may require that a certain period of time pass after you stop 
<BR>
breathing, or something to that effect; in any event, I have heard cryonics 
<BR>
honchos such as Mike Darwin and/or Brian Wowk say that being an organ donor 
<BR>
may well ruin your chances to get a good freeze.
<BR>
<P>Also, if you want to be a cryo, you do not want term life insurance. You 
<BR>
want whole life insurance. With term life, you pay for 20 to 30 years. 
<BR>
During that time period if you die, your beneficiary will get paid (the cryo 
<BR>
org, in this case). After 20 or 30 years (most term is 20 years, but no 
<BR>
longer than 30--and you must pay continuously during those 20-30 years, 
<BR>
AFAIK) your term life insurance is kaput. So if you were to die more than 20 
<BR>
to 30 years from when you buy the insurance, you are out of luck--no freeze. 
<BR>
Plus, at that age, it will be much harder to get life insurance; you may not 
<BR>
be able to get life insurance at all. So there you are at 55 years of age or 
<BR>
thereabouts, with no death benefit life insurance, and you may well be 
<BR>
uninsurable. That's Bad!
<BR>
<P>So, then what you want is called whole/universal/flexible life. This pays a 
<BR>
death benefit no matter when you die, tomorrow, or 100 years from now.
<BR>
Also, you build equity with whole life. You can stop making payments after 
<BR>
10-15 years because the accrued equity pays enough interest to make your 
<BR>
payment.
<BR>
<P>Case closed, then: No organ donor &amp; whole life :^)
