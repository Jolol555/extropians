<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; That's absolutely incorrect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; ActiveX was rejected (by just about everyone, including people using MS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; software) primarily because it's a HUGE security problem. 'ActiveX'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; programs (there's nothing special about them, they're just Windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; programs your machine downloads and runs) would load automatically and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; run with full priveledges on your machine. They could trash your hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; disk, read your files, send your data to someone. ActiveX was an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; absolute *disaster*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; It's only a secondary point It meant people producing content for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Web that was only viewable by people using Microsoft browsers on Intel-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; based computers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Wrong. So long as browsers on other OS's are made with runtime's to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; operate these programs, it really doesn't matter what OS is browsing it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've done this with cobol programs. You can run acucobol programs on any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; machine you want so long as you have the runtimes installed. That is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; failure of other browser manufacturers who refused to implement ActiveX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; runtimes in their browsers simply because it was a Microsoft creation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It is they who were being anti-competetive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Additionally, there is no problem with making a runtime that disallows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (or allows the user to disallow) certain types of system functions, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as Java does. So the only security hole is due to the release of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unready implementation. That is a typical Microsoft fault, premature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; releasing things. I'm sure that many of those suffering from Bill-envy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will extend that failure to his personal life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wrong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ActiveX components are simply Windows executables. Making a runtime for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them would basically mean making a runtime to allow Windows programs to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run on other OS's. This is *not* a simple task, and not one Microsoft is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to allow (they refuse to document the APIs, hence everything has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be reverse-engineered). Witness the Wine project (allowing Windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programs to run on Linux) - which has taken years to get as far as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has, and although an impressive job is *still* only experimental.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would hardly say only experimental. Witness the fact that the whole
<BR>
Corel Word Perfect port depended totally on Wine. The fact WP is running
<BR>
so well on linux now attests to that.
<BR>
<P>You don't need to know what all the undocumented API hooks in Windows
<BR>
are to have a good ActiveX interpreter. You only need it to know what
<BR>
the public will be writing to in their own ActiveX components, AND you
<BR>
can build it to be more secure than MS's own ActiveX implementation.
<BR>
Insisting on knowing every hidden 'feature' of windows is a cop out that
<BR>
non-MS people try to use as an excuse to get under the hood. Its a whine
<BR>
by mediocre coders who want everything to be explained to them and done
<BR>
for them, rather than having to figure it out for themselves.
<BR>
<P>You don't need to know the circuitry of the engine control computer in
<BR>
order to fix a car today, you only need to know how to test it with
<BR>
available diagnostic tools. Likewise you don't need to know how to take
<BR>
apart and rebuild a car in order to know how to drive a car on the
<BR>
highways...
