&nbsp;probably isn't impossible, it just may require more metallic material

&nbsp;than is locally available to accomplish this in reasonable timescales.

&nbsp;The path I outlined does not require that and would seem to have

<EM>&gt;From your previous epsitle which I subsequently hacked and pasted, I took it

to mean that because scientists had not yet discovered Mind-life; that the 
<BR>
logic would dictate that such developments were unlikely to ever occur. What 
<BR>
I was trying to do is say to you is Don't Give Up The Starship. That merely 
<BR>
because intelliegent life is Currently extremely rare, doesn't preclude that 
<BR>
someday, perhaps ump-teen billion years from now, it shall be the rule rather 
<BR>
then the exception. Sorry for the mis-comunication.
