<P>good post john.... ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The book &quot;The B2 Spirit&quot; by Walter J Boyne (an Aviation Week Editor) was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; published just last month, it's clearly pro B2 and yet in the introduction I find this:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;With all the R&amp;D costs now allocated to just 21 aircraft the unit cost has risen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drastically to the point opponents now call each aircraft -not just the program- a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2 billion dollar blunder&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also find that the B2 does not weigh over 400,000 lb as Michael said, the empty weight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is only 125,000 lb and even at maximum takeoff weight it's only 336,500 lb. So when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said the B2 was literally worth its weight in gold I was not engaging in hyperbolae I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually being too conservative, even if you count a full load of fuel and bombs and crew.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I said the military mind is not concerned with cost. Oh well, at least we have the stealth bra.
</EM><BR>
<P>My estimate was based on a) I knew that it was designed to carry 100,000 lb in munitions internally, b) from my
<BR>
USAF experience, I know that for the types of missions the B-2 is built for, fuel demands would be roughly equal
<BR>
to payload size at the very least, up to a couple times the payload size for less efficient vehicles, and c)
<BR>
most all military aircraft have an empty to gross weight ratio of between 1:1.5 up to 1:3. My recollection based
<BR>
on R&amp;D period weight estimates when I was in ROTC seemed to jive with this. The fact that a lot more composite
<BR>
technology wound up being used than was probably originally estimated probably accounts for the low vehicle
<BR>
weight.
<BR>
<P>Beyond the Stealth Bra:
<BR>
John, you and I sitting here couldn't possibly account for all of the technological carryovers from the stealth
<BR>
program to civilian industry. Most of these technology transfers are in the form of new materials, new
<BR>
manufacturing methods, etc. and not actual consumer products. Mundane things like better paint primers,
<BR>
adhesives, etc. are each in and of themselves minor things. Together they are actually rather large
<BR>
contributors. The electroluminescent laptop display found in many laptop computers was developed for the stealth
<BR>
bomber, for example, because they needed advanced display systems for the cockpit that did not use CRT or other
<BR>
technologies that produced large magnetic fields or emitted radio waves.
<BR>
<P>The original point of this particular argument though, is that military R&amp;D is or is not an excellent way to
<BR>
push technological advancement. I still say it is. Possibly not as good as our current economy is, but its
<BR>
better than anything else. Every chip we currently use is based on original generation designs that needed to be
<BR>
compact, durable, and light for use in many military applications, from air-to-air missiles to ICBMs to torpedos
<BR>
and tanks. If we had not had a need to decipher the Enigma and Purple military codes, or design the atomic bomb,
<BR>
it would have taken at least another decade before anyone would have cared enough to invent the first computers.
<BR>
If there wasn't the need for the fastest fighter aircraft on the battlefield, the jet engine would have
<BR>
languished in wind tunnels for another decade as well. If Germany hadn't needed a large ballistic missile to lob
<BR>
a ton of TNT at a whack on London faster than radar could spot them, Robert Goddard's designs for liquid fueled
<BR>
rockets would have languished in the patent archives, never scaled up to large sizes neede to reach space, and
<BR>
he would have died of TB in 1945 anyways as another forgotten nutty professor, and we probably wouldn't have
<BR>
reached the moon to this day. No weather satellites, no communications satellites, no space probes, and no
<BR>
Iridium. If Eisenhower hadn't had a need to get photographic reconaissance of the soviet union after the Powers
<BR>
incident, the Corona program would never have been developed, and re-entry technology would have languished for
<BR>
years, we also would not have developed such high resolution camera technology, so earth resources satellites
<BR>
would never have been developed and oil exploration and archaeology would both have not gotten to where they are
<BR>
today as a result.
<BR>
<P>No cell phones.
<BR>
No cryptography
<BR>
No computers
<BR>
No satellites
<BR>
etc etc etc
