<P>This article is about the GRAPE-6. The last one I had any knowledge
<BR>
of was the GRAPE-4. It's a special purpose computer for only one
<BR>
type of calculation: the Particle-Particle method for calculating
<BR>
forces of an Nbody problem. I've seen this computer used mostly for
<BR>
simulating globular clusters and following the evolution and
<BR>
dynamics of galaxies. They can now evolve a spiral galaxy for 3
<BR>
billion years, noting the spiral patterns in the arms. Also, Makino
<BR>
discovered with his Nbody calculations something called
<BR>
&quot;gravothermal oscillations&quot;.
<BR>
<P>A description of the &quot;Particle-Particle&quot; method that Makino put into
<BR>
his computer hardware can be found here:

<BR>
<P>I published some of the above article in the British trade journal:
<BR>
_Scientific Computing World_ one year ago: &quot;N-Body Simulations Push
<BR>
Hardware and Software Limits,&quot; A.L. Graps, SCW, April/May 1999.
<BR>
<P>The following is from my Nbody methods page, talking a little bit
<BR>
more on this topic, with a photo that I took of a GRAPE-4 computer
<BR>
that is located in a research institute nearby.

<BR>
GRAPE/HARP computer
<BR>
<P>To simulate tens of thousands of particles by a highly-accurate
<BR>
particle-particle method, the computational physicist can expect his
<BR>
simulation to perform at least 10^{14} floating operations. Such
<BR>
considerations inspired the building of the GRAPE computer by
<BR>
Junichiro Makino and colleagues in Tokyo. The GRAPE (acronym for
<BR>
&quot;GRAvity PipE&quot;) computer is built around specialized pipeline
<BR>
processors for computing the gravitational force between particles.
<BR>
<P>Makino et al. has refined the technology further by including chips
<BR>
that perform a Hermite integration, in order to reduce memory
<BR>
requirements and to allow somewhat larger time steps. They call
<BR>
their specialized GRAPE computer: HARP. HARP is the acronym for
<BR>
&quot;Hermite AcceleratoR Pipeline.&quot;

<BR>
<P>This Figure shows a specially designed GRAPE-4 system, the HARP
<BR>
computer, which gives hardware support for a Hermite integration
<BR>
scheme. Photo taken by A. Graps at the Astronomisches-Rechen
<BR>
Institut in Heidelberg, Germany in December 1998. A colleague's
<BR>
watch helps provide the size of this small, innocent-looking

<P><EM>&gt;Robert B (as in Blunt) and Amara (the extropian dust bunny?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(insert smily here)),
</EM><BR>
<P>hee hee. good one.  I had not thought of that use for the term dust
<BR>
bunny.  &quot;Dust bunnies under the bed&quot; is the usual dust joke.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;While they talk about the usual stars and galaxies, they make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no mention of the ever elusive dark matter. If they input data based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on &quot;bright&quot; matter, and then run their calculations, do they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get &quot;junk in gives junk out&quot;, or do they have an opportunity to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;solve for&quot; the distribution and role of dark matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you mean solving for dark matter using Nbody simulations ? I will
<BR>
assume that is what you mean. And there are a lot of different
<BR>
candidates for dark matter. The place that I've seen Nbody
<BR>
simulations used to study the existence of dark matter are the
<BR>
studies when one evolves galaxies with their associated halos, and
<BR>
then looks for MACHOs: Massive Compact Halo Objects. These are the
<BR>
Compact Objects responsible for the gravitational lensing of stars
<BR>
in the nearby (and our own, I think) galaxies.
<BR>
<P>Simulation.
<BR>
<P>Create a small galaxy, like a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (&quot;dSph&quot;). The
<BR>
dSph's are known to orbit the Milky Way at distances ranging from a
<BR>
few tens to a few hundred kpcs. The physical model includes stars
<BR>
and gas of the disk and central bulge (the &quot;visible&quot; matter) plus a
<BR>
function for &quot;dark matter&quot;. The dark matter resides in a spheroidal
<BR>
halo extending far beyond the visible part of the system.
<BR>
<P>Some details: Assume that the galaxy has a smooth gravitational
<BR>
potential, which is solved using various distributions. A
<BR>
collisionless Boltzmann equation gives the stellar distribution
<BR>
function f_s and the dark matter distribution f_d. The interstellar
<BR>
medium is modelled with conservation laws for ideal gas plus gravity
<BR>
and radiative cooling. The gravitational potential is governed by a
<BR>
Poisson's equation where the dark matter function f_d is one of the
<BR>
terms. So then stars, gas and dark matter all move in their own
<BR>
self-consistent potential and the system is evolved over time.
<BR>
<P>Note: Real galaxies have energy sources of turbulent motion,
<BR>
magnetic fields, cosmic rays, and I am not sure how far along the
<BR>
simulations are to have all of these things. There's some extremely
<BR>
advanced hydrodynamics code (like ZEUS3D) running, though.
<BR>
<P>Then this simulated objected is projected onto a &quot;sky&quot;, and its
<BR>
brightness profile, line-of-sight velocity dispersion and _apparent_
<BR>
M/L ratio are determined. These can be directed compared to the
<BR>
observed values for Galactic dSph satellites.
<BR>
<P>Compare to observations.
<BR>
<P>Observations of these dSph galaxies can determine the mass using the
<BR>
galaxy's velocity dispersion, and then after noting the luminosity
<BR>
one derives a mass-to-light ratio.
<BR>
<P>Then one sees what f_d, that is, the dark matter density is
<BR>
necessary to fit the observations (?).
<BR>
<P>So, the above description is what I understand fow how one solves
<BR>
for the dark matter using Nbody methods. I've not worked in this
<BR>
field myself, so I'm just going by my cursory reading of the
<BR>
astrophysics literature.
<BR>
<P>[W.H., if you're reading this, correct me if I'm wrong.]
