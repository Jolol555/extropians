Robert writes, responding to the Nature article:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; These ideas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; were quickly seized on by transhumanists - people who imagine what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; world will look like after technology has rendered us extinct.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, only the grey goo problem would potentially render us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extinct (and Robert F's recent paper casts some questions on those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scenarios) [see below].  I think most &quot;transhumanists&quot; would value the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diversity of a world (solar system?) that includes humans and trans-humans.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a reasonably common belief in these circles that the ultimate
<BR>
future will not include anything that looks remotely human.  I don't think
<BR>
it is fair to say that this is characteristic of all transhumanists though.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The FI fall conference is moving to the East Coast this year, presumably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to make it easier to pull in the East coast conservatives.  Academic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conferences in general tend to move around to educate more people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As it moves, the FI influence may become less, but I don't see any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other organization as likely to come along and &quot;bridge&quot; the various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disciplines that MNT requires.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some of the commercial education organizations have started nanotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conferences, but they are more expensive than the FI conference and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are still much smaller.  NIH is having an NT conference this summer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it is more buzzword labeling than hardcore NT.
</EM><BR>
<P>We will have to see how it plays out.  I still suspect that the mainstream
<BR>
academics will find a way to put the disreputable origin of their field
<BR>
behind them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is interesting to note that among the &quot;technical people&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer programmers and/or systems engineers seem to be those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who can &quot;see&quot; the Drexlerian vision.  Scientists who are simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; devoted to taking things apart (e.g. most health researchers) or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineers who have a micro-focus (e.g. one rivet in an airplane)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't see the big picture.
</EM><BR>
<P>Detractors turn this around and say that the more you know about the
<BR>
actual behavior of matter at the relevant scales, the less credibility
<BR>
you give to Drexlerian nanotech.
<BR>
