<P>...

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Actually I was thinking more of a society of people enlightened enough to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;realize that what's good for the whole is good for the individual.
</EM><BR>
<P>If people were enlightened enough to realize that, wouldn't they be 
<BR>
enlightened enough to be prosperous in a free society? Aren't you saying the 
<BR>
only society in which communism would work would be one where it is not 
<BR>
needed? (I'm of the opinion that the best thing about communism is that it 
<BR>
doesn't work)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It's simply a matter of realizing that the surest way to keep your neighbor 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from stealing your bread is to be sure that he has enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;keep his own belly full.  I call it &quot;enlightened self-interest.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>The surest way to prevent someone from stealing from you is to set up a 
<BR>
government which will steal for you for him? Either way, you're left with 
<BR>
the same amount.
<BR>
It's much more to your self interest to live in a society where someone who 
<BR>
steals from you is considered a criminal, because you are allowed to defend 
<BR>
yourself against him, and he can go to jail. In either case, the result is 
<BR>
that there are less people among the populace who are going to steal from 
<BR>
others.
<BR>
Ensuring that your neighbor has enough bread to keep his belly full is his 
<BR>
resposibility, not yours. He would have more options available to help him 
<BR>
meet this need under capitalism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Unfortunately such a society is unlikely to be stable for long as long as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there is not enough to go around for *everyone*.  But hopefully that minor 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problem will soon be solved by the good folks over at Foresight :)
