<P><EM>&gt; I have seen references to a reluctance to discuss gun control because of

<EM>&gt; something happening on the list a while ago, but I don't know exactly what

<EM>&gt; happened or what the status of gun control discussion is. Someone want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; address this?

<P>There are some hot button issues with which even *we* cant be trusted.
<BR>
{8^D    We did pretty well with the transparent society thing this
<BR>
month, some minor name-calling but fairly harmless stuff: nazi, fascist,
<BR>
downright evil, that sort of thing.  Gave me a chance to practice my
<BR>
downright evil laugh:  Bwaaahahahaha, BWAAAhahahahah, etc.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, in reference to a comment by Queene, I can imagine a
<BR>
circumstance where it would be perfectly appropriate for someone
<BR>
to ask that we keep subject lines clean.  Suppose a young person
<BR>
was using his or her parent's computer, and his or her parent had
<BR>
major hangups about... things.
<BR>
<P>Asking for clean subject lines is not at all an attempt to sensor,
<BR>
nor any kind of request for restriction on what we say *in the
<BR>
messages we post*, its more a privacy thing.  And we can all grok
<BR>
the value of privacy, can we not?  Has it been so long ago for us since
<BR>
our own parents might get all investigatory, should suspicious
<BR>
sounding messages show up in the inbox?
<BR>
<P>Inside the messages you can put any depraved smut you want.
<BR>
I *like* depraved smut, yea, verily, I live for it!  {8^D  spike
<BR>
<P>p.s. Queene, did I miss your point entirely?  If so, please disregard
<BR>
this message.  s
