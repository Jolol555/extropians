<P><EM>&gt; &gt; implication is that as soon as we use a device, say, fridge, TV, car, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; our choices will be uploaded to the Internet and a record will be made of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; every detail of our life.  It will be like having an aircraft &quot;black box&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; recorder in every device. No hope of any privacy here!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  And you know, it wont be as bad as we think.  It never is.  Thousands
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of mechanical sensors will note how we walk, how we smell, the shape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of our faces, and will figure out where everyone is at all times and what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  we are doing, and yet it will be ok.  People will become special, kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of like gods in a way, will we not?  Our machines will look up to us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and respect us and help us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Just thought I would toss this out to see what happens.
</EM><BR>
<P>Two things happened in my head.  First, the memory of Richard Brautigan's 
<BR>
poem &quot;All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace&quot; came to mind - for the 
<BR>
first time in many years.  I wonder how many of the Really Old Timers on the 
<BR>
list remember that poem as a first intimation of transhumanism?
<BR>
<P>Second, I was reminded of an idea I've had for a while (and which was also 
<BR>
sparked by the &quot;Japanese Techno-Animism&quot; discussion), about the rebirth of 
<BR>
animistic thinking in an age of intelligent machines.  (Some of you may 
<BR>
recall me riffing on this idea at the Foresight gathering in May . . .)
<BR>
<P>Consider the deep reservoir of animistic concepts and feelings we have from 
<BR>
our primitive past.  As I've written here before (the &quot;Monkey God&quot; thread), I 
<BR>
think as social primates we are hard-wired to see intentionality in the 
<BR>
world.  Our language is full of such animistic remnants (&quot;it's raining&quot;, 
<BR>
instead of &quot;rain is falling&quot;, for instance).  In pre-modern societies we see 
<BR>
animistic thinking in many institutions and customs.  I like to look at Greek 
<BR>
and Roman societies as some of the West's lenses into the primitive human 
<BR>
mind, since they developed on an immediate past of the &quot;ur-culture&quot; and their 
<BR>
customs and social practices may therefore reflect our hard-wired cognitive 
<BR>
structure more clearly than contemporary society.
<BR>
<P>Roman law, for instance, didn't make clear distinctions between what we would 
<BR>
call &quot;religious&quot; and civic life.  Romans saw the world as being full of 
<BR>
animating spirits.  The &quot;lares&quot; were the &quot;household gods&quot; of the hearth.  
<BR>
&quot;Terminii&quot; were the small gods of borders between landholdings or municipal 
<BR>
boundaries.  A transfer of ownership of a parcel of land involved ritual 
<BR>
invocation of the terminii and communicating to them that a new human being 
<BR>
was invested with the rights of possession and control of that land.  The act 
<BR>
of contract between two people in such a transaction was actually perceived 
<BR>
as a three-way communication, in which, say, Claudius, directed the terminii 
<BR>
of a farm to recognize Septimus as its new owner.
<BR>
<P>As our property becomes infused with intelligence of higher and higher 
<BR>
orders, I can see a return to this kind of social activity.  A truly &quot;smart 
<BR>
car&quot; will not require a physical key - or not a physical key alone.  It will 
<BR>
really recognize its owner and be programmed with behaviors of &quot;loyalty&quot; to 
<BR>
her.  If she wants to sell her car, she will have to tell the car about this 
<BR>
new relationship it is to have.  How ironic that 10,000 years of progress 
<BR>
brings us full circle to the rites of invocation and propitiation of the 
<BR>
animating spirits of &quot;things&quot;.
