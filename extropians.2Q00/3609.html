<EM>&gt; &gt; I gather such laws arose either to overcome local opposition to the law
</EM><BR>
or
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to make it look like politicians are being tough on crime.  I wonder if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anyone has assessed their impact.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since US v Lopez first overturned the law in 1995, gun crime in schools
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has dropped to its lowest level in decades. The current hysteria over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Columbine and other school shootings is so distanced from reality its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insane.
</EM><BR>
<P>It mgiht be insane, but it appears insanity has the day here.  That's why I
<BR>
said, &quot;Don't uncork the champaigne...&quot;:/
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I would not praise them too highly.  In several recent decisions, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; expanded police powers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Miranda ruling was odd, I admit. I would not have been surprised if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they just said that not mirandizing someone was no longer grounds for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dismissal, but removing the requirement entirely was a bit of a reach.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Considering todays education system, you can't expect everyone to know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those rights, although the prevalence of Miranda in tv cop shows has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generated a pretty extensive public knowledge of them.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Miranda ruling was only one of many ruling in the past few years that
<BR>
increased police power.  I cannot cite all of them right now, but if I
<BR>
remember I'll get back to this list on them.  So, if you trust me here, the
<BR>
recent Miranda thing was not isolated.  The usual suspects, especially
<BR>
Scalia, are firmly &quot;law and order&quot; -- regardless of constitutionality.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Assuming he gets elected...  But the problem is, a Conservative Court is
</EM><BR>
no
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; friend to freedom in general.  Surely, we might -- ah, might! -- get
</EM><BR>
some
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gun control removed, but in other areas, such as police power, we might
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more freedoms curtailed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The current Court's ruling philosphy seems to be based on literal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interpretation, original intent, that sort of thing. While it does seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to take a dim view of criminal's rights, it has done very well to hold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up freedom of expression in some areas. For example, Playboy.com just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won a case before the SCOTUS against a law that mandated that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scramble all of their broadcasts occuring during daytime hours.
</EM><BR>
<P>Scalia, in that ruling today, was among the dissenting voices.  Scalia,
<BR>
again, was all for government power.  Justice Scalia, how I hate thee.  Let
<BR>
me count the ways!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other hand, everyone BUT Thomas voted to uphold workplace restrictions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on racist speech (while Thomas is a vocal proponent of free speech, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think his vote was mainly an 'up yours' toward the NAACP and others that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been out to get him and who opposed his appointment.)
</EM><BR>
<P>But do you see the pattern here?  The Court is basically being pulled Left
<BR>
and Right.  This needs to be corrected.  Surely, we could have worse, but we
<BR>
also could have better.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
