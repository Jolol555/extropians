<EM>&gt; &gt; My point exactly, but you and Zero seem to think that some european
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; court is gonna issue an arrest warrant to the FFL to apprehend Bill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Gates from his pad in Medina and that the US Gov't is just gonna sit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; idly by and let this shit go on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I don't believe that. What I _do_ believe is that it's possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that some senior Microsoft France execs may end up doing time, and Bill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will have to take care where his flights land in case some zealous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prosecutor decides to arrest him for complicity if he lands on French

<EM>&gt; territory.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh wow, now Bill is being treated lik Pinochet. That is just OVER the top.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ahem: Champagne and Burgundy are _regions_ of France. Their produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; is appelation controlee, meaning it's graded by quality. This is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; some extent a hold-over from the agricultural age, and you'll note the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; tendency to name modern wines by the grape they're produced from -- which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; isn't a controlled designation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If someone in California makes wine that is indistinguishable from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; champagne to a panel of tasters in a double blind test, it is champagne,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and they should be free to call it that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By that reasoning, if I can make an operating system that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indistinguishable from Windows (presumably by reverse-engineering all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their APIs), I should be free to call it Windows. Right?
</EM><BR>
<P>If there were no current copyright, sure. Champagne has been made for hundreds of
<BR>
years, and its original creators are long dead.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Accepting the claims of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; French for 'cultural heritage', when that 'heritage' is nothing more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than a desire to maintain their elite attitude as being the 'superior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; culture' of the planet is ludicrous.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nonsense. Appelation controlee status is just a variation on trademark
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law, one that you don't recognize because you're a parochial-minded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; American with very little experience of the outside world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Calling Californian bubbly &quot;Champagne&quot; is an attempt to violate the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regional trademark.
</EM><BR>
<P>Trademarks can only belong to one company. Champagne applies to anyone in that
<BR>
region that makes it and uses that process. Region is irrelevant when the end
<BR>
product is the same, and trademarks, like copyrights, are not immortal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Anheur-Busch are still allowed to call their product &quot;Budweiser&quot; in most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; parts of Europe (although in the Czech republic and Switzerland &quot;Budweiser&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; is an apellation controlee and AB's product isn't brewed in the right way or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the right place to carry the name &quot;Budweiser&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Frankly I side with the Czechs. Budweiser (american) sucks. It would do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; us good to make them produce their products to a quality standard (any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; quality standard, just name one...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You realise you've just swapped sides in this argument?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I haven't. If Budweiser used the same standard as is required by the Czechs,
<BR>
with the sole difference being its made in Milwaukee rather than Brno, or wherever,
<BR>
then it is 'budweiser' by rights. The only provincialism or parochialism going on
<BR>
here is by people who think that a product name can be restricted by where it is
<BR>
made.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ahem. How much of Airbus is government owned? I seem to recall some rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; large shareholders that are private companies, like British Aerospace ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess you're just sore because Airbus is outselling Boeing 60/40 at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; present, without the hidden subsidy of military R&amp;D contracts  ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So the government subsidy of the workers benefits packages isn't a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; subsidy????
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of _course_ it's a subsidy! So is the F-22 contract Boeing is feeding off.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What annoys me is the hypocrisy of US politicians claiming that it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfair for Airbus to receive government subsidies when their own big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aerospace contractor is snarfing billions out of the public trough under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rubric &quot;defense spending&quot;, although the government has little or no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interest in buying actual military hardware built with that money. A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good chunk of it ends up feeding into civilian R&amp;D, in much the same way that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Boeing 747 got started as a re-working of Boeing's failed bid for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; C-5 contract.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is a total and utter lie that is promulgated by the Airbus propaganda trough.
<BR>
The 747 was not funded at all by competition for the C-5 contract. Once it was
<BR>
built, it was entered in the competition, but it was from the outset a civilian
<BR>
design. The only current Boeing civilian aircraft product that was R&amp;D funded by the
<BR>
government was the C-135 (737). I suppose you are going to try to say that the DC-10
<BR>
was also funded by the government, but it wasn't. McDonnell didn't sell any to the
<BR>
feds until several years after it was already on the market.
<BR>
<P>I don't care much for Boeing. I do really hate flying on Airbus planes though.
<BR>
Freaking sardine cans, made for chinamen or children.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Look, the issue here is that governments play favourites with their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; domestic markets. And they aren't going to stop, either, because if one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stops, the others will continue; their own companies will enjoy a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competitive advantage, and governments still see companies based on their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soil as strategic assets (paying tax to them).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is an entirely different issue from trademark law, and variants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thereon like the appelation controllee stuff (which doesn't exist in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the USA but is widely recognized as having the weight of trademark
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law elsewhere in the world).  Incidentally, it can be argued that those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Californian bubbly producers who call their produce Champagne have exactly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same relationship to the real thing that Chinese software pirates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have with Microsoft: they're simply infringing a form of intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property that isn't recognized [much] in their home country.
</EM><BR>
<P>Except that the people who originated appelation controlee are long dead, and Bill
<BR>
Gates is quite alive.... a distinct difference.
