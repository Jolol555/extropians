<EM>&gt; &gt;Of course, if you've ever been to a nudist resort, you quickly realize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that you'd rather *not* see through clothing in most cases...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why do you say that?
</EM><BR>
<P>Simple- it was a *joke*.  The real lesson of nudity is that it doesn't
<BR>
matter, and isn't necessarily erotic.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The beautiful thing about what you see at a nudist resort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the sheer (!) number of different shapes and sizes of people.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep- and sometimes those shapes (sometimes arrived at after ill-advised
<BR>
cosmetic surgery) can be unintentionally amusing, not that I'd ever say
<BR>
so to the people in question.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I like seeing people completely comfortable inside their own skin,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no matter what their &quot;skin&quot; looks like.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm no pinup poster material myself, so it was reassuring to see other
<BR>
middle aged folks there who were just as out of shape as I am :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I like the attitude of the folks there: that a positive outlook
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and good health is more valuable than their percentage of body fat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or lack thereof)
</EM><BR>
<P>See, Spike? You'd be welcome too.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; And it's a good example for kids too- maybe the next generation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Amerians won't have such puritan attitudes about sex and nudity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as many people in my generation (something that Americans can learn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the Europeans, in my opinion)
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed 100%- nudity ought to be boring, not an illicit fascination.
