<P><EM>&gt; Her ideals were as square as you can get. Unhip, uncool, out of it..  very 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  germanic/idealistic/super-uber-stiffo. At a secular humanist meeting an 
</EM><BR>
old 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  guy called her an intellectual bimbo. When it came to modern art, she had 
</EM><BR>
no 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  talent herself, nor an art education. Yet she felt utterly qualified to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  vilify with great passion, the greatest names of the day, simply because 
</EM><BR>
her 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  understandin gof it was limited. She trashed a whole genre simply because 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; she 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  couldn't see the vlaue of it. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Her entire outlook was sneering, venomous, self-important and smug. If 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  instead of spending so much time on self absorbtion she had gone to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  trouble to educate herself on the current artscene, I'd have had more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should I take that as a &quot;no&quot; vote ?.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a bit of an artist myself (i'm not sure which bit) I have always taken 
<BR>
the &quot;...I know what I like&quot; train of thought. IMHO Vangough couldn't paint 
<BR>
for toffee, his pictures belong in  a school corridor somewhere with a label 
<BR>
saying &quot;1st year art class&quot;. On the other hand the work of Picasso amuzes me 
<BR>
greatly and I like it. This is my taste and I don't feel have to defend it. 
<BR>
If someone thinks its worth hanging in a gallery and putting a multimillion 
<BR>
price tag on it, thats fine by me and I respect their taste.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing winds me up more than some jumped up &quot;insert expletive here&quot; who 
<BR>
thinks they have the right to tell me what is and what isn't good art. I have 
<BR>
never read any of Rand's opinions and don't intend to. Like wise my view on 
<BR>
most critics is that can stick them, I have my own mind and my own opinion.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for modern art, I can take it or leave it. I know one thing, I don't 
<BR>
have room for half a picked Cow in my front room.
