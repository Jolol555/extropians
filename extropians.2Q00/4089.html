<P>
So, this interested me enough that I decided to do a little web
<BR>
research.  Not much; I'm no expert.
<BR>
<P>First off, I was struck by the claim that she didn't actually do
<BR>
anything for those likely to survive her treatment.  While I was aware
<BR>
of the fact that she administered to the dying, I was also given to
<BR>
understand that she would feed the hungry, cure the sick, etc.
<BR>
<P>Many of her critics have asserted that her only goal was to give
<BR>
Catholics a good Catholic death...  I've yet to see this clearly
<BR>
stated by her.  Every quote of hers that I find talks about feeding
<BR>
the hungry and &quot;taking care&quot; of the sick.  However, I did see this on a
<BR>
pro-Theresa site:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Mother Teresa founded here [India] the Kalighat Home for the Dying,
<BR>
which she named Nirmal Hriday (meaning &quot;Pure Heart&quot;). She and her
<BR>
fellow nuns gathered dying Indians off the streets of Calcutta and
<BR>
brought them to this home to care for them during the days before they
<BR>
died. ...
<BR>
<P>Ever since then, thousands of men, women and children (more that
<BR>
42,000) have been taken from the streets of Calcutta and transported
<BR>
to Nirmal Hriday. Approximately 19,000 of those have had the
<BR>
opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their
<BR>
last hours they met human and Divine Love, and could feel that they
<BR>
also were children of God. For those who didn't die, the Missionaries
<BR>
of Charity tried to find jobs or they were sent to homes where they
<BR>
could live happily some more years in a caring home.&quot;
<BR>
<P>So, out of the tens of thousands of people treated by her order, about
<BR>
half of those have died.  I'd say that this is pretty hit-and-miss for
<BR>
somebody whose sole purpose is to give people a good Catholic death.
<BR>
<P>Better to say, as another critic of hers, Christopher Hitchens, says:
<BR>
&quot;Very rightly is it said that she tends to the dying, because if you
<BR>
were doing anything but dying she hasn't really got much to offer.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Her order was definitely not geared to provide expert medical help for
<BR>
those who needed it.  It also was obviously not geared to help the
<BR>
poorest in any one location.  When Mother Theresa received donations,
<BR>
they did not go towards improving the quality of care in any of her
<BR>
existing facilities, but instead went towards opening up more
<BR>
facilities.  All of these facilities were thereby far less effective
<BR>
than they otherwise could have been.
<BR>
<P>Of course, some of what you assert (esp. your suggestion that she had
<BR>
Munchausen by Proxy) cannot be defended at all.  In addition, much of
<BR>
your cricicism of her relies on the assumption that Catholicism is
<BR>
wrong.  While I happen to agree with you in this, I don't normally
<BR>
regard people who act upon Catholicism as &quot;evil&quot; unless they start
<BR>
violating people's negative rights.  You may think that supporting the
<BR>
Duvalier family is sufficient, but I don't.
<BR>
<P>Wrong, perhaps, but not evil.
<BR>
