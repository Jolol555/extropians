<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Most of list subscribers probably don't understand the mechanics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the scope of control present in totalitarian states, not having lived
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in one. Why do you think it can never happen here?

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;It could very easily happen here.

<P>There has never in the history of humanity been a nation which allows its 
<BR>
citizens as many freedoms as ours.  There has similarly never been a 
<BR>
government which is as accountable to the populace as ours is.  There has 
<BR>
never before been a nation in which the press has had an absolutely 
<BR>
unfettered right to criticize the government.  There has never before been a 
<BR>
populace which has been as well educated and informed as we are now.  There 
<BR>
has never been a time where the average citizen could reach as wide an 
<BR>
audience as any member of the media or the goverment until now.
<BR>
<P>I mean come on!  In light of the recent thread regarding politeness, I will 
<BR>
guard my words as much as possible.  I am *not* calling anyone here stupid.  
<BR>
But, it seems to me that to believe that America of 2000 a.d. could somehow 
<BR>
suddenly devolve &quot;very easily&quot; into a totalitarian state is..., well..., 
<BR>
um..., way, way, very much less than reasonable?
