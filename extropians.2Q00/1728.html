I did my &quot;preaching&quot; re: post-cryonics reassembly.
<BR>
<P>Then on Thu, 27 Apr 2000 <A HREF="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20CRYONICS:%20Limits%20to%20storage%20[was:%20Where%20to%20look%20for%20the%20answers...]&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.UW2.4.20.0004271846270.6485-100000@www.aeiveos.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</A> wrote:

<P><EM>&gt; ... but I do want to point out that this model makes most sense if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you think of the tissue as being frozen and then cracked apart.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However in fact freezing is a dynamic, possibly chaotic process.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think I would call it &quot;chaotic&quot;.  The question would be whether
<BR>
there are specific molecules (perhaps those that are the most polar) that
<BR>
serve as the nucleation sites for the ice crystals or whether the crystals
<BR>
always start in a region of &quot;pure&quot; water.  I would presume that crystals
<BR>
will start inside and/or outside the cells and not near membrane surfaces.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ice crystals grow and spread through the tissues like spears, providing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signifcant mechanical stresses to cells that are still in the unfrozen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed, but they are either going to puncture the membranes leaving them
<BR>
pretty much intact or else move the membranes as complete units.  Your
<BR>
comment does raise the interesting question of whether intracellular
<BR>
or extracellular ice tends to form first.  Intracellularly, cells are held
<BR>
together by a fairly dense and strong cytoskeleton.  They also have fairly
<BR>
high concentrations of proteins and other molecules that are larger than
<BR>
any ion channels. So, I suspect that intracellular crystals cannot grow
<BR>
very much.  That would leave extracellular crystals as the major source
<BR>
of disruptions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  The chemistry of the intercellular medium changes drastically, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; water freezes and the concentration of larger molecules rises.  The cells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dehydrate as fluids flow through the channels or perhaps even through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tears in the membrane, putting things into a highly unnatural state.
</EM><BR>
<P>I generally agree with this, but the norms for cellular fluid content
<BR>
and protein concentrations should be known, so &quot;resetting&quot; them should
<BR>
not be particularly difficult.  Harder will be the repair of membrane
<BR>
tears, though if the scenario you describe is accurate, as the cells
<BR>
dehydrate they should shrink until there is no remaining water and
<BR>
you have a bag of condensed cytoskeleton, proteins, small molecules
<BR>
and ice crystals.
<BR>
<P>We have to remember that in biology we freeze cells all the time.
<BR>
In most cases this is highly reversible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This whole process occurs before the local tissue actually freezes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [ snip ] But even before things are frozen there will be damage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All of that occurs in the fluid state, and putting things back won't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as easy as assembling a jigsaw puzzle.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  But that is not the same as saying it will be &quot;impossible&quot;.
<BR>
You would have to have widespread dismantling of the fingerprints
<BR>
of where the synapses were located and perhaps the loss of their
<BR>
&quot;qualities&quot; to lose the information you need to recover the brain.
