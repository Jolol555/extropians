<EM>&gt; &gt; I really had no idea that going by a nickname would cause such a ruckuss,

<EM>&gt; &gt; especially on a list populated with people named Max More, Natasha

<EM>&gt; &gt; Vita-More, Spudboy, Tom Morrow, etc.  ...

<P>And I've been the retroman since I first got on the web in 1991, but
<BR>
I've never failed to identify my real identity either, and I've never
<BR>
refused to tell people where I can be contacted by mail, phone and
<BR>
email. I don't hide, but I will refuse to respect individuals who argue
<BR>
for a position they don't have the guts to stand up for and live by.

<EM>&gt; Since Ive been one of the yahoos advocating openness, (at least

<EM>&gt; part of the time) Im obligated to pay up in the info department...

<EM>&gt; Mike I think you were too hard on Zero, tho.  I know that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he did publish his first and last name on the list last time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we went thru this particular memefest, actually I think he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did so at least twice before.   {8-]  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>The last time we went at this, I gave my full name and info as above. He
<BR>
said his first name was Michael, but did not indicate that Powers was
<BR>
his real last name, nor did he, or has he now, matched my openness with
<BR>
a similar level of information. That reluctance to reciprocate indicates
<BR>
that he does not pratice what he preaches. He IS a hypocrite. I am
<BR>
calling him on this. Hypocrisy IS a cardinal sin of the rules of debate.
<BR>
Walk the walk if you are gonna talk the talk.
