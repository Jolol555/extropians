<EM>&gt; I think you have a point here, although I don't think this is the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important difference between art and science. Science is constrained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by reality (or rather, it *seeks* constraints), while art has few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constraints ( mainly some cultural and a few technical constraints)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and actively tries to avoid them.  Engineering is similar to art in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this respect, although it is constrained by a deliberate purpose it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has to achieve.
</EM><BR>
<P>I generally agree here, though I would point out that art is even more
<BR>
limited than that.  After all, if an art object can't objectify -- even in a
<BR>
cultural context -- its message, then it might as well be random.  This does
<BR>
not mean that the message objectified in it has to be easy to get at -- any
<BR>
more than a monograph on quantum field theory has to be easy to understand.
<BR>
<P>I would also ask people here what they think is the purpose of art?  And I
<BR>
don't mean the purpose as it relates to the individual artist, but its
<BR>
purpose for the human mind.  Why do humans seem to be the only animals that
<BR>
produce art?  (Yeah, I've heard of apes painting, but this is inside the
<BR>
context of working with humans.  They don't do that in the wild.  Also,
<BR>
whalesong, birdsong, and the like seem more aimed at communication than
<BR>
contemplation, though the jury might still be out on the former for
<BR>
whalesong.  Humans appear to be the only unequivocal makers of art.)
