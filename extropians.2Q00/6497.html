<EM>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20More%20Green%20Party&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGMEBPFIAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thank Marx every day that I live in Australia, because with my slum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; background I would have been dead and maimed a number of times over if I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had to depend in childhood on my parents' income to cover my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; health.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it's a good thing you were able to get medical care.  The world would
<BR>
now be a less interesting place if you'd died as a child.  But this proves
<BR>
no more in general than my tale of  Wendy in Moscow.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;I have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;friend who got pneumonia when she was in Moscow and had to go into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;hospital there.  &lt;the horror, the horror &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah, yeah. Stalinism isn't anyone's model of a good society.
</EM><BR>
<P>I knew someone would get me for this!  OK, so the history of one fairly
<BR>
unusual country doesn't prove anything.
<BR>
<P>Can we all agree, though, that in general, people are willing to work harder
<BR>
if their material rewards are directly proportional to the work done?  And
<BR>
that they're willing to spend more time, thought, and money on research if
<BR>
they stand a chance of getting a patent if and when they come up with
<BR>
something?  And that, ceteris paribus, a more intelligent worker in the
<BR>
medical field will be more valuable than a less intelligent one?
<BR>
<P>Actually, my point about the quality of medical care under &quot;Green Party&quot;
<BR>
type rule had nothing to do with the cost of medical care to the consumer.
<BR>
It had much more to do with the freedom of people to enter into contracts
<BR>
with each other and the definition of property rights. I accept the
<BR>
responsibility for being misunderstood.  My communications skills are
<BR>
atrocious (but I'm working on them).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I love the way such topics (from a non-US perspective) go instantly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hysterical with fear &amp; loathing. Might do many people on the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to spend some time in other First World nations where we do things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; differently (yet haven't ended up in an immiserated Gulag).
</EM><BR>
<P>Heheh.  Walk a mile in the other guy's moccasins.  No doubt it would be
<BR>
good, but second best would be learn more about what it's like from
<BR>
first-hand accounts of people who live there.  So what IS it like in
<BR>
Australia, Damien?   (and since we're not talking f2f and you can't see the
<BR>
sincerity in my eyes, let me assure you that this question is asked out of
<BR>
real curiosity, not as a rhetorical device).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Damien
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [incredibly irritated by the recent Australian govt introduction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a Goods
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &amp; Services Tax that will almost certainly impact the poor more than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wealthy]
</EM><BR>
<P>Most taxes and regulations DO end up impacting the poor more than the
<BR>
wealthy.  Listen, one reasons I stopped practicing tax law (I confess, it
<BR>
was a minor reason) was that the people who needed help the most couldn't
<BR>
afford my fees (and I couldn't afford to charge really low fees, what with
<BR>
having to keep up the overhead on the office, secretaries, etc.).  I do more
<BR>
good overall offering low-cost tax return preparation and do-it-yourself
<BR>
advice to people about how to deal with the taxing authorities.
