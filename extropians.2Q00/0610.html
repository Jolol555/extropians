Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>What is in these posts is very exciting, in that they give detailed plans on 
<BR>
the timeline and goals of David Pizer, regarding the development of his 
<BR>
resort and cryonics enclave.  He further shares his vision for the place(I 
<BR>
want to eat at the restaurant he envisions, and so would you!) and tells who 
<BR>
will take control after he is suspended.  Perhaps, the Extro in 2005 could 
<BR>
be held there!
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg

To Dave Pizer:
<BR>
<P>snip
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So does this property you've bought lie anywhere close to a FREQUENT &gt;bus 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;line?
</EM><BR>
<P>This area is on the route of what are called &quot;Stage&quot; lines.  These are 12 to 
<BR>
15 passenger vans that make a trip between Phoenix and Prescott and several 
<BR>
stops in between several times a day and there are a couple of different 
<BR>
companies doing this.
<BR>
<P>For us to have them stop every day we would have to establish that we
<BR>
almost always had 1 or more passengers per day.  We won't have this at
<BR>
first. So at the early part of this we would not be on their regular line as 
<BR>
a regular stop. But you still could get service by merely calling ahead.  If 
<BR>
you wanted to go to Phoenix or Prescott you would probably have to call in 
<BR>
several hours before the stage left towards our area from its starting 
<BR>
point.  On the trip back I think all you would have to do is be at the pick 
<BR>
up place in Phoenix.
<BR>
<P>They have several places they pick up at in Phoenix. Most *large* retirement 
<BR>
communities in Arizona have their own vans that take the residents where 
<BR>
ever they want to go.  So after we get large enough we should have the same. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the first years, you will have to
<BR>
rely on the stage companies which are like mini bus lines.

Subject: Heaven at last&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;To: Dave Pizer
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For centuries theologians have serched for heaven. It appears Dave &gt;Pizer 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has found it at last and just an hour away from Phoenix.
</EM><BR>
<P>Does this sound like heaven? Summer days long and warm with friendly cool 
<BR>
evenings.  Advancing giant white soon-to-be-rain-clouds with dark silver 
<BR>
borders against a purple sky.  Then, the sweet scent of the desert plants 
<BR>
after a cool summer rain.
<BR>
<P>If you get tired of looking at sturdy clumps of oaks and wild flowers along 
<BR>
the stream bank; or tired of watching the animals come to the stream for a 
<BR>
drink: desert chipmunks, bunnys, foxes, white tailed deer, antelope, 
<BR>
squirrels, humming birds in every color, the glimpse of an owl, and brightly 
<BR>
colored butterflies among the wildflowers, if you ever tire of this, then in 
<BR>
a half hour's drive you can be inside the largest Ponderosa Pine Forrest in 
<BR>
the world.  Giant trees with cinnamon colored bark towering 150 feet into 
<BR>
the sky.
<BR>
<P>Pardon me for dwelling on the beauty of this place but it really is a 
<BR>
magnificent setting with the creek and multi-colored rock out-croppings and 
<BR>
all.  And yet it borders the state highway.
<BR>
<P>Another kind of beauty should be built into the facility. The beauty of 
<BR>
safety.  I would like to see those members who want it to be able to wear 
<BR>
some type of device that would monitor their vital signs and if they got 
<BR>
into trouble 24 hours a day, the device would signal the headquarters to 
<BR>
send help.   I don't know how to do this, does anyone out there?  Is the 
<BR>
technology available yet or soon?
<BR>
<P>I would also like to see a basic washout facility available to memebers of 
<BR>
any cryonics society.  So if a resident went down unexpectly, they could be 
<BR>
washed out in a matter of minutes and waiting for their cryonics company to 
<BR>
do a perfusion.  This will involve a good repore with the coroner's office 
<BR>
and perhaps some legal work.  Arizona has laws that are favorable to 
<BR>
cryonics and we need to see how to use them best for our members.
<BR>
<P>One project I would like to see worked on is where a cryonics patients had 
<BR>
the legal right not to be subject to an autopsy.  This might be something to 
<BR>
work on in the future after we have more voting members in that county.  I 
<BR>
would like to see people with EMT certificates living there also.

<P><EM>&gt;&quot;Excuse me.  Could you tell me how to get to Platt Blvd?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>A place to recognize our heros - why not?
<BR>
<P>One of the things that Mike Perry wants to see, and I think the Venturist

Board will support this after we have the other necessities in place, is a

life-extension/cryonics museum.  This would be a nice place to display 
<BR>
various items and remember people who have helped the movement along.
<BR>
<P>Mike wants to see a book publishing plant and a few other things first.  I 
<BR>
want to see us putting out a very nice life extension magazine and doing 
<BR>
more work on the internet.  All in good time.

<EM>&gt;Subject: the timeframe for developing the resort and cryonics community
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Date: Sun, 09 Apr 2000 16:31:49 PDT&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;David,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I just wondered what the time frame is going to be for the full &gt;completion 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the resort and cryonics community?  I realize it may &gt;not be really 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possible to say.  Perhaps, one year for the initial &gt;stage of building the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resort and perhaps five to ten for the full &gt;completion of the resort and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cryonics community?  How many stages of &gt;development at this point do you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see, and over how long a period?  &gt;And if not confidential, what level of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;costs will this entail?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't mind discussing the financial aspects.
<BR>
The land is paid for.  I see, perhaps, 3 stages of construction?
<BR>
<P>FIRST STAGE COMPLETED IN 18 MONTHS IF ALL GOES WELL
<BR>
<P>The initial resort will be 10 small cabins along the creek and one lodge 
<BR>
building where the manager will live and the dining facilities (at first 
<BR>
just for people staying at the resort) will be.  This will be enough to 
<BR>
generate profit above expenses.
<BR>
<P>I have owned 2 other similar resorts (but not near as beautiful) and know 
<BR>
where the break even points should be.  This is a new type venture for this 
<BR>
area.  Mayer has not had the upscale resorts like Sedona.  I think there is 
<BR>
a need and the setting along the creek rivals Sedona in a smaller way.  So 
<BR>
there will be some new things to learn, but 10 cabins will generate profit 
<BR>
above all expenses if there is no debt and there is not.
<BR>
<P>This first stage construction will cost between $500,000 and $800,000
<BR>
depending on the site costs and what type of buildings we build.  For the 
<BR>
resort we are leaning towards SanteFe with natural log porches.  The cabins 
<BR>
would be Sante Fe with slight log treatments (like shaved pine porch poles 
<BR>
and overhead beams) inside as well as outside.
<BR>
<P>The reason the cost varies so much is because I don't know what the site 
<BR>
costs (sewer, roads, water well, underground pipes and utility lines) will 
<BR>
be.  We may have to design and build (in the initial stage) an expensive 
<BR>
sewer plant capable to handle many more cabins and homes to be built in the 
<BR>
future.  The larger sewer plant would eliminate having several smaller 
<BR>
septic treatment plants built at each stage of enlargement.  Since there is 
<BR>
a creek running through the property the standards for the sewer plant will 
<BR>
be higher.
<BR>
<P>My guess is that we can get the first stage up and in operation for
<BR>
$600,000 if all goes well.
<BR>
<P>We are now negotiating with officials for zoning approval and with an
<BR>
engineer on a site plan.  That site plan also deals with issues of zoning 
<BR>
and access to and from the state highway.
<BR>
<P>I hope to have a chunk of money  (enough to pay for this first stage of 
<BR>
construction) in hand (from sale of another property) within 12 months from 
<BR>
now - or sooner, and by that time have the engineering, site plan and zoning 
<BR>
approved.  (I have the money to pay for the site plan and the expenses of 
<BR>
the zoning approval while we are waiting for the other parcel to close).  So 
<BR>
if all goes well, in 12 months we have all approvals and the site plan in 
<BR>
hand and the money comes in at about the same time.
<BR>
<P>Another 6 months after that and we should have stage 1 completed.  Do you 
<BR>
want to make a reservation now :=)
<BR>
<P>STAGE TWO COMPLETED ABOUT 3 YEARS FROM NOW + -
<BR>
<P>The second stage will be to enlarge the resort.  After a year or two of 
<BR>
operation with just 10 cabins, we will know what things to offer in the 
<BR>
second generation cabins and what is not needed.  Are there requests for 
<BR>
larger cabins?  Leave out the hot tubs and Fireplaces - and have lower 
<BR>
rates?
<BR>
<P>Do we need to offer horseback riding?  Jeep tours (very popular in nearby 
<BR>
Sedona)?  How about gold panning?  Do we use thicker carpet and more 
<BR>
expensive furniture and charge a higer rate - or is a less expensive cabin 
<BR>
what the trade wants?
<BR>
<P>The second stage will also include a larger place to dine, perhaps food to 
<BR>
the public (people who are and are not staying at the resort), do we offer 
<BR>
beer and wine?  Some guests will like that, some guests will quit staying if 
<BR>
we do - which way does the best on the bottom line?
<BR>
<P>The first stage dining will be in the lodge sort of a bed and breakfast, 
<BR>
lunch and dinner facility.  Later we would like to have a public restaurant 
<BR>
with dining right on the creek.  There used to be a place like this in 
<BR>
Sedona, and it was the most popular place in town until it burned down.  At 
<BR>
night they had dinner served along the creek with special lights that 
<BR>
lighted up the creek in a special way.  They put out feed and salt so the 
<BR>
animals would come to the creek and the customers just loved it.
<BR>
<P>Breakfast along the creek as sunrise was a special event.
<BR>
<P>The second stage will include addition to the lodge and another 10 or 15 
<BR>
cabins.  The income from that will come from the sale of other property that 
<BR>
I have but have not offered for sale yet.  I suspect the second stage will 
<BR>
be able to be constructed faster say 6 months from planning to finish.  That 
<BR>
is because the site plan will not have to be all new, just modified and the 
<BR>
zoning will not be an issue.
<BR>
<P>THE GOOD PART  =  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THE CRYONICS COMMUNITY IN 
<BR>
PLACE WITHIN 4 TO 5 YEARS FROM TODAY.
<BR>
<P>The third stage will be the building more for the use of the cryonics
<BR>
community.  Free-standing houses and more moderate apartments.  Spa.  Pool? 
<BR>
Exercise room.  Meeting rooms (which can also generate income from 
<BR>
non-cryonics companies that want to hold seminars for their executives 
<BR>
etc.).   Offices for cryonics workers to post our message on the internet 
<BR>
and host other events.  Do radio talk-shows and perhaps send members to do 
<BR>
tv talk shows.  A printing company to produce a magazine and books.
<BR>
<P>By this time we will have a feel for what type of annual net income the 
<BR>
resort facility generates and  I will have four separate ways (or 
<BR>
combinations) to raise the last needed money for the third stage of 
<BR>
construction:  Sale of additional personal assets (which I will do if I then 
<BR>
choose to move there on a permanent basis; borrow on the resort; raise money 
<BR>
from the cryonics community in the form of investment or donations; or use 
<BR>
annual profits from the resort without borrowing (that would probably only 
<BR>
allow $200,000 to $400,000 a year for new construction - I want to go faster 
<BR>
than that).
<BR>
<P>I am also open to other suggestions.
<BR>
<P>I will control the resort until I go into the tank.  The Board of Directors 
<BR>
for the Society for Venturism will control the cyronics community.
<BR>
<P>After such a time that everything is paid for, the cryonics community can 
<BR>
use some of the resort profits (and whatever other money we can generate) to 
<BR>
do charitable work: help underfunded people get suspended; enlighten the 
<BR>
world not to die.
<BR>
<P>All along during the construction from phase 1 on, the people in cryonics 
<BR>
can use the resort (before the cryonics community is built) for seminars, 
<BR>
meetings, generating publicity whatever helps.  All ideas are appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the interest.  If you have any other questions I will be glad to 
<BR>
answer them.
<BR>
<P>Dave Pizer
