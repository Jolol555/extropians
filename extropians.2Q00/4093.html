&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit I never expected to see anyone trash Mother Teresa.  
<BR>
Who's next Gandhi?  MLK?  Your right about one thing and that is that 
<BR>
speaking poorly of Mother Teresa does carry a stigmatism with it.  It's will 
<BR>
usually get you the same reaction as saying the Holocaust never existed.  At 
<BR>
first I thought you must be speaking tongue in cheek but as I read on I found 
<BR>
that you were being quite serious and of course I found this quite 
<BR>
discouraging.  I feel privileged to have lived in a time when she did live 
<BR>
and gave so freely of herself because if I did not I would think that she 
<BR>
were someone that people had made up as a modern day myth or legend.  Her 
<BR>
example has made me demand much more of myself and my life and what I do with 
<BR>
it.  It's people like her that make me stop what I'm doing and take a good 
<BR>
look a my value system and think about what I'm doing with my life.  I'm not 
<BR>
attacking you about your opinion I just don't get it.  The woman took what 
<BR>
she knew and did the best she could with it.  Not too many people could leave 
<BR>
the sort of impact that she left in the world, not in a positive way.
