<EM>&gt; I could say yes but you probably get cancer lots of times and never even

<EM>&gt; know it

<P>This is a good point John.  The individual who won the Infinity Prize
<BR>
at the A4M conference for the development of angiogenesis inhibitors,
<BR>
had some slides showing the difference in size between leasions before
<BR>
and after they turned on the genes promoting angiogenesis.  I believe he
<BR>
commented that many tumor specialists believe that the elderly have many
<BR>
microscopic proto-tumors that simply have not figured out how to turn on
<BR>
the angiogenesis genes that allow them to grow to observable sizes.
<BR>
But these are in indivuals 50 or more years old who obviously have
<BR>
many kg of tissue that could potentially cause problems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; because your immune system kills the tumor when it's still microscopic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A lab dish doesn't have much of an immune system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Another good point.  The recent work showing that you can &quot;prime&quot;
<BR>
dendritic cells to display tumor proteins to the induce the
<BR>
immune system into attacking a tumor clearly shows that the
<BR>
immune system *can* recognize it as foreign and deal with it.
<BR>
The problems that can occur are (a) the mutations may be in
<BR>
protein sequences that are not displayed by an individual's
<BR>
MHC sequences; and (b) the tumor cells can respond by activating
<BR>
a program that induces apoptosis in the immune system cells
<BR>
(a cancer cell counter-attack).
<BR>
<P>There has been very little work done (to my knowledge) on
<BR>
how frequently your immune system removes proto-tumors
<BR>
because it is very difficult to observe micro-scale
<BR>
cytocide that leaves behind few if any traces.  The fact
<BR>
that there are vaccines against some forms of cancer on
<BR>
the horizon would argue that the immune system can be
<BR>
trained to do it, so it is likely to be occuring at least
<BR>
in some individuals as a natural defense.
<BR>
<P>What you would like to do in the long run is develop cell lines
<BR>
for tissues that &quot;must&quot; divide, that are highly effective at
<BR>
displaying any mutations in the genes responsible for the
<BR>
regulation of cell replication, then train the immune system
<BR>
to be highly effective at recognizing cells displaying those
<BR>
mutations.  You then replace your normal tissues with those
<BR>
engineered to wave red flags in front of your immune system
<BR>
when they begin to run amok.
<BR>
<P>Good discussion.
