<P>They will test it all-up, after they have acheived a calculated system

<P>This sounds too much like a physics teacher arguing that heavier-than-

air flight is impossible as the Wright Flier passes overhead.  Without
<BR>
missing a beat, he observes &quot;No stewardesses, no in-flight movie,
<BR>
hell, we dont even have AIRPORTS!  This will never go anywhere.&quot;
<BR>
Lets give it a chance, shall we John?
<BR>
<P>You know, tho, this whole thing puts me in a dilemma of sorts.
<BR>
The whole issue is that the pentagon wants to buy something
<BR>
that they cannot talk about and cannot reveal how well it works.
<BR>
As an information freedom advocate, you can see where I am
<BR>
in a tight spot.  {8-]  This is the nature of warfare, and this is
<BR>
why war must be stopped.  It is wasteful beyond imagination,
<BR>
unspeakably tragically wasteful.  It must be stopped.  For the
<BR>
first time in history, we may be able to do just that.  spike

<P>Heres a coupla stories that came over the news wire today that
<BR>
pretty nicely sum up our debate:
<BR>
<P>SCIENTISTS TO TELL CONGRESS CLINTON MISSILE
<BR>
DEFENSE PLAN IS FAULTY: An array of scientists will tell
<BR>
Congress Monday that the Clinton administration's proposed antimissile
<BR>
shield is flawed and should be shelved until the Pentagon can prove
<BR>
it works. Organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists, about 40
<BR>
physicists and engineers will join a growing number of experts who
<BR>
say the $60 billion defense system is incapable of defending
<BR>
the U.S. from even a limited missile attack by countries such as North Korea
<BR>
or Iran. &quot;What's on the books at this point is simply not adequate, and
<BR>
never will be,&quot; said Lawrence Jones, a physicist at the University of
<BR>
Michigan in Ann Arbor. Critics say the Pentagon has intentionally
<BR>
simplified tests to disguise the system's inability to tell an incoming
<BR>
warhead from a decoy. Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, spokesman for
<BR>
the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, said the critics lack the
<BR>
information needed to understand the system. (Wall Street Journal)
<BR>
<P>COCHRAN REBUTS SCIENTIST's CLAIMS ON NMD
<BR>
PERFORMANCE: Sen. Thad Cochran on Friday criticized
<BR>
reports from a Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist that the
<BR>
national missile defense (NMD) systems now being tested could be
<BR>
easily defeated by simple coutermeasures. Ted Postol, an MIT scientist
<BR>
and one of the leading critics of the Pentagon's missile defense program
<BR>
and Raytheon's Patriot missile's performance in the Gulf War, also
<BR>
recently alleged that the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization
<BR>
(BMDO) altered the NMD flight test program to cover up problems.
<BR>
Cochran, who chairs the Senate subcommittee on international security
<BR>
and proliferation, took on Postol on several accounts in a Senate floor
<BR>
speech. For example, Cochran said that Postol said he found the fatal
<BR>
weakness in the BMD system after studying BMDO data from the NMD
<BR>
Flight Test 1A conducted in June 1997. But, Cochran said, Postol never
<BR>
mentioned that test was not intended as a warhead intercept test or that
<BR>
the kill vehicle now being used for the program is built by a different
<BR>
contractor. And, Postol also claimed to have discovered in the data
<BR>
from Flight Test 1A that the vehicle will be defeated by the simplest of
<BR>
balloon decoys, Cochran noted. &quot;The fact is that in Flight Test-3, on Oct.
<BR>
2, 1999, exactly the opposite happened, when the EKV disregarded a
<BR>
balloon decoy and successfully destroyed its target&quot; Cochran said.
<BR>
Cochran also said Postol made similar disparaging remarks in the past,
<BR>
all of which were proven false, about Lockheed Martin's
<BR>
Theater High Altitude Area Defense system and Patriot. (Defense Daily)
