Ripped from sci.physics.relativity 5/27/00
<BR>
<P>&quot;Sure it exists, island--- we are talking about it! :-)
<BR>
<P>You (or were you just quoting someone else?) meant to say that the
<BR>
principle of relativity is (presumably) an idealization.
<BR>
<P>In particular, those on the trail of the elusive quantum theory of gravity
<BR>
mostly now agree that &quot;time&quot; is an illusion arising in the classical
<BR>
approximation, and that on sufficiently small scales, &quot;spacetime&quot; begins
<BR>
to look like a multiply connected &quot;foam&quot;, and on still smaller scales,
<BR>
consists of discrete (quantized) area elements having a purely
<BR>
combinatorial relationship to one another.  In the elegant &quot;spin foam&quot;
<BR>
approach, spacetimes are objects in a category whose objects are arrows
<BR>
&quot;transforming&quot; something like a Feynman diagram into a new diagram.  The
<BR>
great thing about this is that one can hope to make Feynman's notion of a
<BR>
path integral rigorous, by passing from integrals over enormous spaces of
<BR>
paths to sums over combinatorial relationships.  Much remains to be done
<BR>
to even lay the mathematical foundations for this approach to quantum
<BR>
gravity, but this approach does have the attractive feature that it is
<BR>
sufficiently general that it should apply to all other approaches.  Thus,
<BR>
it is more likely than anything else which people are working on right now
<BR>
to play a role in the ultimate theory (perhaps much modified, probably in
<BR>
the direction of still greater mathematical sophistication, which
<BR>
ultimately means simplification).
<BR>
<P>At any rate, the point is that &quot;everyone knows&quot; that Lorentz covariance
<BR>
may turn out to be merely an illusion which arises in the classical
<BR>
approximation.  The details of how this happen must explain why the
<BR>
standard model of particle physics (which is set up in the &quot;arena&quot; of the
<BR>
Minkowski vacuum) works so well, and why gtr works so well, in order for
<BR>
the quantum theory of gravity (and everything else) to be acceptable.  To
<BR>
a surprising degree, it is already well understood how this should happen,
<BR>
at least in the context of well understood &quot;toy models&quot; which are
<BR>
presumably similar in some respects to the full quantum theory of gravity.
