Wired news reports this morning about a conference at NIH on &quot;Nanoscience
<BR>
and Nanotechnology: Shaping Biomedical Research&quot;.  The first substantive
<BR>
talk, &quot;What is Nanotechnology?&quot;, was by Steven Block, who wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Against the backdrop of much exciting technical and scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development, there are legitimate expectations for breakthroughs in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; areas such as computing/electronics, biotechnology, materials, and so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on. In many cases, these expectations seem realistic and appropriate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and therefore merit the attention and support of government agencies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; academia, and the private sector.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In others cases, the expectations seem naïve and unrealistic: these are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; primarily being advanced by a vocal cult of futurists whose enthusiasm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is beyond question, but whose agenda is not. I will argue that for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real science to proceed, nanotechnologists ought to distance themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the giggle factor and position themselves for the serious work of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 21st century.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Wired article makes it clear that it is Drexler and his associates
<BR>
whom Block is criticizing here.  As nanotech goes mainstream I suspect
<BR>
that we will see more of this kind of distancing.
<BR>
<P>Another point made by Block, echoed in the title of the conference,
<BR>
is that there is real science still to be done at the nanoscale.
<BR>
This contradicts the often-heard claim of nanotech advocates that all the
<BR>
basic science has been done, and all that is needed is straightforward
<BR>
engineering work to put the pieces together.
