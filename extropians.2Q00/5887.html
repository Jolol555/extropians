After reading Max's post under this subject line I went back and read the
<BR>
majority of the posts on this subject posted in the past few weeks.  Even
<BR>
after being on this list for four years I am consistently surprised and
<BR>
appalled that this kind of so-called thinking still goes on in the minds of
<BR>
some alledgedly intelligent transhumanists.
<BR>
<P>As with the &quot;cult&quot; discussion a couple of years ago, there is absolutely no
<BR>
Extropian affinity with any politic or non-transhumanist groups.  There is
<BR>
absolutely no literature on the entire web which indicates otherwise.  The
<BR>
founder of Extropy himself has frequently had to say this publicly due to
<BR>
the militant inanity of a few arrogant individuals.
<BR>
<P>When I read drivel such as the ZOG and Commie Nonsense threads, I am
<BR>
baffled as to the reasons why people make such boorish claims.  Is it
<BR>
insecurity?  The need to attempt to push a philosophy down in order to feel
<BR>
an intellectual betterment?  And why slander?  If, for some unimaginable
<BR>
reason, I was to have a falling out with the Extropy Institute, the last
<BR>
thing I would do would be to slander it on its public forum.  Not only is
<BR>
it untrue and misleading, it is also extremely rude...particularly coming
<BR>
from people who have previously asserted their alleged intellects politely
<BR>
on much more pertinent issues.
<BR>
<P>To those few who I am mainly addressing, all I request (and this is just
<BR>
me, not necessarily anyone else) is that you either post to this forum with
<BR>
good manners and intellectual integrity on issues that have some relevance
<BR>
to transhumanism, or you politely and quietly leave this forum to those who
<BR>
value it, and those who may come to value it.  Is there really any rational
<BR>
alternative otherwise?
