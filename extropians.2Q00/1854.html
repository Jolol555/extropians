<P>
This appears to be a Reuters news release for May 14th!
<BR>
<P>I pasted this in case the link gets pulled:
<BR>

<BR>
<P>The Fed meets on *Teusday, May 16th*. Is PPI released on Friday, May 12th?
<BR>
What is/was the &quot;benign data earlier in the week&quot;- presumably the week of May
<BR>
8-12?
<BR>
<P>============

<BR>
<P>UK Stocks Outlook-Market braces for U.S. rate vote
<BR>
<P>By David Holmes
<BR>
<P>LONDON, May 14 (Reuters) - It was ever thus.
<BR>
<P>Events in the U.S. are likely to be a key focus for the British stock market
<BR>
next week, amid worries that an interest rate increase in
<BR>
the world's biggest economy could derail the bull market on both sides of the
<BR>
Atlantic.
<BR>
<P>On Tuesday, a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest-rate committee
<BR>
could vote to tighten credit -- a decision that would sent tremors through
<BR>
shares on
<BR>
Wall Street and around the world.
<BR>
<P>Even a warning that the Fed was moving towards a tightening bias could have a
<BR>
significant impact, putting investors on guard for a rate hike increasingly
<BR>
likely to
<BR>
come later this year.
<BR>
<P>``From time to time, events on Wall Street become of critical concern, and this
<BR>
is one of those times,'' said Richard Jeffrey, chief economist and investment
<BR>
strategist
<BR>
at investment bank CCF Charterhouse.
<BR>
<P>For London, Tuesday's Fed meeting comes at a sensitive time.
<BR>
<P>Echoing a rise on Wall Street, the leading FTSE 100 index surged to a succession
<BR>
of record peaks in the early months of the year -- leaving the market
<BR>
potentially
<BR>
vulnerable to bad news, if optimistic assumptions on inflation and lending rates
<BR>
prove mistaken.
<BR>
<P>Granted, worries of a possible U.S. rate increase have circulated for some time,
<BR>
as indications continued of strong growth in the American economy.
<BR>
<P>Yet Friday's stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data brought those fears
<BR>
sharply to the fore, contradicting benign data earlier in the week and
<BR>
heightening the
<BR>
prospect that Tuesday's Fed meeting will have to consider a rate move.
<BR>
<P>Any increase could lead to worries that it could be the first of several,
<BR>
undercutting the favourable conditions of easy credit that have proved so stock
<BR>
market positive
<BR>
in recent months.
<BR>
<P>Closer to home, a spate of domestic economic indicators were also due next week,
<BR>
including retail prices and retail sales for April. Companies reporting
<BR>
including
<BR>
retailer Marks &amp; Spencer (quote from Yahoo! UK &amp; Ireland: MKS.L), British
<BR>
Telecommunications (quote from Yahoo! UK &amp; Ireland: BT.L) and brewing-to-leisure
<BR>
group
<BR>
Bass (quote from Yahoo! UK &amp; Ireland: BASS.L).
<BR>
<P>Yet the domestic figures were unlikely to be surprising enough to take the
<BR>
spotlight away from the U.S., where the benchmark Dow index has sped 1,000
<BR>
points
<BR>
beyond the 10,000 mark in the month since that closely-watched barrier was first
<BR>
breached.
<BR>
<P>To be sure, a U.S. rate rise could be taken calmly, if markets reason the Fed
<BR>
was actively pre-emptively to head off inflation pressures later this year.
<BR>
<P>Yet even before Friday's strong U.S. inflation figures, the record-breaking run
<BR>
enjoyed by the FTSE 100 in the early months of the year seemed to have run into
<BR>
the
<BR>
sand.
<BR>
<P>Since the end of March, the leading FTSE 100 index has spiked to a record high
<BR>
of 6,663.8, but has mostly traded in a range broadly between 6,300 and 6,600 in
<BR>
that time.
<BR>
<P>Analysts on Friday warned it was hard to see what fresh positive events would
<BR>
have the power to move the UK market on to fresh highs, with the FTSE 100
<BR>
looking
<BR>
expensive on a near-record high multiple of around 28 times earnings.
<BR>
<P>Investors seeking the outperforming sectors of the rest of the year have
<BR>
increasingly looked to low-rated stocks, in neglected areas of the market, that
<BR>
may be
<BR>
relatively insulated even if there is a rout on Wall Street.
<BR>
<P>However such sectors have a relatively limited impact on the direction of the
<BR>
FTSE 100 index, which is heavily weighted towards the big sectors such as banks,
<BR>
drugs and telecoms whose valuation is highly geared to transAtlantic trends.
<BR>
<P>Betting on the direction of such stocks therefore depends crucially on how Wall
<BR>
Street reacts to the Fed's decision next week.
<BR>
<P>``The U.S. equity market has taken a bet that fast growth will not lead to
<BR>
higher inflation,'' said Jeffrey. ``In all probablity it is a wager that will be
<BR>
lost.''
