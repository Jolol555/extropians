<P>
Hi, all.
<BR>
<P>I would like to add my voice to those expressing sorrow at Sasha's passing.
<BR>
He was a beloved friend for many years, and I have always cherished the time
<BR>
we spent together. I felt a tremendous regret when I discovered that his
<BR>
cryonics arrangements had not been completed, and some guilt, for I know we
<BR>
discussed this the last time we were together.
<BR>
<P>My thoughts are filled with him at this time, and I'm finding it hard to
<BR>
work. Sasha was to be here next week, and I'm very sad that this
<BR>
much-anticipated visit will never occur. For now, I can only hope to
<BR>
continue the work he began.
<BR>
<P>Sasha was to attend the Foresight Gathering next week, and several of his
<BR>
articles have already been incorporated into the program. These will remain,
<BR>
and I will probably find ways to add more. I hope that this will provide a
<BR>
productive expression for the grief I now feel.
<BR>
<P>Further, I would also like to offer my past expertise as a resource for
<BR>
those who wish to discuss cryonics in pursuing their own arrangements.
<BR>
<P>I'll start by replying to the following questions:
<BR>
from Rob Sweeney:
<BR>
<EM> &gt;Do stats exist on the response time between an accident, say, and actually
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;getting frozen?  (forgive my ignorance - but does it just not work this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;way either, that is, does one have to &gt;go&lt; to a facility pre-need, as it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;were).
</EM><BR>
<P>The nature of cryonics is that the procedure cannot begin until the
<BR>
pronouncement of death has occurred. Certain complications fall as the
<BR>
result of this requirement, and they impact our ability to predict an
<BR>
emergency response.
<BR>
<P>In all cases, legal documentation must have been executed *in advance*
<BR>
authorizing an anatomical donation. This is the mechanism whereby Alcor (and
<BR>
the other organizations) can accept custody of a patient.
<BR>
<P>Assuming documentation and funding exists, the emergency response time will
<BR>
depend on when the cryonics organization receives the news of a member's
<BR>
distress. With sufficient notice, a team is deployed to be on hand at the
<BR>
moment of legal death. They are then able to implement the first stages of
<BR>
the cryonics protocol almost immediately.
<BR>
<P>In cases of sudden death, there is often an autopsy, which delays everything
<BR>
a great deal.
<BR>
<P>I have participated in cases where we were holding the patient's hand when
<BR>
death occurred, and the procedure began immediately. There have also been
<BR>
cases where I travelled long distances to wrest a patient's brain from the
<BR>
local coroner. Maybe a third of the cases allowed for advance prep time.
<BR>
<P>But sudden death may not always mean long delays. I'm remembering here, our
<BR>
friend Paul Genteman. He died shortly after intestinal surgery, much to our
<BR>
shock. I was on my way to visit him in the hospital when the call came in to
<BR>
Alcor. Paul's suspension went well, mostly because he was in a Phoenix
<BR>
hospital. We had good relations with the local medical examiners, and this
<BR>
allowed Paul's near-immediate release and application of the suspension
<BR>
protocol.
<BR>
<P>I haven't worked the numbers to establish how many cases had what time
<BR>
frames, but I have certainly identified variables that impact the times to
<BR>
suspension:
<BR>
<P>1. Be signed up.
<BR>
2. Keep your cryonics organization notified of surgeries and illnesses.
<BR>
3. Make certain your family and friends know of your intentions.
<BR>
4. Call Alcor.
<BR>
<P>from Harvey Newstrom
<BR>
<EM> &gt;I would be very interested in how often cryonics arrangements actually
</EM><BR>
work.
<BR>
<P>Cryonics arrangements will work as long as there are remains. Alcor is
<BR>
committed to caring for even the smallest of samples. But the real question
<BR>
here, I think, is how often is the original personality actually preserved.
<BR>
I don't have the answer to this. Our current methods are crude, and there is
<BR>
the damage of death and the damage of freezing. There will also eventually
<BR>
be the damage of thawing and reanimation. Techniques will certainly continue
<BR>
to improve, as our understanding grows.
<BR>
<P>I would like to think that what we have done was enough, but in my heart, I
<BR>
know there is no way to know for certain until we can nearly wake these
<BR>
frozen friends.
<BR>
<P>For Sasha, it is too late, and I will mourn for a long time to come.
<BR>
<P>--Tanya Jones
