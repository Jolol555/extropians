<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm a willing capitalist now.  But there are many in our society who don't

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; have my luck and/or ability.  Some of them live at a level of subsistence

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; which IMO is beneath that fit for a human.  That saddens me.  I believe that

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; someday we'll be able to do better.  That's *all* I was saying.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Such people are the way they are because they buy the lie that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; deserve more than what they've got, that they should not have to work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for it. It saddens me that purportedly intelligent people like you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; continue to give such failed ideas credence, which condemns generations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of millions of people to lives of squalor, hate, resentment, and failure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because they are programmed to beleive the lie you give credence to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That reeks, of a world in which resources are greatly limited and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poplulation are all forced to work a meagre living from what there is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is not the world we live in. In the world we live in, that simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reeks of greed and lack of consideration.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bull. a) resources are only as limited as the inefficiencies of
<BR>
socialist governments make them. b) current production efficiency and
<BR>
capacity here in the US are such that every person could live quite a
<BR>
nice life. As it is, only about a third of the population or so actually
<BR>
works. c) food production, with spoilage, would provide a 3500 calorie
<BR>
diet to every person on earth if the socialist governments got out of
<BR>
the way and let their people acheive. NOTE: starvation only happens in
<BR>
socialist and econimically authoritarian countries.
<BR>
<P>Demanding that a small minority do all the productive work, confiscating
<BR>
half their production as 'taxes', so a majority can live in sloth is
<BR>
what is really greedy and inconsiderate. Its modern slavery.
