<P>&lt;&lt; Why are you quoting the prez, like we care about his opinion?  A better 
<BR>
analogy
<BR>
&nbsp;would be, we punish hijackers, but we still have airline flights!  The goal 
<BR>
of
<BR>
&nbsp;the anti gun movement is nothing less than to take away guns from honest 
<BR>
people.
<BR>
&nbsp;Why do you come in here and make obviously misleading statements as if we all
<BR>
&nbsp;have noodles for brains? &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, may I also ask; does your President, Governor, &amp; City Mayor not to 
<BR>
mention countless other public figures, have guns to protect him at home and 
<BR>
when he goes outside also?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer is yes, then thank you we will keep ours also.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we have had many innocent people shot down by the lowlife of the 
<BR>
world; did that lowlife ever once refuse to kill because their victums were 
<BR>
not armed?  Can you tell me of all the times the police were Johny on the 
<BR>
spot to defend those victums?
