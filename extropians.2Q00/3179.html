<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Note that evidence suggests that SSRIs can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase the chance of suicide. A leading theory
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as to why is that while an antidepressant effect
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can take up to 3 weeks to kick in, CNS stimulating
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adverse reactions can occur even on the first dose,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is why a sedative may be given with an SSRI.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ADRs, such as agitation and hyperactivity,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typically fit into the diagnostic profile of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;condition akathisia. The result is a state of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agitated depression wherein the likelihood that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one would act on suicidal impulses is increased.

<BR>
<P>Five different mechanisms have been proposed whereby
<BR>
antidepressant treatment might lead to suicide: first
<BR>
by simply ameliorating depressions more rapidly; second
<BR>
by an action intrinsic to the specific antidepressant
<BR>
effects; third by toxicity in overdose; fourth by side-
<BR>
effects of specific antidepressants; and finally by
<BR>
virtue of treatment inefficacy. Evidence from randomized
<BR>
control trials (RCT), controlled case studies and
<BR>
epidemiological studies on this question is reviewed
<BR>
and it is concluded that antidepressants can be
<BR>
implicated in some cases of suicide during treatment.
<BR>
Modifications of clinical trial methods and
<BR>
pharmacogenetic studies would yield a richer data
<BR>
set to explore this issue further.

<BR>
<P>Only 5% of suicidal patients on the average use their
<BR>
prescribed antidepressant to commit suicide. Underprescription
<BR>
of antidepressants and failure of antidepressant therapy appear
<BR>
to be of greater practical importance than the toxicity of
<BR>
individual compounds. Prescribing less toxic agents, therefore,
<BR>
will not be of great advantage, especially if they are less
<BR>
efficacious. Several antidepressants including the selective
<BR>
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may increase suicidal
<BR>
behavior by energizing depressed patients to act along
<BR>
preexisting suicidal thoughts or by inducing akathisia with
<BR>
associated self-destructive impulses. For acutely suicidal
<BR>
patients, the use of more sedating antidepressants is
<BR>
recommended. Clinical trials could not confirm a superiority
<BR>
of SSRIs over tricyclics in reducing the number of suicide
<BR>
attempts. There is evidence from large international data
<BR>
sources and a large multicenter controlled trial that lithium
<BR>
prophylaxis decreases the suicide risk and overall mortality
<BR>
in affective disorders. A suicide-preventing effect has not
<BR>
been demonstrated conclusively for antidepressants or
<BR>
non-lithium mood stabilizers.

<BR>
<P>Several cases of suicidal thinking or suicidal behavior during
<BR>
fluoxetine treatment are described in the literature. Akathisia
<BR>
or dysphoric extrapyramidal reactions may explain the emergence
<BR>
of suicidal ideation during fluoxetine treatment. Retrospective
<BR>
and controlled studies found no relationship between fluoxetine
<BR>
and the emergence of suicidal ideation. Some cases reports of
<BR>
akathisia or suicidal ideation with other selective serotonin
<BR>
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) suggest that same mechanisms
<BR>
(pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions) are involved
<BR>
in extrapyramidal effects during treatment with SSRIs. The
<BR>
clinical use of SRIs is discussed.

<BR>
<P>Although antidepressant medications represent the cornerstone
<BR>
of treatment for patients with moderate to severe clinical
<BR>
depression, they also carry serious risks. There is evidence
<BR>
which suggests that antidepressants can, in rare instances,
<BR>
induce or exacerbate suicidal tendencies. Nine clinical
<BR>
mechanisms have been proposed through which this may occur.
<BR>
These are: (a) energizing depressed patients to act on pre-
<BR>
existing suicidal ideation; (b) paradoxically worsening
<BR>
depression; (c) inducing akathisia with associated self-
<BR>
destructive or aggressive impulses; (d) inducing panic
<BR>
attacks; (e) switching patients into manic or mixed states;
<BR>
(f) producing severe insomnia or interfering with sleep
<BR>
architecture; (g) inducing an organic obsessional state;
<BR>
(h) producing an organic personality disorder with borderline
<BR>
features; and (i) exacerbating or inducing electroencephalogram
<BR>
(EEG) or other neurological disturbances. Epidemiological and
<BR>
controlled studies also provide data on the association between
<BR>
antidepressant drugs and suicidal ideation, attempts and
<BR>
fatalities. These include studies which: (a) suggest that
<BR>
electroconvulsive therapy may be more effective than
<BR>
antidepressant drugs in reducing the frequency of suicide
<BR>
attempts; (b) indicate that antidepressants may differ in
<BR>
their capacity to reduce the frequency of suicide attempts;
<BR>
(c) find that more overdose attempts were made by patients
<BR>
receiving maprotiline than placebo; and (d) suggest that
<BR>
fluoxetine may be associated with a greater risk of inducing
<BR>
de novo suicidal ideation. Evidence suggests that antidepressants
<BR>
may vary by at least 15-fold in the number of fatal overdoses
<BR>
per million prescriptions. Estimated overdose proclivity rates
<BR>
were derived after adjusting the fatal toxicity data by the
<BR>
therapeutic index of the drug. These rates were very consistent
<BR>
between agents with the same pharmacological properties, and
<BR>
correlated well with known overdose risk rates for amitriptyline,
<BR>
mianserin and maprotiline. Estimated overdose proclivity rates
<BR>
suggest that the highly selective noradrenaline (norepinephrine)
<BR>
uptake inhibitors (desipramine, nortriptyline, maprotiline) may
<BR>
be associated with a greater risk for overdose than more mixed
<BR>
uptake inhibitors and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
<BR>
Antidepressants are not uniformly neutral in regard to suicidal
<BR>
ideation and attempts. Data clearly demonstrate that antidepressants
<BR>
ameliorate suicidal ideation more effectively than placebo in
<BR>
patients with depression. Although antidepressants diminish
<BR>
suicidal ideation in many recipients, about as many patients
<BR>
experience worsening suicidal ideation on active medication as
<BR>
they do on placebo. Furthermore, at least as many patients
<BR>
attempted suicide on fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants
<BR>
as on placebo, and more patients attempted to overdose on
<BR>
maprotiline than placebo. These observations suggest that
<BR>
antidepressants may redistribute suicide risk, attenuating
<BR>
risk in some patients who respond well, while possible enhancing
<BR>
risk in others who respond more poorly.
