<EM>&gt;  &gt; On the other hand, at 9 days into the 1929 series above the index was

<EM>&gt;  &gt; down 30%, while NASDAQ is only down 20% over the previous nine days.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; That's a pretty significant difference, especially in terms of market

<EM>&gt;  &gt; psychology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I agree that the current situation is not like 1929- today's bubblicious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stock mania, massive credit creation excesses, consumer and corporate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;debt loads, current account deficit, real estate inflation, surreal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government statistics, fraudulent accounting practices in technology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;firms like Lucent, Intel, IBM, Microsoft, etc., gold banking implosion-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in-the-making, bank derivatives exposures (ala LTCM writ large), and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so forth ad nauseum make the crash/depression of 1929-1939 look like a speed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bump.
</EM><BR>
<P>I couldn't disagree more. The strictness of accounting standards is much 
<BR>
tougher now than then. There are problems, but they are problems that 
<BR>
probably understate* the value of companies. For instance, more and more 
<BR>
value is in the form of hard to measure intangibles. There's a lot of 
<BR>
literature on this that I could suggest. (Do a search for Baruch Lev for 
<BR>
starters. What is this about consumer debt loads? You mean the $21 billion 
<BR>
dollars in cash held by MSFT, or the huge amounts at other companies? Today 
<BR>
is also unlike 1929 in that Greenspan would never let the money supply fall 
<BR>
by a third as the Fed did back then, turning a stock market crash into an 
<BR>
economic depression.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Well, that is Federal Reserve Corporation's party line. It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all you will hear on their media. Let's have a look:

</EM><BR>
<P>You just have to look at the names of the URLs you give above to see that 
<BR>
they are hardly objective, disinterested sources!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I find it rather simple. If a company loses money consistently (amazon.com,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;biotech.com), cooks the books (Lucent, Microstrategy, etc.), has a P/E
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the hundreds or thousands (Yahoo!, Cisco, MSFT, etc.)- meaning it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will require hundreds or thousands of years to pay for itself, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that company is grotesquely overvalued.
</EM><BR>
<P>Forrest, at least get your numbers straight. MSFT's P/E (*before* today's 
<BR>
17% haircut) was a mere 47. And remember, that's without backing out $21 
<BR>
billion in cash holdings (Not to mention a similar amount in unrealized 
<BR>
investment gains.) Yes, Cisco is pretty expensive, but it's also positioned 
<BR>
at the center of the New Economy and continues to grow rapidly. Looking at 
<BR>
very high P/Es of a Yahoo in isolation is meaningless. It's forward P/Es 
<BR>
and PEG ratios that matter. If a young company has just made a small profit 
<BR>
but is growing rapidly, an astronomical PE can fall very fast looking ahead.
<BR>
<P>I disagree with most of the rest of your post, but that's all I'm going to 
<BR>
comment on for now. This thread would probably be best suited to the 
<BR>
Investing in the Future forum.
