<EM>&gt; &gt; Just a theory, but maybe...
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; * In order to effectively use these technologies, one must acquire a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   lot of knowledge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; * In the process of acquiring said knowledge, people typically learn of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   ways to solve problems better (cheaper/faster/more effective) than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   violence and mass slaughter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; * By the time one amasses the facilities and knowledge to actually use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   these in a terrorist capacity, one has usually moved beyond terrorist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   tactics and onto tactics that actually accomplish whatever ends were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   desired.  (Exception: if one is extremely devoted to a cause that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   acknolwedges no solution except death to one's enemies, for instance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   with the Iraqi weapons labs.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Does this seem plausible, or is there some major logic hole that I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; seeing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not sure, but isn't the fact that several major dictators have got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite solid academic educations a problem for this model? I seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recall that Pol Pot went to Sorbonne, the current Bhutan junta to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Harvard and so on. Of course, they might have majored in the wrong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specialities :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well...it takes a different mentality to lead an army of ignorant
<BR>
buillies, than to oversee a group of educated scientists.  Quite
<BR>
probably, almost any person on this list - on the slightly inaccurate
<BR>
assumption that this list is representative of people who are at least
<BR>
slightly informed about the most powerful new technologies of today -
<BR>
would not stand to have suggestions for improvements ignored and
<BR>
unappreciated day after day if a better option (defection to the other
<BR>
side with lots of classified info) were available.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Overally, I think your model explains part of why we do not see hordes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of well educated terrorists. But I still see enough engineers with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good knowledge of engineering and an apalling lack of sociology to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make me suspect there are other reasons too.
</EM><BR>
<P>The pursuit of knowledge and true power makes one less interested in the
<BR>
pursuit of power over people?
