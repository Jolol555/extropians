<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I bought SuSe on a CD that was part of a linux book, that retailed for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; $49.00. I bought it on remainder at a used book store for $15. A used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; dual processor server I just bought from a guy for $50 happened to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; a Red Hat cd stuck in the drive (and he just moved out to Arizona, oh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; well ;) ), so you could say i got that for free. But I doubt that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; people are as cheap as I am. Both are 'previous release' issues, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I've likewise seen Windows 3.1 and Win95 disks available for nothing or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; next to nothing in similar venues...Buying the latest release of an OS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; is not likely to be gotten for free or next to nothing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes it is. You can always download the latest version of RedHat, SuSE,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Mandrake, Debian, Slackware, and all the others I could come up with, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; obtain the CD for $2-3.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The issue isn't downloads, its hardcopy, and I'd be very interested in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finding sources of cds for 2-3 dollars. 
</EM><BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.cheapbytes.com">http://www.cheapbytes.com</A> is a good US source. Most of the major
<BR>
distributions can be had for $1.99
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 100M or more, especially if your local phone usage rates are not capped,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is less than going out and buying the CD.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not if you're in the UK :(
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Knowing cd production costs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are losing money distributing at that rate. Moreover, the business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; models of companies like these are focused on making money on tech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support. I doubt very much that half of the linux companies will be in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business in a year or two.
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably a lot will die off, but that's the free market :). The open source
<BR>
business model is viable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Corel is a rather unusual example (it includes some commercial software,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; namely the personal version of WordPerfect).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, and Corel is also coming out with linux versions of all of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications. It intends to give Microsoft a run for its money through a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; user freindly version of the linux platform and a full linux product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; line, so long as they don't run out of money first. Michael Cowpland,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CEO fo Corel, seems to be afflicted with the gee-whiz virus, and even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though they are short onf cash, went ahead and bought Kai, at the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time that they are finalizing their Borland/Inprise merger. He is doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little to improve existing applications, preferring a strategy of making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications pay for their own improvements. Ventura, for example, is in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many ways a superior DTP application to Quark, PageMaker, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FrameMaker, but lacks some features that I consider to be of utmost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; importance to be truly wonderful (though few other DTP apps offer them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either, and in the rare cases they do, they are expensive aftermarket
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plug-ins from third parties.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Sun have produced StarOffice, which is fully compatible with MS Office
<BR>
and free for personal non-commercial use. It's distributed with several
<BR>
of the Linux distributions.
<BR>
<P>With a combination of StarOffice and, say, Mandrake or SuSE, I think Linux
<BR>
is already a very viable desktop alternative to Windows for a lot more
<BR>
people than many realise.
<BR>
<P>(I would add Corel to that list, but their distribution is currently a
<BR>
little quirky - I look forward to the next version).
<BR>
<P><P>(my own systems, in case anyone's wondering, are custom and self-built
<BR>
from source)
<BR>
