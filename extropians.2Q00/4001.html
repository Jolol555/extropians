<EM>&gt; &gt;I'm curious what would happen if MicroSoft simply announced that they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;no intentions of breaking up the company, and intend to just go on with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;business as usual, disregarding government orders, and that they would no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;longer bother to even show up at the trial. Whoever made the decision could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be arrested, and if this included enough people, MS could cease to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;function.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;What would be the effect on the economy, and would the government be smart
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;enough to know this effect and not arrest them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What if they announced that if the state attempted to break them up, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they were sorry, but they couldn't then be bothered to fix the bug in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OS that would destroy the data on every system using it in the near future?
</EM><BR>
<P>They're arrogant enough that such is not beyond all possibility.  Of
<BR>
course, you can bet that several non-MS people would find a way to fix
<BR>
that bug, given as their jobs (and $millions) would depend on it.  MS
<BR>
would probably try to sue, but it would be thrown out of court after yet
<BR>
another &quot;spontaneous&quot; gathering of &quot;save our heros&quot; legal defenses.
<BR>
<P>As suggested, I think it might be amusing if MS decided to dissolve
<BR>
rather than allow itself to be broken up - or, maybe, it would just sell
<BR>
all of its IP rights and other property to Bill Gates for $0.01 then
<BR>
dissolve, and Gates would found another company that just happened to
<BR>
work much like Microsoft.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P>I hope Gates &amp; co. don't read this list.  That might actually work.
