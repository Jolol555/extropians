If the nation state continues into the epoch of fast interplanetary rocket 
<BR>
travel (and no  Singularity yet) China let's say; then interplanetary land 
<BR>
grabs should occur. Remind me of Ben Bova's stories.

<P>&lt;&lt; A nation that says you should not be able to &quot;claim&quot; the land could take
<BR>
&nbsp;action to ruin whatever land you live on (if not by outright military
<BR>
&nbsp;action, then possibly by sending all kinds of probes to do &quot;experiments&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;right in your way, where you touching them or interfering with them in
<BR>
&nbsp;any way would be an excuse for armed conflict); or, if you set up trade,
<BR>
&nbsp;or at least resupply, runs with someone still on Earth, then just
<BR>
&nbsp;interfering with that someone.  That they would gain nothing from it is
<BR>
&nbsp;beside the point: they would feel more secure without someone that does
<BR>
&nbsp;not report to them living so dramatically outside their perceived reach. &gt;&gt;
