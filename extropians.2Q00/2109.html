<EM>&gt; &gt; Perhaps there are other people who think I am stupid, sentimental or sloppy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in my thinking, but you are the only one who consistently says it.  If you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cannot disagree with my ideas without calling them stupid, please do not read 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; my posts or respond to them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That phenomenon is interesting, and seems to be an effect of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting interaction: (1) I read all posts made, in order, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no heed to poster or thread; (2) When I see any opinion or idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expressed that I have strong opinions about, I respond with my own,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quoting only the words being responded to;
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been applying a very similar approach to the Working Within the
<BR>
System thread. Which was getting a little heated between myself and
<BR>
Michael at first. My policy was simply to correct any erroneous
<BR>
information I noticed where I had direct knowledge otherwise.
<BR>
<P>This has helped, in my opinion, to maintain objectivity on a subject
<BR>
that frequently leads down to flame. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Politeness is a disease I have no use for.
</EM><BR>
<P>Whilst I well understand and appreciate your recognition of the
<BR>
pointlessness of politeness, you have to bear in mind that not everyone
<BR>
adheres to this and many will take personal offence easily. Once there's
<BR>
opinions flying around and things becoming personal, it becomes very
<BR>
difficult to have a useful discussion.
<BR>
<P>So I maintain politeness for (backwards?) compatibility. And of course,
<BR>
because I'm English... 
<BR>
<P>I'm not saying you should have to, but it's a useful trick that works
<BR>
for me. For the record, you can be as impolite to me as you want too.
<BR>
