Zero, I like what you've had to say. Defending communism (or is that
<BR>
socialism?) on this list is a brave move!!!
<BR>
<P>A distinction should really be made between Marxism, which is a bunch of
<BR>
interesting stuff with a very democratic edge to it, and
<BR>
Leninism/Stalinism/et al ism, which is what was put into practice in the
<BR>
&quot;communist&quot; countries, and which actually bears little resemblance to what
<BR>
Marx had to say. State socialism as practiced in the 20th century has been
<BR>
shown to fail (under less than ideal circumstances; that is, plonked in the
<BR>
middle of a 300+ year old world capitalist system, which was extremely
<BR>
hostile to it). Marxism, idealistic as it is, has never really had a run. I
<BR>
think that Zero's point that socialism can work well in an abundant future
<BR>
has merit. Certainly capitalism will also &quot;work&quot;, as in continuing, but
<BR>
measuring it along any metrics related to equity are going to show enormous
<BR>
shortcomings, more so as technology provides more surplus without the need
<BR>
for human labour, because the surplus produced by technology is just not
<BR>
going to get around.
<BR>
<P>I'm hoping marxism doesn't get a run, unless someone can postulate a dynamic
<BR>
variant. The self-organising power of dynamic social systems is well
<BR>
demonstrated by capitalism, nasty beast that it is, and that's something I
<BR>
wouldn't like to see lost.

<EM>&gt; &gt;Look, everyone goes through a &quot;socialist&quot; phase, I did to. But the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reality is it doesn't work unless you put a gun to peoples heads.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;After a good taste of capitalism socialism won't do except for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;those who have a &quot;perfectly good reason&quot; why they won't pull their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;own weight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not saying communism has worked in the past.  I'm not saying it works
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the present.  I'm saying that it has possibilities for the future,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially if/when material wealth becomes equivolent to information.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm a willing capitalist now.  But there are many in our society who don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have my luck and/or ability.  Some of them live at a level of subsistence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which IMO is beneath that fit for a human.  That saddens me.  I believe
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; someday we'll be able to do better.  That's *all* I was saying.
