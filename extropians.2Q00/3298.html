<P>In the text above, you use what some linguists call &quot;is of identify&quot;.
<BR>
Does all your words &quot;red&quot; above really point at the same concept &lt;red&gt;?
<BR>
<P>In the standard discussion among humans on this matter, one can easily
<BR>
remove the problem using the General Semantics method ``indexing'':
<BR>
<P>\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
<BR>
There exists a defined wavelength of light called red[1].
<BR>
There exists a defined sensory cone in the eye that exists called a red[2]-
<BR>
receptor.
<BR>
There exists a defined chemical loss in the retina associated with red[3].
<BR>
There exists a defined signal along the optic nerve that denotes red[4].
<BR>
There exists a defined perception in the brain called red[5].
<BR>
There exists a defined memory encoding that stores red[6].
<BR>
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
<BR>
<P>Do you mean to state that all red[k] (k=1,...,6) refer to the same phenomenon?
<BR>
<P>You know, there exists a complication here with the fuzziness of the natural
<BR>
languages: The ``eye'' you refer to above really does not exist.
<BR>
<P>There exists a number of different eyes, and eye[&quot;Person 1&quot;] and
<BR>
eye[&quot;Person 2&quot;] do not necessarily have the same receptiveness for light,
<BR>
and thus can (and will) give a somewhat different reception for the same
<BR>
input light.
<BR>
<P>Person 1 will state that the eye sensory input matches ``red'' while Person 2
<BR>
will vehemently state that it does not.  They use different definitions of the
<BR>
word ``red''.
<BR>
<P>One could of course define the meaning ``red'' with a physical characteristic:
<BR>
``The word &quot;red&quot; refers to the colour of light with a wavelength between
<BR>
460 and 780 nm.''. [This probably won't match what _your eyes report, BTW. !-]
<BR>
<P>Then one could either call humans who do not follow this rule ``colour blind''
<BR>
(optically challenged?) or ``mistaken'' (semantically challenged?).

A rose by any other name would smell as sweet
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Suggesting that a thing is what it is,
</EM><BR>
not what it is called. Wally Argus, a correspondent from Alabama, reports that
<BR>
the reference was a side-swipe that the Globe Theatre's rival the Rose Theatre
<BR>
which had less than effective sanitary arrangements.
