<EM>&gt; I tend to lurk more than post here, but if I were to try to sum up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extropian values in one sentence, it would be this: to create and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; harness technology for the purpose of extending the length and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improving the quality of human life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That seems to be a noble and practical goal, until one delves deeper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and asks: why?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The answer is obvious, and can be expressed by saying the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing in even simpler language: we want to live long, healthy and happy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lives.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps.  There may also be other reasons.  For instance, there may well
<BR>
be people who want life extension and such available to others, but who
<BR>
fully intend to commit suicide once that goal is accomplished - i.e.,
<BR>
they want to create an extropian future, they'd just rather not live in
<BR>
it themselves for whatever reason.  They would still be extropians, and
<BR>
the rest of us would benefit from their (finite) contribution just the
<BR>
same.
<BR>
<P>(In order to emphasize the logic here, and de-emphasize any emotional
<BR>
content:
<BR>
FOO = extropian
<BR>
BAR = live long/healthy/happy lives)
<BR>
<P>Therefore the set of people who want to BAR is not the same as, nor a
<BR>
superset of, all FOOs.  Therefore, BAR can not be ascribed as a logical
<BR>
trait of such, though it is probably the case that it is an attribute of
<BR>
most FOOs.  One may well be FOO in support of doing non-FOO (though
<BR>
hopefully not anti-FOO) things; that does not, in itself, change the
<BR>
fact that the non-FOO activity is non-FOO, and extensive discussion of
<BR>
such might in fact be annoying to people in a place they thought was for
<BR>
the discussion of FOO stuff (for instance, how to make the world more
<BR>
like FOO ideals)...unless, of course, the discussion is linked back into
<BR>
FOO things, for instance &quot;how to use this seemingly non-FOO activity to
<BR>
support FOO stuff,&quot; or, &quot;are there a lot of people who like FOO stuff
<BR>
who also like this non-FOO thing?&quot;
<BR>
<P>(Though note the dicussion has to be and *stay* linked into FOO things;
<BR>
merely linking it into how to BAR is not, by itself, enough, and if it
<BR>
strays into non-FOO for the sake of non-FOO, then it has become off
<BR>
topic.  Thus, &quot;I want FOO things so I can BAR so I can do non-FOO
<BR>
things,&quot; is only on topic in &quot;I want FOO things so I can BAR.&quot;  But, &quot;I
<BR>
want to do FOO things and non-FOO things and here is the balance I
<BR>
strike,&quot; speaks to the balance - if it is a balance, no matter how
<BR>
heavily weighted towards either side, and not, &quot;I want to devote my life
<BR>
to non-FOO things, so I'm not doing any FOO things.&quot;  I think the
<BR>
objection was that this thread was becoming this last one.  This is not
<BR>
to say that non-FOO stuff is, in itself, necessarily bad - just that it
<BR>
is misplaced here.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You must also face the sobering fact that you may simply die before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life extension techniques become available.  If that's the case,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hedging your bets and living life to it's fullest NOW (keeping a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; watchful eye on, and hopefully supporting, extropian values) is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly in line with being extropian.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps.  But merely living life to its fullest *without taking even
<BR>
such minimal action as making reservations for life-insurance-funded
<BR>
cryo* (unless you sincerely believe that life extension will be
<BR>
available to you before you would need cryo, sufficient that you will
<BR>
never need cryo) disagrees with most definitions of extropy that I have
<BR>
heard.  Giving only moral support is also termed &quot;lip service&quot;, and is
<BR>
known as a way to claim to be - and perhaps even honestly believe one is
<BR>
(or delude oneself into thinking one is) - supporting something when one
<BR>
is not, in fact, supporting it.
<BR>
<P>This seems, in general, to be one of the problems with new ideas like
<BR>
those we discuss here: people believe in them, and believe that their
<BR>
belief by itself will cause the ideas to become reality (perhaps by
<BR>
getting them to randomly mention it to someone who can do something
<BR>
about it and would support the idea, without seeking said person out).
<BR>
If only such were true...  &lt;depressed sigh&gt;
<BR>
<P>(Yeah, yeah, I know: once nanotech and cybernetics are here, and once
<BR>
human psychology is far better understood, one could build a literal
<BR>
daydream machine that *would* get these things going just because
<BR>
someone thought of it.  ^_- )
