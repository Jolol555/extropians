[Non-member submission]
<BR>
<P>Well, though I rarely have the time to skim through all the masses of
<BR>
e-mails that go around this list, this one got my attention because of the
<BR>
fact, that someone draws false conclusions out of obvious facts:
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Washington DC also has one of the most restrictive gun laws in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the country. Name any other high crime city in the US, and you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; will find a city with extremely restrictive gun laws.
</EM><BR>
That seems to be true. As I do not live in the US, I would not try to
<BR>
question this, though I read some foreign newspapers. But Washington is
<BR>
renowned for its criminals even in Germany.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; As I've said before, almost everyone I have known personally that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; has visited europe has been robbed at least once while they were
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; there, they've had their hotel rooms robbed, their cars broken
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; into or stolen, and bags snatched out of their hands.
</EM><BR>
That might be true, but then I wonder what places all these people have
<BR>
visited. I live in Europe for almost thirty years now and I wasn't robbed
<BR>
till now. Most people I know haven't been victims to anything more than
<BR>
perhaps burglary. By the way, I cannot not think of any method to secure my
<BR>
car by means of wepaonry than to fix some claymore mines to it - and that
<BR>
would certainly exceed any reasonable use of force.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; The brazenness of theives in europe to me is incredible, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; testament to the fact that they know there is little a person can
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; do to defend themselves against robbery in europe. I've heard
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; many stories of women mugged and raped with bystanders just
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; walking by, ignoring what went on. Non-gun crime is so prevalent
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I believe that most people there just don't see it, or refuse to see it.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
I would certainly not want to live in a state where it is legal to shoot
<BR>
someone who is only a thief. That would mean to equal the worth of the human
<BR>
life with that of property which seems inadequate. But this theory can also
<BR>
work the other way round, which is the case in Germany: Three friends of
<BR>
mine were playing cards on the balcony of their appartment when they heard
<BR>
the desperate cries of a woman. They rushed to rescue her and found a man
<BR>
trying to rape a young girl. Luckily they arrived in time and gave the
<BR>
criminal the beating of his life. After that, they called the police. The
<BR>
criminal sued them for severe injury. In the end, the criminal was sentenced
<BR>
less hard than those who had helped the victim. And that is definitely not
<BR>
just!
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; It bothers me that my father who lives in New York City and is a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; former courier who carried a sidearm cannot now do so.  But he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; does live right next door to a large NYPD precinct house! lol  He
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; likes to eat lunch at a local bar &amp; grill with a group of friends
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; who are homicide detectives and share with him some juicy stories
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; over food.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM> &gt; New York City and Washington D.C. are two places where lawful
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; citizens should absolutely be allowed to easily get permits to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; carry a sidearm.  Would it lower the victimization rates I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; wonder?  It might also cause criminals to &quot;raise the bar&quot; to a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; new level of viciousness but, so be it.  I don't feel the need to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; carry a handgun in Anchorage but if I were visiting the big apple
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I would sure want one.
</EM><BR>
That is one fact. In Europe, possession of arms is restricted. But the &quot;bad
<BR>
guys&quot; also have limited weapons. If you would allow anyone to carry weapons,
<BR>
then the bad guys will certainly carry them. Although I would have prefered
<BR>
to have a gun as long as I lived in Frankfurt, I doubt that it would have
<BR>
done any good. If you are unarmed, well, you can get beaten up or robbed.
<BR>
Okay. If you are armed, you get shot. Okay, if you are a combat-trained
<BR>
gunslinger, you might be able to shoot them, but most people aren't. So this
<BR>
is no big defense. The bad guys usually have more guns, more firepower and,
<BR>
ost important, the least problems of using them.
<BR>
<P>Weapons do no harm. It's the people who use them. Most of the people who
<BR>
have guns neve use them. At least not on other people. Even most criminals
<BR>
would not deliberately use excessive force to achieve their goal. If all
<BR>
people have guns, the criminal is forced to use maximum force to achieve
<BR>
their goal without danger for themselves. The problem of liberal gun laws is
<BR>
that the tendency to use them will increase.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I have heard stories of severe thievery in Europe and on a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; sophisticated level that dates back centuries.  I did not know
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; they suffered from apathy when it comes to intervening in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; situations such as an ongoing rape.  I know that has happened in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the United States.  What parts of Europe are you talking about?
</EM><BR>
Well, that is indeed a problem. A 17 year old girl was raped in Hamburg, by
<BR>
day (!) and in a crowded local train (!!). I do not understand hos something
<BR>
like this can happen in my country. Though I made the shocking experience
<BR>
that this is common in this country, though rarely in such an extreme case.
<BR>
Most violations are never reported due to the shame of the victims, which
<BR>
makes it only worse. The problem here is not guns but simply the way of
<BR>
thinking. As long as this does not change, the way people behave will not
<BR>
change.
<BR>
<P>If we look at the overall facts, crimes like burglary or robbery might be
<BR>
more frequent in Europe. But definitely the rate of murder and other capital
<BR>
crimes is much higher in the US. If faced with the choice, I would always
<BR>
prefer Europe. Property can be restored, that's why we have insurances. But
<BR>
no insurance can give you back your life.
<BR>
<P>Like the Romans said: Ab igne ignem. - Out of the fire - fire.
<BR>

know, my son, with how little witt this world is being ruled?
