<P>&lt;&lt; Immigration policy is one area that exposure to well-presented libertarian 
<BR>
&nbsp;ideas has had an effect on my thinking over the last ten years.  I live in 
<BR>
&nbsp;one of the most ethnically heterogeneous cities in the US (perhaps in the 
<BR>
&nbsp;world) and I see signs of the vitality this &quot;people gumbo&quot; brings to my 
<BR>
&nbsp;community everywhere.  Many of these immigrants in Houston are illegal under 
<BR>
&nbsp;US law.  They all seem to be working hard and contributing to the progress 
<BR>
of 
<BR>
&nbsp;the area.  Yes, if we opened the borders entirely we'd probably be swamped 
<BR>
by 
<BR>
&nbsp;economic refugees beyond the ability of our infrastructure to respond.  But 
<BR>
I 
<BR>
&nbsp;think we could steadily increase the permeability of our borders and still 
<BR>
&nbsp;maintain our prosperity. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
It might be helpful to use some quotes from economic reports from Top 
<BR>
Economists from Universities and Financial institutions to butress this 
<BR>
observation. I am interested if this indeed is economic fact or just a part 
<BR>
of Libertarian Ideology. Which path should we go? Does proetctionism ever 
<BR>
make sense? Is there any danger from foreign workers, or just paranoia from 
<BR>
native born Americans?
