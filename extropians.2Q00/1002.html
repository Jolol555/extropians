However, I'd like to note in passing that _no_ country today is a utopia, or 
<BR>
has abolished poverty, or has abolished civil rights abuses. Some are better 
<BR>
than others, but that's as far as it goes -- and even then, the relative 
<BR>
position varies depending on your status within your own culture.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I totally agree with you.  As I said in my post, there is still much to be 
<BR>
done, even in the United States.  But again, the U.S. does have much to be 
<BR>
proud of in terms of making the world a better place, as does the United 
<BR>
Kingdom.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
Maybe my perceptions are coloured by just having finished reading a
<BR>
history of the first world war; but patriotism is a particularly dangerous 
<BR>
emotion -- especially when it's directed outward and expressed as contempt 
<BR>
for those who _don't_ do everything the way we do it over here.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I think rational patriotism can be easily perverted in dangerous ways.  And 
<BR>
a common way is to develop contempt for other nations, especially those that 
<BR>
are in opposition or culturally very different.

For starters, nationalism -- which is inextricably linked with patriotism -- 
<BR>
is deeply anti-libertarian. _Any_ ideology that tries to fit people into 
<BR>
pigeon-holes is to some extent anti-extropian, and nationalism, which in 
<BR>
extreme cases subordinates the individual to the state, is exactly that.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Out of control nationalism is strongly linked with patriotism, but the 
<BR>
perversion of it that I discussed above.  I can see the point of your 
<BR>
statement that any ideology that tries to pigeon-hole people is to some 
<BR>
extent anti-extropian.
<BR>
<P>And yet isn't extropianism an ideology also that has guiding principles to 
<BR>
'influence' or even 'pigeon-hole' members?  I realize that Max has written 
<BR>
&quot;these Principles are not presented as absolute truths or universal values.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just playing devil's advocate here.
<BR>
<P>you continues:
<BR>
I'd also like to note that from a non-American perspective making children 
<BR>
swear an oath of allegiance in school each day looks positively Orwellian, 
<BR>
and I don't see massive military power as being admirable, either.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I sure don't consider children taking the oath of allegiance to be 
<BR>
'brainwashing!'  There is nothing similar in England? I am surprised.  The 
<BR>
sad thing is that as a schoolboy in the U.S., I did not have the meaning of 
<BR>
it really explained to me.  I remember my friends and I purposely changing 
<BR>
the words to be 'funny' and making eachother laugh.  But generally I took it 
<BR>
seriously and felt patriotic as I spoke the words.  I would want any future 
<BR>
child of mine to continue taking the pledge.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
For seconds, it amounts to an unpleasant delegation of the divine right of 
<BR>
kings to the national government. Back before the age of enlightenment, 
<BR>
kings ruled by divine fiat. Now we don't have kings, so we have nations to 
<BR>
which we're supposed to be loyal. Why? What do they do to deserve such 
<BR>
loyalty? A social contract is all very well, but when it pulls on jack-boots 
<BR>
and starts marching over the border it's time to ask some searching 
<BR>
questions.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I have never thought of the connection with the divine right of kings, very 
<BR>
interesting.  The social contract between the citizen, other citizens and 
<BR>
their government is supposed to bind us together in mutual self-interest.  
<BR>
And at least in theory, when a citizen or group of them want to change 
<BR>
something, the mechanisms are in place to at least give them the chance at 
<BR>
being heard and having something done about it.
<BR>
<P>I still think much of the authority of the gov't does come from the law 
<BR>
enforcement departments and the military, or in other words, from the barrel 
<BR>
of a gun.  But being a democracy, we have ways of changing things that don't 
<BR>
entail starting a violent revolution! lol  Unlike some other nations where 
<BR>
that is a regular occurence.
<BR>
<P>I think citizens of any nation should be thinking hard about what is going 
<BR>
on in their nation and what they are going to do long before the leadership 
<BR>
decide to invade a neighbor for the greater glory of the state.  Nazi, 
<BR>
Germany is a great example of this and some Germans did try to stand up for 
<BR>
what was right despite the majority going along with things.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
The national system we've been bequeathed is just a degenerate form
<BR>
of the monarchical system, with the powers devolved to a national level 
<BR>
which is just a replacement for the Crown.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Modern democracies are just a degenerate form of the monarchial system?  For 
<BR>
reasons stated above I would have to disagree.  I can see some connection 
<BR>
but not the wholesale link you do.  I appreciate having the vast power one 
<BR>
man used to have as king being spread around with various branches of 
<BR>
government that are limited by checks and balances.  And we can try to 
<BR>
influence or change things without being hung or imprisoned if the king 
<BR>
really dislikes the idea.
<BR>
<P>I do think I understand your point as being that ultimately, the federal 
<BR>
gov'ts of even democracies still have incredible power over the citizenry, 
<BR>
even if it is generally more fairly used.  And we are expected as citizens 
<BR>
to be generally loyal subjects to not a king anymore, but our flag and p.m. 
<BR>
or president.
<BR>
<P>I wrote:
<BR>
I fervently hope that in the first world and especially in the United  
<BR>
States, that dialogue and change can be done in productive and peaceful 
<BR>
ways.  Rather then an elimination of the U.S. government, I see changes that 
<BR>
would simply reduce its size and influence, while handing over much more 
<BR>
power to the people.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
I agree with you about the hope -- but I'm not optimistic. People with
<BR>
vested interests in the existing system don't welcome change unless it is 
<BR>
clearly going to benefit them. We also see signs of really irrational 
<BR>
behaviour in existing fields; see, for example, the conduct of the war on 
<BR>
drugs. (It doesn't make sense, but it's _still_ going on.)
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I agree that people with vested interests within the hierarchy of power will 
<BR>
most likely try to maintain the status quo in various ways.  It will be 
<BR>
fascinating to see if a half-century or so from now, if people stay fairly 
<BR>
'content' or if a boiling point is reached with the public and fairly 
<BR>
radical libertarian ideas are instituted.  Nanotech, AI and superlongevity 
<BR>
will certainly have a good chance of 'freeing the mind' of many people.
<BR>
<P>At least with the war on drugs some progress is being made.  Last I heard, a 
<BR>
bill was about to be made law that limits the power of law enforcement 
<BR>
agencies to make 'lawful' searches and seizures.  The Rico act had turned 
<BR>
police departments into money-hungry treasure hunters looking to enrich 
<BR>
themselves.

I suppose for me the acid test is, do you feel pride and a touch of
<BR>
emotion when US Navy ships fire cruise missiles at factories in some
<BR>
other country because of a rumour (no more!) that they're supplying
<BR>
nasty raw materials to a third party?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Initially, when I hear we are shooting cruise missiles at terrorist-aiding 
<BR>
facilities, yes, I do feel pride that we are doing something.  But later, if 
<BR>
I hear U.S. intelligence sources were wrong and that innocents were hurt and 
<BR>
killed, then I feel very sad about it.
<BR>
<P>Sometimes in cases like this the military is not to blame, they are 
<BR>
receiving information and taking orders from other parts of the government.  
<BR>
Ultimately though, it is all part of the same government.  The U.S. should 
<BR>
only act when we have solid intelligence and the reason for the cruise 
<BR>
missile launch is to impede aggressors and not to boost presidential 
<BR>
ratings.
<BR>
<P>So Charlie, how do you think the U.S. and British government should deal 
<BR>
with terrorist (aggressor) nations and organizations?  How would you handle 
<BR>
them?  Would P.M. Stross ever order bombing raids?  And what would cause him 
<BR>
to?

Being proud of having built something good is one thing. Being proud
<BR>
of having the ability to kick someone else's work over is something else ...
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I take pride in seeing my nation kick some else's work over when their work 
<BR>
is going to be used for unjust aggression.  Kicking over Saddam Hussein's or 
<BR>
Omar Quadaffi's pile of blocks is no problem to me.
<BR>
<P>Remember the Falkland Islands?  Now, that was a patriotic scene with all 
<BR>
those Brits waving at the ships loaded down with troops and equipment to 
<BR>
stop those vicious Argentines from trying to control land right off their 
<BR>
shores. ;)
<BR>
<P>Charlie, I do realize we live in a complex world and that the U.S. did help 
<BR>
create some of these bullies that later we have to knock down a notch or 
<BR>
two.  And the uses and abuses of foreign aid have already been discussed on 
<BR>
the list recently.
<BR>
<P>The next forty years are going to be very interesting.  I enjoy your posts 
<BR>
and hope over the years to get your take on things.  When I am reanimated 
<BR>
from my cryonic 'slumber' I look forward to hearing your views on the late 
<BR>
21st century(I'm hoping you will be around).  If you like what you see, I 
<BR>
will know things are ok!
