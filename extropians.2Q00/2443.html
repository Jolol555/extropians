<EM> &gt; &gt;Linux and Mac users are happily immune to the ill effects of ILOVEYOU,

<EM> &gt; Blame a company for not being infallible?  If those are the standards,
</EM><BR>
then
<BR>
<EM> &gt; I'm afraid that *no* O/S can live up to them.  The crime isn't on MS'
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hands, it is on the proliferation of the virus.
</EM><BR>
<P>No one expects a company to be infallible.  The point of the article is that
<BR>
Microsoft has been warned for years by security professionals that their
<BR>
software has the backdoors. Security professionals originally thought they
<BR>
were bugs, except that Microsoft says that they are &quot;features&quot;.  They were
<BR>
deliberately designed into the software and Microsoft refuses to take them
<BR>
out.  Even after a couple of years of people exploiting these backdoors,
<BR>
Microsoft still refuses to fix them.
<BR>
<P>These are deliberate back-doors put in the e-mail software to allow outside
<BR>
people to execute commands on your PC.  Microsoft insists on keeping these
<BR>
backdoors, because they use them for their own purposes.  They also refuse
<BR>
to add security so that they can only be used by Microsoft.  As a result,
<BR>
these backdoors are not only known to exist, but they are documented and
<BR>
advertised in Microsoft manuals on how to send executable scripts that run
<BR>
on other people's computer.
<BR>
<P>This is not a simple lack of infallibility.  This is sheer stupidity.
<BR>
Microsoft is deliberately and knowingly keeping these backdoors open because
<BR>
the Microsoft thinks that its desire to send commands to your computer
<BR>
easily outweighs your desire to not allow hackers to send commands to your
<BR>
computer easily.  Security professionals have asked Microsoft to fix these
<BR>
backdoors, and Microsoft claims that it would not be in their best interest
<BR>
to do so.
