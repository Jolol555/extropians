<P>
Sarah, I'm sure someone else will be better qualified to say what the
<BR>
Extropian line is on human genetic engineering.  Using the Extropian
<BR>
principles as a guideline, I would expect Extropians to be as totally
<BR>
against any sort of government regulation as you are. Of course certain
<BR>
people will try to control the course of human genetic research--it's too
<BR>
valuable a tool to escape that.  My greatest hope is that there are people
<BR>
who are obsessed enough with their research that they'll quietly continue
<BR>
doing it, regardless of the masses and their political leaders.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to thank you for the work you're doing on behalf of children.  I'm
<BR>
a long-time admirer of John Holt's work--I used to subscribe to his _Growing
<BR>
Without Schooling_  newsletter before he died.  I've only had time to skim
<BR>
through your web site so far, but I will definitely return for a more
<BR>
extensive look.
<BR>
<P>It's encouraging to see that even older children who've been tortured in
<BR>
schools and &quot;mental health&quot; institutions can take possession of themselves
<BR>
if given the opportunity.  I had a foster child several years ago who was
<BR>
considered incorrigible.  He'd been in and out of foster homes and
<BR>
institutions for most of his life; he had living parents, but they'd washed
<BR>
their hands of him  (interestingly, his mother was heavily involved with
<BR>
several charitable organizations ostensibly set up for the purpose of
<BR>
helping children with &quot;learning disabilities&quot; and other behavioral
<BR>
problems).  The supervisor of the foster child program placed the kid with
<BR>
me because, as he said, my psychological profile showed me to be unusually
<BR>
free of traits associated with &quot;co-dependency,&quot; and he thought it might be
<BR>
worthwhile to try something different.
<BR>
<P>The kid was 17, quite old enough to take care of himself, so I turned him
<BR>
over to himself, offering guidance if he requested it but otherwise leaving
<BR>
him alone.  For example, his former foster parents told me it was next to
<BR>
impossible to get him out of bed in the mornings and that mornings with this
<BR>
kid were like battle-scenes.  I told the kid something like this: &quot;I don't
<BR>
do wake-up calls.  Here's an alarm clock.  You can get up and work towards
<BR>
whatever goals you want to set for yourself, or you can sleep all day.  Your
<BR>
choice.&quot; He never once overslept while he was with me. During the few months
<BR>
he was with me, the kid got his GED, his driver's license, and a job as a
<BR>
mechanic's helper (cars were a major interest of his, so a job in a
<BR>
mechanic's shop was a triumph for him). The other foster parents were amazed
<BR>
at how the kid had turned around but were quite disappointed when they asked
<BR>
me what I'd done and I said, &quot;Nothing.  I just left him alone.&quot;  It seemed
<BR>
as though they all wanted to take some kind of action to control the kids.
<BR>
<P>I look forward to perusing your web site and to seeing more of your posts
<BR>
here.
<BR>
<P>Bonnie

Subject: Eugenics
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;At the policy level we will need global bans on altering the genes we pass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on to our children, and on reproductive human cloning. We'll also need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effective, accountable systems for regulating human genetic technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that may have some beneficent uses but could be dangerously abused.
</EM><BR>
<P>I confess that I have no idea what the Extropian line is on this,
<BR>
but I find it profoundly frightening.
