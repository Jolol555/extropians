<EM>&gt; Well, might be, though I'm quite sure to have taken the number shown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;manslaughter&quot;. But anyway, let's compare some others:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Violent crimes (murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and aggravated assault.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1998 US 1,532,044 equaling 566.4 crimes per 100,000 inhabitants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1998 D     76,079 equaling    93 crimes per 100,000 inhabitants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This means that the total number of violent crimes in the US is six times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greater than in Germany. I took the figures out of the FBI annual reports
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.fbi.gov">http://www.fbi.gov</A>) as well as the German BKA (<A HREF="http://www.bka.de">http://www.bka.de</A>). These
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are crimes, not defensive use by law abiding civilians or police.
</EM><BR>
<P>Keep in mind that many states that have restrictive gun laws take a very
<BR>
dim view of people actually defending themselves. As you stated with
<BR>
some cases in Germany, there are similar cases here, where people
<BR>
defended themselves in cases that would be quite justifiable in most
<BR>
other states, but wound up being convicted themselves of murder or
<BR>
manslaughter, or aggrevated assault. However, overall, that seems about
<BR>
right. I do wonder though, since you've noted some cases where people
<BR>
were victimized with nobody paying attension, what is the rate of
<BR>
reportage? Could there possibly be more crimes in Germany that are not
<BR>
being reported?
