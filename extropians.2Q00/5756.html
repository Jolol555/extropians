<EM>&gt; Though I have a list of the crimes per state and per city (for the bigger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ones) I lack a corresponding list with the gun control laws so I could do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this comparison. But I'm sure something like that can be found on the net.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is indeed a big problem of comparing the two continents. Anyway, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social differences are big and so I doubt that we would get to good results
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using this method. But as I would like to present this to my course, could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you perhaps give me your source of data or a hint where I can find facts to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prove your theory?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I recommend you go to www.guncite.com, which is an excellent resource on
<BR>
gun stats and references...

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, there's a word: I trust only in the statistics I have falsified
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself. I have studied political economics before switching to law, and my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statistics teacher began his second course with the book &quot;How to lie with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statistics&quot;. It was very, very interesting to see how this can work. As most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people do not understand this, they put a blind trust in anything that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shown with numbers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, this is why I recommend John Lott's book &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot;,
<BR>
because he studied all FBI crime stats from 1979 to 1995. The next
<BR>
largest study done by anyone else on geographic areas was a cherry
<BR>
picked study done by an anti-gun researcher of five different counties
<BR>
at five different period where numbers were selected so as to give the
<BR>
desired result.
