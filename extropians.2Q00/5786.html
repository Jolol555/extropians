<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Anyway, this discussion might prove quite valuable for me, as we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have a hot discussion on this at University. In Germany, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Anti-Gun faction is very strong and believes in the theory that no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guns results in no gun-related crimes. I tried pointing out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different but it seems that this is quite a &quot;belief&quot; rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something rational. As a matter of fact, I am neither pro-gun nor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anti-gun, because I do not have enough information to decide on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this. One of the key arguments that struck me was the fact, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is usually non-libertarian countries who forbid guns. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Communists and the Nazi are but two excellent examples of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political systems who had a great interest in disarming their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people.
</EM><BR>
<P>In this country we call them democrats.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Though I have a list of the crimes per state and per city (for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bigger ones) I lack a corresponding list with the gun control laws
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so I could do this comparison. But I'm sure something like that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can be found on the net. It is indeed a big problem of comparing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the two continents. Anyway, the social differences are big and so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I doubt that we would get to good results using this method. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as I would like to present this to my course, could you perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;give me your source of data or a hint where I can find facts to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prove your theory?
</EM><BR>
<P>You might want to start with Chicago. Handguns are completely
<BR>
illegal here (unless your a member of the city council)and have
<BR>
been since 1982, yet there are 1-3 murders a day here, not counting
<BR>
other types of crime commited with handguns. The surrounding
<BR>
suburbs where handgun ownership is legal and the gunshops are
<BR>
actually located have no such problems.
<BR>
<P>Illinois requires a license to own a handgun (picture I.D based
<BR>
FOID card) and we have 1 day waiting periods for longguns, 3 days
<BR>
for handguns, that is if you pass the instacheck system.
<BR>
<P>May I suggest www.nraila.org for more info.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Well, there's a word: I trust only in the statistics I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;falsified myself. I have studied political economics before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;switching to law, and my statistics teacher began his second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;course with the book &quot;How to lie with statistics&quot;. It was very,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very interesting to see how this can work. As most people do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;understand this, they put a blind trust in anything that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shown with numbers.
</EM><BR>
<P>We don't have a problem with the truth, the other side does.
