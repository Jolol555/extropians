<EM>&gt; &gt; before any of the storyline), that Neo would have to choose between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Morpheus' life and his own, that he would knock over the vase... yes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm willing to agree on 'sufficiently advanced technology'. But I just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prefer to do it differently, thanks.

<EM>&gt; Since all three were intimately jacked into the network, its pretty safe to assume that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Oracle had a pretty good pulse on the three to a much further extent than they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aware of themselves. Maybe Trinity has a groupie psychology, is looking for a savior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figure, and the Oracle could see that, and used her by telling her that Neo would be that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; savior. The interesting thing about prophesy is that people who beleive in prophesy tend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to make realty move to conform with that prophesy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Remember, the vase was in virtual reality, though even in regular reality, its not hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to hypnotize someone into doing exactly what you tell them to do so long as it isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something they had no objection to anyways. Talk is a very powerful tool, its why women
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prefer romance novels, they are easier to hypnotize as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your suggestion is consistent - as I said, I agree - but I'm just not
<BR>
entirely sure how well it will integrate into the rest of the scenario
<BR>
as I have it at the moment.
<BR>
<P>Although I must admit you've made me reconsider the Oracle aspect - I
<BR>
do see a couple of ways I can work something like this in, and one of
<BR>
them is quite interesting indeed...
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the input.
