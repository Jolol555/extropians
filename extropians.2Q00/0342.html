<EM>&gt; An especially worrying aspect of this (dominant?) American mind-set became
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparent to us in Oz a few weeks back, when we learned that the NRA were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TV-broadcasting ads that straight-out lied through their teeth about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allegedly vile consequences of gun buy-back laws here. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The claims were that we'd gone to the dogs, people were cowering from an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasing assault by armed crimes, blah blah. In fact, official crime data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showed that things had *improved* in all the salient parameters, as one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would expect. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Aha!  Ads, probably similar to those you are discussing, with &quot;documentation&quot;
<BR>
from the Australian situation (showing dozens of guns being destroyed, people
<BR>
claiming how they now felt unsafe without their weapons, etc.) *IS*
<BR>
being shown in the U.S. on late night TV during the junk advertising
<BR>
hours.  [Does it help the NRA to be slotted before or after the
<BR>
&quot;Thighmaster&quot; promo I wonder...]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The NRA falsified their statistics in the most blatant fashion. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conservative Aussie govt was so outraged that they threatened to take legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action against the NRA, a step I found astonishing for a right-wing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government. I don't know if news of all this reached the States, or just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the paid lies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting, I wonder if the U.S. gov. would do the same if the Australian
<BR>
govmt. showed the ads to be patently misleading.  It isn't clear whether
<BR>
this would be &quot;advertising&quot;, subject to false claims regulations or
<BR>
&quot;reporting&quot;, where a great deal of &quot;spin&quot; is allowed.
<BR>
<P>Note ahead of time, I will not respond to any additional posts on
<BR>
this subject.  The people who feel compelled to defend the actions
<BR>
of the NRA may do so, with the self-satisfaction of knowing they
<BR>
have defended their umbrella organization and had the &quot;last word&quot;.
<BR>
People who read this list, know me well enough to know I could
<BR>
disect anything said and point out any flaws in future arguments,
<BR>
however for the sake of preserving some small measure of sanity
<BR>
on the list, *I will not do so*.
<BR>
<P>I believe in the freedom to keep and bear *safe* arms, just
<BR>
as I believe that the goverment &quot;dunning&quot; people who don't
<BR>
wear their seatbelt is a *rational* approach to the problem
<BR>
of people who indirectly impose additional health care costs
<BR>
on society (through group insurance).  With freedom comes
<BR>
responsibility.
