<P>
Over the past few days we have had an ongoing debate
<BR>
on national missile defence.  This debate had two dimensions,
<BR>
the technical [can it be done] and the political [should it be
<BR>
done].  I learned today that the technical side of this debate
<BR>
might soon have a lot of new information released, some
<BR>
time in the next 3 to 8 weeks.  We are among friends here;
<BR>
I do not want to encourage anyone to post anything that
<BR>
might make them feel silly.  I therefore propose we focus our
<BR>
attention on the political side of the debate until we see what
<BR>
info the censors will allow to be released.  spike
<BR>
<P>Heres something that came out on the Post today:
<BR>
<P>BOEING PLANS MISSILE DEFENSE AD CAMPAIGN:
<BR>
With the planned multibillion-dollar national missile-defense
<BR>
system under attack from critics who say the technology will
<BR>
not work, Boeing Co. is about to break an industry silence
<BR>
with an advertising and &quot;education&quot; campaign aimed at both
<BR>
the public and insiders who influence Congress. &quot;We're going
<BR>
to be running some ads very soon, and we've had some discussions
<BR>
with the customer [the Pentagon] on how we can go out and try
<BR>
to educate a lot of folks about national missile defense. We're
<BR>
proud of the program that we have,&quot; James Albaugh, president
<BR>
of Boeing's Space and Communications Group, said in an interview
<BR>
yesterday. The pending campaign marks a departure not only
<BR>
for Boeing but also for the defense industry as a whole, which
<BR>
customarily leads the way in promoting and marketing major
<BR>
weapons systems. Although ballistic-missile defense will be worth
<BR>
about $4.7 billion in the next year alone, military contractors have
<BR>
done virtually no advertising and little direct lobbying on the issue
<BR>
in recent years, in part because congressional support seemed
<BR>
solid. Companies such as Lockheed Martin Corp., which is building
<BR>
an anti-missile system to protect Army troops, as well as subcontractors
<BR>
Raytheon Co. and TRW Inc., also were leery about taking a high
<BR>
profile on such a sensitive issue. (Washington Post)
