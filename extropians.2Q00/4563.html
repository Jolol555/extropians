From: &quot;altamira&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:altamira@ecpi.com?Subject=Re:%20Investing&In-Reply-To=&lt;200006071737.KAA10472@well.com&gt;">altamira@ecpi.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I used to believe strongly in saving and investing.  At one point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in my life I had a pretty impressive net worth.  Then in the late
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;80's two things happened to depress the Texas economy:  there was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;legislation which radically altered the federal tax treatment of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;real estate, which caused real estate prices to plummet; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around the same time, the price of oil fell dramatically, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also had a depressing effect on the Texas economy. Suddenly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who'd been good risks (financially) couldn't pay their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bills.  Even if you'd made secured loans, your collateral would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;often be tied up in bankruptcy estates. My business went belly-up,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and many of my investments lost half or more of their value.
</EM><BR>
<P>Lets not confuse investing in real estate with investing. Despite
<BR>
13+ corrections of 30% or more and 35+ corrections of 10% or more
<BR>
the stock market has averaged an 11% average yield for over 75
<BR>
years.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;The situation in Texas in the late 80's was just a minor glitch,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but living through it has helped me to extend my imagination to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;visualize more extensive economic depressions. Saving money for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;particular expenditure, such as starting or expanding a business,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;buying a house, etc. makes quite a lot of sense to me.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;investing just for the sake of investing doesn't, unless you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;appraoch it like playing a game, for the fun of it. (An exception
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to this would be if you have inside information about a company or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;companies you're investing in.)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If your goal is to have money to live on when you retire or to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self-insure for medical expenses, the best investment over the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long term is probably to hold relatively short-term low-risk bonds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;until they mature. When they mature, use the proceeds to purchase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more of the same.  Because the bonds are low risk, they'll also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;carry low interest rates, but there's a high probability that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;money will be there when you need it.  Because they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;short term, you can hold them to maturity without suffering damage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from inflation.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would argue that short term low risk bonds are only appropriate
<BR>
for short term surpluses you might have.
<BR>
<P>A good place to read about this in depth is at www.fool.com, and go
<BR>
to Fool (not fool) school.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My opinion is that the net economic effect of the stock market is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;destructive for some of the same reasons socialist economies don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work well.  I'm waiting for permission from a friend to quote a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;piece she wrote about the stock market.
</EM><BR>
<P>Read the piece, didn't agree with it at all, but your milage may
<BR>
vary.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps someone in the know here could comment, but I don't believe
<BR>
banks are allowed to invest in the stock market directly. Most of
<BR>
your money shouldn't be in banks anyway.
<BR>
<P>See Fool School for details.....
