<EM> &gt; I don't see it as either a monoculture or a single controlling entity.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Rather, there only has to be a consensus that replication is disastrous
</EM><BR>
<P>Consensus on a (potentially very large and heterogenous) group of beings?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; and must be prevented.  As long as the bulk of the power is held by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; agents with those views, replication by the others can be held in check.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Let's say we want to impose an autoreplication ban on all nonhuman
<BR>
agents in the entire ecosphere. Now. Impossible? Sure. Given nano, you 
<BR>
can handle biology. But can you handle nano given nano? I don't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt;  &gt; is viewed as a threat and is prevented.  Some entities would like to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;  &gt; replicate, but they cannot.  Most do not want to replicate, and attempt
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;  &gt; to prevent others from doing so.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; A mechanism? Both for action, and how an evolutionary regime can be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; stripped? 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Well, my first cut at the problem is that the majority would say that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; they would clobber those who reproduce without constraint.
</EM><BR>
<P>The majority needs not only to agree, but also to enforce. I don't see
<BR>
how a global replication ban on systems of all complexity scales can
<BR>
be prevented. How to tell legitimate replication (failures will still
<BR>
happen) from illegitimate ones? Extremely brittle architectures? But
<BR>
how to get there (fashistiod control) from here (multimodal
<BR>
diversity)?
<BR>
<P>Displaying the (meta)stability of an idealized state does not show
<BR>
feasibility, if there is no traversible path from here to there.
