<EM>&gt;the most money may be made by attention-intensive momentum trading

<P>I'm not a fan of thestreet.com, though I certainly see nothing wrong with 
<BR>
some judicious momentum investing. I've used it to good effect. However, I 
<BR>
think using it successfully requires using stock screens and fixed holding 
<BR>
periods that (a) select high quality companies with stock price momentum, 
<BR>
and (b) take emotion out of the decision-making process. I've found The 
<BR>
Motley Fool's Foolish Workshop an excellent resource on careful momentum 
<BR>
investing. In a recent round of backtesting, the RS-Overlap screen came out 
<BR>
looking very strong. I've also used the Screen of Screens to pick stocks 
<BR>
that rank high on several of the screens at once. (My last purchase using 
<BR>
that method was PMC-Sierra.)
<BR>
<P>Apart from TMF's Foolish Workshop and their Mechanical Investing board, Jon 
<BR>
Markman's Supermodel's column at MSN Investor is interesting. I'm not he 
<BR>
has backtested his screens so thoroughly, and his model portfolios are 
<BR>
incredibly volatile, but have mostly done extremely well.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly, some of the momentum screens identified in TMF's Workshop 
<BR>
actually held up quite well in a bear market. One thing I enjoy about 
<BR>
momentum/relative strength investing is that it frequently picks out 
<BR>
companies working on exceedingly cool technology that's taking off very 
<BR>
fast. What's really nice is when fundamental analysis leads you to pick 
<BR>
good companies that later show up on the momentum screens. That's happened 
<BR>
to me with i2 Technologies and JDS Uniphase.
