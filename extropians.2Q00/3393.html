<P>I honestly don't see how you could have interpreted my comments as
<BR>
non-materialist.  Perhaps I wasn't sufficiently clear.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;it has been long conceded that if one reproduces atom-for-atom the mass of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;flesh that is me, each reproduction will behave and feel exactly as I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;now--there is nothing &quot;magical&quot; about me that isn't contained wholly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;within my arrangement of atoms (and perhaps their quantum states, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are also theoretically reproducible).
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, with some reservation about quantum states, only because I don't
<BR>
know enough about the subject.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The conept of &quot;original&quot; in this scenario is only of interest to legal and
</EM><BR>
moral (and possibly religious) arguments.
<BR>
<P>You're right.  I did not mean to suggest that one of the post-split selves
<BR>
had some kind of metaphysically better claim to being the &quot;original.&quot;
<BR>
That's not my concern at all.  My concern is a person's most reasonable
<BR>
expectation pre-split, as it would factor into an economic calculation of
<BR>
whether to undergo a split.
<BR>
<P>Here's what we have: TWO post-split selves, each of whom experiences full
<BR>
continuity of self-awareness with the ONE pre-split self.  Say you're the
<BR>
pre-split self.  Suppose that tomorrow, just after the split, one of the
<BR>
post-split selves will be tortured, and the other will be given n dollars.
<BR>
You're sitting here, pre-split, thinking, &quot;What am I going to experience
<BR>
tomorrow?&quot;  If you claimed that you'd experience both, *that* would be a
<BR>
non-materialist position, since you'd be talking about a single
<BR>
self-awareness spanning two seperate brains, each of which is materially
<BR>
the same as the normal human brain that you started with.  So, as a good
<BR>
materialist, you'll expect to experience either the torture or the profit,
<BR>
but not both.  You won't know which one, though, because (as you pointed
<BR>
out) we cannot distinguish between the two post-split selves on the basis
<BR>
of their subjective relationship to the original.  So given that, what do
<BR>
you suggest as a more plausible pre-split expectation than what I suggested
<BR>
earlier: equal odds of continuing into each of the post-split selves?
