<EM>&gt;From: Spike Jones &lt;<A HREF="mailto:spike66@ibm.net?Subject=Re:%20Our%20friend%20Sasha%20Chislenko%20is%20dead&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000510073845.87748.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">spike66@ibm.net</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;With the devastating news of Sasha's passing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all our goofing and flame throwing takes on a stark
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;emptiness and meaninglessness.  For the next week
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or so, before we hit the send button, perhaps we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should think of Sasha and ask ourselves: should this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;post be our last in the archives, would we still hit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that send button?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>I never met Sasha and never even corresponded with him directly.  I was 
<BR>
touched however by the obviously heartfelt words posted today by those who 
<BR>
knew and loved him and I did &quot;pay my respects&quot; by visiting his web site.  I 
<BR>
was informed, amused and touched by a melancholy sadness that I will never 
<BR>
have the chance to meet this, by all accounts, remarkable person.
<BR>
<P>This also started me thinking about some less than kind words I have posted 
<BR>
in the past.  I began to wonder, if I died would I want those words to serve 
<BR>
as part of my remembrance?  Even worse, if the object of those words had 
<BR>
passed, would I want her/his last memory of me to be some tounge-in-cheek ad 
<BR>
hominem attack?  For me, the answer to both questions was a resounding &quot;no.&quot;
<BR>
<P>In honor of Mr. Chislenko, I would like to take this opportunity to 
<BR>
categorically apologize to all who may have been offended or annoyed by any 
<BR>
of my posts to this list.  The ideas I discussed were heartfelt, but the 
<BR>
tone (I admit) could have been more conciliatory.  And for this I apologize. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I also extend the &quot;olive branch&quot; to those who may feel animosity toward me 
<BR>
for any of my posts and, in honor of Sasha, I promise to do better.
<BR>
<P>Your friend,
<BR>
<P>-Zero
