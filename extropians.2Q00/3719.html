<EM>&gt; &gt; Who owns the roads???  Whoever provides the roads sets the policy re
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; insurance - or can if they choose, and they probably will, as otherwise they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; might either find themselves stuck in ligigation or without customers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are a number of different roles in this case, the drivers, the road
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; owners, the car owners, and the insurers of the drivers, roads and cars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Each insurer sets its own policy, of course. But I think KPJ was asking what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happens in case where there are incompatible policies. One extreme example
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be if a driver who has no insurance at all is responsible for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; substantial amount of damage (way above what he can compensate for).
</EM><BR>
<P>Most people have clauses on their policies to cover in the event of an uninsured
<BR>
motorist. Here in NH its quite typical, because you are not legally required to have
<BR>
car insurance unless you've been in an accident with x amount of damage before, been
<BR>
busted for DWI. Otherwise, insurance is usually mandated by the institution that
<BR>
finances your vehicle purchase. If you paid cash for your car, and you have a clean
<BR>
record, you have no legal obligation to be insured. Because of this, uninsured
<BR>
motorist clauses are common, though I imagine they might not be in regions with no
<BR>
states that have laws similar to ours.
<BR>
<P>The situation here in NH is much as I would expect in a libertarian society, where
<BR>
those that are insured would have clauses on their policies to cover in the event of
<BR>
an incident of some sort with an uninsured entity. I'm sure that in such a
<BR>
situation, like an accident the uninsured driver cannot pay for, you would wind up
<BR>
with the cost being financed, and a lein put on the future earnings of the
<BR>
individual. Such leins would be part of the credit record of the individual, and
<BR>
employers with their own insurance policies would be obligated by their insurance
<BR>
company to comply with garnishment orders.
<BR>
<P>Any accidents where the damage exceeded the ability of an uninsured individual to
<BR>
pay for in their lifetime would likely be the sort of accidents that insurance
<BR>
companies would pay to research ways of minimizing with new technologies.
