<P>
[[ I forward here a post I made in a private mailing list of my friends in 
<BR>
response to an essay by a friend who was chiding another poster about his 
<BR>
incautious use of the word &quot;fascist&quot; -- which has come up here -- and my use 
<BR>
of the word &quot;luddite&quot;.  ]]
<BR>
<P>I largely agree with what you've written here, Frank.  I certainly agree 
<BR>
about the word &quot;fascist&quot; - as I've echoed your sentiments before, I think we 
<BR>
dilute the power of the word by applying it to the petty tyrannies people 
<BR>
impose on each other in our society.  On the other hand, let me speak for a 
<BR>
moment in favor of my continued use of the word &quot;luddite&quot;.
<BR>
<P>First, &quot;luddite&quot; hasn't become encrusted with the kinds of connotations that 
<BR>
the bloodbath of the middle of the 20th century placed on the word &quot;fascist&quot;. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Yes, the word has just recently been resurrected, really, to apply to 
<BR>
developing attitudes about the new technological revolution we are 
<BR>
experiencing, intentionally to invoke the context of the first Luddites.  But 
<BR>
the historical distance from that first use of the word may allow us to 
<BR>
recapture it and recast it in the new context.
<BR>
<P>Second, even in the most extreme use of the word, &quot;luddite&quot; does have 
<BR>
legitimate objects in our current historical context.  Ted Kascinski is a 
<BR>
luddite.  Although he isn't nearly so frightening to most people, Jeremy 
<BR>
Rifkin is a luddite.  Prince Charles is a luddite.  And, showing why I think 
<BR>
it's necessary to be able to use the word more broadly, we see someone like 
<BR>
Bill Joy quoting Kascinski WITH APPROVAL in the mass media.
<BR>
<P>There will always be a struggle between those who would curtail individual 
<BR>
liberty and those who defend it.  Today, very few of the opponents of liberty 
<BR>
deserve the appellation of &quot;fascist&quot;, not least of which because the 
<BR>
struggles against Hitler and Mussolini and Tojo made the choice between 
<BR>
liberty and tyranny and the consequences of that choice so clear.  
<BR>
<P>But there is also a struggle going on regarding technology.  People like 
<BR>
Virginia Postrel and Max More and Eric Drexler and Ray Kurzweil have begun to 
<BR>
really throw some light on it with their work.  But we haven't yet come to 
<BR>
the watershed of history in that struggle.  The battle lines haven't been 
<BR>
drawn the way they were in the 1930s.  But they will be - make no mistake.   
<BR>
I hope no &quot;ultimate conflict&quot; over technology will be necessary, the way 
<BR>
things worked out with fascism.  I hope reason will win out over superstition 
<BR>
and fear.  But as the policy debate begins to take shape and turn into real 
<BR>
political conflict, I think there's a real use for strong words.  Strong 
<BR>
words serve as bright lights, when used judiciously.  And we'll need plenty 
<BR>
of light as we enter into the rough water ahead.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;
