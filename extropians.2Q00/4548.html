Washington - Two studies published on Friday confirm that nature makes the
<BR>
man, and that sex-reassignment surgery for boys born with deformed sex
<BR>
organs is misguided and possibly cruel.
<BR>
<P>The studies of 25 genetically male children raised as girls because of
<BR>
genital deformities showed all of them retained strong male
<BR>
characteristics, despite hormone and other treatments.
<BR>
Most reassigned themselves to be males when they got older, the
<BR>
researchers at Johns Hopkins University said.
<BR>
<P>&amp;quot;These studies suggest that male gender identity is directly related to
<BR>
normal male patterns of male hormone exposure in utero (in the womb),&amp;quot; Dr
<BR>
William Reiner, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and urologist who
<BR>
worked on both studies, said in a statement.
<BR>
<P>&amp;quot;These children demonstrate that normal male gender identity can develop
<BR>
not only in the absence of the penis, but even after the removal of
<BR>
testicles or castration at birth, and unequivocal rearing as female,&amp;quot; he
<BR>
added.
<BR>
<P>&amp;quot;Rather than the environment forming these children's gender identity,
<BR>
their identity and gender role seem to have developed despite a total
<BR>
environment telling them they were female.&amp;quot;
<BR>
<P>The issue has been prominent lately with the publication of a book, As
<BR>
Nature Made Him, by journalist John &lt;B&gt;Colapinto&lt;/B&gt;, which chronicles the
<BR>
case
<BR>
of Bruce Thiessen.
<BR>
<P>Thiessen had his genitals mutilated during a botched circumcision and his
<BR>
parents were convinced to raise him as a girl. The experiment failed, as
<BR>
Thiessen rebelled against becoming &amp;quot;Brenda.&amp;quot;
<BR>
<P>Reiner's team followed 27 genetically male children, with normal XY male
<BR>
chromosomes, who had cloacal exstrophy, a rare defect in which the boy has
<BR>
no penis but normal testicles.
<BR>
Twenty-five of the children were castrated and raised as females.
<BR>
<P>In the first study, Reiner's team followed 14 children, 12 of whom were
<BR>
raised as females.
<BR>
<P>They told a meeting of pediatricians in Boston that the 12 are strongly
<BR>
&amp;quot;male-typical&amp;quot; in choosing friends, activities and play, and that
<BR>
six of
<BR>
them decided to become boys again between the ages of 5 and 12.
<BR>
<P>The two who were allowed to stay males were developmentally far more like
<BR>
their normal male peers and psychologically better adjusted than those
<BR>
raised as girls, Reiner said.
<BR>
<P>A second study of 12 children given sex-reassignment surgery showed that
<BR>
eight had since decided to live as boys and that all the rest of the
<BR>
parents expected their children to switch back to a male gender when they
<BR>
learn they were born as boys.
<BR>
<P>&amp;quot;These studies indicate that with time and age, children may well know
<BR>
what their gender is, regardless of any and all information and
<BR>
child-rearing to the contrary,&amp;quot; Reiner said.
<BR>
<P>&amp;quot;They seem to be quite capable of telling us who they are, and we can
<BR>
observe how they act and function even before they can tell us.&amp;quot;
