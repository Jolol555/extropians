<EM>&gt; And no, I don't want to be a hero.  I think it loses some of the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point if you're a hero.  I'm not making a permanent moral commitment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which, if abandoned or altered, would mean that I'd betrayed everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a Singularitarian should stand for.  Once you become a hero, then PR
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forces you to never re-evaluate your own choices.  And there's also a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sort of gloating involved, where, even if you *say* you refuse to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comment on the choices of others - well, obviously, they're still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *wrong*, right?  Even if you're too *wise* and *tolerant* to call anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else on it?
</EM><BR>
<P>No...a hero who makes mistakes is still a hero.  You have to be able to
<BR>
state clearly why you were mistaken, and not change course *too* often,
<BR>
but if you gain a reputation for being able to find out when you're
<BR>
wrong before too much has happened, that may in fact increase the trust
<BR>
people place in you.  (I am speaking from personal experience here, at
<BR>
least the experience of having been treated as such.)
<BR>
<P>And perhaps that is the kind of role model we could be, leading by
<BR>
example so as to encourage others to be like us?
