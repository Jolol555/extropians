<EM>&gt; Well, the answer is obvious: one consciousness stream might not be aware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of another similar consciousness stream, but &quot;you&quot; (the collective bounded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the predicate &quot;is Harvey Newstrom&quot;) are necessarily aware of all of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;you&quot; simultaneously.  You(1) are aware of you(1), you(2) are aware of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you(2), so some member of you is aware of you(1), and some member of you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is aware of you(2).  So &quot;you&quot; are aware of all of you, even on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;adjective&quot; view.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is where it becomes completely UNobvious to me.  You can define the
<BR>
self anyway you like, but my definition is the self-aware consciousness who
<BR>
says &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;.  Any thoughts being generated which are not
<BR>
accessible by me are not my thoughts and are not coming from me.  Maybe my
<BR>
desire for an exact copy is so rigid that I refuse to trust even an exact
<BR>
copy to follow my will.  I can't imagine thinking that an external brain
<BR>
that is thinking thoughts I cannot detect is really me.  I can't imagine
<BR>
thinking that the internal brain that is currently writing these words can
<BR>
be deleted, because it is no longer me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you can't feel your hand, does that mean the hand isn't part of you?
</EM><BR>
<P>The hand is not part of my consciousness.  It indeed can be deleted without
<BR>
killing me. It is my consiousness that I do not want deleted.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I take it as axiomatic that our goals, our ends, are what we are
</EM><BR>
striving
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; for; that the correct goals/ends are the correct things to strive for.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; With that in mind, do we have it as a goal to preserve our current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness stream?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ahem.  You have it as a goal to preserve your &quot;self,&quot; but you have chosen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to define &quot;self&quot; as consciousness stream.  I'm arguing that this was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mistake, that you'd be better served with another definition.
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  I do not choose to preserve my self no matter what that self turns out
<BR>
to be.  I choose to preserve my current consciousness stream.  I think you
<BR>
believe that I am trying to preserve my &quot;self&quot; but have a mistaken belief of
<BR>
what that is.  My goal is to continue my current consciousness stream.  Even
<BR>
if evolution, growth or other events define it to no longer be &quot;me&quot;, that is
<BR>
what I choose to preserve.  I would even prefer to have my memory wiped and
<BR>
my consciousness continue rather than delete this consciousness and create a
<BR>
new one with all my memories.  I would like to preserve my memories, but my
<BR>
definition of life is not based on the past.  It is based on the future.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yet, I posit, you just might die for your brother given a pretty good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason.  And he just might die for you.  This should be a hint to you to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probe your intuitions further on this matter: if these desires are coming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from your primitive imperatives, then, as far as I can tell, the primitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imperatives are not only willing to make exceptions for exact copies, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also exceptions for someone who shares only your genes.  (Or even just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; half your genes, in the case of your children.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Genetics have little value to me.  I think people are too carried away in
<BR>
trying to preserve their DNA.  If I could be uploaded into a robot without
<BR>
DNA, that would be great.  My decision to die for my brother would be based
<BR>
on life-long familiarity with him.  I am familiar with my friends and my
<BR>
current consciousness stream as well.  I would not be as likely to die for a
<BR>
brother I never knew existed or a clone I had never previously met or a copy
<BR>
who wanted to replace me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Look, it's not like we can perform an experiment to check and see if a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copy is &quot;really me&quot; or not.  This is a matter of definition, it's a matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we have to decide for ourselves on the basis of our other beliefs and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desires.  I take it that the most you can say on this point is that my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definition doesn't jive with your goals, not that my definition doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; line up with reality.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right.  This is the important new agreement that I have not seen in previous
<BR>
incarnations of this thread.  We each have different goals.  We are not all
<BR>
trying to save the same thing, with technical disagreements on how to go
<BR>
about it.  We each actually value different aspect of living which have
<BR>
never been divisible before.  Now that we can mix and match pieces of life
<BR>
in different new combinations, we find that different people are choosing
<BR>
different aspects of &quot;being alive.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Some people would require a perfect memory from their previous body, or they
<BR>
would consider themselves dead.  Some people would require the same body, or
<BR>
they would consider themselves dead.  Some people would require physical
<BR>
sensations and/or qualia or they would consider themselves dead.  Some
<BR>
people would require a continued consciousness stream.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But if it doesn't jive with your goals, with which goals does it conflict?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've already made the case that it doesn't conflict with your desire for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;self&quot; preservation, whatever &quot;self&quot; turns out to be. Rather, instead, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only seems to conflict with your goal to preserve consciousness streams.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And as far as I can tell, you adopted that position because you took it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that this was the only way to preserve your &quot;self&quot;.  I'm arguing that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not the case, that you can preserve yourself while stunting your own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conciousness streams.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, wrong.  I don't like my self.  I think it should be better.  The body
<BR>
should be upgraded.  The brain should be faster.  The thoughts should be
<BR>
more advanced.  The activities should be god-like.  This is transhumanism.
<BR>
I want to evolve so far that I no longer bear much resemblance to my current
<BR>
self.  I have no desire to preserve anything of myself now, just as I don't
<BR>
miss any features missing from feotus-Harvey who no longer exists.  I do
<BR>
want to extend my current consciousness stream so that I am around to
<BR>
experience the god-like Harvey.  If that stream ends, then I miss out on the
<BR>
show.
<BR>
<P>I really do want to preserve my current consciousness stream.  I really
<BR>
don't care about preserving any portions of my &quot;self&quot;.
