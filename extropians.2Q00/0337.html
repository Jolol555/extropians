<EM>&gt; Mike, you can't imagine how wildly weird this sort of thing sounds in Oz.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How pathologically dangerous the society must have become to permit a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rational man like yourself to regard such fears as natural and attitudes as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; righteous. 
</EM><BR>
<P>That's amazing; such views are very common in the US.  Is it the basic
<BR>
notion that someone might try to defend himself that seems wildly weird?
<BR>
Or is it specific to the use of guns?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; An especially worrying aspect of this (dominant?) American mind-set became
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparent to us in Oz a few weeks back, when we learned that the NRA were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TV-broadcasting ads that straight-out lied through their teeth about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allegedly vile consequences of gun buy-back laws here. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The claims were that we'd gone to the dogs, people were cowering from an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasing assault by armed crims, blah blah. In fact, official crime data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showed that things had *improved* in all the salient parameters, as one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would expect. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The NRA falsified their statistics in the most blatant fashion. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conservative Aussie govt was so outraged that they threatened to take legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action against the NRA, a step I found astonishing for a right-wing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government. I don't know if news of all this reached the States, or just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the paid lies.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have never gone to the NRA web site before, but a moment's searching
<BR>
found <A HREF="http://www.nraila.org/research/20000329-BanningGuns-001.shtml">http://www.nraila.org/research/20000329-BanningGuns-001.shtml</A>,
<BR>
which presents their version of this controversy.  I would be interested
<BR>
in hearing whether any of the claims there are falsified.
