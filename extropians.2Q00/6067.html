<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think Anders has crystallized the direction of behavior is an aptly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; positive light, but it's often easier to write down the words than to deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; head on with an adverse poster.  If Anders had to defend his reputation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how would he do it?  For example, if Anders was told something very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unbecoming about himself or his family, I don't even want to imagine, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something that could humiliate or hurt him professionally, would he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue politely to respond when the flamer wouldn't let up.  Or, would he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; walk away knowing that he did the best he could under the circumstances,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and better judgment told him to ignore the flamer.  I would never want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anders to experience such a thing, but it does build character -:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, despite the example Waldemar mentioned, I have not
<BR>
experienced any such situation yet, which I actually consider a bit of
<BR>
a drawback - I prefer to learn how to deal with smear campaigns before
<BR>
the stakes get too high.
<BR>
<P>Overall I consider myself a bit too conflict-aversive, indeed
<BR>
preferring to ignore flamers (this is also why I seldom feel up to
<BR>
date in the current flamewars on list, I simply mentally killfile
<BR>
them) rather than deal with them. A strategy that I think works on a
<BR>
mailing list, but would not work in a real world setting.
<BR>
<P>I better update my personality a bit with an optional defense
<BR>
subpersonality :-)
<BR>
<P>I deeply respect people who can remain controlled and balanced in the
<BR>
face of such attacks. I am for example amazed by how well Max and
<BR>
Natasha has handled the (sadly far too common and rude) personal
<BR>
attacks they have been subjected to. Perhaps the worst thing with the
<BR>
attacks is that they are so unsophisticated; there is nothing so
<BR>
embarrassing as unworthy enemies. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think that Bonnie touched on important issues also:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;What are the bad things that could happen if the Extropians didn't have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good reputation?  With whom must they try to maintain a good reputation?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Last night I was at a life extension summit and we were talking about all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the recent PR in the news about biotech, nano and cryonics, etc.  Someone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe me since I have a thang for culture, will write about the people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behind the ideas.  Robert Freitas (_NanoMedicine_) is a really cryo guy, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is Michael West (formerly with Geron) and others on this list, etc.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point being, there are so many interesting people in &quot;our&quot; culture and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is becoming more and more mainstream.  Since our ideas are disturbing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many people, it's best to present them in ways that are not threatening.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thus, a good reputation is beneficial.  Maintaining a good reputation with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each other (first), and then with the public would mean those who are our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colleagues, those who we do business with us, and those who interview us in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the media.
</EM><BR>
<P>Having a good reputation means that others are more likely to want to
<BR>
interact with you, listen to you or deal with you. Without it there is
<BR>
a good chance that nobody will listen to what you have to say, with it
<BR>
people are likely to take notice (even if your ideas are less than
<BR>
brilliant). There are of course different kinds of reputations:
<BR>
professional, academic, ethical, emotional, economic, ideological etc,
<BR>
and one can have a great reputation in one respect but a poor in
<BR>
another.
<BR>
<P>If extropians do not have a good reputation, a lot of opportunities
<BR>
will be lost and there is as I have said before a risk that other,
<BR>
inimical memesets will become dominant. I think there is a lot of work
<BR>
to do here. While extropianism is mentioned in the media from time to
<BR>
time, the references are usually referring to it as some kind of
<BR>
subculture, wild belief or a fad, not as a serious philosophy or
<BR>
movement. That ought to be changed, and the best way is to have
<BR>
interesting, knowledgeable and accessible people with good reputations
<BR>
in the address lists of journalists and other influential groups. This
<BR>
is not just an issue of having a few great spokespeople
<BR>
(spokesbeings?) doing all the talking, it recurses down to all of us -
<BR>
we are each a representative of extropianism with our own reputation
<BR>
among friends, coworkers, relatives and acquintances, and when we
<BR>
speak of our own specialities, whatever they are, we are the local
<BR>
(mini)experts.  This is a tremendous responsibility.  The local level
<BR>
is where much of the memetic groundwork has to be laid.
