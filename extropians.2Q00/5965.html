<EM>&gt; I find this thread mind-boggling. People like Corey and Anders are simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointing out that couching our aspirations as *rape*, however
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; metaphorically, is distasteful at best and wildly self-destructive at worst.
</EM><BR>
<P>While I don't think it is very productive to attempt to rehash what
<BR>
someone else meant, there is a larger issue here than just using words
<BR>
like &quot;rape&quot;.  (I agree that it is a poor word to use; in fact I think
<BR>
it is wrong to refer to the &quot;rape of the land&quot; in any context, as true
<BR>
rape is far more damaging than such figurative analogies.)
<BR>
<P>Corey originally wrote:
<BR>
<P>: &quot;Why live in a gravity well when you can disassemble the planets and 
<BR>
: distribute their mass...&quot;
<BR>
: 
<BR>
: &quot;You can't own real estate on Mars, but you can rape it for resources...&quot;
<BR>
: 
<BR>
: &quot;Pave the Universe&quot;
<BR>
: 
<BR>
: Even though these statements might be intended flippantly, sarcastically, or 
<BR>
: simply in poor taste, these are prime examples of the problems that the 
<BR>
: populace at large has with the radical futurist movements (of which 
<BR>
: transhumanism and extropianism are a part, fortunately or no) - the total
<BR>
: affront to what are accepted as aestheticaly pleasing to many people.
<BR>
: 
<BR>
: Consider the movement to ban forestry and strip mining.  &quot;Great claws and 
<BR>
: gouges ripped into the earth&quot;... &quot;Poisoned rivers running crimson like blood
<BR>
: from the mine openings&quot;... &quot;denuded hills, blasted into a seemingly post-
<BR>
: apocalyptic wasteland&quot;... And people are talking about disassembling entire 
<BR>
: PLANETS?  During the 70s and 80s there was ahuge industry involved in painting
<BR>
: beautiful and alien vistas based on data collected from astronauts on the 
<BR>
: moon and the various Voyager and Mariner probes.  
<BR>
<P>My understanding is that he is objecting to discussions of (for example)
<BR>
disassembling planets, no matter how we word it.  Certainly the first
<BR>
of the quotes that he offers is objective enough.  People are going to
<BR>
find this idea inherently objectionable.  I think Corey meant to suggest
<BR>
that we should avoid talking about our aspirations in these terms.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps I have misinterpreted Corey, and everyone agrees that there
<BR>
is no problem in what we talk about, as long as we avoid a few loaded
<BR>
words like &quot;rape&quot; and &quot;pave&quot;.  What exactly is the politically correct
<BR>
way to refer to turning Mars into a pile of rubble?  Should we claim to
<BR>
be liberating the oppressed (or at least pressurized) mass of the core?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We're going to have enough foes. Let's not gratuitously and foolishly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provide them with the stick to beat us.
</EM><BR>
<P>But let's have the courage to follow our ideas wherever they lead.
