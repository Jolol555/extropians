Phil Osborn spewed:
<BR>
<P>| Funny, most of the professional developers I have known over the years
<BR>
| consider MS/DOS - Windows to be an unbelievable kludge.
<BR>
<P>First of all, Windows on MS/DOS *was* a kludge, but that hasn't existed
<BR>
since 3.1.  All of MS' 32-bit operating systems are *actually* operating
<BR>
systems, the DOS infrastructure is *minimal*.  In NT and 2000 DOS is
<BR>
non-existent.
<BR>
<P>MS-oriented developers are the workhorse of the development community.
<BR>
Sure, talk to Java and C developers (I was one) and you'll hear a different
<BR>
viewpoint - inferiority complex.  With the advent of COM, there is not one
<BR>
real benefit to using even C++ over VB for app development (of course you
<BR>
get some performance benefit in some cases - solution, write a C++ COM
<BR>
object for those situations and call it from anywhere).  With VB or any
<BR>
derived tools (i.e. ASP), a developer can be 2-3 times as productive than
<BR>
with any of the aforementioned languages.  This is due in part to A) the
<BR>
APIs available to all of MS' products, which are as powerful, if not more
<BR>
so, than open source, B) the amazing cross-functional IDEs (Integrated
<BR>
Development Environments), and C) MS' excellent developer support network.
<BR>
<P>The problem here is that the dot-com &quot;revolution&quot; has validated
<BR>
hackers-gone-&quot;professional&quot;-developers who believe that nobly writing for
<BR>
open source software justifies constant troubleshooting and maintenance.
<BR>
When your burn rate is over $55,000/day, you cannot afford to write things
<BR>
more than once - and we don't.  The days of building amazingly complex
<BR>
scientific and enterprise applications on UNIX should be over.  There are
<BR>
better alternatives now.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about the
<BR>
| market itself?  It was specifically Bill Gates who pushed us into the
<BR>
| software marketing model that still prevails - where the software
<BR>
developer
<BR>
| gets a few pennies on the dollar
<BR>
<P>I'm not quite sure which developers you're talking about, but I am sure it's
<BR>
beside the point.  Microsoft's products help businesses succeed and
<BR>
consumers consume, what more can you ask for?
<BR>
<P>, while most of the money goes to marketing,
<BR>
| and the end-buyer really has little clue as to product suitability or
<BR>
| reliability.
<BR>
<P>Man - have you really spent a lot of time in X-Windows?   Suitability?  for
<BR>
the common Joe?  Come on.  I'd be suprised if you could install Linux on a
<BR>
new box and have XFree86 running in less than 5 attempts.
<BR>
<P>Read Steven Levy's &quot;Hackers.&quot;  We could have had a model more
<BR>
| like the LINUX - open-source, peer-reviewed system, where lousy software
<BR>
is
<BR>
| caught before it ever made it to the shelf, and the money mostly goes
<BR>
| directly to the creators, and solid products cost a fraction of the
<BR>
Windows
<BR>
| equivalent.
<BR>
|
<BR>
<P>How very ideal - wake up man.
