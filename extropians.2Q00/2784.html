<P><EM>&gt; No matter how maliciously we choose to wield our growing power over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature, we can never begin to approach in capriciousness and sheer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind-boggling indifference the actions displayed by nature herself.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to think of nature as doing all it can to eventually
<BR>
eliminate death, become compassionate to every living being..., given
<BR>
what it has to work with.  Like a proud parent, I think of it has
<BR>
being happy that it has finally successfully created beings
<BR>
intelligent and powerful enough to start making a difference in all
<BR>
this.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I do rail against are absurd ideas of supposed already
<BR>
powerful Gods, ETs, and so on and so forth that for whatever absurd
<BR>
evil justifying theodicy, whatever sickening &quot;prime directive&quot; don't
<BR>
come down and help us and nature to become caring, concerned, and able
<BR>
to do something to help all.  If there are already such beings out
<BR>
their hiding and you're listing, please screw your pious &quot;prime
<BR>
directives&quot; or whatever sick justifications of such &quot;capriciousness
<BR>
and sheer mind-boggling indifference&quot; natures you can come up with and
<BR>
please come down and give us all a hand before we lose anyone else
<BR>
whether they were less then or more than what Sasha was.
