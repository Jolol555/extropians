<EM>&gt; I have a feeling that one day in the future, we will consider capitol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; punishment just as barbaric as foreign countries see us now, (Europe seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to look down on our electric chair) or as we now view the guillotine. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acknowledge that I have extreme viewpoints towards hypocritical punishment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's our government &quot;we do not allow killing, it is wrong, so we will kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you&quot;. To me, (and I know not a lot will agree, here's where I throw in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disclaimer: people can use physical punishment towards their own children,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's their family, their business, and their choice, although I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chose not to&quot;) it is just as ironic as if I had a child (say Timmy), that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was hitting the neighbor kid , 'little Cindy' from down the street, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said &quot;Timmy it's wrong to hit other's&quot; and proceeded to hit him 'as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; punishment'. I know that not everyone will agree with this, but I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exact punishments, tend to escalate the action. If we kill murder's, does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this prevent any further murders?
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem Gina, is that the government has, statutorily, rather
<BR>
exacting standards as to who it can kill under what circumstances. Some
<BR>
of these circumstances are less exacting than what is required of
<BR>
civilians to kill, but more exacting in other circumstances, and
<BR>
sometimes these standards are not followed to the letter or even to the
<BR>
spirit. James is right to say that they should be held to no higher or
<BR>
lower a standard than average people are held to.
<BR>
<P>Frankly I don't give a hoot what the europeans think of us. We've bailed
<BR>
their asses out of situations that caused far more death and destruction
<BR>
than has ever happened here in total, so they are nobody to point
<BR>
fingers. They seem to think that any murder that isn't happening as part
<BR>
of a war or genocide is a crime against humanity, while if it happens
<BR>
inside one of those two contexts that nobody is responsible, that
<BR>
everyone 'was just following orders', which is a bullshit cop out.
<BR>
<P>The old 'thou shalt not kill' is a mis-interpretation of the old jewish
<BR>
ethic, which was originally 'thou shalt not murder'. There is a distinct
<BR>
difference between the two. As much as I like Nadia, I still think she's
<BR>
out to lunch to say that killing is murder no matter what. As James
<BR>
Halperin said in his _The Truth Machine_, &quot;some people need killing&quot;.
<BR>
Thats supposedly an old Texas defense for killing a criminal or other
<BR>
pox on society, and I agree with it. Some times to only way to improve
<BR>
the gene pool is to cull the herd.
<BR>
<P>Prof. John Lott has shown that the death penalty, as it is currently
<BR>
used as a legal punishment today, has shown little impact, positive or
<BR>
negative, against violent or other crime, mainly because it is imposed
<BR>
so rarely, and is so easy to delay and get out of. However, that the
<BR>
same statistics show that the threat of death at the crime scene by the
<BR>
targeted victim on the perpetrator has a measured impact on crime. The
<BR>
death penalty, issued at the crime scene by the victim to the
<BR>
perpetrator, does have a measurable impact on crime. Its also been shown
<BR>
that a 1% increase in legal concealed weapons carriers cause a 2%
<BR>
reduction in crime.
<BR>
<P>Little kids don't associate in the way you describe. They are always
<BR>
trying to find rationalizations for why what the did was right, and how
<BR>
they were wronged, but they DO respond to negative reinforcment.
<BR>
Excessive use of corporal punishment is detrimental, however rational,
<BR>
measured doses make sure the kids learn that the few rare times they are
<BR>
subjected to corporal punishment, they had really crossed the line.
<BR>
Imposing coporal punishment on your kids should be cases where 'this
<BR>
hurts me more that it hurts you', no matter how much your kids don't
<BR>
want to beleive it. I've found that many, if not most kids who had never
<BR>
been subjected to any corporal discipline in their lives were typically
<BR>
self centered, arrogant, demanding, spoiled brats, far into adulthood.
<BR>
<P>Funny thing is, Hitler didn't beleive in corporal punishment for kids.
<BR>
He was a vegetarian too...
