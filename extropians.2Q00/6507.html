Other piece of data:  farm animals are given low level of antibiotics on a
<BR>
constant basis.  Supposedly they grow faster when they aren't fighting off
<BR>
diseases.  One would hope that ranchers/farmers wouldn't be doing this if they
<BR>
couldn't measure the result.  One would presume, economically, that some
<BR>
farmer who didn't do this would make more profit than others, if there was no
<BR>
benefit, and that the practice would then not stay around.
<BR>
<P>Now, humans don't get low levels of antibiotics, and these are animals raised
<BR>
for slaughter, so we can't measure increases in life expectancy, and I have no
<BR>
references because I'm wasting time at work doing this.  But it's evidence
<BR>
that non-fatal infections, or even infections which might be noticed, have a
<BR>
cumulative effect on health.  Deaths from non-infectious proximate causes may
<BR>
have been accelerated by damage done by various diseases over the course of a
<BR>
person's lifetime.  Eliminating the wear and tear of those diseases could then
<BR>
extend health and, perhaps, life expectancy.
<BR>
<P>Let me also note that I'm open to the idea that spending at the current margin
<BR>
makes little difference in overall health, that cancer and heart treatments
<BR>
are of less significance to society than clean water and lots of concrete
<BR>
(insect control), and that the modern medical insurance mechanism encourages
<BR>
profligacy of spending.

<P>But the claim that the increase in First and Second World life expectancy has
<BR>
no known explanation, which Robin seems to be making, definitely hits the
<BR>
bogosity filter.
