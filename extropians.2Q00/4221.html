<P><EM> &gt; Anyway, what you are describing is not the kind of paradox people keep
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; going on about. It seems like whenever talk of FTL communications comes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; up, people start spouting off about the future, the past, paradoxes, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Just seems silly to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>The reason is that when you have FTL communication, you can reverse
<BR>
the order of cause and effect.
<BR>
<P>An &quot;event&quot; in special relativity specifies a position and a time.  The
<BR>
interval between two events A and B is called &quot;timelike&quot; if you can
<BR>
get from A to B going slower than the speed of light; &quot;spacelike&quot; if
<BR>
you would have to go faster than the speed of light; and &quot;lightlike&quot;
<BR>
if you would have to go at exactly the speed of light.
<BR>
<P>For timelike and lightlike intervals, absolute ordering is preserved in all
<BR>
reference frames; that is, if A happens before B in one frame, A will
<BR>
happen before B in all frames.
<BR>
<P>For spacelike intervals, that is not the case.  One person may see A
<BR>
happening before B; another person zipping by in a spaceship going
<BR>
another direction might see B happen before A.
<BR>
<P>Now if you can travel from A to B, or even transmit information from A
<BR>
to B, and A and B are spacelike-separated, you have a problem.  Send a
<BR>
signal from A to B, and some observers will see people at B receiving
<BR>
the signal (and acting on it) _before_ it was sent.
<BR>
<P>The book _Spacetime Physics_ by Taylor and Wheeler is probably a
<BR>
pretty good introduction to this stuff.
<BR>
<P>I think the experiment is just some kind of phase vs. group velocity
<BR>
confusion.  In a wave packet, individual Fourier components can travel
<BR>
faster than c (phase velocities), but they don't transmit any information.
<BR>
The whole packet has to travel at or below c (group velocity).

Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight.
