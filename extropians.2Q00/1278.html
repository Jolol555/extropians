<EM>&gt; &gt; One comedian had the best idea I have ever heard. Make inmates peddle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bikes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; all day and night to provide electricity for the whole nation. No one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; ever want to go back after ten years of that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Eh. I like it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, hard labor is not a bad alternative for this purpose. If the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; choice is between stocking shelves at the grocery store or breaking 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rocks in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prison, the guy who doesn't want to bother working has a clear incentive 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to become a criminal. I think you'd still want shorter sentences that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have now -- maybe 4-6 months of labor instead of a year of current-style
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; jail.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yeah but that's not the same. For one thing the bike/electricity idea 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;serves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to solve TWO problems at once,  Greenie conservationists AND Law and Order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Goons will like it. Criminals will be put to a higher purpose, instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;making things, they'll be like little power supplies....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Second, hard labor isn't new, the bike idea is.
</EM><BR>
<P>I often wonder, those mornings when I and a host of others are sweating like 
<BR>
crazy on various self-inflicted torture devices as treadmills, stationary 
<BR>
bikes, etc., how difficult it would be to translate all this wasted energy 
<BR>
into some sort of usable power.  And why no one has thought to do it.  Every 
<BR>
morning in my gym there are about 100 people pedaling, walking, and pumping 
<BR>
all those machines.  Does anyone here no whether it would be difficult to 
<BR>
translate any of that motion into usable power?
<BR>
<P>Burning up last night's lasagna is good enough reason for me to keep working 
<BR>
out, but I'd feel even better about it if I was contributing to the green 
<BR>
movement at the same time.
<BR>
