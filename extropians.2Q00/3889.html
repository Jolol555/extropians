I have seen references to a reluctance to discuss gun control because of 
<BR>
something happening on the list a while ago, but I don't know exactly what 
<BR>
happened or what the status of gun control discussion is. Someone want to 
<BR>
address this?
<BR>
I have found that most keyboards have a key which says &quot;delete&quot;, or 
<BR>
sometimes just &quot;del&quot;. On my keyboard it is to the right of the &quot;enter&quot; key, 
<BR>
in a group which contains such keys as &quot;end&quot; and &quot;home&quot;. I am using a QWERTY 
<BR>
keyboard. People using other types of keyboards may need to consult their 
<BR>
manual. Pressing this button will remove the offending message before having 
<BR>
to read it. It usually takes me about 1 second to carry out this action. 
<BR>
Other e-mail programs may have different means of removing messages before 
<BR>
having to read them. Consult your help file. Although I find it fairly easy 
<BR>
to guess a message's gun content by its topic, some may find it more 
<BR>
difficult. Maybe putting a &quot;GUNS:&quot; meta tag before any post having to do 
<BR>
with gun control could help.
<BR>
A less sarcastic suggestion on the &quot;topic&quot; issue: I remember reading that 
<BR>
some people are a little embarrassed when checking e-mail at work or with 
<BR>
parents around, which has a sexually explicit topic. I think this is a 
<BR>
legitimate complaint, and one which is relevant to me since I started 
<BR>
working in an office which is 90% Mormon. Rather then ask anyone to tone 
<BR>
down their discussion for my sake, I got a seperate e-mail account which I 
<BR>
have the mail from this list go to, and I only check it at home or when 
<BR>
nobody else is around.
