<EM>&gt;From: Alejandro Dubrovsky &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Alejandro.Dubrovsky@isholding.com?Subject=RE:%20Injustice&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000408052647.16195.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">Alejandro.Dubrovsky@isholding.com</A>&gt;&gt;Subject: RE:

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The debate over Elian is disgusting.  While I typed this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; message, around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; forty children died, thirty of them from starvation.  Militarily, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; least, we have more than enough strength to go into those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; countries and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; knock over the tinpot dictators.  We don't.  Why?  Because it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; upset the international teapot, give the US a big honkin'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; black mark in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the UN's book, make *big* dictatorships like China extremely nervous,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and up the probability of nuclear war by a few points.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Considering that the US setup and feeds half of those tinpot dictatorships,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it would also be rather self-defeating.  The US has proven many times that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it doesn't care what the UN thinks of its actions (i'm not saying this is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bad thing).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The thing that bothers me is that while you are in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Singularity-creation-mode, your moral objectivism is subdued by the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that you admit that you have no smidgin of an idea of what this objective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;moral code would be, but when you switch to analysis of everyday affairs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you forget about your ignorant condition and transform yourself into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;classical american asshole who thinks he knows what's best for the world 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how the US should go about making it so. but of course, you weren't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advocating a decision one way or the other.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;(Child of a tinpot dictatorship country partly setup, partly fed, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;partly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fucked by the US.  Of course, the natives did the rest)
</EM><BR>
<P>Not to defend the U.S. - being an anarchist, that would be quite a trick(!) 
<BR>
- but in comparison to China???  Consider the recent deliberately-leaked 
<BR>
scenario that one Chinese newspaper was reported to have published.  
<BR>
Allegedly, top military planners in China had worked out a strategy of using 
<BR>
neutron bombs to annihilate the population of Taiwan, then move in and take 
<BR>
over the hardware, etc.
<BR>
<P>They included their analysis of the U.S. response, which was that the U.S. 
<BR>
would never risk 100M dead in a nuclear exchange with China, so it could 
<BR>
safely be written off.  The implication, of course, is that they are 
<BR>
perfectly willing to gamble with 1.5 billion Chinese dead, and the utter 
<BR>
destruction for all time of 3,000 years of cultural heritage.  Something of 
<BR>
a moral distinction, that.  I don't think that even Hitler was quite as 
<BR>
psychopathic as the Chinese leadership.
