<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The only protection offered against illegitimate use of deadly force 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the U.S. is to kill the state agents/police at the time the incident
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;occurs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Murder is *already* a capital offense, even if you are wearing a cop 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;uniform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; at the time you commit the murder.  So I assume what you are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suggesting is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; some sort of summary execution which bypasses the jury trial process, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;   That sounds like a really great plan.  Oh, except for the minor 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;detail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that *no one in their right mind would become a cop*. I'm amazed that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; can hire people as cops now to get paid marginally well to risk their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; every working hour of the day.  And now, in addition to getting 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reprimanded,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; suspended, fired and sued for making an error, you think they should 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; *killed* too?  Yeah, sure I might take that job...if it paid $10 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;million a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; year.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No, it would make sure that cops make sure that their actions are legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;before they take them. When you are dealing with life or death issues,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;why does the life of an innocent law abiding civilian mean less than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone who has been condemned to death by a jury? You seem to think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that so long as the cops are doing their jobs and following orders, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can kill whoever they want with impunity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well from James' more recent post it seems that I had *him* wrong when I 
<BR>
suggested that he was espousing summary execution for cops who did bad 
<BR>
shootings.  He seems to understand the overarching impracticality of such an 
<BR>
extreme measure.  You, however, seem to think it would be a good thing.  So 
<BR>
I pose the question now to you - where in the world do you think you would 
<BR>
find people to take the job of a cop if a mistake in judgment would lead to 
<BR>
their summary execution?  How much do you think such brave souls would have 
<BR>
to be paid to take the job?
<BR>
<P>Granted, trigger-happy cops are a bad thing.  But are cops who are afraid to 
<BR>
shoot until *after* they are shot at necessarily a good thing?  My guess is 
<BR>
that that would only lead to a sharp increase in the number of cops killed 
<BR>
in the line of duty.  What you seem to suggest is a lose-lose situation for 
<BR>
the cops.  If they shoot first, and they have made a mistake, they are 
<BR>
executed.  If they don't shoot first, chances are they are executed by the 
<BR>
bad guys.  Given that set of circumstances, if I had to choose between being 
<BR>
a cop and a robber...&quot;stick 'em up buddy!&quot;
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
