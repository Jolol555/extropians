<EM>&gt; &gt; Just because I cannot predict the outcome of an experiment, is a

<EM>&gt; &gt; reason for caution.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That I could not tell the difference AFTER the experiment is no

<EM>&gt; &gt; guarantee that it worked the way I would have liked.

<P>&nbsp;(because it may be a &quot;different&quot; &quot;I&quot;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's not really an experiment if it gives you no information, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it?
</EM><BR>
<P>True. That's the problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You know the outcome beforehand.
</EM><BR>
<P>But the point is we don't. The bind is, if the technology makes a
<BR>
perfect physical copy AND you believe that a &quot;duplicate&quot; mind will
<BR>
necessarily be &quot;generated&quot; by the copy, you will have no way of
<BR>
checking (as an external observer), neither would the subject. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Like Mr Lorrey, I would like to believe in transporters, I'm just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sure I can.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How can you decide?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know. Neither does anybody else though, I suspect :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Suppose you lived in a world where everyone used them.  Would that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a difference?
</EM><BR>
[..]
<BR>
<P>Good questions, which I've wondered about. Obviously one would feel
<BR>
more confident with technology that is familiar.
<BR>
<P>If I had previously used one, the &quot;current&quot; me might still want to
<BR>
protect himself.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Familiarity with a system is NOT grounds for total trust! People have
<BR>
been duped by familar systems before, from department store foot
<BR>
X-rays to unsafe email!!
