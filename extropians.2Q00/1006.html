<EM>&gt; Jesus, this is frustrating.  What do you think we've been doing for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 20 years?  Do you think we haven't been trying like hell to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _allowed_ in the debates?  Do you think we haven't been sending
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; releases to the press every week for years?  Do you think we haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been using paper, the web, and every other medium available to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the message out?
</EM><BR>
<P>True, though one thing that Libertarians do all too often is run for Federal
<BR>
offices without having candidates for local offices.  A lot of people I talk
<BR>
to vote not so much for who they want, but for who they think can win and is
<BR>
closer to their views.  (I.e., they already narrow it down to two choices.)
<BR>
<P>Now, various LPs around the country are running for local offices and this
<BR>
is good, but it needs to be done more and more, especially since it would be
<BR>
easier to spend, say, $10K on a city council race and win or get a good %age
<BR>
of the vote as opposed to spending that same amount on a Congressional race
<BR>
and getting 1% or less of the vote.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It doesn't matter that nearly every radio talk show host in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; country hs called or including the LP in debates.  It doesn't matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that most newspapers have as well.  It doesn't matter that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; league of women voters (who used to sponsor the big debate) called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for inclusion.  The Ds &amp; Rs took over the process and created the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;non-partisan&quot; commission on debates specifically for the partisan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purpose of keeping out the LP, and as long as the television network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; media let them get away with it, it will work.
</EM><BR>
<P>One can complain, but it just shows that the current system is not stupid or
<BR>
dead.  It has to be outwitted -- not just bemoaned -- if you wish to win.
<BR>
Adrian Tymes in another post makes some good points on this.
<BR>
<P>Building up relationships with journalists is important too.  A lot of
<BR>
Libertarians just expect to get covered, but it takes a lot more than that
<BR>
and an LP candidate is always going to start with this handicap.  One can
<BR>
complain and continue to lose or do something about it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The existing system does everything in its power to supress third
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parties and keep them out of the process.  We have to spend most of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our money just getting ballot access--the major parties talk about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the democratic process, but when it threatens their power structure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are quick to subvert it and create barriers to entry, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they get away with it--because ignorant voters just assume that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the process is working and the third parties just aren't trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard enough.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, but the two major parties can't win everywhere at all times.  After
<BR>
all, Libertarians have gotten elected into city councils and state
<BR>
legislatures.  It has been done.  It can done again.
<BR>
<P>That said, I don't think it will be easy and I don't devote a heck of a lot
<BR>
of time to this.  (Though I've thrown a few $$$ into my friend Dave's
<BR>
campaign.:)
