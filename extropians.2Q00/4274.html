<P>If you want to optimize the materials usage, you want to split
<BR>
up the CO2, send the O2 to Mercury where you can merge it with
<BR>
the excess Fe from the planet's core forming Fe2O3, which is not
<BR>
a terrible structural material (not as good as Diamond or Sapphire,
<BR>
but the only other things iron is good for is core memories and
<BR>
radiation shields).  The fundamental problem is that oxygen is
<BR>
relatively abundant and so you need to distribute it among the
<BR>
metals because metal oxides are stronger than the metals themselves.
<BR>
Since carbon is more abundant than oxygen, you will always have
<BR>
CO2 available if you need it for a greenhouse gas, though you might
<BR>
have to ship in comets from the outer solar system.  On a minimum
<BR>
mass basis, you might be better off using chloro/flouro-carbons
<BR>
for your greenhouse gas, leaving more C(diamond) &amp; Metal-On available
<BR>
for other construction activities.
<BR>
<P>We need to work out whether the best use of the available Cl/F
<BR>
is for habitat greenhouse gases.  One nice thing, is that their
<BR>
mass is higher than CO2, so you can use them more effectively
<BR>
on smaller planetoids without worrying about their escaping.
<BR>
<P>I'm still puzzled over what to do with the relative abundance of
<BR>
magnesium.  Not a great structural material as a metal or MgO.
<BR>
Perhaps a propellant in the ion drives, since you have to eject
<BR>
*something*.  The nitrogen, sodium &amp; potassium don't appear to be
<BR>
of much use either.
<BR>
<P>There is an entire field of solar-system-forming that is fairly
<BR>
unexplored.  It is probably a universal problem because the
<BR>
generally believed theories of solar system formation dictate
<BR>
that the heavy elements form planets close to the sun while the
<BR>
lighter elements (including much of the C in CH4 &amp; CO2) end
<BR>
up in the outer regions of the solar system, which would not
<BR>
seem to be where you ultimately want it.
