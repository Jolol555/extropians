<P>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps there are other people who think I am stupid, sentimental or sloppy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in my thinking, but you are the only one who consistently says it.  If you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot disagree with my ideas without calling them stupid, please do not read 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my posts or respond to them.
</EM><BR>
<P>That phenomenon is interesting, and seems to be an effect of an
<BR>
interesting interaction: (1) I read all posts made, in order, with
<BR>
no heed to poster or thread; (2) When I see any opinion or idea
<BR>
expressed that I have strong opinions about, I respond with my own,
<BR>
quoting only the words being responded to; (3) You and I seem to be
<BR>
interested in similar topics, but come at them from nearly opposite
<BR>
points of view; (4) I'm frequently rude.
<BR>
<P>These factors combine into an effect that might look like a
<BR>
personal attack.  But if there were someone else that had similar
<BR>
interests and differing opinions, the same thing would happen.
<BR>
Not that I shun personal attacks when appropriate, but this isn't
<BR>
one--it just looks that way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ... Yet [others] know how to treat people decently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and deal with me in a gentlemanly fashion. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Politeness is a disease I have no use for, and I've made that
<BR>
case many times before so I won't repeat it here (look in the
<BR>
archives--I think the word &quot;rude&quot; is in the titles of many
<BR>
messages in the thread).  You are, of course, free to call me a
<BR>
boorish ass, and I will not object.  It's interesting that
<BR>
you use the word &quot;gentlemanly&quot;: even more than politeness in
<BR>
general I have no respect at all for patronizing paternalism.
<BR>
If you think I should give you a break because of your gender,
<BR>
think again.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Personally I don't think there's one stupid person on this list.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, but there's lots of stupid ideas, some of mine included.
<BR>
I will not cripple the effective communication here by coddling
<BR>
people's feelings instead of telling it like I see it.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
