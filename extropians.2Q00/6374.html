<P><EM>&gt; Mark Steyn devoted his monthly column in the July 2000 &quot;American
</EM><BR>
Spectator&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  magazine to violent crime in Britain, with a particular focus on victims
</EM><BR>
who
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  were prosecuted for resisting violent attacks. Many Britons are now
</EM><BR>
fearful
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  of defending themselves, not because they think their assailants will
</EM><BR>
treat
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  them any worse, but because the police and courts will.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a British citizen this is something I have thought about and talked
<BR>
about in depth with friends. The concensus seems to be that most people
<BR>
would
<BR>
use whatever force they deemed neccessary to protect themselves and their
<BR>
possesions. Of course when it comes to the crunch, I think most people would
<BR>
be too shocked to put up as much of a fight as they would want to.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one would shoot first and worry about the consequences later.
<BR>
Unfortunately a paintball gun probably wouldn't give me much protection from
<BR>
a buglar, but at least a luminous green painted criminal would be easier for
<BR>
the police to find.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public opinion here is just about 100% behind anyone that does harm to
<BR>
someone attacking them or their property and it seems that the law is
<BR>
becoming more leaniant towards anyone in this position. At the end of the
<BR>
day, 2 wrongs..........so I think the emphisis should be on preventing the
<BR>
crime in the first place rather than aguing about any crimes that were as a
<BR>
direct result. Also if criminals know that their victims will get off scott
<BR>
free for bludgeoning them to death with a golf club in the name of self
<BR>
defense, They are more likely to carry weapons and use them for their own
<BR>
defence.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cha..ching........oops, my two cents ran out. I was just getting
<BR>
started.
