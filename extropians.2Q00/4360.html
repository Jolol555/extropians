What do you think of this? We only have one toll road here currently, but
<BR>
they certainly could convert some of the others.
<BR>
<P>And then of course there was the suggestion a few days back of letting
<BR>
people pay to have traffic lights turn green.

<BR>
<P>In the last two weeks I've been to Boston, Atlanta, Charleston, DC, London,
<BR>
and Paris and am now on a flight back to Seattle, and all this traveling
<BR>
gives me a lot of time to think about traffic.  Not net congestion, of
<BR>
course, but the kind that can cause a trip from downtown London to Heathrow
<BR>
to take over an hour.
<BR>
<P>Now, please don't talk about how any kind of cool new auto-driving
<BR>
technology will help things, because it will be decades before the legal
<BR>
liability issues are resolved for any sort of technological solution.
<BR>
Building more roads doesn't help because people just move farther away.  HOV
<BR>
lanes are completely unrealistic in today's work world, where factory shifts
<BR>
are nearly a thing of the past.  So, the answer has to lie in the world of
<BR>
economics, and specifically in the sub-branch of political economics.
<BR>
<P>Traffic congestion causes enormous costs on all of us in terms of the time
<BR>
we're stuck unproductively in a car.  And yes, cell-phones and NPR make our
<BR>
car time more productive, but this is clearly not our optimal activity, as
<BR>
evidenced by the fact that we don't keep sitting in our cars on arriving
<BR>
home.  Many of us who are stuck would pay others to get off the road, but
<BR>
there is no mechanism to do this.  The real problem, though, is one of
<BR>
political economy.  Most people would see variable rate toll pricing (the
<BR>
obvious way to charge for the congestion one causes) as a tool to allow rich
<BR>
people to drive whenever they want to, with no benefit to them.  This
<BR>
situation has been denigrated as &quot;Lexus lanes&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Economics says that to eliminate the externality of congestion costs, you
<BR>
could internalize the costs by creating a market to incentivize drivers to
<BR>
schedule their day in a way that doesn't create congestion costs for others.
<BR>
The real solution has to be a political one, though, because people need to
<BR>
accept that congestion costs and toll costs are being fairly allocated.
<BR>
<P>So, here's the idea.  Take a stretch of road that already has an E-Z Pass
<BR>
system installed, like the Dulles Tollway.  Announce that pricing will be
<BR>
dynamically adjusted to keep the road basically free from congestion.  That
<BR>
is, prices could go up from the standard quarter to $10 or $20 or more when
<BR>
the road gets crowded.  You would want to do some sort of averaging over the
<BR>
previous 30 minutes to avoid having outrageous instantaneous price spikes.
<BR>
<P>The key, though, is that people who use the road off of rush hour would
<BR>
receive a negative toll price: they would get paid for not having driven
<BR>
during rush hour.  The negative toll price would fluctuate as well, to
<BR>
approximately equal the revenues brought in by the positive tolls.  And, you
<BR>
wouldn't institute this just for E-Z Pass customers.  You'd actually be
<BR>
handed a dollar (or whatever) by the tollbooth operator when you drive
<BR>
through.  Although, your license plate would need to be recorded, and the
<BR>
roads would allow you to receive money back only once per day but would
<BR>
require you to pay the going price (if it's positive) each time you came
<BR>
through.  Otherwise, someone could go through a short section of toll road
<BR>
one way and circle back using back roads.
<BR>
<P>Places like the NJ turnpike have tried differential pricing by time, but the
<BR>
peak pricing has been less than 200% of the average ($0.50 vs. $1 doesn't
<BR>
get people's attention).  Congestion pricing (where you're aiming for zero
<BR>
congestion) says that the price should keep going up until enough people are
<BR>
persuaded to take a different route home or change their schedule.  And in
<BR>
this plan, people may very well be willing to pay those high prices because
<BR>
they know that if they waited just an hour or so that they could actually
<BR>
make money back rather than paying it out.  So, it becomes a simple question
<BR>
of opportunity cost.
<BR>
<P>Also, note that this scheme is not just a redistribution of wealth from rich
<BR>
people in a hurry to those who can't afford the peak toll rates.  Congestion
<BR>
is an externality that makes all of us poorer.  Thus, eliminating it should
<BR>
create enough economic value to make nearly everyone better off -- everyone
<BR>
can get home without any congestion and those who are inconvenienced by
<BR>
changing their schedules are paid for it.  Of course, the plan would work
<BR>
even better if people could get paged or use a WAP browser with the current
<BR>
traffic/pricing conditions (they'd be synonymous), but there are all kinds
<BR>
of optimizations one could look at it.
<BR>
<P>The key thing is to get a test going, and to work the presentation of the
<BR>
concept to win over people to the idea.
