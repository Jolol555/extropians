<P>
The recursive connection of higher-order maps to the lower-order
<BR>
maps which feed them can generate &quot;synthetic&quot; sensory input via
<BR>
&quot;recursive synthesis&quot; (RP p. 88), resulting in effects such as
<BR>
the illusory contours of the Kanizsa triangle (RP pp. 79
<BR>
[Fig. 4.4]; BABF p. 39 [Fig. 4-2]).  &quot;The possibility of
<BR>
reentering signals in a recursive fashion to a lower-order mapped
<BR>
input after they have been processed in several high-order maps
<BR>
is an enormously powerful way of creating **new** functions.
<BR>
Since this process of recursive synthesis occurs in various
<BR>
successive time chunks, it allows for asymptotic approaches to a
<BR>
great variety of different outputs in complex nervous systems&quot;
<BR>
(RP p. 69; see also BABF p. 89).  Similarly, &quot;crosstalk&quot; among
<BR>
sensory modalities and submodalities can generate other sensory
<BR>
&quot;illusions&quot; via &quot;cross-modal construction&quot; (RP p. 88), causing,
<BR>
for example, a sensation of color or stereo depth to undergo
<BR>
apparent motion, or illusory borders to appear surrounding
<BR>
streams randomly-placed dots in motion (RP pp. 79-89).
<BR>
<P>Edelman emphasizes that the complexity of interconnection due to
<BR>
reentry in higher brains has no analog among other natural
<BR>
phenomena or among human artifacts: &quot;A jungle or food web, like
<BR>
the brain, has many levels and routes for the passage of signals,
<BR>
but has nothing corresponding to reentrant anatomy.  Indeed, if
<BR>
asked, 'What characteristic uniquely differentiates higher brains
<BR>
from all other known objects or systems', we would say 'reentrant
<BR>
organization.'  Note that while complex wide-area computer
<BR>
networks are beginning to share some properties with reentrant
<BR>
systems, such networks rely fundamentally on codes and, unlike
<BR>
brain networks, they are instructional, not selectional&quot; (UoC
<BR>
p. 85; see also UoC p. 49, p. 151 [Fig. 10.1]; ND pp. 147-148
<BR>
[evolution of reentry in vertebrates and their precursors]).
<BR>
<P>Reentry is not the same as feedback in the traditional
<BR>
engineering sense.  Feedback is generally carried by a single
<BR>
unidirectional connection path (versus rentry's multiple,
<BR>
reciprocal paths), and has the fixed function of supplying a
<BR>
computed control or error-correction signal (whereas reentrant
<BR>
connections have no prespecified function or information
<BR>
content).  &quot;Like feedback, however, reentry can be local (within
<BR>
a map) or global (among maps and whole regions)&quot; (UoC p. 85; RP
<BR>
pp. 285-286).
<BR>
<P>The reentrant signalling between a primary map of a particular
<BR>
sensory modality or sub-modality and other primary maps or
<BR>
secondary maps (which are simultaneously linked, directly or
<BR>
indirectly, to primary maps of all other sensory modalities)
<BR>
enables the brain to spontaneously mirror the spatial and
<BR>
temporal correlations among features and events in the external
<BR>
world.  This capability, according to Edelman, forms one of the
<BR>
bases of perceptual categorization.  The simplest example of this
<BR>
is the &quot;classification couple&quot;: &quot;a minimal unit consisting of two
<BR>
functionally different maps made up of neuronal groups and
<BR>
connected by reentry.  Each map **independently** receives
<BR>
signals from other brain maps or from the world...  Within a
<BR>
certain time period, reentrant signalling strongly connects
<BR>
certain active combinations of neuronal groups in one map to
<BR>
different combinations in the other map.  This occurs through the
<BR>
strengthening and weakening of synapses within groups in each map
<BR>
and also at their connection with reentrant fibers.  In this way,
<BR>
functions and activities in one map are connected and correlated
<BR>
with those in another map.  This occurs even though each map is
<BR>
receiving independent signals from the world: One set of inputs
<BR>
could be, for example, from vision, and the other from touch...
<BR>
This connectivity is not limited to a pair of maps or to any one
<BR>
moment of time.  The interactions of **multiple** maps can be
<BR>
coordinated in the same fashion&quot; (BABF p. 87).
<BR>
<P>When maps associated with more than two sensory modalities are
<BR>
thus correlated by reentry, the result is a &quot;classification
<BR>
n-tuple&quot;: &quot;pair-wise or higher-order interactions of reentrant
<BR>
maps...  form so-called classification couples or n-tuples, which
<BR>
combine the results of independent disjunctive samplings to yield
<BR>
categorization&quot; (RP p. 243).  This correlative activity obviates
<BR>
the need for a &quot;projection screen&quot;, a &quot;Cartesian theater&quot; (see
<BR>
Daniel C. Dennett's _Consciousness Explained_; Little, Brown;
<BR>
Boston; 1991; p. 39), or a supervisor in the brain: &quot;The result
<BR>
of the selection of appropriate neuronal groups is a covariance,
<BR>
**not** an image or a sketch...  The existence of at least
<BR>
thirteen separate visual centers in cortical and subcortical
<BR>
regions, for example, does **not** require a central 'scratch
<BR>
pad', as is implied by certain... computational theories&quot; (ND
<BR>
p. 233).  &quot;According to this interpretation, the categorical
<BR>
response of an organism depends to a very large degree upon the
<BR>
particular physical features of its receptor sheets and their
<BR>
positions on body parts as developed during evolution.  This is
<BR>
not meant in the banal sense that if cones were not present,
<BR>
color would not be sensed.  Rather, it is intended to imply that
<BR>
the physical structure of rods and cones or of the cochlear
<BR>
apparatus, for example, are already adapted by evolution to
<BR>
abstract major adaptive properties, and that the function of
<BR>
higher-order neural networks is not to 'compute' but to correlate
<BR>
these abstracted properties by further reentrant selection among
<BR>
selected populations of particular neuronal groups, as driven by
<BR>
motion.  Given the possibility of neuronal group selection, with
<BR>
its rich combinatorial possibilities, the nature of the
<BR>
transducers and of the relation to the motor ensemble puts by far
<BR>
the single greatest constraint upon the capacity of such a system
<BR>
to categorize and generalize&quot; (ND p. 234).
<BR>
<P>The architecture of reentrant interconnection among cortical maps
<BR>
thus provides a solution to the &quot;binding problem&quot;: &quot;When we
<BR>
see... a scene, we are not aware of colors, movements, and forms
<BR>
separately and independently, but bind the color with the shape
<BR>
and the movement into recognizable objects...  How can a set of
<BR>
diverse and functionally segregated maps cohere without a
<BR>
higher-order controller? ...  A set of models and computer
<BR>
simulations [UoC pp. 114-120; the model can discriminate and move
<BR>
a camera to track a red cross in a visual field containing
<BR>
independently moving red cross, red square, green cross, and thus
<BR>
binds shape and color]... has shown that binding can occur as a
<BR>
result of reentry across brain maps that establishes short-term
<BR>
temporal correlations and synchrony among the activities of
<BR>
widely spaced neuronal groups in different maps...  Thus, reentry
<BR>
correlates a large number of dynamic circuits in space and time.
<BR>
The selection of those circuits that are temporally correlated
<BR>
under constraints of value leads to a coherent output.  This
<BR>
binding principle, made possible by reentry, is repeated across
<BR>
many levels of brain organization and plays a central role in
<BR>
mechanisms leading to consciousness&quot; (UoC pp. 106-107).
<BR>
<P>The automatic correlations of disjoint properties performed by
<BR>
classification n-tuples solve the problems that would otherwise
<BR>
result from having to fix the boundaries of an imposed, top-down
<BR>
categorization scheme: &quot;While the world is not amorphous and the
<BR>
**properties** of objects are describable in terms of chemistry
<BR>
and physics... it is clear that, at the macroscopic level,
<BR>
objects do not come in predefined categories, are variable in
<BR>
time, occur as novelties, and are responded to in terms of
<BR>
relative adaptive value to the organism rather than of veridical
<BR>
description.  This lends a relativistic and disjunctive flavor to
<BR>
the categorization of objects by animals: things are partitioned
<BR>
according to those factors that are significant for and available
<BR>
to the perceiving animal.  Feature shaping occurs according to
<BR>
the particular sets of saliences, cues, and contexts presented at
<BR>
some time and in some sequence.  There is a fundamental ambiguity
<BR>
in classifying objects...&quot; (ND pp. 259-260; BABF p. 233). By
<BR>
means of reentrant maps forming classification n-tuples, &quot;The
<BR>
unlabeled world (which follows the laws of physics but in which
<BR>
biologically adaptive patterns occur that are not described by
<BR>
physics) is disjunctively sampled by various parallel
<BR>
sensorimotor channels&quot; (RP p. 243).  &quot;Generalization can occur on
<BR>
the basis of any combination of local features or feature
<BR>
correlations resulting from disjunctive sampling of signals from
<BR>
objects not encountered before.  The reentry will link the
<BR>
responses to those combinations to previous patterns of
<BR>
responses&quot; (ND p. 264 [Fig. 9.5]; see also ND p. 62 [Fig 3.4]; RP
<BR>
pp. 48 [Fig 3.3], 49-50).
<BR>
<P>Since the occurrence of a classification n-tuple modifies the
<BR>
likelihood of the subsequent occurrence of a similar (but
<BR>
probably not identical) classification n-tuple because of the
<BR>
plasticity of the synaptic connections among the neuronal groups
<BR>
comprising it, and since such an n-tuple may subsequently be
<BR>
triggered by sensory input sufficiently similar to that which
<BR>
caused the original, possibly in only a subset of the sensory
<BR>
modalities (or a subset of the input in a given modality) that
<BR>
originally activated it, these n-tuples also form one of the
<BR>
bases of memory (BABF p. 103 [Fig. 10-1]).  Ongoing perceptual
<BR>
categorization is therefore always to some extent a
<BR>
re-categorization, depending not only on current sensory input,
<BR>
but on an organism's past history of such categorizations.  In
<BR>
other words, the present is always to some extent a &quot;remembered
<BR>
present&quot; (hence the book title of RP; see UoC p. 78).
<BR>
Recategorical memory is an inexact and probabilistic re-enactment
<BR>
of prior similar events, not the retrieval of an exact replica of
<BR>
a prior event, as occurs in human-made information storage and
<BR>
retrieval systems (BABF p. 104).
<BR>
<P>Edelman applies principles of neuronal group selection and
<BR>
degeneracy to the motor (output) side of the nervous system as
<BR>
well as the sensory (input) side (see ND Chap. 8).  In the
<BR>
interaction between the nervous system and the musculoskeletal
<BR>
systems of the body, &quot;the linkage between brain regions and
<BR>
muscles **cannot** be absolutely strict.  This suggests that any
<BR>
fixed model of control loops for motor behavior is not likely to
<BR>
be generally correct, at least not for more complex nonautomatic
<BR>
movements.  The units of action are not muscles or joints or
<BR>
simple feedback loops but functional complexes or synergies
<BR>
(patterns of movements) in the phenotype that are more akin to
<BR>
gestures, postures, and their transitions...&quot; (ND p. 220).  &quot;By a
<BR>
'gesture', I mean the degenerate set of all those coordinated
<BR>
motions that can produce a particular pattern that is adaptive in
<BR>
a phenotype&quot; (ND p. 227).  &quot;[T]he brain deals mainly with
<BR>
**patterns** of movement.  A gesture is one of the degenerate set
<BR>
of all those coordinated movements that produce a particular
<BR>
pattern.  A closely related notion is that of a synergy -- a
<BR>
class of related gestures&quot; (RP pp. 120-121).  The postulation of
<BR>
unitary gestures and synergies follows from the consideration of
<BR>
&quot;[m]ovements of an organism... as morphological objects -- they
<BR>
develop, react, and evolve in definite epigenetic patterns&quot; (ND
<BR>
p. 223).  During infancy and childhood, &quot;through successive
<BR>
stages, the locomotor system reorganizes epigenetically, setting
<BR>
new problems for the C[entral] N[ervous] S[ystem] to which it
<BR>
must adapt.  This process involves costs in energy that must be
<BR>
minimized&quot; (ND p. 223).
<BR>
<P>The details of these &quot;synergies&quot;, or patterns of movement, cannot
<BR>
be known in advance any more than the categories of the inputs
<BR>
that will be received by sensory systems: &quot;[T]he functional
<BR>
nonunivocality of connections between the CNS and the periphery
<BR>
are closely related to the notion of degeneracy...  [The] sources
<BR>
of this many-to-one mapping [are] (1) anatomy -- the number of
<BR>
degrees of freedom in complex kinematic chains, the multiplicity
<BR>
of action of muscles, the variation of action with the
<BR>
disposition of limb segments, and the impossibility of the
<BR>
existence of fixed antagonists; (2) the mechanical complexity of
<BR>
multisegmented kinematic chains, the activity of which leads to
<BR>
variant reactive forces following Newton's laws; and (3)
<BR>
physiological variance in central effector impulses.  The overall
<BR>
conclusion is that motor consequences of central impulses must be
<BR>
decided peripherally as well as centrally.  Even in repetitive
<BR>
motion of limbs, for example, it cannot be that the brain
<BR>
**computes** the postural algorithm to accommodate for body
<BR>
recoil by Newton's third law.  Selection must occur in such a
<BR>
fashion as to bring to lower values the number of degrees of
<BR>
freedom in the periphery...&quot; (ND pp. 232-233).  &quot;Such gestures
<BR>
must be considered as **patterns to be recognized** by somatic
<BR>
selection in the nervous system&quot; (ND p. 220).  Synergies are
<BR>
treated by the category-forming interactions in the brain &quot;the
<BR>
same way sensory systems treat signals from the environment:
<BR>
categorical and associative relationships can be **built up**
<BR>
centrally (mainly in the cortex...&quot; (ND p. 230).
<BR>
<P>To complete the picture of perceptual categorization, Edelman
<BR>
describes sensory classification n-tuples (comprising multiple
<BR>
reentrant local maps) as well as classification n-tuples
<BR>
dedicated to the categorization of gestures, synergies or
<BR>
patterns of movement (comprising multiple motor maps) as being
<BR>
linked together in larger-scale structures which he calls &quot;global
<BR>
mappings&quot; (RP pp. 54-56, 121; BABF p. 89), whose activity is
<BR>
distributed widely throughout the thalamocortical system, which
<BR>
correlate motor as well as sensory activity, and which interface
<BR>
with nonmapped, specialized regions of the brain outside the
<BR>
cortex (the cortical appendages, organs of succession related to
<BR>
sequencing of movements and sequencing of categorizations leading
<BR>
to memory): &quot;a global mapping [is] a dynamic system consisting of
<BR>
**multiple** reentrant local maps correlating sensory input
<BR>
**and** motor activity and interacting with nonmapped regions to
<BR>
form a representation of objects and events&quot; (ND p. 227, see ND
<BR>
p. 228 [Fig. 8.5]).  &quot;Motor activity as reflected in global
<BR>
mappings leads to the production of synergies, which are
<BR>
essential elements in categorizing certain kinds of sensory input
<BR>
as well as in categorizing movement itself.  The result of the
<BR>
combined activities of synergies and tactile and visuomotor
<BR>
coordination is the selection of neuronal groups in such a way as
<BR>
to correlate and link the synergies and their transitions...
<BR>
Because, in forming synergies, sensory sheets are moved in real
<BR>
time, their linkage is a source of feature **correlation** and
<BR>
not just of feature **detection**.  In this correlation, the
<BR>
cerebral cortex relates the neuronal groups receiving
<BR>
proprioceptive input from musculotendinous receptors to groups
<BR>
receiving visual and tactile inputs, principally in the parietal
<BR>
cortex&quot; (RP p. 121).  This completes the loop connecting the
<BR>
ongoing sampling of sensory receptors to the movements of the
<BR>
body that carries them: &quot;Such a global mapping ensures the
<BR>
creation of a dynamic loop that continually matches an animal's
<BR>
gestures and posture to the independent sampling of several kinds
<BR>
of sensory signals&quot; (BABF p. 89).  &quot;The construction and shaping
<BR>
of a global mapping are... driven by ongoing motor activity,
<BR>
building upon the result of past activities...  Such a mapping is
<BR>
dynamic, and it depends... upon unceasing exploratory movements
<BR>
and constant motor rehearsals in interactions with the
<BR>
environment&quot; (ND p. 230).
<BR>
<P>To reiterate, according to Edelman, a &quot;given classification
<BR>
couple, or even a classification n-tuple, is in general
<BR>
insufficient [to yield perceptual categorization].  Instead, a
<BR>
global mapping...  is required...  The concept of a global
<BR>
mapping takes account of the fact that perception depends upon
<BR>
and leads to action.  In this view, categorization does not occur
<BR>
solely in a sensory area that then executes a program to activate
<BR>
motor output.  Instead, the results of continual motor activity
<BR>
are considered to be an essential part of perceptual
<BR>
categorization.  This implies that global mappings carrying out
<BR>
such categorization contain both sensory and motor elements&quot; (RP
<BR>
p. 54).  The motor component of perceptual categorization and of
<BR>
the global mappings it is based on is, claims Edelman, an
<BR>
essential ingredient in the ability of an organism exhibiting
<BR>
primary consciousness to partition the world into objects and
<BR>
scenes: &quot;[An] essential aspect of categorization is the
<BR>
**definition of an object** (and, above all, its continuity
<BR>
properties) by the responding organism...  [T]he categorization
<BR>
of surfaces or textures... is necessary but not sufficient to
<BR>
define objects, inasmuch as the continuity properties of a
<BR>
contour are not inherently definable topologically by a static
<BR>
receptor sheet.  There are several ways in which an 'object' may
<BR>
be categorized via motion or depth cues, however...  It is in
<BR>
connection with object definition that the relation of various
<BR>
forms of motor activity to sensory input comes to the fore.  The
<BR>
evolutionary development of eye movements, head and neck
<BR>
movements, and coordinated evolutionary patterns of correlation
<BR>
of these movements with limb extension are key adaptive features.
<BR>
They not only prepare animals for appropriate responses but also
<BR>
serve to relate feature extraction by sensory sheets to the
<BR>
global feature correlation that accompanies the definition of an
<BR>
object.  This is a key point in relating movement to
<BR>
categorization&quot; (ND p. 232).
<BR>
<P>Edelman hypothesizes that the cortex gets specialized assistance
<BR>
in binding sensory classification n-tuples to gestures and
<BR>
sequences of gestures to form global mappings and the perceptual
<BR>
categorizations that depend on them, from morphologically
<BR>
distinct areas of the brain which he calls &quot;cortical appendages&quot;.
<BR>
&quot;Although the specific ways in which [the] different cortical
<BR>
appendages interact with the cortex are of central importance,
<BR>
the appendages all seem to share a fundamental mode of
<BR>
organization (especially the cerebellum and basal ganglia): Long,
<BR>
parallel paths involving multiple synapses leave the cerebral
<BR>
cortex and reach successive synaptic stations within these
<BR>
cortical appendages and eventually, whether they pass through the
<BR>
thalamus or not, they go back to the cortex...  This serial
<BR>
polysynaptic architecture differs radically from that of the
<BR>
thalamocortical system: The connections are generally
<BR>
unidirectional, rather than reciprocal, and form long loops, and
<BR>
there are relatively few horizontal interactions among different
<BR>
circuits...  In short, these systems seem admirably suited to the
<BR>
execution of a variety of complicated motor and cognitive
<BR>
routines, most of which are as functionally insulated as possible
<BR>
from each other, a feature that guarantees speed and precision in
<BR>
their execution&quot; (UoC pp. 43 [Fig. 4.4], 45-46).
<BR>
<P>One cortical appendage associated with motor activity is the
<BR>
cerebellum, which operates over the relatively short periods of
<BR>
time required for the generation of a single gesture or synergy.
<BR>
The cerebellum &quot;smoothly coordinate[s] the sensorimotor
<BR>
components of a synergy in short periods of real time in a
<BR>
feed-forward fashion&quot; (RP p. 121).  &quot;For such a task, it must
<BR>
clearly have a very large sensory input, and both anatomical and
<BR>
physiological evidence suggests that this is so&quot; (RP p. 122).
<BR>
&quot;The cerebellum acts in motor adaptations of vestibuloocular
<BR>
reflexes, saccades, and functional stretch reflexes, and it
<BR>
regulates reflex gain control.  Concerned with the signaling of
<BR>
errors in movement control, it does not itself generate motor
<BR>
programs, because, without input, it acts only in 300 msec
<BR>
intervals or less.  But it is essential for timing and
<BR>
synchronization of smooth movements and for linkages of responses
<BR>
to novel sensory stimuli...  It is **not** connected to the
<BR>
limbic system in any strong fashion...&quot;  (RP p. 138).  &quot;[T]he
<BR>
provision of... temporal coordination is the main role of the
<BR>
cerebellum, which **together** with the motor cortex (and the
<BR>
spinal cord) contributes to global mappings that allow
<BR>
registration, linkage, and smooth succession of movements.  Such
<BR>
a succession is a critical part of the categorization of motion,
<BR>
particularly in novel tasks and situations.  It is also an
<BR>
essential part of the workings of the classification n-tuples
<BR>
dedicated to the categorizations of gestures themselves&quot; (RP
<BR>
p. 121).
<BR>
<P>The &quot;basal ganglia&quot; (a group of structures, including the
<BR>
striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra, treated
<BR>
collectively (RP p. 135 [Fig. 7.3]) constitute the other cortical
<BR>
appendage involved with movement.  &quot;These are a large and complex
<BR>
set of structures located deep at the center of the brain.  They
<BR>
connect to the cerebral cortex in a series of parallel circuits
<BR>
involved in eye and body movements, as well as to the frontal
<BR>
portions of the cortex, the function of which is related to
<BR>
behavioral planning and emotions&quot; (BABF p. 106).  While Edelman
<BR>
acknowledges that his hypothesis about the role of these organs
<BR>
is to some degree speculative (RP p. 133), he believes this
<BR>
cortical appendage to be concerned with the sequencing of motor
<BR>
programs and the choice and execution of motor plans, over time
<BR>
periods longer than those associated with the cerebellum (300
<BR>
msec to several seconds [RP p. 139]), and under the influence of
<BR>
motivational states due to input from the limbic system and brain
<BR>
stem (RP p. 137).  Motor programs are &quot;sets of muscle commands
<BR>
put together before the beginning of a movement sequence.  They
<BR>
permit that sequence to be carried out without peripheral
<BR>
feedback...&quot; (RP p. 133).  Motor plans are larger behavioral
<BR>
units entailing sequences of motor programs: &quot;[Motor programs]
<BR>
are linked by the motor system into complexes that can be
<BR>
affected by planning, thought, and intention&quot; (RP p. 133).  &quot;[The
<BR>
basal ganglia] not only help regulate movement in a motor program
<BR>
by coupling sensory and motor responses but also help direct what
<BR>
is to be done according to a motor plan.  Notice that, unlike the
<BR>
cerebellum, which smooths and coordinates more immediate
<BR>
gestures, this appendage works over longer time scales and helps
<BR>
correlate whole sequences of gestures in a plan...  The basal
<BR>
ganglia are also intimately connected to the hedonic centers of
<BR>
the brain, and... they very likely play a role in attention (BABF
<BR>
p. 106).  Following Edelman's logic so far, one assumes that
<BR>
motor plans are also categorized in the cortex by means of
<BR>
classification n-tuples, and that these highest-level motor
<BR>
complexes also participate en bloc either in global mappings
<BR>
corresponding to perceptual categories or in the classifications
<BR>
of global mappings corresponding to conceptual categories (see
<BR>
below).
<BR>
<P>Selection at the level of perceptual categories (global mappings)
<BR>
is constrained by values: &quot;[C]ategorization always occurs in
<BR>
reference to internal criteria of value and... this reference
<BR>
defines its appropriateness.  Such value criteria do not
<BR>
determine specific categorizations but they constrain the domains
<BR>
in which they occur...  [T]he bases for value systems in the
<BR>
animals of a given species are already set by evolutionary
<BR>
selection.  They are exhibited in those regions of the brain
<BR>
concerned with regulating bodily functions: heartbeat, breathing,
<BR>
sexual responses, feeding responses, endocrine functions,
<BR>
autonomic responses.  Categorization manifests itself in behavior
<BR>
that appropriately fulfills the evolutionarily selected
<BR>
requirements of such life-supporting physiological systems&quot; (BABF
<BR>
pp. 90-91).  &quot;[T]he driving forces of animal behavior
<BR>
are... evolutionarily selected value patterns that help the brain
<BR>
and the body maintain conditions necessary to continue life.
<BR>
These systems are called homeostats.  It is the coupling of
<BR>
motion and sensory sampling resulting in behavior that changes
<BR>
the levels of homeostats.  Aside from those occasional
<BR>
species-specific behavior patterns that have been selected for
<BR>
directly by evolution, however, most categorization leading to
<BR>
behavior that changes homeostatic levels occurs by a **somatic**
<BR>
selection of neuronal groups in each animal.  Categorization is
<BR>
not the same as value, but occurs **on** value.  It is an
<BR>
epigenetic developmental event, and no amount of value-based
<BR>
circuitry leads to its occurrence without experiential selection
<BR>
of neuronal groups.  But it is also true that without prior
<BR>
value, somatic selectional systems will not converge into
<BR>
definite behaviors&quot; (BABF p. 94).
<BR>
<P>Up to this point, the global mappings linking classification
<BR>
n-tuples dealing with sensory input and motor output have all
<BR>
been concerned with immediate interactions with events and
<BR>
objects in the world outside the animal's skin.  As the next step
<BR>
to consciousness, Edelman postulates that the cortex is capable
<BR>
of forming classification n-tuples which categorize its own
<BR>
global mappings (without going into great detail about the
<BR>
machinery by which this takes place, other than to lean heavily
<BR>
on the characteristic cortical morphology of reentrant maps).
<BR>
Edelman calls these categorizations of categorizations
<BR>
&quot;concepts&quot;, employing his own non-linguistic definition of that
<BR>
word (RP Chap. 8; BABF pp. 108-110).  &quot;[I]n forming concepts, the
<BR>
brain constructs maps of its **own** activities, not just of
<BR>
external stimuli, as in perception...  [T]he brain areas
<BR>
responsible for concept formation... categorize, discriminate,
<BR>
and recombine the various brain activities occurring **in
<BR>
different kinds of global mappings**...  [They] categorize parts
<BR>
of past global mappings according to modality, the presence of
<BR>
absence of movement, and the presence of absence of relationships
<BR>
between perceptual categorizations...  Structures able to perform
<BR>
these activities are likely to be found in the frontal, temporal,
<BR>
and parietal cortices of the brain.  They must represent **a
<BR>
mapping of types of maps** (BABF p. 109).  &quot;To succumb to the
<BR>
temptation [to consider concepts as properties of language] I
<BR>
just warned against, one might suspect that **if** an animal with
<BR>
concepts could speak, it would reveal its concepts as ontological
<BR>
categories -- things, motions, and classes...  In their most
<BR>
elaborate form, concepts may serve as bases for image schemata
<BR>
('object', 'motion', 'barrier', 'container', etc.)  summarizing a
<BR>
variety of general physical situations&quot; (RP p. 141).  Concepts
<BR>
are a form of long-term memory: &quot;The categorizations and
<BR>
generalizations reflected in concepts are much richer, more
<BR>
abstract, and therefore less immediate than those seen in
<BR>
perceptual categorization.  They may involve the memory of much
<BR>
earlier or more distant events... and less than immediate
<BR>
reference to various objects.  Concepts may involve judgments
<BR>
made in absence -- judgments made ahout classifications of
<BR>
stimuli long past&quot; (RP. p. 142).
<BR>
<P>The cortex does not form concepts directly from the &quot;raw&quot; global
<BR>
mappings being activated in the immediate present, Edelman
<BR>
hypothesizes, but instead relies on a third specialized cortical
<BR>
appendage to gather input from currently-activated global
<BR>
mappings in the cortex, edit and sequence them (based partly on
<BR>
value signals from the limbic system), and replay the edited
<BR>
stream, as a sort of home movie of the recent past, back to the
<BR>
cortex.  This cortical appendage is the organ of succession known
<BR>
as the hippocampus: &quot;[T]he hippocampus...  receives inputs from
<BR>
practically **all** regions of the cerebral cortex, through a
<BR>
smaller region known as the entorhinal cortex.  These inputs run
<BR>
through the hippocampus in a sequence of three successive
<BR>
synapses.  Having passed through these structures, the signals
<BR>
loop back through the entorhinal cortex and are relayed back by
<BR>
reentrant fibers to the cortical areas that originally connected
<BR>
with it.  Cells inside the hippocampal loop all receive
<BR>
simultaneous connections indirectly from the midbrain and hedonic
<BR>
areas, areas subserving value&quot; (BABF p. 106; see also RP
<BR>
pp. 127-133).  &quot;[W]hile classification couples and global
<BR>
mappings undergo neuronal group selection by synaptic change,
<BR>
this in itself is not enough to assure the relationship between
<BR>
short-term and long-term memory.  Unless organs of succession
<BR>
such as the hippocampus intervene and order the results, it
<BR>
appears that severe memory defects will ensue&quot; (BABF p. 107).
<BR>
&quot;The time units of succession are roughly (1) those of cortical
<BR>
excitation patterns occurring in a period of 10 msec, the basis
<BR>
of ongoing perceptual flux; (2) **sequences** of such events from
<BR>
100 msec to 1 sec, corresponding to the integration of perceptual
<BR>
categories; and (3) **chains** of such sequences occupying longer
<BR>
times and related to learning and fixation of secondary synaptic
<BR>
strengths in the cortex.  It is important to emphasize that the
<BR>
ordering of time chunks (i.e., of signals represented in global
<BR>
mappings) is not a simple reverberating circuit.  Overlap,
<BR>
divergence of inputs, and mixing of signals prevent such a simple
<BR>
circuit property from emerging&quot; (RP p. 132).  &quot;While necessary
<BR>
for long-term memory, [the hippocampus] is not likely to subserve
<BR>
it; rather, changes in cortical synapses probably serve this
<BR>
role&quot; (RP p. 139).
