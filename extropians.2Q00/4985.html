<P><EM>&gt;If I encountered the Waldemar Ingdahl of 10 years ago, I don't
</EM><BR>
think we would have very much to discuss.&lt; 
<BR>
<P>If I encountered my earlier self, I would have a flurry of questions
<BR>
to ask my former self.  I would have so much to talk about that
<BR>
somebody might have to intervene -:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The experiences and the knowledge I have had since then have
</EM><BR>
changed me and my outlook on life. I think that the younger Waldemar
<BR>
would have great difficulties following many of my arguments
<BR>
and thoughts.&lt;
<BR>
<P>This may be true, but your former self could learn from your
<BR>
current self, and visa versa -- that is if you knew who you were
<BR>
talking to.  If you had no clue that it was your former self,
<BR>
I can understand.  I might feel the same way, but I hope not.
<BR>
&nbsp;There is thread of essence, interests, humor and maybe some
<BR>
underlying values, but many of my values have changed, that would
<BR>
connect me to my former self, regardless of which one is smarter.
<BR>
<P>Each transition of character is as vital to the whole as the
<BR>
result of each pivot point.  If I discounted my entire former
<BR>
self as irrelevant, than this is precisely the behavior my future
<BR>
self would impinge on my current self.
