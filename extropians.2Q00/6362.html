<P><EM>&gt;Regarding the current hissy fit...
</EM><BR>
<P>No they don't make a trend .... (you need more data :-) )
<BR>
<P>However some possibly useful info to people viewing this list initially,
<BR>
is that the regular posters (say ~30) are a very small percentage of
<BR>
those that actually have signed up for the mailing list (~800).
<BR>
<P>And even then, there are a large number of extropian-types who
<BR>
don't, or rarely read/write to the list at all. I'm one of those who's
<BR>
been 'not-reading' more than 'reading' since I was first introduced
<BR>
to the extropians (people and the list) in the early 90's.
<BR>
<P>A mailing list like this one can be viewed as a dynamic structure,
<BR>
evolving and changing in time. The personalities shape it. Sometimes
<BR>
the more prolific writers and/or dominant personalities lend their own
<BR>
views to the email list in such a way to &quot;flavor&quot; it, to give it a
<BR>
certain appearance. But that will change too, as people do.
<BR>
<P>I see this list having quite a different personality than the
<BR>
one that I was actively a part of in the earlier 90s. That's fine.
<BR>
And I think that in order to grok the ideas of alot of what
<BR>
the extropians are and do, is to watch and compute the &quot;sum of
<BR>
the parts&quot;, or do a kind of Bayesian analysis for a long while.
<BR>
This list is really just a small part, and sometimes not the most
<BR>
accurate representation.
<BR>
<P>There will probably always be 'hissy fits' (Anyone remember the
<BR>
classic spats between Tim May and Eric Raymond?). Pretty uncomfortable
<BR>
for a lot of people but it's simply part of the larger realm of our
<BR>
social fabric.
