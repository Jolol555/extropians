<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm prepared to take

<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Eliezer's case far more seriously than, say, any of us (I assume) take the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Lorrey Drive, because its goal does not fly in the face of what we know to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; be true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a) How many times in your life has 'what we know to be true' been tossed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;window?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As far as I can recall, never (at the level of fundamental conservation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laws we're apparently talking here). Oh, maybe CP violation. Relativity and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; QT were already up and running when I was a kid, if only just. :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, Hawking showed that the event horizon of a black hole causes
<BR>
conservation violation by separating zero point fluctuation particles
<BR>
before they can recombine (which is why black holes eventually evaporate
<BR>
away).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;b) Considering that Prof. John Cramer of the U of W has stated that such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;device would work if the working mass were circulating at relativistic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;velocities (an opinion that Sasha Chislenko also held)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmm. Sorry, Mike, I don't know how to evaluate this statement, since I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never learned in any detail, or even any generality, how your Drive is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meant to function - aside from its apparent resemblance to a Dean Drive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (As I dimly recall, a request for details could not be met in the absence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of complicated non-disclosure documentation sent by mail, which I declined
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to provide on the grounds that life is too short.) Could you post some more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; details now?
</EM><BR>
<P>Essentially, Cramer has maintained that under Mach's Principle, a
<BR>
asymmetric centrifuge such as mine would not cause a surplus bias in
<BR>
centripetal force on a time averaged basis, EXCEPT in the even that the
<BR>
masses withing the centrifuge changed mass through the cycle as they
<BR>
sped up. I.E. if the masses are cycling in the 80-99% of light speed
<BR>
range, their mass increases as they increase in speed, so there will be
<BR>
a thrust produced in this case. Sasha felt the same way, so I accept
<BR>
that the drive WILL work under those conditions. I am, however
<BR>
interested in finding the lower boundaries of useful functionality, and
<BR>
I also wonder about what exact speed of light is being referred to. If,
<BR>
for example, your working mass in the centrifuge is a fluid that has an
<BR>
internal speed of light of a very low rate, say, less than 100 meters
<BR>
per second, could you move the fluid within your centrifuge at a speed
<BR>
that is equal to 90-99% of what light speed is within the fluid to
<BR>
attain this surplus thrust, or must you always measure this based on
<BR>
speed of light in a vacuum?
