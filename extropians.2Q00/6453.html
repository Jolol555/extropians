I was thinking about mid-tech artificial birth (artificial insemination, 
<BR>
artificial wombs) and the way it will effect human evolution. Overall, it 
<BR>
would be positive. I'm pretty sure that with genetic engineering, much of 
<BR>
this may be superceded by direct manipulation, but if genetic engineering 
<BR>
did not exist (and even if it's banned, how long will that last? A few 
<BR>
generations maximum), the technological changes going on in the world of 
<BR>
fertility medicine provide a lot of opportunity for Darwinian evolution. 
<BR>
Here's two I came up with which I thought were interesting, so I'm tossing 
<BR>
them out for discussion:
<BR>
- Although I am not aware of any particular progress towards this goal, it 
<BR>
makes perfect sense that soon, physical birth will be a thing of the past. 
<BR>
It's dangerous, takes up a lot of time and energy, and I hear that it really 
<BR>
hurts too. If I see a company which is making any progress towards womb-less 
<BR>
birth (via some kind of incubator), I'm going to invest my life savings. 
<BR>
What this means for human evolution is a massive increase in brain size. The 
<BR>
only thing limiting the brain size right now is the narrowness of the birth 
<BR>
canal. Intelligence is a valuable survival trait, and that's why it's 
<BR>
genetically worth the increase in childbirth deaths that humans experience. 
<BR>
It makes perfect Darwinian sense to assume that the death rate for 
<BR>
childbirth (meaning for the woman giving birth) and the size of the brain 
<BR>
are perfectly balanced for maximum benefit/minimum loss. When the 
<BR>
death-during-childbirth factor is removed, there's no limit on the size of 
<BR>
the brain. (OT: here's a great news story related to this topic: 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.theonion.com/onion3623/eight_pound_man.html">http://www.theonion.com/onion3623/eight_pound_man.html</A> ).
<BR>
- It is possible to seperate X-chromosome bearing sperm from Y-chromosome 
<BR>
bearing sperm in a test tube, thus making it possible to choose the gender 
<BR>
of your child (and I think it is even being practiced somewhat). In many 
<BR>
cultures, female children are not valued as much as men children. The fear 
<BR>
of this technology is based on the fact that it will skew gender populations 
<BR>
as almost everyone chooses to have male children. I would not expect this to 
<BR>
be widespread at least in US culture, although a 60/40 skew is not 
<BR>
unimagineable. In extreme male-supremecist cultures like that being endorsed 
<BR>
in Afghanistan, I would expect a 90/10 skew. The short term, social effects 
<BR>
of this would be bad. I'd expect to see an intensification of attitudes 
<BR>
which treat women as property. Long term and biologically, I'd expect to see 
<BR>
a general increase in any ability which has to do with survival, health, 
<BR>
wealth accumulation, and attracting a mate. The reason for this is that if 
<BR>
only 10% of the population were female, only 20% of the population would 
<BR>
breed. With the roughly 50/50 mix we have now, anyone who is fertile can 
<BR>
have a child. The &quot;most fit&quot; males and females hookup with eachother, as do 
<BR>
the &quot;least fit&quot; males and females. If only 11% of the male population was 
<BR>
breeding, the &quot;least fit&quot; 89% would be weeded out. In this case, whether 
<BR>
&quot;fit&quot; in the Darwinian sense correlates with good or desirable in the moral 
<BR>
sense is debatable.
