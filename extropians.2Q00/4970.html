<EM>&gt; Raises awareness of yet another threat to Immortality, what practical steps 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can we do to reduce this threat?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's tough because it's a classic &quot;public good&quot; problem.  Avoiding using
<BR>
antibiotics confers an advantage to everyone in society equally.  Worse,
<BR>
the advantage gained by one person not using antibiotic soap is really
<BR>
trivial, while the disadvantage is almost certainly larger.  (I know
<BR>
that there are many questions raised about the efficacy of antibiotic
<BR>
products, but I suspect that this is part of a public health campaign
<BR>
to discourage their use, and the information is probably being presented
<BR>
in a biased manner.)
<BR>
<P>The traditional solution is regulation, passing laws forbidding the use
<BR>
of antibiotics in products unless there is a demonstrated medical need.
<BR>
This is not very attractive for Extropians.
<BR>
<P>I think we do better to encourage aggressive research into biotech.
<BR>
The more we learn about how bacteria operate, the better the chances of
<BR>
coming up with a truly effective method of controlling harmful bacteria.
<BR>
<P>I understand that bacteria are biologically very different from the kinds
<BR>
of cells which make up our bodies.  We need to find something that can
<BR>
prevent them from reproducing without harming our cells, something so
<BR>
fundamental that they can't evolve away from it.  Hopefully, research
<BR>
will hit upon a &quot;magic bullet&quot; like this within the next few years.
