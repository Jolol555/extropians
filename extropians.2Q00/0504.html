<EM>&gt; &gt;Sure. How about we refrain from arguing about whether Windows is good or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;bad, or even whether MS is nice or not, and stick with the question of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;whether the government can do something to make things better by intervening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in the market?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That sounds very reasonable to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The basic problem that I see is that there is no real competition in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the i86 operating system market. Let's ignore how that situation came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be - I have nothing against Microsoft persay, I'm not interested in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; punitive damages - and talk about whether it's a bad thing and whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government intervention can do something constructive about it.
</EM><BR>
<P>And we all dispute your automatic and unproven assumption that there is
<BR>
no real competition. Your assertion that the market is the i86 market,
<BR>
as I have previously said, is also disengenuous, and typical of the big
<BR>
brother mindset of trying to control the debate by defining the terms
<BR>
beforehand. The market is the desktop personal computer market.
<BR>
Considering that the big three automakers are all changing over to
<BR>
linux, and windows is not certified for secure use in classified
<BR>
projects, most defense contractors that deal with such programs are also
<BR>
moving over to linux systems, and that most college users use Mac, as
<BR>
well as most all of the entire publishing industry, the claim that
<BR>
windows is a monopoly that stifles competition in the personal computer
<BR>
market is laughable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, obviously I think monopolization is a bad thing - so you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insert all those standard arguments here. What it really comes down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to, I think, is that control of the PC platform is too important to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trust to a single corporation: there's too much potential for abuse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and we loose the advantages of distributed economic optimization. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is an abstract compliant, not one specific to Microsoft. Perhaps you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't object to monopolization as strongly as I do, either because you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it's unstable or because it's a lesser evil than government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interference.
</EM><BR>
<P>Treating an operating system like a utility, where having a standard
<BR>
system provides for maximum benefit for all, according to the typical
<BR>
big brother/big government apologist, then an operating system monopoly
<BR>
should be to the best benefit of all. And hell, you trust your
<BR>
electricity to be provided by one company, your water and sewer are
<BR>
provided by one corporation. Your police services are provided by one
<BR>
corporation. A government is a corporation, and a monopoly one at that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There will never, without government intervention, be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementation of Windows offered by anyone other than Microsoft. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; API is too big and the target is moving too fast. Consider the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; failings of Win-OS/2, and the Wine project. Even putting aside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copyright issues, the propriety kernel ABI for instance, binary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compatibility with Windows is a pipe dream. The only way to compete is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to create something new - and here the barrier to entry is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; applications support. I'm not making any value judgments here - I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; object as strongly if OS/2 had dominated the market or if, one day,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux is in a similar position and turns to the dark side. It seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me that the OS market, by it's very nature, tends towards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monopolization. The resolution I see is insistence on public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standards.
</EM><BR>
<P>Saying that about linux just shows you have no idea what you are talking
<BR>
about. Because of the nature of how linux is managed in the world, it is
<BR>
virtually impossible for any one corporation to become a monopoly using
<BR>
linux. Because Linus put his OS under a public license, anyone who
<BR>
offers their own version must make all source code available to everyone
<BR>
else.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, then, what is are appropriate remedies? I'd like to see, as I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggested before, a prohibition against government itself purchasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software based on non-open standards. This minimally interferes with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the market - it doesn't place any restriction on what you can write,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buy or sell, and it doesn't specify what those standards might be or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how they are developed and controlled. It doesn't target Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specifically, it applies to all vendors and doesn't cripple one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competitor while artificially rewarding others. It doesn't place any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; restrictions on what private parties are allowed to do. Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be free to choose whether it opens it's specification and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provides the source for a reference implementation, develop a separate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; product to sell to government, or opt out of that particular market.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is also a really really dumb thing to do. Different parts of the
<BR>
government have different computing needs, and whether or not those
<BR>
needs are met by open or non open standards is irrelevant. If you want
<BR>
Windows to become open, fine, have your big brother government buy the
<BR>
operating system rights from Microsoft. Try and seize the rights by
<BR>
forcing MS to make it open is as blatantly an unpaid taking violation as
<BR>
one can imagine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd like to see a market where I don't buy an 'operating system,' I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buy a memory manager, a tasking subsystem, a file system, a desktop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment, etc, from independent vendors - and they all work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; together because they all conform to open standards; in the same way I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can purchase a nut and a bolt from two different manufactures because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they come in standard sizes. I go down a check list getting the pieces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that best suit my needs and my budget, or I just buy the whole thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from a system integrater. Now, I don't really think that this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible in practice, at least in a pure form, but it's the sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing I'd like to see us strive towards.
</EM><BR>
<P>You really don't know anything about programming, do you? Its 'possible'
<BR>
but this sort of thing puts such an incredible drain on innovation,
<BR>
because every new thing has to go through a standards body and get voted
<BR>
up or down by many different people, who all have competing interests,
<BR>
many of which are against yours. Is there any reason why HTML hasn't
<BR>
advanced for jack in the last few years? Too many freaking cooks in the
<BR>
pantry.
<BR>
<P>Bunch a socialist BS.
