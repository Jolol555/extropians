<EM>&gt; I'm getting to like Nevada more and more, and just wish that there was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someplace in the state that remained relatively cool in the summer. My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; body just doesn't beleive in the old 'but its a dry heat' claim...
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Northern Nevada (e.g. the greater Reno/Tahoe area) doesn't get that hot in
<BR>
the summer.  At my house, which is about 5,000 feet above sea level in the
<BR>
hills near Reno, it rarely hits 100 degrees (F) in the summer; I don't need
<BR>
my air conditioner.  Most people find the environment to be quite
<BR>
comfortable up here.
<BR>
<P>The dry heat really is much better.  For one, you don't sweat, and as
<BR>
long as you drink enough water, you don't feel hot.  I've spent quite a
<BR>
bit of time in the desert near Tucson, AZ when it's been 120 degrees in
<BR>
the shade.  Despite spending entire days doing moderate physical exercise
<BR>
in the open sun under those conditions (and loaded down with gear), I have
<BR>
always been quite comfortable, although I do consume copious amounts of
<BR>
water.  Northern Nevada is much cooler than this and the summers are
<BR>
generally very mild.
<BR>
<P>One thing that I do find interesting about the Reno area is that IP
<BR>
bandwidth is 10-20% cheaper than in Silicon Valley.  The number of
<BR>
providers is more limited, but PVCs or fiber access is actually
<BR>
significantly cheaper, which is not what I would expect.
