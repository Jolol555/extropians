<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;LA Times op-ed piece by Craig Venter and Daniel Cohen:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/news/comment/20000626/t000060554.html">http://www.latimes.com/news/comment/20000626/t000060554.html</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Putting wings on a man is a rather curious image to raise.  Apparently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the authors intend it to represent a risk of biotech, and in the context
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe they mean it to be a horrifying example of abuse.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is a flamboyant image though it is presented relatively quietly.  One
<BR>
gets the impression that they are not trying to be---as some are in their
<BR>
media profferings---overly provocative.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If adults could modify some of their cells to sprout wings as a form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; art or attire, it's hard to see why anyone other than die-hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conservatives would object strongly.  It's different only in degree from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tattoos, piercings, and other body modifications which have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practiced by human cultures.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd disagree with regard to potential objections.  There are already
<BR>
thousands of people ripping genetically-modified crops into pieces, furious
<BR>
that scientists have done some tinkering.  Some of the objections pertain
<BR>
to the overall safety of the resulting organisms, a quite reasonable
<BR>
concern.  But---whether or not it is always stated explicitly by such
<BR>
activists---for many, I think, a major objection is the mere fact that we
<BR>
have decided to do this at all, to, in their wearisome phrase, [play God].
<BR>
Opponents usually can't even see the differences in the organism and may
<BR>
rely more on political evidence than scientific.  Superficially genetic
<BR>
modification is different only in degree; but it will most likely not be
<BR>
received in the same way as putting some ink in your skin.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Science fiction readers are accustomed to depictions of healthy societies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with far more drastic variations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, most people haven't read any science fiction.  And it _is_ fiction,
<BR>
with no guarantee in the actual viability of the author's worldbuilding.
<BR>
<P>The most interesting thing is that they conclude with a proposal:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no universal system of ethical criteria that says, &quot;This is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good. This is possible, but it is bad, so don't do it.&quot; Now that we are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the threshold of the most fundamental knowledge man can attain of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his own being, such a universal system is imperative.
<BR>
<P>There is further [fundamental knowledge], like the structure of the human
<BR>
mind and minds in general.  Directly and precisely modifying that like
<BR>
software will truly be revolutionary.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we propose is the establishment of a kind of worldwide &quot;upper
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chamber of parliament&quot; for this purpose.
<BR>
<P>This sounds like a strange term with which to pitch the idea.  Why do I
<BR>
suspect that the first images many people (or at least Americans) will get
<BR>
are of stuffy, peruked men arguing behind large closed doors?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We mean a parliament in the sense of a deliberative body of experienced
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scientists and philosophers, let us say of 60 or so members, rotating
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in two-year terms to advise decision-makers in business and politics
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the weight of their collective authority. This body, perhaps under
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Nations auspices, would inform the public of what is at stake in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a given scientific advance and propose solutions.
<BR>
<P>What do you think about this?  The rotation/term limits should encourage
<BR>
flexibility but the obvious concern, aside from the general one of
<BR>
nonminimal intervention, is that such a body, while potentially able to
<BR>
fight certain real abuses, will prove conservative.  If the sign over the
<BR>
door says [Ye Olde House of Relinquishment] we're in trouble.
