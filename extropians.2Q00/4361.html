</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wonder what developments extropians would support as an alternative to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; central planning to address this issue.  These are some I see:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&gt; Natural &quot;Edge City Densification&quot;.  Here in Houston, we're seeing a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pattern of commercial real estate development at the nodes of the main
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highway system on the outskirts of town.  Houston is perhaps the most natural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Car Town&quot; on the planet, since its growth is not constrained by geography
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (except on the southeast side where the port makes a narrow radial entry into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the otherwise nearly perfect concentric-ring development pattern of the 20th
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Century city fed by radial freeway arteries and concentric ring roads).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Major groups of 5-25-story office buildings are being built at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intersection of the radial and ring freeways, &quot;seeding&quot; development of a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complete urban landscape at multiple locations as far out as 15-20 miles from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the city center.  These new nodes of conurbation seem to be acting as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;magnets&quot;, offsetting the otherwise steady centrifugal force of freeway-fed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; growth.  With no zoning laws (we've defeated them in three successive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plebiscites), this development in Houston is certainly not the result of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; central planning.
</EM><BR>
<P>As a resident of Atlanta I would say we are ahead of the curve here..
<BR>
the city has been sprawling out for many years now, and the the inter-
<BR>
sections of the major roads were overdeveloped and clogged with cars
<BR>
several years ago. Now you have people and the burbs spreading even
<BR>
farther out, with commutes of over an hour, and talk of building a
<BR>
second ring road farther out.
<BR>
<P>What you have then is a lot of people now moving back into the center
<BR>
of the city to try to escape the hellish commutes. Great for me since
<BR>
I own some lofts in midtown :-) But as for the traffic and pollution,
<BR>
the larger the sprawl, the worse it gets.
<BR>
<P>Somewhat interesting is that at least one large local company (Bellsouth)
<BR>
has decided to build all its new buildings very near to mass transit
<BR>
stations rather than the freeways. The hope is to get more employees
<BR>
using that and cut down on car trips.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&gt;  Telecommuting.  Talked about as a tonic to commuter gridlock for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decade, we OUGHT to be seeing an effect right about now as more and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people have sufficient bandwidth in their homes to work from there.  I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I have developed a pattern of working from home a few days a month and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to be encountering more anecdotal evidence of this trend as time goes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on.  But people still like the sociability of an office environment (I know I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do).  I'd look for the development of generic &quot;Edge City Workspaces&quot; for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; semi-telecommuting, where people with disparate professions could share an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; office space and some of the overhead of equipment and facilities (like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high-end videoconferencing) near their suburban homes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually this would be somewhat depersonalizing I think.. I have heard about
<BR>
companies (and even countries in general) where it isn't permitted to
<BR>
really personalize your workspace. If you had to use some generic space
<BR>
that might be a downside.
<BR>
<P>As for telecommuting from home, the bandwidth and more importantly the
<BR>
software to allow for people to work together in a simulated virtual
<BR>
space isn't there. Even if it was, would working from home be so great
<BR>
if you still had to get prepped and dressed up in order to do video
<BR>
conferencing and other interactive things with clients or coworkers?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&gt;  Electric/Hybrid Cars.  Long an electro-skeptic, I'm seeing electrics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially hybrids coming closer and closer to competitiveness.  Especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with smarter and smarter power-management systems and lighter and lighter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; materials, I'd look for the significant impact of electro-hybrids on urban
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hydrocarbon pollution within the next ten years.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep this will certainly help out with the pollution (although a similiar
<BR>
size chunk of our pollution comes from electrical power plants). But not
<BR>
with the traffic and sprawl :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&gt;  Smart Cars.  Although Gore supports &quot;smart highways&quot;, I think anyone with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much sense knows that this is a stalking horse for a major tax-and-spend orgy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the central planners.  It's not hard to imagine Gore's kind getting us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; committed to a huge &quot;National Smart Highway Initiative&quot; that would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obsolete before it's even begun.  However, a packet-switched system where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most of the smarts are in the cars DOES seem to offer promise for some relief
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from freeway congestion without losing the merits of individual choice in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mobility that Americans clearly prize very highly.  I'd be curious to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some pointers from anyone who is following this line of development closely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so we could make some intelligent guesses about how it might become a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant trend and how soon it might offer some relief to the weary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commuter.
</EM><BR>
<P>It requires a large amount of computing power and software to make a car
<BR>
smart enough to drive itself to a destination. In fact I would say it
<BR>
is still an unsolved problem. However if it could be fully developed
<BR>
then it could work since the software probably wouldn't cost that much
<BR>
per vehicle, and computing prices continue to drop. In the meantime a
<BR>
simpler system of magnets in roads and a little smarts in cars allowing
<BR>
them to track it would be nice... I would love to be able to get onto
<BR>
a clogged highway and then turn the car into &quot;auto&quot; mode until I got
<BR>
to my exit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure there are other trends and developments I'm overlooking.  Comments?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you can also look at delivery systems like Webvan, Kozmo, Amazon
<BR>
that are cutting down on the trips people have to make. I know that as a
<BR>
dweller in a clogged city I am glad to have these services.
<BR>
<P>Parts of Atlanta are also developing private shuttle systems. For instance
<BR>
in the very busy Buckhead area here (shopping and business center) they
<BR>
are planning to have one in place early next year to help people get
<BR>
around during the day without using their car. And we need it- we already
<BR>
have a lunch rush hour.
