<P>That was the point Spike.  There isn't any &quot;diamondoid&quot; in a rod-logic
<BR>
computer built out of hafnium carbide.  The M.P. of W is 3683 K, while
<BR>
HfC is solid up to 4163 K.  Now ~480K is a pretty wide margin if HfC
<BR>
doesn't lose too much rigidity as it approaches its M.P.
<BR>
<P>I've got the data for corundum (AL2O3) [1] and it has a linear decline in
<BR>
bulk modulus from ~260 GPa to 225 GPa from 400 to 1800 K (M.P. is 2345K).
<BR>
If HfC follows the same pattern, then it sould have a fair amount of
<BR>
strength left at 3700K.  If it turns out that HfC gets too soft, Be has
<BR>
a very wide liquidity range from 1551 to 3243 K, so it should do quite
<BR>
nicely as a general coolant.  You could get a really nice phase change
<BR>
coolant using liquid Be with Mo &quot;ice&quot; particles in it at around 2883K.
<BR>
<P>The rarity of Hf or Ta for HfC or TaC computers means that it is more
<BR>
likely that you would use TiC (3413K M.P.) or TiN (3203K M.P.) in which
<BR>
case beryllium might be in short supply, so switching to liquid Al, Si
<BR>
or Fe for a coolant migth be better.  Fe &quot;ice&quot; in liquid Al or Si is
<BR>
probably your most abundant coolant, but it only runs at 1808K.  :-(
<BR>
<P>Something I don't know (if you want to make yourself usefull... :-;)
<BR>
is what pressures would be required for a liquid carbon coolant.
