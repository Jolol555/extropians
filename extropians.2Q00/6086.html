<P><P>&quot;There's something to be said for considering the whole continent as home,
<BR>
and with a 'sickle you can get around in all the different places you stop.
<BR>
If it weren't for the time pressure of delivering loads ASAP, it would seem
<BR>
almost like being retired, like those people who drive all over the place in
<BR>
RV's.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Maybe that's it....i just can't see myself waking up EVERY morning and
<BR>
seeing the same old scenery.  (Right now i'm in Wendover Nevada...i just
<BR>
completed a liesurly &quot;stroll&quot; from Boise....tomorrow I wander on over to
<BR>
Toulee utah)
<BR>
<P>My loads don't get there ASAP...they get there when I get em there......I
<BR>
carry mostly &quot;high wide and heavy'.......(permit loads)......so I'm mostly
<BR>
solar powered (no night time driving)......and I have a whole host of other
<BR>
restrictions to contend with.  (of course....it pays better than chicken
<BR>
haulers too)....
<BR>
<P>So I pretty well go at my own pace......
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;Do you listen to books and music while you're driving?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Yup....I have a few....i prefer CD's...but mostly i just think a lot and
<BR>
listen to the whine of the turbo and the hum of the tires on the
<BR>
pavement....
