<P><EM>&gt; The quality I'm talking about has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  do with sensing the unexpected in the ordinary--for example, looking at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  clouds and seeing hundreds of different shade of white and at the same time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  hearing (in one's mind) all these shades of white translated into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  corresponding frequencies of sound; or listening to the rumbling of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  machine and suddenly hearing intensely beautiful music in the combination 
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  sounds and seeing (in the mind) the sounds translated into something like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  graphs of mathematical functions, weaving in and out of each other. 
</EM><BR>
<P>This sounds like (so to speak :-) synesthesia, where the
<BR>
mind experiences events of one sense in other senses
<BR>
simultaneously.  It's known of and gets a little study-
<BR>
I found 6 articles in the past 7 years on BIOSIS.
<BR>
One sounds related to your interest but is unfortunately
<BR>
in Italian.  The others are brain scans and such.

<P>Dogana, Fernando.  From synesthesia to expressive quality. Archivio di

Abstract:
<BR>
The article discusses the specific nature of synesthesia in 
<BR>
the context of intermodalmphenomena. It illustrates the 
<BR>
experimental research that has explored the characteristics 
<BR>
of thispeculiar perceptual process and debates the main 
<BR>
explanatory theories (from those based on learning, to those 
<BR>
implying some type of &quot;isomorphism&quot; between unrelated 
<BR>
sensorial modalities, up to explanations originating from 
<BR>
recent discoveries on the role of nervous system). The 
<BR>
Author's interest is also dedicated to the continuity between 
<BR>
synaesthetic phenomena and the &quot;expressive&quot; qualities that 
<BR>
are the main constituents of aesthetic experience. In 
<BR>
particular, the article illustrates the contribution given by 
<BR>
Prof. Girotti to this area of research.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The &quot;bipolar&quot; people I've known sometimes seem to see this way when they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in their manic phases.
</EM><BR>
<P>Never heard anything about bipolarity and synesthesia.  My understanding 
<BR>
(very limited) was that synesthesia was thought to be a rare, basically
<BR>
congenital condition.  Synesthetics (supposedly) tend *not* to agree on 
<BR>
what the induced perceptions are.  Hence it's thought to result from 
<BR>
idiosyncratic &quot;wiring defects&quot;, much like sneezing from sunlight (hmm - that 
<BR>
IS a synesthesia now that I think of it.  It really does feel like there's 
<BR>
something in my nose.)  Of course, the effects could be good or bad, not
<BR>
necessarily defective at all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Is there some practical use to be made of it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or is it something to be enjoyed mostly in silence 
</EM><BR>
<P>Several classical composers were synesthetic, although the only one I can
<BR>
think of is Alexander Scriabin.  Several developed color-note correspondence
<BR>
charts (which differ).
<BR>
<P>I think synesthesia is an obvious motivator for artistic pursuits.
