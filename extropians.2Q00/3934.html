The mention of Minsky choosing 2073 as A.I.'s arrival doesn't surprise me. Minsky has lived through several promised technological revolutions that seem to arrive at their own, slow, time. The question is, can we &quot;speed the plow&quot;? I would guess yes, only because there seem to be so many 'promising' areas to develop, in which Minsky is not an expert in.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I haven't read any reports on the Foresight Institute's confronting the

<EM>&gt;There were some no-shows including Minsky and Kurzweil.

<P>Minsky was on PBS recently - a panel on the future of the internet, as I 
<BR>
recall.  He now puts the Singularity - as far as real AI - at about 2073, to 
<BR>
my surprise.

<EM>&gt;The food was pretty good :-) San Francisco was cold, and had waaay worse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;traffic than last time I was there in 96.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's scary!  In '95 I got rear-ended - er, I mean my motorcycle got 
<BR>
rear-ended with me on it (you have to be clear about these things when 
<BR>
you're discussing San Francisco).  I suppose that's clear enough.  I have 
<BR>
yet to hear of people having sex with motorcycles - altho now I'm starting 
<BR>
to think maybe I shouldn't put the suggestion out there.
