<P>&lt;&lt; Thats primarily my concern. Anyone who calls themselves a scientist
<BR>
&nbsp;should have the integrity to acknowledge that a) the chances of it
<BR>
&nbsp;hitting earth were infinitesimal, b) if they did hit earth, they were
<BR>
&nbsp;designed to survive reentry and impact intact without leakage. His tv
<BR>
&nbsp;lobbying over that issue was disgusting and dishonest &gt;&gt;
<BR>
He was dishonest IF he could see beyond his own personal prejudices which 
<BR>
usually blind a person (all of us) into thinking beyond the current paradigm. 
<BR>
If he really knew better (had confidence in the reentry shielding 
<BR>
engineering) he might've given thought to changing his mind. Similarly, a lot 
<BR>
of the best scientists had a prejudice in Favor of uranium 235,BWR style 
<BR>
power plants, before the practical testing and evaluation had been performed. 
<BR>
Again its a matter of people discovering the truth and deciding what is 
<BR>
important.
