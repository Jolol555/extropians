<P>You're deliberately misrepresenting my statements (which in any event are
<BR>
not a comment on gun control, in either direction) about the unwisdom of 
<BR>
imposing mandatory draconian punishments.
<BR>
<P>Either that, or you didn't bother to pause and consider whether or not
<BR>
what you were reading meant what you thought it meant, or something else.
<BR>
<P>I repeat (in a nutshell): imposing harsher punishments doesn't necessarily
<BR>
reduce crime levels; it may actually impede the process of achieving a
<BR>
conviction. In general, crime rates go down when the perceived probability
<BR>
of conviction is high -- regardless of how serious the punishment is --
<BR>
because people only commit crimes *when they don't expect to get caught*.
<BR>
<P>It's no good legislating to hang people for stealing a loaf of bread if 
<BR>
you can't arrest anybody for the offense; bread thefts will continue
<BR>
because the perceived risk of arrest is zero. On the other hand, if the
<BR>
punishment is a fine of about twice the value of a loaf of bread, _but_
<BR>
there's a 95% arrest and conviction rate, only a total idiot would even
<BR>
consider stealing a loaf.
<BR>
<P>(Unfortunately the US legislative system seems currently to have a bias
<BR>
in favour of draconian punishment over reliable arrest and conviction.)
