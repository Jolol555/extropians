<EM> &gt;My wife and I, both, have read the information that you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;provided at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl04.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl04.shtml</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;It has been a great beginning of a new way of thinking and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;living for my entire family.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;In #TL04 one of a few referrences about parenting were:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;We humans are also born free. We are inherently and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;naturally free. But most parents break their children at an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;early age - turn them into broken-domesticated-obedient
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;little slaves. &quot;Teachers&quot; continue the process in compulsory
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;schools.&quot;&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;My question is, &quot;How do we raise our child to be a Free
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Sovereign Citizen and not be lawless without the common
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;'breaking' techniques such as spankings or other forms of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;punishments? I want my child to know who she is and to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;be free but I do not want her &quot;domesticated&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Some people are, in my view, &quot;politically domesticated&quot; on
<BR>
three levels:
<BR>
1. Surface beliefs -- people who are politically domesticated
<BR>
at this level believe that government is necessary to do all
<BR>
kinds of things like building roads, providing education, etc.
<BR>
Libertarians, anarchists, and other freedom lovers typically
<BR>
shed such surface beliefs. They become less politically
<BR>
domesticated.
<BR>
2. Action -- freedom lovers who are politically domesticated
<BR>
at this level generally believe that most or all of government
<BR>
is bad and unnecessary, yet they continue to act in many
<BR>
ways to support government, e.g., by working in corporations
<BR>
that support government, by paying taxes, sending their
<BR>
children to government schools, etc. As freedom lovers
<BR>
become even less politically domesticated they reduce
<BR>
their government-support actions and increase their
<BR>
freedom-promoting actions.
<BR>
3. Deep Beliefs -- freedom lovers who are politically domesticated
<BR>
at this level adhere to a deep &quot;semantic/thought structure&quot;
<BR>
which forms the foundation of statism. They continue to
<BR>
support statism at a deep intellectual level.
<BR>
<P>On the Natural Liberty list we will (among other things)
<BR>
discuss how children might be raised without domesticating
<BR>
them, but so they'll still be able to interact harmoniously
<BR>
with others (who are politically domesticated to various
<BR>
degrees).
<BR>
<P>We will also discuss how libertarians, anarchists, and other
<BR>
freedom lovers can advance, from whatever degree of political
<BR>
domestication, to complete Natural Liberty.
<BR>
<P>The Natural Liberty list was inspired by author Mack Tanner
