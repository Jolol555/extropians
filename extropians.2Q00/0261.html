<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Just a theory, but maybe...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;* In order to effectively use these technologies, one must acquire a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   lot of knowledge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;* In the process of acquiring said knowledge, people typically learn of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   ways to solve problems better (cheaper/faster/more effective) than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   violence and mass slaughter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; My theory: R-E-T-A-L-I-A-T-I-O-N
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you imagine the vengence which would be unleashed on some penny-ante
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; tyrant if he unleashed a biotech attack on the US or its close allies?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; KA-friggin-BOOM brother!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;What about terrorists, mail bombers, and general nutcases?  Retaliation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;isn't a big issue for them - they already face death if caught, and it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;hard to imagine a bigger manhunt than the ones they already trigger with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;spectacular conventional attacks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Right.  Which leads me to believe that your average terrorists, mail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bombers, and general nutcases do not have access to this technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Otherwise they'd use it.
</EM><BR>
<P>The idea that a Luddite would use NBC type technology is laughable, the idea
<BR>
that they would use nanotech is ludicrous. Gives em the heebie jeebies so much
<BR>
you won't get them near it. Ted Kazinski, for example, purposely made his bombs
<BR>
as simple as possible, and were treasures of 'found art' in that he hacked them
<BR>
together from odds and ends, and built them into wooden boxes.
<BR>
Also keep in mind what the targets of such terrorism are: governments.
<BR>
Terrorists would not have anyone to make demands of in a society which is
<BR>
ungoverned, who do they send their manifesto to? They have to send it to as many
<BR>
people as possible, right? In such a decentralized society, where people would
<BR>
be used to taking care of themselves, how long do you think such a person would
<BR>
last on the street? Leaving it up to the market to determine countermeasures is
<BR>
the solution, however the ability of corporations to avoid paying for
<BR>
externalities needs to be addressed.
