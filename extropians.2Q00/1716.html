<EM>&gt;     John, I spent my career in manufacturing and I thought everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understood how automation worked.  You probably do know but for the benefit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the others the rule is &quot;Automate and layoff one production worker then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hire two maintenance men.&quot; :))
</EM><BR>
<P>I doubt this very much. If it were so, the unions would be all over automation,
<BR>
demanding that the big three automate all plants as quickly as possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     During the days I was doing management consulting in manufacturing I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; told that studies show that the companies that are buy &quot;labor saving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equipment&quot; end up hiring even more workers.  If there is any net layoff at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all it is over at their competitors plants; not theirs.
</EM><BR>
<P>And how many years ago was this?
<BR>
<P>One industry where this has been shown to be totally false is in the shipping
<BR>
industry. The USPS, for example, even though it has union employees, has
<BR>
basically rolled over the unions on a regular basis, and installed a highly
<BR>
automated system for sorting and distributing mail, which is why it has the
<BR>
lowest rates in the industry. There are quality issues, but from what a good
<BR>
freind of mine who is a postal union president says, the quality issues are
<BR>
almost completely a matter of human factors. He readily admits that a large
<BR>
chunk of postal workers are mental driftwood and barely manageable. The
<BR>
employees abuse the greivance process on things so stupid and inane that you'd
<BR>
think you were dealing with the sort of frivolous court cases prison convicts
<BR>
typically spend their time pursuing to mess up the court system. The USPS posted
<BR>
a $1 billion profit last year, BTW....
