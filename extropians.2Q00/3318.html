<P><EM>&gt; I've asked this question twice before of Harvey Newstrom and received

<EM>&gt; insults and invocations of the all powerful &quot;s&quot; word but no answer,
</EM><BR>
perhaps
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the third time is the charm.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sorry that you feel insulted.  That certainly was not my intent.
<BR>
However, I apologize for any discomfort or inconvenience.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Question: I've been making and destroying a billion Harvey Newstroms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every second since you were a one celled zygote, so you tell me, who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the original Harvey Newstrom?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; What part of my answer did you not understand?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think it was the part where you tell me who is the original Harvey
</EM><BR>
Newstrom.
<BR>
<P>Here are my pervious answers.
<BR>
<P>I wrote on Tuesday, May 16, 2000 4:08 PM,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Where did you get the plan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for building a Harvey Newstrom?  From the original.  Every copy of Harvey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Newstrom was generated from a pre-existing copy, except for one.  There
</EM><BR>
was
<BR>
<EM>&gt; once an original that was produced the old-fashioned way.
</EM><BR>

<BR>
<EM>&gt; The thing that you copy *from* is the original.  The thing you copy *to*
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; not the original.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wrote on Thursday, May 18, 2000 9:52 AM:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; What part of my answer did you not understand?  If you made the copies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't you know which was the copy source and which as the copy
</EM><BR>
destination?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; How can you copy something if you can't tell which is which?  What keeps
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; from copying the blank page into the original data?  Why do you keep
</EM><BR>
asking
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the same question again without referencing any of the preceding answers?
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me try to answer once again.
<BR>
<P>Go backwards in time until you reach a time when there is only one Harvey
<BR>
Newstrom.  This is the original.
<BR>
<P>Or, look at the data flowing in the Harvey Newstrom copy machine.  The
<BR>
direction of the data flow indicates the original.  Data flows from the
<BR>
original to the copy.
<BR>
<P>Or, look at the peripheral devices on the Harvey Newstrom copy machine.  The
<BR>
person under the scanner/reader is the original.  The person under the nano
<BR>
assembler is the copy.
<BR>
<P>Or, look at the persons in a destructive copy machine.  The body that is
<BR>
being disassembled atom by atom is the original.  The body that is being
<BR>
assembled atom by atom is the copy.
<BR>
<P>Or, look at the self-check mechanism of a copy process.  It compares the
<BR>
copy to the original to see if the copy was completed successfully.  The
<BR>
body that is considered to be definitively correct is the original.  The
<BR>
body that is compared and corrected if it deviates is the copy.
<BR>
<P>Here are some questions for you, to help me understand why you aren't
<BR>
perceiving my answer as an answer:
<BR>
<P>Do you seriously not understand who I consider to be the original, or do you
<BR>
merely disagree with me?  Do you not understand what I am saying, or do you
<BR>
merely not understand why I say it?  Do you disagree with all dictionaries
<BR>
and usage of the term &quot;original&quot;, or do you merely disagree with some
<BR>
specialized way that I am using the term?  Do you disagree that there is
<BR>
only one Harvey Newstrom right now and that he is the original by default,
<BR>
or do you merely disagree that there are originals in your theoretical
<BR>
examples?
<BR>
<P>I seriously don't know how to explain the concept of &quot;the original Harvey
<BR>
Newstrom&quot; to you without further information from you.  You do not seem to
<BR>
disagree with my answer, but refuse to acknowledge that I have answered.
<BR>
You do not seem to disagree with my definition of the &quot;original&quot;, but refuse
<BR>
to acknowledge that an original ever existed.
