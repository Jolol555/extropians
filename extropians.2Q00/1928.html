<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Being in love is already such an overwhelming experience!  And to not have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that love returned while sensing it never will, is to be in a mental state 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of PURE HELL.  To be in agony over a failed romantic venture, and have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;medication to greatly lessen the emotional pain(not alcohol!) would be a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;boon for humanity.  For some it takes many months or even years to get over 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;heartbreak, and some individuals never truly get over it.  The emotional 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;agony of heartbreak can interfere will all the other areas of that persons 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't believe there's anything noble about pain - the idea that suffering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; builds character is horribly patronizing and unkind - but there's something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creepy as hell about the idea of popping a pill to take away the pain of lost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; love. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I have to admit that I'm a better writer than I was a few years ago
<BR>
in large part due to additional experience with the more painful parts of
<BR>
human experience.  And writing well is one of the experiences that brings
<BR>
me the most pleasure.  I do feel that there is some truth to the old
<BR>
cliche that one can experience the positive only to the extent that one
<BR>
has some experience with the negative.
<BR>
<P>Of course, one could just pop a pill to *experience* the pain of lost
<BR>
love, and another when you felt you'd developed sufficient
<BR>
character!  Creepy?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Surely love is a chemical state, some dopamine regulated attachment response. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What about inventing a pill that fakes it? Two lonely people with nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular in common could agree to be imprinted upon each other. Rather than a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dating service, you just swing by a clinic and get hooked up with some other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lonely heart. The cognitive aspects would follow from the chemistry - it doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter how revolting you'd otherwise find each other, once you've been treated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you hallucinate your true love's perfection as usual.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I know plenty of incompatible people who've fallen in love anyway.  They
<BR>
make each other miserable.  
<BR>
<P>I do like the devices that are being prototyped now--the beeper-style
<BR>
devices that encode personality preferences and let you know when a
<BR>
compatible person with another beeper comes nearby.  Gets past the initial
<BR>
unfairness of purely physical scans.
