Dear Bonnie,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome!  I've been on this list for about 2 years or so and I don't 
<BR>
think I ever bothered to really introduce myself and although I have always 
<BR>
been fascinates with all the topics on the list most of my posts have always 
<BR>
been playful sarcasm or just lightening the mood.  Some may remember me from 
<BR>
my first screen name on the list which was CloningEwe and I have also been on 
<BR>
as MonketProphet but for those of you who don't really have any idea who I am 
<BR>
or anything about me...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Eric Peterson, I live in Connecticut, I am a physical Trainer 
<BR>
in a gym and I also work for Save the Sound (an environmental group but they 
<BR>
are *not* extremists) I've been studying different fields of Science 
<BR>
Philosophy and World Religions very intensely since I was 18 and came to the 
<BR>
conclusion that our purpose behind religion is a deep seeded destiny to 
<BR>
achieve human immortality.  I got on this list when I saw a week long 
<BR>
Documentary on The Learning Channel called FUTURE FANTASTIC.  At present I'm 
<BR>
trying to set up a Connecticut chapter of the Mars Society so if there is 
<BR>
anyone on the list that is interested in helping out please Email me.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK I don't want to bore anyone I just thought that it would only be 
<BR>
appropriate to give myself a formal introduction and Bonnie provided the 
<BR>
perfect opportunity for which I thank her.  
<BR>
<P>My Best To all, Eric Peterson
