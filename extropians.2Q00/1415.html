<P><EM>&gt; One other thing weirds people over here out about the US; it's the 
</EM><BR>
assumption
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  that natural rights exist. But that's another matter. (In general, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  are two concepts of rights. One is that 'nature' somehow assigns certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rights to human beings, and those rights exist almost in a platonic sense;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  they're real things and you can't abolish or add to them. Another 
</EM><BR>
philosophy
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  of rights is that rights are an emergent phenomenon, that comes from people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  behaving towards each other as they themselves would like to be dealt with;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  your right to life is the corollary of my refraining from killing you. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  view of rights is that they're all essentially social constructs, and while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  they're desirable and necessary they're in no way automatic.)
</EM><BR>
<P>My (emerging and evolving) view of rights might be seen as a third 
<BR>
alternative, synthesized from these two.  I don't see rights as having some 
<BR>
platonic or supernatural &quot;reality&quot;, but I think they are by no means 
<BR>
arbitrary social constructs and therefore may well be seen to be &quot;automatic&quot; 
<BR>
in the sense you seem to use the word above.  In my view, rights ARE an 
<BR>
emergent phenomenon, but they are inherent in the fabric of social 
<BR>
interaction.  Thus certain fundamental principles of liberty and autonomy, as 
<BR>
well as some aspects of &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;transparency&quot; are aspects of any 
<BR>
creative and satisfying social order.  It's obviously possible to create 
<BR>
human social orders which thwart these rights, just as its possible to design 
<BR>
and build an engine that has high friction and low energy efficiency.  But a 
<BR>
study of society will INEVITABLY lead to such a high valuation of liberty, 
<BR>
individual autonomy, fairness and transparency that we will come to value 
<BR>
them as &quot;rights&quot;, just as a study of mechanics will cause us to value low 
<BR>
friction and energy efficiency as fundamental design values.
