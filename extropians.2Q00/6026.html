<P>
Houston is an interesting city in many ways.  (I grew up there, and my
<BR>
parents still live there, so I go to visit from time to time)  Last time I
<BR>
thought to ask about it, there were no zoning ordinances. I wonder if this
<BR>
is still the case.
<BR>
<P>We lived in a neighborhood called Tanglewood, and there were deed
<BR>
restrictions and neighborhood agreements which called for things such as
<BR>
minimum square footage of buildings, single family residential use only,
<BR>
types of building materials, and so forth.  But I could ride my bike not too
<BR>
far and find myself in completely different surroundings.
<BR>
<P>One of my favorite places to go was the Fifth Ward where there were very old
<BR>
weather-beaten wooden houses built right down to the street, and little old
<BR>
ladies would spend their early morning hours sweeping the sidewalk and
<BR>
street outside their houses, and old men sat on the front porches just
<BR>
watching the sun move the shadows around.  They'd all be talking to each
<BR>
other, and they'd stop what they were doing to smile and say hello to me
<BR>
when I pedaled by--so unlike my own neighborhood where everyone stayed
<BR>
inside of tightly closed airconditioned houses which were isolated from each
<BR>
other by wide expanses of uninhabited lawn.  The air often smelled of coffee
<BR>
(to this day I don't know if there was a coffee packing plant somewhere, or
<BR>
if some industrial process gave off a coffee-like fragrance), sometimes of
<BR>
oil refineries if the wind was blowing in from Pasadena.
<BR>
<P>Houston was filled with unexpected delights. You could be walking along a
<BR>
cracked sidewalk past flat dirty-white walls with small, uninteresting
<BR>
windows and suddenly come upon an archway.  If you didn't mind going where
<BR>
you weren't s'posed to go, you could pass through the archway and find
<BR>
yourself in a courtyard with a hipped-style roof of steel beams and glass
<BR>
and a huge fountain in the middle, apartments meeting at surprising
<BR>
non-90-degree angles, peeling cobalt blue paint, peeling red paint,
<BR>
extravagant tropical plants. (many years later,I saw this amazing place
<BR>
again in the pages of _Architectural Digest_ or some such publication.
<BR>
Someone had bought it and restored it)
<BR>
<P>My best friend's grandmother lived in an austere old mansion in River Oaks.
<BR>
You could get up from the Sunday-dinner table with its delicate china and
<BR>
smooth linen and the button on the floor for calling the servants with your
<BR>
foot, and you could walk a short distance down to the bayou and find there
<BR>
dying pigeons, struggling to fly on oil-soaked wings and rainbows of oil
<BR>
slick swirling around your bare feet, and someone's artificial leg caught in
<BR>
the bushes (where was the rest of the body? you'd wonder).
<BR>
<P>And then you could find places, right in the middle of town, where you could
<BR>
lie down in tall, unkempt grass and look up at the sky and hear the song of
<BR>
the field lark (that song still makes me shiver with joy whenever I hear it,
<BR>
which isn't too often since that particular bird doesn't live where I am
<BR>
now), and the constant hum of traffic would be soothing, like maybe a
<BR>
mother's heart beat to a fetus.
<BR>
<P>I think growing up in a place like Houston definitely gives greater scope to
<BR>
a person's thoughts.

<EM>&gt; Subject: SOC: Immigration (Was: crime in big cities and Europe)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Immigration policy is one area that exposure to well-presented
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libertarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas has had an effect on my thinking over the last ten years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I live in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of the most ethnically heterogeneous cities in the US (perhaps in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world) and I see signs of the vitality this &quot;people gumbo&quot; brings to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; community everywhere.  Many of these immigrants in Houston are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illegal under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US law.  They all seem to be working hard and contributing to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; progress of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the area.  Yes, if we opened the borders entirely we'd probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be swamped by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economic refugees beyond the ability of our infrastructure to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respond.  But I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think we could steadily increase the permeability of our borders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintain our prosperity.
