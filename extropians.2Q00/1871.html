In his very interesting editorial &lt;Tensions on the Net, 4/24/00&gt; 
<BR>
Mortimer B. Zuckerman, Editor-in-Chief of U.S. News, wrote: 
<BR>
America exults in its dominance of the emerging digital economy 
<BR>
that will not only transform our domestic economy and society but 
<BR>
profoundly affect our relations with the rest of the world. 
<BR>
Resentment of American ascendancy is already apparent in the 
<BR>
perennial resistance to the export of American popular culture and 
<BR>
newer objections to American political and military dominance. 
<BR>
Anti-Americanism is sure to intensify when more businesses in 
<BR>
other countries experience the hollowing-out effects of the 
<BR>
acceleration of foreign-market penetration by American 
<BR>
E-commerce. Even sovereign states will not be immune, for their 
<BR>
national tax revenues and their currencies will be vulnerable to the 
<BR>
unique nature of the global E-economy. This may strike some as 
<BR>
overstatement, even given the manifest speed of E-commerce 
<BR>
growth. Yet just a few years ago no one foresaw the spread of 
<BR>
E-commerce and no one talked about the possibility that the 
<BR>
Internet might become the major worldwide distribution channel 
<BR>
for goods and services that it promises to be.
<BR>
There are areas where European countries lead. European 
<BR>
technology producers have an advantage in wireless broadband, a 
<BR>
platform that may well emerge as the dominant technology in the 
<BR>
next few years. The European notion is that the mobile telephone 
<BR>
rather than the personal computer is poised to become the 
<BR>
principal tool for communicating and transacting. But the first 
<BR>
round goes to U.S. producers, and the rest of the world remains 
<BR>
years behind. The American model has now become the world 
<BR>
standard, and this standard will dominate at least for the next 
<BR>
several years. We certainly lead the world in building the new 
<BR>
infrastructure of the information age. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
<BR>
analyzed the 46 leading suppliers of the infrastructure of the digital 
<BR>
economy that were considered to have a competitive advantage
<BR>
&nbsp;are American; only four 
<BR>
are European. Altogether the pressure on other businesses, other 
<BR>
societies, and other economies is going to be enormous. 
<BR>
European and Japanese companies in industry after industry will 
<BR>
find themselves at a growing disadvantage vis-à-vis American 
<BR>
companies. 
<BR>
That is not all. The impact on national economies will be 
<BR>
substantial. Three areas where growing American predominance 
<BR>
will be felt are currencies, trade, and balance of payments. The 
<BR>
United States will benefit from the long-term IT trade surplus; it will 
<BR>
benefit from the dramatic growth of U.S. exports of intellectual 
<BR>
property rights, namely royalties and fees that have now emerged 
<BR>
as the largest component of U.S. exports; and it will benefit from 
<BR>
the continued strong export growth in a number of 
<BR>
technology-intensive service activities, especially computer data 
<BR>
processing and database services. These trends will strengthen 
<BR>
the American dollar and weaken other currencies over the long 
<BR>
haul.
<BR>
Other national consequences will follow. The Internet will have 
<BR>
such a transforming effect on business models that it will divert 
<BR>
profitable activities from European and Japanese companies to 
<BR>
American companies, and extend the reach of American 
<BR>
companies, in an unprecedented way, into the service sector of 
<BR>
foreign economies. This will inflict a loss of profits on the foreign 
<BR>
companies, which in turn will reduce tax revenues collected by 
<BR>
governments. The fiscal effect will be compounded by the fact that 
<BR>
the Internet is a borderless technology that makes physical 
<BR>
location virtually irrelevant. This creates the incentive to shift 
<BR>
business activities to the lowest tax regimes. Companies may be 
<BR>
physically farther away from their customers, even though they are 
<BR>
only a mouse click away. 
<BR>
No developed country is going to sit back and allow its fiscal 
<BR>
revenues to erode. American firms will be seen as the cause of 
<BR>
these declines, and the governments will be lobbied by 
<BR>
businesses on the losing en
<BR>
ine their doing anything that makes economic sense. But that 
<BR>
won't stop the attempts and the subsequent strain in relations 
<BR>
between America and the rest of the world.
<BR>
<P>In my opinion M.B. Zuckerman is right but that new 
<BR>
anti-americanism is not yet started (in EU), because we live, just 
<BR>
now, a sort of honeymoon, with the net. 
<BR>
<P>What about the future? Will anti-americanism be a temporary 
<BR>
problem or a real, definitive question?
