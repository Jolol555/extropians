<EM>&gt; &gt; Not so. Foreign companies cannot have anti-trust actions brought against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them, only US based companies can be charged with such 'crimes'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Uh-huh. Then the EU anti-trust investigation into Microsoft must be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imaginary, right?
</EM><BR>
<P>Microsoft's european operations can probably be investigated, but the EU has no
<BR>
extraterritorial authority, esp re a US corp. They can certainly regulate MS's
<BR>
business practices in europe if they so choose, but they certainly cannot impose
<BR>
any remedies upon MS corporation proper.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most other countries have _tougher_ anti-trust laws than the US. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EU and the DOJ had a &quot;gentleman's agreement&quot; not to duplicate effort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while one of 'em was investigating -- now that MS has been found guilty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the US, the EU investigation is rolling ahead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Oh, and then there's the French investigation. _That_ one is dynamite --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the charges are extremely serious and typically carry prison sentences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the directors of companies found guilty under them, because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; French charges aren't about anti-trust -- they're anti-FRAUD, and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allege that Microsoft defrauded the French government. Oops ...)
</EM><BR>
<P>Extra-territoriality again. They gonna send the Foreign Legion into the US to
<BR>
arrest Bill Gates?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Especially if MS has no actual offices left here, they are merely an OEM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; supplier to PC makers and software distributors, or they just distribute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; over the ineternet. Foreign traders can only be charged with anti-trust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; crimes if they are American citizens or American based corporations, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the American based divisions of foreign corporations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft occupies a similar monopoly position in the rest of the world,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if not a tighter one -- and typically charges more for its software.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hardly. China, for example, the communist party bosses who have been pirating so
<BR>
much MS software control a greater monopoly position in the chinese software
<BR>
market than MS does. Just because the market uses MS software that is pirated
<BR>
doesn't mean you can say MS monopolizes the market.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Now, Bill would be dumb to fire all of his employees, however buying an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; island and developing it for use by as many of his current employees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that want to move there, then simply subcontract the rest who want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stay in Redmond, would be rather easy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And put him outside NAFTA and the EU, making him vulnerable to import
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; duty and other taxes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which under GATT are nothing.
