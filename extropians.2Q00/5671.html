<P>Here in the US, the Supreme Court and the apellate courts have
<BR>
repeatedly ruled that police and other government agencies or officials
<BR>
are not authorized, responsible, or liable for the protection of any
<BR>
individual person. Their job is to show up after the crime has been
<BR>
reported, investigate the crime scene, question witnesses, arrange
<BR>
medical care for any victims or perpetrators still living (but not to
<BR>
pay for it), and attempt to figure out, apprehend, and bring to trial
<BR>
whoever was at fault in the incidents. If they stop a crime during its
<BR>
commission, that is merely an unexpected bonus for the average citizen,
<BR>
not something they should expect, and only serves to a) provide
<BR>
eyewitness testimony by policemen as to the guilt of the perpetrators,
<BR>
and b) ensure that as many victims and witnesses are alive to testify as
<BR>
possible.
