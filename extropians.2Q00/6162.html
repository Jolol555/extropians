PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
<BR>
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
<BR>
Number 490 June 22, 2000   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein
<BR>
<P>ATOMIC SCALE LOCOMOTIVES.  Miniaturization has
<BR>
produced several examples of nm-sized rotors, ratchets, and gears,
<BR>
but not yet nano-steam engines.  But to move raw materials around
<BR>
the freight yards of future nano-factories one needs nano-
<BR>
locomotives.  Scientists at Tel Aviv University in Israel (Markus
<BR>
Porto, 011-972-3-640-7229),  have proposed how this can be done. 
<BR>
In their scheme the freight yard consists of a lithographically
<BR>
prepared corrugated surface, something like the shape of an egg
<BR>
carton (on the microscopic level, anyway; to the naked eye the
<BR>
surface looks flat).  The engine, in its simplest form, consists of
<BR>
three tiny clusters of metal atoms connected by two &quot;springs.&quot; 
<BR>
Each spring is actually a photochromophore molecule, one whose
<BR>
length can be expanded or shrunk with light.  So to get the engine
<BR>
to move, laser light is shot in from above, the molecule expands,
<BR>
and one metal particle moves into depression on the surface.  By
<BR>
careful timing and correlating of the light pulses, the engine can be
<BR>
made to move along like an inchworm (see movie at
<BR>
www.aip.org/physnews/graphics).  Cargo consisting of, say,
<BR>
inactive chains of molecules or other atomic material would be
<BR>
coupled to the locomotive and transported to where it is needed.

<BR>
<P>NM-RESOLUTION VISIBLE-LIGHT MICROSCOPY, of a sort,
<BR>
has been accomplished by scientists at the Max Planck Institute for
<BR>
Biophysical Chemistry in Gottingen, Germany (Stefan Hell,  011-
<BR>
49-551-201-1366, <A HREF="mailto:shell@gwdg.de?Subject=Re:%20NANO:%20A%20coule%20of%20nice%20developments&In-Reply-To=&lt;3f.69c2419.26879605@aol.com&gt;">shell@gwdg.de</A>).  The diffraction of light waves
<BR>
normally limits spatial resolution of nearby objects to no better
<BR>
than the wavelength of the light source.  So called near-field
<BR>
microscopy beats this limit by moving the source very close to the
<BR>
subject to be imaged.  But the Gottingen group, whose work is an
<BR>
example of far-field microscopy, in this case does not so much
<BR>
beat the diffraction limit as circumvent it.  They split a laser pulse
<BR>
(wavelength of 820 nm) into two parts and illuminate a sample
<BR>
consisting of beads attached to a
<BR>
Langmuir-Blodgett layer, the kind of filmlike layer of water-hating
<BR>
and water-attracting molecules poised back-to-back that forms the
<BR>
membrane of most cells.  The sample, positioned close to the place
<BR>
where the two laser beams meet at the same focal point of two
<BR>
lenses, starts to fluoresce.  This fluorescence is viewed through
<BR>
filters at two different colors.  This &quot;confocal&quot; microscopy does
<BR>
not exactly &quot;resolve&quot; the objects apart but does measure the
<BR>
distance between them with a precision as high as 1.2 nm.  For the
<BR>
process to work, however, the contrasting objects, in this case the
<BR>
layer and a bead, must fluoresce at different colors.  This is just
<BR>
what one gets when attempting the co-localization of proteins and
<BR>
organelles or vesicles and membranes, etc.  And unlike such
<BR>
imaging techniques as atomic force microscopy (AFM) or
<BR>
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the use of non-bleaching
<BR>
visible light permits the study of living cells.  (Schmidt et al.,
<BR>
Review of Scientific Instruments, July 2000; Select Article.)
