<EM>&gt; &gt; I know Lee Daniel probably did not intend it as an insult to anyone, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; most people are going to take it that way.  Better instead to avoid such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; words where possible if, indeed, you want to discourse with others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Avoid&quot; words?  How horrific!  Words are there to be used; all of them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Avoiding words is tantamount to avoiding thought: putting blinders on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one's mind, communicating in a straitjacket.  If words have bad side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effects, then we should work on repairing those side effects, not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; words.  If &quot;offensiveness&quot; gets in the way of communication, then let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us fight it--but &quot;offense&quot; exists in the listener's mind only, not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speaker's, and that's where it has to be fought.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tolerance is an obligation of listeners, not speakers.  A speaker's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only obligation is honesty.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well said, but words like &quot;stupid&quot; connote something that other, more
<BR>
neutral terms merely denote.  It's like the difference between calling
<BR>
someone &quot;poor&quot; or saying she's &quot;disadvantaged.&quot;  The former, despite having
<BR>
some emotional ties, does not really connote more than someone's
<BR>
financial/wealth status.  The latter does that, but it also sneaks in the
<BR>
notion that there's some unfairness involved -- i.e., that she's poor
<BR>
because others (the advantaged) are not.
<BR>
<P>Also, Lee Daniel must be speaking to someone else.  I merely wrote what is
<BR>
quoted above and not much more.  I did not, e.g., bring the word &quot;tolerance&quot;
<BR>
or &quot;offensive&quot; in here.  Reread my post if you do not believe me.  To be
<BR>
&quot;honest&quot; by Lee Daniel's usage, this is the kind of _stupidity_ that
<BR>
typifies a lot of posts on this list.  They [the posters] argue past each
<BR>
other and respond, knee-jerk-like, to what they feel the other person wrote
<BR>
rather than what she or he actually wrote.
<BR>
<P>I specifically avoided tolerance because that issue does not arise here --
<BR>
unless someone is prepared to censor material or otherwise edit content.
<BR>
(Which would include DoS attacks.)  Since the owner of the list allows it, I
<BR>
take it that whatever is said here is tolerated.
<BR>
<P>Penultimately, as you (plural) might have noticed, I usually stay out of
<BR>
these sorts of debates.  Why?  They go nowhere.  At the end of this little
<BR>
thread, who will have changed?  Lee Daniel?  QueenMuse?  Anyone?  Surely,
<BR>
we'll be honest about how we feel and what we think, but so what?  The
<BR>
cosmos will grind on anyhow.:)
<BR>
<P>Finally, with all that said, I'm by no means claiming that Lee Daniel is
<BR>
stupid.:)
