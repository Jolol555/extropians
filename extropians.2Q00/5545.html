<BR>
<EM>&gt; I didn't know we lived in a oppressive society? A question: since Europeans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live in an oppressive society and legal system, how come we never riot as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it happens in LA? No racism?
</EM><BR>
<P>Never riot?  Perhaps there are Europeans, and Europeans.  When I lived in
<BR>
Zurich, I saw a very nice, full-out riot in the center of the city - complete
<BR>
with broken windows up and down the Bahnhofstrasse, riot police, looting, and
<BR>
anything else you might want.  I also saw skinhead attacks more than once,
<BR>
and quite blatant police brutality numerous times.  I actually became more
<BR>
concerned for my safety walking around there sometimes than I am home in
<BR>
NYC - because in Zurich, I found I wasn't able to accurately sense that a
<BR>
situation was becoming dangerous - the violent things I saw happen seemed
<BR>
to come out of nowhere.
<BR>
<P>I've seen riots in several places - yes, mostly in the US, but Europeans
<BR>
can do a good job of it too.
