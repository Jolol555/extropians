<EM>&gt; &gt; But then, where would you get the device?  I suspect most of the people

<EM>&gt; &gt; Russia's warheads.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I note you only go so far as to say 'most'. :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh-huh.  Those who blaze the trail to a better life that others
<BR>
eventually follow, profit from having arrived at the destination while
<BR>
most of humanity catches up.  We are no exception.  But I do not know to
<BR>
what degree the average profit shows up in various forms, including
<BR>
what portion is monetary.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Besides, I never suggested it should be one of us who attempts this,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only that it might be an interesting exercise.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;nods&gt;  True.  It's nice to think about, but even if I had the money to
<BR>
do this myself, I've got more effective ways to invest it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And anyway, what would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really polish off the job would be to build the bomb yourself...
</EM><BR>
<P>One could build it if one had the materials - the plans are easy enough
<BR>
to get, and there are ways of deducing the critical mass of nuclear
<BR>
material (say, find out the weight of a nuclear warhead, estimate and
<BR>
subtract out the weight of the components that do not rely on the mass
<BR>
of the nuclear warhead, figure out the formula for those that do - for
<BR>
instance, more implosive needed for more nuclear material - and solve).
<BR>
Most components of the warhead could be bought easily and anonymously
<BR>
enough.
<BR>
<P>The problem is, where to get the nuclear material?  It is rare, and
<BR>
would probably require connections and money on the order of getting a
<BR>
pre-assembled warhead.  (Besides, you couldn't ever get credit for
<BR>
doing this - not if you wanted to live - and one built by someone else
<BR>
after extensive testing would be more reliable for a one-shot than one
<BR>
you built yourself.)
