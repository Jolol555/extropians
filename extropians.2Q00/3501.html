<EM>&gt;My idea is to use insurance companies.  Parents would be required to buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;insurance on their future kids.  And these policies would pay off if the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;child
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has a horrible birth defect, ends up in jail, or on welfare.  This would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;leave
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the decision in the hands of a free market.  And this should encourage 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;loser
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;types to either reduce the number of children they have, or use high 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sperm donors.  It might also help people make better mate selection 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decisions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;BTW, I think we could also require insurance as a condition for parole.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way harmless people would be let out, while dangerous people would be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;facing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;impossibly high insurance rates.

Good Job Cynthia!!  As I've been posting - if you've noticed - insurance 
<BR>
provides a general solution to a lot of problems having to do with risk.  It 
<BR>
should be possible to completely replace the monopoly state in a few decades 
<BR>
with competing insurance companies, in fact, plus private arbitration 
<BR>
systems, private police, and hopefully, a general social contract.
<BR>
<P>In such a society, if it's profitable to rehabilitate a criminal, then 
<BR>
someone will probably make a business out of it.  If a particular person 
<BR>
refuses to change his predatory behavior, however, then, when he or she runs 
<BR>
out of resources to finance it, they will find their freedom so curtailed 
<BR>
that merely to survive will require making deals at very unpleasant terms - 
<BR>
reflecting the risk they pose to anyone who chooses to deal with them at 
<BR>
all, a good lesson if they will learn it, and an example and deterent to 
<BR>
others.
<BR>
<P>A lot of the problem in dealing with criminals is this notion of &quot;public 
<BR>
property.&quot;  If the roads and sidewalks were all privately owned - as they 
<BR>
already are in many proprietary communities - then where would the criminal 
<BR>
go?  How would they get there?  There would doubtless be communities of 
<BR>
higher and lower risk, employing varieties of strategies to deal with market 
<BR>
demand and preference.  The criminals, as they were apprehended or 
<BR>
identified would find themselves increasingly segregated into communities 
<BR>
oriented toward high-risk citizens.
<BR>
<P>Jails as such would likely be few and far between, while occasional &quot;pirate 
<BR>
societies&quot; or &quot;Casbahs&quot; might give a degree of freedom - at the price of the 
<BR>
associated risks - to the incorrigibles, while keeping them away from their 
<BR>
more rational intended victims.
<BR>
<P>(From an engineering standpoint, you probably don't want to eliminate crime 
<BR>
altogether.  If you do, you tend to lose your immune system.  Criminals keep 
<BR>
us aware to some degree of risk factors, much like hackers.)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, what you suggest are not some sort of special cases, but rather, 
<BR>
pieces of a more general solution.  In the case of the children, however, I 
<BR>
suspect that part of the eventual evolution of the social contract might 
<BR>
involve paying some percentage of one's income back to one's parents or 
<BR>
guardians, thus creating a more positive incentive to raise good kids than 
<BR>
just lowering ones insurance premiums.
