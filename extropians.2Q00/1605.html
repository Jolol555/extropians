<P><EM>    &gt;When its not foreseen (as Moore's Law helps us to do), then excessive
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;productivity growth causes overcapacity, overstocked inventories
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;So, what do you do if you're making more stuff than you need? You gave the answer
<BR>
yourself &quot;and then a slowdown in production&quot;. That's exactly what should happen,
<BR>
things worked differently in the old USSR, somebody would just set manufacturing
<BR>
quotas that seemed nice, the result was they'd have 10 times as much of one
<BR>
product as they needed an a tenth as much as another they needed.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;and a layoff of employees
</EM><BR>
<P>Why layoff people? If I find an improved method of making fiberglass underwear
<BR>
so that only a few manufacturing people can satisfy the entire world demand then
<BR>
the thousands of people that had been making this wonderful product can now
<BR>
make something else that we need more. Any large change in the economy or
<BR>
large change in anything else for that matter, will be bad for some people, but in
<BR>
general people should always make things that other people want the most,
<BR>
it's good for most workers and good for most consumers.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;which reduces purchasing,
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would purchasing decline when prices fall?
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;if cheap and easy nuclear fusion magically became possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;today, and within a few months most everybody had a fusion plant in
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;their back yard, what do you think would happen to the economy?
</EM><BR>
<P>Then the current economic expansion would accelerate. Of course.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;How  about if nanotech became magically possible today? I'll tell you:
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;the economy would go into a major depression for a good 3-10 years.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that's a rather silly thing to say now isn't it.
<BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;You are talking about making obsolete a whole economy almost overnight.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but you almost make that sound like a bad thing.
