<P>
Please do not use HTML formatting. Your message is not visible here for
<BR>
me to work with properly. Standard ettiquette for mail lists is standard
<BR>
ascii messages, and rarely use attachments, only for very special
<BR>
reasons.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From your loaded and rather vile words for the IRA and Catholics in
</EM><BR>
general, I took you be be pro-british. If that is not the case, then my
<BR>
apologies, however I'd warn you about using semantically loaded words if
<BR>
you don't meant to convey the content of those words (I'm sure Nadia
<BR>
will have a retort to me about this, to which I pre-reply that I always
<BR>
mean what I say).
<BR>
<P>By the association with our revolution, it was not an attempt to take a
<BR>
'moral high ground'. It was to point out to you that people who greatly
<BR>
respect the people who conducted the revolution are not very likely to
<BR>
sympathize with people descended from the oppressors of those
<BR>
revolutionaries, especially when they are seen as oppressing the group
<BR>
in question at the moment. Unless of course you admit that your
<BR>
opposition to our Declaration of Independence and the oppressive acts
<BR>
surrounding those events (including the attempted confiscation of
<BR>
private firearms by Governor Gage) was in fact an immoral act or acts.
<BR>
To which I would reply that you folks don't seem to be learning any
<BR>
lessons from history.
