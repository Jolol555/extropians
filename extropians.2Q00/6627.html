...In respect of the chronic disruption of sleep wake cycles...as opposed to
<BR>
chronic undersleeping...
<BR>
<P>I have had occasion to train soldiers; flight personnel; and medical people
<BR>
who work disruptive schedules...
<BR>
<P>In addition to a presentation that is similar to chronic undersleeping,
<BR>
these people SEEM to display a marked inability to learn complex tasks
<BR>
requiring the manipulation of mental images.
<BR>
<P>...they &quot;bounce back&quot; after a week or two of adjustment to a circadian
<BR>
cycle - thank god!
<BR>
<P>Does anyone know what research has been done in this area?  Such persons'
<BR>
ability to manipulate complex cognitive models is often critical to their
<BR>
job. It has always struck me as strange that they seem to be the ones so
<BR>
seriously at risk of defects in this sort of thinking. Is this a recognized
<BR>
fact?

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;         As I understand it, melatonin is responsible for the reset of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the biological clock and is released during the night.  I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; frequently been told that when you are forced to operate on night
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; hours, the best way to ward off sleepiness is to work in a low or no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; light environment, as this triggers the release of melatonin.  Is this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; generally true and are there safer and more useful ways to sustain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; well-being during these conditions?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I would rather say you should do the opposite. Light inhibits the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;release of melatonin, which is (among other things) why we feel more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alert and happy in bright sunlight and why people often have trouble
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;falling alseep in lit rooms. Conversely, if you work in the dark you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have a higher chance of becoming sleepy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;         As far as I can tell, the general symptoms of this behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; are depression, fatigue, and anxiety.  I'm interested as to if anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; has any knowledge of the long term effect of this behavior on one's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; general health and longevity, as well as ways to counter any possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; effects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sounds likely. You essentially get a form of jet-lag as your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;biological rhythms do not fit with your activity patterns. Try working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in brightly lit areas during the night, and sleep in carefully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;darkened rooms during the day. Possibly melatonin supplements could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;used to really fix the schedule.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Further, are there any technologies in development that are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; feasible tools to reduce the general amount of sleep required by an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; individual?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not as far as I know, although there are likely some gains to be made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from learning to sleep more efficiently (however that is done :-). The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;memory consolidation that appears to go on during sleep is likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tricky to speed up, but if I find a way I'm sure you will notice. :-)
