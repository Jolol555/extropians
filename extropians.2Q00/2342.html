<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eugene, let me paraphrase your viewpoint into a different viewpoint.
<BR>
What
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are saying sounds similar to the belief that the copy is an
<BR>
inactive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backup.  As long as it hasn't been activated or allowed to process a
<BR>
single
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought on its own, it can be deleted.  Since it has never run it's
<BR>
neural
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processor or processed a single thought, it is more like a standby
<BR>
computer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a backup disk that has not ever been turned on.  Until we turn
<BR>
it on,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it has never been alive.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this consistent with your viewpoint?  Stated in the above words,
<BR>
I must
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agree.  An inert backup copy that has never become functional is
<BR>
just a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backup copy and can be deleted.  Its software program is not
<BR>
running, has
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never run, and cannot be terminated.  At this point, you are merely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroying one of my backup copies, but not a running consciousness.
<BR>
Your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analogy with abortion is very close here, with this copy ready to be
<BR>
born
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and become alive in an instant.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I agree with both points of view, and we are getting caught
<BR>
up with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;semantics of &quot;what is death&quot; and the details of &quot;why&quot; the copy is
<BR>
not yet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alive.  I was so distracted by your argument that the copies must be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identical, that it had not previously occurred to me that the copy
<BR>
had not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet been allowed to have independent thought on its own yet.  To put
<BR>
my own
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;semantic spin on things, you are interrupting the process of
<BR>
creating a copy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not finishing the final step of giving it consciousness.  Until
<BR>
that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;final step, it is not yet alive.  It is an inert clone of spare
<BR>
parts that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not been animated.
<BR>
<P><P>In reference to;
<BR>
&quot;you are interrupting the process of creating a copy and not finishing the
<BR>
final step of giving it consciousness&quot;, 
<BR>
<P>Observation: What you are hypothetically creating is not then, in fact, a
<BR>
'copy,' since not all characteristics (such as consciousness [whatever you
<BR>
mean by that]) are duplicated.  IMO, it would be more accurate to assert
<BR>
instead that you are creating a static _record_ of the present state of a
<BR>
dynamic process.  Yes, I agree, that the act of destroying a record would be
<BR>
considered fundamentally different from the act of destroying a 'conscious'
<BR>
dynamic process.
<BR>
<P>Question: I don't recall who originated this thread, but you know who you
<BR>
are (or, as the case may be, 'were').  Of this person, I ask: 
<BR>
<P>was activation implied by 'copy', or no?
