<EM>&gt; &gt;take the word of Prof. Cramer over most anyone on this list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but since you're not telling us enough to judge what's being said by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cramer, this is perilously close to argument from authority.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The rough sense I get of the process can be modeled like this (forgive me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if I'm way wrong):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You have a one-tonne ingot of steel down the back of the starship in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freefall, aimed up an electromagnetic launcher. You turn on your power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source and the coils click into brief action one after another, dragging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ingot ever faster toward the prow.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When it gets to the nose of the ship, the lump is moving at 0.9999 c, say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and masses 2.2 million megatonnes. It hits the plate at the end of the ship
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and recoils, shoving the ship the hell forward (but the ship has meanwhile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been flying backward, hasn't it, impelled by this internal mass driver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect?), and as it recoils down the launcher its energy and momentum are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sucked back into the ship, pushing it the other way, balancing the books.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Except that by the time it's slowed completely and reached the aft storage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; container, it's back to massing a single tonne. So the books are *not*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; balanced, there's been a net impulse forward when the ingot was *really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really heavy*, its m having been pumped up by all that injected e from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; batteries.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This doesn't make a *hell* of a lot of sense to me, but is that something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like your story?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Bearing in mind that there's no striker plate, because your asymmetrical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mass is actually rotating, all working parts being made from some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supernatural material, and that it isn't zillions of klicks long, and all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that pesky detail stuff...)
</EM><BR>
<P>Essentially correct. Frankly I was ready to give up on the whole thing
<BR>
until I heard this from Cramer, and I'm still not sure I understand
<BR>
totally why he thinks it would work in those conditions. And you are
<BR>
right, under normal conditions you'd need some hellaciously cool
<BR>
materials to keep the centrifuge together under those relativistic
<BR>
velocities. The two possibilities that intrigue me though are a) using
<BR>
photons or other subatomic particles as the working 'mass' within the
<BR>
centrifuge, and b) usinge fluids that have a very very low internal
<BR>
speed of light.
<BR>
<P>With possibility (a), as opposed to using the laser/maser/particle beam
<BR>
as a linear reaction device (i.e. throwing away that energy/mass), you'd
<BR>
be recycling some of it, and with possibility (b) if the effect only
<BR>
depends upon the speed of light for particles within the working media,
<BR>
then you can use much lower velocities to attain this relativistic
<BR>
effect. As I recall we now have materials that have an internal speed of
<BR>
light of 30 meters per second or so. If these can be used in fluid form,
<BR>
in the centrifuge, can you move these through the device at or near 30
<BR>
meters per second to get this effect? I don't know, but I'm interested
<BR>
enough to want to test it. People that sit on their armchairs making up
<BR>
excuses why something is impossible don't interest me. If I prove it
<BR>
doesn't work by experiment, then oh well, it was a nice idea.
<BR>
<P>As for those that compare my designs to a Dean drive, I can say that
<BR>
there are significant design flaws in the Dean drive.
