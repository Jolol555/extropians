<P>
We tend to talk about transparent society as tho it is some kind of
<BR>
future threat, but let us look at where we are now.
<BR>
<P>I bought a wireless camera and receiver, in order to attach it to
<BR>
a kite and fly over Mike Lorrey’s house.
<BR>
<P>{8^D  Kidding Mike bygones.  I bought one to size up the current
<BR>
threat to privacy posed by these cheap wireless cameras, and determine
<BR>
their suitability for a wearable.  Here is my short report.
<BR>
<P>The camera I bought is an 80 dollar model.  It has a wireless
<BR>
transmitter that has a range of about 30 to 40 meters.  It doesnt
<BR>
matter what stands between the transmitter and receiver.  It needs
<BR>
a 12 volt power supply on both the transmit and receive ends.
<BR>
The current draw is low enough that it would be useful as
<BR>
a wearable cam, keeping in mind of course the limited range.
<BR>
The transmitter unit will fit into a sphere the size of a baseball
<BR>
and has a mass of about 170 grams.  The receiver is slightly larger
<BR>
and slightly heavier.
<BR>
<P>The device has very good resolution and good color, better than
<BR>
the security cameras one sees in use today.  The outstanding
<BR>
weakness of this system is it has no means of adjusting for
<BR>
lighting conditions, and so the picture appears fairly dark in normal
<BR>
room light.  In low room light, it becomes functionally useless.
<BR>
<P>So far so good, but heres the part that has me a bit worried: the
<BR>
viewer on the transmitter has a plastic light shield that can be
<BR>
filed off.  If this is done, the light receiver lens is 2.5 mm
<BR>
diameter (a tenth of an inch).  If someone were to try to hide
<BR>
one of these devices, they would need a space the size of a
<BR>
baseball, a hole 2.5 mm diameter, and a power source.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, imagine yourself in a hotel room.  Search all around
<BR>
for baseball sized places behind something.  Where would
<BR>
someone try to hide one of these devices?  My first guess
<BR>
would be in the TV.  [Shades of Orwell’s 1984, eh?]  One
<BR>
could probably pull off a front panel, mount the thing in
<BR>
there, drill a 2.5 mm hole, tap into the power cord, put it
<BR>
back together and have a little spy system that the maids
<BR>
would neeeeever notice, in fact you and I would have a
<BR>
hard time finding it, knowing exactly what we are looking for.
<BR>
<P>If someone had a spycam mounted in the hotel TV, they
<BR>
could set up the receiver in any room on that hall, or they
<BR>
could save the cost of a room and set up the receiver and
<BR>
VCR in a car out in the parking lot.  There would be no
<BR>
risk to the person receiving, because there would be no
<BR>
way for you to figure out where the receiver is located,
<BR>
it being a passive device.
<BR>
<P>So.  80 bucks for the camera, 90 bucks gets you a VCR
<BR>
these days, and I think a tape is another couple, so 172
<BR>
clams plus the cost of at least one night’s room rent
<BR>
puts one in the spy business.  Little kids can come up
<BR>
with that kind of money, and when it comes down to
<BR>
it, that is exactly the kind of person who might be
<BR>
tempted to try such a scheme: the 12-15 crowd.  There
<BR>
is also the pervert crowd and perhaps an odd blackmailer
<BR>
or two thrown in.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, I see four ways to defeat such goings on:
<BR>
1) Search the hotel TV for 2.5 mm diameter holes.
<BR>
2)   Keep the lights in your room low.
<BR>
3) Turn the TV to face away from whatever you dont
<BR>
want the whole world to see,
<BR>
4) throw a towel or blanket over the TV.
<BR>
<P>Gives ya the creeps, does it not?  Extropian friends, we must
<BR>
face the fact that all technology is not necessarily good, even
<BR>
if it is cool.  We need not speak  of transparent society as something
<BR>
that is coming.  We are already there.   spike
