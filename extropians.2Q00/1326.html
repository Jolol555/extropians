<EM>&gt;From: James Rogers &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jamesr@best.com?Subject=RE:%20Identity%20Crises%20(was)%20Re:%20Where%20do%20cool%20people%20go&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000421191828.12263.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">jamesr@best.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is a very interesting pattern, because I know other people who also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fit in the same kind of pigeon holes.  I think each of these pigeon holes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are strong manifestations of specific characteristics:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1) There seems to be a surprising number of ex-military people on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;list (I am ex-Army -- light infantry), and a fair number of rugged,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gun-toting, outdoorsy types.  I would attribute this to strong principles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of self-reliance.  Still, at first glance I wouldn't expect as many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ex-military people to be here as there are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;2) Computer/techno nerd describes most everyone on the list and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably the single most common factor.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;3) Extropians seem to tend to be health nuts.  There aren't as many &quot;body
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nazis&quot; as I would expect (too many engineers? :^), but health issues are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;obviously very important to most people here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;4) From my own experience, I would hazard a guess that people tend to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;excellence seekers at a level that exceeds that of the general population.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maybe extropians just have good taste, but I would guess that it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;derived from a desire to push life to the next level (whatever that means).
</EM><BR>
<P>Well I think it goes without saying that extropians love life.  Personally I 
<BR>
would like to make it to the singularity and then go on living for thousands 
<BR>
(millions?) of years.  I don't think I'd ever get tired of the fantastic 
<BR>
voyage that is life.  My guess is that this is probably the one sentiment 
<BR>
that *everyone* on this list shares.  Which, when you think about it, 
<BR>
naturally leads to the various inter-genre &quot;pigeon holes&quot; that have been 
<BR>
talked about in this thread.  Someone (Ben Franklin?) once said: &quot;Do you 
<BR>
love life?  Then do not waste time, for that is the stuff life is made of.&quot;
<BR>
<P>For me, always hoping for the best but preparing for the worst I guess, I 
<BR>
hope that I'll make it to the singularity, but I live my life now as if I 
<BR>
won't.  Meaning that I try to fit in as much living into my life as 
<BR>
possible.  Every free moment is spent seeking out new ideas, new 
<BR>
experiences, new relationships, new outlooks and worldviews.  The interests, 
<BR>
activities, hobbies, lifestyles, musical genres etc. I have enjoyed over the 
<BR>
years could fill several multi-page posts.  So I won't even bother going 
<BR>
into it, except to say, for example, if you named a genre or style of music 
<BR>
chances are I'd be able to tell you about my favorite song, artist or album 
<BR>
in that genre (unless of course you get too obscure, like traditional 
<BR>
Siamese or something).
<BR>
<P>For another example, from my posts to date, I think its fairly clear that I 
<BR>
lean toward the &quot;liberal&quot; pole.  I favor things like gun control and efforts 
<BR>
to improve the lives of the most disadvantaged in society.  But I do own a 
<BR>
couple of guns and I am proficient in their use.  I also own a fairly 
<BR>
successful business and have never yet obtained any sort of welfare or 
<BR>
public assistance.  Perhaps that seems contradictory, but I've spent my life 
<BR>
always trying to see both sides of any given issue.
<BR>
<P>Bottom line is I think it comes down to the fact that the reason we want to 
<BR>
live forever is that we realize there is a *lot* left to life that we have 
<BR>
not experienced and cannot possibly experience in a mere hundred years or 
<BR>
so.  So I can't claim any particular pigeon holes.  My pigeon hole would 
<BR>
have to be the set of all pigeon holes (although admittedly I haven't gotten 
<BR>
around to even a small fraction of them yet, but I'm working on it).
<BR>
