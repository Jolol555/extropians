-----Original Message-----

John Clark apparently said (in part);
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If defense cost far more than offence, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it does and always will, then a ABM system can't save it and it doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matter if the city's value is zero or infinity. Don't misunderstand me, I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not happy with this situation but that's the way things are.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not being too much of a student of history nonetheless I've been lead to
<BR>
beleive that it has ALWAYS been an &quot;arms race&quot; between precisely defense vs
<BR>
offense. In some eras of history defense (the age of castles) is
<BR>
paramount...in others offense reigns.....the pendelum swings.....
<BR>
<P>At this time it would seem to the uniformed but curious layman (me) that
<BR>
groundbased  or airborne kinetic energy weapons (railguns),  and/or laser
<BR>
weapons would be more than a match for incoming ballistic weapons......
<BR>
<P><P>For example....a hypothetical laser weapon.
<BR>
<P>Imagine a generator about the size of a heifer (several hundred pounds)
<BR>
turning at high speeds designed in such a way that when the &quot;juice&quot; is put
<BR>
to the primary windings (secondary?....I forget the terms...) it stops in
<BR>
nanoseconds (ok....milliseconds....or even great big fractions of
<BR>
seconds....).....thereby converting all that rotational inertia into heat
<BR>
and electricity....which is then used to fire off a laser &quot;round&quot;....
<BR>
<P>I have it on (kinda) good authority that G.E. was (is) working on such a
<BR>
thingie....they &quot;gave&quot; it to the kids at Texas A&amp;M and told em to &quot;break&quot;
<BR>
it.....(test it to destruction....Texas boys is GOOD at &quot;testing things to
<BR>
destruction)
<BR>
<P>Now imagine a whole array of such generators....mounted on a 747 say.....and
<BR>
&quot;spun-up&quot; by the slip stream of the aircraft or some jet engine exhaust
<BR>
arrangement.....
<BR>
<P>What you then have is a multiple shot hi-energy, transportable missle
<BR>
killer.....if coupled with the appropriate targeting data I would
<BR>
assume......
<BR>
<P>How far can a (many) kilo(mega?) watt &quot;lazer-burst&quot; reach when fired from an
<BR>
aircraft at hi altitude?
<BR>
<P>The above being only one scenario......no matter how fast a reentry vehickle
<BR>
is it ain't lightspeed.....and given multiple laser shots don't worry about
<BR>
the decoys....
<BR>
<P>Kill em alllllllllllll (re-entry vehickles that is....)
<BR>

<BR>
San Antonio Tx....(remember the Alamo!!!!)
