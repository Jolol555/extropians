<P><EM>&gt; Any thoughts on human genetic manipulation?  Say, with the purpose of =
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creating a workable interface between an electronic microprocessor and a =
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human mind?  Throw in some nanotechnology for physical interaction...  =
</EM><BR>
<P>How would genetic modifications of the genome create a good
<BR>
brain-computer interface? 
<BR>
<P>I think we transhumanists have to be careful about our enthusiasm and
<BR>
think carefully about the relative timeframes and levels of comelexity
<BR>
needed to achieve certain things. Setting upp chemical gradients in
<BR>
the brain so that engineered neurons growing on animplant can reach
<BR>
the right areas seems doable in the relatively near future; creating a
<BR>
nice socket on the skull through genetic engineering is much, much
<BR>
harder (requires us to master localized morphogenesis). And of course,
<BR>
nanotechnology is something completely different.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Education equates to software development...  Implications?
</EM><BR>
<P>As The Great Cathulhu pointed out, the similarities are small. I would
<BR>
actually say practically zero. Software development has a definite
<BR>
goal, which is sought using various methodologies building a
<BR>
system. Education has a very loose goal of creating a great adult
<BR>
human being, but is an interaction between a learning agent and an
<BR>
environment where other agents try to achieve this goal.
<BR>
<P>This goes both for todays humans and for augmented humans tomorrow -
<BR>
if I had a chip in my head providing instant access to information
<BR>
when I was a small kid, it would still just have been a high-potence
<BR>
information source I had to integrate into my growing cognitive
<BR>
network. If an augmented human can be designed like a software
<BR>
project, then either the entities doing the project are of such a high
<BR>
order of capability that they are definitely posthuman, or the
<BR>
&quot;augmented&quot; human will be extremely simple and predictable. True
<BR>
learning and education is a synthesis of various forms of information
<BR>
into new and useful cognitive patterns. This is unpredictable and
<BR>
highly individual - even simple neural networks develop different
<BR>
internal representations when you train them in different runs.
<BR>
<P>I think gardening is the best metaphor I can come up with for
<BR>
education right now.
