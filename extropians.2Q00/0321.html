<EM>&gt; Wow, I was very impressed by your ideas.  It must be incredibly frustrating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have such great concepts but not the capital or the connections to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them made real.  And when they do eventually come about you will not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting a slice of the profit pie.  But at least the world would be a better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, give me a break.  &quot;Incredibly frustrating?&quot;  Would any sane person
<BR>
expect to be showered with capital or connections simply because of a
<BR>
great idea?  A great idea is worth nothing.  It's just that genuinely
<BR>
valuable things like teams, credentials, and capital are worth
<BR>
substantially more when combined with a great idea.
<BR>
<P>As for getting a slice of the profit pie, I can afford to give ideas
<BR>
away.  It's not like I'm going to run out.  If I need an idea for a
<BR>
startup - for that matter, if any Singularitarian asks me for an idea
<BR>
for a startup - I have quite a few socially important business concepts
<BR>
that weren't on the list.  I even have business concepts that would
<BR>
simply make money, and which I therefore have no reason to give away. 
<BR>
And I can always get more.
<BR>
<P>A great idea is worth nothing if kept secret, but if you give it away,
<BR>
people become interested.  They know you're worth talking to.  That's
<BR>
where &quot;connections&quot; come from.  (Of course, this strategy requires that
<BR>
you have enough ideas to be able to afford to give them away.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To try to get through the 'screens' that surround the very wealthy can be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extremely difficult task.  But have you even tried, Eliezer?  Perhaps you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should write grant proposals to charity foundations like the one created by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bill Gates and his wife.  But I realize they are into looking at 'resumes'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to see if one is deserving as you pointed out.  But nothing ventured,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing gained.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wrong strategy.  You don't call them.  They call you.  And you get there
<BR>
by writing things that &quot;they&quot; are interested in.
<BR>
<P>Foundations don't give grants to nonprofits without a track record, and
<BR>
you can't get a track record without funding for accomplishments.  And
<BR>
that doesn't happen until they call you.
<BR>
<P>I conclude with two quotes, neither of whose attributions I remember:
<BR>
<P>&quot;There is no limit to what you can accomplish if you do not demand
<BR>
credit for it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Don't worry about people stealing your ideas.  If your ideas are any
<BR>
good, you'll have to shove them down people's throats.&quot;
