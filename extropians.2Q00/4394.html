<P><EM>&gt; I've been watching this thread for some time and my ignorance of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matters is driving me crazy - what is meant by 'flat' in this context?  My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immediate reaction to the adjective 'flat' is 'nearly two dimensional'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certainly I have the wrong idea - given a &gt;2 dimensional universe.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the terms &quot;open,&quot; &quot;closed,&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; refer to curvature. thus
<BR>
two parallel lines diverge in an universe with &quot;open&quot; or negative
<BR>
curvature; the same two lines always meet in an universe with &quot;closed&quot; or
<BR>
positive curvature; and they stay the same distance apart in an universe
<BR>
with &quot;flat&quot; or zero curvature. since all three spatial dimensions curve,
<BR>
it is useful to think of it as curvature on a fourth spatial dimension.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other differences include -- the universe's expansion accelerates
<BR>
if it's open, decelerates and reverses if it's closed, and decelerates
<BR>
forever if it's flat. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; And, I would love to hear more about, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'what eerie odds would be overcome if such were really the case.'

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hmm, reading the quote a second time, i'm afraid i didn't make
<BR>
myself clear. what i meant to say was, what eerie odds would be overcome
<BR>
if such were really the case _without_inflation_. which, i might add, is
<BR>
just silly.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this refers to the flatness problem back in the 70's. that is, for
<BR>
the universe to be anywhere near flat today, it would have to have been so
<BR>
close to perfectly flat when it started (99. 9 to some ungodly decimal
<BR>
place %), that it would be almost too much to ask of chance.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of course, then alan guth et. al. came up with inflation ... which
<BR>
resolved a whole slew of cosmological problems and _predicted_ a flat (or
<BR>
very nearly flat) universe. which (to come full circle) is why the latest
<BR>
findings are such a forceful boost to inflationary theory (as if it needed
<BR>
much). 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Please enlighten me.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again, i'm nooo expert.
