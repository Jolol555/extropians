<P>This is the scariest aspect of where we are headed in the fairly near
<BR>
future, to me. Leaving aside the jovial reply of a Robert Bradbury, who
<BR>
would happily eat and upgrade the cosmos, there's a lot of thwarted or
<BR>
fucked-up monkey programming ready to hit the fan once most people have
<BR>
their bellies full and nothing much to do all day except play arbitrary
<BR>
games. 
<BR>
<P>Last night I watched a chilling BBC program by a journo who infiltrated a
<BR>
bunch of soccer thugs in Britain and furtively filmed their antics and
<BR>
boasts. These were not stupid men, by and large. Some of them had (or once
<BR>
had) reasonably demanding jobs. They just lerrrrved smacking and bashing
<BR>
the shit out of other people. Their blood was up, it boiled with rage and
<BR>
delight, they had flow and peak experience. There's going to be a lot of it
<BR>
going around, even if Banks's Culture emerges.
<BR>
<P>And please don't tell me this won't happen if everyone's packing heat (as
<BR>
they used to say on the mean streets)
