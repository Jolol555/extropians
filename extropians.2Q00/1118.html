Hi List
<BR>
<P><P>Here is a forward from Fraser Clark which also is sent to posthuman@egroup:

############################################################
<BR>
<P>The Prophet Unrecognised is gradually beginning to be recognised after his
<BR>
death.  One by one the various national media are making references to
<BR>
Terence Mckenna's recent 'death'.
<BR>
<P>Too bad he had to die to get people's attention but, then, i suppose that's
<BR>
life and i guess he's not the first prophet to have had to go through such a
<BR>
process.  i see him ending up as a 'Saint' to the New Culture over the next
<BR>
decade or so, as more and more of the more and more new people start to
<BR>
check him out as the Singularity rushes upon us.
<BR>
<P>below are the new york times' and los angeles times' obituaries.  check the
<BR>
tone of each.  wouldn't you say the writer's tongues were scarcely in their
<BR>
cheeks at all?!   :-)
<BR>
<P>PS:  don't quote me, but it seems PROBABLE that Megatripolis The Second
<BR>
Coming will be launching at Heaven on thursday may 25th and we'll be
<BR>
devoting the whole evening in the debatathon room to something like &quot;Is
<BR>
Terence, Arms Outstretched and Smirk In Place, Waiting for Us At The
<BR>
Singularity At The End Of Time?&quot;  would anyone who knew his work well
<BR>
contact the parallel-youniversity about speaking?  i also have all his
<BR>
favourit classic raps on DAT and we'll be unleashing a very rare and
<BR>
now-unrepeatable treat.

<P><P>NEW YORK TIMES OBITUARY
<BR>
<P>TERENCE MCKENNA, PATRON OF PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS
<BR>
Terence McKenna, who so playfully and persistently pressed his message that
<BR>
psychedelic drugs are mankind's salvation that Timothy Leary himself
<BR>
christened him &quot;the Timothy Leary of the 90's,&quot; died on Monday at a friend's
<BR>
home in San Rafael, Calif. He was 53 and lived on the South Kona Coast of
<BR>
Hawaii.
<BR>
The cause of death was brain cancer, said a publicist for his books.
<BR>
<P>&quot;If psychedelics don't ready you for the great beyond, then I don't know
<BR>
what really does,&quot; Mr. McKenna said in December in one of his last public
<BR>
speeches, at the Esalen Institute. Death, he said then, felt close.
<BR>
<P>Mr. McKenna combined a leprechaun's wit with a poet's sensibility to brew a
<BR>
New Age stew with ingredients including flying saucers, elves and the I
<BR>
Ching. The essential seasoning was the psychedelic mushrooms that
<BR>
transformed his life and that he recommended-in &quot;heroic doses&quot;-for virtually
<BR>
everyone.
<BR>
He lived on the wild side of a wild generation. He dropped acid in San
<BR>
Francisco in the 1960's, smuggled hashish in India and searched the jungles
<BR>
of the Amazon for the magic mushrooms.
<BR>
<P>He told interviewers that he had smoked marijuana every day from the time he
<BR>
was a teenager. In the 1990's, Mr. McKenna gained fame by delivering his
<BR>
drug pitch to a new generation at nightclub &quot;raves.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&quot;My real function was to give people permission,&quot; he said in an article to
<BR>
appear in the May issue of Wired magazine.  &quot;Essentially, what I existed for
<BR>
was to say, 'Go ahead, you'll live through it, get loaded, you don't have to
<BR>
be afraid.'&quot;
<BR>
<P>In lectures, in recordings and in five books, Mr. McKenna made his case for
<BR>
illegal substances that many experts consider highly dangerous. He had a
<BR>
grand theory: that psychedelic mushrooms are the missing link in the story
<BR>
of human evolution. Not until our primate ancestors began eating
<BR>
hallucinatory psilocybin mushrooms, he contended, did they begin to acquire
<BR>
human qualities.
<BR>
<P>Mr. McKenna, a lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard and deep-set eyes,
<BR>
also professed to know exactly when the world would end: Dec. 22, 2012. He
<BR>
came to this conclusion through a mathematical construct he based on the I
<BR>
Ching, the ancient Chinese book of divination.
<BR>
<P>The package he pushed struck a chord, at least among the usual suspects.
<BR>
Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead called him &quot;the only person who has made a
<BR>
serious effort to objectify the psychedelic experience.&quot;
<BR>
<P>But experts on drug treatment attacked Mr. McKenna for popularizing
<BR>
dangerous substances. &quot;Surely the fact that Terence McKenna says that the
<BR>
psilocybin mushroom 'is the megaphone used by an alien, intergalactic Other
<BR>
to communicate with mankind' is enough for us to wonder if taking LSD has
<BR>
done something to his mental faculties,&quot; Judy Corman, vice president of
<BR>
Phoenix House of New York, a drug treatment center, said in a letter to The
<BR>
New York Times in 1993.
<BR>
Still others had big trouble with his self-consciously cosmic literary
<BR>
style. &quot;I suffered hallucinatory agonies of my own while reading his shrilly
<BR>
ecstatic prose,&quot; Peter Conrad wrote in The New York Times in a 1993 review
<BR>
of Mr. McKenna's book &quot;True Hallucinations,&quot; published by Harper San
<BR>
Francisco.
<BR>
<P>But many marveled at his stream of novel thoughts. &quot;To write him off as a
<BR>
crazy hippie is a rather lazy approach to a man not only full of fascinating
<BR>
ideas but also blessed with a sense of humor and self-parody,&quot; Tom
<BR>
Hodgkinson wrote in The New Statesman and Society in 1994.
<BR>
<P>Terence Kemp McKenna was born on Nov. 16, 1946, in a Colorado cattle and
<BR>
coal town, Paonia. He was a youth given to  memorizing passages of James
<BR>
Joyce and reading Carl Jung's  &quot;Psychology and Alchemy,&quot; and his main
<BR>
satisfactions percolated from his fertile imagination.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I think my first encounter with psychedelics was looking at Colorado and
<BR>
trying to understand that it was once the shores of an ocean with
<BR>
hundred-foot-long sauropods tromping through the mangrove swamps,&quot; he told
<BR>
Details magazine in 1993.
<BR>
<P>He found his way to San Francisco in 1965.  According to the April 1993
<BR>
issue of Details magazine, Barry Melton, the guitarist for Country Joe &amp; the
<BR>
Fish, introduced him to marijuana in 1965. Soon he tried LSD.
<BR>
<P>He enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley that year and was
<BR>
accepted into the Tussman Experimental College, which emphasized
<BR>
self-direction. After the two-year program, he embarked on travels around
<BR>
the world.
<BR>
<P>In 1971 he and his brother, Dennis, journeyed to the Amazon jungle in search
<BR>
of psychedelic plants. In a tiny mission settlement in southern Colombia,
<BR>
they encountered, for the first time, what drug enthusiasts call &quot;magic
<BR>
mushrooms.&quot;
<BR>
In 1972, Mr. McKenna returned to Berkeley to finish college. He completed a
<BR>
self-tailored degree in ecology, resource recovery and shamanism. His mind
<BR>
was focused on, and certainly by, mushrooms. No one had yet figured out how
<BR>
to cultivate the mushrooms in the United States, but the McKennas brought
<BR>
the South American secrets home. They published them, and in the 1980's were
<BR>
growing 70 pounds every six weeks. The operation ended when a friend was
<BR>
arrested for his fungi farm.
<BR>
<P>In 1975, the two brothers published their first book, &quot;The Invisible
<BR>
Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens and the I Ching.&quot; Mr.McKenna began to lecture
<BR>
both to old hippies and converts to the emerging New Age. According to
<BR>
Wired, he drifted into the role of &quot;charismatic talking head.&quot; He wrote four
<BR>
books in the early 1990's. In addition to &quot;True Hallucinations,&quot; they were
<BR>
&quot;Food of the Gods&quot; (Bantam, 1992); &quot;The Archaic Revival&quot; (Harper San
<BR>
Francisco) and &quot;Trialogues at the Edge of the West,&quot; written with Ralph
<BR>
Abraham and Rupert Sheldrake (Bear &amp; Company, 1992).
<BR>
<P>Mr. McKenna met his wife, Kathleen Harrison, in Jerusalem in the mid-1970's.
<BR>
They settled in Occidental, a small town north of San Francisco. They had a
<BR>
son, Finn, who now lives in Jersey City, N.J., and a daughter, Klea, of
<BR>
Santa Cruz, Calif. He is also survived by his brother, Dennis, who lives in
<BR>
Minneapolis.
<BR>
After a divorce in 1992, Mr. McKenna moved to Hawaii, where he and his
<BR>
former wife owned property.  Mr. McKenna built a modernist house, which is
<BR>
topped with a huge antenna dish for the Internet communications with which
<BR>
he became enamored.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Without sounding too cliched, the Internet really is the birth of global
<BR>
mind,&quot; he told Wired. &quot;That's what a god is. Somebody who knows more than
<BR>
you do about whatever you're dealing with.&quot;
<BR>
<P>When he fell ill last May, Mr. McKenna was enjoying a new life with Christy
<BR>
Silness, a young woman he had met the year before at an ethnobotanical
<BR>
conference in the Yucatan. He had medical treatment for glioblastoma
<BR>
multiforma, a rare form of brain cancer, while friends and followers added
<BR>
more esoteric touches.
<BR>
<P>A self-styled &quot;grand kahuna of Polynesia&quot; biked up the mountain to meditate
<BR>
at his bedside. A Nevada disk jockey, Art Bell, asked his 13 million
<BR>
listeners to send good vibrations.  Wired said Mr. McKenna, like many
<BR>
others, wondered whether a lifetime of drug use might be to blame for his
<BR>
brain tumor.
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;So what about it?&quot; he asked his doctors. &quot;You want to hammer on me about
<BR>
that?&quot; They assured him there was no causal link. &quot;So what about 35 years of
<BR>
daily dope smoking?&quot; he asked.  They pointed to studies suggesting that
<BR>
cannabis may shrink tumors.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&quot;Listen,&quot; Mr. McKenna told them, &quot;if cannabis shrinks tumors, we wouldn't
<BR>
be having this discussion.&quot;

<P><P>LOS ANGELES TIMES OBITUARY   Friday April 7, 2000
<BR>
<P>TERENCE MCKENNA: PROMOTER OF PSYCHEDELIC DRUG USE
<BR>
Terence McKenna, a psychedelic pioneer, radical raconteur and passionate
<BR>
promoter of the mind-expanding powers of drugs, has died at 53.
<BR>
<P>McKenna succumbed to brain cancer at a friend's home in San Rafael on
<BR>
Monday. A student of shamanism, virtual reality and the botany of the
<BR>
Amazon, McKenna was a proponent of the use of psyilocybin, commonly called
<BR>
magic mushrooms, and believed human civilizations developed after early
<BR>
hunter-gatherers accidentally ingested psychedelic drugs.
<BR>
<P>He doggedly promoted that belief, as well as the idea that warfare developed
<BR>
only after the original hallucinogenic plants began to disappear because of
<BR>
climatic change.  &quot;Our dilemma is that, halfway on the way to becoming
<BR>
angels, we stopped taking our medicine,&quot; he once said.
<BR>
<P>His notions on the power of the drug experience drew a loyal following among
<BR>
members of the counterculture, including members of the Grateful Dead rock
<BR>
band.  &quot;Most of us who have been involved in the psychedelic experience wish
<BR>
we had the discipline and rigor of Terence McKenna,&quot; Jerry Garcia, the late
<BR>
lead singer and guitarist of the Grateful Dead, once said.  &quot;[He's] the one
<BR>
person who's made a serious effort to objectify the psychedelic
<BR>
experience-and done  a good job at it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>McKenna, who grew up in Paonia, Colo., moved to Los Altos, Calif., while in
<BR>
high school.  He attended UC Berkeley for two years and traveled extensively
<BR>
through Asia, Europe and South America before completing a self-tailored
<BR>
degree in shamanology at Berkeley in 1975.  After college he made his living
<BR>
dealing in Asian art in the East and as a professional butterfly collector.
<BR>
<P>He expounded his controversial theories claiming that psychedelic plants,
<BR>
most notably psilocybin mushrooms, were the key to the evolution of human
<BR>
consciousness in books including &quot;Food of the Gods,&quot; &quot;The Invisible
<BR>
Landscape&quot; and &quot;Psilocybin: The Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide,&quot; which he
<BR>
wrote with his brother Dennis.  Another title was &quot;True Hallunications,&quot; a
<BR>
narrative of spiritual adventure in the jungles of the Amazon.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From his home base in Hawaii McKenna also founded and operated Botanical
</EM><BR>
Dimensions, a non-profit organization dedicated to the investigation of
<BR>
&quot;ethnomedical&quot; and sacred plants.  He also established a gene bank of rare
<BR>
species near his home.
<BR>
<P>A celebrity on the Southern California rave scene of the early 1990's
<BR>
McKenna often appeared at all-night dance clubs where he delivered his
<BR>
pro-drug message.  He also gave lectures in more formal settings, such as
<BR>
UCLA's Wadsworth Theater.
<BR>
<P>McKenna explained to a Times reporter some years ago why he got stoned a
<BR>
lot.  &quot;My style of involvement [in drugs] is analytical and rational,&quot; he
<BR>
said.  &quot;Most people would think that that would melt the mystery away.
<BR>
That's not the case, actually.  If you keep a rational mind when you explore
<BR>
the more peculiar edges of things, you will find odd possibilities.&quot;
<BR>
<P>While calling for the legalization of controlled substances, he also noted
<BR>
that they were not for everyone, including the immature or mentally ill.
<BR>
&quot;Drugs are heavy equipment and you have to learn how to operate heavy
<BR>
equipment,&quot; he said.  &quot;We have driver's licences; we should teach people how
<BR>
to operate drugs.&quot;
<BR>
He is survived by his longtime partner, Christy Silness; his two children,
<BR>
Finn, 22 and Klea, 19; and his brother Dennis.
<BR>
<P>// ======== //
<BR>
<P><P>Terence McKenna, in Trialogues at the Edge of the Unthinkable (1998)
<BR>
<P>&quot;I have talked before about shamanism anticipating the future. If you pursue
<BR>
these psychedelic  shamanic plants, you inevitably arrive at an apocalyptic
<BR>
intuition. I think shamans have always seen the end, and that the human
<BR>
enterprise in three-dimensional space has always been finite. In the same
<BR>
way that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny as we look into the past, it seems
<BR>
reasonable to assume that death, which we have spent a thousand years
<BR>
turning into a materialist vacuum, is in fact not what we think. There's an
<BR>
enormous mystery hovering over our existence, that's only unraveled beyond
<BR>
the grave.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I would never in my life have thought that I would be pushed to this
<BR>
position. I spent the first half of my life getting away from this kind of
<BR>
thing. However, the evidence of the shamanic hallucinogens is in fact that
<BR>
shamans have always done what they do via ancestor magic and
<BR>
higher-dimensional perception, and that death is not what naive positivism
<BR>
in the last 300 years has attempted to say it is. I realize that it's
<BR>
incredible to suppose that here  at the apex of materialist, positivist,
<BR>
scientific civilization, we're going to make an orthogonal turn into an
<BR>
understanding of what lies beyond the grave, but in fact, this is probably
<BR>
the paradigm-shattering world-condensing event that is bearing down on us.&quot;
