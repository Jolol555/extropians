<EM>&gt; &gt; Pan Am 109, but cancelled his party's reservation an hour before takeoff

<EM>&gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt; Clue: here in Scotland, 90% of the informed opinion is that the Lockerbie

<EM>&gt; &gt; trial will deliver one of two verdicts -- &quot;not guilty&quot; or &quot;not proven&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I haddn't heard who was supposed to be on the flight, but I had heard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the defense had a supposed witness that claims a big US drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operation at the airport in question, who is most likely an IRA stalking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; horse (considering how much the IRA owes Gadaffi, I don't doubt it). I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't imagine that actual taped conversations of Gadaffi congradulating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the team would not make it an open and shut case.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course, such evidence would make it an open and shut case. But I hope
<BR>
you'll pardon me for doubting that evidence that hard exists; if it did,
<BR>
it'd have been produced by now (if only to shut up carping critics like
<BR>
myself :).
<BR>
<P>The person I was told was due to fly on Pan Am 109, incidentally, was
<BR>
'Pik' Botha, the South African minister of defense, and his entourage.
<BR>
<P>(Note that I don't have a documentary source for this to hand, so I'll
<BR>
have to do a lot of digging if you challenge me on it. So be it.)
<BR>
<P>If this isn't just synchronicity in action, I find the current South
<BR>
African government's mediation in getting the Libyans accused of the
<BR>
bombing a fair trial in a neutral country somewhat ... interesting.
