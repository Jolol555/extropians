<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To put forth an extropian view of things, I would propose a show about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a team of scientists and journalists who work for some sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; institute lead by a multi-billioniare who wants to steer humanity the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right way as it heads toward the singularity.  He is a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strong-minded optimist despite the obstacles the group encounters.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You would see the characters on tv and radio at times trying to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the right memes out to prepare humanity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The show would take place around roughly 2025, a few years before a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; singularity would be happening, so they would have access to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incredible technologies such as nanotech, VR, genetic engineering and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AI, but in the early stages.  One of the main characters would be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AI.  Of course, it would be important to have conflict for the sake of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the story so the institute could have an evil(or just misguided)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counterpart who battles them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why settle for one?  Sure, use a &quot;main&quot; counterpart, but the main enemy
<BR>
would be fear itself.  People are terrified of the unknown, and in a
<BR>
society where radical (by 19th, or even 20th, century standards) change
<BR>
happens every day, people come up with all kinds of approaches to deal
<BR>
with it.  Most, to be blunt, suck hard and fail.  World governments are
<BR>
left intact but less and less relevant, as their internal beauracracies
<BR>
inhibit their reactions to crises, giving the appearance that they no
<BR>
longer care for their citizens...and clearing the path for institutes
<BR>
like this one to, as some would (incorrectly) put it, protect humanity
<BR>
from itself.  Among episode possibilities:
<BR>
<P>* One enclave decides to prevent any &quot;new technology&quot; from crossing its
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;borders.  It fails utterly to prevent smuggling of nanotech stock, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a few young upstarts decide that it would be a cool prank to dissolve
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;city-hall-equivalent in grey goo as a protest, using recipies
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;downloaded through the 'Net.  One of their less tolerant members sets
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the timer to go off at noon, just as the mayor is holding a live
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;audience.  The institute steps in to stop this, and turns the protest
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;into a peaceful but effective one when their agents, having been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;through customs, demonstrates that they *still* have &quot;new tech&quot;.  With
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the impossibility of shutting it out demonstrated, they suggest
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;education as the key to being able to deal with it, and offer to help
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;set up an online briefing center for citizens to learn what they need
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to know.
<BR>
<P>* A group of enhanced humans go sociopath, with predictable (though not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fatal) results against unenhanced locals.  Institute does not have the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;firepower to take the gang down, but it can and does enhance the local
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(remaining) police...and then get the cops to use the fact of their
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;own upgrades to convince the group that they are not utterly alienated
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;from the rest of the human race.
<BR>
<P>* One of the agents dies and gets ressurected; local religious enclave
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(melding of several religions) arrests them for being agents of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;devil.  Court-drama argument from the books that the enclave worships;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which the institute actually demonstrates better knowledge of than the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;locals themselves - thanks to downloads from the AI, but also to an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis of the messages of peace and love that the authors of said
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;works were trying to communicate in the first place.  Religious
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;intolerance is utterly discredited in that enclave (thanks in part to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the media attention the former leaders were whipping up) by the time
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the agents are found innocent.  Emphasis on this point when the judge
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;finds the laws of intolerance utterly incompatible with the values of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the community, striking them from the books as &quot;immoral laws&quot; under
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the local constitution.
<BR>
<P>* One branch of institute is raided as a &quot;threat to national security&quot;,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which quickly becomes a blatant &quot;you're doing our job better than we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are; stop it&quot;.  Some of the agents upload themselves to waiting clones
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;at a remote facility, then suicide their
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;trapped-and-not-going-anywhere-soon-anyway arrested bodies.  One or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;two of the agents can't, but after some angst and worry, the prisoners
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- who consist of about 90% of the local population, thanks to some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lock-up-happy &quot;elected&quot; government - simply stop working on the prison
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;farms and burn the crops.  When the legislators make a personal visit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to find out why no more food is coming out, they start making more and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;more demands on the prisoners and declaring themselves lords.  The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;guards, who still have some democratic values in them, turn their guns
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;on the legislators.
<BR>
<P>* Agents encounter an area where paranoid secrecy is the rule.  They
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;investigate, and find that no one knows what the laws are.  Martial
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;law was supposedly declared, but the status of that declaration is on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a &quot;need to know&quot; basis; the local governor states outright that no one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;except himself needs to know.  Although he has delusions of power,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;thinly veiled with a facade of keeping the people safe which only he
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;believes, confusion and mild anarchy is the law of the land in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;practice.  After defusing a number of situations where questions of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;authority threaten lives (for instance, &quot;Am I cleared to give CPR to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;this person who's just had a heart attack?&quot;), agents explain the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;situation to governor's lieutenants, who had their own suspicions but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;were too afraid to talk to one another.  Lieutenants set to restoring
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the former order, with an emphasis on openness and self-determination.
<BR>
<P>* Briefing center from above gets subverted by propagandists, wrecking
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;its trust in the community.  Mayor begs institute to return.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Institute uses what little trust it still has to track down the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cause - same over-the-top anarchist as before.  Turns out he belongs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to an organization trying to discredit anything new in the eyes of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;public, so it can hoard the power to itself.  With the cause revealed,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the mayor puts in controls to let the community at large comment on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the information in the briefing center, so that any further propaganda
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;can be spotted and rejected before it ruins the peoples' trust.  But
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the institute now has a more tangible opponent...
<BR>
<P>Ok, the above could use with some improvement.  But are they what you
<BR>
were talking about?
