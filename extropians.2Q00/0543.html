<P><EM>    &gt;What I don't understand is why you're so much more afraid of big
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;government than big capital.
</EM><BR>
<P>Because big government has created a sea of blood and butchered
<BR>
hundreds of millions of people, often their own citizens. Granted, few
<BR>
companies actively opposed these monstrous regimes, but that's not
<BR>
quite the same thing as instigating it, and anyway can you really blame
<BR>
them for not playing the hero, it would be economic if not actual suicide
<BR>
to do so. Yes Microsoft can be arrogant and yes, it makes me mad
<BR>
when Windows crashes too, but at least Bill Gates doesn't shove his
<BR>
customers into ovens.
<BR>
<P>I just finished the new biography of John D Rockefeller by Ron Chernon
<BR>
called &quot;Titan&quot;, it was a good book but was supposed to document all the
<BR>
dreadful things he did to become the riches man in the world. Well, if this
<BR>
is as bad as capitalism gets I can only conclude capitalism is not very bad.
<BR>
He was very intelligent, very aggressive, and had the ability to find any
<BR>
economic weakness in a competitor and exploit it, but nothing wrong with
<BR>
that. It's true he sometimes bribed legislatures, but although clearly illegal
<BR>
I didn't find that immoral. At the time there were foolish (and probably
<BR>
unconstitutional) laws forbidding corporations from being involved in
<BR>
intra state commerce, if the law was obeyed the industrial revelation would
<BR>
not have happened in America, so he did the only thing he could, he opened his
<BR>
wallet. I could not find any instances where Rockefeller's business decisions
<BR>
were clearly immoral and only a few that were even entered a gray area.
<BR>
<P>It's funny, the book I read before this was a biography of Stalin, before
<BR>
that of Lenin and before that one on Hitler, so when Chernon talked about
<BR>
some &quot;evil&quot; thing that Rockefeller did I almost had to laugh. Compared to
<BR>
these government leaders Rockefeller on his worst day was no more
<BR>
than naughty.
