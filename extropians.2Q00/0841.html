</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Excellent post Octavio. If more people like yourself stood up for good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government and an open economy, I don't think it will be long until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mexico is on a political and economic par with the US and Canada.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, and well you should see how good has been the advancement of information
<BR>
technologies for us, I think we are really starting to catch up with the 
<BR>
usa and europe
<BR>
right now I'm working in a place that is developing a secret project, 
<BR>
unfortunately I
<BR>
can't say what it is, however top hackers from the usa have visited us, 
<BR>
trained us
<BR>
and left marveled about all the things we are doing here, not only that, 
<BR>
the wages
<BR>
treatment and facilities we have are on par with industrialized countries, 
<BR>
so guys
<BR>
stay tuned because this is gonna be big.
<BR>
<P>And I think that the emergence of projects like this will set up quite a 
<BR>
stir in our country
<BR>
I think that we have a pretty good chance of catching up in almost no time 
<BR>
with the newer
<BR>
technologies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Its rather entertaining to see the liberals up here squirm at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought of opening up the border with Mexico and treating your country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as an equal economic partner. The unions scream about NAFTA, yet they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have done nothing to try to expand their unionizing south of the border.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If they really cared about labor standards and employment practices
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they'd be down there backing demonstrations and reforms left and right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If the ecological groups were really interested in the enviornment down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there, they'd be funding Mexican environmental groups and buying media
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time there to raise awareness. Its rather interesting to see these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;groups who claim to be progressive actually making excuses why things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can't be done rather than how they should be done....
</EM><BR>
<P>I know, there are several things I've never understood about those groups as
<BR>
I've never understood drug war zealots.
<BR>
<P>There is something that makes me wonder
<BR>
if our goverments conspire together several times, why I think this? just look
<BR>
at peru, they said in washington they wouldn't recognize fujimori electoral 
<BR>
triumph
<BR>
if they didn't have elections again, however nobody has ever talked in the 
<BR>
us how
<BR>
helpful it would be for both countries if we had a true democracy and 
<BR>
respect for
<BR>
the citizens, however both goverments cover each other's back so issues 
<BR>
like these
<BR>
are taboo, this is very similar to me to the way our goverment lies to us 
<BR>
saying that
<BR>
pemex is of everybody and it would never be privatized because that would 
<BR>
meant
<BR>
we are selling the country to foreigners, however what they don't say is 
<BR>
that the
<BR>
oil of our country isn't ours, it's the goverment's and how would the 
<BR>
privatization of our
<BR>
oil industry would reduce, it's inefficience, it would improve it's 
<BR>
technology and it could make us
<BR>
an even major player in the oil industry, that without mention that stock 
<BR>
options would
<BR>
mean every employee really owns a part of the company meaning that now oil 
<BR>
would
<BR>
be truly owned by mexicans and not a single corrupt party that has been the 
<BR>
cancer
<BR>
of our country since 1929, however with an opposition party having a really 
<BR>
good chance of
<BR>
winning, it'll be very interesting to see how would the things change once 
<BR>
we achieve true
<BR>
democracy, and trust me the day that happens things will start to change 
<BR>
not here, but
<BR>
in the usa as well.
