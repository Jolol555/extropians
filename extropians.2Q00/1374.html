Anders writes, quoting Robin:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 3) Resolution required -- The spatial/chemical resolution of a scanning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; technology that would be required to sufficiently reliably distinguish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; between the types of neurons, and to distinguish which neurons connect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to which others via which kinds of synapses.  (Assume one is repeated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; slicing and scanning a cryogenically frozen brain.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We need to identify synapses, which means on the order of ~1 mu. At
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this resolution the morphological differences can probably be totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; characterized, but we need the ability to get the receptor types on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surfaces and possibly some chemical stuff from the inside too. I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think we need much smaller resolution, since then we get down into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; region where noise and diffusion play a significant role.
</EM><BR>
<P>If by mu you mean microns, I think you will have to go much smaller than
<BR>
that in order to accurately model neural behavior.  Synapse gaps are
<BR>
something like 10-20 nm, vessicles are 50-200 nm, and I think receptors
<BR>
are on the order of 10-50 nm or so.  You need a pretty full picture of
<BR>
the spatial density of the vessicles and receptors in order to model
<BR>
how the synapse will behave under depolarization.
<BR>
<P>The rest of the neural surface is important, too, in terms of how the
<BR>
polarization impulses will spread around the cell.  Then in order to
<BR>
model longer term behavior you probably need to model the microtubule
<BR>
distribution within the cells, and the rate of synthesis of replacement
<BR>
neurotransmitter, which will depend on overall metabolism.  An old cell
<BR>
may not be able to fire at the maximum rate indefinitely (I don't know
<BR>
for sure, but this seems plausible).
<BR>
<P>It's possible that you can substitute &quot;generic&quot; information for some
<BR>
or all of these factors and still get a good model.  Even if it is
<BR>
wrong for individual cells maybe the brain would behave roughly the
<BR>
same if all cells were like the average cell in terms of metabolism,
<BR>
transport rates, density of various receptors and transmitters, etc.
<BR>
But I suspect we would not get so lucky.
