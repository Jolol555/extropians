<P><EM> &gt; It is easier to detect smell differences than &quot;absolute smells&quot;, so a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; good first step in training oneself to act as a tracking dog is to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; cross smell tracks. If you walk along a street, slowly inhaling
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; through your nose you can detect the changes in the air when you cross
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the track of somebody else. It is a quite interesting pastime to try
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to &quot;see&quot; the world like a dog presumably does.
</EM><BR>
<P>Richard Feynmann had an anecdote on this very subject, but he said it was
<BR>
better if you moved around on all fours closer to the ground for the full
<BR>
dog experience. He also did an experiment where he got some friends to
<BR>
handle some books, and after smelling his friends hands and smelling the
<BR>
books he could match each person to the book they had handled.
