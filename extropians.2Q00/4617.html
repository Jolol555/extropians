<EM>&gt; In the chart you link to, the bonds are long term and were subject to more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years of inflation than deflation during the years covered.  This would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be the case with the strategy I suggested of buying only short term bonds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that T-bills are not a good investment for the long term.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As the standard deviations for the 3 asset classes indicate, stock returns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are far more volatile than returns on bonds.  If you take a smaller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assortment of stocks, which is what most people end up with, the volatility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be even greater.  Most people, if they purchase stocks for their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; portfolios, can't afford to diversify widely, and mutual fund managers don't
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually it is quite easy for anyone to diversify quite well, by buying into
<BR>
index funds or tracking stocks such as the QQQ that index for example 100
<BR>
stocks. You can also buy into the S&amp;P 500 if you want. So diversification
<BR>
is not a problem for anyone.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; seem to have all that good of a track record. Some volatility wouldn't hurt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you were prepared to hang on for the long term, it's true.  And a person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could transfer their money out of stocks and into bonds at retirement age
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they want to withdraw money periodically. But what if a person reached
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retirement age just as the market went into a slump of several years'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; duration? Also, some of the volatility which appears negligible on a chart
</EM><BR>
<P>They could sell a little bit of their portfolio for needed cash. In fact
<BR>
that is the whole point- the idea is not to instantly sell off all your
<BR>
stocks as soon as you retire. You want to only sell little pieces as
<BR>
needed and let the rest continue growing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; translates into rather severe losses for the individual investor.
</EM><BR>
<P>Losses aren't actual losses until you sell a stock.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your info comes closer to changing my mind than other stuff I've seen, Rob,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I'd still feel queasy advising someone to put their life savings into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the stockmarket.
</EM><BR>
<P>Obviously you don't want to just jump in without educating yourself quite
<BR>
a bit first. And even then you certainly don't want to jump in 100% unless
<BR>
you are youngish.

<EM>&gt; Subject: Investing (long term returns)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; See, for example, <A HREF="http://www.dljdirect.com/hti_t01.htm">http://www.dljdirect.com/hti_t01.htm</A> , for a quick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; table comparing inflation-adjusted returns for various asset classes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Over the long run, stock strategies such as buying the S&amp;P 500 index
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whomp investments in either bonds or short-term instruments, or cash,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adjusted for inflation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are perhaps reasons why one might choose not to invest in US stocks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but over the long haul, net net returns and inflation resistance aren't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; among
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them.  Short term instruments (T-bills, commercial paper, cash) are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particularly poor investments over the long term, even during inflationary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; periods [though less so then long-term debt during the same period if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need to trade the bonds during the bout of inflation]).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These market behaviors  are USA-specific.  I don't know of any comparable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; measures for non-USA investment environments but I'm sure they could be dug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up.  Financial markets outside the USA have historically tended to be more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; volatile (risky) for various reasons, such as lower liquidity, increased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political risk, and others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course, dissenting views exist. See, for example,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/newsclips/5912206a.htm">http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/newsclips/5912206a.htm</A>  (Google is my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; friend)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Disclaimer: I work for a Wall Street firm in asset management (but on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not sales!)
