<P>Zeno's Quantum Paradox Reversed: Watching A Flying Arrow Increase Its Speed 
<BR>
<P>Is motion an illusion? Can&quot;glimpses&quot; freeze radioactive decay? 
<BR>
For over 2,500 years, scientists and philosophers have been grappling with 
<BR>
Zeno of Elea's famous paradox. More recently, scientists believed that the 
<BR>
counterpart of this paradox, known as the quantum Zeno paradox, is realizable 
<BR>
in the microscopic world governed by quantum physics. Now, scientists from 
<BR>
the Weizmann Institute of Science have shown that in most cases, the quantum 
<BR>
Zeno paradox should not take place. An article describing the calculations 
<BR>
that lead to this surprising conclusion appears in today's Nature. The 
<BR>
article is also surveyed in the journal's News and Views section. 
<BR>
<P>The Greek philosopher Zeno, who lived in the 5th Century B.C., decades before 
<BR>
Socrates, dedicated his life's work to showing the logical paradoxes inherent 
<BR>
to the idea of indefinite divisibility in space and time (i.e., that every 
<BR>
line is composed of an infinite number of points). One of these paradoxes is 
<BR>
known as the arrow paradox: if the motion of a flying arrow is divided ad 
<BR>
infinitum, then during each of these infinitesimal moments, the arrow is at 
<BR>
rest. The sum of an infinity of zeroes remains zero, and therefore the arrow 
<BR>
cannot move. One can imagine how someone giving a flying arrow quick, 
<BR>
repeated glimpses, can actually freeze it in place. Zeno inferred from this 
<BR>
that movement cannot happen. Indeed, he was a true follower of Parmenides, 
<BR>
his teacher and mentor, who advocated that any change in nature is but an 
<BR>
illusion. 
<BR>
<P>This philosophical view was rejected by Aristotle, as well as by scientists 
<BR>
and philosophers of the 19th century, who resolved Zeno's paradox by showing 
<BR>
that non-zero velocity can exist in the limit of infinitesimal divisions of a 
<BR>
trajectory. However, the paradox was bolstered in the 1960s by the physicist 
<BR>
Leonid A. Khalfin, working in the former USSR, and by physicists E.C.G. 
<BR>
Sudarshan and Baidyanath Misra, working in the USA during the 1970s. Using 
<BR>
quantum theory, they concluded that if an &quot;observer&quot; makes repeated quick 
<BR>
observations of a microscopic object undergoing changes in time, it is highly 
<BR>
probable that the object will indeed stop changing. The frequent observations 
<BR>
divide the trajectory along which the object evolves into infinitesimal 
<BR>
segments in which there is no change. In other words, in the quantum world an 
<BR>
observer can freeze the evolution of an object, in accordance with Zeno's 
<BR>
paradox. 
<BR>
<P>Skeptics who doubted those calculations must have been genuinely surprised 
<BR>
when, in 1990, Colorado University physicist John Wineland proved in an 
<BR>
experiment that &quot;freezing glimpses&quot; do work in the real world (or at least in 
<BR>
a &quot;simple&quot; world with only two energy levels). Ever since, physicists have 
<BR>
been struggling to understand the implications of the experiment. Can the 
<BR>
Zeno paradox, for example,&quot;glimpse-freeze&quot; radioactive nuclear decay, thus 
<BR>
stopping radiation? The prevailing answer during the past 30 years has been 
<BR>
that such a freeze should be possible, provided the successive observations 
<BR>
are made frequently enough. 
<BR>
<P>Prof. Gershon Kurizki and Dr. Abraham Kofman of the Weizmann Institute of 
<BR>
Science have recently shown that, for better or for worse, such &quot;freezing&quot; 
<BR>
does not take place in reality, and decay cannot actually be stopped by 
<BR>
&quot;bombarding&quot; the system with glimpses. According to their calculations, the 
<BR>
ability to &quot;freeze&quot; changes through quick glimpses depends on the ratio 
<BR>
between the memory time of the decay, and the time interval between 
<BR>
successive observations. Every process of decay has a memory time. In the 
<BR>
case of radioactive decay, for instance, this is the period in which the 
<BR>
radiation has not yet escaped from the atom, allowing the system to 
<BR>
&quot;remember&quot; its state prior to the decay. The memory time in a radiative decay 
<BR>
process of an excited atom (an atom occupying an unstable energy level) is 
<BR>
less than one billionth of a billionth of a second. To &quot;freeze&quot; this decay, 
<BR>
the observations would have to be at intervals of much less than a billionth 
<BR>
of a billionth of a second. 
<BR>
<P>However, a sequence of observations so close in time would cause the 
<BR>
appearance of new particles, changing the system completely and destroying 
<BR>
it, and thus the question of stopping the decay would become meaningless. On 
<BR>
the other hand, if the time interval between observations is longer than the 
<BR>
decay's memory time, the rate of decay and radiation is actually increased. 
<BR>
Not only does Zeno's paradox not take effect in such a case but there is 
<BR>
actually an opposite effect: the &quot;anti-Zeno effect&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>Prof. Kurizki: &quot;In other words, if we make the analogy between an object 
<BR>
undergoing changes in time, for example a decaying nucleus or an excited 
<BR>
atom, and Zeno's moving arrow, the arrow will increase its speed as the rate 
<BR>
of the 'glimpses' increases. The surprising conclusion of this research is 
<BR>
that the anti-Zeno effect (i.e., the increase of decay through frequent 
<BR>
observations) can occur in all processes of decay, while the original Zeno 
<BR>
effect, which would slow down and even stop decay, requires conditions that 
<BR>
only rarely exist in such processes.&quot; 
<BR>
<P><P>Professor Gershon Kurizki is the holder of the George W. Dunne Chair of 
<BR>
Chemical Physics.
