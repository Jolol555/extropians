</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;May
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;06, 2000 12:41 AM,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hmm.  I had not considered that.  If that is what Eugene had in mind, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't suppose I could argue with that.  I find it difficult to imagine a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; replica of me that is exact in every way, yet still not having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consciousness.  But if it could somehow be done, and the copy was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;terminated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; before the last step of igniting the consciousness, then moral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ly I don't suppose I'd have a problem with that.  Although I still 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that would raise a sticky *ethical* issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To keep the record straight, I don't think Eugene agreed with my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interpretation.  But in my mind, if the copy is still being artificially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;caused to have the same thoughts as the original, instead of being allowed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to directly experience the world and generate its own thoughts, then I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not consider it conscious yet.  I would think that the process of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;artificially causing it to keep in synch with the original was part of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;original creation/copying process.  As soon as it is disconnected from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;machinery that control its sensory input to match the original's, and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;starts perceiving the world from its own viewpoint, then it becomes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;independently conscious in my opinion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I believe that Eugene's &quot;copy&quot; must be kept in synch with the original, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else he no longer considers it to be an identical copy.  I don't think he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believe in killing a copy as soon as it has had its first independent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought.  In this sense, I am not sure that different participants really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disagree on when a copy can be killed and when it becomes an independent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being who should not be killed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course, under that scenario, it seems we all agree.  If the copies (how 
<BR>
ever many of them there are) are completely in synch at all times, then as 
<BR>
long as *they* decide that one or more of them can be eliminated, that is 
<BR>
nothing worse than suicide.  And, for those who want to do that, I have no 
<BR>
problem with it at all.
