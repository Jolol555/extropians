<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Stock brokers use PDAs a lot, especially on trading floors, that are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;customized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for stock trading. I'm sure their enthusiasm with this specific application 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whats behind the hype, as if the rest of us need it or want it. I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't get how you can get a reliable amount of info displayed on those puny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little things. Anyone care to comment?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure what you mean by a &quot;reliable&quot; amount of info, but if the info 
<BR>
is high-quality, it doesn't necessarily need to be high-quantity.  Most of 
<BR>
what you see on your PC monitor when browsing the web is unecessary 
<BR>
surplussage.  Logos, pictures, ads, fancy colors.  All you really need is 
<BR>
the data.  For instance I use my Palm all the time for driving directions 
<BR>
downloaded from MapQuest.  What I get is just the facts (&quot;turn left here, go 
<BR>
straight for 10 miles&quot; etc.) without all the ads, and unecessary hyperlinks.
<BR>
<P>I don't know about you, but I love having the phone number and address of 
<BR>
*everyone* I know with me at all times.  Palms are ideal for that and not 
<BR>
bad at helping you keep track of your calendaring schedule as well.  It's 
<BR>
not great for email, since data entry is still a pain.  But for reading the 
<BR>
news its also pretty cool.  I also keep mine up to date with all the movies 
<BR>
playing in my area so if I decide at the drop of a hat to go see, say, 
<BR>
Gladiator I can find out instantly where its playing near me and what time 
<BR>
it starts next.
<BR>
<P>Although its largely like any other technology.  If you have it you find 
<BR>
stuff to do with it.  If you don't, you can live with out it.  I still have 
<BR>
friends who have never owned a PC (if you can believe *that*) and they don't 
<BR>
miss it at all.  Me, if I didn't have access to a PC at least once a day I'd 
<BR>
be lost.
<BR>
