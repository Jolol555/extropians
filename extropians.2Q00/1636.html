<EM>&gt; The idea that the poverty of the 30's was because people got too good at growing

<EM>&gt; food that people could eat and too good at manufacturing products that people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could use is just too silly to debate.
</EM><BR>
<P>This was a common perception at the time of the reason for the economic
<BR>
slowdown.  I think John is right that it is largely a myth.
<BR>
<P>However what happened during the 1920's is that there had been large
<BR>
postwar increases in productivity which had not produced corresponding
<BR>
drops in prices.  This meant that there was a sort of &quot;hidden inflation&quot;
<BR>
going on.  Prices were higher than they would have been in a free market,
<BR>
but because of the increased productivity they hadn't actually changed
<BR>
much.  But the effect is similar to inflation, in that people got the
<BR>
wrong signals about the proper level of investment.  The economy got
<BR>
over-stimulated and a correction was necessary.
<BR>
<P>I've read some books about the era and it is sad to see how well-
<BR>
intentioned programs just made things worse.  People were really baffled
<BR>
over why the economy was doing so badly, and everyone had his pet
<BR>
theories.  Factories were idle because goods were stacked in warehouses.
<BR>
Men did not work because jobs were scarce.  And people couldn't buy
<BR>
goods because so many were unemployed.  It was a vicious cycle and
<BR>
no one understood which were the causes and which the effects.
