<EM>&gt; Any infrastructure facilities are strategic targets. TV station =
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propaganda and military coordination capability that was in fact seized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the milosevik government. The commuter train happened to be crossing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a bridge that was targeted, the train was not the target.
</EM><BR>
<P>No time to comment on everything this morning, but the above point of view
<BR>
clearly means Lorrey means anything and everything can be redefined as a
<BR>
military target.  In other words, any war is always total war and any nation
<BR>
engaging in war that thinks it has right on its side -- and what nation
<BR>
going to war claims it doesn't -- can bomb and kill indiscriminately.
<BR>
<P>I recall the bombing of the train bridge.  The pilot saw the train after
<BR>
dropping his first load and went back and bombed again.  The NATO spokesman
<BR>
claimed, &quot;He bombed in good faith.&quot;  What, pray tell, would bombing in &quot;bad
<BR>
faith&quot; be?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There was a very good documentary done on Dresden not too long ago. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; British were the ones who specifically ran a two wave HE and incindiary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mission against Dresden, while the Americans came along later with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; targeted mission against a neighboring military facility.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Soviets actually asked the British and Americans to target the city.
<BR>
Tens of thousands were killed.  The military targets in Dresden were road
<BR>
and rail centers.  In order to minimize civilian and refugee deaths, all
<BR>
that would have been necessary was targeting these outside the city.  The
<BR>
bombing took place in February of 1945.  The war ended a few months later.
<BR>
This was not material to ending the war -- any more than turning over people
<BR>
to the Soviets after the war was material to keeping the peace.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, are you saying the Germans were housing POWs in the city, as human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shields? That, in itself, is a war crime.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Germans, to my knowledge, did not know Dresden was going to be bombed.
<BR>
Up until February of 1945, to my knowledge, Dresden had never been heavily
<BR>
bombed AND it was not a military center -- being mainly an &quot;arts&quot; Mecca.
<BR>
<P>[big snip I'll to get to later...]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; We don't kill the kids.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who is this &quot;we&quot;?  Is Lorrey calling the shots down at the Pentagon?
<BR>
<P>[another big snip I'll to get to later...]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Notably, Saddam has not been stopped.  He continues to rule and seek
</EM><BR>
ways to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; expand his power, the coalition against fell apart mainly because of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; US's and Britain's highhanded policy in the region, and the general
</EM><BR>
lesson
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; every other nation and people is being taught is that might makes right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Kosovo is much the same.  Milosevic is still in power, now the KLA is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; killing Kosovar Serbs, the genocide that never was is generally ignored
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because it's not news, Serbia might be bombed out but it's army is
</EM><BR>
intact,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and Russia used the American strategy to its advantage in Chechnya.
</EM><BR>
(How
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the two -- Chechnya and Yugoslavia -- are different is one that will
</EM><BR>
have to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be explained to me.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, there is little difference, with the sole exception being that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Serbs started killing ethnic albanians first,
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I recall some 45 people were killed before the bombings began.  And, of
<BR>
course, the claims of the KLA Are to be beleived while any Serb sources are
<BR>
total liars.  Genocide on a scale to match...  Waco not Hitler.  I suppose
<BR>
that justifies bombing all of Yugoslavia AND killing thousands of civilians
<BR>
in the process.
<BR>
<P>Also, the bombing against Yugoslavia seems to not have stopped the killings
<BR>
in the region, but escalated them.  Was this the goal?  I don't think so.
<BR>
One should, after all, go to war with the notion to making things better.
<BR>
In other words, one fights because one thinks that the peace afterwards will
<BR>
be better than the peace before the fight.  This should make war the means
<BR>
to a higher end and actual military actions can then be measured against
<BR>
whether they work toward this end or detract from it.
<BR>
<P>Yugoslavia is interesting in another way.  The US had no vital interest
<BR>
there.  It did not affect any US allies in a big way.  (If it did, why has
<BR>
the trouble in the Balkans for the last ten years not bothered them?)  Also,
<BR>
US policy in the region has been markedly pro-Islamic and pro-German.  I'm
<BR>
not trying to bring a conspiracy angle in here, but it's strange to see the
<BR>
US standing by while Croatia cleansed itself of Serbs by the tens of
<BR>
thousands, while not being able stand Serbia hold on to Kosovo and the death
<BR>
toll being orders of magnitude smaller.  (Croatia is a nation which
<BR>
celebrates its alliance to Nazi Germany and exterminated approximately a
<BR>
third of its population during WW2.  This does NOT mean I'm prepared to
<BR>
support a bombing campaign against Croatia TV and rail lines, civilians or
<BR>
no.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; while in Chechnya, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Chechens started killing Russians first. While Serbia is small enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we can do something about it, there is little we can do about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Russia except diplomatic protests.
</EM><BR>
<P>My point was that Russia could make the same claims about Chechnya that
<BR>
Lorrey could make about Yugoslavia.  In fact, the Russian policy with the
<BR>
Near Abroad and breakaway republics like Chechnya and Ingushtia has been to
<BR>
claim that ethnic Russians are being persecuted -- a claim not completely
<BR>
without merit -- and use this as a pretext for intervention.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It's a shame that the American people will have to pay for these
</EM><BR>
mistakes --
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and not the politicians who make them.  But that's the nature of the
</EM><BR>
beast.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How are we going to pay for them?
</EM><BR>
<P>Americans will pay through blood and treasure, of course.  With the former,
<BR>
there is terrorism and war which will claim American lives.  I'm not saying
<BR>
this is a justification for this, but merely human nature.  The orphaned
<BR>
Iraqi or Serbian kid who turns to terrorism is not going to think about
<BR>
morality the same way Lorrey (I hope!) and I do.  He or she is mostly going
<BR>
to be motivated by revenge against the US.  That urge would not be there if
<BR>
the US had either a) stayed the f*ck out it or b) been a little more
<BR>
restrained and civilized in flexing its muscles.
<BR>
<P>The treasure part includes property lost to terrorism and war as well as
<BR>
taxes paid to fund the current policy of military adventurism of the US.
<BR>
But also, the price will be paid in many other ways -- a less stable world,
<BR>
for one.
<BR>
<P>Later!
