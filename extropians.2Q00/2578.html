<EM>&gt; &gt; Gould has an axe to grind in that book.  He seems to promote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the notion that there is no legitimate measure of absolute intelligence:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  therefore the whole idea of  I.Q. is misguided.  I disagree with him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  on that. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hope the ax is gettin' sharper. I totally agree with him, IQ scoring is a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bogus idea. However, it's the measuring techniques are suspect, not the level 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I think the biggest problem with IQ measurements is that they are very
<BR>
poor at resolving the delta between theoretical and effective
<BR>
intelligence.  Theoretical IQ (what they usually measure, since it is
<BR>
relatively easy to create metrics) appears to isolate specific processing
<BR>
cortices.  Unfortunately, I think effective IQ is determined more by how
<BR>
well all the parts work together.  I've met a lot of people with high IQs
<BR>
that exhibited rather average intelligence in practice, and people with
<BR>
average IQs that exhibit above average intelligence in practice.
<BR>
<P>We are very good at measuring the theoretical capacity of many
<BR>
aspects of the brain, but are very poor at measuring how much capacity is
<BR>
lost due to inefficiencies in the complex integration of these abilities
<BR>
i.e. the performance of the network is as important as the peformance of
<BR>
the processor at each node.  Average parts and excellent integration may
<BR>
produce as good or better results than excellent parts and average
<BR>
integration.
<BR>
<P>I do think that concepts such as &quot;emotional intelligence&quot; are really weak
<BR>
attempts to create metrics for integration aspects of intelligence.  In
<BR>
other words, the &quot;multiple intelligence&quot; people may be tangentially
<BR>
correct in spite of themselves.
