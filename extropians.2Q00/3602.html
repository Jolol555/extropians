<P>
I had occasion this weekend to view the test FLIR, and the
<BR>
best version of the 1993 Waco FLIR I've ever seen. It would
<BR>
appear that glass shards did reflect sunlight in the test,
<BR>
and some of the flashes do look like gunfire on the test
<BR>
FLIR. But a terrible problem was immediately visible. In
<BR>
the videotape of the test in the possession of Davidian
<BR>
lawyers, the ground behind the shooters is so bright as to
<BR>
be up to 100% white. So how are you supposed to see a white
<BR>
flash against a white background? The answer is you can't.
<BR>
The camera also wasn't as zoomed-in as in the 1993 FLIR.
<BR>
<P>The ground in the 1993 Waco FLIR is around 40 to 60% black,
<BR>
but the ground behind shooters in the test FLIR is up to
<BR>
100% white, totally obscuring the ability to see most shots.
<BR>
However, a few shots are visible when some darker ground
<BR>
happens to be behind a shooter, and video clips in the
<BR>
CD-version of the VDS report do show some visible shots,
<BR>
and the ground is a little darker than on the videotape.
<BR>
The temperature was around 20 degrees cooler on the test-
<BR>
FLIR day, and so the ground should have been darker than
<BR>
seen in the 1993 FLIR. The fact that the ground is instead
<BR>
measured as being hotter on a cooler day indicates that
<BR>
the settings on the test FLIR were different. It's worth
<BR>
noting that some shooters were as white as the bright ground
<BR>
at times, disappearing into it. Some shooters were black.
<BR>
<P>In contrast to the no-contrast background behind test gunshots,
<BR>
the ground upon which the debris was placed was pitch black,
<BR>
and thus was much cooler than the ground behind the shooters.
<BR>
This causes the sunlight reflections to stand about against
<BR>
a black background, dramatically emphasizing them, the exact
<BR>
opposite of the no-contrast background behind the shooters,
<BR>
which effectively disappears the gunshots. The dramatic
<BR>
difference of the backgrounds behind the test gunshots and
<BR>
the test debris is grounds for a re-test, this time with
<BR>
identical thermal backgrounds for both debris and gunshots.
<BR>
<P>What is most disturbing is that analysis of close-up photos
<BR>
of the debris area before the test proves that they placed a
<BR>
tarp only over the debris area, keeping it in the shade, and
<BR>
they sprayed the debris area down with cool water, which is
<BR>
why the debris area appeared to be pitch black, or cool, to
<BR>
the FLIR. This is prima facie evidence of an intent to bias
<BR>
the test results by allowing full contrast for any debris
<BR>
reflections versus no contrast for the gunshots, a clear
<BR>
effort to obscure the gunshots and emphasize reflections.
