<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Billy Brown&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bbrown@transcient.com?Subject=Re:%20Transparent%20Society%20(WAS:%20RE:%20law%20enforcement%20for%20profit)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000506202354.6465.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">bbrown@transcient.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Loosely speaking, the capacity of any society to implement a universal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance system would be proportional to per capita wealth times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;available technology. Less obviously, the ability of the same society to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;implement security measures is determined by exactly the same equation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Security vs. surveillance is an arms race, just like projective penetration
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ability vs. armor stopping power. That isn't obvious, because until 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the natural defenses provided by geography, biology and (most of all) human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information processing capacity were sufficient to make any attempt at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;universal surveillance a hopeless task. But these limits are fixed, so as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technology improves they will gradually become insignificant and the arms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;race effect will come to predominate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Unless some unforeseen technology emerges to give one side to the that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dramatic advantage, surveillance appears to be a typical arms race case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Neither &quot;attack&quot; nor &quot;defense&quot; has a large inherent advantage, so the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;victor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will depend on circumstances. Keeping what you do in public a secret will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;almost impossible, but keeping what happens in your house a secret is a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;easier problem. Many of the places people are most interested in keeping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;private (small enclosed spaces, virtual worlds, personal records and online
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;activity) are inherently quite easy to defend against surveillance, unless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you have the government outlaw defensive technologies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;All in all, I see no reason to predict a big win for either side in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;struggle based purely on the evolution of technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think some on the list misunderstand how feel about surveillance.  I don't 
<BR>
think *absolute* surveillance will be needed for the foreseeable future.  
<BR>
There are some zones of privacy which should always be held inviolable.  I 
<BR>
don't believe the government or anyone else has a legitimate interest in 
<BR>
such intimacies as the goings on under your bedsheets or while tending to 
<BR>
your various, er, biological needs.
<BR>
<P>You recognize that: &quot;Keeping what you do in public a secret will be almost 
<BR>
impossible.&quot;  That in essence is all I have been saying.  The only 
<BR>
surveillance outside of this which I would not have a problem with is that 
<BR>
surveillance which is necessary to keep you from doing me harm with 
<BR>
impunity.  For instance, if you are a powerful government official, you 
<BR>
should essentially live in fish bowl.  Virtually all your communications 
<BR>
should be a matter of public record.  Similarly, if you happen to have 
<BR>
possession of a &quot;near-anything&quot; device which you could use to turn my 
<BR>
neighborhood into gray goo, I believe there should be some means of 
<BR>
determing exactly what you do with it, even if you only use it in the 
<BR>
privacy of your home.
<BR>
<P>There's no need to worry.  If I'm in charge, your bedrooms are still safe.
<BR>
