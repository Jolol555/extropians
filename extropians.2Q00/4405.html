<P>
While I tend to suspect the UrbanLegends people to be willing to label anything
<BR>
they don't like as a legend, there is also a good source, concerning the gun
<BR>
issue in general called <A HREF="http://www.guncite.com">http://www.guncite.com</A> that does a pretty good job of
<BR>
documenting false 'quotes'.
<BR>
<P>However this quote does bear a striking resemblance to FBI and HRT documents
<BR>
released to law enforcement agencies last year in preparation for Y2K, that were
<BR>
meant to help law enforcement profile potential suspects of any Y2K incidents
<BR>
that might occur. Those documents have been well researched as being authentic,
<BR>
and I can imagine that such a release might have a cover statement signed by
<BR>
Reno that does not contain this verbiage, but is included to endorce the
<BR>
remainder of the publication. To some people I would imagine that this indicates
<BR>
her endorsement of those statements that she may or may not have been aware of.
<BR>
Since she is Louis Freeh's superior, she is, after all, ultimately responsible
<BR>
for the statements and actions of those departments and individuals under her.
<BR>
<P>Here is another false quote attributed to Reno:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcbogus.html">http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcbogus.html</A>
<BR>
<P>whic contains the following:
<BR>
&lt;&lt;The &quot;B'nai B'rith&quot; speech by &quot;Janet Reno&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The most effective means of fighting crime in the United States is to
<BR>
outlaw the possession of any type of firearm by the civilian populace.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---Falsely attributed to Janet Reno, then-state attorney for
<BR>
Dade County, speech to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida B'nai B'rith gathering, ca.1991. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This supposed &quot;quote&quot; first got national attention when it appeared in the
<BR>
April 1995 issue of Soldier of Fortune, as part of an article by Mike Williams
<BR>
entitled &quot;Citizen Militias: '...Necessary to  the Security of a Free State...' &quot;
<BR>
and was picked up by the New York Times Syndicate as part of their coverage of
<BR>
the militia movement in the wake of the bombing in Oklahoma City. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to editorials by Martin Dyckman, published in the St. Petersburg
<BR>
Times May 2 and May 28, 1995, the &quot;quote&quot; appears to have originated with an
<BR>
affidavit written by Fred Diamond of Miami, FL who claimed to have heard Reno
<BR>
speak in Coral Gables (not Fort Lauderdale) &quot;on or about November 1, 1984&quot;.
<BR>
According to Diamond's affidavit, &quot;Janet Reno told the members of our group
<BR>
assembled, that waiting periods were only a step, that registration was only a
<BR>
step, and further that the prohibition of the private ownership of firearms was
<BR>
the only ultimate solution to controlling crime. I was shocked and appalled to
<BR>
hear her, an elected public official sworn to uphold and defend the
<BR>
Constitution, espouse and advocate a position that would effectively repeal the
<BR>
guarantees of the Second Amendment.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in 1993, after Reno was nominated to be Attorney General, Diamond
<BR>
talked to Marion Hammer, then the National Rifle Association's Florida lobbyist,
<BR>
and NRA sent him affidavits to sign. Diamond says he rejected their first draft.
<BR>
Subsequently, Hammer's newsletter, Florida Firing Line, published an article on
<BR>
Reno in March 1993, including almost word for word the key passage from
<BR>
Diamond's affidavit about what Reno allegedly said, but the newsletter put the
<BR>
speech in 1991, not 1984. Diamond didn't sign the affidavit (with the correct
<BR>
year) until June 17,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1993, after Reno had already been confirmed. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reno has been questioned about the &quot;quote&quot; and denies having said it, either
<BR>
in 1991 or 1984. A spokesman for the Justice Department, Bert Brandenburg, told
<BR>
the New York Times syndicate: &quot;The assertion is untrue and the attorney general
<BR>
has never made such a statement&quot; (Cleveland Plain Dealer, May 2, 1995). The Reno
<BR>
&quot;quote&quot; has appeared in print elsewhere, including National Review on May 29,
<BR>
1995 as part of an article by Alan W. Bock about the militia movement; and was
<BR>
reprinted in a Guns and Ammo editorial by Ed Moats on concealed carry in October
<BR>
of 1996. &gt;&gt; 
<BR>
<P>end quoted material....
<BR>
<P>It seems as though there may be intentional quote forging going on, that is
<BR>
eerily reminiscent of the forgeries used by anti-semites in the late 19th and
<BR>
early 20th centuries called &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, a pamplet
<BR>
which was apparently intended as a slur against an Abbey of Sion in Sion,
<BR>
Switzerland, similar to the treatment of the Templars in an earlier age... These
<BR>
forgeries were the primary propaganda weapons of Hitler and Goebbels.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; This came across as so extreme I had to look it up.

<EM>&gt; which claims this &quot;quote&quot; has been passed around the net since at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1994;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; It's a hoax. According to CBS, Janet Reno did not appear on 60 Minutes in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 1994. More to the point, even if she had made such an appearance and even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; if she did hold this unlikely opinion, the Attorney General would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; have dared publicly utter such impolitic words, which essentially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; consign every practicing Christian in the United States to the status of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &quot;cultist&quot; and a &quot;threat&quot; to the society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (not that I'd necessarily agree that she wouldn't have &quot;dared publicly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; utter such impolitic words&quot;, given her degree of political cluelessness,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but if she had, I suspect we'd have long since heard the uproar through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mainstream media.  Not that the quote isn't believable.)

<EM>&gt;  &gt; Yea .. we need cameras everywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &quot;A cultist is one who has a strong belief in the Bible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; and the Second Coming of Christ; who frequently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; attends Bible studies; who has a high level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; financial giving to a Christian cause; who home
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; schools for their children; who has accumulated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; survival foods and has strong belief in the Second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Amendment; and who distrusts big government.  Any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; these may qualify a person as a cultist but certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; more than one of these would cause us to look at this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; person as a threat and his family as being in a risk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; situation that qualifies for government interference.&quot;
