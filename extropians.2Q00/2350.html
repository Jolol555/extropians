<P>
Today I attended a roundtable discussion on the future of humanity.  It 
<BR>
occurred at my local college, the University of Alaska, Anchorage(Go 
<BR>
Seawolves!!).  Last week the topic was on philosophy and complexity theory 
<BR>
and there was a large showing and some fascinating as well as heated 
<BR>
discussion.
<BR>
<P>This week(the last one) only four people showed up!! And when we had such a 
<BR>
great topic!  Myself, Professor Maleko(chemistry), Professor Jacobs(history) 
<BR>
and Professor Beebee(mathematics).  Last week over two dozen people showed 
<BR>
up!  I missed the head of the bio department who is very outspoken and a 
<BR>
proto-extropian.
<BR>
<P>For the first time(in two years) the presentation was videotaped!  I went to 
<BR>
the university audio/visual dept. and begged them to record it.  We settled 
<BR>
on them loaning me a camera and tripod after I convinced them the topic was 
<BR>
worth taping.  The a/v guy was sick that he couldn't attend also because his 
<BR>
favorite prof(Jacobs-history) would be there.
<BR>
<P>I felt it was a good discussion but had hoped for more.  Prof. Maleko who 
<BR>
was the moderator started out by bringing up AI, computing, bio-engineering 
<BR>
and even uploading.  But the other two professors lead the discussion into 
<BR>
more conservative paths.  I admit to being somewhat deferential to 
<BR>
professors(I don't like to interrupt them) and so I didn't make many of the 
<BR>
points I wanted to in a attempt to bring up extropian topics).  I spoke a 
<BR>
lot less then I would have wanted to. Again, I wish the head of the bio 
<BR>
dept. (he looks like he could be Max's cousin) had been there.  The man has 
<BR>
No Problem interrupting to get a thought of his across!
<BR>
<P>We mainly discussed the &quot;birth dearth&quot; on the developing world, the nature 
<BR>
and accuracy of future scenario modeling, and how computing and the internet 
<BR>
is changing things.
<BR>
<P>At the conclusion, Prof. Maleko talked about how he hopes to get a grant so 
<BR>
he can bring up notable people from outside the state.  I would love to see 
<BR>
Max and Natasha, Robert Bradbury, Robin Hanson, or another outspoken 
<BR>
extropian come and speak here.  Funding may not come through though, and I 
<BR>
don't know how willing some of you would be to fly up here at your own 
<BR>
expense.  Free housing and food could certainly be arranged.
<BR>
<P>If an extropian did come up to speak I would take it upon myself to 
<BR>
advertise it to the maximum(flyers, radio, weekly popular press) and get the 
<BR>
word out.  Alaska is a beautiful place and one that is well worth visiting.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John
