I always seem to jump in threads that i've got no interest in 
<BR>
participating.  but in any case:
<BR>
<P>* Michael S. Lorrey &lt;<A HREF="mailto:retroman@turbont.net?Subject=Re:%20Commie%20Nonsense&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000619052158.C882@localhost.localdomain&gt;">retroman@turbont.net</A>&gt; [000617 13:14]:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; can provide the means'. What is it you don't understand about the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that more people live at a much higher standard of living where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capitalism is king than in any other nation? Capitalism is obviously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing a much better job than your Marxism.
</EM><BR>
<P>where do you get your data from?  if you mean capitalism as in free 
<BR>
market, there isn't any country in the world that fits the description, 
<BR>
and the same goes for Marxism if you mean communism.  
<BR>
<P>If you go by approximations, you would have to define some sort of
<BR>
scale.  I suggest the following crude measurement which i have only
<BR>
toyed with, but which seems to serve the purpose (getting quick
<BR>
simplistic comparisons) quite well which is the ratio of government
<BR>
expenditure to national GDP (i like it because they are the same units,
<BR>
seems to distill any kind of political system from the answer (it
<BR>
doesn't matter if its dictatorial or democratic) and it feels like it's
<BR>
measuring the right things). 
<BR>
<P>i happen to only know the numbers for two countries: Australia (25-28%)
<BR>
and Argentina (15-16%).  By feel (coincidentally, i've lived for more
<BR>
than 10 years in each of those countries), Argentina feels much more
<BR>
free market (lack of government handouts, much lower, flatter taxes,
<BR>
much less hassling with council standards, etc).  I'm almost sure i
<BR>
don't have to explain which one is economically better off.  I couldn't
<BR>
find a list of this ratio for other countries in a quick search through
<BR>
the web but if anyone's got numbers for other countries i'd like to hear
<BR>
what they are (especially for the US, sweden, japan and a sprinkle of
<BR>
'third-worlders').
<BR>
<P>Personally i'm undecided.  Instictively, it feels like the free market 
<BR>
types should win, but i don't have enough data (and the only data i do 
<BR>
have doesn't fit the hypothesis).
