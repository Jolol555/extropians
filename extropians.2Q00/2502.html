<EM>&gt; I have to admit this pursuit by Mike Lorrey to find out all he can about Michael Powers(Zero) is getting kind of surrealistic.

<EM>&gt; Zero wrote in response to Senator Mike &quot;Joe McCarthy&quot; lorrey:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My name (for the I-don't-know-how-manyth time) is Michael Powers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;What are you hiding?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am not *hiding* anything.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Who do you work for?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am self employed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Are you a convict?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Are you a sexual predator?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Are you a fugitive?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Are you a communist or socialist?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Zero continued:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I post to this list I expect my opinions to stand or fall on their own merits, not on who I am or who people think I am.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike, the correct phrasing is &quot;are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?&quot;  A rotten former commie could get away from you if the question is not phrased properly! ;)  Seriously Mike, I think you would have made a damn good lawyer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I totally agree with Zero's final statement.  It is certainly nice to know something about the background of the poster but it is not &quot;a requirement.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I personally chose to use my real name and share with the list members about my life so they would have a fuller understanding of me as a person.  I feel I have benefitted from this, but it is a very personal choice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I realize Mike Lorrey is pressing home his argument about a transparent society, but he needs to do it without attacking Zero as a person.  I am on a daily basis impressed by the quality of posts by both people and want them to continue their exchanges, but without becoming enemies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Zero wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry, you can call me a &quot;coward&quot; if you like, but I tell my kids all the time that it is stupid to give out personal information about yourself to people you don't know. I think that rule applies equally well to adults as to kids. I don't know you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A very good point that we all need to keep in mind.  Zero has not only himself but his family to be concerned about.  I believe Mike Lorrey is an honorable man, but there are many people on this list I do not know who might not be as trustworthy.  I have gotten to the point with several listmembers where I feel I do know them and can trust them, but that takes time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yet what is the point of lobbying for a transparent society if the
<BR>
proponent contradicts himself by telling his kids,&quot;it is stupid to give
<BR>
out personal information about yourself to people you don't know.&quot;??????
<BR>
That is pure and total hypocrisy. I understand the point about not
<BR>
attacking the person. The commonly accepted rules of debate mandate that
<BR>
the parties participating are a) honorable b) are open, c) are honest,
<BR>
and d) are straightforward. By his repeated demonstrations of hypocrisy,
<BR>
his double dealing and self contradictory statements, he has
<BR>
demonstrated to me that he is not a person who is entering the debate as
<BR>
an equal, honest, and open party, that he is not to be trusted.
<BR>
<P>As I said in another post, totalitarians (fascist, socialist, what have
<BR>
you) don't enter into debates like this as open and honest participants.
<BR>
They use the rules of debate to hide their true motivations and true
<BR>
goals. The worst crimes against humanity have occured in this century
<BR>
specifically because good, honest, open people like us assumed that
<BR>
people like that did not have ulterior motives, that they were honest in
<BR>
their arguments and in their stated goals. We need to recognise that
<BR>
such people can and are identifiable by the policies they espouse.
<BR>
Granted some good and honest, but hopelessly naive or good intentioned
<BR>
people can also honestly wind up with similar opinions. The only thing
<BR>
that weeds out the wheat from the chaff is their intransigence, their
<BR>
unwillingness to be confused by the facts.
<BR>
<P>One thing I've learned in my life is that when someone starts to act
<BR>
like a scoundrel, and I call them on it, one key phrase always indicates
<BR>
that something funny is going on. They always insist, almost verbatim
<BR>
(its odd how this is), that,&quot;I/we have no hidden agenda.&quot; That always
<BR>
occures right before you wind up taking it up the backside.
<BR>
<P>Scoundrels can and do chameleon themselves as 'reasonable' people,
<BR>
people that are trying to reach a 'reasonable accomodation'. They paint
<BR>
themselves as the most reasonable people in the room, and their
<BR>
opposition as a bunch of hopeless dreamers, or radical reactionaries. 
<BR>
<P>For these reasons, when I see someone acting like Zero has done, the
<BR>
hairs on the back of my head immediately get twitchy. Orwell had a good
<BR>
way of describing people like them. He called them 'crypto-fascists' and
<BR>
'crypto-communists', meaning that their true allegiance was hidden,
<BR>
possibly even to themselves, but they were such individuals in
<BR>
everything but name.
<BR>
<P>I've seen a sigline a person I know uses. It is: &quot;Its easier to fight
<BR>
for one's principles than live up to them.&quot; Its rather obvious that Mr.
<BR>
Powers is living in a similar quandary. He thinks that we all should
<BR>
open our lives up to the world so he can feel secure at night, but
<BR>
doesn't want to divulge similar information about himself, because he
<BR>
still beleives in the typical socialist precept that,&quot;people are no damn
<BR>
good.&quot; He may have legitimate concerns about personal security for his
<BR>
family, this is understood. What he fails to grasp is that everyone else
<BR>
in the world has a free and equal right to have such concerns for
<BR>
themselves about him and people like him, as well as about the rest of
<BR>
the human race, which is why a transparent society is the worst sort of
<BR>
tyranny over the most number of people.
<BR>
<P>I don't need to know everything about Mr. Powers to feel secure, partly
<BR>
because I know that people like him get the government to do their dirty
<BR>
work for them. I am a law abiding person, so I know that anyone breaking
<BR>
down my door is committing an illegal act, no matter who they work for.
<BR>
The fact that Mr. Powers wants to strip me of my rights on so many
<BR>
areas, but wants to use the government to do it is a rather blanket
<BR>
indication that my earlier statement about Mr. Powers' possible
<BR>
cowaradice is right on the money.
<BR>
<P>I suggest Mr. Powers lay off the Marx for a while and read up on Rand.
