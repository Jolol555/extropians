<EM>&gt; &gt;As previously stated by Lee, unless that film clearly shows YOU driving

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wrong.  Film showing your car running a red light raises what's called a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;rebuttable presumption&quot; that *you* committed the infraction.  The burden 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then shifts to you to rebut that presumption by admissible evidence.  If you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot meet that burden, you lose.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's how things work in the UK. Or worked ...
<BR>
<P>In one of those beautiful demonstrations that the legal system has a
<BR>
life of its own, speed/red light cams were effectively rendered useless
<BR>
in Scotland about six weeks ago.
<BR>
<P>(Note: Scotland has a separate, different legal system from England
<BR>
and Wales.)
<BR>
<P>Over the past year, the UK government has been following up its
<BR>
obligations under the Maastricht Treaty by writing the European
<BR>
Declaration of Human Rights into law as a bill of rights, overriding
<BR>
other legislation. (It's not quite as good as a separate constitution,
<BR>
but it's going in the right direction.) 
<BR>
<P>A case was heard of a woman who was found drunk and disorderly in a
<BR>
Scottish town centre. The cop who arrested her asked her how she'd
<BR>
gotten there, and she admitted to having driven into town. On appeal,
<BR>
her conviction for drunk-driving was quashed: the appeal court judge
<BR>
ruled that she'd been required to incriminate herself (admitting
<BR>
to drink-driving) because if she hadn't answered the question she'd
<BR>
have been nailed under a supplementary charge (I forget the precise
<BR>
details, but something arising from refusing to cooperate with a police
<BR>
investigation). As this violated her civil rights, her conviction was
<BR>
overturned.
<BR>
<P>An interesting corollary of this finding: when a speeding camera photo
<BR>
and ticket is issued to a car owner, they're required to either accept
<BR>
the charge and fine, or produce someone else who'll plead guilty to it.
<BR>
However, this requires them in effect to incriminate themself, which it
<BR>
now turns out is a violation of the bill of rights. 
<BR>
<P>So Scotland suddenly woke up one morning to find that speed cams weren't
<BR>
legal any more. (Like wheel clamps, which are horribly illegal here. 
<BR>
Back in the 1980's a judge ruled on a car owner who sued a business that
<BR>
clamped their car when it was parked in front of them. It turns out 
<BR>
that wheel clamping is &quot;demanding money with threats&quot;, otherwise known
<BR>
as blackmail, and good for eight to twelve years in pokey. Which is why
<BR>
if you go to Scotland on a driving holiday your car may be picked up
<BR>
and towed on order of a police officer, but it's safe from wheel clamps.)
