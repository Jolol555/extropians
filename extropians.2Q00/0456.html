<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  I don't read the IXth ammendment this way.  The text says:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;            The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;            shall not be construed to deny or disparage others 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;            retained by the people. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;  I'm no constitutional law scholar, but this just seems to say &quot;The fact 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;  a subject is addressed in the Constitution doesn't mean that it 
</EM><BR>
excludes 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;  other rights the people may have,&quot; or alternatively, &quot;the Constitution 
</EM><BR>
is 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;  not an exhaustive enumeration of rights.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Since I don't see what Greg disputes in Mike's interpretation, I'm willing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  go along with his paraphrasing.  Now, if like some jurisprudes, Greg 
</EM><BR>
intends 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to claim the 9th does not cover *individual* rights, I'll have a bone to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  pick.  Ditto if he thinks that the Founders did not have natural rights in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  mind; scholarship has quite firmly established that matter, in my opinion.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's a fine point and I think you're right that we don't disagree about the 
<BR>
ultimate effect, but as a matter of simple textual construction and logic, I 
<BR>
don't think you can look to the IXth amendment as a SOURCE of rights.  I 
<BR>
think the most we can say is 1) that it's not inconsistent with rights that 
<BR>
arise from or have their legal authority in some other source and 2) that 
<BR>
from this we can safely imply that the Founders believed that there were such 
<BR>
other sources of human rights.  The little education I have in constitutional 
<BR>
historical scholarship does bear out that the Founders shared an almost 
<BR>
universal belief in &quot;natural rights&quot;.  Their thinking about the source of 
<BR>
natural rights was somewhat diverse, though; some finding the basis for them 
<BR>
in religious ideas, others in a kind of fictitious anthropology derived from 
<BR>
Locke.  Thus the textual ambiguity regarding &quot;supra-constitutional rights&quot; 
<BR>
was good drafting on the part of the Founders, sincce it left that issue 
<BR>
open.  Ironically, the basis of a concept of &quot;natural rights&quot; that many 
<BR>
extropians would likely find compelling, the work of Adam Smith, was just 
<BR>
coming to the attention of the world at that time, and so wasn't a mature 
<BR>
intellectual system yet from which the Founders could have derived a more 
<BR>
rigorous secular theory of natural rights.
