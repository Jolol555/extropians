</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shorthand, I call my reading list, the &quot;brain clip&quot;, holding rounds of brain

<P>Oh, good then.  I know you are a good sport Greg, lucky for me... {8^D
<BR>
I dont wanna be preachy on that, since I myself own a shootin arn or
<BR>
two and enjoy a day of sport shooting.
<BR>
<P>I also think I want to partially recant what I said about Diamond's
<BR>
book.  It was a good book, thought provoking.  The reason I found
<BR>
it a little frustrating is hardly the fault of the author.  His focus
<BR>
is on explaining why one society ended up with more technology
<BR>
than others, and ended up going with a combination of factors
<BR>
which kinda end up with a notion Gould would like: contingency,
<BR>
or blind luck, based on location and fortunate interspecies synergy.
<BR>
<P>None of this really gets at the questions that have puzzled me for
<BR>
years.  Im  worse off than the Grinch was the time he trashed Whoville
<BR>
and they had a songfest anyway: he puzzled and puzzled till his
<BR>
puzzler was sore.  Why, for instance, did the process of evolution
<BR>
do so little with big brains?  We have only a few really large brained
<BR>
species: cetacians, elephants, humans.  Why?  And why did evolution
<BR>
wait until so late in the process to produce large brained species?
<BR>
And why did humans have large brains for nearly 100k yrs before
<BR>
inventing civilization?  And why did it take large brained humans
<BR>
so long to get written language?  This leads to the obvious question,
<BR>
how in the hell does technological stagnation occur?
<BR>
<P>All of these questions suggests there are evolutionary positive
<BR>
feedback loops at work, which are inherently destabilizing.
<BR>
Miller hits exactly those kinds of questions in The Mating Mind,
<BR>
not to explain why one culture is dominant, but rather why
<BR>
the human species is so dominant over so many other lifeforms.
<BR>
<P>This should shed a great deal of light on the observation of
<BR>
extropians and transhumanists: that the human species appears
<BR>
to be heading toward a singularity.  spike
