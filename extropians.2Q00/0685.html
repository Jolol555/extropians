<P>
I can't help forwarding the following, i.e. the memes made me do it
<BR>
(source unknown, sorry if it has been here). I especially like the
<BR>
question as to how you know that what you are not eating is actually
<BR>
tuna, and wonder how to program the subjective experience of not eating
<BR>
a specific choice from an arbitrarily large number of choices.

<P><P>The Jean-Paul Sartre Cookbook
<BR>
<P>We have been lucky to discover several previously lost diaries of French
<BR>
<P>philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre stuck in between the cushions of our office
<BR>
<P>sofa.  These diaries reveal a young Sartre obsessed not with the void,
<BR>
but with food. Aparently Sartre, before discovering philosophy, had
<BR>
hoped to
<BR>
write &quot;a cookbook that will put to rest all notions of flavor forever.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The diaries are excerpted here for your perusal.
<BR>
<P>October 3
<BR>
<P>Spoke with Camus today about my cookbook. Though he has never actually
<BR>
eaten, he gave me much encouragement.  I rushed home immediately to
<BR>
begin work.  How excited I am!  I have begun my formula for a Denver
<BR>
omelet.
<BR>
<P>October 4
<BR>
<P>Still working on the omelet. There have been stumbling blocks.  I keep
<BR>
creating omelets one after another, like soldiers marching into the sea,
<BR>
<P>but each one seems empty, hollow, like stone.  I want to create an
<BR>
omelet that expresses the meaninglessness of existence, and instead they
<BR>
taste
<BR>
like cheese.  I look at them on the plate, but they do not
<BR>
look back.  Tried eating them with the lights off.  It did not help.
<BR>
Malraux suggested paprika.
<BR>
<P>October 6
<BR>
<P>I have realized that the traditional omelet form (eggs and cheese) is
<BR>
bourgeois.  Today I tried making one out of cigarette, some coffee, and
<BR>
four tiny stones.  I fed it to Malraux, who puked.  I am encouraged, but
<BR>
<P>my journey is still long.
<BR>
<P>October 10
<BR>
<P>I find myself trying ever more radical interpretations of traditional
<BR>
dishes, in an effort to somehow express the void I feel so acutely.
<BR>
Today I tried this recipe:
<BR>
<P>Tuna Casserole
<BR>
<P>Ingredients: 1 large casserole dish
<BR>
Place the casserole dish in a cold oven.  Place a chair facing the oven
<BR>
and sit in it forever.  Think about how hungry you are.  When night
<BR>
falls,
<BR>
do not turn on the light.
<BR>
<P>While a void is expressed in this recipe, I am struck by its
<BR>
inapplicability to the bourgeois lifestyle.  How can the eater recognize
<BR>
<P>that the food denied him is a tuna casserole and not some other dish?  I
<BR>
<P>am becoming more and more frustrated.
<BR>
<P>October 25
<BR>
<P>I have been forced to abandon the project of producing an entire
<BR>
cookbook.  Rather, I now seek a single recipe which will, by itself,
<BR>
embody the
<BR>
plight of man in a world ruled by an unfeeling God, as well
<BR>
as providing the eater with at least one ingredient from each of the
<BR>
four basic food groups.  To this end, I purchased six hundred pounds of
<BR>
foodstuffs from the corner grocery and locked myself in the kitchen,
<BR>
refusing to admit anyone.  After several weeks of work, I produced a
<BR>
recipe calling for two eggs, half a cup of flour, four tons of beef, and
<BR>
a
<BR>
leek.  While this is a start, I am afraid I still have much work ahead.
<BR>
<P>November 15
<BR>
<P>Today I made a Black Forest cake out of five pounds of cherries and a
<BR>
live beaver, challenging the very definition of the word cake.  I was
<BR>
very
<BR>
pleased.  Malraux said he admired it greatly, but could not stay for
<BR>
dessert.  Still, I feel that this may be my most  profound achievement
<BR>
yet, and have resolved to enter it in the Betty Crocker Bake-Off.
<BR>
<P>November 30
<BR>
<P>Today was the day of the Bake-Off.  Alas, things did not go as I had
<BR>
hoped.   During the judging, the beaver became agitated and bit Betty
<BR>
Crocker
<BR>
on the wrist.  The beaver's powerful jaws are capable of felling blue
<BR>
spruce in less than ten minutes and proved, needless to say, more than a
<BR>
match
<BR>
for the tender limbs of America's favorite homemaker.  I only got third
<BR>
place.  Moreover, I am now the subject of a rather nasty lawsuit.
<BR>
<P>December 1
<BR>
<P>I have been gaining twenty-five pounds a week for two months, and I am
<BR>
now experiencing light tides.  It is stupid to be so fat.  My pain and
<BR>
ultimate solitude are still as authentic as they were when I was thin,
<BR>
but seem
<BR>
to impress girls far less.  From now on, I will live on cigarettes and
<BR>
black coffee.
<BR>
<P>Sorry, there is no exit from this page.
