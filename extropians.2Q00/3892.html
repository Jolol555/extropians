<EM>&gt; &gt; No time to comment on everything this morning, but the above point of
</EM><BR>
view
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; clearly means Lorrey means anything and everything can be redefined as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; military target.  In other words, any war is always total war and any
</EM><BR>
nation
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; engaging in war that thinks it has right on its side -- and what nation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; going to war claims it doesn't -- can bomb and kill indiscriminately.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, that is NOT what I mean. You cannot specifically target civilians,
</EM><BR>
private
<BR>
<EM>&gt; buildings that don't contribute to the war effort (and propaganda is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contribution to the war effort, so a TV station IS a legitimate target),
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree in regards to TV stations.  I think, in particular, the TV
<BR>
stations were bombed to prevent non-NATO media from operating.  (Not that
<BR>
Milosevic supported or defended free media.  In fact, during and after the
<BR>
bombing, he basically did everything in his power to stop all but
<BR>
pro-Milosevic media from functioning.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; hospitals, schools, prisons, etc. However, there is a difference between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; targeting a non-combatant, and accidentally killing a non-combatant
</EM><BR>
through
<BR>
<EM>&gt; collateral damage while in the course of attacking a legitimate target.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree about the difference between targeting and accidentally hitting
<BR>
someone or something.  Even so, there is a such thing as accidents and
<BR>
willful negligence in targeting.  For instance, if one bombs a target in a
<BR>
population center, I think any civilian deaths and destrcution of
<BR>
nonmilitary propert might be regarded as willful neglegence -- and not a
<BR>
mere accident.
<BR>
<P>See _The Globe and Mail_ article at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.globeandmail.com/gam/TopNational/20000522/UBOMBM.html">http://www.globeandmail.com/gam/TopNational/20000522/UBOMBM.html</A>
<BR>
<P>wherein Canadian commanders admit to probably hitting civilians despite
<BR>
extreme precautions.  (For the record, this does NOT look like the Yugoslav
<BR>
forces put their bases there because NATO air strikes were in the offing,
<BR>
but rather because they'd always been there.  The last time Yugoslavia was
<BR>
bombed was during WW2.)  I also wonder, given the description of the target
<BR>
selection process -- if indeed this was the process used by all NATO
<BR>
missions -- why was the Chinese embassy bombed, from three separate
<BR>
directions no less?
<BR>
<P>In this case -- bombing Yugoslavia -- the innocent shields of threats
<BR>
argument can't really be used.  Yugoslavia was not an aggressor by
<BR>
international standards.  The fact that it did not consent to the
<BR>
Rambouillet terms is not grounds for warfare, especially if one looks at the
<BR>
terms, which basically included provisions for NATO to occupy all of
<BR>
Yugoslavia.  Has Lorrey read the terms?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; civilian with brains will stay as far away from any military target as
</EM><BR>
possible.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Bridges are and always have been considered primary military targets.
</EM><BR>
<P>See below.  I don't necessarily disagree on bridges, though the argument
<BR>
about staying away from targets kinds of goes against Lorrey's argument
<BR>
later on about bombing Dresden.  Since Dresden was an arts Mecca, one would
<BR>
suspect that it would not be a primary or even secondary target.  (Again:
<BR>
the real reason for bombing Dresden had to do with satisfying the Soviets --
<BR>
not with helping the war effort.  That is, unless one considers do any of
<BR>
one's allies whims helping the war effort.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I recall the bombing of the train bridge.  The pilot saw the train after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dropping his first load and went back and bombed again.  The NATO
</EM><BR>
spokesman
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; claimed, &quot;He bombed in good faith.&quot;  What, pray tell, would bombing in
</EM><BR>
&quot;bad
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; faith&quot; be?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bombing in bad faith is specifically bombing a target that you are aware
</EM><BR>
has a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; large number of non-combatants in the target zone. This is called an
</EM><BR>
atrocity.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; If you drop a bomb, knowing the target is clear, and while the bomb is
</EM><BR>
dropping
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a non-combatant runs into the target area, that is not an atrocity, that
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; stupidity on the part of the non-combatant.
</EM><BR>
<P>Recall, in the case I mentioned, he bombed, the train entered the target
<BR>
area then he rebombed.  So, by Lorrey's standard, the first drop was &quot;good
<BR>
faith,&quot; the second &quot;bad faith.&quot;  (If he thinks the commuter train moved into
<BR>
the target area because its engineer saw the bridge being demolished, this
<BR>
is something he'll have to prove.  The specifics of the case _seem_ to be
<BR>
that the train was moving and its engineer unaware of the bombing.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The Soviets actually asked the British and Americans to target the city.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Tens of thousands were killed.  The military targets in Dresden were
</EM><BR>
road
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and rail centers.  In order to minimize civilian and refugee deaths, all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that would have been necessary was targeting these outside the city.
</EM><BR>
The
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bombing took place in February of 1945.  The war ended a few months
</EM><BR>
later.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This was not material to ending the war -- any more than turning over
</EM><BR>
people
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the Soviets after the war was material to keeping the peace.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; General 'Bomber' Harris was the British commander in charge of the British
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bombing raid, he heard the Americans were going to target a few military
</EM><BR>
targets
<BR>
<EM>&gt; around Dresden, and he was so competetive that he HAD to bomb Dresden
</EM><BR>
first, so
<BR>
<EM>&gt; he sent up the British mission. I do happen to think that Harris should
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; been tried for war crimes, as a matter of fact.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm glad to see that he thinks that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, are you saying the Germans were housing POWs in the city, as
</EM><BR>
human
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; shields? That, in itself, is a war crime.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The Germans, to my knowledge, did not know Dresden was going to be
</EM><BR>
bombed.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Up until February of 1945, to my knowledge, Dresden had never been
</EM><BR>
heavily
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bombed AND it was not a military center -- being mainly an &quot;arts&quot; Mecca.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They didn't know when any place was going to be bombed. That is not an
</EM><BR>
excuse.
<BR>
<P>But according to Lorrey's other material on this, he gives one the idea that
<BR>
civilians can expect to know where not to be not to get bombed.  I don't
<BR>
want to keep going back and forth on this.  Suffice to say, we disagree here
<BR>
and it does not appear agreement will be forthcoming, perhaps not until both
<BR>
of us cogitates on this for a bit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Note: We frequently bombed military industrial facilities where Jewish
</EM><BR>
slave
<BR>
<EM>&gt; laborers worked. Should we be blamed for their deaths?
</EM><BR>
<P>When one evaluates the effect of such bombing on the war, I think one could
<BR>
at best say it was a wasted effort.  It would have been much better to
<BR>
concentrate all bombing during the war on a) bombing specifically military
<BR>
targets (e.g., sub bases, barracks, tactical military targets such as tanks)
<BR>
and anything related to oil refining and storage.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; [big snip I'll to get to later...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; We don't kill the kids.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Who is this &quot;we&quot;?  Is Lorrey calling the shots down at the Pentagon?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are blaming America in general, and I am an American, so it is 'we'. I
</EM><BR>
note
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that you avoid replying to the rest of my comments here.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then let me restate.  I do NOT blame the US in general.  I blame its
<BR>
government at the time, specifically those in charge and those who carried
<BR>
out their missions without question.
<BR>
<P>Even if I did mean blaming the US as a whole -- which I did NOT -- then the
<BR>
response should never be to defend US as a whole.  (In fact, I've looked
<BR>
over my passed emails.  I've mostly used &quot;US government.&quot;  I've been pretty
<BR>
restrained on using &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Americans.&quot;  The context should have been
<BR>
apparent that when I did so I was not blaming every last American.  Also, I
<BR>
accept no guilt for the actions of others, so I hardly include myself in
<BR>
such collectivizations.)
<BR>
<P>Let me also state that I don't have time to comment on every single comment
<BR>
here.  If Lorrey would use his eyes to read, he would have noted that I
<BR>
stated in my last post on this thread with &quot;No time to comment on everything
<BR>
this morning...&quot;  Some of us have jobs and don't live for this list, okay?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; [another big snip I'll to get to later...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, I recall some 45 people were killed before the bombings began.
</EM><BR>
And, of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; course, the claims of the KLA Are to be beleived while any Serb sources
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; total liars.  Genocide on a scale to match...  Waco not Hitler.  I
</EM><BR>
suppose
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that justifies bombing all of Yugoslavia AND killing thousands of
</EM><BR>
civilians
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There were far more than 45 people killed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  I've made a mistake here.  The NY Times claimed in 1999 that
<BR>
approximately 2000 people were killed in all of 1998 in Kosovo.  Hardly
<BR>
genocide considering that that figure might actually be an overestimate and
<BR>
includes Kosovar Serb deaths.  I.e., it combines KLA killings as well as
<BR>
those caused by Yugoslav forces.  (The Serb page I cite below claims the
<BR>
death toll was 1200 and about 140 of those were Serbian.  Now, theyare
<BR>
probably biased, but 1200 is really not such a great underexaggeration of
<BR>
2000.  I mean, if one is going to lie, why not say 500 people were killed
<BR>
and 400 of them were Serbs?)
<BR>
<P>My mistake was in regards to an alleged massacre January 15, 1999 in the
<BR>
village of Racak in Kosmet which was reported widely before and during the
<BR>
bombings to be in the thousands and the actual number was in the dozens or
<BR>
maybe 15.  If my memory's correct, this &quot;massacre&quot; was a proximate trigger
<BR>
for the bombings.
<BR>
<P>(I should add too, we must be very careful here since the Pentagon controls
<BR>
media access in such campaigns.  Funny how little the Media and (Lorrey and
<BR>
too many Americans) has (have) complained about this control.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Where are you getting your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information? By the time we started bombing, there were hundreds of
</EM><BR>
thousands as
<BR>
<EM>&gt; refugees and thousands of people killed, raped, and being used as human
</EM><BR>
shields.
<BR>
<P>I've noticed Lorrey cites no sources.
<BR>
<P>Cato's testimony about the issue is at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.cato.org/testimony/ct-db031099.html">http://www.cato.org/testimony/ct-db031099.html</A>
<BR>
<P>It does not cite numbers of deaths in Kosovo, though it points out that
<BR>
before the bombing campaign they were way below Kurd deaths in Turkey.  (And
<BR>
I might add probably below the number of people killed by US ally Indonesia
<BR>
during East Timor's bloody exit from that nation.  In fact, Indonesia is
<BR>
still getting arms and money from the US despite its long and continuing
<BR>
tradition of using that money and those arms against its subjects.)
<BR>
<P>A probably totally biased source is <A HREF="http://www.suc.org/">http://www.suc.org/</A>  Even so, this does
<BR>
not mean it should not be looked at.  (One should critical with all sources,
<BR>
not just the ones one disagrees with, but it is only to be expected to be
<BR>
more skeptical about what one disagrees with than with what one holds near
<BR>
and dear.)
<BR>
<P>See the complaint about war crimes commited by NATO in Yugoslavia at:

<P>On the number of nonAlbanians fleeing Kosovo since NATO made it safe for the
<BR>
KLA, see &quot;UN: 210,000 non-Albanian refugees from Kosovo&quot; at:

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Also, the bombing against Yugoslavia seems to not have stopped the
</EM><BR>
killings
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the region, but escalated them.  Was this the goal?  I don't think
</EM><BR>
so.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; One should, after all, go to war with the notion to making things
</EM><BR>
better.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In other words, one fights because one thinks that the peace afterwards
</EM><BR>
will
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be better than the peace before the fight.  This should make war the
</EM><BR>
means
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to a higher end and actual military actions can then be measured against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whether they work toward this end or detract from it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the Serbs did not want what is happening to them now, they should not
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; given free reign to those who perpetrated the slaughter and rape of
</EM><BR>
thousands of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; ethnic albanians. What comes around goes around.
</EM><BR>
<P>Excellent analysis!  Of course, Lorrey seems to assume that no Albanians
<BR>
every did anything wrong here and that the Serbs as a whole deserve
<BR>
punishment.  In other words, if a Black man kills a White man up in Lorrey's
<BR>
neck of the woods, watch out!  He might just show up in Comptom or Harlem
<BR>
and kill a few Blacks.  After all, &quot;What comes around goes around.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Yugoslavia is interesting in another way.  The US had no vital interest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there.  It did not affect any US allies in a big way.  (If it did, why
</EM><BR>
has
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the trouble in the Balkans for the last ten years not bothered them?)
</EM><BR>
Also,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; US policy in the region has been markedly pro-Islamic and pro-German.
</EM><BR>
I'm
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not trying to bring a conspiracy angle in here, but it's strange to see
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; US standing by while Croatia cleansed itself of Serbs by the tens of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thousands, while not being able stand Serbia hold on to Kosovo and the
</EM><BR>
death
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; toll being orders of magnitude smaller.  (Croatia is a nation which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; celebrates its alliance to Nazi Germany and exterminated approximately a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; third of its population during WW2.  This does NOT mean I'm prepared to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; support a bombing campaign against Croatia TV and rail lines, civilians
</EM><BR>
or
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Croatia did not slaughter thousands of Serbs, they evicted them. They also
</EM><BR>
<P>Lorrey is not reading my words again.  He's talking  about the recent
<BR>
secession from Yugoslavia.  I'm not against secession per se, but Serb
<BR>
civilians were killed during this secession.  The total number of Serb
<BR>
refugees from Croatia during the 1990s is also quite high -- hundreds of
<BR>
thousands.
<BR>
<P>The killings I mention above -- forgetting Croatia's involvement in Bosnia
<BR>
for the moment, where Croatian forces were killing anyone nonCroation -- was
<BR>
as I said, &quot;during WW2.&quot;  About one third of Croatia's citizens were killed
<BR>
then by the Croatia government.  The killings were so bloody that it even
<BR>
made the Nazi and Italians queasy.  In the end, the Italians (surprisingly?)
<BR>
intervened.  See
<BR>
&quot;The Real Genocide in Yugoslavia: 'Independent' Croatia of 1941 Revisited&quot;

by Srdja Trifkovic at: <A HREF="http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/NewsST042100.htm">http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/NewsST042100.htm</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; received a good number of Croats that were evicted from other areas.
</EM><BR>
Tudjman
<BR>
<EM>&gt; wais not a saint, he was a thug as well. Most Americans, and I'm sure our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government as well, does not consider any of the leaders in the former
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yugoslavic states to be nice people. They are all thugs and bullies.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, that, for the most part, all the leaders in the region, including
<BR>
KLA leaders are thugs and bullies.  If Lorrey really believes this, then
<BR>
this is a great reason NOT to get involved -- as I've maintained all along.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;All we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do (and what the Europeans should have been doing but were to lazy and
</EM><BR>
self
<BR>
<EM>&gt; involved to pull their heads out of their asses) is try to keep the peace
</EM><BR>
in a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; very volatile situation, or else we might as will blockade the whole area
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; give them all the guns they want so they can shoot it out until they've
</EM><BR>
settled
<BR>
<EM>&gt; their differences. These are the only two real options.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so.  The truth is, the best thing to do, for the US and NATO would be to
<BR>
just leave it alone and allow those who want to emigrate leave the region.
<BR>
Truth be told, the peace has not been kept.  Kosovar Serbs are now being
<BR>
killed.  The KLA, with its dream of a Greater Albania, might destabilize the
<BR>
region even more, especially since it's laying claims to lands in Macedonia
<BR>
and Greece.
<BR>
<P>If NATO and the US had stayed out of it, chances are Yugoslavia would
<BR>
eventually disintegrated over the years as internal opposition mounted to
<BR>
Milosevic, but in the meantime the KLA would not be a loose canon rolling
<BR>
across the deck of the Balkan ship.
<BR>
<P>Again, I reiterate.  US involvement generally makes bad situations worse.
<BR>
Look at the outcome of Iran (helped to keep the Shah in power insuring that
<BR>
those yearning to be free from his tyranny would hate the US and the West),
<BR>
Libya (US CIA helped put Qadafy in power), Vietnam (overthrew elected
<BR>
government in the South and eventually helped to destabilize Cambodia, Laos
<BR>
as well as lose the war), Colombia (currently working on this one), Somalia,
<BR>
and so on.  This is not a track record of success with a few minor,
<BR>
excusable failures.  Instead it is a track record of major failures with a
<BR>
few minor, unexpected successes.  (I'll leave it to Lorrey to show the
<BR>
successes, if he can find any.)  If people would look at results rather than
<BR>
intentions, they might be very wary of any foreign involvement.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Once again, Europe is asking us to pull their nuts out of the fire, and if
</EM><BR>
we
<BR>
<EM>&gt; don't do it just the way they want us to, they try to blame us for the
</EM><BR>
whole
<BR>
<EM>&gt; thing. Sometimes I think we should tell them all to piss off.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think, for the most part, the US should remain out of it.  Europe has no
<BR>
current looming threats to its security.  Even a rampant KLA probably will
<BR>
only effect the Balkans and nowhere else.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; while in Chechnya, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Chechens started killing Russians first. While Serbia is small enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that we can do something about it, there is little we can do about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Russia except diplomatic protests.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My point was that Russia could make the same claims about Chechnya that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Lorrey could make about Yugoslavia.  In fact, the Russian policy with
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Near Abroad and breakaway republics like Chechnya and Ingushtia has been
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; claim that ethnic Russians are being persecuted -- a claim not
</EM><BR>
completely
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; without merit -- and use this as a pretext for intervention.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course. And given the level to which fundamentalist Muslim terrorists
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; percolating and penetrating in the 'Stans' these days, I'd be very worried
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to take action too if I were in the Kremlin.
</EM><BR>
<P>This not only doesn't rebutt my claim above, Lorrey ignores what he said
<BR>
earlier.  First, he told us that &quot;Chechens started killing Russians first.&quot;
<BR>
Now he's telling us this is all based on justified paranoia.
<BR>
<P>Is there anyone else on this list aside from Lorrey who thinks that the most
<BR>
recent Russian campaign against Chechnya was anything more than a ploy to
<BR>
take the pressure off the Kremlin for the sad state of Russia's economy and
<BR>
the rife corruption there.  It's funny how the whole campaign was timed
<BR>
right when Yeltsin's inner circle was starting to collapse and that it
<BR>
catapulted Putin, the architect of the campaign, into the Presidency.  It
<BR>
was nothing more than a massive and bloody PR campaign written with Chechan
<BR>
and Russian blood.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's a shame that the American people will have to pay for these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mistakes --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and not the politicians who make them.  But that's the nature of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; beast.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; How are we going to pay for them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Americans will pay through blood and treasure, of course.  With the
</EM><BR>
former,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there is terrorism and war which will claim American lives.  I'm not
</EM><BR>
saying
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this is a justification for this, but merely human nature.  The orphaned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Iraqi or Serbian kid who turns to terrorism is not going to think about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; morality the same way Lorrey (I hope!) and I do.  He or she is mostly
</EM><BR>
going
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to be motivated by revenge against the US.  That urge would not be there
</EM><BR>
if
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the US had either a) stayed the f*ck out it or b) been a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; restrained and civilized in flexing its muscles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Funny, until we started bombing, bleeding hearts like you were crying that
</EM><BR>
we
<BR>
<EM>&gt; were not doing enough to stop Milosevik. When are you ever going to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; satisfied?
</EM><BR>
<P>Lorrey is definitely wrong here.  I have been against US involvement in
<BR>
almost all foreign wars for the past decade or so.  I've especially been
<BR>
against US involvement in the Balkans.  I've never called for any
<BR>
involvement.  In fact, the Objectivist position on this, which I adhere to,
<BR>
is that no side in the conflict will provide a government which protects
<BR>
individual rights, so there is little point in supporting any of them.
<BR>
Also, since none of them, as yet, has made attacks on the US, there is no
<BR>
proximate justification for involvement.  (For the record, I don't think any
<BR>
leader in the region will ten years from now be landing troops in Vermont.:)
<BR>
<P>In fact, I'm generally against intervention.  I've been pretty much an
<BR>
isolationist since I've been old enough to vote.  (Of course, being
<BR>
sympathetic to libertarian anarchism, I've generally been against
<BR>
governemnt.  Sans government, it would be very hard to intervene.  Surely,
<BR>
people like Lorrey could join the foreign legion or send money to the KLA,
<BR>
but that would leave the 99 and 44/100ths of everyone else out of it.:)
<BR>
<P>What I wonder is whether Lorrey will be a big enough man to apologize for
<BR>
his mistake here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The treasure part includes property lost to terrorism and war as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; taxes paid to fund the current policy of military adventurism of the US.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But also, the price will be paid in many other ways -- a less stable
</EM><BR>
world,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As long as there are people who hate their neighbors just because they go
</EM><BR>
to a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; different church or have a different accent, and are willing to kill them
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; these differences, then the world will be less stable. Its did not start
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; us, and cannot be blamed on us.
</EM><BR>
<P>The thing to do is not to add wood to the fire.  Add wood to the fire and
<BR>
then one must accept some blame for the mess.
<BR>
<P>Enough for now!
