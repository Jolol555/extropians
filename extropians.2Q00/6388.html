<EM> &gt; &gt;  Diamond's book -- it's gotten strong pro and con reviews from
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt; people I respect, which means I ought to read it, I suppose.  Put another
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt; round in the clip!

</EM><BR>
<P>Add me to the mildly con side.  Much better is The Mating Mind, by
<BR>
Geoffrey Miller, which covers some of the same ground, but the
<BR>
speculation is more compelling.  This is the first work of his I have
<BR>
seen, but already the evolution material in there is more thought-
<BR>
provoking than the excellent (my opinion) work of Steven Jay Gould.
<BR>
<P>Miller affirms a notion I have had for some time regarding the two
<BR>
mechanisms for evolution: survival selection and sexual selection.
<BR>
Gould likes to insert a third mechanism for change: contingency
<BR>
(which is really dumb luck).  I have long suspected mechanisms
<BR>
are at work that allow human brains to evolve more quickly than
<BR>
those of similar mammals, a notion supported by Miller, and first
<BR>
introduced by Darwin himself.
<BR>
<P>Punchline: sexual selection as a mechanism for evolution creates
<BR>
a positive feedback loop, which predicts what electrical engineers
<BR>
would call a pole, but extropians might refer to as...
<BR>
the singularity.
<BR>
<P>I hope other extropians read this volume so we can discuss it.  spike
