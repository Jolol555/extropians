<EM>&gt; &gt; (I dislike the term &quot;capitalist&quot;--the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; term was coined by Karl Marx, who understood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nothing about human capital.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A bit extreme, what!
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, probably a *little* extreme, but not far off. I have actually read 
<BR>
his economics and studied Marxism thoroughly. Marx's sharp distinction 
<BR>
between workers and capitalists strongly suggests to me that he did not 
<BR>
appreciate the nature of human capital. Capital to him was material stuff 
<BR>
accumulated by a capitalist class. If he did have the notion of human 
<BR>
capital, how could he make such a radical distinction between worker and 
<BR>
capitalist?
<BR>
<P>I'm not saying that Marx was an idiot for this. It's reasonably 
<BR>
understandable at the time of his writings, during the late Industrial 
<BR>
Revolution, that he didn't appreciate human capital--knowledge, innovation, 
<BR>
coordination, exploration, etc. But, combined with his mistaken labor 
<BR>
theory of value, it produces disastrous errors in his economics. (His labor 
<BR>
theory of value also attributes all value to physical labor, ignoring the 
<BR>
role of knowledge, coordination and other forms of human capital.)
<BR>
<P>I go beyond merely seeing Marx as mistaken in his writing and actually 
<BR>
think he was probably intellectually dishonest, but it was clear at the 
<BR>
time of his writings that the wages of workers were, contrary to his 
<BR>
theory, going up. That was a natural result of slowing population growth 
<BR>
and increasingly competition for labor.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Marx boned a LOT of things, and I'm constantly amazed that there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are so many people who call themselves Marxists without any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;irony or qualification (neo-, quasi-, etc.).
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm surprised too, though I've found many many Marxists who *do* qualify 
<BR>
their views--Frankfurt School, Gramsci, Lukacs, Marxist-Leninists, 
<BR>
Trotskyites, etc. My experience may differ because I was surrounded by so 
<BR>
many Marxists of various stripes as an undergraduate.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, this came up simply because I noted that I prefer to use &quot;free 
<BR>
markets&quot; rather than &quot;capitalism&quot; since the latter term was coined by an 
<BR>
enemy of markets and may carry connotations of class divisions which are 
<BR>
increasingly irrelevant.
