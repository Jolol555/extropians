What do you think about (computer) networking the entire community?  If the
<BR>
proper provisions were made during the planning phases of residential
<BR>
construction, future implementation would be less complicated and more
<BR>
cost-effective, especially considering the potential returns.  Using this
<BR>
backbone, community members would not only have the perks of high speed
<BR>
Internet connection, (which is becoming an increasingly important
<BR>
consideration for prospective residents these days - for me, it was my
<BR>
PRIMARY concern when choosing an apartment :-) ) but one might also be able
<BR>
to use this as a basis for the implementation of a large-scale
<BR>
bio-statistics monitoring network, or something of that nature.  I'm not
<BR>
really certain how people would react to this latter idea, but I imagine it
<BR>
could be done. 
<BR>
<P>Two months ago we implemented a wireless communication link between two
<BR>
buildings, called a 'microwave ethernet bridge', after my employers acquired
<BR>
a nearby facility.   We also figured out how to bridge the central phone
<BR>
system over the air using 'addtrans' and 'branch extenders'.  The advances
<BR>
in this field have been truly remarkable.  The range capabilities are
<BR>
expanding all the time (up to several miles, I think, presently).  The
<BR>
combination of fiber-optic cable backbone, perhaps, and portable wireless
<BR>
solutions, could ensure a highly adaptable (in consideration of potential
<BR>
growth), stable, and relatively cost-effective, network foundation.
