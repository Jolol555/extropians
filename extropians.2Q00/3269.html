<P>Interesting!

| You'd need to be able to develop bio-safe implants.  Main problem:
<BR>
| infections around breached skin (as in, where the skin meets the plug or
<BR>
| the display screen).  Not a problem in rooms where surgery performed
<BR>
| (allows temporary breach to insert devices); major problem for
<BR>
| day-to-day use in public spaces.
<BR>
<P>I've been thinking in terms of physiological (genetic) modification to the
<BR>
nervous system, and possibly nanotechnology to create the physical
<BR>
interfaces on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis (I know - I'm not in a hurry).
<BR>
<P>Consider a dedicated neural &quot;processing&quot; center for i/o and decoding (becaue
<BR>
it's bidirectional communication) - similiar to speech centers?  Add a &quot;high
<BR>
capacity&quot; nerve which connects this center to an ending in, say, your left
<BR>
wrist.  When a physical interface is required to an external machine, the
<BR>
nano-entities create microscopic electronic passageways to the surface of
<BR>
the skin, which interact directly with hardware.  Advantages to this: 1) you
<BR>
might not need a &quot;standard&quot; physical interface to connect to (nanotech
<BR>
adaptability), 2) probably no infection worries, 3) the nanotech could
<BR>
probably insulate the body from any raw electricity or radiation.  Also,
<BR>
since I've got nano-entities in my world - they might as well repair any
<BR>
tissue damage that does occur.  :-)  Primary disadvantage: this all depends
<BR>
on currently nonexistent technology.

<P>| Both problems are already being worked on.  Perhaps a good first product
<BR>
| - tackling only the first issue, not the second - would be a hard drive
<BR>
| implanted in one's arm, with an I/O plug or minicomputer worn around it
<BR>
| and communicating via induction.  The plug/computer could get stolen,
<BR>
| but stealing the data would not be a pickpocket's work, as opposed to
<BR>
| (say) a laptop.
<BR>
<P>I like it!  You'd also have one foot in the door on more &quot;complex&quot; projects
<BR>
(see above).
<BR>
<P>| Remember, business plans are about *business*.  Funders don't care about
<BR>
| submissions of proposals to standards bodies - at least, not directly.
<BR>
<P>My logic on this:  The development of a standard contributes to acceptance
<BR>
and validation of your business model.  From a risk perspective: theory is
<BR>
cheaper than application.  From an economic and sociological perspective:
<BR>
society is going to require a period of adjustment to even the most trivial
<BR>
of &quot;AHCI&quot; applications - the standards process is a good start.  There are
<BR>
many people who would view even this conversation as immoral/dangerous.
<BR>
<P>| The most overriding question you'll have to address: how are you going
<BR>
| to make money off of this?  There are many ways you can do this, but you
<BR>
| have to look to find them.
<BR>
|
<BR>
<P>I suppose I would look forward to a decent salary for the next ten years,
<BR>
develop a working prototype in late 2009, go into production in 2010, retire
<BR>
in 2012.
<BR>
<P>Snickering softly,
<BR>
