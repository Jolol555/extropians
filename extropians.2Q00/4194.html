<P>
My Intelectual alarms go off as well belive me... those kind of glib canned 
<BR>
statements that I wrote are very dangerous to critical thinking, however 
<BR>
there is some value in not substituting the map for the terrain.
<BR>

<EM> &gt; nature.
</EM><BR>
<P>While my intellectual ego's danger sirens are sounding
<BR>
due to your observation, there's really no arguing
<BR>
with the truth of that statement.  [This will go
<BR>
somewhere - quickly]  Zen embraces dichotomy to brake
<BR>
down dualistic thinking.  That may sound like an
<BR>
obvious, shallow regurgirgitation of rhetoric.  But,
<BR>
it is really the key insight - in fact, the one that I
<BR>
grappled with.  To elucidate my take on this truth, I
<BR>
believe this is an expression of the universal truth
<BR>
that linguistic communication is, at best, a crude
<BR>
approximation of the internal dialogue/computation
<BR>
process.  [I feel myself getting sucked into the
<BR>
vortex again - but, I hear that siren song and can't
<BR>
resist].
<BR>
<P>&quot;You demonstrate a profound grasp of the obvious Dan!&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks.  But, whether we simply acknowledge the
<BR>
inadequacy in vague (perhaps, superior...) maxims such
<BR>
as the above or build an elaborate (and ridiculously
<BR>
convuluted) theory about the transfer and acquistion
<BR>
of meaning (e.g. Sapir-Whorf type theories of
<BR>
culturally/linguistically restricted meaning), the
<BR>
underlying, INFURIATING truth remains!  Everything
<BR>
that is said by a reasonably intelligent and
<BR>
thoughtful mind on this topic is, very likely,
<BR>
completely true...and, entirely devoid of functional
<BR>
application!
<BR>
Thus, people who are looking for a resolution to the
<BR>
ineffability of the highest levels of cognition
<BR>
(alternate conscious states, &quot;mystical&quot; insight, what
<BR>
have you) chase their mental tails around in a
<BR>
practically infinite web of semantic structure; always
<BR>
lured forward by the logic and truth of their
<BR>
pontification while deriving neither meaning nor
<BR>
satisfaction with their travels because the journey is
<BR>
endless.  It's not that is travelling to an infinite
<BR>
&quot;metaphysical destination&quot; but, neither is it simply
<BR>
circular.  New semantic structure is created by the
<BR>
analysis of the existing structure - it's novel!  It's
<BR>
useless!  Some people never give up that attempt -
<BR>
some philosophers, some of the sutra's authors (who
<BR>
knows if they're aware of its futility).  Others
<BR>
accept it in quiet resignation either out of wisdom
<BR>
(Boddhidharma, etc.) or a stillborn ontological
<BR>
curiosity...(virtually everyone!)  Who wins?
<BR>
<P>Screw it - I'm going to dinner!
<BR>
<P><P><EM> &gt; How about abandoning the habit of thinking in boxes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I'm a this.. I'm a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that.. Your a that, not a this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Great point - language creates false dichotomies and
<BR>
only roughly approximate relations...blah, blah, blah
<BR>
(just insert a paragraph from any of my other posts
<BR>
here - they're pretty much all the same completely
<BR>
true/useless/futile rhetoric!
<BR>
<P>CHEERS!  ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Just this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; compare it only to itself
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt; Thus, Zen becomes the ideal ethical/spiritual
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; system
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt;  (which, referring back to the earlier statement,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt;  the definition I choose for a &quot;religion&quot; : &quot;a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt;  coherent, stable/sustainable structure of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt;  ethical/spiritual principles with both
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; suggestive and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt;  predictive power.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Also Taosism. It precludes the inclusion of a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; western deity while still
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; known as a religion.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Fact is,  it can be practiced as either religion OR
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; philosophy, or neither.
