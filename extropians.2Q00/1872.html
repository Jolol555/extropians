<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; HTML was not made by a company.  It was first written by a scientist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; looking for a better way to share information, and freely given away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; There was no commercial incentive - at least, not until Netscape came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; along.  A number of other widely-supported computer standards - HTTP and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Linux, to name a couple of the more popular ones - similarly had no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; corporate backing before they became popular enough for companies to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; take notice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A government is a monopoly corporation, and that scientist worked for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government institution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Come on, now leave off who he was employed by. He wrote that standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to help create the Web as an common information-sharing medium.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Of course that picking nits, but the HTML standard created by CERN would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; never have gotten anywhere outside of CERN if some companies had not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; jumped on the bandwagon. Netscape has had tremendous influence on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; evolution of HTML
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's quite a space in the history before Netscape got on the scene.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The appearance of a commercial browser program was an important point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that didn't occur immediately. Mosaic... :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Was created by some of the guys who went off and started Netscape about
<BR>
a year after Mosaic was introduced. Netscape 1.0 was little different
<BR>
than Mosaic, but they both worked with HTML 1.0 as well, a different
<BR>
market from HTML 4.0
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; These other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; companies all decided to cry and whine when Microsoft came in and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; developed its own standards and its own variations on interpreting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; standard tags (just as ALL browsers do. none display the same page in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exactlyt he same way)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It went beyond things just being displayed differently a long time ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's quite possible for me to write a page according to the HTML 4.0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standard that Internet Explorer &amp; Navigator 4.0 claim to work to, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have it simply *not work* on one or even both of them. Instead, I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to find out the (undocumented!) ways each of these interpret HTML, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work out some way which caters for both.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know what you are talking about. With straight HTML, I make
<BR>
pages all the time that are little different. There are a few
<BR>
differences, for example, in how many pixels from the left and right
<BR>
margins of the window the edge of the actual page is set to when left or
<BR>
right justified. These are few and annoying for someone who is
<BR>
persnickety about their layout, but its not difficult to make complex
<BR>
pages that appear exactly the same in both browsers. Sloppy layout of
<BR>
the same page between browsers is more indicative of a lazy page creator
<BR>
than a real problem with the browsers themselves.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; microsft came out with ActiveX, and all of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Mac=heads who hated microsoft who worked in these new browser companies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (i.e. mostly students right out of school, where they used macs almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exclusively) automatically rejected the standard, rather than embracing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it, just because it came from microsoft.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's absolutely incorrect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ActiveX was rejected (by just about everyone, including people using MS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software) primarily because it's a HUGE security problem. 'ActiveX'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programs (there's nothing special about them, they're just Windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programs your machine downloads and runs) would load automatically and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run with full priveledges on your machine. They could trash your hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disk, read your files, send your data to someone. ActiveX was an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; absolute *disaster*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's only a secondary point It meant people producing content for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Web that was only viewable by people using Microsoft browsers on Intel-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based computers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wrong. So long as browsers on other OS's are made with runtime's to
<BR>
operate these programs, it really doesn't matter what OS is browsing it.
<BR>
I've done this with cobol programs. You can run acucobol programs on any
<BR>
machine you want so long as you have the runtimes installed. That is a
<BR>
failure of other browser manufacturers who refused to implement ActiveX
<BR>
runtimes in their browsers simply because it was a Microsoft creation.
<BR>
It is they who were being anti-competetive.
<BR>
<P>Additionally, there is no problem with making a runtime that disallows
<BR>
(or allows the user to disallow) certain types of system functions, just
<BR>
as Java does. So the only security hole is due to the release of an
<BR>
unready implementation. That is a typical Microsoft fault, premature
<BR>
releasing things. I'm sure that many of those suffering from Bill-envy
<BR>
will extend that failure to his personal life.
