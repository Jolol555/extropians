<P><P><P>Tiny Machine Uses DNA to Do Its Work
<BR>
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A tiny machine that can physically bend DNA to do its 
<BR>
work may be just the first member of a whole generation of microscopic 
<BR>
robots, Swiss researchers said on Friday.
<BR>
<P>They might be used to diagnose medical conditions, read genes or operate 
<BR>
microscopic valves for precise drug delivery, the team at IBM Research in 
<BR>
Zurich and the University of Basel in Switzerland said.
<BR>
<P>Writing in the journal Science, they said they found that DNA can be used to 
<BR>
bend tiny silicon ``fingers'' that have a thickness of less than one fiftieth 
<BR>
of a human hair.
<BR>
<P>They rigged up a system of these little cantilevers -- anchored at one end 
<BR>
and free to bend up and down at the other -- and glued single strands of DNA 
<BR>
onto the top.

<BR>
DNA naturally forms a double helix like a twisted ladder, and when cut apart 
<BR>
will naturally try to put itself back together again.
<BR>
<P>When the researchers put their cantilevers into a solution with the missing 
<BR>
halves of the DNA strands, the pairs zipped themselves together and the 
<BR>
little cantilevers bent under the force.
<BR>
<P>The movement could be used to see genetic variations in the DNA, such as a 
<BR>
mutation, but could also itself be harnessed to do work, the researchers said.
<BR>
<P>``This biomechanical technique has the potential to enable fast and cheap 
<BR>
biochemical analysis, and could be used for mobile applications,'' Christoph 
<BR>
Gerber of IBM Research, who led the study, said in a statement.
<BR>
<P>He said the same technology could look for active proteins being produced by 
<BR>
cells, including those the body produces during disease or after an injury 
<BR>
such as a heart attack.
<BR>
<P>James Gimzewski of IBM Research said the experiment showed that the unique 
<BR>
properties of DNA could be put to work in tiny robots.
<BR>
<P>``We have found a way to get DNA to do the work for us, so we don't need 
<BR>
batteries, motors, or the like to operate tiny machines,'' he said.
<BR>
<P>Such a little device might be used to open a valve, perhaps to deliver drugs 
<BR>
in precise doses right where they are needed in the body.
<BR>
<P>``For instance, we can envision a system to attack cancerous growth -- the 
<BR>
release of just the proper doses of chemicals in the appropriate location of 
<BR>
the body could be achieved using tiny microcapsules equipped with 
<BR>
nano-valves,'' Gimzewski said.
<BR>
<P>``They could be programmed chemically to open only when they get biochemical 
<BR>
signals from a targeted tumor type. This would enable the right therapy at 
<BR>
the right place at the right time, with minimized side effects and no 
<BR>
invasive surgery.''
