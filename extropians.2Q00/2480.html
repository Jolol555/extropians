<P>
Hey, Hey, Hey, Fat Robert, comes into the room and plops himself
<BR>
down on the couch between skinny Lee and skinny Nadia, forcing
<BR>
them into the corners with rather pinched looks on their faces,
<BR>
and says, &quot;You know, like man, I've got 40 messages currently in my
<BR>
&quot;Courtesy&quot; file, and while I'm a staunch supporter of freedom of
<BR>
communication, I have to comment on this --
<BR>
<P>Turning to Nadia, FR says, &quot;The world is full of insensitive dolts,
<BR>
who have communications protocols incompatible with your receptors,
<BR>
who should best be viewed through a pair of rose colored glasses
<BR>
because in the light of day their choice of fashion colors is
<BR>
downright unappealing.  They probably don't intend to dress that
<BR>
way or if they do, they may simply be insensitive to the feeling
<BR>
of fashion &quot;faux pas&quot; that induces in other individuals.  Consider
<BR>
that they are color-blind (e.g. handicapped) -- you can't fix the
<BR>
problem until a more advanced technology is available.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Turning 180 degrees towards Lee, FR says, &quot;Lee, the programmers
<BR>
world is one of black and white, you only get grey, if you allocate
<BR>
bits for it.  Every message you send is filtered and translated
<BR>
into the representational system of the recipient.  A workshop
<BR>
I took nearly 20 years ago pointed out -- 'Communication is a function
<BR>
of *intention*.'  If you are going to send a message you can't
<BR>
just throw bits over the fence, you have to format them in a form
<BR>
compatible with a protocol of the recipient(s).  Communication
<BR>
is not the responsibility of the recipient, it is the responsibility
<BR>
of the sender.  Failure to format appropriately means that you
<BR>
are doing nothing more than contributing to the heat death of
<BR>
the universe.  Hardly an extropian perspective.&quot;
<BR>
<P>FR gets up off the couch, and turns around, looking at both
<BR>
Lee and Nadia, and says, if you cannot learn to communicate
<BR>
effectively with a bandwidth of a few hundred symbols a minute,
<BR>
how on earth are you going to communicate when the bit rate is
<BR>
a million times greater?  You *must* learn to be aware of the
<BR>
protocols of communciation and work collectively to adopt the
<BR>
*most efficient* common ground.  Why?  Because your *life*
<BR>
depends on it.  If the Hansonian perspective of the singularity
<BR>
is correct, the only hope for most of us is to be able to
<BR>
focus on coming to a rapid consensus opinion and response.
<BR>
Some of high-risk-takers will get an early lead, and the only way
<BR>
to balance that will be the concerted effort of a much larger mass
<BR>
of egalitarian individuals.  If you get dragged down into a morass
<BR>
of he-said/she-said, I-thought/they-thought, you are **doomed**.
<BR>
<P>You can afford this debate in the current reality, in the future
<BR>
I would be much less assured.
<BR>
<P>Fat Robert, turns around, deanimates into a singular point,
<BR>
then disappears.  Lee and Nadia turn to each other (hopefully)
<BR>
with single eyebrows raised and hand over notepads defining
<BR>
communications protocols.
<BR>
<P>Robert

<EM>&gt; &gt;  SO let me get this straight...I'm supposed to feel sympathy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  and remorse for insulting people with the word &quot;stupid&quot;, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  innocent people dying and rotting in jail are OK?  Got it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lee, having *you* feel remorse was never on *my* agenda. I respect you and I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wanted to be sure you knew the effect your slurs had: towards shutting my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind to you like a steel trap. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It'd be like if you were standing on my toe. If you were not aware this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bothered me and I never asked to desist you might not move!! Plus, dude, it's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your choice what u *feel* about calling people stupid, but it's my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *responsibility* to try and stop you from doing it if it hurts our 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relationship; our dialogue.
