<EM>&gt; I read somewhere that someone did a survey of recent Harvard graduates, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only a small per cent of them could explain why there are seasons (summer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; winter, etc.) on Earth.  I can't really believe this is true.  Did anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else hear anything about such a survey?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, but I am not terribly surprised. I remember when I was in the 2nd or
<BR>
3rd grade, and the teachers started doing astronomy. I was big into
<BR>
astronomy at that age, and knew quite a lot. When the teachers got to
<BR>
explaining why there are seasons, they claimed it was because the earth
<BR>
moved closer and farther from the sun in its orbit, whereupon I stood up
<BR>
and told them they were wrong and proceeded to explain what really
<BR>
caused the seasons. I got told to shut up and I was sent to the
<BR>
principals office... and people wonder why I don't have much respect for
<BR>
teachers in america...
