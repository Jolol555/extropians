<P>
Over several weeks ago, someone on this list made
<BR>
comments to the effect that the &quot;Y2K Problem&quot; was a
<BR>
unique event never to be repeated. The reasoning was
<BR>
that, since storage space is now plentiful and
<BR>
databases routinely are able to store dates in formats
<BR>
that support the far, far, far future (I can't
<BR>
remember the details, but we were talking an
<BR>
&quot;astronomical&quot; number of years from now), there will
<BR>
never again be a calendar event that threatens to
<BR>
break a significant fraction of computer programs.
<BR>
<P>I believe an implication of the post I refer to was
<BR>
that there will be no &quot;Y10K&quot; problem, for example.
<BR>
<P>Since then, I have been sensitive to code which is an
<BR>
exception to this. That is, every time I see code that
<BR>
would fail in Y10K, I notice it.
<BR>
<P>And I have noticed code like this an awful lot. For
<BR>
example, in Web development, it is common to pass data
<BR>
to servers as parameters at the end of URL's. When
<BR>
passing dates in URL's, the habit I see is to use a
<BR>
four-digit year. When I suggest that a five-digit year
<BR>
be used (&quot;just for grins&quot;, I say), people just roll
<BR>
their eyes at me. (People do that a lot.)
<BR>
<P>Eight thousand years is a long time to fix these
<BR>
things, and it seems unlikely that there will even be
<BR>
URL's as we now know them in 9999 C.E., so I realize
<BR>
this is a mainly nitpicking, but it is NOT the case
<BR>
that just because we have plenty of storage space and
<BR>
super-duper date fields in databases, there will
<BR>
therefore be nothing like Y10K problem. (I say
<BR>
&quot;nothing like&quot; because I accept the probability that
<BR>
the &quot;Gregorian calendar&quot; will not be used for another
<BR>
8000 years.*) All it requires is &quot;shortsightedness&quot;,
<BR>
which probably will never go away entirely.
<BR>
<P>Also, isn't there some kind of limit on the internal
<BR>
Unix clock format? I remember hearing somewhere that
<BR>
it only goes to something like 2038. If so, that seems
<BR>
like a problem, although probably not a big one (I bet
<BR>
the OS could be upgraded without having to change
<BR>
application code).
<BR>
<P>-- M. Smith
<BR>
<P>* Once, after being forced to write code for the
<BR>
umpteenth time to determine the number of days in a
<BR>
given month, I ALMOST included a joke comment to the
<BR>
effect that all months should have 28 days (4 weeks
<BR>
exactly) to make programming easier, and TO HELL with
<BR>
the phases of the moon and the rotation of the Earth!
<BR>
So what if it meant your birthday would be in a
<BR>
different season every three years? Don't farmers have
<BR>
almanacs? Are there not more programmers now than
<BR>
farmers? Do not the needs of the many outweigh the
<BR>
needs of the few?
<BR>
<P>Actually, if there were 13 months of 28 days each,
<BR>
that makes 364 days a year. It would take almost a
<BR>
century for your birthday to change seasons. Isn't
<BR>
that close enough? And the 13th month could be named
<BR>
&quot;Smithember&quot;, because I thought of it! Yeah! And all
<BR>
you people who were born on the 29th, 30th, or 31st
<BR>
would just be out of luck, no birthdays for you...
<BR>
<P>See! You're rolling your eyes!
