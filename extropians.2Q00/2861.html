<P>
Friends,
<BR>
<P>I'm pissed.
<BR>
<P>Sasha was a brilliant and joyous spirit, and now he's lost to us.  Try as I
<BR>
may I can't do the warm and fuzzy &quot;my sympathies...&quot; thing.  It is a bad
<BR>
day for everyone.  It is a tragic, disastrous, and carelessly unnecessary
<BR>
loss.
<BR>
<P>I met Sasha only once, at the Foresight Senior Associates after-meeting
<BR>
party last fall.  I had seen his web page and marvelled at the quality and
<BR>
quantity of his work.  He was nothing short of a luminary among extropians.
<BR>
&nbsp;But we did not speak even one word about his rich contribution to the
<BR>
world of ideas.  Rather, we played table tennis.  More than several games
<BR>
worth, monopolizing the table, until finally, I felt compelled to let
<BR>
others waiting on the sidelines have a turn.  Christine Petersen had warned
<BR>
me about Sasha's wicked forehand.  But I'm no slouch, and though he nailed
<BR>
me several times, I held my own, perhaps I even impressed him.  I loved him
<BR>
immediately.  Now, there is only silence.
<BR>
<P>My cryonic arrangements are in place, so it doesn't apply to me, but I
<BR>
strongly urge that this catastrophe serve as a wake up call for all of us.
<BR>
Because this was bound to happen.  And it will happen again, unless...
<BR>
<P>I am an underachiever of striking proportions, but most of you all are not.
<BR>
&nbsp;I recommend that a fund be set up--I pledge $250/yr, the same as I pay for
<BR>
the insurance policy which funds my own suspension--and that whatever
<BR>
unique arrangements with the cryonics orgs be put in place, so that  when
<BR>
this happens the next time, extropian arrangements will provide whatever
<BR>
possibility remains to us for a favorable outcome.  We need $30K.
<BR>
Chickenfeed.
<BR>
<P>There is an un-extropian quality to this, a contradiction of the concept of
<BR>
personal responsibility, a communitarian rather than rugged individualist
<BR>
undertaking.  And it might even tend to encourage some to further
<BR>
procrastinate in making their own arrangements.  (Eliezer's immortal,
<BR>
right?)  On the other hand it might serve to provoke--shame them into it,
<BR>
if you will--the very personal-responsibilty-driven action which will make
<BR>
the entire business unnecessary.  But in the end, it is, to me, an act of
<BR>
deliberate self-interest:  for my sake, not theirs, I wish to insure that
<BR>
this sort of tragedy does not happen again.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps the cryonics option will turn out a failure--pessimists note: you
<BR>
won't soon hear this again from me as I am convinced that SUCCESS IS A NEAR
<BR>
CERTAINTY--but it is the only option currently available, but more to the
<BR>
point, consider how you would now feel if Sasha were safely tucked away,
<BR>
chilling out for a possible future reunion, rather than lost to us forever.
<BR>
<P>I still feel bad.
<BR>
<P>Damn.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sympathies to all,             Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;-unless you love someone-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-nothing else makes any sense-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.e. cummings
