<P><EM>&gt; |I understand that bacteria are biologically very different from the kinds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |of cells which make up our bodies.  We need to find something that can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |prevent them from reproducing without harming our cells, something so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |fundamental that they can't evolve away from it.  Hopefully, research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |will hit upon a &quot;magic bullet&quot; like this within the next few years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The fundamental biochemical processes of life appear everywhere.  Bacteria
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have this magical weapon: they take parts of DNA from other life forms and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incorporate into their own DNA programming. This could make it somewhat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard to eliminate them. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that is not really what usually happens. Bacteria often exchange
<BR>
plasmids, small loops of DNA containing &quot;recipes&quot; for various genes
<BR>
which may or may not be useful. Among the most important for us are of
<BR>
course plasmids coding for antibiotics resistance. As for stealing DNA
<BR>
from multicellular species, I think that is very rare. Viruses however
<BR>
sometimes do it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyways, we would only wish to get rid of _some_ of the bacteria.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Humans would find a world without bacteria a less than perfect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world, I am sure.
</EM><BR>
<P>There was some essay I read when I was young describing what would
<BR>
happen if all bacteria suddenly died. A quite depressing essay.
<BR>
<P>The trick is to control the bacteria that hurt us and our interests,
<BR>
or possibly change ourselves and our interests so that they become
<BR>
irrelevant. Getting rid of bacteria is overkill and far too hard.
