<EM>&gt; &gt; I once here cited analysis by Robert Shiller that suggested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the current stock market was in a bubble.  However, I just came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; across relevant analysis by J. Bradford Delong, who I have other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reasons for respecting.  He finds that long term fluctuations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are probably rational, while short term ones can be irrational.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I found a web page for Brad DeLong, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Brad_De_Long%27s_Website.html">http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Brad_De_Long%27s_Website.html</A>.  He's got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some fascinating essays there.  He writes a new article every week and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can subscribe to them.  Sounds like he'd be a great guy to have as

<EM>&gt; your econ prof.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Why Does the Stock Market Fluctuate?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Robert B. Barsky, J. Bradford De Long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Quarterly Journal of Economics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Vol. 108, No. 2. (May, 1993), pp. 291-311.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.jstor.org/fcgi-bin/jstor/listjournal.fcg/00335533/di976342/97p0105d">http://www.jstor.org/fcgi-bin/jstor/listjournal.fcg/00335533/di976342/97p0105d</A>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I couldn't access this, but I found a 1990 essay on his web site at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/pdf_files/Bull_and_Bear.pdf">http://econ161.berkeley.edu/pdf_files/Bull_and_Bear.pdf</A>.  This one made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much the same point, that stock prices are rational over the longer term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (10 years), assuming that investors extrapolate recent dividend rates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the future and determine prices based on expected dividend flows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He shows a graph (his figure 4) of actual stock prices over the last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; century, compared to what his model predicts, and they are in very close
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agreement visually.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However upon closer study, I noticed some things which made me more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; skeptical.  His model often lags the actual stock price movements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is especially noticeable in the 1929 crash.  The actual market peaked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in 1929.  But his predicted prices continue to climb and peak in 1931.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is easy to see why, given his model.  He predicts stock prices based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on recent years' dividends.  In 1929, dividends were still showing a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pattern of growth in recent years.  It wasn't until the early 30s that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; declines in dividends causes his predicted prices to fall.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But actually you can argue that the drop in dividends in 1930 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; onward was caused in part by the stock market crash.  Obviously all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these effects are interrelated and it is hard to single one out, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the crash surely played a contributory role in the economic slowdown.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As prices fell, people were wiped out, loans went bad, and there were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; widespread spending reductions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems, therefore, that the stock market crash led to dividend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reductions, which then caused his model to predict a stock market crash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But that's not a good prediction because the causative condition only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occured after the supposed effect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does his more recent paper extend this analysis?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, whenever I read these kinds of papers I want to see whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; analysis works when extrapolated forward.  DeLong had results up through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the late 1980s.  The last decade has been remarkable in its stock market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance.  Would his model successfully predict price movements in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 1990s?  My guess is that it would predict a strong bull market, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the continued economic expansion has presumably produced dividend growth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However I doubt that it would predict the degree of increase the market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has actually seen, with P/E ratios much higher than historical averages.

<P>I'm not an economist, nor do I know much about real-world economics, but as part of
<BR>
my studying international economics major with statistics whilst in college, I
<BR>
formulated a paper and the numbers (with ANOVA and ANCOVA or something) showing a
<BR>
direct correlation between government expenditures categorized as R+D and later
<BR>
growth.  So, basically, the forecaster of growth is research and development
<BR>
expenditure, although too much has the negative side effect of cutting other costs.
<BR>
<P>I can't say what this has to do with the stock market which is somewhat irrational,
<BR>
not to mention for many a rip-off, but it is my opinion that there is enough
<BR>
research and development not to mention productivity growth bootstrapped from
<BR>
computer and network productivity enhancements that make certain old-school
<BR>
predictors of growth conservative and perhaps even invalid.  In the new model,
<BR>
expected growth should be and is higher, and throttling it with interest rate hikes
<BR>
is negative in regards to what it is as non-inflationary growth.
<BR>
<P>I could be wrong.
<BR>
<P>I got the data from something like GAO reports.  I always thought this site was

interesting <A HREF="http://www.globalfindata.com/">http://www.globalfindata.com/</A>.
