<P>-----------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>This very large and detailed report from WHO covers 191 countries. Basically
<BR>
they are saying the obvious, namely, that if you live in poverty, have
<BR>
little access to health care, have little health education, possibly live in
<BR>
a polluted or dangerous environment, - then you are not going to live as
<BR>
long. The report can be downloaded as a series of .pdf files from
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.who.int/">http://www.who.int/</A> and then you can search for references to particular
<BR>
countries.
<BR>
<P>The report does not seem to have any particular political axe to grind. The
<BR>
statistics for the majority of the nations are far worse than for the USA.
<BR>
They are only pointing out that although the USA has the best medical care
<BR>
in the world, it comes at a price and not all USA citizens can afford it.
<BR>
The cost of aftercare and continuing treatment is also out of reach of most
<BR>
poor people. They attempt to analyse the statistics to give rankings by
<BR>
various different criteria. One of their gradings is for &quot;fairness&quot;. So
<BR>
while most  countries do not have as good health services as the USA, if
<BR>
more of their population have access to what they do have, then they are
<BR>
higher on the &quot;fairness&quot; table.
<BR>
<P>As I said originally, good medical treatment is available in many countries,
<BR>
so if you have the resources, you have a wide choice of where to live. And
<BR>
you can always fly into the USA if a very advanced operation becomes
<BR>
necessary and it is beyond the skills available in your chosen country. (As
<BR>
many foreign political leaders and rich people already do).
<BR>
