<EM>&gt; -HELLO!!! The reason I didn't &quot;bother&quot; to read the ballot is because I'm yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 18, and never had any reason to vote till now when I turn 18 this week. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never ceases to amazes me how people make unfounded assumptions about others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; online.

<P>Nice try, Alexander, but unless the schools have seriously declined since I was
<BR>
your age, you've probably had plenty of discussion and class time about the
<BR>
electoral process, along with mock elections in class, etc.  Now, you didn't
<BR>
communicate to anyone here that you were not of voting age, which IMHO does not
<BR>
excuse you from learning all you can about as many candidates as possible. If
<BR>
you expected to be a voter as of this week and hadn't done any research in
<BR>
advance, you think you should be a voter? Thats like expeciting to just go out
<BR>
and drive without taking driver ed.
<BR>
I knew who the candidates were from age 12 onwards, of course the school system
<BR>
did exclude most all talk of the libertarians, which would be expected for those
<BR>
with a vested interest in keeping public education going. My english teacher in
<BR>
HS was also the local NEA, NOW, and vice chair of the Lebanon Democrats. She ran
<BR>
the journalism class too, and really hated my politics. She couldn't fault my
<BR>
performance though, as finance editor, I was the first student in 10 years to
<BR>
turn a profit on the school paper...
<BR>
The lesson is, don't make excuses, cause everybody has one...
