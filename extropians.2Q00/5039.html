<P>Hey cool!  Where can I get one?  {8^D

<P>You know, I can imagine hysterical disinformation becoming a
<BR>
real problem for the first wearable computer users.  Someone
<BR>
will start a goofy rumor, such as someone could run a gag headline
<BR>
that says wearable computers can create a digital image of a naked
<BR>
person, which is then superimposed on the heads of existing
<BR>
persons, so that the user gets the impression she is in a roomful
<BR>
of naked people.
<BR>
<P>This would be the killer app that would sell em by the millions
<BR>
of course, but it could cause problems in the mean time.  spike
