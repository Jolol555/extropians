John Grigg,
<BR>
You wrote: enjoyed the three goals given for every extropian.  I would add 
<BR>
one more.
<BR>
4.  Sharing extropian memes with others in a positive way.
<BR>
<P>and later added:I wish we did have one or several wealthy patrons here who 
<BR>
could help move things forward in areas like Eliezer's singularity project.  
<BR>
Perhaps, some of the very people on this list will in time achieve great 
<BR>
financial success.
<BR>
<P>John, first thank you for the compliment I didn't copy.  If you accept the 
<BR>
eminent appearance of techniques of major live extension, and assume that we 
<BR>
are dealing with the cognitive elite of the Bell Curve then wealth is simply 
<BR>
a matter of learning how and having the time to accomplish the goal.  If we 
<BR>
have wealth and time then all the other goals fall into place eventually (in 
<BR>
twenty or thirty years) or at least for the most part.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sense of our situation is that most of our goals are going forward and 
<BR>
we really don't need a rich patron to get where we want to go.
<BR>
<P>Ron Harrison.
