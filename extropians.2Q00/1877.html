<EM>&gt; On 4/29/00 1:33:34 PM PDT, I asked the trillion dollar question:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Should we create a long term goal the neutering of all rapidly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  replicating biomass species, especially bacteria, and modify
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  them so they cannot support rapidly mutating viruses, so as to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  reduce our long term risks of extinction?
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; I don't think that would be a reasonable option. The amount of work is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least as staggering as the ongoing &quot;green goo&quot; experiment is.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well the &quot;green goo&quot; doesn't view it as work, it views it as &quot;survival&quot;...
<BR>
Also, I think you are significantly overestimating what it would take
<BR>
to recreate a few dozen bacteria in various environmental niches to 
<BR>
accomplish the chemistry required in those niches.  The &quot;work&quot; is
<BR>
in the evolution of the tools (enzymes).  Once we have those catalogued
<BR>
and understand the function, cutting &amp; pasting them into new genomes
<BR>
is not terribly difficult.  There is already one biotech firm that
<BR>
claims to be able to do &quot;switches-by-design&quot; (i.e. the human design
<BR>
of the molecules that turn on/off genes in genomes).  There are others
<BR>
that have been doing design of catalytic enzymes &amp; ribozymes for
<BR>
several years as well.  So even now we seem to have the knowledge
<BR>
required to synthesize new functions as necessary.
<BR>
<P>Part of the threat of the system is its complexity.  Every time an
<BR>
organism mutates so as to occupy a niche, it may create several more
<BR>
niches between itself and its former competitors that may be occupied
<BR>
by future organisms.  As Susan Powters(sp?) says at some point we have
<BR>
to &quot;Stop the Madness&quot;, because the ever increasing complexity is what
<BR>
may guarantee that something will figure out how to eat us for lunch.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A much more realistic option would be basic hygenic measures,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; essentially each person ultrafiltering everything they contact.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not a bad approach.  Ideally you would want to retrofit it so its
<BR>
a permanent add-on.  I have my doubts as to whether that could be
<BR>
done with biotech.  It might require hard nanotech.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Further, the kinds of techniques that could obliterate environmental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organisms are necessarily related to the techniques that could obliterate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us, and I'd very much rather such techniques weren't used on a wide scale.
</EM><BR>
<P>But we already have methods to obliterate us.  The Russians, for example
<BR>
have recently asked for a treaty allowed delay in disposing of something
<BR>
like 40,000 tons worth.  You actually may not need to develop machines
<BR>
that have to run around killing other organisms, you simply have to
<BR>
retrofit the genomes so they are slightly more efficient, then they
<BR>
will outcompete the existing organisms.  You could also program them
<BR>
with suicide switches in case they (by some much less than likely to
<BR>
occur with current organisms chance) became pathogenic.
