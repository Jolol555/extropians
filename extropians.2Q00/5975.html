<P>
There's been discussion about the space treaty and how it applies to land 
<BR>
ownership - who cares?
<BR>
Land ownership is a social construction. I own land if a certain amount of 
<BR>
people around me believe that I own it, meaning that they will not walk on 
<BR>
it without permission or try to build on it, and that to get these rights, 
<BR>
they recognize that they need to obtain them from me, and that I may decline 
<BR>
any contract to do so.
<BR>
So, hopefully the first people to set up permanent living stations on Mars 
<BR>
and the Moon will realize this, and will begin to construct their own 
<BR>
conventions. When I go to the moon, I intend to make arrangements regarding 
<BR>
land ownership with other individuals who accompany me on the trip. My 
<BR>
suggestion will be that each of us is allowed by our contract to claim up to 
<BR>
10 square miles of lunar land per year (arbitrary number). If any individual 
<BR>
signing the contract makes a claim of that amount, the others will admit 
<BR>
that he &quot;owns&quot; this land in every sense of the word. Any new signer of the 
<BR>
contract will admit that he respects the claims of all previous and future 
<BR>
signers. Any dispute is resolved by a committee elected by all signers of 
<BR>
this contract, which ultimately can remove an individual from the contract 
<BR>
(thus nullifying his land claims), but will avoid this except as a last 
<BR>
resort. Signers also agree that they will defend the land rights of each 
<BR>
other signer as viligantly as they would their own.
<BR>
I just realized the proper term is signatory, not signer, but you get the 
<BR>
idea.
<BR>
There would be some other caveats too. I'd like to include something where 
<BR>
you have to actually physically stand on a peice of land in order to make 
<BR>
the claim. This will encourage immigration, and discourage people from 
<BR>
claiming ET land from Earth. Once you claim it however, you may sell it to 
<BR>
someone on Earth. There might also be a clause about maintaining a fence of 
<BR>
some sort around the property, or some kind of structure. And there should 
<BR>
be a buffer zone, maybe 30 feet wide, of land surrounding each claim which 
<BR>
may never be claimed by anyone and remains public (to ensure access to all 
<BR>
land plots).
<BR>
It would probably just be a few people at first who went to the planetary 
<BR>
body. Hopefully they would realize the utility of such a contract and adopt 
<BR>
it. As more people arrived, a percentage (hopefully large) of each 
<BR>
immigration would also sign. After a point, it's an established social 
<BR>
convention, and if you want to set aside some area and build something on it 
<BR>
or mine it, and be sure that people will not take it from you, then you 
<BR>
should sign.
<BR>
People who would want to enforce the space treaty's claims against land 
<BR>
ownership, if that is how the treaty is to be interpreted, why would they be 
<BR>
there in the first place? Why would they have any motivation to go up there?
