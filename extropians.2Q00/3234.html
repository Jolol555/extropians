<EM>&gt; | Personally, I'd love to affect genetic optimization of my offspring.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | think we need to be aware of the issues that arise: For example, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'haves'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | will have 'better' offspring, while the 'have-nots' won't be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; afford
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | all the 'kinder-mods'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Excellent point - I don't have a good answer, just a comparison or two:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Private School vs. Public School, Private Healthcare vs. Public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Healthcare...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Most people can't afford private education because they still get taxed
<BR>
to pay for other people's public education. Fact is that private
<BR>
education is actually cheaper than public education, and produces better
<BR>
quality product. Areas where this isn't so, or where private schools are
<BR>
kept affordable due to generous scholarship aid/income based financial
<BR>
aid or large amounts of parental volunteerism, show that poor people
<BR>
send their kids to private schools almost as frequently as rich people.
<BR>
Those that don't are typically those that are poor to begin with because
<BR>
they don't respect the value of education, and short change their kids
<BR>
as much as they've done it to themselves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; | And what happens if and when everybody can afford
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | it?  Are we all going to optimize our offspring's genetic predispositions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | towards some arbitrarily-chosen 'superior quality set'?  There goes the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | genetic diversity of the human race. It would be sad if humans turned out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | have a gene pool like the poor cheetahs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another excellent point.  Dan Adams' thoughts re: Dynamic DNA/genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programming (below) might help us address this concern - you allow for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; natural genetic variance, while boosting the likelihood of &quot;positive&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mutations (Dan, apologies if I'm butchering your concept).  This, of course,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't make a lot of sense when shooting for a particular adaptation (i.e.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brain/microprocessor interface), but...
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's my thoughts on making it affordable, the intent is really to
<BR>
eliminate the supposed have/have-not 'problem': Give tax breaks to those
<BR>
with above average or excellent genomes to donate their ova and sperm,
<BR>
and absolve them of all financial responsibility for the children that
<BR>
result from such donations. At the same time, give tax incentives as
<BR>
lump sum payments to women who give birth to such individuals reflecting
<BR>
the potential reduced costs to society by them not giving birth to
<BR>
psychopaths/sociopaths/mental/physical defectives. Its a free market
<BR>
solution to the have/have-not problem, it also won't encourage racist
<BR>
eugenics as well. Of course, those rated poorly will resent it and try
<BR>
to claim some sort of racism, but so long as there is no actual
<BR>
specification for racial characteristics, then there is in fact no
<BR>
eugenics going on, right? I admit there is a lot of room for abuse and
<BR>
scary government manipulation of the system, but I don't see an
<BR>
alternative other than allowing people to do it completely themselves,
<BR>
or ban it altogether. Personally I am for letting people decide for
<BR>
themselves and buy it themselves as individuals, but that is just me.
