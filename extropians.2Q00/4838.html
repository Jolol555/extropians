Just to zip up this thread, Kardashev, for all his 1962 faults, said was that 
<BR>
a type 1 Civilization used ALL the energy available on an entire planet, a 
<BR>
Two--their Solar System, a Type Three-a large galaxy (no globular clusters 
<BR>
need apply) and that is that.  He was probably off-base when he thought we 
<BR>
would use of need every little joule of energy on this globe. Lets just say 
<BR>
it would screw with the ecosystems on a Soviet level scale. As far as messing 
<BR>
with the solar system, I will leave that to the experts, but as far as 
<BR>
leaving too much dust to clock the sun, or otherwise dropping their megaton 
<BR>
level trash drifting to planet earth, they are free to do as they like, 
<BR>
unless we hear complaining from amateur astronomer who are content to view 
<BR>
Jupiter from 400 million miles rather then 20,000.  Galaxy level 
<BR>
intelligence? Hmmm -as Broderick indicates, hard to imagine. By the way Larry 
<BR>
Niven came out with a very short story in Analog July/Aug as a supplement to 
<BR>
Draco Tavern stories. Quite Tasty, though I am not sure his Chirpsithra 
<BR>
creatures would be content to remain Chirps.

<P>&lt;&lt; Could well be. I suppose it depends on whether the post-Spike future is
<BR>
&nbsp;*literally unimaginably strange* (perhaps with `magic physics', etc), or
<BR>
&nbsp;just *strictly unpredictable in detail* but functioning within today's
<BR>
&nbsp;rules, more or less (given a better fusion of QT and relativity, say). 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I do have a hunch that even more advanced science isn't going to show us
<BR>
&nbsp;that the Earth is actually a gigantic tetrahedron. Will it teach us rules
<BR>
&nbsp;of game theory and economics that *altogether* escape the strictures known
<BR>
&nbsp;to us? Maybe, in which case you're probably right. But if so, the
<BR>
&nbsp;post-Spike ET cultures are likely to be beyond our cognitive event horizon,
<BR>
&nbsp;aren't they? So even if they're *there*, you can't get there from here -
<BR>
&nbsp;*except* via a Spike of your own... Does this disable the Great Filter
<BR>
&nbsp;model? Dunno. Over to Robin... :)
