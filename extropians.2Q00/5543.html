<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem arises with assumption of the One True Religion which

<EM>&gt; &gt; I've seen Atheism practiced with the same intolerant zeal as Christianity or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Scientology.  But the Atheists aren't trying to save souls or to clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; engrams.  What, then, would their motive be?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Um, to keep the stores open on Sunday so I can shop?
</EM><BR>
<P>So the bars don't have to close so early on Saturday night?
