<P>
<EM>&gt; Yikes! If you think it's contrary to my religious or culture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; views, you were reading with extraordinary sloppiness. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explicitly mentioned the irrational adduction of medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since I'm the one here most vocal about circumcision, I would
<BR>
appreciate it if you could (1) tell me what you mean here by
<BR>
&quot;adduction&quot;--the context here doesn't seem to support what that
<BR>
word really means.  I assume you mean something like willfully
<BR>
ignoring or selectively emphasizing; and (2) repeat here on the
<BR>
Extropian list (I don't read &gt;H) exactly what you say you have
<BR>
&quot;explicitly mentioned&quot; before.
<BR>
<P>For the archives, my personal reasons for my crusade against
<BR>
circumcision are very simple: from study of literature and
<BR>
personal experience, I believe I would have a more satisfying
<BR>
sex life if that part of me most involved therewith were still
<BR>
intact (there are some who would argue that the brain is more
<BR>
involved in one's sex life--I leave judgment as to whether
<BR>
that part of me should be considered &quot;intact&quot; as an exercise
<BR>
for the reader).  Similarly, from a purely moral standpoint, I
<BR>
think all males ought to have a chance to make that decision
<BR>
for themselves rather than being clipped without their consent
<BR>
as I was (and as were most men of my generation).  It does not
<BR>
matter to me in the least that the practice is part of Jewish
<BR>
tradition; it is wrong in itself, not because of any cultural
<BR>
or religious associations.  Finally, even though I would
<BR>
oppose the procedure on these moral grounds even if there
<BR>
were some medical evidence favoring the procedure, I also
<BR>
honestly believe the preponderance of medical evidence does
<BR>
not support it.
