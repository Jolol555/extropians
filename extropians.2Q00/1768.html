<P>Sure, but flimdoodle manufacturing skills have nothing to do with widget manufacturing skills.
<BR>
Every person needs to go through a 2-4 year training program in order to re-utilize these
<BR>
people in the widget industry. Meanwhile demand for widgets is way up and supply can't meet
<BR>
the demand. College student Ernest J. Crumpwad invents the superwidget that can be made in
<BR>
half the time of a standard widget, and now all those people retraining to make widgets not
<BR>
only can't find a job, they are $40,000 further in debt with more useless skills.
