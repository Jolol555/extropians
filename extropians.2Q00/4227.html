<P><EM>&gt; It's more a matter of getting rid of government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bodies, such as the US FDA, which currently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control drug approval.
</EM><BR>
<P>While I think the FDA is a mess, and needs to be overhauled
<BR>
radically, if not replaced, I see no evidence that it should be
<BR>
eliminated entirely (with no replacement).
<BR>
<P>Here's an old Sci.life-extension post of mine that spells this
<BR>
out a bit more. Pardon self-quoting. (My views on what's
<BR>
desirable include marginally libertarian elements as well, which
<BR>
are not represented below.)
<BR>
<P>(I bring this up for many reasons. One is to stress again the
<BR>
complicated nature, for U.S. Extropian voters, of the choice
<BR>
between Bush and Gore.)

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Don't want to get off topic, but libertarianism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is relevant to life extension and to the issues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussed in this group for obvious reasons: If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the FDA regulators had their way, most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supplements that we take would have been banned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or severely restricted a long time ago.
</EM><BR>
<P>What &quot;we&quot;? Supplements have either no effect, or a marginal
<BR>
effect on longevity. Life-extension includes more than
<BR>
anti-aging efforts, true, and if that's all you mean, then sure.
<BR>
<P>But here's one recipe/scenario for delaying the development of
<BR>
dramatically effective longevity-enhancing regimens:
<BR>
<P>1) Make false or exaggerated claims in ads about the efficacy of
<BR>
life-extension supplements.
<BR>
2) Paint government regulation, toto genere, as bad.
<BR>
3) Since many people will now think A) the threat of limited
<BR>
access to supplements will appreciably shorten their lives, and
<BR>
B) the FDA are wrongly attempting to limit access to
<BR>
supplements, the supplement industry can now count on the public
<BR>
to do much of their work for them (by, for example, mouthing
<BR>
unthinking libertarian platitudes such as: &quot;the FDA has murdered
<BR>
millions&quot;).
<BR>
4) This, of course, makes the FDA more defensive, and thus more
<BR>
liable to be even more stupid than it's already capable of
<BR>
being, which makes step #2 easier.
<BR>
5) (cycle)
<BR>
6) People put less money and energy into creative enterprises
<BR>
such as Thomas Mahoney's venture [1], Geron, etc. -- investments
<BR>
which are far more likely to give us more life than the purchase
<BR>
of supplements will.
<BR>
<P><P>If libertarians focussed on reversing bans on fetal cell
<BR>
research, stem cell research, etc. (which bans are, fortunately,
<BR>
not yet absolute in the U.S.), and the funding thereof, then
<BR>
they'd be a positive force for life-extension. And some
<BR>
libertarians do, of course, have such a focus. Those
<BR>
libertarians who, on the other hand, simply seek to increase the
<BR>
consumer base for largely worthless pills are a pernicious
<BR>
force, since they help supplement-pushers perpetuate the myth
<BR>
that supplements have a significant effect on longevity, which
<BR>
distracts us from the real work needed to be done to retard
<BR>
aging.
<BR>
<P>If people could be brought into a full awareness that these
<BR>
pills are going to do either nothing (or next to nothing) to
<BR>
prevent them from being dead dead dead in a disturbingly
<BR>
diminutive number of decades, then these many millions (I think
<BR>
it's actually billions, now) of dollars could be better directed
<BR>
-- for example, towards BASIC SCIENCE from which will come the
<BR>
tools to stop aging entirely (and then reverse it).
<BR>
<P><P>In sum:
<BR>
<P>Supplements: The Fatal Distraction.
<BR>
Supplement Pushers: The Malicious, Selfish Distracters.
<BR>
Supplement Sellers: The Unwitting Distracters.
<BR>
Libertarian Political Philosophy: The Grease in The Distraction
<BR>
Machine.
<BR>
Supplement Consumers: The (Distractedly) Dead Or Dying.
<BR>
(FDA: The bumblers who make libertarianism's grease easier to
<BR>
apply.)
<BR>
<P>Supplement-pushers give people the God to have hope in (even the
<BR>
wafers), and libertarians provide the Devil to revile
<BR>
(government regulators, who try to confuse us with their
<BR>
sophistical, forked-tongued talk of &quot;p values,&quot; &quot;statistical
<BR>
significance,&quot; &quot;in vivo vs. in vitro,&quot; and all that annoying
<BR>
stuff).
<BR>
<P>Something to love, something to hate. Nice &amp; simple. No assembly
<BR>
required. Why ask why?
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
Brian.
<BR>
<P>P.S. Note that libertarianism is problematic, to me, mostly for
<BR>
reasons having nothing to do with life-extension.
<BR>
<P>[1] I haven't investigated his ideas thoroughly enough to be
<BR>
able to endorse them unqualifiedly, but I do think his general
<BR>
business approach is great. (And he seems like a good man.)
