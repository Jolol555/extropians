<EM>&gt; &gt; Robin has a paper on the topic of robots who try to use reversible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; computing.  My understanding was that there are unavoidable costs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; due to the non-reversible nature of the world,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as the robot senses and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; interacts with it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No. The big issue is the non-reversibility of the physical mechanism of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer's internal hardware. It doesn't really matter what the data in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer represents.

<P>For a robot to make a measurement in a reversible and non-dissipative
<BR>
manner is possible.  For it to reverse that measurement is also possible.
<BR>
However for the reversal to work I believe it is necessary that the
<BR>
outside world must be in the same state that it was in at the end of
<BR>
the measurement.  This was one of the points Robin made in his paper.
<BR>
<P>If the outside world is reversed when the robot is, as is possible if
<BR>
the robot is interacting with a VR, then this condition will be met.
<BR>
But if the outside world is the real world, then in general this condition
<BR>
cannot be met.  Things will have changed in the interim and when you do
<BR>
the reversal, the state of the measured system will not be the same as
<BR>
it was when the initial measurement was completed.
<BR>
<P>Therefore measurements can be reversed in the virtual world but not in the
<BR>
real world, and you thus have additional opportunities to save energy when
<BR>
interacting with a virtual world over interacting with a physical one.
