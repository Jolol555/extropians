What's Hot!
<BR>
-----------
<BR>
SNAKE VENOM TREATS STROKE
<BR>
The Journal of the American Medical Association this week published an
<BR>
article on the outcome of a trial of a new drug made from the venom of the
<BR>
Malaysian pit viper. Ancrod, made by Knoll Pharmaceuticals, acts by
<BR>
producing defibrinogenation in stroke patients. Depletion of fibrinogen
<BR>
creates and anticoagulative effect, and decreases the viscosity of blood
<BR>
leading to an improvement in circulation.

<BR>
<P>COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING NEGLECTED
<BR>
Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer in both men and
<BR>
women, with the exception of Hispanic, native American, Asian and Pacific
<BR>
Islander women for whom it ranks second. Lung, breast and prostate cancers
<BR>
remain the most frequently diagnosed cancers and a great amount of
<BR>
attention has been given to their prevention. Antismoking campaigns target
<BR>
all age groups, yearly mammograms are urged for women over forty and
<BR>
prostate screening tests such as an annual PSA are finally being given the
<BR>
attention they deserve.

Disease Therapy Protocols
<BR>
------------------------- 
<BR>
ADRENAL 
<BR>
The adrenals are two relatively crescent-shaped glands that are found
<BR>
lying over the upper pole of each kidney. Each adrenal gland consists of
<BR>
internal layers that produce different substances. The inner part, or
<BR>
adrenal medulla, manufactures epinephrine and norepinephrine, more
<BR>
commonly known as adrenaline and noradrenaline. These hormones are the
<BR>
&quot;fight or flight&quot; hormones that are released in potentially &quot;life or
<BR>
death&quot; situations. Their release increases heart rate and blood pressure
<BR>
and diverts more blood to the brain, heart, and skeletal muscles. This is
<BR>
important when discussing stress (see Anxiety and Stress protocol) as well
<BR>
as adrenal fatigue. 
<BR>
Cortisone and hydrocortisone regulate the body's glucose. Most readers are
<BR>
familiar with the administration of corticosteroids to suppress the immune
<BR>
system. Corticosteroids became available in the late 1940s and were
<BR>
heralded as a miraculous treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. It did not
<BR>
take long to find out that there was a serious price to pay for chronic
<BR>
corticosteroid use. Patients developed symptoms, and physical findings
<BR>
such as the development of Cushing's syndrome.

<BR>
<P>DIGESTIVE DISORDERS 
<BR>
It is estimated that more than 100 million people in America are affected
<BR>
by some form of digestive disease. That's more than half of the U.S.
<BR>
population! 
<BR>
For some people, digestive disorders are a source of irritation and
<BR>
discomfort that may cause them to drastically limit their life styles and
<BR>
miss work frequently. For others, these disorders may be extremely
<BR>
crippling, and even fatal. 
<BR>
Digest RC uses a layered delivery system to ensure that the various herbal
<BR>
extracts perform their intended function in the right part of the
<BR>
digestive tract. The ingredients are cultivated in Europe in a
<BR>
pesticide-free environment and are standardized to ensure uniform potency.
<BR>
The safety profile and demonstrated efficacy of herbs such as artichoke,
<BR>
black radish, and peppermint, particularly in standardized pharmaceutical
<BR>
grade extract form, suggest that here is the answer to the digestive
<BR>
problems of millions of Americans.

<BR>
SUPER DIGESTIVE ENZYME CAPS
<BR>
As humans age and the body's ability to break down food diminishes, a
<BR>
deficiency of pancreatic enzymes occurs. Since these enzymes are vital to
<BR>
maintain cellular function, a number of degenerative diseases may result. 
<BR>
SUPER DIGESTIVE ENZYMES are Life Extension Foundation's response to the
<BR>
need for a comprehensive enzyme supplement. Designed to adapt to a variety
<BR>
of stomach acid ph conditions. SUPER DIGESTIVE ENZYMES facilitates the
<BR>
digestion of protein, fat carbohydrates, fiber and milk lactose.
