Ever since I was young enough to come to the conclusion that the
<BR>
handfuls of big granite blocks in the woods near where I grew up were
<BR>
the leftovers of the pharoahs, I've been interested in such things. 
<BR>
The blocks date to CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) era work on the
<BR>
Boston area water supply and backup reservoirs, not even the Civil
<BR>
War era work for the base aquaduct system.  (West of Boston)
<BR>
No quarry-mark controversies there.
<BR>
<P>The thing that always strikes me about urban ruins is that they are
<BR>
generally in areas where the value of the real estate is cosmic.
<BR>
I'm probably seeing it wrong due to the microstructure of
<BR>
desirability in the urban landscape, but it's pretty amazing--as was
<BR>
wandering through Manhattan with a local woman who would periodically
<BR>
say something like &quot;I woudn't walk on that side of this street, on
<BR>
this block,&quot; while having chosen to walk on this side.  In general
<BR>
she could not say why--she'd grown up there.   I grew up in a suburb.
<BR>
I can believe in microstructure, but I don't see it well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From my larger perspective on what's happening, abandonment makes no
</EM><BR>
sense. I know that it will turn out that the company that owned the
<BR>
property as a tax loss is now held by a holding company that's being
<BR>
acquired by off-shore interests intending to..... and has in some
<BR>
cases just been lost, but surely that kind of thing couldn't cover
<BR>
the number of cases that seem to be out there. 
<BR>
<P>Ugh, my economics sense has reared its head.  Pier properties and
<BR>
other urban abandonments may be due to things that you can't easily
<BR>
see about the site that make the cost of construction or repair
<BR>
unbearable.   Also, the land could be so valuable that just paying
<BR>
the taxes on any improvements might mean that you would have to
<BR>
charge very high rents.  Like any other kind of parameter space,
<BR>
there can be locations that are very hard to get into.
<BR>
<P>Nice book on the subject of what's going on when cities arise and
<BR>
drain the rural areas: &quot;Falling Apart&quot; by Elaine Morgan (she of the
<BR>
aquatic ape business, on more conventional ground here).  I've always
<BR>
liked Morgan.  I really like her concept of urban &quot;convection.&quot;  The
<BR>
more people arrive, the more people are drawn.  This would run away
<BR>
but density limits show up pretty fast (for example in tenement
<BR>
construction technology in Roman times).   I see that &quot;Falling Apart&quot;
<BR>
is out of print.  Sigh.  
<BR>
<P>I love to photograph urban ruins, but it's been done to death, and I
<BR>
haven't found a personal angle on it yet.
