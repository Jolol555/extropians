<EM>&gt; SOURCE:   'The Mail on Sunday' May 7 2000:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dr Patrick Moore, the academic and renowned ecologist, was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a founder member of Greenpeace, and later became its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; president
</EM><BR>
<P>Thank you Charlie for giving us the British panorama. I had a feeling it was 
<BR>
something like that. It's good to have the full outlook. We have some 
<BR>
ultraconservative papers like that here too that my libertarian friends kept 
<BR>
sending me articles from (who lost all their credibility with frenetic Y2K 
<BR>
bug paranoia... but that's sidetracking...)
<BR>
<P>If someone can call Thatcher a pinko/commie...  
<BR>
I have story to tell:
<BR>
When I was in Stornoway Scotland I met with the GreenPeas rainbow ship 
<BR>
accidentally while they were doing some protest work off of Iceland.  We had 
<BR>
beer with them.
<BR>
What I was surprised to find out is that many of the crew are actually 
<BR>
outside mercenaries employed by Greenpeace, not foaming radicals at all. They 
<BR>
were complaining that Greenpeace wasn't real good about paying them...
