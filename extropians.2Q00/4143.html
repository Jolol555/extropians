If anyone else needs more structure (because, like me, your brain is too

|           Light Exceeds Its Own Speed Limit, or
<BR>
|           Does It?
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           By JAMES GLANZ
<BR>
|
<BR>
|                he speed at which light travels through
<BR>
|                a vacuum, about 186,000 miles per
<BR>
|           second, is enshrined in physics lore as a
<BR>
|           universal speed limit. Nothing can travel
<BR>
|           faster than that speed, according freshman
<BR>
|           textbooks and conversation at sophisticated
<BR>
|           wine bars; Einstein's theory of relativity
<BR>
|           would crumble, theoretical physics would
<BR>
|           fall into disarray, if anything could.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           Two new experiments have demonstrated
<BR>
|           how wrong that comfortable wisdom is.
<BR>
|           Einstein's theory survives, physicists say, but
<BR>
|           the results of the experiments are so mind-bending and weird
<BR>
| that the
<BR>
|           easily unnerved are advised--in all seriousness--not to read
<BR>
| beyond this
<BR>
|           point.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           In the most striking of the new experiments a pulse of light
<BR>
| that enters a
<BR>
|           transparent chamber filled with specially prepared cesium gas
<BR>
| is pushed
<BR>
|           to speeds of 300 times the normal speed of light. That is so
<BR>
| fast that,
<BR>
|           under these peculiar circumstances, the main part of the pulse
<BR>
| exits the far
<BR>
|           side of the chamber even before it enters at the near side.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           It is as if someone looking through a window from home were to
<BR>
| see a
<BR>
|           man slip and fall on a patch of ice while crossing the street
<BR>
| well before
<BR>
|           witnesses on the sidewalk saw the mishap occur--a preview of
<BR>
| the future.
<BR>
|           But Einstein's theory, and at least a shred of common sense,
<BR>
| seem to
<BR>
|           survive because the effect could never be used to signal back
<BR>
| in time to
<BR>
|           change the past--avert the accident, in the example.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           A paper on the experiment, by Lijun Wang of the NEC Research
<BR>
|           Institute in Princeton, N.J., has been submitted to Nature and
<BR>
| is currently
<BR>
|           undergoing peer review. It is only the most spectacular
<BR>
| example of work
<BR>
|           by a wide range of researchers recently who have produced
<BR>
| superluminal
<BR>
|           speeds of propagation in various materials, in hopes of
<BR>
| finding a chink in
<BR>
|           Einstein's armor and using the effect in practical
<BR>
| applications like speeding
<BR>
|           up electrical circuits.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           &quot;It looks like a beautiful experiment,&quot; said Raymond Chiao, a
<BR>
| professor
<BR>
|           of physics at the University of California in Berkeley, who,
<BR>
| like a number
<BR>
|           of physicists in the close-knit community of optics research,
<BR>
| is
<BR>
|           knowledgeable about Dr. Wang's work.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           Dr. Chiao, whose own research laid some of the groundwork for
<BR>
| the
<BR>
|           experiment, added that &quot;there's been a lot of controversy&quot;
<BR>
| over whether
<BR>
|           the finding means that actual information--like the news of an
<BR>
| impending
<BR>
|           accident--could be sent faster than c, the velocity of light.
<BR>
| But he said that
<BR>
|           he and most other physicists agreed that it could not.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           Though declining to provide details of his paper because it is
<BR>
| under
<BR>
|           review, Dr. Wang said: &quot;Our light pulses can indeed be made to
<BR>
| travel
<BR>
|           faster than c. This is a special property of light itself,
<BR>
| which is different
<BR>
|           from a familiar object like a brick,&quot; since light is a wave
<BR>
| with no mass. A
<BR>
|           brick could not travel so fast without creating truly big
<BR>
| problems for
<BR>
|           physics, not to mention humanity as a whole.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           A paper on the second new experiment, by Daniela Mugnai,
<BR>
| Anedio
<BR>
|           Ranfagni and Rocco Ruggeri of the Italian National Research
<BR>
| Council,
<BR>
|           described what appeared to be slightly faster-than-c
<BR>
| propagation of
<BR>
|           microwaves through ordinary air, and was published in the May
<BR>
| 22 issue
<BR>
|           of Physical Review Letters.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           The kind of chamber in Dr. Wang's experiment is normally used
<BR>
| to
<BR>
|           amplify waves of laser light, not speed them up, said Aephraim
<BR>
| M.
<BR>
|           Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto. In the
<BR>
| usual
<BR>
|           arrangement, one beam of light is shone on the chamber,
<BR>
| exciting the
<BR>
|           cesium atoms, and then a second beam passing thorugh the
<BR>
| chamber
<BR>
|           soaks up some of that energy and gets amplified when it passes
<BR>
| through
<BR>
|           them.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           But the amplification occurs only if the second beam is tuned
<BR>
| to a certain
<BR>
|           precise wavelength, Dr. Steinberg said. By cleverly choosing a
<BR>
| slightly
<BR>
|           different wavelength, Dr. Wang induced the cesium to speed up
<BR>
| a light
<BR>
|           pulse without distorting it in any way. &quot;If you look at the
<BR>
| total pulse that
<BR>
|           comes out, it doesn't actually get amplified,&quot; Dr. Steinberg
<BR>
| said.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           There is a further twist in the experiment, since only a
<BR>
| particularly strange
<BR>
|           type of wave can propagate through the cesium. Waves Light
<BR>
| signals,
<BR>
|           consisting of packets of waves, actually have two important
<BR>
| speeds: the
<BR>
|           speed of the individual peaks and troughs of the light waves
<BR>
| themselves,
<BR>
|           and the speed of the pulse or packet into which they are
<BR>
| bunched. A
<BR>
|           pulse may contain billions or trillions of tiny peaks and
<BR>
| troughs. In air the
<BR>
|           two speeds are the same, but in the excited cesium they are
<BR>
| not only
<BR>
|           different, but the pulses and the waves of which they are
<BR>
| composed can
<BR>
|           travel in opposite directions, like a pocket of congestion on
<BR>
| a highway,
<BR>
|           which can propagate back from a toll booth as rush hour
<BR>
| begins, even as
<BR>
|           all the cars are still moving forward.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           These so-called backward modes are not new in themselves,
<BR>
| having
<BR>
|           been routinely measured in other media like plasmas, or
<BR>
| ionized gases.
<BR>
|           But in the cesium experiment, the outcome is particularly
<BR>
| strange because
<BR>
|           backward light waves can, in effect, borrow energy from the
<BR>
| excited
<BR>
|           cesium atoms before giving it back a short time later. The
<BR>
| overall result is
<BR>
|           an outgoing wave exactly the same in shape and intensity as
<BR>
| the incoming
<BR>
|           wave; the outgoing wave just leaves early, before the peak of
<BR>
| the
<BR>
|           incoming wave even arrives.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           As most physicists interpret the experiment, it is a
<BR>
| low-intensity precursor
<BR>
|           (sometimes called a tail, even when it comes first) of the
<BR>
| incoming wave
<BR>
|           that clues the cesium chamber to the imminent arrival of a
<BR>
| pulse. In a
<BR>
|           process whose details are poorly understood, but whose effect
<BR>
| in Dr.
<BR>
|           Wang's experiment is striking, the cesium chamber reconstructs
<BR>
| the entire
<BR>
|           pulse solely from information contained in the shape and size
<BR>
| of the tail,
<BR>
|           and spits the pulse out early.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           If the side of the chamber facing the incoming wave is called
<BR>
| the near
<BR>
|           side, and the other the far side, the sequence of events is
<BR>
| something like
<BR>
|           the following. The incoming wave, its tail extending ahead of
<BR>
| it,
<BR>
|           approaches the chamber. Before the incoming wave's peak gets
<BR>
| to the
<BR>
|           near side of the chamber, a complete pulse is emitted from the
<BR>
| far side,
<BR>
|           along with a backward wave inside the chamber that moves from
<BR>
| the far
<BR>
|           to the near side.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           The backward wave, traveling at 300 times c, arrives at the
<BR>
| near side of
<BR>
|           the chamber just in time to meet the incoming wave. The peaks
<BR>
| of one
<BR>
|           wave overlap the troughs of the other, so they cancel each
<BR>
| other out and
<BR>
|           nothing remains. What has really happened is that the incoming
<BR>
| wave has
<BR>
|           &quot;paid back&quot; the cesium atoms that lent energy on the other
<BR>
| side of the
<BR>
|           chamber.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           Someone who looked only at the beginning and end of the
<BR>
| experiment
<BR>
|           would see only a pulse of light that somehow jumped forward in
<BR>
| time by
<BR>
|           moving faster than c.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           &quot;The effect is really quite dramatic,&quot; Dr. Steinberg said.
<BR>
| &quot;For a first
<BR>
|           demonstration, I think this is beautiful.&quot;
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           In Dr. Wang's experiment, the outgoing pulse had already
<BR>
| traveled about
<BR>
|           60 feet from the chamber before the incoming pulse had reached
<BR>
| the
<BR>
|           chamber's near side. That distance corresponds to 60
<BR>
| billionths of a
<BR>
|           second of light travel time. But it really wouldn't allow
<BR>
| anyone to send
<BR>
|           information faster than c, said Peter W. Milonni, a physicist
<BR>
| at Los
<BR>
|           Alamos National Laboratory. While the peak of the pulse does
<BR>
| get
<BR>
|           pushed forward by that amount, an early &quot;nose&quot; or faint
<BR>
| precursor of the
<BR>
|           pulse has probably given a hint to the cesium of the pulse to
<BR>
| come.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           &quot;The information is already there in the leading edge of the
<BR>
| pulse,&quot; Dr.
<BR>
|           Milonni said. &quot;You can get the impression of sending
<BR>
| information
<BR>
|           superluminally even though you're not sending information.&quot;
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           The cesium chamberhas reconstructed the entire pulse shape,
<BR>
| using only
<BR>
|           the shape of the precursor. So for most physicists, no
<BR>
| fundamental
<BR>
|           principles have been smashed in the new work.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           Not all physicists agree that the question has been settled,
<BR>
| though. &quot;This
<BR>
|           problem is still open,&quot; said Dr. Ranfagni of the Italian
<BR>
| group, which used
<BR>
|           an ingenious set of reflecting optics to create microwave
<BR>
| pulses that
<BR>
|           seemed to travel as much as 25% faster than c over short
<BR>
| distances.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           At least one physicist, Dr. Guenter Nimtz [[umlaut over u]] of
<BR>
| the
<BR>
|           University of Cologne, holds the opinion that a number of
<BR>
| experiments,
<BR>
|           including those of the Italian group, have in fact sent
<BR>
| information
<BR>
|           superluminally. But not even Dr. Nimtz believes that this
<BR>
| trick would
<BR>
|           allow one to reach back in time. He says, in essence, that the
<BR>
| time it
<BR>
|           takes to read any incoming information would fritter away any
<BR>
| temporal
<BR>
|           advantage, making it impossible to signal back and change
<BR>
| events in the
<BR>
|           past.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           However those debates end, however, Dr. Steinberg said that
<BR>
| techniques
<BR>
|           closely related to Dr. Wang's might someday be used to speed
<BR>
| up signals
<BR>
|           that normally get slowed down by passing through all sorts of
<BR>
| ordinary
<BR>
|           materials in circuits. A miniaturized version of Dr. Wang's
<BR>
| setup &quot;is
<BR>
|           exactly the kind of system you'd want for that application,
<BR>
| Dr. Steinberg
<BR>
|           said.
<BR>
|
<BR>
|           Sadly for those who would like to see a computer chip without
<BR>
| a speed
<BR>
|           limit, the trick would help the signals travel closer to the
<BR>
| speed of light,
<BR>
|           but not beyond it, he said.
