<P>Here's a candidate answer: why do our physicists and cosmologists
<BR>
insist on probing the early conditions of the universe? It's of minimal
<BR>
*practical* relevance to our day-to-day lives, but we are nevertheless,
<BR>
as a culture, accumulating a body of knowledge about the distant past.
<BR>
<P>Now extrapolate forward to a sentience-dominated universe. The
<BR>
emergence of intellience constitutes a phase-change in the structure
<BR>
of spacetime, if it gives rise to Moravec's hypothetical boiling wave
<BR>
of outbound intelligent matter, expanding at close to the speed of
<BR>
light and recycling all the dumb mass into thinking structure. Even
<BR>
if the process is relatively slow and conservative (Matrioshka brains
<BR>
as a local minimum in the curve of increasing intelligence/unit mass)
<BR>
it still has to *start somewhere*.
<BR>
<P>I figure that our current state of existence will be of as much interest
<BR>
to our far-future descendants as the precise condition of the universe
<BR>
circa 10^-44 seconds after the Big Bang is to us. It marks a phase-change
<BR>
without which our kind of life wouldn't exist; people who are curious
<BR>
about their origins _must_ consider it.  Therefore, _unless_ we assume
<BR>
that _all_ of our far-future mind children will be incurious about their
<BR>
origins, the probability of one of 'em running an emulation of the origin
<BR>
species all the way through to what we currently see as a singularity
<BR>
point is high.
<BR>
<P>It's like the Fermi paradox -- if there's intelligent life out there,
<BR>
we must assume that _all_ of them are incurious about interstellar
<BR>
exploration, or we'd already be knee deep in their artefacts; therefore
<BR>
either they aren't there, or we have completely missed some fundamental
<BR>
insight that only kicks in at a certain level of development that we
<BR>
haven't yet reached. (Robert Bradbury's MB hypothesis is an acceptable
<BR>
'missing insight'; they're out there, and they're so big that we've mistaken 
<BR>
them for part of the cosmological landscape -- but if we discount the MB
<BR>
hypothesis, we're left with &quot;we are the first&quot; as a logical conclusion.)
<BR>
By analogy, either _all_ successor intelligences will be incurious about
<BR>
their origins ... or we will end up being emulated.
