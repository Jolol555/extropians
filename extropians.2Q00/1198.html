<EM>&gt; &gt; In California if you're not a cop, you'd better be *darn*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sure that the suspect is guilty, especially if you resort to deadly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;force,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because if the suspect you shoot is not actually guilty of a felony you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; up a creek.  Even if you use non-deadly force you had better be sure 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; crime has in fact been committed and you had better have &quot;reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; grounds&quot; to belive that the suspect you arrested is the actual perp.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Short of this, you are just opening yourself up to being sued (and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; criminally charged) for assault, battery and false imprisonment.  All in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I say you're better off just calling 911.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;These are standards no different than what cops face every day. If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;witness the crime, you are considered responsible to affect an arrest.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well I can't speak for your part of the world, but in California the 
<BR>
standards for cops are less stringent.  So long as they can show probably 
<BR>
cause, they are immune from suit regardless of whether or not the person 
<BR>
they arrested actually committed the crime, and regardless of whether or not 
<BR>
a crime has in fact been committed.
<BR>
<P>Also, in California there is no responsibility to effect a citizens arrest 
<BR>
whenever you witness a crime.  In fact you have no obligation whatsoever to 
<BR>
even call the police.  So long as your conduct does not rise to the level of 
<BR>
&quot;aiding and abetting&quot; the crime, you can sit back and enjoy the 
<BR>
entertainment.
<BR>
<P>I do recall a Seinfeld episode where Jerry &amp; the gang were arrested for 
<BR>
failing to come to the aid of a crime victim when they traveled to (I think) 
<BR>
Massachusetts.  So there may be places in the world where the average 
<BR>
citizen does have the obligation to stop crimes in progress.  California, 
<BR>
thankfully, is not one of them.
