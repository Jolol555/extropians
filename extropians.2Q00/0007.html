<P><EM>&gt; This is always true of visionary proposals, whether by science fiction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  writers or people named Seward. What characterizes the late twentieth and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  early twenty-first century is a remarkable falling back from the dreams of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the Apollo decades (post World War 2). 
</EM><BR>
<P>As I've said before here, I am an irredeemable child of Apollo: Apparently no 
<BR>
amount of reasoning can convince me that the effort wasn't worthwhile and I 
<BR>
literally never tire of the story being retold.  But, as David Harland has 
<BR>
pointed out in his excellent recent book on the field geology accomplished by 
<BR>
the Apollo missions, &quot;Exploring the Moon&quot;, &quot;In retrospect, it is clear that 
<BR>
Apollo was an element of twenty-first century exploration which was somehow 
<BR>
drawn forward 50 years and, incredibly, implemented with early-1960s 
<BR>
electronics technology.&quot; (332-33)  He makes this comment in reviewing the 
<BR>
general plan for building space infrastructure that was almost universally 
<BR>
envisioned in the mid-20th century, before Apollo, i.e. first the 
<BR>
establishment of reusable, inexpensive access to space, then an orbital space 
<BR>
station and only then going on to explore and develop Luna and the rest of 
<BR>
the solar system.  I don't think that the people who originally conceived of 
<BR>
that plan, Oberth, Von Braun, Ley, Clarke and others, are or would be 
<BR>
surprised, therefore, that the supreme effort required to achieve the Apollo 
<BR>
goals was followed by a period of retreat.  In the historical context of 
<BR>
post-Vietnam politics and economics and the slow, steady erosion of Soviet 
<BR>
power during the 70s and 80s, it seems all the more inevitable.  Thus, Greg, 
<BR>
it is not the &quot;falling back from the dreams of the Apollo decades&quot; that is 
<BR>
remarkable, it was Apollo itself that was remarkable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  We're waiting for something to happen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  before we make the next leap, and I believe this something is a convincing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  model not just for economics in space, but for maintaining biological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  processes in space (one and the same thing, in my view!).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  A lot of people--many of them friends--are working hard to lower costs to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  orbit. NEO is already a proven money maker for some. But as Joe Carroll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  pointed out, we haven't done the complete closed loop habitat experiments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  necessary to convince anybody that we can survive for a couple of years in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  space without help from Earth. This is the biological equivalent of cutting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  lose from suppliers of venture capital; breaking even, paying off debts, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  making a profit!
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, and the &quot;GNR technologies&quot; (to borrow Bill Joy's term) are the key 
<BR>
to solving this problem, as well as the CAtS (Cheap Access to Space) problem. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Just as a number of technological innovations and a base level of economic 
<BR>
prosperity in Europe made exploration and settlement of the New World 
<BR>
possible (the square-rigged sale and the compass on the technological side 
<BR>
and the post-Black Death, Renaissance crop rotation and urbanization on the 
<BR>
economic side), so genetic engineering, nanotechnology and robotics will 
<BR>
create the background and tool-set for really exploiting the resources of the 
<BR>
solar system.  The truth is that 20th century technology just wasn't up to 
<BR>
the job.  Mid-21st century technology will be.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  When the culture as a whole is presented with convincing evidence for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  solutions to these hard practicalities, the visionaries will be back in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  favor.
</EM><BR>
<P>You bet!  (And so do I).
