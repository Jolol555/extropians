<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; This is a false dichotomy.  Those who are found not to lock up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; their guns by something happening (like a kid finding one and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; running around with it) should lose the right to keep and bear,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; as they have demonstrated that they are incapable of exercising
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; such a right prudently and responsibly.  This does not require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; registration, just revocation subsequent to violations coming to light.

<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; OK, I'd agree with that plan.  However, ever gun-control advocate I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; been exposed to has wanted some sort of ability to restrict ownership
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; before the fact.

<EM>&gt;Joe just won't admit to it. The severity of his idea indicates his sentiment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have said that parents whose kids commit gun crimes should be held responsible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for negligent homicide. Finding a kid merely in posession (on the way to rifle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or skeet team practice)  does not justify what Joe wants. Joe wants to prevent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all those crack baby gang bangers from being able to protect themselves (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cause trouble), but is also satisfied to throw the baby out with the bath water
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and prohibit harmless use by kids. My dad, living in Lowell, Mass as a kid,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would often ride on the bus, or on his bike, with rifle or shotgun in hand (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;across his handlebars) so he could participate on the rifle team, or to go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hunting with freinds after school...they never had any problems or misuse.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Well, we are having problems now.  I myself have no problem with the ADULT-SUPERVISED use of firearms for hunting or target practice by minors (I myself was trained by and hunted with my father and uncles when I was a boy and, as a result, qualified as a sharpshooter as soon as I hit the military range), but if a minor gets hold of a gun when (s)he is not supposed to, the adult whose negligence allowed it to happen has proven him/herself unworthy of the public trust which is essential to stewardship of simple and esay means of committing rapid and long-range mass murder, and should not be allowed the opportunity to, through the repetition of such neglect, endanger his/her fellow citizens again.
