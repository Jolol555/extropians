<EM>&gt; Well, admittedly, he IS pro-whatsit.  ;) That is, his rallying cry is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a charge towards &quot;Open society.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, this is what I had though.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'd always thought you'd have thought him one of the good guys. Hmmmm.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Welll...  Unlike certain others on this list who can't tell the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference between a liberal and a Nazi, 
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is what keeps me on other lists as I can't be bothered with that
<BR>
much hubris-building. I am only writing now because my mail filters
<BR>
managed to stuff up saving a post in the extropy folder and I read the
<BR>
subject line about Sasha being dead, and I immediately jumped in here to
<BR>
find out that it was a hoax. And it wasn't. Sigh. BIG sigh.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (of which, let me get this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfectly clear, Soros is the former, and not the latter) I'd say that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while I wouldn't call him one of the &quot;good guys,&quot; he's better than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most of the bad guys out there.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Well, this was my thinking. I'd always thought, based on my very cursory
<BR>
knowledge, that he was pro-democracy and all those other funky
<BR>
buzzwords.
<BR>
<P>What's so bad about him? His predatory speculation/investing strategy?  
<BR>
I'm sort of curious, as I had always thought he was one of the few very
<BR>
rich people who were making any headway as far as doing good goes...
