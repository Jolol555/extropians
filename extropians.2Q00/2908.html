</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If privacy is property, as are all other Rights, how can my property be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;taken without due process?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You have no right to privacy when you are in public. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Says who? Perhaps not out there in Hollywood where everyone's life is
<BR>
for sale all the time, but not elsewhere. People have a right to be
<BR>
respected and treated considerately wherever they are. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Is asserting that only criminals value privacy, the same thing as saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;privacy is contraband?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps, I don't know.  But that's not *quite* what I have said.  What I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *have* said is that if your deeds are admirable, usually you don't fear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being observed doing them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Except when they are nobody's damn business. You don't need to know who
<BR>
I am sleeping with, you don't need to know where I do business, and
<BR>
where I work, or what I do on the weekends.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If privacy is only to be held by the govmnt for national security purposes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;then is it not munitions as encryption is?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps.  But as with other &quot;munitions&quot; the government can only use them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against her own citizens under *very* limited circumstances.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If my personal information has value, and that personal information is made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;use of, where is my payment for the use?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would agree that if someone makes a profit from merely disseminating your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal information, you should be entitled to a cut.
</EM><BR>
<P>They you would go on to say that the money government makes off of your
<BR>
information reduces the amount that government has to tax you, assuming
<BR>
you have any other say in what you get taxed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Can the govment take responsibility for any damage that may be cause
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of dispersal of my property to those who would do me harm?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Except under certain specified circumstances, the government *can* certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be sued for damages it may cause you.
</EM><BR>
<P>The government gets to decide who it lets sue it. Hardly an unbiased
<BR>
venue, eh?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If disclosure of some information that is not volunteered by me causes me a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;harm, who is liable?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Assuming you are damaged by a tortious or criminal disclosure of information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about you, then the discloser would be liable to you for those damages.
</EM><BR>
<P>Or the corporate entity in whose name the disclosure was made. You
<BR>
privacy gets compromised every day by government, mostly at your state
<BR>
DMV. How many times do you think the Privacy Act is used to prosecute a
<BR>
government bureaucrat? Rarely.
