<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Y'know, I seem to recall exactly this argument having been a political

football for the USA back in the ninteen-teens, with respect to emigrants

from eastern Europe. Funnily enough, it didn't happen that way ...&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Those were different times, and different immigrants. Also, there were pauses 
<BR>
between the various waves of immigrants, in which society could adjust. 
<BR>
Nowadays it is a continuos onslaught. I'll quote from:
<BR>
IMMIGRATION'S REAL VICTIMS: ALL AMERICAN GROUPS SUFFER BECAUSE OF IMMIGRATION 
<BR>
while their corrupted politicians play the violin and delay necessary 
<BR>
actions...by Samuel Francis (an excellent article, you really should read it, 
<BR>
see 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://webusers.anet-stl.com/~civil/imamericansharmed.html">http://webusers.anet-stl.com/~civil/imamericansharmed.html</A>).
<BR>
<P>&quot;The 30 million immigrants who have arrived in the last quarter century are 
<BR>
overwhelmingly from non-European Third World societies, and as a whole they 
<BR>
bring with them many of the ideas, habits, and manners that make their native 
<BR>
countries Third World in character: the lack of a work ethic, an inclination 
<BR>
toward authoritarian and often violent political behavior, and an 
<BR>
unfamiliarity and uneasiness with the religious, educational, hygienic, 
<BR>
scientific, and moral conventions of the West that most Americans take for 
<BR>
granted.
<BR>
<P>The U.S. Census Bureau has published at least two reports showing that by the 
<BR>
middle of the next century less than 60 years from now the United States will 
<BR>
cease to be a nation with a majority of its population descended from 
<BR>
Europeans and will acquire a non-European majority. The conclusion is simple: 
<BR>
Because of uncontrolled immigration, the United States is in grave danger of 
<BR>
becoming a Third World country within the next half century.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Poor countries usually are the way they are because the people there don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have what it takes to create a prosperous, civilized society. You can blame 
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; on their big bad governments, but let's not forget that those governments 
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; just as much an expression of local culture as anything else.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&quot;Ah, the poor uncivilized inferior peoples canot be trusted to govern
</EM><BR>
themselves!&quot; was always the rallying cry of the imperialist.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>As a matter of fact, colonial rule was -certainly its later years- by far the 
<BR>
best period in most 3rd world nations' history, with standards of living not 
<BR>
seen before or since. This is certainly the case in Africa.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;A lot of
</EM><BR>
those countries you're complaining about are the way they are because
<BR>
until relatively recently (20-60 years ago) they were run as imperial
<BR>
dominions by one European colonial power or another -- or the US. Direct
<BR>
imperial rule went out of fashion after 1945, but was largely replaced
<BR>
by hands- off remote economic control; former colonial governments
<BR>
that didn't play by the rules laid down by the colonial power tended to
<BR>
undergo revolutions. Do you know what happened in Iran in 1956? Or in
<BR>
Vietnam in 1949? A lot of your own country's history is tied up in those
<BR>
dark colonial-era deeds ...&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Excuses, excuses. The countries that always had the more capable people (like 
<BR>
portions of India, various Asian countries) did fairly well after colonial 
<BR>
rule, while others, whose populations were significantly less capable, 
<BR>
immediately started to decline to their former level, and would surely have 
<BR>
hit rock bottom had the &quot;evil&quot; ex-colonialists not continued to support them. 
<BR>
It's no coincidence that white-dominated South Africa became the economic 
<BR>
powerhouse of the whole region, and that Zimbabwe, where, until recently, 
<BR>
whites were heavily involved in economical matters did fairly well. Now that 
<BR>
they're chasing the whites out and ransacking their properties, they'll no 
<BR>
doubt soon join their continent's list of ultra-poor nations.
<BR>
<P>See also this great article which explains why Africa is the way it is:

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Now you -- a citizen of one of those rich colonial powers -- have the
</EM><BR>
sheer effrontery to say that it's essential to keep out _precisely_ those
<BR>
natives of poor countries who are trying to improve their personal lot,
<BR>
and to insist that collectivism (stay at home! stay at home!) is the
<BR>
solution to their problems! I find that really ugly.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Tell me, what good will it do if we allow the 1st world to turn into a 3rd 
<BR>
world?
<BR>
Who is going to feed the poor then, huh? Who is going to defend our relatively 
<BR>
free, democratic way of life (it may not be perfect, but it sure beats the 
<BR>
alternatives)? Who is going to find technological solutions to the world's 
<BR>
increasing problems? Who is going to make us Transhuman? Think before you hit 
<BR>
that keyboard, man! If you really want to help them, re-instate colonial rule 
<BR>
(no kidding) and/or help to advance the Singularity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;(I find it also
</EM><BR>
bespeaks a streak of racism that runs very close to the surface, but
<BR>
that's another matter.)&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Thanks to people like you, &quot;racism&quot; has become a rather meaningless word; 
<BR>
nowadays it can mean anything from hard-core KKK propaganda to the mildest 
<BR>
criticism of some clearly irrational PC ideology/policy. Say /anything/ 
<BR>
remotely negative about certain ethnic groups (not whites, obviously) and 
<BR>
you're a &quot;racist&quot;. Yeah, long live free speech...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;The vast majority of these people are trying to
</EM><BR>
emigrate *because they want to better themselves*.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>At pretty much all costs. And not really to better themselves, just to have 
<BR>
mo' money. Sure, can't really blame 'em, but if it's &quot;you or them&quot; the choice 
<BR>
is pretty easy. Again, feel free to give all your money to aid organizations 
<BR>
or whatever, no-one is stopping you. Go live in the 3rd world if you like it 
<BR>
so much, but /don't/ mess up civilized societies with your follies. It took 
<BR>
many generations and a lot of hard work to build what we have today (and what 
<BR>
a piece of work it is, compared to the rest of the world) yet people like you 
<BR>
would squander it all just to stroke their inflated, self-righteous egos.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;That comes with a 
</EM><BR>
willingness to work for a pittance at jobs that no privileged citizen of
<BR>
a developed nation would touch, because that's the way to guarantee a
<BR>
better future.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>No, it's a dead end for most of them, and desperate people can be very 
<BR>
dangerous. Even if we assume that they can find a job and hold on to it, they 
<BR>
may be happy at first with their /relative/ wealth, but living conditions are 
<BR>
more expensive too in the free world, and they'll soon notice how poor they 
<BR>
really are compared to the &quot;natives&quot;. They're only human; /of course/ they'll 
<BR>
soon want more than just the bare necessities; they'll want our flashy 
<BR>
consumer products which they'll see advertised all around them. But...most 
<BR>
won't have the skills and/or discipline to get decent jobs. Some will stay 
<BR>
poor, honest and miserable but others will take the easy way out and turn to 
<BR>
crime. Plenty of opportunities for /that/ in the land of the free, as the 
<BR>
gang-bangers know.
<BR>
<P>It's not so much the first wave of immigrants that's the problem as their 
<BR>
offspring. /They/ haven't witnessed the poverty of their parents' homeland; 
<BR>
they just know that they are at the bottom of their society with little hope 
<BR>
of moving up. That breeds frustration, envy, hatred and ultimately...violence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Your country was *built* by people like that.&lt;&lt;
</EM><BR>
<P>It wasn't built by people from the 3rd world, but by (mostly) Europeans. That 
<BR>
makes a lot of difference. Had immigration patterns been from the very 
<BR>
beginning like they have been during the last 30 years, the US /would/ now be 
<BR>
3rd world nation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;That you have the gall to
</EM><BR>
want to shut them out says more about your own inadequacy than anything
<BR>
else I could write.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>What a load of bull. No offence, but you, sir, have your head up your ass.
