<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; implication is that as soon as we use a device, say, fridge, TV, car, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; our choices will be uploaded to the Internet and a record will be made of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; every detail of our life.  It will be like having an aircraft &quot;black box&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; recorder in every device. No hope of any privacy here!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  And you know, it wont be as bad as we think.  It never is.  Thousands
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  of mechanical sensors will note how we walk, how we smell, the shape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  of our faces, and will figure out where everyone is at all times and what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  we are doing, and yet it will be ok.  People will become special, kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  of like gods in a way, will we not?  Our machines will look up to us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  and respect us and help us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Just thought I would toss this out to see what happens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Two things happened in my head.  First, the memory of Richard Brautigan's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poem &quot;All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace&quot; came to mind - for the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first time in many years.  I wonder how many of the Really Old Timers on the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list remember that poem as a first intimation of transhumanism?
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; Consider the deep reservoir of animistic concepts and feelings we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have from our primitive past....  As our property becomes infused with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence of higher and higher orders, I can see a return to this kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of social activity.  A truly &quot;smart car&quot; will not require a physical key -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or not a physical key alone.  It will really recognize its owner and be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programmed with behaviors of &quot;loyalty&quot; to her.
</EM><BR>
<P>I remember reading an article with a similar theme back when I was in
<BR>
college, in the mid 1970s.  I think it was by Newell or Simon, one of
<BR>
the AI pioneers who had worked on the &quot;general problem solver&quot; paradigm,
<BR>
and it described the goals of their AI program at CMU.
<BR>
<P>As he put it, the ultimate goal of AI was to recreate the world of
<BR>
Faerie.  Lampposts would contain helpful animistic spirits that would
<BR>
help travellers find their way, and so on.  The world would come alive,
<BR>
embued with intelligence as in the old stories.
<BR>
<P>It was a very well written essay and made me consider going into AI for
<BR>
a while.   I can't find it on the web but maybe a copy exists somewhere.
