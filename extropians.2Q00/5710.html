<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; [car security]
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Actually, there is a nice system that originated in South Africa that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; consists of some short duration flame throwers that shoot up from under
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the rocker panel, covering the doors on both sides of the vehicles.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Supposedly very effective in deterring and preventing carjackings.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nice idea, but would never be allowed in Germany. Has this system ever been
<BR>
produced for the common market? As I have many friends in Eastern Europe,
<BR>
where carjacking is a major problem when you have an expensive car, they
<BR>
would be very intersted in such a system.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; The way to secure your car most cheaply is to live where so many law
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; abiding people are armed that a car thief is more likely to be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; apprehended by an armed civilian than to escape with the vehicle or its
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; contents. Where I live most people don't even have to lock their cars.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The concept of the security of one's private property is part and parcel
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of one's right to personal security. Its understood that your countries
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; suffer from a higher percentage of five fingered socialists, always
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; willing to redistribute your stuff to themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is not the &quot;five - fingered socialists&quot; but the white-collar
<BR>
socialists who run this country. Our actual political system is closer to
<BR>
Socialism than to my understanding of Democracy.
<BR>
<P>There is also a difference between living in a big city like Frankfurt and
<BR>
living in the country like my parents do. I do seldom lock my car when I am
<BR>
there as I never heard of such crimes in that region.
<BR>
<P>BTW: A friend of me from southern Italy once told me of a small town where
<BR>
there is absolutely no crime. It is the home town of a large mafia clan, and
<BR>
they keep it clean. About ten years ago there was a thief in town. He was
<BR>
found some time later on the bottom of the harbor.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; What is your life worth when your life savings and property have been
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; destroyed or stolen? A person who would steal the product of your labor
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; is stealing your time, is stealing your life, is enslaving and killing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; you. Just because the theif only takes a small portion of your life
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; makes him no less a killer than one who takes your entire life at once.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Lets say a pickpocket steals my insulin kit, and I'm visiting a city in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; europe where few people around speak english to a degree to understand
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; my needs as a diabetic. I go into insulin shock and die. Should the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; thief be charged with murder, or just for petty theft? He only stole
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; maybe $100 worth of medical equipment and drugs. Thats not much. But it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; was the difference between life and death for me. Even if I reach
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; medical attention in time to save my life, the toxic shock has
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; irreversibly shortened my life, so years of my life have been stolen,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; not just a mere $100 worth of medical equipment, and my life was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; threatened. Lets say I pull my legally owned pistol when the pickpocket
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; grabs my medical kit, and hold him at gun point. I can justifiably say
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; my life was threatened, can't I? Was ALL of my life threatened, or just
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; part of it? Which part? The part represented by the $100 invested in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; insulin kit? Or the possible years taken off the end of my life by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; insulin shock? Or would it be the entire remainder of my life if I could
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; have died?
</EM><BR>
<P>I do have my own oppinion on this, but as I am a law student, I know the
<BR>
official way the law would handle this: Certainly the thief would not get
<BR>
punished for murder, he would - perhaps, if it is a good day - get a
<BR>
sentence for accidental killing. Anyway, our laws are way to soft. But as it
<BR>
was not his intention to kill, you could hardly try him for murder.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;&gt; criminal sued them for severe injury. In the end, the criminal
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;was sentenced
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; less hard than those who had helped the victim. And that is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;definitely not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; just!
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Very much so. There are places here like that, very socialist states
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; like Massachusetts, where such idiocy is allowed to be considered common
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; jurisprudence.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did not know that such things happen in the US. But I doubt that this is a
<BR>
sign of &quot;Socialism&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;&gt; That is one fact. In Europe, possession of arms is restricted.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; But the &quot;bad
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; guys&quot; also have limited weapons. If you would allow anyone to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; carry weapons,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; then the bad guys will certainly carry them. Although I would
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; have prefered
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; to have a gun as long as I lived in Frankfurt, I doubt that it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; would have
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; done any good. If you are unarmed, well, you can get beaten up
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; or robbed.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; Okay. If you are armed, you get shot. Okay, if you are a combat-trained
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; gunslinger, you might be able to shoot them, but most people
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; aren't. So this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; is no big defense. The bad guys usually have more guns, more
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; firepower and,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; ost important, the least problems of using them.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The 'bad guys' in europe have all the weapons they want. The bad guys
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; carry them whether law abiding people have them or not. If a criminal is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; so bold as to decide to take your life in defiance of the law against
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; murder, what makes you think a little thing like a weapons law will keep
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; him from getting a gun. BTW: I've always wanted to ask a German this:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; How does it feel to still be living under laws drafted under the Nazi
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; regeime?
</EM><BR>
<P>First of all, Psychology tell us that few criminals have an interest in
<BR>
killing others without a cause. The cause could be money. If the victim is
<BR>
unarmed, killing is not necessary, threatening with a weapon usually is
<BR>
enough. In Germany we have a very low rate of Murder, with 381 cases of
<BR>
murder. There were a total of 12.448 cases of weapons usage only as a
<BR>
threat. So you could say that we have a very, very low rate of crimes with
<BR>
actual wepaons usage. The crime rate in the US is quite different: 1998 ther
<BR>
were 14088 cases of murder.
<BR>
<P>The German code of laws has not being drafted by the Nazi regime. Though
<BR>
many laws have been changed under in the Nazi time, these changes were
<BR>
reversed after the war. The history of Greman law is much older: The civil
<BR>
code of law, &quot;Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch&quot;, was published 1900, it based on the
<BR>
Prussian Land Law &quot;Preussisches Landrecht&quot;, which was around 200 years
<BR>
older, which in turn based on the Carolina, published under Emperor Karl V
<BR>
around 1500 AD. This in turn had its origins mostly on the Roman law, but
<BR>
also in the laws of the Germanic people.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;&gt; Weapons do no harm. It's the people who use them. Most of the people who
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; have guns neve use them. At least not on other people. Even
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; most criminals
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; would not deliberately use excessive force to achieve their goal. If all
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; people have guns, the criminal is forced to use maximum force to achieve
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; their goal without danger for themselves. The problem of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; liberal gun laws is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; that the tendency to use them will increase.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; No. you are very wrong there. States here that have liberal gun laws
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; have shown very little use in crime. It is in states and cities that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; have very restrictive gun laws where most gun crime occurs.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM> &gt;From my point of view here in Germany I do not have a good possiblity of
</EM><BR>
anaylzing the differences between the US states. In the News it's simply the
<BR>
US. If this is indeed true, then this would be some good argument, as I
<BR>
personally do not agree wit hthe strict gun laws here. But I have a problem
<BR>
with a general freedom to carry weapons. Weapons are most dangerous in the
<BR>
hands of people who are not able to use them. In any case I would allow any
<BR>
lawful citizen to carry a weapon, I would demand him to obatain a license
<BR>
much similar to a driveng license.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;&gt;&gt; I have heard stories of severe thievery in Europe and on a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;&gt; sophisticated level that dates back centuries.  I did not know
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;&gt; they suffered from apathy when it comes to intervening in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;&gt; situations such as an ongoing rape.  I know that has happened in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;&gt; the United States.  What parts of Europe are you talking about?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; Well, that is indeed a problem. A 17 year old girl was raped in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Hamburg, by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; day (!) and in a crowded local train (!!). I do not understand
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hos something
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; like this can happen in my country. Though I made the shocking
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; experience
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; that this is common in this country, though rarely in such an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; extreme case.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; Most violations are never reported due to the shame of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; victims, which
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; makes it only worse. The problem here is not guns but simply the way of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; thinking. As long as this does not change, the way people
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; behave will not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; change.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; That way of thinking is the thinking of well conditioned sheep. Any
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; society that would convict good samaritans deserves the crime it gets.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; We had similar problems here in the states in the 1960s and 1970's,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; where criminals would sue people who apprehended them, and police and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; prosecutors would convict good samaritans. Finally people got sick of it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and got the legislature to pass good samaritan laws, and they formed
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; neighborhood watch groups, like the Guardian Angels.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, most people are well-conditioned sheep. I sometimes have the
<BR>
impression that people bave become so single-minded that they simply do not
<BR>
understand that i f they don't act, they could be next.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;&gt; If we look at the overall facts, crimes like burglary or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; robbery might be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; more frequent in Europe. But definitely the rate of murder and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; other capital
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; crimes is much higher in the US. If faced with the choice, I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; would always
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; prefer Europe. Property can be restored, that's why we have
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; insurances. But
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt; no insurance can give you back your life.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; You yourself pay for the property to be restored, since you pay much
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; higher insurance premiums than I do. In the meantime, some of your life
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; has been stolen, just as sure as if it had been killed off with a knife
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; or a pistol...
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, if you see it this way, the German state is the biggest thief, as we
<BR>
have substantially higher taxes as you have. And that's a lot more than the
<BR>
insurance.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;&gt; Like the Romans said: Ab igne ignem. - Out of the fire - fire.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; They also said &quot;come home with your shield, or on it.&quot; Stand like a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Roman against the barbarians and fight and win, or fight and die, or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; don't come home at all. In the Roman Republic, only the serfs, the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; slaves, were disarmed. Now you want us all to be slaves?
</EM><BR>
<P>Now we get to the point. The question behind all this discussion is moral.
<BR>
It is a question of the ethical values and how to apply them. It might seem
<BR>
arrogant, but our system of laws is by far superior to that of the UK or the
<BR>
US. We have ended the era of court law about five hundred years ago when
<BR>
Emperor Karl V compiled a code of laws for the Holy Roman Empire. That
<BR>
marked a change from the meideval system of feudal and court law. By the
<BR>
way, the Romans also had a complete system of laws. Besides that I do not
<BR>
like the idea of 12 laymen judging over things they do not really
<BR>
understand. But what are the moral values that underlie each system? And
<BR>
that's the great gap that we must close before we can compare the US with
<BR>
Europe.
<BR>
<P>The freedom to carry weapons is part of the US constitution. It is not part
<BR>
of our constitution. It is part of our tradition which comes from imperial
<BR>
times where the right to carry a wepaon was a priviledge. I would prefer if
<BR>
every good citizen would be allowed to carry a weapon if he were able to use
<BR>
it, much in the same way as you are allowed to drive after you have proven
<BR>
your skill. But I doublt that this will be possible here in the near future.
<BR>
The laws for carrying a gun are very, very strict in Germany. The idea
<BR>
behind this is that the police is guarding the people. As this is a fiction
<BR>
by now, the police will normally apear only after everything has happened or
<BR>
not at all, I have taken a license to possess a weapon. But that is very,
<BR>
very difficult to obtain. And the laws are getting stricter all the time! I
<BR>
hope that this tendency will reverse at some time.
<BR>
