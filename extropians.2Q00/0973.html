</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Excuse me, but isn't this discussion rather pointless?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I think it is more important to be a cosmopolitan than a patriot, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;nations are just construtions. What distinguishes a Mexican from a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Honduran? Nothing, just political boundaries. And I personally see that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;have more in common with people on this international list than with most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Swedes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Fighting for civil liberties is very good, but just doing it in your own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;country won't do it, because the world is so closely connected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Think locally, act globally!
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  you are right in that, however you can't do something that radical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without starting gradually, first you have to assure that the place of land
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you live aka country has a democratic government with the wish to cooperate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with their neighboors, when that starts to happen, the exchange of culture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and economies, starts to blur the barrier between them and help us be more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a global village, however like you've seen not all people thinks in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way, and the antiglobal sentiment is very high, still I predict that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;countries will start to disappear gradually as more and more people gets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;connected, when we get higher bandwidth for all, and the emerging vr
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technologies are perfected it won't matter anymore where you are from but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who you are.
</EM><BR>
<P>But you have to start with a cosmopolitan, globalized ideology from the very 
<BR>
beginning. Otherwise there is no alternative to the present order. The 
<BR>
technologies you listed don't have to lead to the disappearance of nations 
<BR>
at all! It depends on what ideas that drive the users. Cosmopolitanism is a 
<BR>
state of mind, not something that is technologically ordained.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
