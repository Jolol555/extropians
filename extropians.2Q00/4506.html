When you argue about &quot;real reality&quot; versus our &quot;mental
<BR>
spreadsheet&quot; you fight a very strange battle.  People
<BR>
in these kinds of situations tend to choose one side
<BR>
or the other and stay with it.  
<BR>
Here's what I mean:  suppose, for example, that there
<BR>
is an infinite difference between our mental
<BR>
spreadsheet and reality... this means that we would
<BR>
have no way of telling what sort of reality we are
<BR>
living in and therefore no mechanism with which to
<BR>
determine our actions or their relevance to this
<BR>
&quot;real&quot; reality.  
<BR>
Suppose the opposite: that our mental spreadsheet and
<BR>
reality were a one-to-one match.In this case, somehow,
<BR>
there would be no difference between what we believed
<BR>
we saw and what was actually there.. in that case, we
<BR>
would still be stuck with the possibility of as much
<BR>
as infinite difference because of our own reasoning: 
<BR>
i.e., even though there is no significant effective
<BR>
difference in the reality I have experienced so far
<BR>
and the realities I have experienced in the past,
<BR>
(their laws or properties appear to be static as far
<BR>
as my memory *now* indicates*), it is reasonable to
<BR>
assume that this instant or moment could be a pure
<BR>
fantastical generation on the part of some other
<BR>
agent, external or internal to myself.
