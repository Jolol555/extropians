<EM>&gt; &gt;Thats how much crime is here as well, only the media spins the story based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the circumstances. If Bum A was a woman and Bum B was a man, its a case of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;'domestic violence' or 'stalking'. If Bum A is black and bum B is white, its a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;'racist hate crime killing', while if it were the other way around,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;'gang violence'. If the ratty apartment were near a school campus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and both bums
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;were students, it would be a 'school shooting'. If Bum B was working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for Bum A,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it would be a 'crazed worker going postal' incident, and if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;'apartment' was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the back of Bum A's van, then its 'murder on the highways'.

<EM>&gt; Mike, are there legal definitions of domestic violence, stalking,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; racist crime, hate crime or gang crime where you live?  If so, are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you saying that the media report a different crime than what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; police report?  It seems like a suspect could easily win a slander
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suit against a news organization that deliberately misreported a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crime or an arrest that never occurred.
</EM><BR>
<P>It happens all the time on national TV and in the press. They get away
<BR>
with it because its not called 'news' its called 'news analysis', which
<BR>
is a muddy way of editorializing the news without admitting that its
<BR>
just opinion. The press never has, and never will be confused by the
<BR>
actual facts. I don't think its humanly possible for them to report a
<BR>
story accurately.
