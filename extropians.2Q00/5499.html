I think it's about time to throw in my $US 0.02 First let me introduce 
<BR>
myself, mercifully briefly. For a while now I have been lurking on the list 
<BR>
and found the conversation for the most part quite interesting reading. When 
<BR>
religion was brought up however I felt I had to respond, it being a theme 
<BR>
rather near and dear to my heart. Officially I am a Reverend within the 
<BR>
Church of Discord and, to my knowlege, am recognized as such by the State. 
<BR>
(my official title is Chaplain of the Legion of Dynamic Discord and Episkopos 
<BR>
of the Order of the Sleepless (k)Nights). It appears many people on this 
<BR>
lists would describe themselves as atheists and are quite proud of it. In an 
<BR>
attempt to offer some balance I will argue for pseudo religion. Personally I 
<BR>
do not think all religions are invalid, but neither is one the True religion. 
<BR>
Divinity can be approached in almost any fashion to my mind, some methods 
<BR>
work quite well for me that are nigh useless to others and vice versa. 
<BR>
Religion is nothing more or less than a framework to approach Divinty with. 
<BR>
The problem arises with assumption of the One True Religion which I would say 
<BR>
does not exist. Atheism, on the other hand, has the equally silly claim that 
<BR>
since none of them is the One True Religion, then none of them are True. All 
<BR>
of them are True in the sense that they can allow one to relate to Divinity. 
<BR>
I would also like to ask all of you to take a charitable approach to the 
<BR>
clergy for they do, for the most part, mean well. When I followed the 
<BR>
Christian faith I was quite devout and would witness to all who would listen 
<BR>
because I genuinely feared for their immortal soul. Now that I am no longer 
<BR>
those who do the same to me seem incredibly irritating and small minded. So, 
<BR>
having been on both sides of the fence I ask you to please be patient and 
<BR>
somewhat forgiving for &quot;they know not what they do&quot;.

<P>&quot;There is absolutely no scientific evidence to prove life after death. But 
<BR>
then there is no evidence to disprove life after death. Sooner of later you 
<BR>
will KNOW, so why worry about it?&quot; - Lazarus Long
<BR>
<P>&quot;....'Oh drat!' says God as he vanishes in a puff of logic. Man then goes on 
<BR>
to prove that black is white and gets himself killed at the next zebra 
<BR>
crossing.&quot; - Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
