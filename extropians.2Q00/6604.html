</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What's the evidence that this is actually the case, to any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant degree?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I mean, 90% marginal rates, sure, but I think even Sweden's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; backed off from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, you either have to tax or mess around with the money supply to come up
<BR>
with the funds to make the welfare payments. Like you say, TANSTAAFL.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; The reason I say this discourages innovation is that it tends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to preserve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the staus quo.  This is intuitively obvious, and I've seen it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operate time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not to my intuition.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I didn't do a very good job of writing that paragraph (in fact I'd go
<BR>
so far as to say it sucked), but I'm not sure it would have been that much
<BR>
more convincing even if it had been a brilliant piece of writing. It
<BR>
probably seems obvious to me because I've worked with so many people who
<BR>
were struggling to start businesses and I've started businesses myself, and
<BR>
so many times the money that goes for taxes would have made all the
<BR>
difference between success and failure. Does it help to say that the new
<BR>
business owner is financing the whole thing with &quot;after tax&quot; dollars?
<BR>
<P>There was another thing I didn't like about that message.  It gave a
<BR>
misleading impression about the business failure I was describing, in that I
<BR>
still had a livlihood even after the business went belly-up.  I was running
<BR>
a law practice on the side, and I still had it going.  So there's another
<BR>
way to have a cushion, like Emlyn is doing by taking a part time job--keep
<BR>
more than one project going at a time.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;BTW, the business failure wasn't the end of the world, in fact in some ways
<BR>
it was a relief.  As I was pedalling away into the night, I was singing the
<BR>
song _Me and Bobby McGee_ which has the line, &quot;Freedom's just another word
<BR>
for nothing left to lose.&quot;
<BR>
<P>It seems as though these political discussions never go anywhere but around
<BR>
and around. There doesn't seem to be anything that everyone can agree on.
<BR>
Too many variables, I guess.
<BR>
