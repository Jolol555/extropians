<P>
FYI
<BR>
<P>First private Space Station OPENS next Week.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Dear Foundationers and fighters for the Frontier,
<BR>
<P>Next Wed. at 10:30 PST (current estimate) history will take another step 
<BR>
along the path we are blazing.
<BR>
<P>At that moment, the first two human beings to enter space without government 
<BR>
funding will open the hatch and enter the world's first commercial space 
<BR>
station.
<BR>
<P>This is YOUR victory, and you should start right now, today, telling the 
<BR>
world and those around you how it happened, and what it means.
<BR>
<P>The Foundation and our fellow Frontier Movement organizations should grab 
<BR>
this opportunity and get the word out. 
<BR>
<P>Don't be mislead by discussions of ISS or the fact that they will be 
<BR>
Russians. The mess ISS is in goes well beyond any bad deals NASA cut with 
<BR>
their team members....and where these employees live is irrelevant, they are 
<BR>
humans, and they will be working for a company founded on the core principles 
<BR>
of our cause.
<BR>
<P>At that time or shortly thereafter, we will be declaring victory in our Keep 
<BR>
Mir Alive Campaign, closing the formal WEBsite and beginning the next phase 
<BR>
of our battle to create Alpha Town - the first human community in space - the 
<BR>
hand off from NASA of the ISS to the private sector. 
<BR>
<P>Poss. slogan - We have privatized the former Soviet space station, now it is 
<BR>
time to privatize our own...)
<BR>
<P>Our push will be to force the creation of a National Commission to recommend 
<BR>
how the ISS can be turned over to a non-governmental entity to act as 
<BR>
landlord and manager of the facility. (Interestingly, this will help free 
<BR>
NASA up from doing a job it wasn't designed to do and is killing the agency, 
<BR>
to prep for Mars...if the next Pres. should choose to do so...)
<BR>
<P>This event needs you to amplify and explain it, for if we don't, others who 
<BR>
do not share nor comprehend our vision will. Please, begin today writing 
<BR>
OpEds, letters to editors, offering to speak to local radio and media, and 
<BR>
sending letters etc. to your representatives in Congress etc... letting them 
<BR>
know it is the dawn of a new era in space. If you feel unable to go public 
<BR>
yourself, create the opportunity and call our office at 818-985-7781, we will 
<BR>
supply the spokesperson.
<BR>
<P>The momentum created by this project is ours to use or lose. MirCorp may 
<BR>
succeed or fail based on business criteria which are none of our concern, but 
<BR>
we must not let them fail based on misunderstanding and negative PR generated 
<BR>
by those who still think they hold the keys to space. It would be a tragedy, 
<BR>
if other concerns or fear of controversy caused us to hesitate when we have 
<BR>
produced one of the biggest breakthroughs in the history of our movement. 
<BR>
<P>Your fellow members of the Frontier Movement have put their lives, money and 
<BR>
reputations on the line as they have charged ahead into the cannons of the 
<BR>
establishment.
<BR>
<P>Back them up, and we can win the future.
<BR>
<P>Join us.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Rick Tumlinson
<BR>
President, The Space Frontier Foundation
<BR>
Exec. Director, F.I.N.D.S.
<BR>
<P>PS - Some of you may recall a little pirate flag that has waved over our 
<BR>
offices for years and I occaisionally unfurl during speeches....also 
<BR>
allusions to such privateering concepts I have made over time....that flag is 
<BR>
on its way to Russia as I write this, to be flown aboard Mir...
