<EM>&gt; &gt; By the way, neurons are slow and neurotransmitters are super slow, even

<EM>&gt; &gt; today a transistor is several hundred million times faster.

<EM>&gt; [Re: Moravec &amp; neurotransmitters/hormones]:  Its not that he questions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its role, he never considers it in the first place.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the Moravec's perspective, this is a correct approach.  In his
</EM><BR>
thinking, which is a &quot;systems&quot; approach, he would not care for example
<BR>
how much of the processing power was in &quot;directly&quot; executed instructions
<BR>
and how much of the processing power was done in &quot;indirectly&quot; executed
<BR>
(microcoded/virtual) instructions.  All he cares about is what the
<BR>
function is that those instructions *do* and how much processing
<BR>
power he needs to do it on alternate software/firmware/hardware.
<BR>
In this situation, it is even &quot;wrong&quot; to use the &quot;instructions per second&quot;
<BR>
measure as that really only applies to common computer architectures.
<BR>
Moravec's vision software could be recoded and run on a cellular automata
<BR>
or pushed down to the hardware level (as the vision chip engineer's
<BR>
appear to have done).  In both cases applying a &quot;MIPs&quot; measure is
<BR>
a questionable thing to do.
<BR>
<P>In the brain its done with neurons and neurotransmitters and hormones,
<BR>
in the cellular automata its done via massively parrallel data passing
<BR>
with a little computation, in the hardware gate arrays its done with
<BR>
networks of electrical circuits.  The point isn't how many MIPs are
<BR>
involved but &quot;What does it do?&quot; and &quot;What is the most efficient way
<BR>
to do that?&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I'd add in passing, that regarding Robin's comments that this may get
<BR>
better indefinately, that at some point we have to hit some limits.
<BR>
I would expect that for each type of thing the brain does, for example
<BR>
&quot;edge recognition&quot; in vision systems, or &quot;pattern extraction&quot; in hearing
<BR>
systems there should be an &quot;optimal&quot; architecture given the physical
<BR>
structure of this universe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My entire concern is ultimately in regards to uploading my consciousness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and to the necessary computational *complexity* required to assure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no parts of cognition, no matter how subtle, are ignored due to ignoring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the role of computation within the neuron itself.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is clearly stated.   This is what I refered to as the &quot;bottom-up&quot;
<BR>
problem.  When you don't know what the neural net is *really* doing,
<BR>
you are going to have to simulate it.  An accurate simulation is going to
<BR>
require a number of things, including the neurtransmitter/hormone effects.
<BR>
As Anders pointed out, there are clever things that neurophysiologists
<BR>
can abstract and assume to make neuron simulations tractable using currently
<BR>
available software and hardware.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since Hans has based all the estimates I've seen only on the neural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network nodes themselves, I've been urging that we also take into account
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the computational processes taking place within those nodes (neurons).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why has almost everybody missed this point?
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe this is where you may be tripping up.  Hans says *nothing*
<BR>
about the computational capacity of the brain (neurons with or without
<BR>
neurotransmitters &amp; hormones).  Hans *only* says things about the MIPS
<BR>
requirements on common computer architectures that are required to
<BR>
*do* what the combination of things in parts of the brain *does*.
<BR>
<P>The MIPS requirements that you are looking for (accurate simulations of
<BR>
physiological (realistic) neural networks) are *entirely* unrelated to
<BR>
the MIPS requirements discussed by Moravec.  My suspicion is that the
<BR>
work being done by deGaris on the artificial brain is closer to what
<BR>
you need, since his chips are designed to emulate at least aspects
<BR>
of the neural network, though at a much higher rate.  If those chips
<BR>
have inputs that allow for things like &quot;ease of excitability&quot; which
<BR>
would be related to the states influenced by past neurotransmitters
<BR>
and hormones in the brain, then deGaris has a pretty realistic simulator
<BR>
and the question becomes simply one of when the #-of-neuron-circuits
<BR>
times the rate-of-neuron-ops exceeds the equivalent capacity in the brain.
<BR>
<P>The figure of merit that you should use (to avoid this kind of confusion)
<BR>
is something like NOpS (neural operations per second) where NOpS would
<BR>
be divided into an aritmetic component (the multiply/add function I
<BR>
previously mention) and perhaps some memory/minor-computational
<BR>
component (the neurotransmitters &amp; hormones) that effectively change
<BR>
the state of the neuron and/or function as minor information carriers
<BR>
(where the major information carrier is the architecture of the network
<BR>
itself).
<BR>
<P>Current computer architectures are entirely unsuitable for providing NOpS.
<BR>
The coming processor-in-memory architectures and &quot;Blue-Gene&quot; from IBM
<BR>
will be much closer to what is needed.  With the right instruction
<BR>
sets, they should be several orders of magnitude faster than conventional
<BR>
computers at providing us with NOpS.
