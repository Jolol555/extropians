Phil says:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Is it possible that one of the reasons for the apparent extended 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;youthfulness, etc., exhibited in the recent calve clones or some of the cell 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;culture experiments is due to the fact that the stable environment, with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only cells of the same kind present, made for a much stronger reinforcement 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;signal pattern to the cells of each generation?  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thus, the normal correction procedures that keep a cell on track might use 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that unambiguous signal as a referent, and actually clean up a lot of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accumulated error.
</EM><BR>
<P>I rather doubt it, since this felicitous and constrained in vitro
<BR>
environment should also benefit all the classic cell experiments that hit
<BR>
their usual Hayflick limit. This lot did way better.
<BR>
<P>Robert Bradbury raised the question earlier in this thread as to whether
<BR>
the telomerase gene goes inappropriately active before or after the
<BR>
accidents to genetic brakes and accelerators that permit cells to go
<BR>
cancerous. My guess is that most often it's switched onprior to the other
<BR>
events (by chance accident, not as part of a designed sequence). Turning on
<BR>
runaway growth factors and switching off inhibitors and apoptotic systems
<BR>
etc (again by chance) will get a tumor started, but telomere erosion will
<BR>
stop it fairly soon. If the tumor mass is comparatively small, and the
<BR>
number of remaining normal cell divisions only 50 or fewer, there's not all
<BR>
that much opportunity for a chance mutation to activate a dormant
<BR>
telomerase gene in the cell clone. But switch it on early and the immortal
<BR>
cell clone can accumulate mutations for as long as takes to gather the
<BR>
other four or five master-code errors needed to make it into a monster.
<BR>
<P>I have no empirical evidence for this assessment, however.
