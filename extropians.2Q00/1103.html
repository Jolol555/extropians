<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Don't get me wrong, I'm no big fan of the welfare state.  I work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hard for my living 5 (sometimes 6, sometimes 7) days a week.  I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certainly not looking for big brother to give me or my family any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;handouts and I would probably benefit as much as anybody else from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a nice fat tax cut.  But I think there is a middle road between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the ad infinitum welfare state and the immediate end of the dole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(which is what would lead to the &quot;casualties&quot; you seem to so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;easily dismiss).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I think its obvious that there needs to be a nice plump carrot, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well as a nice thick stick.  Telling people that &quot;the good ol'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;welfare days are over, see ya later and rotsa ruck&quot; is just going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to create a huge drain on society that will be good for nobody. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I for one am not going to sit still and watch American kids
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;starving in the streets.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You want to end welfare?  OK, so do I.  But you have to give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people the means with which to make their own way in the world. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If I'm ignorant, poor, uneducated and unskilled and you kick me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and my kids out into the streets to starve, you have de facto
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;turned me into a criminal.  I will rob everyone in sight.  I will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;soon be caught and put in jail then, guess what?  Free room 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and board on your dime again.  Nice solution.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem with medicine is that even when it's good for you, it
<BR>
tastes lousy. In fact the better the medicine, the worse the taste.
<BR>
<P>Welfare was a well meaning attempt to correct a problem, but we
<BR>
created an even worse problem with the solution.
<BR>
<P>Welfare wasn't cut off immediately, they gave a 2 year notice.
<BR>
There are job programs, and other kinds of assistance, but lets
<BR>
admit it, it's going to be a tough road, as it should be.
<BR>
<P>Handout days are over.
<BR>
<P>Thomas Stanley points out in &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; that this
<BR>
exact same phenomenon occurs among the wealthy when they give
<BR>
handouts to their own descendants. Those who receive &quot;Economic
<BR>
Outpatient Care&quot; from their elders earn less then their
<BR>
professional peers (even doctors and lawyers), and have a much
<BR>
lower net worth.
<BR>
<P>People are responsible for their own selves and their children. It
<BR>
may sound harsh, but here it is: people shouldn't have children
<BR>
they can't afford, and these days children are very expensive.
<BR>
<P>I don't intend to let children starve either, but their parents
<BR>
(yes PARENTS, every child starts out with two.) will have to
<BR>
struggle extremely hard for every nickel they get from me. They
<BR>
will find it much easier (and rewarding) to get a job.
