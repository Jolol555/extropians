<EM> &gt; &gt; &gt;Politeness is a disease I have no use for[...]
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;My $0.02: though I agree with almost all of your post (i.e.: addressing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;ideas, not people; responding to issues objectively etc.) I personally 
</EM><BR>
find
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;no reason *not* to be polite.  I can't think of any conversations or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;correspondances I have had which have suffered as a result of inherent
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;politeness.  Come to think of it, most correspondances have been 
</EM><BR>
enhanced
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;by politeness, in my opinion; (but that *is*, after all, just my
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;opinion...criticize at will).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I think I can see Lee's point.  Politeness can be somewhat
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; inefficient(having to type superfluous characters such as &quot;please&quot; and 
</EM><BR>
other
<BR>
<EM> &gt; magick words).  But since our conversations are still limited to other
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; humans (with all their bothersome emotions and other quirks) I think
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; politeness is a worthwhile tool for enhancing human-human communications.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The programmers on the list may be used to impolitely ordering computers
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; around with no negative result, but as Stephen Covey likes to say, while
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;efficiency&quot; may work best with *things* it is &quot;effectiveness&quot; (which
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; includes such niceties as courtesy and politeness) which works best with
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; *people*.
</EM><BR>
<P>Lack of politeness is useful in venues where all participants do not
<BR>
value politeness, even then its rather easy for people who emotionally
<BR>
vested to get their danders up in a fluff. Outside of that, it degrades
<BR>
efficiency because some people who feel put upon and others who aren't
<BR>
considerate enough to consider how others might feel to have themselves
<BR>
or other denigrated will wind up wasting bandwidth talking past each
<BR>
other's blind spots. Then you also get wasted bandwidth from people
<BR>
discussing rudeness vs. politeness....
<BR>
<P>On the flip side a benefit of rudeness, at least among intelligent and
<BR>
rational participants in a discussion, should serve to notify the target
<BR>
of rudeness that someone they otherwise respect has serious issues with
<BR>
your statements. Best to check your assumptions. It should be recognised
<BR>
that there is a vast difference between calling an idea stupid and
<BR>
calling the other participant stupid. However a person should not simply
<BR>
sau such a thing, they should provide credible refutation as to why an
<BR>
idea is stupid.
<BR>
<P>Its rather simple: politeness is social lubricant. Complaining about
<BR>
typing a few more characters for words like 'please' etc. is a cop out,
<BR>
since such terms are much abbreviated from the old forms of 'wherefore
<BR>
art thou's', 'where to for's', 'if it pleaseth thou's, etc...
<BR>
<P>Making efficiency of word utilizaiton the only important part of a
<BR>
debate of conversation will reduce us to merely grunting primates that
<BR>
whack each other when one's growl is not properly interpreted.
