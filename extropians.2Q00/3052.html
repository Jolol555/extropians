<P>I disagree strongly with this as I've said in another post.  Our *current*
<BR>
sensing technology is more than sufficient to detect very small hot spots.
<BR>
(I'm sure Spike could comment here.)  If there is reason to suspect
<BR>
covert activities, we could easily launch equivalents of the Space

Infrared Telescope and turn them around to study earth.  It goes without
<BR>
saying that we are not even completely aware of the sophistication
<BR>
of our existing detection capabilities.  Considering the rapid
<BR>
progress in photon detectors (i.e. astronomers couldn't buy for

any price a 3 million pixel CCD 10 years ago, and now we have them

in consumer devices), I have little doubt that our detection capabilities
<BR>
will be up to the task.
<BR>
<P>With sufficient monitoring capacity we would know the *day* anyone
<BR>
released badbots on the planet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; There seems to be a fundamental mismatch between the sophistication of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the goodbots, who run an active immune system that checks every cell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on the planet, and the badbots, who can't manage to operate even as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; efficiently as green plants.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really, look at your own immune system, running around checking
<BR>
the state of all the cells in your body.  They are usually able to
<BR>
police the neighborhood fairly effectively and only consume several
<BR>
percent of the resources available to you.
<BR>
<P>It isn't that bad bots (or good bots) will not be able to operate
<BR>
more efficiently than plants, it is that it will take a very long
<BR>
time to develop such efficient machines *and* to operate much
<BR>
more efficiently, they need to operate *slower* than plants.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (1)  Nanoweaponry fighting it out on the nanoscale arrives relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; late in the game; in real life, the first two &quot;nanoweapons&quot; to have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; military impact would be diamondoid jet fighters and the like,
</EM><BR>
<P>I see no significant advantages to &quot;diamondoid jet fighters&quot;.
<BR>
You can lighten the airframe somewhat but you still have to
<BR>
have many components that cannot be made out of diamond because
<BR>
it cannot withstand the high temperatures (engine turbine blades
<BR>
for example).  Everyone seems to think nanotech is &quot;indestructable&quot;
<BR>
and that simply is not true.  So diamond is 10x stronger than steel,
<BR>
that just means your missles have to have 10x larger expolosive
<BR>
yield to produce equivalent damage to a diamondoid jet vs. a steel jet.
<BR>
<P>The U.S. already makes the best jets in the world, with some competition
<BR>
from the Russians.  So what is the point of funding large efforts
<BR>
to make nanotech jets?  Given the computational capacity that nanotech
<BR>
will allow you to put into missiles, I question whether jets are
<BR>
viable weapons *at all* in a nanotech era.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; followed by saturation launches of vat-grown nuclear weapons.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem with nuclear weapons is you *still* need the uranium.
<BR>
Robert has told me that Gina has a copy of a paper he did that says
<BR>
&quot;mining&quot; gold using nanotech may be prohibitively expensive.
<BR>
Mining uranium may be even worse.
<BR>
<P>To grow nuclear weapons you are going need (a) fuel and (b)
<BR>
rad-hardened nanotech.  I seem to recall that during the
<BR>
development of the A-bomb we lost at least one scientist
<BR>
at Los Alamos because he picked up a hunk of plutonium to
<BR>
prevent an accident.  What makes you think nanotech can
<BR>
work in that environment?  Nuclear fission works by
<BR>
the release of neutrons, a kg of fissionable material
<BR>
releases a lot of neutrons and doesn't matter *what*
<BR>
the nearby material is, it is going to sustain damage.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We'd have to get through that without blowing ourselves up before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we'd get the chance to dust the biosphere.
</EM><BR>
<P>We have enough nuclear and bioweapons today to blow ourselves up
<BR>
and we aren't doing it.  You *MUST* make a credible situation
<BR>
that someone will (a) get nanotech before anyone else; (b)
<BR>
use it to develop advanced weapons; (c) grow such large quantities
<BR>
of those weapons and train people to operate them (or create
<BR>
&quot;intelligent&quot; weapons) that they represent a threat; (d) do it all
<BR>
without anyone realizing what is going on.  Then after you have
<BR>
met *all* of those critera, you have to present a case that
<BR>
the threat would be so large and present itself so fast that
<BR>
conventional weapons and tactics would be useless against it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even if Freitas's paper is entirely true in every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detail, it doesn't mean - as a policy conclusion - that there's a safe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; path to nanotechnology.
</EM><BR>
<P>But it is a first attempt to show that all of the &quot;crying wolf&quot;
<BR>
that people do *may* be crying at shadows on the wall rather than
<BR>
real wolves.  You can't *prove* that we aren't going to be turned
<BR>
into dust tomorrow by an asteroid we didn't see.  All you can do
<BR>
is make reasonable estimates that its highly unlikely to occur.
<BR>
That is about the best we can do with nanotech as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (2)  The battle strategies depicted here aren't twisted enough to depict
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a real-life arms race.  Would military replibots really wait around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; passively to be swept up into neat little nets?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, but if you are busy avoiding being swept up that is likely to
<BR>
put a significant restriction on reproductive efforts.  The nets
<BR>
could simple herd the bad-bots into an area where they exhaust the
<BR>
resources and as a result are forced to stop replicating.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If sentrybots in the human body can detect replibots, can't the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replibots detect the sentrybots and hide?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, &quot;detection&quot; in bio/nanoworlds &quot;usually&quot; involves touching
<BR>
the enemy (unless the badbots are stupid enough to broadcast their
<BR>
presence).  Acoustic sonar may also be possible.  So the likely
<BR>
situation is the good and bad bots detect each other simultaneously.
<BR>
However, the goodbot can broadcast a signal that rapidly recruits more
<BR>
goodbots while the badbot may only have limited reinforcement available.
<BR>
Its *entirely* a numbers game *just* as it is now with bacteria.
<BR>
If I inject you with a cc of streptococcus, you are in *big* trouble.
<BR>
However if I inject you with one streptococcus, the likelyhood of it
<BR>
replicating much before your immune system takes it out is very low.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [snip] and can scan or alter every byte of RAM; are we really supposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to win a cracker's war in physical reality?
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends how important it is to you.  We don't have good computer
<BR>
security now because it is too much trouble for humans to remember
<BR>
3 passwords.  However we do have retina and fingerprint recognition
<BR>
devices coming that will make it *very* hard to gain improper access.
<BR>
<P>The *reason* most medical procedures are so expensive is that
<BR>
you have to do almost everything possible to avoid killing the
<BR>
patient.  Most computer systems can't &quot;kill&quot; their users and so
<BR>
security failures are tolerated.  When computers can kill their
<BR>
users, failures won't be acceptable.  The reason it took computers
<BR>
so long to get into automobiles is that the automakers didn't
<BR>
trust them to be reliable enough not to kill someone.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (3)  Assuming that a single radiation strike produces device failure is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conservative when arguing a proof-of-possibility that nanomachines can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be constructed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can solve this very simply.  Researchers at Berkeley discuss
<BR>
a high energy cesium ion source that can deliver 0.4 Amps of
<BR>
ions in 0.37 microsecond pulses (delivering 400 trillion watts).
<BR>
Any nanotech in this beam is converted to *slag*.  If you think
<BR>
nanotech has active electrostatic or magnetic defenses, you just
<BR>
convert the beam to neutrons as is done in the Berkeley
<BR>
Rotating Neutron Source.
<BR>
See:

<BR>
<P>If you don't like those methods, you can hit them with a propane torch
<BR>
that should reach temperatures where diamond begins to oxidize and
<BR>
burn at 870-1070K (Nanomedicine, pg 296).  If you want to kill the
<BR>
badbots faster, buy yourself a hotter flame, e.g.:
<BR>
Oxy-propane     4579F
<BR>
Oxy-NG          4600F
<BR>
Oxy-propylene   5240F
<BR>
Oxy-MAPP        5301F
<BR>
Oxy-acetylene   5720F
<BR>
<P>All of these are above the melting point of diamond in a non-oxygen
<BR>
atmosphere of ~1800k (2780F).
<BR>
<P>And finally, if you want to be a little clever about it, you could
<BR>
lure those little badbots between a couple of electrodes with a nice
<BR>
carbon-rich snack and then zap them with enough voltage to disrupt
<BR>
all of the bonds in their precious little bodies...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (Has anyone tried running simulations of the effect of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; radiation errors on atomically detailed designs, e.g. the Parts list at IMM?)
</EM><BR>
<P>I know of nobody who has tried this.  I've been talking about it
<BR>
for a couple of years because I want the data to determine probable
<BR>
lifetimes for space-probe-bots.  The code does exist at LLNL and the
<BR>
other defense labs to run the simulations at the atomic level.
<BR>
However I'm unsure what would be required to get access to it for
<BR>
testing nanodesign radiation hardness.
<BR>
<P>However, you can make some estimates based on bio-sterilization
<BR>
procedures.  Standard food sterilization has to &quot;guarantee&quot; there
<BR>
are no microbes capable of reproducing once the procedure is complete.
<BR>
To do this they drop the foods in a tank and expose it to a hefty
<BR>
radiation dose, presumably high enough to guarantee several double
<BR>
strand breaks in the chromosomes of any bacteria in the food.
<BR>
So a moderately safe nanoshield would consist of a couple of
<BR>
lead walls filled with some cobolt-60 (or equivalently strong
<BR>
radiation source) buckshot.  Since we are on the topic, I'll
<BR>
ask Robert what the &quot;minimal&quot; wall design is that maximizes human
<BR>
safety inside the walls but is guaranteed to sterilize nanobots
<BR>
that try to come through it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why call attention to ourselves now, risking a media brouhaha and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ban on all nanotechnology?
</EM><BR>
<P>A ban will not work.  You can't regulate small technologies that
<BR>
can be constructed from relatively abundant materials.  How do
<BR>
you ban AFM construction?  Ok, lets regulate the sale of all
<BR>
peizoelectric crystals.  Hmmm, doesn't that mean I have to ban
<BR>
the sale of all elements from which those crystals can be grown?
<BR>
Right!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; By the time global ecophagy is a real threat, everyone will have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screaming about diamondoid fighter jets for the last year, and there'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be moratoriums all over the place.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why?  If the nations of the free world see this coming, the probability
<BR>
will be that they all will have diamondoid fighter jets within a few
<BR>
years of each other.  You don't think the EU or China or Russia is
<BR>
going to sit by twidling their thumbs while the U.S. develops
<BR>
this technology do you?  Technology is technology, the economic
<BR>
advantages benefits of the technology used &quot;properly&quot; are very
<BR>
clear, so the development is likely to occur at relatively similar
<BR>
rates around the world (in the more developed nations).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A non-governmental-organization (i.e. Foresight) publishing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voluntary guidelines is good enough for the immediate memetic effect,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too; you just say, in a heavy, serious tone of voice:  &quot;The Foresight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Guidelines explicitly prohibit the development of replicators which can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operate in a biological environment; furthermore, the Foresight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Guidelines require that even vat replicators use a broadcast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architecture...&quot; and so on.
</EM><BR>
<P>You want to go further than that, you want to make people aware that
<BR>
it is a serious problem, but one that can be defended against with
<BR>
a safety level that corresponds to your investment in sensors and
<BR>
defensive devices.  Wouldn't it be better to put into place (legally,
<BR>
on a global basis) things like the NIH guidelines that work to prevent
<BR>
accidents or the bio/chemical weapons treaties that managed to begin
<BR>
putting the bad-genies back into the bottle shortly after it got out.
<BR>
<P>You want to say -- &quot;Look, here are the good things and here are the
<BR>
bad things.  If we can work together we could perhaps avoid wasting
<BR>
too many resources on dealing with the bad things.&quot;  For example,
<BR>
how about entirely open-source defensive designs developed by
<BR>
international teams?
