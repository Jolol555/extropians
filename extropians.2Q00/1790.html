<P>
Mike,
<BR>
<P>First of all, I suppose I've got to apologise for the tone of my post.
<BR>
Looking at it in retrospect, it's a load of foaming rant. Bit of a habit
<BR>
with me, this kind of thing - I'm going to have to lay off the coffee a bit.
<BR>
However, somewhere in the foaming rant there be wisdom.....
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;Rob, I'm quite familiar with the situation. Don't think for a minute that I
</EM><BR>
think
<BR>
<EM> &gt;the IRA or the pIRA should be considered legitimate politicians. They are
</EM><BR>
hardly
<BR>
<EM> &gt;'republican' (unless you are talking about People's Republics).
</EM><BR>
<P>I call them 'republican', as this is what they call themselves - hence Irish
<BR>
Republican Army (IRA)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;However the level
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to which you and others demonize them would hardly make an IRA member very
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;trusting that you didn't have it in for him,
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, I and a great many others want everyone affiliated to the IRA  D E A D,
<BR>
and I make no apologies.
<BR>
There have been far too many bombs in public places where nobody is even
<BR>
slightly concerned with the colour of the NI flag. As I mentioned before,
<BR>
kids have been blown away for this &quot;cause&quot;, and it's this failure to put the
<BR>
reality of the situation into perspective that angers me, nothing more.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;because he 'knows' that what you say
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;about him isn't true, so far as he is concerned.
</EM><BR>
<P>No. The IRA strangely always seem to take responsibility for their terrorist
<BR>
actions. And noone denies anything, particularly Gerry Adams, who likes to
<BR>
threaten reimplementation of the IRA when he is backed into a corner during
<BR>
political debate.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;I've found that this is a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;typical british argument while sipping their tea, &quot;:oh, we're the civilized
</EM><BR>
ones,
<BR>
<EM> &gt;THEY are just utter barbarians...&quot; that kind of thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely. And I know you yanks love more than anyone a bit of
<BR>
holier-than-thou action, but I think that if you can't label the IRA
<BR>
barbarians, then I guess Hitler and Genghis Khan were great guys too.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;Condescension and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;alternately, vilification, gets you nowhere.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wasn't trying to &quot;get somewhere&quot;, I was putting the discussion here on a
<BR>
track closer to the reality of the situation. Anger and utter contempt for
<BR>
the republican motives is widespread, and not just in my head - far from it.
<BR>
Most reasonable people lose all sympathy for a cause once bombing kids
<BR>
becomes the tactic of the day.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;Actually, until recently it was written into the Eire constitution, and its
</EM><BR>
part
<BR>
<EM> &gt;of the IRA and Sinn Fein 'platform', that rejoining Eire was the ultimate
</EM><BR>
goal,
<BR>
<EM> &gt;so I don't understand what you are basing this claim on.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wasn't talking about then, I was talking about now. Countering the comment
<BR>
that the whole goal was an end to an enforced splitting of Eire. I have also
<BR>
never heard of what you describe above, despite hearing about the NI problem
<BR>
mostly every day for most of my life. Perhaps Adams used this as Yank
<BR>
propaganda, I don't know, but I've certainly never heard this once. There
<BR>
would be no problem if the British government called the shots. They have
<BR>
wanted rid of this problem for decades.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;Great evacuate them, if they are British. If they are Irish, let them stay.
</EM><BR>
<P>For Christ's sake !!! They're ALL British, and Irish - they're citizens of
<BR>
British Northern Ireland. One more time - there IS NO British/Irish
<BR>
dichotomy in Northern Ireland. This is a solely American misconception
<BR>
almost certainly born of Adams and his fundraising activities. They are all
<BR>
Northern Irish which currently comes under the &quot;British&quot; umbrella. Neither
<BR>
faction is affiliated to either Eire or England.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;Fine way to develop trust Rob.
</EM><BR>
<P>Trust? Excuse my French, but what the fuck are you on about? How is NI
<BR>
republican trust of the English populace an issue?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;Fine fine strategy. Let me give you a lesson on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;terrorism: Terrorists do what they do for very rational, very logical
</EM><BR>
reasons.
<BR>
<EM> &gt;What they do may be horrific, but everything they do is always for very
</EM><BR>
good
<BR>
<EM> &gt;reasons, from their point of view.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah. Gaining control of NI.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;The point of terrorism is to get the other
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;side to appreciate that the oppressed may really have good reasons, by
</EM><BR>
giving
<BR>
<EM> &gt;them a concentrated dose of their own medicine.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no oppression except the republican kneecap rule.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;The fact you keep ranting on in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;such virulent terms shows me that YOU haven't learned this lesson yet. If
</EM><BR>
most
<BR>
<EM> &gt;british are like you, I predict that the violence will continue on for
</EM><BR>
quite a
<BR>
<EM> &gt;while more....
</EM><BR>
<P>The opinions of the British populace are irrelevant. There is nothing the
<BR>
British people can do to affect this situation in any way. Except get blown
<BR>
up. Even the government are virtually hopeless these days, and they've been
<BR>
accommodating as hell - they even brought in some Yank to negotiate
<BR>
recently, as they thought the republicans might respond better to what they
<BR>
perceive as a friendly mediator.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;Considering that the level of violence in even the worst areas of NI is
</EM><BR>
nowhere
<BR>
<EM> &gt;near the levels of violence in peaceful Boston, MA, you can hardly expect
</EM><BR>
me to
<BR>
<EM> &gt;agree with you...sounds to me like a drama queen at work...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah. Drama. Well, your agreement is irrelevant, your opinion is irrelevant
<BR>
and your information is, well, simply false.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;Its always easier to get away with oppression when nobody thinks that you
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM> &gt;really capable of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>What oppression? How? Examples? Even Sinn Fein don't make such pretensions.
<BR>
Not in the UK anyway. You're simply making this up.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;Which just indicates the the propaganda may be working, and the british
</EM><BR>
have been
<BR>
<EM> &gt;able to avoid any fuckups for a sufficient amount of time. The SAS threw in
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM> &gt;towel. They concluded there were at best 300 active IRA people committing
</EM><BR>
most if
<BR>
<EM> &gt;not all violent acts, and they couldn't take them down. With one of the
</EM><BR>
tightest
<BR>
<EM> &gt;gun control laws in the world, the SAS couldn't outgun the IRA. With one of
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM> &gt;most absolute policies abdicating the human rights of the accused (and the
</EM><BR>
Laws
<BR>
<EM> &gt;of War for that matter, depending on which way you want to take the
</EM><BR>
argument),
<BR>
<EM> &gt;they couldn't hunt down and erase even a fraction of the enemy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Where the shite did you get this crap from? You're just making it up, aren't
<BR>
you?
<BR>
There was no such clash between the SAS and IRA, there was certainly no
<BR>
gunfight (ROFL).
<BR>
British military intelligence disclosed that they had a complete list of all
<BR>
members and their addresses, even their school records at the time of the
<BR>
shoot to kill uproar, probably hoping to gain public support for some kind
<BR>
of systematic cleanup policy, but the Gibraltar affair put an end to all
<BR>
that. The SAS were never put on a cleanup mission, and they do not do their
<BR>
own intelligence. They are a oft-proven crack antiterrorist squad, so if
<BR>
they'd been put on a clearance mission, there would be no problem with the
<BR>
IRA now.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;If you are so sick to the back of the teeth about it, then quit.
</EM><BR>
<P>Quit what? life? What are you talking about?
<BR>
<P>Rob.
<BR>
<P>PS Jeez - I'm going to have to start smoking again!
<BR>
