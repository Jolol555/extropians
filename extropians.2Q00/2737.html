<EM>&gt; How is being a 'ubiquitous surveillance fanatic' (which Mr Zero has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; admitted to being) not equal to advocating that everyone reveal their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; address, as well as all sorts of other personal, private information,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over the internet?
</EM><BR>
<P>I still think you are &quot;equating&quot; what Zero said to something you think is
<BR>
similar, and then attacking your &quot;equivalence&quot; of what he said, not what he
<BR>
actually said.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Actually, Harvey, I asked him first, so don't feel responsible on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; account. I will stop attacking him, though, because it seems that there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are plenty of other people on the list who have come to the conclusion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that he or his idea is full of it, too, that surveillance is not what he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would like it to be.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks.  Just for the record:  I think Zero can take care of himself.  I was
<BR>
more worried about what newcomers would think of your behavior.  And even
<BR>
while I was defending Zero's rights to speak or not speak what he wanted, I
<BR>
do agree that his ideas are threatening and bogus.  My whole career is based
<BR>
on keeping secrets, and I make a hell of a lot of money doing it.  I have
<BR>
personal secrets, family secrets, client secrets, industrial secrets,
<BR>
military secrets, and national security secrets that I don't want to be made
<BR>
public.
