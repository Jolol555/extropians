<EM>&gt; &gt; For my own perverse needs, I am seeing if any of the members of this list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; conform to  my idea of the accusation in question.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, this perplexed bystander has a comment.  Why was Brian subjected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a rather snotty remark from somebody who said something along the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lines of &quot;You, sir, have insulted the love of my life and I won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stand for it!&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seems to me that if a female stands up and slings mud then she, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same as you, me, or anyone else, runs the risk of getting whacked.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For other persons to then say, &quot;Now you apologize to the little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lady,&quot; exhibits rather crude sexism in my view.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good for you. Some of us feel that for a husband to NOT stand up for his
<BR>
wife is a sign of worse personal defects than mere sexism. And for the
<BR>
record, it was Brian who made the original, rather insulting aspersions
<BR>
as to Natashas personal life. I would have been surprised quite a bit if
<BR>
both had not become quite enraged as to such stupendous effrontery and
<BR>
obliviousness.
<BR>
<P>Since Natasha is in no way little, based on the pictures I've seen of
<BR>
her, saying &quot;apologize to the little lady&quot; would not be an accurate
<BR>
statement to make, however she is a lady, and she does deserve an
<BR>
apology.
