<EM>&gt; A VR can never be the environment of anything in a thermodynamic sense. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't even be the environment of a purely virtual device. All the bits in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your robot are represented by real bits in a physical computer. So are all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the bits representing the current state of the VR, and its past and future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; states. When you try to reverse the virtual operations of your simulated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robot, it is this mass of physical bits that must be manipulated. In order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to return the VR world to a previous state, you have to return some pattern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of bits in the physical machine back to a previous state. At that point you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run into exactly the same constraints you would have if you weren't using a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VR.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you don't run into the same constraints.  The reason is that in
<BR>
the case of the VR, the bits which must be reversed are all bits in
<BR>
your computer.  You had complete control over the design of this system
<BR>
and you can arrange for the system to be reversible.
<BR>
<P>In the case of a robot interacting with the real world of grass and trees
<BR>
and rocks, those systems are not reversible.  They contain dynamics which
<BR>
increase entropy and prevent reversibility.
<BR>
<P>You can reverse simulated grass, simulated trees, simulated rocks,
<BR>
and their interactions with a simulated robot in a virtual reality.
<BR>
This is a special case of creating a reversible computer.  But you cannot
<BR>
reverse real world systems.  That is the fundamental difference.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is just a special case of a much more general (and obvious) rule: no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; form of software can ever perform a computation that could not, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; principle, be done by the hardware it runs on.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's not what we're talking about doing.  We are asking whether a robot
<BR>
in a virtual reality which interacts with a simulated environment Could
<BR>
use less energy than a robot could which interacts with physical reality.
<BR>
I refer you back to our earlier exchange:
<BR>
<P>: &gt; &gt; For example if you want to minimize energy costs in running your brain,
<BR>
: &gt; &gt; you have two choices: live in the real world with an artificial brain,
<BR>
: &gt; &gt; or live in a VR.  The latter gives you more opportunities to save energy,
<BR>
: &gt; &gt; because for example you can reverse time for the entire world in order
<BR>
: &gt; &gt; to undo some reversible calculations.
<BR>
: &gt;
<BR>
: &gt; Now we're going back to the same idea you ruled out in your first paragraph.
<BR>
: &gt; If a mind is implemented in software you already have complete control over
<BR>
: &gt; its 'reality'. There is nothing you can do by putting it in a VR that you
<BR>
: &gt; couldn't just do directly. There may be advantages of convenience or
<BR>
: &gt; flexibility in the VR approach, but a more direct implementation of any
<BR>
: &gt; given trick will always run faster and cost less energy.
<BR>
: 
<BR>
: If you're living in the real world, you're interacting with the real world.
<BR>
: You can't rewind the real world.
<BR>
: 
<BR>
: If you're living in a virtual world, you're interacting with the virtual
<BR>
: world.  You can rewind the virtual world and this gives you opportunities
<BR>
: to save energy.  That's the difference.
