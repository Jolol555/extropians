<EM>&gt; &gt;Of course, for those who feel this is far too compromising, there will in

<EM>&gt; &gt;the future the option to go to the oceans or also outer space to found the

<EM>&gt; &gt;wish you all luck and in time may join you, but for now please understand

<EM>&gt; &gt;if I feel pride and a touch of emotion when I see the American flag waving

<EM>&gt; &gt;in the wind.

<EM>&gt; John, I think it's ok to be patriotic, obviously the secret is moderation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm also proud of my country, customs and culture, and I think patriotism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is basic in my nation so we can get rid of  corrupt, murderous and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power-hungry governments. that describes exactly how our goverment is, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my case being a patriotic mexican, I want democracy, civil liberties and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legal system that gives us better human rights, so I actually think that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moderate patriotism isn't that bad, although I'd still love to see our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entire continent united like a single nation, respecting the cultural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; differences and customs of each country, although we are still far from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, however I predict that if we get rid of the pri, and our economy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becomes as competitive as it should be our level of cooperation with our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothern and southern neighboors won't have precedents.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There have been already talks about entering to a second phase in the nafta
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that allows free migration of workers and profesionals among our countries,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think something like that would be great not just for mexico, but to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; states and canada as well
</EM><BR>
<P>Excellent post Octavio. If more people like yourself stood up for good
<BR>
government and an open economy, I don't think it will be long until
<BR>
Mexico is on a political and economic par with the US and Canada.
<BR>
<P>Its rather entertaining to see the liberals up here squirm at the
<BR>
thought of opening up the border with Mexico and treating your country
<BR>
as an equal economic partner. The unions scream about NAFTA, yet they
<BR>
have done nothing to try to expand their unionizing south of the border.
<BR>
If they really cared about labor standards and employment practices
<BR>
they'd be down there backing demonstrations and reforms left and right.
<BR>
If the ecological groups were really interested in the enviornment down
<BR>
there, they'd be funding Mexican environmental groups and buying media
<BR>
time there to raise awareness. Its rather interesting to see these
<BR>
groups who claim to be progressive actually making excuses why things
<BR>
can't be done rather than how they should be done....
