AAHEMMM... Please note the subject line &quot;Nanotech Restrictions&quot; *NOT*
<BR>
&quot;Cuban-American&quot; Poltics and *NOT* &quot;WACO (yet again)&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Somedays I wonder if we will ever get to soar like the eagles when
<BR>
members of the tribe display repeated patterns of attempting takeoffs
<BR>
with bricks attached to their feet.
<BR>
<P>Oooops, splat... &quot;And another one's gone, and another one's gone, 
<BR>
And another one bites the dust&quot;...  So convenient, they fit so
<BR>
much better in the cryo tanks with their wings broken...

<EM>&gt; PM,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I call it &quot;enlightened greed&quot;, and it is driven by the principle that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the correct action is that which will benefit me most in the long term.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The important thing is that nowhere in the decision is there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consideration of what would be good or bad for anybody else,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wouldn't this system lead to mass criminal behavior?  If I am a skilled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hacker, then I can make money easier by stealing it than by working as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consultant.  According to your system, that would be best for me.  Does your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system lead to this conclusion?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, if as a result of criminal behavior, you get imprisoned, presumably
<BR>
there is a real hit to your long term benefit.  So, unless you come up
<BR>
with the foolproof perfect crime, enlightened self-interest dictates
<BR>
a fair amount of other-interest.
<BR>
<P>If you are going to live 2000 years, sooner or later you are going to
<BR>
have to deal with the cleaning up the mess of your miss-spent youth
<BR>
(e.g. pollution).  So a *real* &quot;long-term&quot; perspective includes an
<BR>
accounting for the commons, a desire to utilize and allocate resources
<BR>
most efficiently, and a desire to uplift others to your level (because
<BR>
its going to get damn boring talking to 10^10 copies of yourself), etc.
<BR>
<P>I think most people have a *lot* of rethinking to do in order to determine
<BR>
what their own self-interest is.  There are very intersting tradeoffs
<BR>
between short-term and long-term benefits.  You only favor the short
<BR>
term if you can invoke a &quot;guaranteed early termmination&quot; scenario.
<BR>
Otherwise investing for the long term is generally a better strategy.
<BR>
<P>The whole nano-terrorist perspective has problems because its applying
<BR>
current &quot;scarcity&quot; economics to a post-scarcity environment (unless
<BR>
one invokes the making 10^10 copies of oneself caveat).  The only
<BR>
terrorist situation I see that makes any sense is an &quot;irrational&quot;
<BR>
scenario where individuals are motiviated by beliefs and not by needs.
<BR>
<P>For example, Stephanson's &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;, provides no explanation
<BR>
as to why the benefits of the technologies should not be available
<BR>
to everyone.  It implicitly assumes there are some limits on energy
<BR>
or mass (for an approx. current Earth level population) and that simply
<BR>
*is not* true.
<BR>
<P>Robert
