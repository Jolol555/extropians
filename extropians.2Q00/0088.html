&nbsp;All and all, I was very glad I went, and expect this to be the start of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; much more of the same.  I am interested to hear how others on this list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saw it.

The comments by other authors captured it.
<BR>
I was transfixed. How often were you going to see an assembly of the
<BR>
digerati of
<BR>
this magnitude in one room for free? The atmosphere was electric and the
<BR>
audience
<BR>
totally engaged. What was great was that both sides of the issue were
<BR>
represented
<BR>
in the audience as well as on the panel. I believe the event reflected the
<BR>
most satisfying side of this ancient academic institution. It was a
<BR>
privilege to attend.
