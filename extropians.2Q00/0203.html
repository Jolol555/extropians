<EM>&gt; So are you suggesting that, if nukes were handy for many other things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; besides huge explosions, you'd be able to buy them at your local Radio
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Shack?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, they might not want to stock them on the shelves, what with the
<BR>
radiation hazard and all.  ;-)
<BR>
<P>But seriously, look at what has happened with other weapons of mass
<BR>
destruction.  Chemical weapons aren't quite as bad as nukes, but they aren't
<BR>
anything to sneeze at, and they are actually better tools for a terrorist or
<BR>
non-suicidal nutcase.  Nevertheless, there are thousands of civilian
<BR>
facilities all over the world that are capable of manufacturing chemical
<BR>
weapons if their owners so desire.  In fact, there are many chemical plants
<BR>
that actually do manufacture large volumes of highly toxic gasses which
<BR>
would make effective terrorist weapons.  Despite the obvious theoretical
<BR>
dangers, regulation of the chemical industry is mostly restricted to worker
<BR>
safety measures (OSHA and the like), rather than keeping the stuff away from
<BR>
lunatics.
<BR>
<P>Biological weapons are a similar situation.  Biological warfare is
<BR>
potentially much more dangerous than nuclear weapons, and yet the technology
<BR>
is in civilian hands at biotech companies all over the world.  Once again,
<BR>
many of these labs are actually used to do genetic engineering of microbes,
<BR>
and yet the regulatory climate focuses primarily on preventing accidental
<BR>
releases and ensuring the safety of commercial products.
<BR>
<P>In both cases the benefits of relatively free deployment of the technology
<BR>
are so great that efforts at strict control are doomed to failure.  Only a
<BR>
spectacular string of very scary-looking disasters would convince the public
<BR>
to support strict keep-it-away-from-lunatics regulation, and nothing like
<BR>
that has happened.  Which raises an interesting question - why haven't we
<BR>
had any serious problems with terrorist use of these technologies?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So do you think government is stupid enough to avoid regulation of
</EM><BR>
nanotech
<BR>
<EM>&gt; until *after* everybody already has a near-anything device?
</EM><BR>
<P>Now, let's not make the genie machine error here.  We know better than that.
<BR>
<P>Early nanotech will use expensive, specialized assemblers guided by arcane
<BR>
software and requiring extremely complex (and expensive) design efforts.
<BR>
That means it is only really useful to large organizations that can afford
<BR>
to hire teams of specialists to run the systems.
<BR>
<P>As the technology improves it will become cheaper, more flexible, and more
<BR>
automated, but that still doesn't mean everyone needs their own assemblers.
<BR>
You are likely to have several intermediate stages, as the cost and
<BR>
complexity of running an assembler system gradually falls.  By the time it
<BR>
is practical for an individual to have his own system, you've already had
<BR>
nanotech long enough for major economic and social changes to take place.
<BR>
<P>Even then, you still can't just make anything you want.  Designing and
<BR>
programming the things you want to build still takes effort (fantastic
<BR>
amounts of it, if you want to make things like utility fog or smart matter).
<BR>
I'm sure that AI will gradually take on more and more of this burden as time
<BR>
goes on, but it isn't going to be an instant transition.
<BR>
<P>By the time you could have real anything boxes, you are no longer talking
<BR>
about a society of human beings.  The AI technology that powers the anything
<BR>
box could also be used for uploading, programming sentient AI, enhancing
<BR>
human intelligence, etc.
<BR>
<P>So, if you want to talk about human societies with some vague resemblance to
<BR>
the ones that currently exist, that means you're talking about early
<BR>
nanotech at most.  If you want to talk about a society with more advanced
<BR>
nanotech and/or AI, we need to take into account the effects of very rapid
<BR>
economic growth, ubiquitous robotics, virtual worlds, enhanced reality,
<BR>
moderately advanced physiological reconstruction/enhancement technology, and
<BR>
all the other fun stuff that is likely to turn the world upside down before
<BR>
those advanced technologies ever get here.
