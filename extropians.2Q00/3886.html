First of all: 
<BR>
<P>I find it amazing that extropians stille exhibit any interest in this topic 
<BR>
after the moratorium and losing several people off the list. 
<BR>
I find it even more bizzare that certain individuals have ANYTHING left to 
<BR>
say after all the hot air we have had to endure... but here it is, back in 
<BR>
full swing! 
<BR>
<P>Or should I say when it comes to this topic -- some people have low impulse 
<BR>
control. 
<BR>
<P>I understand as well as the next guy/gal that censoring by topics sucks, that 
<BR>
really sucks... it would have to be dropped out of politeness. 
<BR>
<P>OK, so we don't care about politeness. We don't care about offending anyone...
<BR>
<P>I've heard the Libertarian drone...  &quot;Hell,  I don't give a damn about what 
<BR>
anyone says about me, I am not a lemming, I am not here to please anyone but 
<BR>
myself... 
<BR>
Damn it,  we are INDIVIDUALS&quot;.
<BR>
But.... 
<BR>
When some teenie boppers asked us to not make any sex references - 
<BR>
... everyone just said OH YESSIREE, LET'S CENSOR OURSELVES, we wouldn't want 
<BR>
to offend anyone's grandparents!! 
<BR>
<P>ROTFLMAO
