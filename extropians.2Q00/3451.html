<P>Gambling.  I see this as *the coming thing* in civil disobedience.
<BR>
This will only work for a while, because restrictions on gambling
<BR>
are already fading away, and I think they will eventually evaporate
<BR>
entirely, along with all laws against victimless crime.  Then the
<BR>
only real crimes left will be those that really really do hurt someone,
<BR>
such as robbery, rape, murder, etc, laws against which almost no
<BR>
one wants to see eliminated. At that time, good riddance to
<BR>
the feeling of having gotten away with something.
<BR>
<P>A possible substitute would be a final solution to the problem
<BR>
of weight gain as a result of overeating.  I predict that this holy
<BR>
grail of medical science will be discovered in the next 20 years,
<BR>
providing each person with the option of eating whatever they
<BR>
want, and getting that satisfying feeling of having cheated the
<BR>
odds by escaping the usual consequences.
<BR>
<P>Of course, this is only a temporary, for the day this solution
<BR>
is discovered, a generation is born that knew nothing else,
<BR>
and will never understand why weight control was such an
<BR>
obsession.  But I digress.  spike
