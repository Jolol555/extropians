&nbsp;&nbsp;Australian Gun Ban Proved Disastrous
<BR>
<P>Dr. Miguel Faria
<BR>
Monday, June 26, 2000
<BR>
Last August, the rugged Aussie survivalist whose
<BR>
real-life exploits inspired the &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;
<BR>
movies died in what then appeared to be a mysterious
<BR>
shootout with Australian police. A police sergeant was
<BR>
also killed in the incident.
<BR>
It was reported that 44-year-old blond-haired Rodney
<BR>
William Ansell resembled uncannily Paul Hogan, the
<BR>
actor who played his part in the movie and the sequel.
<BR>
Although Ansell was no angel and had had previous
<BR>
run-ins with police, he had been named 1988 Australian
<BR>
Northern Territory Man of the Year for inspiring the
<BR>
movie and putting &quot;the Australian Outback on the map.&quot;
<BR>
<P>What motivated this shooting? In 1996, Australia
<BR>
adopted draconian gun control laws banning certain
<BR>
guns (60 percent of all firearms), requiring
<BR>
registration of all firearms and licensing of all gun
<BR>
owners. &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; believed the police were
<BR>
coming to confiscate his unregistered firearms.
<BR>
<P>In Australia today, police can enter your house and
<BR>
search for guns, copy the hard drive of your computer,
<BR>
seize records, and do it all without a search warrant.
<BR>
It's the law that police can go door to door searching
<BR>
for weapons that have not been surrendered in their
<BR>
much publicized gun buy-back program. They have been
<BR>
using previous registration and firearm license lists
<BR>
to check for lapses and confiscate non-surrendered
<BR>
firearms.
<BR>
<P>It all began with the Port Arthur (a Tasmanian resort)
<BR>
tragedy on April 28, 1996, when a crazed assailant
<BR>
opened fire and shot 35 people. Australians were
<BR>
shocked, and the government reacted quickly.
<BR>
<P>Draconian gun legislation was passed in the heat of
<BR>
the moment because the fate of the nation was
<BR>
determined by a handful of statist socialists who find
<BR>
individual freedom abhorrent. Consider the politics:
<BR>
There are three major parties in Australian politics:
<BR>
the center right (Liberal Party), the socialist camp
<BR>
(Labor Party) and the ultra-left (Australian
<BR>
Democratic Party) – this last one easily tilted the
<BR>
balance of power toward stringent gun control at the
<BR>
expense of freedom. Moreover, to add insult to injury,
<BR>
Australia has had to toe the party line of the United
<BR>
Nations on environmental issues, land/property rights,
<BR>
and now, gun control as well.
<BR>
<P>As a result of stringent gun laws (really a ban on
<BR>
firearms) in Australia, all semiautomatic firearms
<BR>
(rifles and handguns) are proscribed, including
<BR>
.22-caliber rabbit guns and duck-hunting Remington
<BR>
shotguns.
<BR>
<P>Writing in The Gun Owners (Jan. 31, 2000), the
<BR>
newsletter for Gun Owners of America (GOA), former
<BR>
California State Senator H.L. Richardson notes: &quot;They
<BR>
outlawed every semi-auto, even those pretty duck guns,
<BR>
the Browning A5 and the Remington 1100s. They even
<BR>
struck down pump shotguns: the Winchester model 12 and
<BR>
the Remington 870...Do you own a Browning BAR rifle?
<BR>
Banned. How about a Winchester Model 100? Out of luck,
<BR>
all semi-auto hunting rifles were outlawed as well.
<BR>
They didn¹t miss a one.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Be that as it may, at a cost of $500 million, out of
<BR>
an estimated 7 million firearms (of which 2.8 million
<BR>
were prohibited), only 640,000 guns were surrendered
<BR>
to police. What has been the result? Same as in
<BR>
England. Like in Great Britain, crime Down Under has
<BR>
escalated.
<BR>
<P>Twelve months after the law was implemented in 1997,
<BR>
there has been a 44 percent increase in armed
<BR>
robberies, an 8.6 percent increase in aggravated
<BR>
assaults, and a 3.2 percent increase in homicides.
<BR>
That same year in the state of Victoria, there was a
<BR>
300 percent increase in homicides committed with
<BR>
firearms. The following year, robberies increased
<BR>
almost 60 percent in South Australia. By 1999,
<BR>
assaults had increased in New South Wales by almost 20
<BR>
percent.
<BR>
<P>Two years after the ban, there have been further
<BR>
increases in crime: armed robberies by 73 percent;
<BR>
unarmed robberies by 28 percent; kidnappings by 38
<BR>
percent; assaults by 17 percent; manslaughter by 29
<BR>
percent, according to the Australian Bureau of
<BR>
Statistics.
<BR>
<P>And consider the fact that over the previous 25-year
<BR>
period, Australia had shown a steady decrease both in
<BR>
homicide with firearms and armed robbery – until the
<BR>
ban.
<BR>
<P>Australia, a semi-arid, isolated continent and a vast
<BR>
nation-state, in many ways parallels the history of
<BR>
the United States. In the 1850s and 1860s, it had gold
<BR>
rushes and pioneering settlers, reminiscent of our own
<BR>
western migration.
<BR>
<P>In World War I and World War II, it fought with the
<BR>
allies. Australia remained a subject of Great British
<BR>
until 1986, when the last ties with the British crown
<BR>
were dissolved.
<BR>
<P>With only 19 million people, Australia has an
<BR>
impressive fauna that includes plenty of varmints,
<BR>
marsupials, dingoes (that wreak havoc on livestock),
<BR>
as well as large rats and other rodents. Yet, hunting
<BR>
has become prohibitively difficult for all but a
<BR>
handful of Australians with private lands and the
<BR>
usual connections. Now, the ban on firearms and the
<BR>
disarmament of ordinary Australians has left criminals
<BR>
free to roam the countryside as they please.
<BR>
<P>Bandits, of course, kept their guns. Like in America,
<BR>
only the law-abiding, by definition, obey the law.
<BR>
Yet, the leftist Australian government has responded
<BR>
by passing more laws; in 1998 Bowie knives and other
<BR>
knives and items including handcuffs were banned.
<BR>
<P>Licensing is difficult. Self and family protection is
<BR>
not considered a valid reason to own a firearm. The
<BR>
right to self-defense, like in Great Britain and
<BR>
Canada, is not recognized in Australia, Like
<BR>
Americans, Australians loved and possessed firearms –
<BR>
that is, until the ban. Freedom has been extinguished.
<BR>
A way of life has ended. Please, don't tell me it
<BR>
cannot happen here!
