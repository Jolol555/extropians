I haven't been getting enough other things done, and I've sworn off posting
<BR>
to lists for a while, but I'm beside myself with rage after reading the
<BR>
Green Party Platform.  This is the worst bunch of crap I've ever seen as a
<BR>
party platform in this country.  At least the old socialist types didn't
<BR>
want to totally destroy industry. What's especially disturbing is that they
<BR>
apparently have talented advertising people working for them.  They're using
<BR>
all the right buzzwords and have the thing laid out in such a way that a
<BR>
cursory reading would make it look at lot less scary than it actually is.
<BR>
Remember when I was lamenting about how people just see a couple of words
<BR>
and draw a conclusion without reading the whole document?  That's what's
<BR>
gonna happen here, I'm afraid.
<BR>
<P>Thank you, zeb, for bringing this to our attention.  I shall urge everyone I
<BR>
know who might be taken in by this shit to read the whole thing and think it
<BR>
through before supporting it.

<EM>&gt; (Though this may be a little off-topic from what your post was about)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think it's very important to be familiar with the green party's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I looked at it a few days ago, it's at <A HREF="http://www.greenparty.org">http://www.greenparty.org</A>. I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really stuck at how scary it was. I knew it would be pretty bad,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not believe the aggresive backwardsness of it.
