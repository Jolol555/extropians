<P>You would have to ask Greg.

<P><EM>&gt; 	I'd sure hate to have nanorobots going through my corpsicle,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potentially destroying relevant information, before we have clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understanding of such &quot;mental information maps&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, one would hope that they &quot;never&quot; destroy information.
<BR>
However, it is doubtful whether a complete understanding
<BR>
of how data is stored in the brain is necessary to put it
<BR>
back togeather.
<BR>
<P>Use this analogy -- do you have to &quot;understand&quot; the picture
<BR>
on the jigsaw puzzle piece if you can determine precisely
<BR>
where in the puzzle it should go?  (I.e. can you assemble
<BR>
a jigsaw puzzle with the picture facing away from you?)
<BR>
<P>(For humans this may be harder than assembling it *with*
<BR>
the pictures, because we use the pictures to localize the
<BR>
search area for the pieces (at least I do).  However, for
<BR>
a computer with a lot of excess processing capacity, and
<BR>
clever shape sorting algorithms, the interpretation of what
<BR>
is &quot;on/in&quot; the piece is irrelevant to putting it in its correct
<BR>
place.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm almost tempted to put a clause in my cryonics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; documentation that stipulates my desire to only ever use non invasive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or non destructive scans of information from my corpsicle.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is questionable whether you could be put back together in
<BR>
that case.  It really doesn't matter if I have to disassemble
<BR>
a glucose or fat molecule in order to map things, so long as
<BR>
I can put an identical molecule back in the proper place when
<BR>
I put things back together.  This begs the copy issue, for which
<BR>
I'd refer one to the recent Moravec re: Harvard doesn't Publish
<BR>
in Science Fiction.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be completely rebuilt, or upload, whichever comes first, and still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have my corpsicle as a keepsake, for a permanent backup, and in case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something unforeseen got lost in a corpsicle destroying reanimation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process.
</EM><BR>
<P>The way to do this is to specify uploading only after it has
<BR>
been proven to be &quot;robust&quot;.  However, if Robin is correct about
<BR>
the singularity economics, this probably dooms you to a second-hand
<BR>
existence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	How will the two not come at about the same time?  How could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we have nanobots able to completely rebuild a brain yet not have full
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowledge of it's data maps?
</EM><BR>
<P>Nanobots mapping/rebuilding the brain is a physical issue (where are
<BR>
the atoms/molecules now and where do they really belong).  The
<BR>
data maps (i.e. the information required to translate the software
<BR>
to run on different hardware) is much more complex.  I can hand you
<BR>
terabytes of data (where all the physical connections are in the
<BR>
brain) but that does not suggest that you have any ability to
<BR>
understand how to execute that combination of code+data in a
<BR>
way that results in an instantiation of a &quot;you-unit&quot;.  Running
<BR>
a human on &quot;alien&quot; hardware is much more complex than simply
<BR>
copying one (or putting one back together on the original equipment).
<BR>
<P>Greg isn't a computer scientist though, so he may not
<BR>
have the perspective I do about the difficulty of translating
<BR>
code to run on different hardware.  This points out the problem
<BR>
we have that we are getting into an evolutionary time where
<BR>
multidisciplinary teams are really required to really understand
<BR>
the trends and tradeoffs.
