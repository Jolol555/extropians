<P>
There have been several programs on TV that have talked about ufo's and
<BR>
related objects and they have showed many balls of light, orbs, etc.
<BR>
<P>I think that we will come to know that these objects, including those
<BR>
seen during WW II, are plasma energy that was induced by humans on earth
<BR>
using Tesla technology or some similar technology.  There is probably
<BR>
some kind technology available where we can &quot;squeeze&quot; the earth,
<BR>
atmosphere, biosphere, etc. and it creates a bulge/affect on the
<BR>
opposite side or some other location.   Think of pinching a balloon and
<BR>
the bulge appears someplace else.  The &quot;pinch&quot; may traverse the earth
<BR>
and produce the affect on the opposite side of the earth or at some
<BR>
other location.  The HAARP system may have something to do with this.
<BR>
It may create a location for the plasma to manifest.
<BR>
<P>I think some are the result of earth dynamics too.   I believe those
<BR>
have been adequately described before as piezo in nature and the result
<BR>
of seismic pressures creating plasma electricity above the ground.
<BR>
There have been reports of &quot;dancing lights&quot; above fault lines before,
<BR>
during and after earthquakes and in seismic areas.
<BR>
<P>Although all the major countries denied that they were the ones
<BR>
producing the green orbs called foo fighters during WW II, it doesn't
<BR>
take much to realize that even if we were producing those lights, we
<BR>
would not admit it and probably the same would be true for any other
<BR>
country.  That would add to the mystery, maintain the illusion and not
<BR>
give away secret technology and the level of our science, albeit, secret
<BR>
and black.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, just some thoughts.
<BR>
<P>Peace and regards, Pat Frye
