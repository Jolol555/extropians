<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Surveillance has *nothing* to do with freedom.  You are free now to do

<EM>&gt; &gt; anything that is legal.  You would have that exact same freedom in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; completely transparent society.  Your only loss of freedom would be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; freedom to commit a crime and get away with it.  If you have a problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; giving that up, I think that says more about you than it says about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes.  It says that my ideas of morality are not identical to those of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;current lawmakers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Morality is not the issue.  Legality is.  They are not synonyms.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;	My current life partner is of the same gender as I am.  Sometimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we hold hands when we are walking down the street.  Sometimes, when no one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else is around, I even kiss her.  In many places, this is still listed as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a crime.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not saying every law on the books is a good law.  What I am saying is,
<BR>
if the law is bad, don't break it, work to get it changed (unless like
<BR>
Martin Luther King you are breaking the law with an agenda).
<BR>
<P>But then for every rule there *is* an exception.  Although I am married and
<BR>
heterosexual, I am vehemently opposed to laws that proscribe the sexual
<BR>
behavior of consenting adults.  The laws against consensual homosexual acts
<BR>
are downright wrong (IMO) and do not carry the moral authority to compel
<BR>
obedience to them.  The *only* good thing about such laws is the infrequency
<BR>
of their enforcement.
<BR>
<P>I see such laws as being analogous to the 19th Century Supreme Court
<BR>
decision that &quot;no black man has any rights which any white man is obliged to
<BR>
respect.&quot;  I know that *some people* on this list will now take this as an
<BR>
opportunity to show what a hypocrite I am.  &quot;You say, don't break the law,
<BR>
but its OK to violate laws against sodomy?&quot;  All I can say is, for every
<BR>
rule there is an exception.  For me, sodomy is one of the few exceptions.
<BR>
(Again, even though it is *not* a law that *I* have any personal desire to
<BR>
violate.  But for those who do, they can have at it with my blessing.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;	When I'm walking around with my friends, we often discuss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possiblilities for the future--any and all, including futures in which the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;United States government no longer exists (we are none of us liable to act
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to further such a future, but it's awkward to insert disclaimers such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this one into all of our statements).  This is definitely illegal.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is absolutely *not* illegal.  We can discuss here in writing such
<BR>
possibilities with no fear of prosecution.  It's called the 1st Amendment.
<BR>
Unless when you *said* you &quot;discuss futures in which the
<BR>
United States government no longer exists&quot; what you *meant* was &quot;we
<BR>
affirmatively advocate in our discussions the violent overthrow of the
<BR>
government.&quot;  In that case, yes, you would be breaking the law, and you
<BR>
would do well to keep such discussions secret, transparent society or no.
<BR>
(In other words, if that *is* what you meant, it would *not* be a good idea
<BR>
to reply to this post by saying &quot;yeah, that's exactly what I meant&quot;, if you
<BR>
know what I mean.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It says that I don't like being watched under the assumption that I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;going to do something nasty.  I don't like being stared at by policemen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;either.  I particularly don't like being watched by people I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see.  This is a matter of aesthetic preference.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well yes, that is a matter of personal preference.  I personally don't mind
<BR>
being stared at by cops.  And I am not one to &quot;straighten my posture&quot; when I
<BR>
know I'm being watched by authorities.  But this confidence no doubt comes
<BR>
from a keen awareness of the law and my rights under it.  I know what I can
<BR>
and cannot legally do, and I know what the cops can and cannot legally do to
<BR>
me.  However, such confidence comes from a level of diligence and vigilence
<BR>
that, I admit, not everyone wishes to invest.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;While constraint of behavior is by no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;means equivalent to constraint of thought, the two do tend to go together
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;psychologically.  Certainly dialogue, or communicative behavior, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;constrained.  Furthermore, if people know the government is watching them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at particular street-corners, they are likely to come into the habit of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;assuming surveilance elsewhere and modifying their behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accordingly.  Therefore surveilance is likely to, long-run, decrease the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;flow of new ideas in public, and the diversity of public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;appearance/behavior.  This is not extropic.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't agree.  I think it will lead to a lot more people paying closer
<BR>
attention to what the laws provide so that they can govern themselves in
<BR>
public with the kind of confidence I discussed above.  Voluntarily modifying
<BR>
your own behavior because you aren't sure of the law is the lazy person's
<BR>
way of avoiding trouble with the law.  *That* IMO is not extropic.  Liberty
<BR>
comes with a price, that price is responsibility.  One responsibility of a
<BR>
free citizen is to understand the law and (1) abide by it or (2) work to
<BR>
change it.
<BR>
<P>Living in ignorance of the law, and then cowering in fear that you might
<BR>
accidentally run afoul of it is not excuse enough for me to favor
<BR>
constraining the right of the public or the government to detect criminal
<BR>
behavior, even by the admittedly drastic means of surveillance.  But I do
<BR>
recognize that, as in most things, your mileage may vary.
<BR>
<P>-Zero

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
