<P>
The Fermi Paradox argues that Robin is correct and intelligent life
<BR>
capable of constructing and managing its niche is very rare, or
<BR>
a very different set of ecological management tools, e.g. a
<BR>
Morovecian simulation ecology takes over for the &quot;natural&quot; methods.
<BR>
<P>The Moravec (Robots) perspective seems to me to be still operating
<BR>
in the &quot;real&quot; universe.  I.e. the point of the simulations is to
<BR>
allow the construction of something physical.  However, if reasonable
<BR>
goals of conscious evolution are to increase complexity as efficiently
<BR>
as possible and minimize the &quot;real&quot; losses associated with the deaths
<BR>
of bad ideas (taking a page from the Book of Burch that wants push the
<BR>
morality of the mind as far as possible and still allow for any evolution
<BR>
at all), then there would seem at some point to be the necessity for a
<BR>
logical transition from operating in the &quot;real&quot; world to operating entirely
<BR>
in the &quot;virtual&quot; simulation.
<BR>
<P>Some questions related to this would be:
<BR>
(a) What are the (energy/entropy) costs of destroying information in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the real world vs. the virtual world?  [Reversible computing is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going to produce the densest computing but it does so at the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expense of minimizing the erasing bits.]
<BR>
(b) Is the real world less expensive than the virtual world for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;storing&quot; an arbitrary amount of information?  [It seems to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me that a virtual world based on storage in photons should
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be cheaper than a real world based on storage in atoms.]
<BR>
(c) Does a virtual simulation where any conscious sub-SIs are &quot;informed&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that their &quot;beingness&quot; may at any point be &quot;suspended&quot; or even
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;erased&quot; satisfy the Burch &quot;Morality of Mind&quot; requirements?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[I.e. you are in approximately the same boat we are in today
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in that death from &quot;accidents&quot; may occur, only in the moral-SI
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simulation it would be &quot;painless&quot;.]
<BR>
<P>So, the elimination of unconscious species is of little interest to any SIs,
<BR>
since it is a &quot;process&quot; of the universe, like the birth and death of stars.
<BR>
Conscious species may be of interest since they may &quot;join the club&quot;.
<BR>
That leads to the allow vs. disallow interventions questions which
<BR>
would seem to depend on the relative value of additional club members
<BR>
vs. uniquely evolved club members (that may increase diversity).
<BR>
<P>If any of the above holds water, then we are looking at the Fermi
<BR>
Paradox from the perspective of a &quot;flat earth&quot;, not realizing
<BR>
the full realm in which ecologies and minds can operate and thus
<BR>
have a difficult time answering the question correctly.

<EM>&gt; OK.  But keep in mind that if we look at *all* of the species that
