<P>&lt;&lt; ZERO SAID: ...&quot;I know Durk &amp; Sandy of the LEF have been
<BR>
&nbsp;researching/experimenting on themselves for a couple decades now.
<BR>
&nbsp;Anybody know whether they (or any other long term LE'ers) are reaping any
<BR>
&nbsp;benefits?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;CYMM SAYS: With all due respect, such people might be primarily marketers.
<BR>
&nbsp;Certainly they have been reaping appropriate benefits. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Their lives may have been extended, their physical appearence is about that 
<BR>
of people of average age (old hippies). They used to promote on the Merv 
<BR>
Griffin show, but aside from the usual bullshit artists, Durk seemed 
<BR>
knowlegable in the sciences regarding energy and spaceflight, which were more 
<BR>
interesting at the time to me.
