<EM>&gt; Interesting.  So, if you were blindfolded, do you think you could smell the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference between a Japanese and a Mexican and tell us which was which?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I think so, though I am not 100% positive.  As I said, this is something
<BR>
I've noticed; my aggregate sample size may not be large enough to mean
<BR>
anything, although my samples do cover a broad range of ethnic groups.  I
<BR>
do know of other people who have noticed the same thing though.
<BR>
<P>Also, this isn't that precise, so I wouldn't say &quot;Japanese&quot;; the person
<BR>
could just as likely be Korean or similar.  However, I think a person that
<BR>
&quot;trained&quot; their nose could make race determination quite accurately.  My
<BR>
nose really hasn't been in training lately, so my smell memory is a
<BR>
bit weak right now :^)  However, Mexican versus Japanese should be pretty
<BR>
easy to differentiate.
<BR>
<P>Surely I'm not the only person on this list to notice this.
