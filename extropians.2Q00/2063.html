<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone who is bored by such discussion, just remember that your future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; wearables/surgical implants may very well run an MS or MS derived OS,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; At the moment, I do find this quite unlikely. I'm active on some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the wearable lists, and have my own construction in progress (minus the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; display, for now).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which lists would be good for a wearable-wannabe like myself? I'm not much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a hardware junky... I just want to be a robot. Too much Doctor Who when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was a littlun. I saw the cybermen, and thought &quot;Now there's a plan...&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>At the moment, I would advise you join wear-hard (send to
<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:wear-hard-request@haven.org?Subject=Re:%20Working%20Within%20the%20System&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000502153711.A8218@melchior&gt;">wear-hard-request@haven.org</A> with 'subscribe' in body), as it is
<BR>
currently where pretty much all the action is, &amp; all topics are
<BR>
discussed. Just ignore particularly technical posts - some of it
<BR>
goes over my head too :) 
<BR>
<P>The other lists I am involved in are the UK regional one, and a private
<BR>
list developing the wearables.org.uk site.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Completely off topic, my personal continuing investigation of COM (MS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architecture for bits of programs to talk to each other) has led to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting information that Linux now has COM, which the Kylix project
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Delphi on Linux, a Borland/Inprise project) will use to make Delphi work on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux, and make Delphi code portable between Windows and Linux (I imagine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with severe restrictions). More interesting than that is the very real idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a heterogeneous network of Linux &amp; Windows machines can have programs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communicating via COM (more correctly DCOM), which is really a very high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level communications architecture. So some really hardcore interoperability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between Linux and Windows is becoming available.
</EM><BR>
<P>Linux does have some very interesting ideas of its own in this area,
<BR>
notably the CORBA/Bonobo structures being used in GNOME.
<BR>
<P>Miguel de Icaza, the lead GNOME developer, discusses the status and
<BR>
future plans of these in a recent Slashdot interview, which makes good
<BR>
reading if you are interested in this aspect of application
<BR>
infrastructure.

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So this Linux vs Windows stuff... should we all just kiss and make up? I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using the dark side of the force, in case you haven't noticed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would quite like to make this 'discussion' more friendly :-)
