Subject: Understanding Academia
<BR>
<P>Robin, an interesting post. My background as a commercial publisher did not
<BR>
prepare me at all for the labyrinthine world of academic journals (when I
<BR>
returned to post-grad research a while back) ..... and I was horrified to
<BR>
realise that many of the points you make in your posting are true. I have
<BR>
always refused to submit any of my MVT (Median Vision Theory)  material to
<BR>
any academic journals ..... mainly because they don't pay much but expect
<BR>
all the reproduction rights. Since I am not a &quot;career academic&quot; publishing
<BR>
in these journals and playing the silly game you detail, always seemed
<BR>
pointless to me. I prefer to retain my own copyrights.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I think it helps a lot to understand why academics do what they do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For the most part it is not because they are stupid or lack imagination.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It is mostly because they are using a winning strategy in the game
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they are playing: publish or perish.  Sure lots of people aren't willing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to sacrifice their principles to play this strategy.  But a strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;selection effect insures that they are a minority in academia.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;22.  Do not write papers with breakthrough ideas at first
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Avoid writing about your breakthrough ideas, at least in the early stage of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your career, unless your mentor is the editor of a major journal.
</EM><BR>
<P>There might be other reasons for this too. If an idea is genuinely new, then
<BR>
there are not going to be a lot of &quot;references&quot; you can cite, and academics
<BR>
love references since they have a community bonding function.
<BR>
<P>In my case, MVT offers a solution to the hard/ mind problem in philosophy,
<BR>
which reduces all the second-order theorising and &quot;made-up names&quot; that
<BR>
comprises the &quot;Analytic&quot; school of philosophy. Academics want to perpetuate
<BR>
problems, not solve them ... it simply isn't in their interest to shorten
<BR>
their &quot;philosopher's debate.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you do advance breakthrough ideas your papers will be rejected, and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might reappear in a modified, clearly written form from someone else later.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is good that new and challenging ideas have an airing on this extropian
<BR>
list. I am in the lucky position of having experience of 4 different
<BR>
Universities but do not have to play the academics' game, so am free to
<BR>
press a post-human reform agenda (at www.Att.ac and
<BR>
ww.EXTROPIA.net  -zine).
<BR>
<P>Does anyone else have negative experiences of academic politics?
