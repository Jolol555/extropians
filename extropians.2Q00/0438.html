<EM>&gt;Here's an interesting fact about the States: you get to choose where you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want to live.  Comparing homicide rates in two countries as large as ours
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is almost worthless, unless you suppose you'll settle down in a fully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;random location.

<P><EM>&gt;Ellis Wyatt

<P>A telling argument. In Australia, by contrast, the commissars roster us at
<BR>
birth to certain localities. Our internal passports do not permit us to
<BR>
move outside the small region to which we have been allocated. There's
<BR>
barbed wire everywhere, and machine guns set up at the checkpoints.
<BR>
Visiting black ghetto Americans are astonished to witness these
<BR>
restrictions. But we don't mind too much, since our crime figures are lower.
<BR>

<BR>
[actually, all irony aside, Australian blacks *have* been treated
<BR>
abominably. There's a furious debate at the moment over the `stolen
<BR>
generation' created by a do-gooding imperial policy of government
<BR>
kidnappings of a third or more of part-aboriginal children, forcibly
<BR>
removed from their mothers and taken to orphanages for adoption; the plan
<BR>
was to assimilate/deracinate them for their own good. The reaction to this
<BR>
grotesque tragedy is slowly building among the now-middle-aged victims.
<BR>
Expect to hear more about this during the Sydney Olympics.]
