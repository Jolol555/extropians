<P><EM>&gt; Extract from <A HREF="http://www.harrybrowne.org/">http://www.harrybrowne.org/</A> (US libertarian presidential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; candidate):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Today (according to the U.S. Census Bureau) federal, state, and local taxes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take 47% of the national income.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i.e. those in the &quot;land of the free&quot; spend close to 50% of their working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lives (minus market value of those public services they actually wanted) as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government owned slaves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NB I don't think the situation is much better in Britain - I hope the figure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't as high as that, but it wouldn't suprise me if it was. (In the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recent budget here there were a lot of &quot;stealth&quot; tax increases which don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; show up in simple income tax calculations). My point is that both sides of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this mini US v UK tax debate seem to be seriously underestimating the amount
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stolen by their respective governments.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, this is understood. The fact you have the VAT and atrociously high gas
<BR>
taxes, taxes on every TV and closet should be indicative though. The 47% figure
<BR>
quoted above for the US includes the portion of our consumer expenditures that
<BR>
pay for corporate profit and income taxes, , which do act as a bit of a VAT in
<BR>
an indirect way, though they are applied only to the net revinues of the
<BR>
corporations producing the products we buy, rather than to the gross. There are
<BR>
also sales taxes, gas taxes, communications taxes, etc... I'd be interested in
<BR>
seeing a similar calculation done on Britain. I doubt you'd see one though, its
<BR>
probably covered under the Official Secrets Act.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And as for Martin Ling's comments:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;It's not stealing if those people have agreed to pay. Which, technically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they have. By remaining in the country, and by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upholding the government and its taxation policies.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sorry, but this is ludicrous.  The fact that I haven't emigrated is in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no way an endorsement of government theft of my money.  I didn't vote for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them and the only reason I &quot;agree to pay&quot; (to use your terminology) is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because if I don't, my property itself will be stolen or I'll be imprisoned.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By your logic, there's nothing wrong with protection rackets run by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organised crminals - because after all, their victims have &quot;agreed to pay&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (if only to prevent their property from being torched), and of course, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could always move to a different part of the country.
</EM><BR>
<P>At its heart, there is little difference between governments and protection
<BR>
rackets. The only difference is one tries to make the silly assertion that the
<BR>
input of the individual has any real bearing on what is done to him by that
<BR>
protection racket.
