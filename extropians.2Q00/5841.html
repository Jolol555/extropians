<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
I had recorded the Charlie Rose show from Tuesday night and finally
<BR>
watched it.  It was an interview with Dr. Francis Collins, head of the
<BR>
Human Genome Project.
<BR>
<P>Collins comes off as an enthusiastic and energetic guy in this wide
<BR>
ranging interview.  However he is rather conventional ethically, a
<BR>
religious man, and this seemed to color some of his responses.
<BR>
<P>Rose pressed him on whether it would be possible to use the information
<BR>
from the genome to engineer a &quot;super race&quot;.  Collins offered as an example
<BR>
the modification of the genome to make someone who was intelligent,
<BR>
strong, good looking, and so on.
<BR>
<P>He said that this was not likely to be possible.  First, many of these
<BR>
factors are largely (50%) environmental.  Second, most of these are coded
<BR>
by many different genes interacting in a complex way.  It is unlikely
<BR>
that people would be successful in making modifications that come out
<BR>
the way they hope.
<BR>
<P>My reaction was that he was spinning this the way he wanted.  At best
<BR>
these considerations will delay this outcome.
<BR>
<P>Rose also asked whether genomic information would be helpful in targetting
<BR>
some kind of genetic weapon against &quot;certain groups.&quot;  Collins said that
<BR>
this would probably not work, because racial groups have almost as much
<BR>
variation within themselves as between races.
<BR>
<P>I was also skeptical about this answer.  I suspect a sufficiently
<BR>
motivated racial terrorist could identify some gene complex which would
<BR>
be found almost entirely among members of a given race.  Not all people
<BR>
who are considered members of that race would have it, but it would not
<BR>
be found much at all among other groups.  As a trivial example, there
<BR>
is something genetic that makes Africans predisposed to have dark skin.
<BR>
Theoretically the presence of those genetic factors could trigger some
<BR>
kind of artificial disease.
<BR>
<P>They also talked about the problem of genetic information being used
<BR>
to discriminate against people with bad genomes by insurance companies
<BR>
or employers.  Collins said that there should be a law to prevent this.
<BR>
<P>I wish we could have a system similar to AIDS tests, where you can be
<BR>
tested anonymously.  The Internet would be a perfect medium for getting
<BR>
an objective and anonymous analysis of your genome.
<BR>
<P>As with AIDS tests, if you do turn out to have treatable problems then it
<BR>
is probably not practical to retain anonymity.  If your insurance company
<BR>
is paying for the therapy which inhibits some diseases to which you have
<BR>
a genetic predisposition, they're going to find this out about you.  So the
<BR>
question would be how often this would happen.
<BR>
<P>You could envision a system where there was a sort of &quot;minimum
<BR>
disclosure&quot;.  You'd get your genome analyzed anonymously, but get an
<BR>
official certificate that you could use to selectively reveal certain
<BR>
parts.  When a new treatment becomes available that will benefit you,
<BR>
you reveal that part of your genome and you can get treated.  You don't
<BR>
give away information on problems until there is a treatment for them,
<BR>
and you use the net to stay informed about new treatments.
<BR>
<P>Another issue that Collins discussed was the possibility of human cloning.
<BR>
He hopes it never happens, for ethical reasons, but didn't go into much
<BR>
detail.  He also said that he hopes that germ line engineering never
<BR>
happens, apparently for the same reasons.  It's not clear whether he was
<BR>
worried about accidents causing harm to unborn victims, or whether it
<BR>
was a reflection of his religious view and this would be too close to
<BR>
&quot;playing God&quot;.
<BR>
<P>At the end of the interview Rose asked Collins to try to imagine what it
<BR>
would be like to look back from 100 years in the future, to consider what
<BR>
discoveries and knowledge we might have by that time.  Collins briefly
<BR>
described the incredible advances in biology over the past 100 years,
<BR>
and said that it was truly impossible to imagine what things would be
<BR>
like 100 years from now.  When you look at the curves and trends towards
<BR>
increasing knowledge, it becomes impossible to predict more than about
<BR>
20 years out, he said.
<BR>
<P>It's too bad he didn't take that next logical step, but I suppose his
<BR>
religious views forbid it.  Does he really think we are going to have
<BR>
100 times more knowledge than today, but not use it?  We won't modify
<BR>
the germ line to eliminate problems and add enhancements?  We won't make
<BR>
changes which challenge the very definition of what it means to be human?
<BR>
<P>These tools are going to exist, and they will satisfy human needs that
<BR>
go back thousands of years.  Collins hopes that medical ethicists and
<BR>
theologians will convince us not to use these tools, but (I suppose)
<BR>
content ourselves with abstract admiration of all that we will know
<BR>
about how the body works.  Not very likely IMO.
<BR>
<P>It would have been nice to see a little more courage and vision at
<BR>
this point.  Perhaps the other episodes this week will look farther out.
<BR>
