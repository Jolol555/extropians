<EM>&gt;  Subject: Risks and Life Insurance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Someone brought to my attention that John Grigg had asked for my 
</EM><BR>
experience 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  (and Fred Chamberlain's) on delaying buying life insurance.
</EM><BR>
<P>As a lawyer who has done a good deal of work related to life insurance, I 
<BR>
can't stress enough how wise Mike Darwin's advice is.  Buying a whole life 
<BR>
policy to support a cryonics contract when you're relatively young and 
<BR>
healthy is CHEAP.  Yes, medical technology and other things may develop fast 
<BR>
enough that you don't end up needing this investment by say, 2050, when you 
<BR>
might be a candidate for suspension.  But if that's how things turn out, your 
<BR>
life insurance policy will have turned out to be only a so-so investment - 
<BR>
you can still have the cash value if the tools of cryonics and life insurance 
<BR>
are somehow made obsolete.  In retrospect, your life insurance policy will 
<BR>
have been a savings account which you can spend on a trip to Io or more RAM 
<BR>
for your uploaded self.
<BR>
<P>If you're in your 20s or 30s, you really ought to get a quote on a life 
<BR>
insurance policy to fund a cryonics contract.  It costs nothing to do so and 
<BR>
is pretty easy and quick.  Just finding out how inexpensive it is will be may 
<BR>
be the best spur to going ahead getting signed up.  If you're interested, I 
<BR>
or any other Alcor member can refer you to a life insurance agent who can 
<BR>
work with you.  Mary Naples sold me the NYLife whole life policy I used to 
<BR>
fund my suspension contract.  She's a real professional with extremely high 
<BR>
business ethics and has done a lot to make cryonics a financially viable 
<BR>
alternative to turning into worm food.
