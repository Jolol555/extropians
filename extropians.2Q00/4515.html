<P><EM>&gt; What if there is a convention adopted by the entities involved that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unconstrained replication is not allowed.  Any unconstrained replication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is viewed as a threat and is prevented.  Some entities would like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replicate, but they cannot.  Most do not want to replicate, and attempt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to prevent others from doing so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a common theme explored in science fiction, where in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overpopulated world there are laws regulating the number of children.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A moderate form of this is supposedly already being practiced in China.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems to me that this would be a stable situtation, and one which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be adopted because it produces a better outcome for the participants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than they would get in a world of unconstrained replication.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is not obvious to me that constrained replication produces a betteroutcome,
<BR>
but even if it did, and even if creatures could coordinate to
<BR>
produce it, that still does not explain the existence of vast unused resources.
<BR>
<P>The key feature of that standard SF scenario is &quot;overpopulated&quot;, which
<BR>
seems to imply real resource constraints, which also seems to imply
<BR>
the desire to use available resources.  Restraining reproduction because
<BR>
of limited resources is one thing, restraining reproduction given abundant
<BR>
available resources seems quite another.
