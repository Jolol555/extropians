<EM>&gt; In the first place that depends on the arbitrary definition of how long

<EM>&gt; &quot;each stage&quot; is, so the statement is not useful. In the second place it

<EM>&gt; implies that there are special John Clark hydrogen atoms and special

<EM>&gt; Harvey Newstrom hydrogen atoms which renders the statement silly.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is an assembly of atoms that is necessary to the maintainance and stability of the
<BR>
ongoing emergent phenomenon that is my conciousness. Now, copying that conciousness by
<BR>
non-destructive or destructive means creates a conciousness on another substrate that
<BR>
beleives it is the first conciousness, however the only valid opinion on this matter
<BR>
ultimately is that of the original conciousness. John seems to be skating out from under
<BR>
the limits of this by either destroying the original conciousness in, i.e. destroying
<BR>
evidence, or by contesting that it doesn't matter, that its all solipsistic, that so
<BR>
long as we all can't tell the difference that it doesn't matter. While I would like
<BR>
reality to be as John describes, I have strong suspicions that it is not so, and that
<BR>
John's arguments are merely a cop out to avoid the issue, and is being smug about it
<BR>
because at this point in time, we cannot know one way or the other.
