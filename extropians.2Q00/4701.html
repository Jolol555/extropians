<EM>&gt; &gt; I do have a couple of friends that I am sure I could recognize by smell.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can identify all of my female companions by smell; every girl smells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slightly different.  It is like any other identity marker.  In fact, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that most people could accurately identify individuals they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intimately familiar with using any one of their five senses.  I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expect that the same applies to males, but I've never been in a position
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to know :^)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, going out on a limb, I've also noticed that ethnic groups as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whole have a characteristic smell that is not dependent on where they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually live.  In other words, a Japanese girl born and raised in New
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; York will have a similar type of smell to one born and raised in Tokyo,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but will smell distinctly different than, say, a girl of Mexican descent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In other words, it has always seemed to me that genetically similar groups
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of people have a similar and characteristic smell, although each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual in that group will have their own unique version of it.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wonder how much smell actually influences mate selection and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supports similar types of subconscious communication.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course this subject is going to be taken by the hypersensitive as bigoted or
<BR>
racist, no doubt about it...though nobody has said that such and so smells BAD.
<BR>
<P>I suppose this is associated with how many species parents keep track of their
<BR>
kids by smell. Human capacity for smelldentification is rather obvsiously
<BR>
limited, though animals like dogs, rodents, and so forth I beleive involve much
<BR>
more of their processing ability on smell. I would imagine though that this
<BR>
would be a pretty fuzzy biometric to use for identification, since diet, degree
<BR>
of sexual stimulation, and health also have an impact upon variance in one's
<BR>
smell.
