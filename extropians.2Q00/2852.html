&quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; says:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I had just started to get to know Sasha.  I read some of his ideas on
<BR>
his website, and communicated with him about something he wrote that
<BR>
delighted me via email once or twice.  We both lived in Cambridge and
<BR>
shared a sense of the absurd nature of some city political stuff.  I
<BR>
mainly felt I was getting to know him the unique way you know a great
<BR>
thinker through writings; you see a tantalizing glimpse of the wealth
<BR>
of ideas, and in Sasha's case good humor, fun, and joy.  I'm glad that
<BR>
at least once I told him how delighted his ideas had made me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Steve, Kathryn, I, and several other people all went out for dinner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; afterward, chatted about Sasha and basically had your typical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extropian/transhumanist type discussion. One guy was a dancing freind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sasha's and didn't know much about this side of him, but seemed very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fascinated with many of the ideas.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; But things seemed to be going so well. One good thing to come out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is that Steve Witham and myself have both decided to sign up with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alcor. ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I wish I had found you folks.  I left thinking that I will miss Sasha
<BR>
and remember him, and I will do more to fight such terrible tragedies
<BR>
among my friends, any way I can.  Like you, Perry and I spoke last
<BR>
night and resolved to get our suspension arrangements addressed.
<BR>
<P>All the best,
<BR>
James Wetterau
