<EM>&gt; Second, *to* Brian.

<EM>&gt;         Nevertheless, you've walked into a close-knit community (which does seem a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little cultoid, but that might not be bad). There's no way they won't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heavily slanted against you. That's why asses like 'altamira' and Doug Jones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel like they can chime in without have read the relevant posts-
</EM><BR>
<P>Bonzer, I don't know you from Adam.  I commented on the posts that I
<BR>
saw, which were deliberately inflammatory and confrontational.  Now here
<BR>
you come, calling me an ass for objecting to Delaney's unpleasant
<BR>
behavior.  Why should I change my opinion of Delaney, or form a positive
<BR>
one of you?
<BR>
<P>None of the excuses you give for Delaney are adequate- being &quot;*very*
<BR>
smart&quot; raises the bar, it doesn't forgive boorishness.  His belligerence
<BR>
reminds me of Speaker to Minerals- clever, but pointless and abusive.
<BR>
<P>You quoted altamira selectively-
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I didn't see the original posts on the Transhuman List which led up to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the discussion on this list, which deteriorated to personal name-calling,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;so I can't make any useful comments about the relative merit of the ideas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;being discussed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But I CAN say that .....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        When I read that I nearly fell off my chair. What gall! Comments like this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are pretty solid evidence that there's at least something cult-like about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this group. They are not interested in finding out what's correct they're 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interested in placing dissenters in a gulag.
</EM><BR>
<P>Her observation was on Delaney's style, not the content, to wit:
<BR>
<P>&quot;But I CAN say that it appears to be Brian D. who took it out of the
<BR>
realm of ideas into the personal.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From that observation you exclaim at her gall, call us cult-like, and
</EM><BR>
compare us to the perpetrators of the gulags.  I feel that dissent is
<BR>
fine, disagreement is fine- but deliberate calculated rudeness,
<BR>
namecalling, and use of manipulative rhetoric will get you little gain. 
<BR>
On an email list as in real life, if you enter a community where you are
<BR>
not known and cast aspersions on the locals, your credibility will be
<BR>
poor.
