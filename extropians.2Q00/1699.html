&quot;You folks&quot;? Come on, Mike! Why are you turning collectivist suddenly? Who 
<BR>
exactly are &quot;you folks&quot;? Are you including me? I'm British by birth, having 
<BR>
lived there for my first 23 years. I'm a quarter Irish by descent. And I'm 
<BR>
American by residence and by closest cultural identification. Am I one one 
<BR>
of those darned imperialist bad guys, or am I one of the good guys?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>You are evidence of a world that is blending together and getting more 
<BR>
&quot;multi-cultural.&quot;  I can see how Mike hit a nerve with what he wrote.  
<BR>
Obviously, people are truly defined not by simply where they were born, but 
<BR>
by the place they choose to live as an adult and the culture and paradigm 
<BR>
they decide to embrace.
<BR>
<P>But,,, going from England to the U.S. simply made you a different kind of 
<BR>
imperialist bad guy!!  You get different groups of people and nations to 
<BR>
dislike you now, without even knowing you!  But remember, Americans brought 
<BR>
those bad habits over from the old country and just ran with the ball!
<BR>
<P>I am according to my mother...
<BR>
25% Norwegian (so I can hate Germans for WW2!)
<BR>
25% Swedish (so I can be jealous of people from nice, warm climates!)
<BR>
25% Spanish (I can feel guilty about what has happened in Latin America over 
<BR>
the last four-hundred years or so.  I also can have have an excuse for a bad 
<BR>
temper and the need to chase women!)
<BR>
25% Irish (I can hate the English and have excuses for a bad temper, 
<BR>
fighting and any drinking problem, as well as the need to chase women!)
<BR>
<P>There is some German in there also so I can really resent myself over the 
<BR>
occupation of Norway!
<BR>
<P>Wait, I remember how in the _Star Wars_ series, the imperial officers had 
<BR>
British accents!!  Max, you are a bad guy!  But wait, your accent is 
<BR>
scottish, right?  Oh well...
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John
