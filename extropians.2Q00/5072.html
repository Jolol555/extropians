<EM>&gt;  Actually, I thought she was nauseous at the idea that women at GOP get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  togethers could be attractive....
</EM><BR>
<P>That was part of it. I am glad you caught the humor. ; ) 
<BR>
<P>And Mike,  I wasn't offended or anything. I just wondered what the heck you  
<BR>
thought slutty male information about GOP women would do for ME, a list 
<BR>
member. I know if you go to the Beverly Hills Polo Club you'll see good 
<BR>
looking republicans - a girl can go look at a rich young man in an Armani 
<BR>
suit too. But I wouldn't post it on the list so all the Extotopian girls 
<BR>
could find out and hopefully get laid. 
<BR>
<P>My point was: I wondered about your own personal filters, can you filter out 
<BR>
ANY thing, or do you just post all your errant psychological ramblings to the 
<BR>
list?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  You know, I don't go to GOP things anymore. Nah, I much prefer those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Libertarian meetings, full of smelly, sweaty, stubbornly offensive nerds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  yapping Randisms and whining about their capital gains taxes....
</EM><BR>
<P><P>For the record, that's what is blatantly offensive abotu LDC's comment.  
<BR>
There's no self awareness. I wonder if he ever looked in a mirror?
<BR>
<P><P>You are somewhat of a sexist Mike, but of the charming type who is also 
<BR>
chivalrous.
<BR>
<P><P>THANK you Mike, for having the intelligence and awareness to make fun of 
<BR>
yourself!!!
<BR>
<P><P>Peace, 
<BR>
Nadia
<BR>
PS: I will be offlist for awhile due to a heavy schedule, let me know if you 
<BR>
run across any interesting URLS ot topics.
