<EM>&gt; and returned smooth fonts to Internet Explorer while returning jagged
</EM><BR>
fonts
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to Netscape.  Their printer software used to grab the printer queue from a

</EM><BR>
among
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the Windows PCs until they were all finished before returning control back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the Novell queue for non-Microsoft clients to use.  Microsoft servers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used to prioritize web page requests and serving all Internet Explorer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requests before serving Netscape requests.  They also used to give false
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; error messages to Netscape browsers claiming that it could not read the
</EM><BR>
file
<BR>
<EM>&gt; type, when in reality it could, but the server refused to give it to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Netscape.  The original Windows used to refuse to let non-Microsoft DOSes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call some of their routines which they considered propriatery.  The Mac
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version of Excel was found to have timing loops that actually made it run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slower than the Windows version.  The disk formatter used to seek out OS/2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partitions and corrupt them.  The MSN network used to edit the CompuServe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and AOL prefs files and corrupt them.  MSN changed the format of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Macintosh control panel so that Microsoft products would work, but all
</EM><BR>
other
<BR>
<EM>&gt; products stopped working.  Microsoft claimed that all of these were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accidental programming errors.  They never could explain why they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; editing competitor's product files anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm curious why you are so convinced that all of these things were
<BR>
deliberate. The Netscape business seems somewhat credible, but the rest of
<BR>
it seems typical of the problems MS had in the late 80s / early 90s. They
<BR>
got overambitious with their OS development, found themselves facing all
<BR>
kinds of complex programming issues they didn't really know much about, and
<BR>
tried to fake their way through.
<BR>
<P>The result was lots of buggy software with weird, unpredictable behavior. I
<BR>
remember their applications division had some pretty serious problems too
<BR>
(remember when they had to do a recall/free replacement on Word, because the
<BR>
new version corrupted data?). I seriously doubt that they could have gotten
<BR>
these kinds of anti-competitor 'features' to work reliably back then, and
<BR>
they certainly couldn't have spared much manpower to work on them.
<BR>
<P>Now, they've gotten their act together in that respect since the mid-90s,
<BR>
and these days I'm sure they could pull it off if they wanted to. But why
<BR>
would they be that stupid? Every major compatibility issue generates tons of
<BR>
bad press, depresses their sales to users of the affected product, and
<BR>
convinces another fraction of the market that MS is some kind of evil
<BR>
empire. In the end they would only be hurting themselves, and these days
<BR>
they're smart enough to know that.
