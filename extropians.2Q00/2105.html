<EM>&gt;microwave oven type magnetrons ('boosted' of course) and some good sized

<EM>&gt;capacitors . Word to you: don't try to patent it if you are in the US. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;military looks on such ECM weapons as national security stuff, and will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;confiscate your patent application and any devices you have (been there, done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that). I recommend you simply sew as much stuff up in epoxy embedded boxes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chips, etc..along with use licenses in any sales.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hard to patent something with so much prior art, at least if you attempt to 
<BR>
do it within the spirit of the patent laws...
<BR>
<P>Our devices are lightweight and have a high rep rate. We use an inverter 
<BR>
and multiplier to charge up a fairly small capacitor and discharge it at 
<BR>
the natural firing rate of the cap, a spark gap, and a pulse forming 
<BR>
network. We get about 2000 W peak pulsed from the typical microwave oven 
<BR>
maggie. Pulse width is around 1 ms. The original request was from the 
<BR>
Border Patrol and the Coast Guard - needing a method of killing outboard 
<BR>
motors on fast smuggler's boats. They never pursued the query.
<BR>
<P>It's much more fun to use ex-WWII radar magnetrons and modern rare earth 
<BR>
magnets. Peak powers of 750 kW are pretty easy to obtain, and the whole 
<BR>
works fits into a standard tool box, weight about 8 kg. Operating time 
<BR>
using NiCd batteries is about 5 minutes of total output.
<BR>
<P>We've been issued a patent for the direct contact device - even sold a 
<BR>
couple to the Army and the Navy (!), but no orders came of it. We've sold 
<BR>
to the British Defense Ministry, the Japanese Police, and the Israeli 
<BR>
Police. The Japanese evidently could not figure out how to use the gadget - 
<BR>
they thought setting it on the hood of a stopped car would allow them to 
<BR>
stop the motor. I guess the cops over there just don't understand the 
<BR>
Faraday cage idea.
<BR>
<P>At present our patent is on the examiner's desk - another Beltway Bandit 
<BR>
outfit, Jaycor of Colorado, had filed a very bad clone of our application, 
<BR>
complete with misquoted physics - and that constitutes an &quot;interference&quot;. 
<BR>
So it's anyone's guess when or if we will win the fight there.
<BR>
<P>We have been through the unclassified areas of the Army Research Labs in 
<BR>
Maryland - the Army has lots of HERF stuff sitting around, apparently they 
<BR>
have abandoned directed microwaves as a weapon - at least publicly.
