<EM>&gt; Hi!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;A better question for the short term is to ask what is it about society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in nations where such things occur that not only causes or contributes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to this happening, but also what is that allows it to continue? We don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have such problems here in the US over any sport I know of.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problems with soccer fans have been solved in England (generally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered the most dangerous fans). By increasing security in stadiums
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and, most of all, by identifying hooligans and punishing them (either by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jail or by preventing them to go to games). In Italy or Turkey, on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contrary, authorities don't really want to solve these problems; my theory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that it's in their culture to support their teams in a very aggressive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fashion and authorities don't want to intervene. As for sports in the US, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agree there's much less violence; I remember watching an NBA game at NY in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which at the start of the game it was asked the public not to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aggressive language. Something I, as a Portuguese, find amazing; it can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happen for police officers to insult players from the away team in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Portuguese soccer matches! Anyway, in the US you have seasonal riots, high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incidence of violent crimes, etc. to compensate for a lack of violence in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sports.
</EM><BR>
<P>Seasonal riots? Really? Never heard of them. Do you mean riots in the big cities
<BR>
like LA once a decade??? Note that the social and legal systems in cities like
<BR>
LA are as opressive as any european country (and far more racist). Cities that
<BR>
don't have such oppressive laws have very european level violent crime rates,
<BR>
while few places in the US have property crime rates at even a small fraction of
<BR>
the huge amount over there in europe. Moreover, non-gun violent crime in europe
<BR>
pretty closely matches that seen in most of the urban US, while suburban and
<BR>
rural violence is far lower.
<BR>
<P>New York fans are considered the rudest and most offensive fans in the US (I
<BR>
recall all the Mariners/Yankees playoffs games I went to a 5 years ago, where
<BR>
New York fans were throwing garbage on the outfield..The Seattle fans wanted to
<BR>
go out and sort it for recycling...;) ), so if you were amazed at the goings on
<BR>
at a New York game, then you would be stunned at a major league game in most
<BR>
other cities.
