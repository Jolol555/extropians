<EM>&gt; &gt;      Smart guns will no doubt be a great deal easier to create than smart

<EM>&gt; mandatory safety training to engender responsibility in those who

<EM>&gt; I've got an idea!  Let's have another useless debate on the Extropy list!

<EM>&gt; That way we'll all bullshit for several weeks about this, insult each other,

<EM>&gt; and no one's opinion will change one iota at the end.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sound like a great idea?

<P>Daniel, we've been have a fine, civilized discussion about smart guns
<BR>
for the past week, without even Joes Dees messing things up, and I
<BR>
notice that even he is discussing politely, which give him a few points
<BR>
upward in my book, if he keeps it up he'll even come out of my trash
<BR>
can, which I will welcome.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to make a proposal that might change the course of the
<BR>
discussion:
<BR>
<P>I would argue that the best way to decrease gun abuse would be to
<BR>
re-invigorate people's sense of citizenship. I recall that the civics
<BR>
course in high school was a rather lamely taught course that dealt only
<BR>
in rote facts, didn't deal with discussion, development of policy,
<BR>
etc... I would propose that civics courses be moved up to junior and/or
<BR>
senior year, and passing with a grade of C+ or higher be mandatory in
<BR>
order to register to vote, buy a gun, etc., that the curriculum be set
<BR>
as a nationwide standard for national citizenship issues, and statewide
<BR>
to deal with state issues. THis makes the democracy a bit of a
<BR>
meritocracy, but I don't see that as a bad thing.
<BR>
<P>Doing this, you will get more teens thinking seriously about these
<BR>
things just as they are about to assume the actual responsibilities of
<BR>
citizenship, and they will be acting as examples for their younger
<BR>
peers.
