<BR>
<P>Ah, yes... The art of the British: understatements. !-)

<P>|The vast majority of efforts in progress are using Linux or other

<BR>

<P>The situation with wearables today looks like the hobby computer situation
<BR>
before the Big Blue started shipping the IBM Personal Computer iron.

<P>WARNING: TEXT BELOW MAY OFFEND OPEN-SOURCE'ICALLY CHALLENGED HUMANS.
<BR>
<P>&lt;RANT&gt;
<BR>
<P>Due to the flakiness and moby black magic of the Microsoft/Intel platform,
<BR>
I prefer to use LINUX for my wearable, where I have full SOURCE CODE available
<BR>
for everything.
<BR>
<P>The Microsoft/Intel may work for the Office robots and the computer gamers,
<BR>
but a hardware oriented cyborg will have enough struggling with the hardware,
<BR>
without having to beat their brows bloody against the software as well.
<BR>
<P>The venerable IBM PC platform (IRQ, I/O addr) still has to be fought,
<BR>
but at least the operating system software does not get in the way as much.
