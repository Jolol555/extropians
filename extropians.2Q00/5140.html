<P>
<EM>&gt;You may have heard by now about how the national missile defense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is all a big reaganesque fantasy, etc.  I was just wondering if anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;here has any strong opinions in this regard.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think the problem is the validity of their testing but rather
<BR>
the validity of their claims.
<BR>
I can't imagine them being crazy enough to do tests that have no
<BR>
validity at all, just for the sake of it. After all they do prefer to
<BR>
fight with things that work, which may happen to be the reason why they
<BR>
have to make false claims (to keep the money flowing in, for further
<BR>
devellopement)
<BR>
You also have to keep in mind that such a system could never work with
<BR>
just one type of weapon. One has to imagine several systems (For example
<BR>
what about laser weapons...) , probably each having some flaws, or weak
<BR>
points,  each taking down a certain number of weapons, ending up with a
<BR>
result as close to 100% as possible (just like carrier defence or air
<BR>
defence).
<BR>
Each system just like all other major weapon systems would continuously
<BR>
be improved once in service, and newer improved weapons would be built
<BR>
with the knowledge gained from the older weapons.
<BR>
Officialy the 100 interceptors proposed would only be capable of
<BR>
defeating a maximum of 25 to 30 warheads (and that probably includes
<BR>
some decoys). But then other systems are being developped and more
<BR>
interceptors have been proposed.
<BR>
What is amusing is how all this is being politically used by other
<BR>
states (especially Russia and China) to create tensions, between NATO
<BR>
allies. One has to remember several things.
<BR>
Even the Russians recognize that even with 1000-1500 warheads such a
<BR>
system would have no effect (the start treaty just signed by the
<BR>
Russians sets the limit at 3500 but the Russians still have about 20.000
<BR>
warheads stockpiled, which America is paying to destroy, with not much
<BR>
result it seems).
<BR>
The Russians and Chinese are both advanced in Laser defence systems,
<BR>
and  are cooperating on a Chinese system that has just been tested.
<BR>
The Russians already have an ABM system (currently ABM-3), as it so
<BR>
detabilised the world, as they claim an american system would? It is
<BR>
supposed to be only capable of defending Moscow, but if the Americans
<BR>
can defend a country with a limited system why can't the Russians?
<BR>
The Russians admit then deny that several countries are threats but at
<BR>
the same time they fully recognize that they provide most of these
<BR>
states with nuclear technology.
<BR>
All the research in these fields have yielded significant results that
<BR>
can be used for other applications.
<BR>
In addition to all this you have to remember that for a lot of people a
<BR>
nuclear weapon is still just a weapon and a nuclear 'war' just a war,
<BR>
which you have to make as 'winnable' as possible. Which is why hardened
<BR>
centers are built, and which is why the Russians have invested so much
<BR>
in the last few years in mobile launchers and hardened centers (more
<BR>
than 200 according to some estimates).
<BR>
<P>The system currently officialy proposed is a limited capability system
<BR>
designed more to avoid blackmail by certain unstable people rather than
<BR>
a system capable of defeating a major attack. In the same trend you will
<BR>
notice that there has been a lot of things going on (major exercices for
<BR>
example) related to reactions/avoidance of act of terrorim using WMD
<BR>
against the US.
<BR>
<P>What we are seeing is just a little show, and I hope you all appreciate
<BR>
it a such (For example I hope you all had as good a laugh as I did when
<BR>
it was revealed that Puttin's great proposition for cooperation implied
<BR>
that the system be deployed in Russia and not in the US, supposedly
<BR>
because they are closer to the 'rogue countries'.)
<BR>
All this talk about possible ABM systems is just like the fabulous
<BR>
revelation made a few years back that the US had 'invisible' aircraft
<BR>
(when in fact stealth aircraft had already existed for quite some
<BR>
years).
<BR>
I am not saying that the US has a capable ABM system already fielded,
<BR>
but neither do I say that the US has 'invisible' aircraft.
<BR>
