Subject: WTL: Announcement: Acton Line
<BR>
<P><P>************Announcement *************
<BR>
<P>ACTON LINE
<BR>
<P>Acton Line is a new British charity which has been established to send 
<BR>
money, food and practical aid to persons overseas - mainly intellectuals 
<BR>
involved in promoting human rights - who have been impoverished or harmed 
<BR>
through the actions of dictatorial regimes.
<BR>
<P>The charity is named after the famous British advocate of liberty, Lord 
<BR>
Acton, who famously wrote:  &quot;All power tends to corrupt; absolute power 
<BR>
corrupts absolutely.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The charity's first goal is to send help to human rights advocates and 
<BR>
others in Yugoslavia (Serbia) who, as a result of NATO bombing, are being 
<BR>
harassed, beaten, robbed, wrongly accused, falsely imprisoned, and roughly 
<BR>
interrogated and/or tortured by the secret police of the Milosevich 
<BR>
regime.  Many have been deprived of their livelihood, and even when they 
<BR>
still have jobs, many are not being paid.
<BR>
<P>These people face a real struggle to survive.  Often they do not know how 
<BR>
they will find food; food is often of poor quality or rotting; and when 
<BR>
they do have any money, it has to be spent on medicine for their injuries, 
<BR>
on hiring lawyers, or on repairs to their property from secret police 
<BR>
break-ins.
<BR>
<P>This sort of thing has always gone on, but as a result of the NATO action 
<BR>
it has become much worse.  Proponents of human rights are now labelled as 
<BR>
traitors and mercenaries, even when they have devoted their lives to 
<BR>
defending the rights of their fellow citizens.
<BR>
<P>Acton Line at present has five trustees:  a Chairman and organiser, a 
<BR>
legal advisor, a treasurer/financial advisor, a Church of England 
<BR>
clergyman. The fifth trustee is our local representative in Belgrade, a 
<BR>
member of the International Society for Individual Liberty, who has been 
<BR>
independently vouched for by sources in Sweden, Belgium and the USA.
<BR>
<P>If you would like to contribute to this cause, the simplest way is to send 
<BR>
money from your bank electronically to the Acton Line Treasurer's Account 
<BR>
at LloydsTSB, Hereford, UK.  The Bank Identifying Code is:  LOYD GB 
<BR>
21201.  Receipts for tax purposes will be sent via airmail, and can be 
<BR>
obtained by emailing your postal address to <A HREF="mailto:oldnick@wbsnet.co.uk?Subject=Re:%20Acton%20Line:%20Charity%20against%20oppression?&In-Reply-To=&lt;007601bfb11e$7b357760$a386ecd1@neptune&gt;">oldnick@wbsnet.co.uk</A>
<BR>
<P>If your bank needs the charity's account number, this can be emailed to 
<BR>
them upon request to the above email address.
<BR>
<P>The charity has received permission from the Bank of England to overlook 
<BR>
the NATO- imposed embargo on sending money to Yugoslavia as long as the 
<BR>
purpose is humanitarian aid.
<BR>
<P>It has been suggested that the IRS may not accept the charity's 
<BR>
receipt.  Whether this is true or not we do not know.  If anybody can 
<BR>
advise on this, the help would be gratefully received.  If anybody would 
<BR>
like to act as the charity's US representative and trustee, and register 
<BR>
the charity formally with the IRS, please let us know as soon as possible.
<BR>
<P>If anybody wishes further information, such as the names and addresses of 
<BR>
trustees, please get in touch.
<BR>
<P>Please forward this message to other lists.
<BR>
<P>Finally, Acton Line is deeply grateful to Kirez Korgan for allowing us to 
<BR>
use this forum for this announcement.
<BR>
<P>With best wishes,
<BR>
Nicholas Dykes,
<BR>
Chairman, Acton Line.
