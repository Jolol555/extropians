<P>
The John/Joan case catapulted Dr. Money to fame... and it was bad science
<BR>
from the start.  He started with a preconceived idea and altered his
<BR>
experimental data to support it.  He got away with it for almost 15 years.
<BR>
<P>It was used, not just by the &quot;feminist and poststructural `social
<BR>
construction' texts&quot;, but by anybody who had a vested interest in showing
<BR>
that gender identity is malleable.  The apparent truth is we are born with a
<BR>
definite gender identity.  Every  transgendered person knows this already
<BR>
and on a very personal level.
<BR>
<P>Dr. Money was also in charge of the Gender Clinic at Johns Hopkins and it
<BR>
was due to his recommendations that Johns Hopkins stopped performing sex
<BR>
reassignment surgeries on adults.
<BR>
<P>In the trans community, this story is already old hat.
<BR>
<P>The saddest result from Dr. Money's falsifying experimental data is hundreds
<BR>
of intersex children who had perfectly good genitalia mutilated shortly
<BR>
after birth and grew up being forced into gender roles that didn't match
<BR>
their gender identity.  Dr Money and his adherents created a whole
<BR>
generation of artificial transsexuals.
<BR>
<P>The truth came out about 3 years ago... but David just cashed in this past
<BR>
year with the book and guest appearances on several daytime talk shows like
<BR>
Oprah and Leeza.
<BR>
<P>You could have something in  your theory about castrati... but I haven't
<BR>
even been curious about those individuals.  Personally, I sing a passable
<BR>
bass.  Tenor is completely out of my range.  People did strange things in
<BR>
the not to distant past to one another for the oddest of reasons.  I'm not
<BR>
sure if ANY (let alone &quot;most&quot;) of the castrati were happy that they'd been
<BR>
castrated.  I'm pretty sure that most of them didn't choose... they were
<BR>
chosen.
<BR>
<P>OTOH, there is a subset of the bodymod crowd that are eunuchs by choice.
<BR>
I've met a few of those folk online and in real life... as well as many
<BR>
transsexuals.  Physical body type doesn't seem to correlate with choosing
<BR>
some form of alternative gender expression.  My understanding that sex
<BR>
differentiation of the brain occurs at a completely different time for a
<BR>
fetus than sex differentiation of the body.  There is some experimental data
<BR>
that suggests that male to female transsexuals have physically female brain
<BR>
structure... but it isn't conclusive due to the small sample size:

<P>Did I cover/respond to the points you were interested in Damien?
<BR>
<P>Onward!
