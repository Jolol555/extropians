<EM>&gt; The above is true, but again, irrelevant. My gripe is with the source of all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of this, the republicans. If they vanished, the problem would vanish, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as simple as that. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so. The republican movement is a symptom, not the cause
<BR>
of the problem. It's become a self-perpetuating symptom, true, and its
<BR>
extremists today arwe responsible for massively aggravating the situation,
<BR>
but at the time the movement got started -- in the 1960's -- it was a
<BR>
civil rights movement. And it had legitimate reasons for existing.
<BR>
<P>Those issues have mostly been addressed; indeed, fixing them was obvious
<BR>
vital -- from the point of view of the British government -- as early
<BR>
as the early seventies. (The original point behind the imposition of
<BR>
home rule in 197x was to pull administrative power in the province
<BR>
out of the hands of a group that was using it to institute systematic
<BR>
ethnic discrimination: unfortunately it came too late, coincided with
<BR>
the insurgency, and _looked_ like a dictatorial imposition of martial
<BR>
law.) The problem is, the political inequality of the 1950's and 1960's
<BR>
lent the republican movement a sense of injustice that fuelled what
<BR>
in Maoist doctrine is a stage 1-2 insurgency: make the populace *feel*
<BR>
aggrieved, then carry out one or two actions that force the government
<BR>
to respond by putting troops on the street, and you can generate a state
<BR>
of emergency quite easily.
<BR>
<P>In the 1970's, NI deteriorated into a situation where the perceived
<BR>
injustices generated a state of emergency, which fed upon itself. Every
<BR>
protestant or catholic murdered by a paramilitary group was a martyr who
<BR>
generated recruits for the para- militaries on the opposite side. Violence
<BR>
spiraled, feeding on itself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And so why are they causing this problem? Because they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want power, that's why - and feel that mob rule in NI and bombing of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; innocent men, women and children all over the UK is an honorable method of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; achieving this.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's about as honourable as the UVF's methods, of shooting protestants
<BR>
and catholics who marry each other. Of butchering people believed to
<BR>
sympathise with the republicans. Of treating *all* catholics as the
<BR>
Enemy.
<BR>
<P>The only difference between the two sides is that the UVF isn't interested
<BR>
in blowing up people on the mainland. Otherwise, they're both a bunch of
<BR>
bloodthirsty gangsters. The reason for this is that a leaderless insurgency
<BR>
splinters, and hands power -- the power to set the agenda -- to the most
<BR>
radical members of the movement. Those who are _not_ bloodthirsty gangsters
<BR>
are at the mercy of the gangsters; if they repudiate their actions, they
<BR>
lose any possibility of moderating them.
