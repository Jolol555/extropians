<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; in one sense the original IS the one-celled zygote, period.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thank you for a straight answer, but why period? Why stop there,
<BR>
why not go back until Harvey's parents were one celled zygotes?
<BR>
But hey, it's your definition, if you want to call that &quot;The Original&quot;
<BR>
who am I to argue. Now that I at least know what you're talking about
<BR>
I can form conclusions based on that. I conclude that the concept of
<BR>
&quot;The Original&quot; is trivial, dull, and utterly useless.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;If you don't like this, I assume it is  because you don't accept the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;zygote as being &quot;Harvey&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh it might have a weak claim to the Harvey title but certainly nothing
<BR>
unique, others would have a stronger claim to the throne. I suspect that
<BR>
even Harvey, that is the fellow who writes on this list, might agree with
<BR>
me on that point.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; I assume this is because you (reasonably) value the sense of identity
</EM><BR>
<P>Bingo.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;and don't believe that the zygote would be capable of this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;BUT the said zygote would (if it were lucky) grow up to be a  conscious Harvey.
</EM><BR>
<P>And the zygote might grow up and have conscious grandchildren, but they're
<BR>
not conscious now and neither is the zygote.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;The continuity of the space-time line seems to me to be the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;reasonable standard.
</EM><BR>
<P>The space-time line of what? Yesterday's potatoes that's what, because that's
<BR>
what you're made of.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;The copies may well have consciousness and continiuty of *memories* with
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the original they came from, and value their sense of identity/consciousness,
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;This still doesn't mean that they ARE the original.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't want to be &quot;The Original&quot;, I don't want to be like that stupid zygote.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;Yes but the pattern of the ensemble is reasonably constant,
</EM><BR>
<P>The difference between a zygote and the fellow writing this post seems
<BR>
rather large to me.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;and the  majority of atoms will remain at each stage for what it's worth
</EM><BR>
<P>In the first place that depends on the arbitrary definition of how long
<BR>
&quot;each stage&quot; is, so the statement is not useful. In the second place it
<BR>
implies that there are special John Clark hydrogen atoms and special
<BR>
Harvey Newstrom hydrogen atoms which renders the statement silly.
