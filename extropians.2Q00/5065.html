<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; I must say that for any of you guys looking for hot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; intelligent hetero women, the GOP is the place to go.  I met
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; more fine fine women at GOP wingdings than just about anywhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Can I throw up now? Mike, whatever possesed you to say such a thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in a public forum, where anyone can just look up the archives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have you no sense of respect?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What, we should be looking for ugly dumb lesbian tree-huggers?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know about you, but I certainly don't have the time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy, money, or inclination to become familiar with every woman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I meet.  Narrowing the search by generalizing personality traits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based on group membership, occupation, dress, or other criteria
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is perfectly rational and useful.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I thought she was nauseous at the idea that women at GOP get
<BR>
togethers could be attractive....
<BR>
<P>You know, I don't go to GOP things anymore. Nah, I much prefer those
<BR>
Libertarian meetings, full of smelly, sweaty, stubbornly offensive nerds
<BR>
yapping Randisms and whining about their capital gains taxes....
