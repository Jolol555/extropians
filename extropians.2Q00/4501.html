I might not be able to afford to take advantage of cutting-edge medical
<BR>
technology at some future time?  Possibly.  But there's a lot to be said for
<BR>
being healthier so that one's natural lifespan is increased in case the
<BR>
necessary medical technology isn't available for a while.
<BR>
<P>I'll let the snide reference to commune-dwellers slide for now, except to
<BR>
note that it's curious how you appear to look down on non-individualists
<BR>
such as commune-dwellers; yet you seem to value &quot;Belonging.&quot;. Did you truly
<BR>
mean no offense, or were you threatening to not let me hang around your
<BR>
fraternity if I don't spout the party line?

Subject: Re: Are you an extropian? Re: Voluntary simplicity
<BR>
<P><P>So how about any extros in the Seattle area pooling funds for bulk
<BR>
purchasing life extending substances and the like ?
<BR>
<P><P>============
<BR>
No offense, but from my point of view this comes across as something more
<BR>
likely to be heard from a commune-dweller in the 60s rather than an
<BR>
extropian. Committing to a lifestyle that you describe could put you at a
<BR>
big disadvantage when it comes to having access to new technologies. For
<BR>
instance, in the future you might not be able to afford some cutting edge
<BR>
medical tech that could extend your lifespan.
<BR>
<P>And again no offense, but spending your days tending your garden is not
<BR>
exactly helping you get closer to the days of posthumanism. For the
<BR>
individuals advocating or living such a &quot;static&quot; non-expanding lifestyle,
<BR>
I would like you to go over to extropy.org and re-read the principles.

<EM> &gt; Hey Brian,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I'd like to see more on this topic.  I've been living this way for a few
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; years now and have never been happier.  It's not that I wouldn't like to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; have more money--or, more accurately, to have more of the things money
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; buys--but the opportunity to savor each day fully is worth more to me
</EM><BR>
than
<BR>
<EM> &gt; the money would be.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; When I was in the process of making the decision to discontinue my urban
</EM><BR>
law
<BR>
<EM> &gt; practice and move to the country I pondered the lifestyle I'd choose if I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; had a nearly unlimited supply of money. I decided I'd live in the country
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and divide my time fairly evenly between gardening, study, and writing,
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM> &gt; enough social interaction thrown in to keep me from becoming a hermit (I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; tend to be a rather solitary person).  I realized I didn't have to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; accumulate a large sum of money in order to do this very thing, and I'm
</EM><BR>
now
<BR>
<EM> &gt; living a lifestyle that's close to my ideal. Perhaps if I had more money
</EM><BR>
I'd
<BR>
<EM> &gt; live in a mansion rather than a self-built adobe hovel.  But then again,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; maybe not...every square foot of my house was built for my own purposes;
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM> &gt; place fits me like a well-worn shoe, and it's been fun building it.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Did any particular event prompt you to investigate a simpler lifestyle?
</EM><BR>
My
<BR>
<EM> &gt; eyes began to open to wider possibilities when I spent a morning hanging
</EM><BR>
out
<BR>
<EM> &gt; with a woman named Donna.  She was one of those generally referred to as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;homeless&quot; although I don't think she would have characterized herself in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that way.  She'd found some pieces of lumber and sheet metal and built a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; shelter in a vacant city lot; she'd planted a little vegetable garden
</EM><BR>
there
<BR>
<EM> &gt; next to her shelter.  She told me that the night before she'd found some
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; lobster and shrimp in a grocery store dumpster and had invited a bunch of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; homeless people to share in her bounty.  &quot;I have so much,&quot; she told me,
</EM><BR>
&quot;I
<BR>
<EM> &gt; feel as though I should share.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; It occurred to me that overall, Donna's quality of life was higher than
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; mine, although she was jobless and I enjoyed a position in one of the
</EM><BR>
more
<BR>
<EM> &gt; highly paid professions.  Her days were her own; she lived by her own
</EM><BR>
clock
<BR>
<EM> &gt; and didn't feel constantly rushed by this or that deadline; and she felt
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; herself wealthy enough to indulge in charity. I'm forever grateful to
</EM><BR>
this
<BR>
<EM> &gt; woman, whom I never saw again after that day.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Meeting Donna didn't move me to take up a life on the streets, but I
</EM><BR>
began
<BR>
<EM> &gt; to give my thoughts a much wider scope in imagining possible futures for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; myself.

<EM> &gt; I am currently pursuing a more advanced state of what could be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; termed &quot;voluntary simplicity&quot; in pursuit of this goal.
