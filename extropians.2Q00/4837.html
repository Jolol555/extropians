<P>I saw a study done by a pretty cluey group that showed that
<BR>
corn could be grown, distilled, some of the alcohol used to
<BR>
run the corn processing machinery with plenty of alcohol left
<BR>
over to run internal combustion engines that are currently running
<BR>
on petrol.  The notion was that we could estimate the amount
<BR>
of land and water available and calculate a maximum possible equivalent
<BR>
price of fuel, regardless of the supply of petroleum.  They calced
<BR>
it was in the neighborhood of 6 bucks U.S. per equivalent gallon,
<BR>
and this was a few years ago, early 90s, and that with economies of
<BR>
scale it could only go lower.  This is expensive of course, but realize
<BR>
that this is the highest logical energy price we should ever expect.
<BR>
With the advent of hybrid cars, even a total loss or embargo of
<BR>
fossil fuel is not the end of high tech society as we so fondly know it.
