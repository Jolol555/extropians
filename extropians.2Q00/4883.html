<P>
I have to confess that biomass gasification is not of special interest to
<BR>
me, although I'm aware of some businesses that are using the process.  I'm
<BR>
far more interested in artificial photosynthesis, and although I'm not
<BR>
actively involved in the research, I try to keep up with it.  There are all
<BR>
sorts of exciting possibiilities, including the use of the photosynthetic
<BR>
process in molecular-scale computers.  I went so far as seeking permission
<BR>
from the University of Texas to do an inter-disciplinary, inter-university
<BR>
PhD program--my main faculty adviser would have been at UT, but the other
<BR>
committee members would have been at other universities.  But in the end, I
<BR>
decided against doing it, because I wanted to concentrate on the less formal
<BR>
research I'm doing here on my land.
<BR>
<P>In assessing the relative benefits of continuing as I am vs. becoming
<BR>
associated with an institution, I give great weight to the ability to use my
<BR>
time as I want to use it and to stay out of institutional politics.  My
<BR>
temperment is such that I become easily bored--I dislike doing meticulous
<BR>
lab work and would rather read someone's else's results than do the lab work
<BR>
myself. I think there's a need for people with a broad range of interests to
<BR>
read and understand research being done in various fields and to integrate
<BR>
the information. I've read and thought a great deal but have been lazy about
<BR>
writing things down.  Being on this list is showing me that I need to work
<BR>
on my communications skills and sharpen my wits.  (Thank you all)
<BR>
<P>As far as theoretical limits on the amount of carbohydrate that can be
<BR>
gleaned from solar radiation via photosynthesis, other than limits imposed
<BR>
by the sun's lifespan, I'm not aware of any limits over time.  There would
<BR>
be limits to the amount of solar energy that could be captured in any given
<BR>
space during a finite timespan, but the limits of naturally occurring
<BR>
photosynthesis could theoretically be pushed way up.  Only 1-2% of the solar
<BR>
radiation falling on a plant leaf ends up being stored by the plant (this
<BR>
varies according to the species of plant, temperature, concentration of CO2
<BR>
in the air, availability of N, etc.) . Since no one (at least as far as I
<BR>
know) fully understands the photosynthetic process, it's hard to say exactly
<BR>
what the limit would be.
<BR>
<P>What I'm doing on my land is testing the limits of what can be obtained from
<BR>
naturally occurring plants (and any genetically engineered plants I can get
<BR>
my hands on that do what I want them to do, which the ones currently on the
<BR>
market don't).  I'm looking to push down the mimimum amount of space
<BR>
required for indefinitely providing all the nutrients needed by a person,
<BR>
without using soil amendments, pesticides, or any other substance not
<BR>
produced on the land itself; and at the same time to see what's the minimum
<BR>
amount of work required to accomplish this. Since I'm gardening in sand, you
<BR>
might say I started from scratch.  I've had good results with unconventional
<BR>
techniques, such as planting annual and perennial vegetable food crops
<BR>
around the bases of nitrogen-fixing trees such as mesquite.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>P.S. Here's an interesting news bulletin about photovoltaics which use
<BR>
chlorophyll-like dyes (still in the research stage, as far as I know)

<P><P>This sounds fascinating to me. Are you working on 'synthetic photosyntheis'
<BR>
or biomass gasification? Can humankind and robot-kind produce enough fuel to
<BR>
power civilization? Is there a theoretical limit on what can be gleaned from
<BR>
solar radiation and converted to hydrogen or hydrocarbon?
