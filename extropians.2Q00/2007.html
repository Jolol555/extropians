<BR>
GLUTATHIONE PROTECTS AGAINST FLU
<BR>
Scientists from Emory University scientists reported at the Experimental
<BR>
Biology 2000 meeting that glutathione could aid in the prevention of flu
<BR>
virus if applied to the mouth and throat.
<BR>
Dr Jones stated, &quot;We believe that if we put the glutathione in a lozenge,
<BR>
we could directly expose the virus-susceptible tissues to glutathione over
<BR>
a relatively long period of time. This could be very helpful, for example,
<BR>
if you were sitting next to someone with the flu on an airplane. You could
<BR>
effectively block the infection for a period of several hours . . . There
<BR>
is a natural variation among people in resistance to viruses and in our
<BR>
natural antioxidant system. If we are smokers, if we are deficient in
<BR>
antioxidant vitamins, if we are under stress, or as we become older, we
<BR>
become more oxidized, which makes us more vulnerable to viral infection.
<BR>
This direct exposure to glutathione could be part of an overall strategy
<BR>
to enhance our antioxidant defenses.&quot;

<P>CALCIUM FIGHTS FAT
<BR>
At the recent Experimental Biology 2000 conference researchers reported
<BR>
that high levels of calcium may aid weight loss. Calcium appears to
<BR>
prevent fat cells' storage mechanisms from switching on. Conversely, diets
<BR>
deficient in calcium stimulate hormones that switch on the preservation of
<BR>
fat within the cells. 
<BR>
Acting upon results suggested by an older study of obese men, a team led
<BR>
by Dr Michael Zemel at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, tested four
<BR>
low calorie diets with varying levels of calcium on obese mice and kept
<BR>
one group on a low calcium, high calorie regimen.  Mice who received a low
<BR>
calorie diet supplemented with high levels of calcium carbonate lost
<BR>
approximately 42% of their body fat and one fifth of their weight,
<BR>
compared to a loss  of 8% body fat and 11% of body weight in mice who
<BR>
received a diet similar  in calorie content, but low in calcium.

HOW CoQ10 PROTECTS YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
<BR>
At least 35 controlled clinical trials in Japan, Europe and the U.S. have
<BR>
demonstrated the effectiveness of CoQ10 therapy in congestive heart
<BR>
failure, angina and ischemic heart disease, and myocardial infarction.
<BR>
A recent animal study demonstrates the potential of CoQ10 as a preventive
<BR>
therapy for atherosclerosis. Two groups of rabbits were fed a diet rich in
<BR>
trans fatty acids in order to provoke elevated cholesterol and
<BR>
triglyceride levels (hyperlipidemia). Later in the study, oxidants were
<BR>
added to the rabbit chow to provoke lipid peroxidation. The group of
<BR>
rabbits treated with CoQ10 displayed significant reductions in arterial
<BR>
plaque, with less than half the
<BR>
atherosclerosis score and plaque thickness in both the aortic and coronary
<BR>
arteries, compared to the control group. Measures of oxidative damage also
<BR>
declined.
<BR>
CoQ10 deficiency is commonly seen in patients with heart failure. The
<BR>
degree of deficiency corresponds to the degree of impairment in the
<BR>
function of the left ventricle. CoQ10 supplements may correct this
<BR>
deficiency noticeably in one to four weeks, and maximally in several
<BR>
months.  
<BR>
It has long been observed that CoQ10 improves the relaxation of heart
<BR>
muscle (in medical terms, diastolic function). Until recent years doctors
<BR>
thought that weak contraction of the heart muscle was the main cause of
<BR>
heart failure, but we now know that this becomes less true with advanced
<BR>
age. Aging affects the ability of the heart to relax far more than its
<BR>
ability to contract. When the heart muscle cannot fully and quickly relax,
<BR>
the heart does not fill properly with blood.  By age 70, the rate of
<BR>
filling may be only half what it was at age 30.

VITAMIN B-12 DEFICIENCY: A NEW RISK FACTOR FOR BREAST CANCER?
<BR>
Full source: NUTRITION REVIEWS, 1999, Vol 57, Iss 8, pp 250-253
<BR>
An increased risk of breast cancer was observed among postmenopausal
<BR>
women, having low levels of vitamin B-12. This is the first observation to
<BR>
suggest that B-12 status may influence breast cancer growth and therefore
<BR>
may be a risk factor for breast cancer prevention that can be modified to
<BR>
achieve positive results.

<BR>
Full source: NUTRITION AND CANCER-AN INTERNATIONAL
<BR>
JOURNAL, 1999, Vol 34, Iss 2, pp 173-184 
<BR>
Certain dietary components of plant origin may reduce the risk of prostate
<BR>
cancer. A study consisted of 617 cases of prostate cancer and 636 disease
<BR>
free individuals as controls from Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia.
<BR>
It found a decreasing, statistically significant association of prostate
<BR>
cancer with increased consumption of green vegetables (-46%), tomatoes
<BR>
(-36%), beans/lentils/nuts (-31%), and cruciferous vegetables (-31%).
<BR>
Higher intakes of citrus and non-citrus fruit were also associated with
<BR>
lower prostate cancer. Among the grains, refined-grain (white) bread
<BR>
intake was associated with a decrease in risk (-35%). However, whole-grain
<BR>
breakfast cereals were associated with a higher risk for prostate cancer.
