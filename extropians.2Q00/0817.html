<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;The ABA is a government supported monopoly.  Without the government to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;its power, it would face serious competition from law clinics (which it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;already does in some states of the US*), unlicensed lawyers, etc.  See,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;e.g., _The Rule of Experts: Occupational Licensing in America_ by S.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; David
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Young for other examples of businesses that use the government to avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;market.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;* Recently, the law clinic at some Louisiana law school was banned from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;helping people unless the people being helped could prove they made less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;than some minimum income standard.  The reason?  People were using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;clinic to sue one of the governor's supporters over, I believe, some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;pollution issue.  The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that this was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;practicing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;law without a license -- except in the case of the indigent.  In other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;words, the court protected the monopoly privilige of lawyers from an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;competitor.  (I believe this was on either &quot;60 Minutes&quot; a few months
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ago.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It's not really a &quot;monopoly.&quot;  The ABA does not have the exclusive right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; practice law.  The ABA in fact does not practice law.  It is merely a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; professional association of unrelated individuals who are licensed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; practice law.  It just so happens that the practice of law requires a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; license in every state in the union.  But that does not mean that lawyers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are exercising a monopoly any more than contractors, engineers, architects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or physicians or any other profession which you need a license in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; legally practice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>IN fact, Vermont does not now require that your attorney be a licensed
<BR>
attorney-at-law, so pleast get your facts straight.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Saying that lawyers have a &quot;monopoly&quot; on the practice of law is like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that licensed drivers have a monopoly on driving.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Licensing drivers is similar, but not the same.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Howso?  The ABA, like the AMA controls the number of seats in accredited law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; schools and also has input into the licensing process in each state as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as into the disbarring of members.  This gives it far more power than a mere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; professional organization like, say, the American Philosophical Association.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, unlike the ABA, the AAA cannot strip you of your license to drive,
<BR>
only the courts can do that. The NRA cannot strip you of your firearms
<BR>
permits. The IBEW cannot strip you of your electricians license either,
<BR>
so even if we compare union to union, the ABA is far more powerful than
<BR>
any other comparison except for possibly the AMA.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Licensing drivers is not the same in that one can learn to drive anywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the various driving schools do not control what's in the tests.  Nor do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they have power of revoking licenses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is not to say I agree with licensing drivers.  I do not.  Under a full
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privatization of roads (&quot;a&quot; and not &quot;the&quot; because there are many ways to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this), I'm sure, some critieria would arise for allowing people to drive on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; roads, though I doubt it would be close to current driver licensing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practises.  Nor do I think people would lose their driving priviliges on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given road or association of roads for the same reasons as they lose them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; currently.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a recognised constitutional right to 'freedom of transit' which
<BR>
was well recognised prior to the invention of the automobile. Even
<BR>
property owners who kep their property in the 'current use' tax class
<BR>
(the least costly) had and have to allow people to cross their land on
<BR>
marked trails on vehicles (snowmobiles, motorcycles, dirtbikes, etc) and
<BR>
freely on foot. The only basis on which licensing of automobile drivers
<BR>
is legal is that the state owns the land the roads are built on, the
<BR>
state has improved that land such that automobiles can reach high speeds
<BR>
to the point that automobiles become dangerous objects, threats to
<BR>
pedestrians, and as there is no annunciated right to drive automobiles
<BR>
(since they hadn't been invented yet, apparently, at the time of the
<BR>
revolution ;) )the courts are blithely ignoring the 9th amendment to
<BR>
maintain their control over the driving public. In the early days of the
<BR>
automobile, these restrictions were looked on as beneficial to the
<BR>
community, because so many people were fearful of the technology, and
<BR>
people were even afraid that you would die if you went too fast.
