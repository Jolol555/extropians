<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I would think that a non-commercial, altruistic expedition mounted by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; private sector would have many of the same problems as one financed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the government.  Since they don't have a commercial stake in the outcome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; but are just backing the project for PR or perhaps pure science reasons,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; they wouldn't necessarily be any more careful than the government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Maybe I am wrong and the private expeditions in question did have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; more of a commercial element?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I don't think so. I beleive that the reason is that the explorers had to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; raise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  funds for their expeditions, and only those whos reputations were 
</EM><BR>
considered
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  most competent got funded, while publicly funded expeditions leaders most 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  were staffed more by individuals who obtained their positions through 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  connections. A partisan leader of a government might decide that he needed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  good PR and put together funding for an expedition, but when it came to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choosing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  leaders, his partisan thinking would automatically eliminate anyone he 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  were not of his political party.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's a contrary example: The Lewis and Clark expedition.  It was publicly 
<BR>
funded during a period of EXTREME partisan politics and, at least in 
<BR>
Merriwether Lewis' case, the choice of the expedition leader was &quot;political&quot; 
<BR>
in the sense that the president (Jefferson) chose Lewis based on his personal 
<BR>
acquaintance with him (he was Jefferson's personal secretary).  Although the 
<BR>
conditions of the project weren't nearly as harsh in an absolute sense as an 
<BR>
arctic expedition, the scale and mission of the trip were in some senses 
<BR>
greater.  The goals of the mission were far exceeded and at a cost of only 
<BR>
one life.
<BR>
<P>Of course, the Lewis and Clark expedition was certainly the only one where 
<BR>
the president of the United States personally trained the expedition leader 
<BR>
in a number of scientific disciplines (astronomy, navigation, botany, 
<BR>
ethnography) in the White House library and in the Rose Garden, chose the 
<BR>
other scientific advisors for the project from among his own personal friends 
<BR>
who were the leading scientists of the day and personally designed and 
<BR>
selected much of the mission's equipment!
