<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds nice.  But the minute you hold the state to the same standard as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; individuals, the state gives up all police power (except in those few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; circumstances were governmental employees or property are harmed or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; threatened) and all prisons must be emptied.  That might sound like a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; thing to you, but the day it happens here is the day I move to Costa Rica.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, this is not true. The only greater authority police have that you a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't have is the ability to give traffic tickets, and in some states, arre
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; st
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for misdemeanor offenses. We are all authorized and responsible to apprehend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; criminals committing felonies, and in the face of threat of deadly force, wit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; h
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unarmed individuals present, lethal force is generally legal, though there ar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; e
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; differing thresholds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In New York State, Murder 1 (Capital) is reserved for killing a police
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; officer in the line of duty:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/cji/art12527.htm">http://www.courts.state.ny.us/cji/art12527.htm</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In New York City, the right to carry a weapon is so restricted that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; police are among the only people who can do it fairly automatically.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (The City Council are, too.)  The legislatures of New York City and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; New York State have thus created a situation in which a police officer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is both trusted with deadly force and protected from deadly force in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manner in which fellow citizens are not.  Then there are the kinds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guns and bullets police officers have access to -- &quot;cop killer&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bullets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe this imbalance can be disastrous, and leads to the worst
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible relations between the police and the public, but generally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the NYPD have supported (at least officially) New York's laws.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats a good reason why its the 'empire state'. They seem to think in
<BR>
those terms...
<BR>
<P>'cop killer' bullets are a misnomer and a matter of propaganda. Its
<BR>
perfectly legal for civilians to own and use body armor, but only cops
<BR>
can have ammo that can penetrate it? scuse me? That makes the ammo 'law
<BR>
abiding citizen killer' ammo. Moreover, body armor is only good for
<BR>
certain calibers, and there are different classes of body armor as such.
<BR>
A .22 hornet round can penetrate most vests used by police, while a
<BR>
5.7mm FN AP round can penetrate 45 layers of kevlar and titanium (note
<BR>
how this particular round is restricted to cops and military). The
<BR>
standard US .223 AR-15 round can penetrate all but the most modern and
<BR>
expensive body armor, and this is one of the most popular rounds
<BR>
available. Note that Rep Waxman is trying to get a 'sniper weapon' law
<BR>
passed that will not only outlaw all bolt action, semi automatic, and
<BR>
automatic rifles of .50 caliber or higher (it calls owners of such
<BR>
weapons 'threats to national security'), but the bill will give the ATF
<BR>
the authority to add on their own administrative initiative, any other
<BR>
calibers it feels are useful for sniper operations. Methinks that the
<BR>
good Congressman may be sweating a little that he wants to push the
<BR>
country too far and is worried about personal prejudicial
<BR>
repercussions...
