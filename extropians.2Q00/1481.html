<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; He goes into it later in the post. I personally can't dissagree witht
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  the logic either, even though I'm libertarian, I'm a libertarian of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  Spartan sentiments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This having to do with that amendment of the constitution which rules against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involuntary servitude except as a condition of punishment.  To which military
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conscription is &quot;winked&quot; at.  In other words....military conscription fits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the rules of involuntary servitude...but since it's in the best interests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the government for such to occur...it doesn't 'count'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In other other words...the constituition only applies when it's convienient?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ideally, serving your country is in your best interests, etc. (Remember:
<BR>
Whats good for GM is good for the country ;) ) since this is supposedly
<BR>
a participatory democracy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  A man who has nothing worth dying for has nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  worth living for, IMNSHO.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some people feel differently is suppose...or perhaps &quot;worth&quot; is an individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing instead of mandated by the state?  What was &quot;worth&quot; dying for in Viet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nam?  Who said so...?
</EM><BR>
<P>Anyone who thinks that their own life is more valuable than anyone elses
<BR>
doesn't obviously beleive in equality and all that stuff. Frankly I'm
<BR>
surprised at you. I personally think fighting against communism anywhere
<BR>
and any time is as close to a holy and noble cause as a libertarian can
<BR>
get.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps they didn't think much of that particular conflict? Who was trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invade?  How did it impact on Hoboken or Des Moines? Or perhaps there was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence of us being on the wrong side? I reference the history of french
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colonialism...the activities of said french during WWII and thereafter...and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; McNamara's autobiography.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; People who refuse to enlist or be drafted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;  ought to be stripped of citizenship, as far as I am concerned.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sounds like something out of a Heinlien Juvinile..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Your point is?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  I personally don't think that the baby boomer's general opposition to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the draft had much to do with principle, it was merely a snivling case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  of cowardice in general.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That seems mighty strong words..You've been there then?  Charged across rice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fields into enemy fire because ..........because of what?.......what was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gained?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems to me that avoiding the military altogether during that time frame
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was more &quot;honorable&quot; than being in the military but being in it in such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manner as to avoid all harm.  Kinda like the mafia is an &quot;honest&quot; crook while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a politician is a dishonest one...if you follow my analogy.  The principle of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it all.......
</EM><BR>
<P>If such people went to Canada and stayed there, fine. They were breaking
<BR>
their social contract, and the accepted duties of citizenship since the
<BR>
civil war. Good, stay out. If such people expected to stay here in the
<BR>
US after being so selfish? I don't think so.
<BR>
<P>I didn't serve in Vietnam, I did serve in the Air Force in the 80's and
<BR>
was in Panama for the fun. Understand this: I am a rugged individualist,
<BR>
but I would die for you. Get it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;Most of these kids had been told by their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  parents that their parents had fought WWII so that junior wouldn't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  to fight again, that kinda crap. Their opposition to the war had more to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  do with their personal opposition to being drafted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Personal opposition to being drafted seems reasonable...given what they(we)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were taught in civics class regarding &quot;involintary servitude&quot;...especially in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light of government corruption (ours and our allies) and the hypocrisy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; various government officials...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also since about age ten we were treated to the sight of fire fights on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Walter Cronkite at six  pm.  And just about every high school class had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recent graduates come home in a body bag.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Imagine that...a high school junior....who attends the funeral of a guy who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had only recently been a football hero?  Imagine seeing/ hearing of such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; funerals since he could READ!!
</EM><BR>
<P>So you admit it was based on fear.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some coward huh....to want to avoid that?
</EM><BR>
<P>How long the war was dragged out due to its pathetic management was a
<BR>
factor in public sentiment being demoralized. However I stick by my
<BR>
earlier statement, that you had a much smaller chance of being sent if
<BR>
you enlisted than if you were drafted. Draftees were getting drafted for
<BR>
one reason. In addition, of the 2.5 million sent, only 50,000
<BR>
casualties? Thats only a one chance in 50 of being killed. You have a
<BR>
greater chance of dying before age 39 in some useless and meaningless
<BR>
manner.
<BR>
<P>I'd heard of and been to funerals for kids killed in auto accidents
<BR>
since I could read, including a good freind of my own, who plowed into
<BR>
an oak tree at 95 with a blood alcohol of .35. They found most of him in
<BR>
the trunk of the wreckage.... It doesn't impede my willingness to drive
<BR>
in any way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or how about when he came &quot;home&quot;...but found that home wasn't there any more?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  And getting pelted by eggs and rotten fruit upon arrival....being called a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; baby killer...
</EM><BR>
<P>..by the sniveling cowards who were still home and didn't want to get
<BR>
sent there...I know, even though I served in the 80's, I've met a number
<BR>
of such pathetic losers who still are such rude assholes. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Calling someone a coward and &quot;sniveling&quot; seems contraindicated given such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data....
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see how.
