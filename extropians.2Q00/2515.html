<P><EM>&gt; I had previously written:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;John, has pointed out the points in my argument that I'm glossing over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The question is: What are the sources of mutation that lead to malignancy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(and perhaps aspects of aging)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(a) Radiation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(b) Oxidative stress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(c) Toxins in the cellular &quot;environment&quot; (derived from food).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(d) Mutations by DNA Polymerase in copying the DNA.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Thus, the engineering tradeoffs dictate that in a system as complex as a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cell, there WILL be bugs and weaknesses, but that they can't be prevalent or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; serious enough that most cells will succumb to them much of the time.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would argue many of the weaknesses are inherent in the system or perhaps
<BR>
local optima in the system.  The fact that you have a system that rapidly
<BR>
recycles any proteins that do not fold properly means that upstream
<BR>
mutations in DNA or mistakes in the manufacturing of the protein don't
<BR>
get propagated downstream.  Now of course, when you get mutations in the
<BR>
recycling machinery things start to come unglued...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Statistically, there is the tiny chance that one of the lethal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; variants of the signals will get through.
</EM><BR>
<P>At some point that must happen.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, as I'm vaguely recalling from the Sci. Am. article, cells also tend 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to go crazy when pushed somehow outside the normal operating parameters.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Most programs have this property.  Windows 2K goes bonkers when you push it to
<BR>
the edge of available swap space.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Koestler wrote about the DNA code being taped over - as with a piano with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certain keys taped over - such that only certain potentialities are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expressed.  As cells age, however, they tend to drift back toward a more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general expression - to become less differentiated, as the &quot;tape&quot; comes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loose at random points, until they conclude that somehow they are not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fulfilling their mission - or the demented version of it that now is the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controlling goal.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is Cutler's dysdifferentiation theory (which seems to have been developed
<BR>
circa 1985).  It sounds like Koestler is recycling it (do you have a ref. for that?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When cells conclude that they are not fulfilling their mission - or, more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concretely, when signals from the cell surround indicate that it is not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capable of meeting its programmed challenges, what is the response going to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be?   ...  To divide, obviously.  If one cell is not enough, then maybe a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; million will do the trick.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not clear.  Cells that divide are those that are always posed on the edge
<BR>
of division because division is what that tissue normaly does (or at least
<BR>
does in response to specific hormones, e.g. mammary glands).  There are
<BR>
many tissues in the body (consider ~300 different cell types), that
<BR>
are terminally differentiated.  You almost *never* get cancer in those
<BR>
cells because you require a lot more mutation to restore the program
<BR>
to a state where it is &quot;primed&quot; for division.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, what kinds of code correction systems keep these cells in line well 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beyond the normal limits, as we have been discussing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
The major ones I can think of are
<BR>
(a) the DNA repair process;
<BR>
(b) blocks on replication when damage is present (e.g. p53 gene &amp; friends);
<BR>
(c) apoptosis when things get really out of whack;
<BR>
(d) a patrolling immune system looking for cells that seem to have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;wierd&quot; proteins inside.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is it possible that one of the reasons for the apparent extended 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; youthfulness, etc., exhibited in the recent calve clones or some of the cell 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; culture experiments is due to the fact that the stable environment, with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only cells of the same kind present, made for a much stronger reinforcement 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signal pattern to the cells of each generation?  Instead of the chance of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stray signals from surrounding tissue or debris or viruses, etc., confusing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cell as to its identity and slipping through one of the programming 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; holes, each newly divided heart muscle cell received the unambiguous 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; message, &quot;you're a heart muscle cell...  you're a heart muscle cell...  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you're a heart muscle cell...  &quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>You never hear of &quot;cancer of the heart&quot;, precisely because muscle cells
<BR>
are terminally differentiated and multi-nucleated (meaning they have
<BR>
multiple copies of the program in each cell).  But I agree with the
<BR>
basic premise, that in tissue culture you have a much cleaner environment
<BR>
and are unlikely to receive any &quot;wrong&quot; signals from the guy down the block
<BR>
whose program counter is executing random code segments.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Thus, the normal correction procedures that keep a cell on track might use 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that unambiguous signal as a referent, and actually clean up a lot of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accumulated error.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe the current thinking is that most cancers requires the presence
<BR>
of a promoting signal and the absence of a restricting signal.  Then there
<BR>
are failsafes like telomeres and the immune system to try and &quot;catch&quot;
<BR>
the cells that elude those constrants.  The system &quot;works&quot; for ~75 years
<BR>
for about 2/3 of the population.
