<EM>&gt;This highlights the difference in perspectives:  Most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Americans on this list are Libertarians; they look at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gun &quot;problem&quot; in terms of an individuals need to protect him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or herself from intruders.  The common perspective in the UK
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is to look at the effect of guns on society as a whole,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without regard to the individual.

<P>Good post. Yes, this is about it. As I said to Hal off-list, what I found
<BR>
weird is the basic notion that a civilised society can take it for granted
<BR>
(apparently) that every household and member is in imminent danger of rape
<BR>
and death. And that the preferred way to deal with such a perilous
<BR>
situation is to threaten lethal-force mayhem back - even if it works, even
<BR>
if it's reached a kind of malign stand-off stability.
<BR>
<P>I do realise the general availability of firearms in the USA, which clearly
<BR>
can't be recalled this far down the track for all kinds of reasons historic
<BR>
and ideological, provides the basis for such a tragic Mutual Assured
<BR>
Destruction way of life (even if this is usually only droning away in the
<BR>
background outside the urban blights). 
<BR>
<P>I gather that in Oz some crimes of violence have increased after gun
<BR>
recall, but as far as I know there's less chance of death or major
<BR>
impairment when you're hit by a heavy stick or even a knife in a brawl or
<BR>
robbery. I have no figures on this, so maybe it's my wishful thinking.
<BR>
<P>The points added by James and John (this is getting very Biblical,
<BR>
appropriately I suppose) don't persuade me, but I do see their case. In
<BR>
principle, I'm aghast at the notion of vigilantes blowing away `trash'
<BR>
(partly because American and Australian whites both seem to have logged up
<BR>
quite a hearty score in dead black `trash' over the years). But I read
<BR>
enough Heinlein in adolescence to approve secretly of the idea of citizens
<BR>
assembled deciding that enough's enough and chucking sociopaths out of the
<BR>
airlock. And when I see egregious criminal scumbags roaming free, I wish I
<BR>
could reach for a gun and blow the fuckers away. And that's one reason why
<BR>
I'm very, very glad that I *can't* reach for a gun, in Oz, and by and large
<BR>
that neither will the scumbag...
<BR>
<P>I'm out of this discussion now. If I find any stats on the NRA claims, I'll
<BR>
pass them along.
