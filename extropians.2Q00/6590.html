<EM>&gt; &gt; An earthquake or storm large enough to break water systems is no small

<EM>&gt; thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *Lots* of bad things happen because of such an event, so the question is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which of those many things is as fault for disease.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When the disease is cholera and other diseases spread by contaminated water,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the culprit seems pretty clear.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you know of any study of such events which indicates that the extra deaths
<BR>
that they induced were relatively concentrated in water-borne diseases?
<BR>
Without such systematic evidence, all we know is that deaths go up when big
<BR>
bad things happen.
<BR>
<P>(Btw, in the short term the US mortality rate goes *up* .5% for every 1%
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the unemployment rate falls. See May 2000 QJE.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The world had lots of diseases as bad as AIDS:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera... gone now, and we live longer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...  I see major medical events, and I see a falling death rate.  It seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rather plausible that the stream of advances allowed the death rate to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;continue to fall,
</EM><BR>
<P>If the only data we had was steadily falling death rates and steadily
<BR>
increasing medicine, it wouldn't be inconsistent to attribute the former to
<BR>
the later.  But you couldn't really call that evidence for the position.
<BR>
<P>And we do have other evidence.  We see that variations in medical spending
<BR>
don't explain variations in mortality, and we even have a controlled
<BR>
experiment on the aggregate value of medicine (the Rand HIE).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;[Regarding <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4829a1.htm#fig1">http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4829a1.htm#fig1</A> ]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I also see, in the _next_ figure, causes of deaths in the US in 1900.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...  So eliminating deaths from pneumonia, tuberculosis, the water diseases,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and diptheria, would reduce the death rate by 31%. ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now, the CDC does have an interest in all this, but unless Robin wants to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accuse them of cooking the data, this seems good evidence of the utility of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;antibiotics and sanitation, and their connection with lower mortality rates.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes of course, death rates from infectious diseases have come way down
<BR>
since 1900.  I don't have to accuse the CDC of cooking those stats to question
<BR>
how much credit antibiotics and sanitation deserve for all this.  In fact, 
<BR>
since
<BR>
antibiotics didn't appear until after most of the drop in these diseases had
<BR>
already happened, it is pretty clear that antibiotics can't take most of the
<BR>
credit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But the claim that the increase in First and Second World life expectancy has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no known explanation, which Robin seems to be making, definitely hits the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bogosity filter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well now sonny boy, folks around these parts tend to take offense at
<BR>
being called &quot;bogus&quot;.  :-)
<BR>
<P>I'm not saying that we know nothing about why life is longer.  Just that
<BR>
medicine, sanitation, and nutrition can't seems to take credit for the bulk
<BR>
of the increase.
<BR>
<P>And if you want to stick with calling this &quot;bogus&quot;, I think you should feel
<BR>
some obligation to either look at some of the sources I've cited, or come
<BR>
up with some cites of your own.  I teach health economics here at GMU,
<BR>
and spent two years as a health policy postdoc at UC Berkeley, so I would
<BR>
hope you might give me enough benefit of the doubt to at least read a few
<BR>
things about this.
