<EM>&gt; Thought some of you might be interested in this.  (Sorry, if someone has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already sent it to this list.  I didn't see it on the list, but I miss a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heck of a lot -- which is probably a good thing.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One thing to do, for you pro-gun types or just people interested in seeing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less bias in coverage, is to write letters-to-the-editor when coverage seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; biased or call up your TV or radio station.  Sometimes these people do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respond.  I think that a lot of this bias is based on ignorance too.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;New York media and TV never respond. Even here, the local liberal
<BR>
paper, when I sent a letter to the editor calling them on their anti-gun
<BR>
bias, refused to print it because it was more than 500 words (which it
<BR>
wasn't). I trimmed it by 30%. They never printed it and have not replied
<BR>
to my queries. The only letters that papers like that will print from
<BR>
pro-gunners are those who are either demonstrably loony or are obvious
<BR>
religious conservatives, so that the only pro-gun views people will see
<BR>
are those who incriminate themselves in the eyes of the public by their
<BR>
writing.
