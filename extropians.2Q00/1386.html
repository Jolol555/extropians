<P>I appreciate what you are saying, but why focus on the past?   Why not form
<BR>
current analogies?   For example, Picasso and Braque were certainly Cubist
<BR>
superstars (actually it was Braque and then Picasso), but what have they to
<BR>
do with current art trends and applications?  Why not focus on
<BR>
Transhumanist Artists and Extropic Art and art modes created with digital
<BR>
tools, Artificial life, Artificial Intelligence, Nanotechnology -- whose
<BR>
work reflects themes of biotechnology, genetic engineering, Superlongevity?
<BR>
Referring to paintings and sculpture to reflect art on this extropian list
<BR>
is like discussing the light bulb to reflect technology rather than
<BR>
nanotechnology, AI, the Singularity or Uploads.

<BR>
<P>Well, I'm an old fashioned extropian.
<BR>
Long time ago I was shocked reading that ancient Greeks pictured the future
<BR>
in a different way. Ancients thought that we are walking backwards, so we
<BR>
cannot look at the future, because the future is behind our backs. We can
<BR>
just see the past, in front of our eyes.
<BR>
It's important to point out that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is not
<BR>
effective if we are interested in the past dynamics of a quantum object. So,
<BR>
even from this very peculiar point of view, the only thing we can see
<BR>
properly is the past, not the future.
<BR>
P.A.M. Dirac told me in Rome, in a very thin voice, that he too (as
<BR>
Einstein, de Broglie, Schroedinger) did not like the s.c. Born (or
<BR>
Copenhagen) interpretation of quantum mechanics. Einstein used yo say that
<BR>
&lt;the good God does not play with dice&gt;. Dirac said &lt;I must say that I also
<BR>
do not like indeterminism&gt;. In his opinion (Dirac's opinion was solid gold)
<BR>
that radical interpretation was not satisfactory and ultimate. Why? Mainly
<BR>
because the beauty principle was not fulfilled. Reference: P.A.M. Dirac, The
<BR>
Development of Quantum Mechanics, Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Rome, 1974
<BR>
Silvio Ceccato, philosopher, scientist and robot builder (1950), told me
<BR>
that &lt;in art the wait-and-think approach is a must&gt;.
<BR>
Emilio Segre', positron particle photographer and one of those guys working
<BR>
on the bomb (&lt;we worked like beasts, imagining the bomb falling exactly on
<BR>
Hitler's head, but U.S. Gov. took the other choice&gt;) told me interesting
<BR>
things about the art &amp; science argument.
<BR>
<EM> &gt;From Victor Weisskopf I learned that arts are changing in time, according to
</EM><BR>
society and culture. But - that's important - science progress, while art do
<BR>
not progress (I do not mean extropian art). Weisskopf was (to me) less
<BR>
convincing when he said that science changes a single phenomenon in a
<BR>
general form (law) and art turns a general experience in a single form.
<BR>
Reference: V.W., The Privilege of Being a Physicist, book, circa 1989.
<BR>
So I studied the Capestrano Warrior   <A HREF="http://www.muvi.org/musarc/f4.html">http://www.muvi.org/musarc/f4.html</A>   ,
<BR>
the Cubist Epoch (links to physics and philosophy), Mondrian's more and more
<BR>
abstract trees, Pollock's art (chaos, zen, Bohm's unbroken wholeness).
<BR>
But, who knows?, sooner or later I'd like to play some singularity
<BR>
five-senses time-reversed artistic performance.
<BR>
The times they are a-changin'...
