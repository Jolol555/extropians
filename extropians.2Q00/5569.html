</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My apologies if I offended you or any other who describe themselves as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;atheists. My error, I think, is due to cross definitions. It has always 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my understanding that atheism was the claim that &quot;God does not exist&quot; while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;agnosticism was &quot;we make no claim about Godhood&quot;. I again apologize for my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;misunderstanding. However, this not being the case, what then is an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;agnostic?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Well, I am not trying to start any kind of flame war here, and of course it 
<BR>
goes without saying that anything I say about atheists is not meant to be 
<BR>
cover all atheists. But, I have done a lot of reading about atheists and 
<BR>
atheism.
<BR>
<P>Regarding taking offense at anything you say or believe, I and I expect most 
<BR>
atheists would not take offense at your words. Your actions, OTOH, are 
<BR>
something else. As anyone can see, religion and religious people don't 
<BR>
hesitate to band together to force others to make concessions to their 
<BR>
beliefs. Recent posters on this thread have pointed out the various laws 
<BR>
that surround the Christian sabbath that affect everyone.
