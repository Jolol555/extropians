<P><EM>    &gt;To you, the original and the copy are identical.  You can't tell them apart.
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;Therefore you think they are interchangeable.  And they are, for your purposes.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not just me, the scientific method can detect no difference either, but
<BR>
nevertheless you insist there is still a vital difference of some sort.
<BR>
Sort of like the arguments I've heard from Catholics who say it may still
<BR>
look exactly like bread and wine after the ceremony but REALLY
<BR>
it's the body and blood of Jesus. I don't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;I can perceived the thoughts of the original &quot;me&quot;.  I cannot perceive the
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;thoughts of the new &quot;me&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course you can, you're both thinking the same thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;I can control the actions of the original &quot;me&quot;.  I cannot control the actions
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;of the new &quot;me&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course you can, you scratch your nose and you see the copy scratch
<BR>
his nose. Sooner or later (usually sooner) a random quantum fluctuation will
<BR>
happen or one of you will see or hear something the other does not and the
<BR>
two of you will diverge, but until then the two bodies will move and think in sync.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt; Not only can I easily tell the difference between the old and new &quot;me's&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course you can't.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;I could never get them confused.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course you can. I  put you two in a symmetrical environment and have a switch
<BR>
that swaps the input sense data that originated in one body and send it to the
<BR>
other brain. You can't tell when I throw the switch. I have another magic gadget
<BR>
that can instantly remove the brain from one body and put it into the other.
<BR>
You can't tell when I throw that switch either and neither can the other fellow,
<BR>
except that there isn't really another fellow, there is only you.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;The  original &quot;me&quot; is always here and is never disconnected.  The new &quot;me&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;over there, it is never connected.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know what that means.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;My perception of the old and new &quot;me's&quot; are  so radically different, that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;are not even similar.
</EM><BR>
<P>All the proposed mechanisms (except one) that attempt to identify the cause of
<BR>
this huge change, like something special about my atoms or something special about
<BR>
my position have been shown to be invalid, &quot;the original&quot; and &quot;the copy&quot; are not well
<BR>
defined concepts nor can they be used as distinct categories without inconsistencies,
<BR>
and the vague psycho-babble explanations for all this are so bad they're not even wrong.
<BR>
It's time to stop dancing around the issue, if you take it as an axiom that the original and
<BR>
the copy are somehow different, and admittedly most do, then there is only one
<BR>
conclusion, the religious people are right after all and we have a soul undetectable by
<BR>
the scientific method.
<BR>
<P>Obviously I can't prove (by the scientific method) that's wrong but I'm just not ready
<BR>
to surrender to the irrational.
