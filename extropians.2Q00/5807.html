<EM>&gt; Oh, well, in Germany, this is public oppinion. For a long time I was against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guns, too, but then I slowly began to doubt if this was the right choice. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't know of a politician openly advocating liberal gun laws.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; May I suggest www.nraila.org for more info.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks, that's just what I needed. I wonder if it would be possible to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organize such a lobby in Germany.
</EM><BR>
<P>I beleive there is an NRA affilliate in Germany.

<EM>&gt; &gt; We don't have a problem with the truth, the other side does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems so. But do you know how you can tell that a politician is lying? He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opens his mouth ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At least that's the case here in Germany.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its a genetic trait among lawyers (no, its a lifestyle choice). You can tell
<BR>
they are lying when they call the NRA an 'industry assocation' or 'gun industry
<BR>
lobby'. The NRA receives no money from gun makers, its membership (now 3 million
<BR>
and rising) are overwhelmingly common, working class, law abiding citizens.
<BR>
Anti-gunners have serious problems telling the truth, beginning with their
<BR>
claims to be 'reasonable', 'rational' people who do support the 2nd amendment
<BR>
(but only as they interpret it). They claim to not want to take away all guns,
<BR>
however they have been caught several times in the past admitting that this is
<BR>
in fact their goal.
