From: Charlie Stross &lt;<A HREF="mailto:charlie@antipope.org?Subject=Re:%20Death%20Penalty%20(was%20Re:%20Didn't%20need%20no%20welfare%20state)&In-Reply-To=&lt;000201bfaa4e$a5d16dc0$1510a8c0@pacbell.net&gt;">charlie@antipope.org</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt; Unless you take into account the possibility that he might be innocent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but wrongly convicted. Here in the UK, they've tightened up the appeals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and miscarriages-of-justice process a bit in the past few years, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; added DNA testing to the battery of forensic techniques available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The result is that roughly 10-15% of historic &quot;guilty&quot; verdicts are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being overturned, in crimes as serious as murder.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem with 'life in prison', is that nobody loses sleep when someone is
<BR>
sentenced to it.  There are people who are sentenced to life in prison, because
<BR>
they are frustrated by the legal system and resort to blowing away a bad guy.
<BR>
There are people sentenced to life on very little evidence.  But nobody cares.
<BR>
<P>But let a hardened criminal, with a rap sheet a mile long, get sententenced to
<BR>
death for killing and torturing a bunch of cute little kids, and all hell breaks
<BR>
lose.  A ton of lawyers and activists spring to the rescue.
<BR>
<P>Argh!
