<P>
Haven't finished reading this yet, but from the skim:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other hand, the title of Eliezer's article has an awfully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; top-down ring due to the word &quot;coding&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly guilty on the &quot;top-down&quot; part... that's the whole point of
<BR>
CaTAI, to present a functional decomposition of intelligence that
<BR>
enables us to actually *know what we're doing* as we write each line of
<BR>
code.  Of course, as a method, this is quite agnostic with respect to
<BR>
which layers of cognition are specified code, and which layers are
<BR>
trained concepts, or learned thoughts.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and his notion of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;codic cortex&quot; or &quot;codic sensory modality&quot; seems to swamp the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; usual notion of a sensory modality.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not extending the term &quot;sensory modality&quot; in any way whatsoever!  I
<BR>
am using it in exactly the standard sense!  Humans need to write code
<BR>
using abstract, conscious thought precisely because we do not have a
<BR>
codic cortex.  It's nothing intrinsic to code.  People who have their
<BR>
vision restored after a sufficiently long period of blindness need to
<BR>
reason consciously and abstractly about visual perceptions - just as we
<BR>
now reason abstractly about code.  It doesn't mean that vision, or code,
<BR>
is an intrinsically abstract task.
<BR>
<P>I again say that a codic cortex would perceive code.  Not write it. 
<BR>
Perceive it.  The visual cortex doesn't design skyscrapers.  The codic
<BR>
cortex doesn't write spreadsheets.
<BR>
<P>I should probably expand on the distinction in future versions of CaTAI.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I wonder how, using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Edelman's schema, one would select &quot;values&quot; for a codic sensory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modality without instantly facing all the difficulties of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traditional AI, and in an even more concentrated form than usual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (we don't want a robot that can just sweep the floor, we want a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robot than can write a computer program for a newer robot that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can program better than it does!).
</EM><BR>
<P>No, that's the ultimate goal of seed AI.  You don't need to bite off
<BR>
that chunk all at once.  First you code the modality, then you train the
<BR>
concepts, then you teach the thoughts...  The way to get an AI that can
<BR>
redesign its own source code is to start with an AI that can perceive a
<BR>
single function.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It seems like a bit of a leap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from &quot;Blue is bad, red is good&quot; to &quot;COBOL is bad, Java is good&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ;-&gt;.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's the trick - creating a codic modality that can perceive
<BR>
COBOL-style and Java-style as gestalt features of the code, as visible
<BR>
as the difference between a &quot;smooth&quot; texture and a &quot;wavy&quot; texture. 
<BR>
(Note that a blind human who regains vision late in life, or an AI
<BR>
without a visual modality, would need to reason consciously to
<BR>
distinguish between smooth and wavy...)
