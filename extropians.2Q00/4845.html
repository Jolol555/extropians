<EM>&gt;Subject: eliangate?

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;Its now come out, by Clinton Administration documents, that the administration
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was in full cooperation (i.e. conspiracy with a foreign power) with Cuba 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unfortunate Elian circus.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes perfect sense to me that if the child of a foreign national
<BR>
had been kidnapped from his father, and was being held under duress for 
<BR>
political
<BR>
reasons by a group with direct links to both criminals and terrorists,
<BR>
that the US should be co-ordinating with the home country's
<BR>
embassy.    If Elian had been, say, Israeli, and was being kept from
<BR>
his father in Tel Aviv by relatives and convicted criminals of a radical
<BR>
anti-Zionist faction of Judaism, would it be so odd for the US to be
<BR>
cooperating with the Israeli government?  Wouldn't you want the
<BR>
US embassy involved if *your* son were being held in a foreign
<BR>
country?   Maybe not, but I would.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People should have an absolute right, IMO, to live where they
<BR>
will, regardless of borders, if they can make a living at it.   But
<BR>
we generally make exceptions for children below a threshold of
<BR>
consent.  If Elian had been, say, 16, he could have petitioned to
<BR>
be considered an emancipated minor under US law and applied
<BR>
for asylum (which would likely have been turned down, as he was
<BR>
not in danger of persecution in his home country; rather the
<BR>
contrary).  As it is, the father had clear legal rights over the child.
<BR>
The relatives with records for armed robbery and drug dealing
<BR>
did not.  A good outcome to the case, I believe, marred only by the
<BR>
disgusting cold-war grandstanding of Al Gore, and the inexplicable
<BR>
hesitation of Janet Reno.
