3:20 AM,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Teachers are hardly low paid. The median teacher salary for a job that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only takes 3/4 of the year (and provides over a month of vacation during
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the school year), is above $30,000, for an annualized salary of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $40,000.00. Not bad at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>For a person with a Bachelor's degree, certification and a requirement to
<BR>
update their eduction every three years?  I was planning on being a science
<BR>
education teacher specializing in computer science.  I put myself through
<BR>
college doing programming on the side.  By the end of my freshman year, I
<BR>
was making more than the starting salary for teachers in Florida.  By the
<BR>
time I finished my sophmore year, I was offered a job paying twice what a
<BR>
teacher makes here.  I wrapped up my two years into an Associate's Degree
<BR>
and switched my major to Business Administration.  By the time I got my B.A,
<BR>
I was making triple what a teacher makes here.  A job is low-pay when it
<BR>
can't compete with other industries seeking the same skills.  Schools here
<BR>
get the worst students or the ones that are anti-money and take the low pay
<BR>
for altruistic reasons.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The only problem with the plan is letting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the NEA get to meddle in the curriculum. I would not accept a plain old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teacher for such an important job. Anyone who teaches such a course must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have training in constitutional law, be a veteran, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahhh....  I thought there was more to it.  I couldn't believe that you
<BR>
really would let a regular school teacher from the Liberal NEA rate students
<BR>
on their right to vote and bear arms.  This makes more sense.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The civics courses in this country have been gutted by the NEA et al
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over the past 40 years in order to make the population ignorant,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pliable, and easy to program with propaganda.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the real problem.  You want the state to have this sort of control,
<BR>
as long as you get to define what sort of teacher exists.  As soon as
<BR>
someone else replaces your teacher with their teacher, the system is no
<BR>
longer appealling.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since the Constitution is not a matter of partisan politics (anyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempts to subvert it is, in fact, committing treason), then there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be no such thing as 'buting the party line' by the kids. If they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to be enfranchised, they pass the course, just as if they want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drive a car, they pass a course. Don't like it? Why not? You folks are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arguing the same thing for carrying a gun. Majority rule has killed more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people in the last century than anything else.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  Majority rule is scary.  That's why I cringe at the idea that the
<BR>
right to vote or bear arms could be based on an education system that is
<BR>
controlled by majority rule (the state).  But where did you get the idea
<BR>
that the Constitution is not a matter of partisan politics.  Certainly the
<BR>
gun debate should have shown that there is not general agreement on what the
<BR>
Constitution says or means.  You are sure that your interpretation is
<BR>
correct and that the others are deliberately dishonest.  What you don't
<BR>
realize is that the others have the same opinion as you.  In such a
<BR>
situation, how could anyone agree on whose interpretation of the
<BR>
Constitution should be taught?
<BR>
<P>Your plan doesn't sound bad.  I just don't see how you can implement it
<BR>
using the state or its education system as a tool.  Such tools always
<BR>
degenerate down to the lowest common denominator.  Given our two-party
<BR>
system, we will never have agreement about what should be taught in schools.
