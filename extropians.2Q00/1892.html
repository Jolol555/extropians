<EM>&gt; Rather that simply railing against the closed-mindedness of people who are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mostly very old or dead now, I bring this up to make a point.  The key 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; element missing in the catalog of mental operations of most of the older 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generation - those now older than 60 - was the ability to think in terms of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems - complex feedback and control mechanisms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Taking a page from Papert's Mindstorms, those of us who were lucky enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work with real models of such - mainly computers - have no trouble at all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking in terms of systemic variables, but face a frustrating blank wall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of uncomprehension in trying to convey our insights to those who have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such concrete, experiential models in their minds.
</EM><BR>
<P>The way around that, at least in my experience, is to communicate the
<BR>
model as a preface to the data.  Sure, it takes longer than just
<BR>
communicating the data, but I've been able to get the concept of &quot;x at
<BR>
time t+1 is controlled in part by the output of x at time t&quot; across to
<BR>
people who barely understood the concept of &quot;1+1=2&quot;, without spending
<BR>
hours and hours at the task.  Make sure you understand the concept well
<BR>
yourself - a good excercise is to state the basic concepts to yourself
<BR>
in words an average child could understand - then focus the conversation
<BR>
on the details needed to communicate the point, and show new ideas as
<BR>
combinations of what the target already understands (including concepts
<BR>
only recently grokked during your conversation).  (Proceeding from the
<BR>
basics to the advanced, never ever delving into jargon or concepts you
<BR>
have not already defined, to yourself also makes good practice for this.
<BR>
It can also help you comprehend stuff you're not quite comfortable with;
<BR>
just break down info about it into such an explanation and repeat it to
<BR>
yourself.)
