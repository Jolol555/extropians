<P>I wanted to quote from Steve Jones' _Almost like a Whale_, but since I'm

away from it at the moment, I'll point you to a review of it:

<P>Darwin's belief in pangenesis was what I had in mind.  (I specifically
<BR>
recall a passage in which he suggested that an amputee would be
<BR>
statistically more likely to produce offspring lacking the particular
<BR>
limb.)  It was an understandable conclusion, from his strong insights plus
<BR>
a relative lack of information about related fields.  I think that Freud's
<BR>
ideas about female inferiority complex (&quot;penis envy&quot;) or fetish acquisition
<BR>
are misapplications of his theoretical perspective, but they're certainly
<BR>
understandable, and still more accurate than pangenesis.  But my primary
<BR>
point is only that Freud's underlying perspective (view the psyche as
<BR>
distinct modules, with their own sorts of values, and view human behavior
<BR>
in terms of internal conflict and internal communication between the
<BR>
modules) is both historically important and worthy of our study.  Probably
<BR>
because of their shock-value and humor-value, Freud's most bizarre
<BR>
conclusions have overshadowed his useful perspective on the mind.

great undertaking of the Enlightenment complete;

but the Beyond *inside* us has become a new heaven

and calls us to renewed heaven-storming.
