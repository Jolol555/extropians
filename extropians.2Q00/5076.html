<P>
I am going to have to clarify something. 
<BR>
<P>For some reason the MEN think I am offended at the word UGLY - i berely 
<BR>
NOTICED that word in their.
<BR>
<P><P>I did not react to that word, but to the QUEER bashing.
<BR>
&nbsp;the strign of insults was ( not necessarily in this order) &quot;stupid ugly 
<BR>
lesbian tree hugger&quot;
<BR>
<P>It's queer bashing, folks.
<BR>
The fact that it was about women made is greasier, but I would have objected 
<BR>
if he said &quot;tree hugging fags&quot; too.
<BR>
<P>I will not say much more on this, but most lesbians are not ugly or stupid. 
<BR>
At least not the ones in my acquaintance. In fact they are often extremely 
<BR>
cute athletic types who won't eat meat and are therefore in excellent health 
<BR>
of body and mind.  They simply do not meet with this guy's approval for 
<BR>
f**king (dont give me the line that he wants to breed and his genes are doing 
<BR>
it, I wont buy it) so he makes what is very close to racial/sexual slurs.
<BR>
<P>People call women DYKES just because they act differently from what society 
<BR>
wants them to. A strong women is not a dyke. A woman who doesn't shave her 
<BR>
armpits is not a DYKE, a liberal is not a DYKE. A CEO of a company is not a 
<BR>
DYKE. A democrat is not a DYKE. 
<BR>
<P>A dyke is a woman who falls in love with women. Repubicans or not.
<BR>
Get over it.
<BR>
<P>PS
<BR>
The manners thing comes up again, and repeatedly this man has used offensive 
<BR>
tactics of rudeness, crudeness and meannes to repel my posts.
