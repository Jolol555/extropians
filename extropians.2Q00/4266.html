<EM>&gt;  &gt; What I mean is the difference between someone watching a moon landing

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; In either case there is a delay, and even if you had instant (FTL) TV
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; signals from the moon to your TV in 1969 there still is no way that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; see that you actually are going &quot;back in time&quot; or causing any kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; paradox.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you're on Earth, or on Alpha Centauri, you don't see a problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But if you're in a spaceship heading from Alpha Centauri to Earth (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that's the right direction) at a relativistic speed, you'll see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the effect precede the cause.
</EM><BR>
<P>[snip]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, if they see the effect soon enough before the cause, they can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; send some information back to the cause, and prevent the cause from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happening.  But then how did they ever see the effect?
</EM><BR>
<P>Now - couldn't it perhaps work out that if this happened, their signal
<BR>
would never be able to reach the point of the cause in time to stop it?
<BR>
<P>In fact, doesn't it definitely work out this way, given that we already
<BR>
have multiple experiments demonstrating signals arriving before they
<BR>
depart which arrange themselves such that this effect cannot be used to
<BR>
practically signal back in time *to the same point in space*?
<BR>
<P>[snip]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree.  And that is why FTL communication must not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible.  Otherwise, you _could_ send a signal back that could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevent an event that has already happened.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have an idea.
<BR>
<P>What if a signal were sent, by the methods used in recent experiments,
<BR>
faster than light - but only a little so. Let's say the distance
<BR>
involved is one metre.
<BR>
<P>Normal light will take 3 x 10^-8 seconds to travel this distance.
<BR>
<P>A signal sent by one of the methods demonstrated can be arranged to
<BR>
arrive after a negative time delay.
<BR>
<P>Now, for some value of the signal velocity in between, the signal will
<BR>
arrive instantaneously.
<BR>
<P>An instantaneous signal cannot create a paradox.
<BR>
<P>Or, taking practical considerations into account, one arranged such that
<BR>
it was *almost* instantaneous.
<BR>
<P>My question: could we 'get away' with using these methods to send FTL
<BR>
signals for near-instantaneous communication over distances?
