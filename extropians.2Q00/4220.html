<P>| Since when does FTL imply instantaneous? There's still a transmission
<BR>

<BR>
<P>It doesn't - it implies a negative time cost (simultaneous being a 0 time
<BR>
cost).
<BR>

<BR>
| The assumptions you ask us to make enable the paradox. In the real world,
<BR>

<BR>
| happens safely after the first message was sent.
<BR>
<P>True, for now, but reality changes.  You can't expect an extropian to be
<BR>
limited by what is currently possible, can you?
<BR>
<P>|
<BR>
| All I see happening here is that you are substituting a long tunnel
<BR>
(&quot;delay
<BR>
| line&quot;) with a finite delay for actual space.
<BR>
<P>I don't think so, could you clarify on this?
<BR>
<P>The receiver and transmitter
<BR>
| could be sitting next to each other on a bench, or separated by light
<BR>
| years, it makes no difference.
<BR>
<P>True, though the assumption here was that they had some physical connection
<BR>
to the controller which enabled instantaneous (0 cost) communication with
<BR>
it.  The only FTL transmission going on was between transmitter (B/E) and
<BR>
receiver (C/F).
<BR>
<P>| Even if the transmission is instantaneous, the same rules apply. The only
<BR>
| way you get a paradox is to assume that the first message arrives at the
<BR>
| distant station far enough BEFORE it is transmitted so as to allow the
<BR>
| paradox.
<BR>
<P>Read (from the nyt article):
<BR>
&quot;That is so fast that, under these peculiar circumstances, the main part of
<BR>
the pulse exits the far side of the chamber even before (the term before
<BR>
suggesting, as Hal put it, an inertial reference frame) it enters at the
<BR>
near side.&quot;
<BR>
<P>|
<BR>
| You need a time machine, not FTL.
<BR>
<P>One and the same?
