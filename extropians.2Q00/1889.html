<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Sun have produced StarOffice, which is fully compatible with MS Office

<EM>&gt; &gt; and free for personal non-commercial use. It's distributed with several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the Linux distributions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah, but its not fully comparable, feature for feature. It only has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; file format compatibility.
</EM><BR>
<P>For one thing, I don't see why it should have to be feature for feature
<BR>
comparable. I said it was fully compatible, by which I mean it can read
<BR>
and write files in MS Office's formats such that users can use either
<BR>
with no hassle.
<BR>
<P>One of my gripes with MS Office (I'm not saying MS shouldn't be allowed
<BR>
to do this, it just annoys me) is the continual new versions. The vast
<BR>
majority of users never use 90% of the features (hence why StarOffice is
<BR>
a viable alternative for many - not that it's particularly lacking in
<BR>
features itself). As soon as businesses start to upgrade, files start
<BR>
circulating in the new formats, 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; (I would add Corel to that list, but their distribution is currently a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; little quirky - I look forward to the next version).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The 'quirky' comment I've heard elsewhere, mostly because the header
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; normally found in Debian is not present. It can be put back in with no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem, but the point of the Corel implementation was to make it easily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installable by a newbie on an average desktop machine.
</EM><BR>
<P>And this it does very well. Let me say that when I first saw a Corel
<BR>
system running I was *very* impressed - they had obviously put a great
<BR>
deal of work into making the interface consistent and easy to use,
<BR>
including writing a lot of their own software.
<BR>
<P>However, when I obtained a copy and tried the install, it had problems
<BR>
on quite a few machines, including some with quite basic common
<BR>
hardware.
<BR>
<P>I'm not someone who spreads rumours, and I'm not someone who acts with
<BR>
prejudice. Any comments I make are based on my own experience and
<BR>
knowledge. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There are issues with SCSI drivers, which is typical with many linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, true. SCSI is problematic for any OS installation because it is
<BR>
often not directly BIOS supported, and because of the vast number of
<BR>
different SCSI adapters available. Linux does indeed have problems here
<BR>
at the moment, because automatic hardware detection isn't yet as
<BR>
effective as that on Windows, and not every kernel driver can be
<BR>
modularised. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My impression that the 'quirky' comment is just a rumor spread around by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; die hard command line junkies who are offended that a linux install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be so easy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, give me a break. Yes, there are a lot of sad little twits who think
<BR>
they're so el33t for using Linux and don't want it to get into
<BR>
mainstream use because then they might have to go learn something else
<BR>
so they can still be k3wl. If you're unlucky enough to have had contact
<BR>
with them, I'm sorry. But please don't confuse them with the people
<BR>
who are actually contributing helpfully to Linux.
<BR>
<P>My comment that I use a custom-built system was intended to be
<BR>
informative in case you were wondering as to my choice of distribution.
