<P><EM>&gt; Brian, I have to say that your comments about anti-Semitism seem so far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off-base to me that I find it hard to respond. Your evidence for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-Semitism appears to be (a) that some people on the list argued that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumcision is a bad idea (apparently contrary to your religious or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cultural views); (b) that people have mentioned Ayn Rand's Jewish birth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; name (!!); (c) that libertarianism is inherently anti-Semitic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps it was the thread a few weeks back that included the term ZOG in
<BR>
the subject line.  I'm not sure if the people using it understood its
<BR>
meaning, and there was probably some subject creep.
<BR>
<P>ZOG stands for &quot;Zionist Occupation Government&quot;.  It is a term used for the
<BR>
U.S. federal government by the sort of degenerate creeps who think the
<BR>
&quot;Turner Diaries&quot; is great literature and claim the Holocaust was all a
<BR>
jewish hoax.  You might as well be waving a swastika.
<BR>
<P>I pointed this out at the time, even though I was not participating in the
<BR>
thread (or even reading it), but I didn't make an issue of it.  I'm sorry
<BR>
I did not, and will be more agressive about pointing out such things in
<BR>
the future.
