<P><EM>&gt; The Fingerprints Of A Secular Top?...No matter how wild this market action
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems, once again, this type of activity is not without precedent. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As you know, market periods exhibiting characteristic similarity are ones found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in historical extreme circumstances.  A week or so ago, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trotted out our &quot;return engagement&quot; chart for the price volatility surrounding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the '29 final top period.  There were a few days in the current market two weeks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ago that were dead ringers for a few days of activity directly preceding the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;final bell&quot; in 1929.  Well if you thought that similarity was eerie, what till
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you see what happens next:
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting to look at their chart from 1929:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inter Day Closing %, Intra Day Trading Range   
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/23/29    -6.3       8.0
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/24/29    -2.1      13.2
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/25/29    +0.6       3.5
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/28/29   -13.5      14.8
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/29/29   -11.7      18.5
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/30/29   +12.3      13.4
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10/31/29    +5.8       8.9
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11/4/29     -5.8       6.6
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11/6/29     -9.9      11.4
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11/7/29     +2.6      10.5
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11/8/29     -0.7       4.5
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11/11/29    -6.8       7.3
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11/12/29    -8.9       8.9
<BR>
<P>The middle column is the change in closing price, the right column is the
<BR>
difference between the high and low for the day.
<BR>
<P>This does have something of a resemblance to the last two weeks, at least
<BR>
on the NASDAQ.  Last week we saw 3 big drops, a little drop and a little
<BR>
gain, similar to the first five lines.  This week we saw two up days,
<BR>
big then small, then two small down days, broadly similar to the next
<BR>
four lines.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, at 9 days into the 1929 series above the index was
<BR>
down 30%, while NASDAQ is only down 20% over the previous nine days.
<BR>
That's a pretty significant difference, especially in terms of market
<BR>
psychology.  Also, although the NASDAQ gets a lot of publicity, the Dow
<BR>
industrials have not followed the above pattern very closely at all.
<BR>
The Dow is down only about 4% over the last two weeks.  Those big
<BR>
industrial companies add inertia and stability to the economy as a whole.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 6.     Are all the contrarian signs there for a meltdown in the broader tech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; groups?  YES   History shows that there has NEVER been an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instance where a financial mania or asset bubble has ended in any way other than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; badly.  There are no soft landings for asset bubbles. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Two things: first, it's not clear that this is an asset bubble.  People
<BR>
are trading in these companies in the hope of near-term gains, yes.
<BR>
But underlying these hopes, investors see long-term prospects for future
<BR>
technology growth.  Those companies that are blazing the trail into
<BR>
new technologies are the ones which investors hope will be the market
<BR>
leaders of tomorrow.  Calling it an asset bubble is really a matter of
<BR>
second-guessing the market, the collective opinions of all those people
<BR>
investing out there.  That's not an easy trick to pull off.
<BR>
<P>Second, as far as hard landings: through most of history there has not
<BR>
been the understanding that we have today of macroeconomics.  Yes, there
<BR>
is still much to be learned, and people do not always behave predictably.
<BR>
But at the same time we can't deny the effectiveness of the US Federal
<BR>
Reserve over the last two decades in moderating the business cycle and
<BR>
keeping the economy on a generally even keel.
<BR>
<P>Stock prices may fall and even crash eventually, but we should not expect
<BR>
a 1930s style depression as a result.  The economic policy mistakes
<BR>
of the time are well understood today.  There may be a slowdown as
<BR>
the excesses of the boom times get cleared from the system, but there
<BR>
is no reason to expect it to be particularly severe or long lasting.
<BR>
The demographic factors which are driving investment today will remain,
<BR>
and progress in new technologies will not stop.  There is still every
<BR>
reason to expect significant, possibly unprecedented, economic growth
<BR>
over the next few decades, based on technology.  Ultimately that can
<BR>
support very high valuations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 7.     Is the stock market rational?   From a long term perspective, the answer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is YES.   Short term movements are anything but rational.   The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market is an exercise in crowd behavior.  Today, it is simply an online study in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human nature. 
</EM><BR>
<P>What is &quot;short term&quot;?  The stock market has been overvalued by
<BR>
conventional measures for years.  Fed chairman Greenspan started
<BR>
expressing alarm about 1995.  It's tough to square allegiance to market
<BR>
rationality with the belief that for 5+ years the market has been
<BR>
foolishly caught up in an asset bubble.
