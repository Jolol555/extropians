<EM>&gt; Au  contraire, I think that it is CRITICAL that views are at least made in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such a way as to be not a direct affront to common mores and values of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; period.  Remember, most of us live in democracies.  Think of the issues in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Europe against &quot;Frankenstein foods&quot;, or here in the US with fetal tissue 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research.  The people you are looking down upon, i.e. the people for whom 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you are not considering their values, are the people who are having a strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; influence on what research can and can't be done.
</EM><BR>
<P>How can we watch what we say and still have a frank discussion about the
<BR>
issues which we find interesting and dramatic?  Think of Hans Moravec's
<BR>
scenarios, where super-intelligent AIs take over the solar system and
<BR>
eventually come back and transform the earth, outside of human control.
<BR>
<P>Should Moravec not have written up his ideas?  He was the foil used by
<BR>
Bill Joy to describe the risks of AI (or &quot;robotics&quot;, as Joy had it).
<BR>
If avoiding bad perceptions were the controlling factor, Moravec should
<BR>
have kept silent about his scenarios.
<BR>
<P>But then we would have lost a real treasure.  One of the most provocative,
<BR>
far-seeing figures would not have been able to stimulate our imaginations
<BR>
and sense of wonder.
<BR>
<P>And I don't believe that this can be resolved simply by putting things
<BR>
differently.  That suggestion reminds me of the comedy routine called
<BR>
&quot;Moose Turd Pie&quot;.  The punch line is &quot;It's good, though.&quot;  Trying to dress
<BR>
up our scenarios and disguise their apocalyptic nature is tantamount to
<BR>
saying &quot;it's good, though&quot; at the end.
<BR>
<P>IMO that suggestion would be a cop out.  It won't work and it will just
<BR>
tie people up in knots as they try to think of a way to put a positive
<BR>
spin on everything they say.
<BR>
<P>We can either be couragous and follow our thoughts wherever they go,
<BR>
or we can be politically correct and not say anything that would offend
<BR>
the Green party.  I don't think it will be possible to walk a line which
<BR>
straddles these positions.
