<EM>&gt;From: Brian Manning Delaney &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bdelaney@infinitefaculty.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Getting%20the%20facts%20straight&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000628003433.4518.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">bdelaney@infinitefaculty.org</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;P.P.S. Apologies to Zero Powers for the too general statement of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yesterday (or whenever it was). I hope you can appreciate that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone spending a lot of time thinking about anti-Semitism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recently might emit a typo or braino based on an unconscious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;assessment of the meaning of silence in this forum! (Even if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such a meaning is completely absent.) I mean, compare what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been said about me and my friends to my ONE-liner retort to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Natasah!!!
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure what you're apologizing for (and there's certainly no need to 
<BR>
explain) but apology humbly accepted.  If unsubbing from the list is what 
<BR>
you feel you need right now, that's cool and I can certainly understand.  
<BR>
But hopefully once things have calmed down a bit (in your heart and on this 
<BR>
list), you'll drop by again.  While I deplore flame wars, I do enjoy lively 
<BR>
discussion.  IMO lively debate is impossible without people who have 
<BR>
divergent viewpoints.  &quot;If everybody is thinking alike, somebody isn't 
<BR>
thinking.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I have another suggestion about list culture: We all know that irony and 
<BR>
good natured jesting do not always carry well by email and that the most 
<BR>
innocent turn of a phrase can unwittingly lead one into a flame war.  Since 
<BR>
there seems to be little we can do to stop this phenomena, and since we know 
<BR>
that misunderstandings and hurt feelings basically come with the territory, 
<BR>
I make it a personal philosophy never to attribute to malice what might be 
<BR>
attributable to folly.  So even though I am (unfortunately) still fully 
<BR>
human, and my feelings get hurt just like the next guy, I make it a point to 
<BR>
make every effort to let go of the bad feelings as soon as the active 
<BR>
&quot;hostilities&quot; are over.
<BR>
<P>So though tempers have flared and wagons have been circled, I would suggest 
<BR>
that if/when you come back that you act as though none of this ever 
<BR>
happened.  Hopefully my fellow denizens of this list will reciprocate and we 
<BR>
can get back to what we enjoy most...watching ourselves type.
<BR>
