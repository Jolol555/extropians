<P>
Every so often someone posts here complaining about how academics have no
<BR>
imagination, have no deep understanding, and ignore the most interesting
<BR>
topics.  After all, the evidence is obvious: the stuff we talk about is
<BR>
clearly terribly important, and yet academics seem to ignore it, and even
<BR>
go out of their way to denegrate it.
<BR>
<P>I think it helps a lot to understand why academics do what they do.
<BR>
For the most part it is not because they are stupid or lack imagination.
<BR>
It is mostly because they are using a winning strategy in the game
<BR>
they are playing: publish or perish.  Sure lots of people aren't willing
<BR>
to sacrifice their principles to play this strategy.  But a strong
<BR>
selection effect insures that they are a minority in academia.
<BR>
<P>A good way to understand any game is to read good strategy advice about
<BR>
it.  So a good way to understand the academic game is to read the
<BR>
good strategy advice found in: &quot;How to Publish in Top Journals&quot;
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.ag.iastate.edu/journals/rie/how.htm">http://www.ag.iastate.edu/journals/rie/how.htm</A>
<BR>
In particular see the &quot;choosing topics&quot; section of
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.ag.iastate.edu/journals/rie/howg.htm">http://www.ag.iastate.edu/journals/rie/howg.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Here are some especially relevant excerpts:
<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
21. Do not waste time on dead or dying topics
<BR>
<P>If your most recent references in a projected paper are ten years old, it
<BR>
will be difficult to publish it. It is a dead issue. Do not start such a
<BR>
paper (until you get tenure)!
<BR>
<P>If the most recent references closely related to your paper are 5 years old,
<BR>
it is a dying issue. Editors are reluctant to accept such papers, even if
<BR>
the referees recommend publication.
<BR>
<P>It is difficult for the editor to find suitable referees for outdated topics.
<BR>
<P>Your inability to find sufficient references indicates You have not read the
<BR>
literature.
<BR>
Others are not interested in the topic, hence, it is unlikely to produce
<BR>
output.
<BR>
<P>No problem! Dig further, or join a discussion group.
<BR>
If the work is completed already, cite some papers that are more recent.
<BR>
<P>22.  Do not write papers with breakthrough ideas at first
<BR>
<P>Avoid writing about your breakthrough ideas, at least in the early stage of
<BR>
your career, unless your mentor is the editor of a major journal.
<BR>
<P>Breakthrough topics are not often published.
<BR>
Wait until you get tenure to tackle breakthrough ideas.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I told my own young colleagues that they should preferably start off with
<BR>
the received wisdom with some changes until they get their tenure.&quot; -Douglas
<BR>
North, 1993 Nobel Laureate in Economic Science (see Nyaw and Yu, 1995).
<BR>
<P>If you do advance breakthrough ideas your papers will be rejected, and they
<BR>
might reappear in a modified, clearly written form from someone else later.
<BR>
<P>After you are established, perhaps you can tackle breakthrough ideas, and
<BR>
become known, instead of publishing many papers with minor ideas.
<BR>
<P>Or as you gain more experience, you may find that the ideas turn out to be
<BR>
trivial.
<BR>
<P>23.Extend existing literature
<BR>
<P>The bulk of papers published today are modifications of the existing
<BR>
literature or tests of existing theories.
<BR>
<P>Something in the paper must be original.
<BR>
<P>Duplication is not an extension of knowledge.
<BR>
<P>24.  Write something creative
<BR>
<P>A journal's primary goal is to publish original ideas.
<BR>
<P>A good journal is interested in disseminating new ideas, not in publishing
<BR>
papers that elaborate some existing ideas or examine the implications of a
<BR>
minor change in assumptions.
<BR>
<P>These papers only show that some results do not necessarily hold. Such
<BR>
efforts are basically a comment on someone else's paper.
<BR>
<P>25.  Mix ingredients of other papers
<BR>
<P>How does one extend the literature? Suppose there are two important papers
<BR>
in the literature.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p1 = {A, B, C, and D}, p2 = {C, D, and E}
<BR>
<P>where A, B, ... are ingredients.  Let pnew = {A, B, E} be a new paper.
<BR>
Does the new combination make sense? Does it describe an important economic
<BR>
phenomenon in a certain country or does it capture an interesting situation?
<BR>
If pnew = {A, C, X} where X is totally new, and if it makes sense, it may be
<BR>
an original idea.
<BR>
<P>Original papers add something new and dare to eliminate some old notions. Do
<BR>
not worry about compatibility with old papers.
<BR>
