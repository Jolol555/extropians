</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Morpheus' explaination might be looked at as a reflection of how well any opponent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; truly knows their enemy. Most conflict comes from misunderstanding, so it only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; follows that the resistance would have an imperfect understanding of their enemy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; especially one so vast as the AI.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The existence of the Oracle could simply be a user interface for a freindly AI that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has hacked the system to genetically engineer Neo. Remeber the warning about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 'indistinguisable from magic'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The Oracle predicted Morpheus' death, which was predictable given his lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; understanding of the enemy. As Sun Tsu said, the path to victory is by knowing your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enemy and knowing yourself. Neo attained a good degree of that understanding in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; end, which is why he was able to win in the end.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But she also predicted that Trinity would fall in love with Neo (long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before any of the storyline), that Neo would have to choose between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Morpheus' life and his own, that he would knock over the vase... yes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm willing to agree on 'sufficiently advanced technology'. But I just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prefer to do it differently, thanks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since all three were intimately jacked into the network, its pretty safe to assume that
<BR>
the Oracle had a pretty good pulse on the three to a much further extent than they were
<BR>
aware of themselves. Maybe Trinity has a groupie psychology, is looking for a savior
<BR>
figure, and the Oracle could see that, and used her by telling her that Neo would be that
<BR>
savior. The interesting thing about prophesy is that people who beleive in prophesy tend
<BR>
to make realty move to conform with that prophesy.
<BR>
<P>Remember, the vase was in virtual reality, though even in regular reality, its not hard
<BR>
to hypnotize someone into doing exactly what you tell them to do so long as it isn't
<BR>
something they had no objection to anyways. Talk is a very powerful tool, its why women
<BR>
prefer romance novels, they are easier to hypnotize as well.
