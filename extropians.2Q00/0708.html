<P>Not so fast.  Arrow's Impossibility Theorem would not hold if, in deciding 
<BR>
what was socially preferred, we could accurately compare degrees of 
<BR>
preference.  Suppose, for instance, that we could say not only that Able 
<BR>
prefers apples to oranges to bananas, but that he prefers them by three and 
<BR>
two utiles, respectively, whereas Baker prefers oranges to bananas to apples 
<BR>
by five and two utiles respectively.  Clearly, that small society's utility 
<BR>
function is maximized by choosing oranges.
<BR>
<P>That's just utilitarianism, and as such suffers the usual objections, most 
<BR>
relevantly that we cannot make interpersonal comparisons of utility. You 
<BR>
could (per Alfred Marshall) simply treat as equal each person's utility from 
<BR>
having one more dollar.  That's clearly false, but it may still prove useful 
<BR>
for purposes of approximation.
<BR>
<P>The short of it is that both votes and dollars fail to overcome Arrow's 
<BR>
impossibility theorem, but that votes almost certainly fail in a more 
<BR>
spectacular fashion.
