<P>
James Rogers and Mike Lorrey wrote stuff about the socially calming
<BR>
benefits of gun ownership in response to my comments about:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; a bunch of soccer thugs in Britain 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; They just lerrrrved smacking and bashing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; the shit out of other people. Their blood was up, it boiled with rage and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; delight, they had flow and peak experience. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I foolishly ended this post with a throwaway remark about personal weaponry.
<BR>
<P>The guys said:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Perhaps populations that &quot;pack heat&quot; have more evolved level of maturity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; or at least personal responsibility, than those that don't.  One thing is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; for certain: broadly armed populations definitely select for these traits.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;An armed society creates an implied threat that shuts up loudmouths,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tones down the emotionally heated, and essentially spontaneously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;organizes a polite society.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that's a relief. And here I was supposing that I'd drawn attention,
<BR>
by analogy, to something deeply worrying about a future where, say,
<BR>
nanotech minting provides much of the essentials of life very cheap or
<BR>
free, where AI displaces most of the brain-based jobs, and where many
<BR>
healthy young people will be stressed by the lack of extrinsic meaning in
<BR>
their otherwise comfortable lives.
