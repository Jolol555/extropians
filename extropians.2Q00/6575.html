<P>
In this respect (...people who have been practising for decades...) I know
<BR>
of a handful of sixties+ folks who were followers of old-time nutrition
<BR>
gurus like Gaylord Hauser... they're vegetarians; eat delicious, filling,
<BR>
but low-cal stuff... and really look good.
<BR>
<P>These are not particularly educated people; but they did seem to make a
<BR>
decision three or four decades back that LE (...or what passed for the
<BR>
concept back then...) was definitely worth it.
<BR>
<P>In outlook they're curious; love life; are lusty people with a sense of
<BR>
humour and a perspective (...rightly or wrongly..) of their place in the
<BR>
universe...

<EM>&gt; CYMM SAYS: With all due respect, such people might be primarily marketers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certainly they have been reaping appropriate benefits. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Their lives may have been extended, their physical appearence is about that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of people of average age (old hippies). They used to promote on the Merv
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Griffin show, but aside from the usual bullshit artists, Durk seemed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;knowlegable in the sciences regarding energy and spaceflight, which were
</EM><BR>
more
<BR>
<EM>&gt;interesting at the time to me.
