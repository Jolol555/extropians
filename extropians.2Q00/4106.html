<EM>&gt; &gt; They are certainly many scenes in the movie that do not correspond to hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; science, nor to precedence within the movie.  When Trinity shoots the agent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on the roof, she says &quot;dodge this&quot;, why does he not?  Well that it did not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It actually goes beyond this.  Why do any of the agents bullets ever miss?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>That is a very good point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems that the agents have virtually unlimited processing capacity at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their disposal but limited bandwidth into the Matrix, less apparently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than even the humans.  Clearly the agents aren't a physical part of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Matrix, otherwise they would be able respond almost instantaneously to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rapidly changing event streams in the Matrix.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that, or they could nuke the block.
<BR>
<P>It appears that in large part the agents were subject to the ruleset.  The
<BR>
possible exception is that they could move ot any representation of a human
<BR>
output, a form of possession, where they also appeared to retain their form and
<BR>
accoutrements upon possession.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One thing that is clear from the movie, and which may have ramifications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the sequels, is that there seem to be several very large systems in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existence with Matrix-class computational abilities, all of which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loosely interconnected.  These systems appear to be quite capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running one or more AIs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The movie shows a basic human versus machine conflict, but it seems to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that this is only because the movie was written from the perspective of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans there.  I suspect that the larger picture includes several different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; players, most of which are not human.  Certain aspects of the plot seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggest this, almost to the extent that the humans are pawns in someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else's game.  For example, the humans in aggregate may very well have more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aggregate bandwidth into the Matrix than the parties that actually control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Matrix.  An enemy of the current owner of the Matrix may have an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interest in helping the humans subvert the Matrix if it has damaging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequences to the owner.

<P>Yes these are issues which we might surmise but not yet know.  There is not an
<BR>
established ruleset.
<BR>
<P>In the story, the Oracle character had the ability to prophesize, that's of note
<BR>
as another issue for intepretation.
<BR>
<P>One way to look at is that the Matrix is based upon technology not created by the
<BR>
robots, which hijacked it but were unable to alter its fundamental nature.
