<BR>
<P>&lt;No it has nothing to do with your lifestyle. In fact I have a definite
<BR>
admiration for anyone who can live in such a strongly individualistic and
<BR>
self-sufficient manner. What set me off was that somehow I did get the
<BR>
impression you were considering yourself to be an Extropian. I did a
<BR>
rant on another post about how I feel about that. Sorry for any misunder-
<BR>
standing.&gt;
<BR>
<P>I think what set ME off about your posts was that I sensed a demand for
<BR>
self-sacrifice, particularly when you seemed to offer a choice between
<BR>
comfort (which I interpreted as encompassing self-interest) and progress.
<BR>
I've just re-read Eric Hoffer's _The True Believer_, which I was motivated
<BR>
to do because I had become acquainted with a person who was a member of the
<BR>
Church of Scientology (I believe that's what they call themselves), which
<BR>
has all the trappings of a mass movement.  What disturbed me about your
<BR>
posts was that I was seeing in them evidence of the same sort of selfless
<BR>
devotion to holy cause as I had seen in my Scientologist friend, although
<BR>
the doctrines of Scientology and Extropy (Extropianism?) are of course quite
<BR>
different.  One of Hoffer's points is that all mass movements share certain
<BR>
characteristics, regardless of their respective dogma.
<BR>
<P>To better illustrate where I was coming from, here's a quote from _The True
<BR>
Believer_:
<BR>
<P>&quot;When our individual interests and prospects do not seem worth living for,
<BR>
we are in desperate need of something apart from us to live for.  All forms
<BR>
of dedication, devotion, loyalty and self-surrender are in essence a
<BR>
desperate clinging to something which might give worth and meaning to our
<BR>
futile, spoiled lives.&quot;  Hoffer is using the word &quot;spoiled&quot; here to convey a
<BR>
sense of hopelessness rather than as we would use the word when speaking of
<BR>
a &quot;spoiled brat.&quot;
<BR>
<P>He continues: &quot;Hence the embracing of a substitute will necessarily be
<BR>
passionate and extreme.  We can have qualified confidence in ourselves, but
<BR>
the faith we have in our nation, religion, race or holy cause has to be
<BR>
extravagant and uncompromising.  A substitute embraced in moderation cannot
<BR>
supplant and efface the self we want to forget.&quot;  &quot;Substitute&quot; in this
<BR>
context refers to a substitute for self-esteem.
<BR>
<P><P>&lt;You are right here too, and that is certainly not my belief. But what
<BR>
are you planning to do with your research results? What comes next?&gt;
<BR>
<P>My most immediate purpose for doing what I'm doing is to please myself.  I
<BR>
want my gardens and orchards to exist, and since they didn't exist before,
<BR>
I'm working to bring them into existence.  It's that simple.  What comes
<BR>
next depends to a great extent upon events that are not under my control.  I
<BR>
see the present political and economic situation (world-wide) as unstable.
<BR>
If you like mathematics, there's an interesting paper by physicists Anders
<BR>
Johansen and Didier Sornette (UCLA) on the web. Their models show that &quot;both
<BR>
the acceleration in the growth of the world's human population until the
<BR>
1970's as well as in a proxy for capitalistic expansion {my note:  they use
<BR>
monthly DJ quotes for this purpose} in the United States since its creation
<BR>
as a nation until present are consistent with a spontaneous singularity at
<BR>
the _same_ critical time 2058 AD plus or minus 5 years.&quot; I don't have the
<BR>
URL handy, but I'll find it for you if you're interested in reading the
<BR>
paper.
<BR>
<P>In any event, I don't feel as though I, or anyone else, can predict the near
<BR>
future with any degree of certainty. Singularities imply changes that can't
<BR>
be predicted by interpolating the past. Therefore, I must answer that I
<BR>
don't know for sure what next, but I feel confident in my ability to handle
<BR>
whatever comes.
<BR>
<P>As far as social benefits of my research, having cultivars of food crops
<BR>
which can be grown on poor soil (or on concrete for that matter) with a
<BR>
relatively small input of labor and without the use of fossil fuels could
<BR>
mean the difference between life and death. I see organizations such as
<BR>
Monsanto and the USDA going in the opposite direction; I know with a high
<BR>
degree of certainty that the foundations of their agricultural technology
<BR>
are quite fragile.  Because I stated that I enjoy what I do and have fun
<BR>
doing it (and even that I grow flowers, god forbid!), you may have concluded
<BR>
that I was like a commune-dweller of the 60's (the phrase conjures up images
<BR>
of hippies with flowers in their hair amid wreathes of marijuana and opium
<BR>
smoke). This is not an accurate view of who I am or what I'm doing, and I
<BR>
felt resentful that you jumped to that conclusion.  I don't think it was
<BR>
warranted, based on the information you had access to.
<BR>
<P>You said with respect to not paying taxes:
<BR>
<P>&lt;I certainly understand this motive myself, and I am also trying to limit
<BR>
my taxes. But I don't see it as a good reason to head to the hills. At
<BR>
least if I get fed up with this government I can easily move to some
<BR>
other more comfortable country. In my opinion your lifestyle has put
<BR>
you even more at the mercy of the government- you might find yourself
<BR>
unable to relocate so easily. From my point of view, developing larger
<BR>
(not smaller) amounts of financial resources allows me a greater
<BR>
chance to escape. Or if I choose, it allows me to support organizations
<BR>
that might help reform or protest the government. Basically in my view
<BR>
having more cash is a good thing (in general), and giving up your cash
<BR>
is bad (in general).&gt;
<BR>
<P>I agree with you that in many cases money can buy freedom, time, life
<BR>
itself. I have no quarrel with your decision to pursue it (aside from the
<BR>
fact that in acquiring the money you're probably supporting a destructive
<BR>
political system).  I would ask you to pay me the same consideration by
<BR>
acknowledging that you aren't aware of all my circumstances and that it's
<BR>
possible that my choice may be the most logical and life-sustaining one for
<BR>
me.  Rather than store money, my choice has been to concentrate on gaining
<BR>
knowledge, skills, and flexibility.  My opinion is that THESE will be far
<BR>
more valuable than money in times of rapid social change. I wouldn't be able
<BR>
to concentrate on acquiring these and on doing the research I'm doing if I
<BR>
were spending 40 or more hours per week making money. As I've also said, I'm
<BR>
trying to figure out a way to make more money without giving up things I
<BR>
value more highly.  But the non-monetary assets I listed above have higher
<BR>
priority for me than the money at this time.
<BR>
<P>&lt;Sure, I support ExI and Foresight, each has received $10k from me so far
<BR>
with more coming soon I hope. I am now supporting Eliezer's AI/Singularity
<BR>
research indefinitely. I spend most of my time researching investment
<BR>
strategies and opportunities both in public and private companies. In
<BR>
my previous life (1997/98) I founded and sold Hypermart.net, which helps
<BR>
small businesses get started on the Web. Since then I helped start an
<BR>
angel investing group in Atlanta that has helped many startups here get
<BR>
help. I have many public and private investments, and as these grow I
<BR>
intend to continue to (hopefully) divert larger and larger quantities
<BR>
of cash to the above and other extropian/singularitarian efforts. I will
<BR>
be 26 years old on Saturday. Someday I may start another business if
<BR>
I become motivated enough, but for now I am content to let my money work
<BR>
for me.&gt;
<BR>
<P>This is certainly impressive, Brian.  And BTW, Happy Birthday and may you
<BR>
have a long and happy marriage! And if I might offer you a gift from the
<BR>
perspective of middle age:  don't ever stop creating, whether it's
<BR>
businesses or music or books or new technologies.  Letting your money work
<BR>
for you is fine in my view (as you might guess from everything I've said),
<BR>
but don't ever let your mind get lazy. Regardless of what technology is
<BR>
developed to keep the body young and healthy, youthfulness of outlook
<BR>
requires  a vigilant exercising of the mind, learning and creating the new
<BR>
and wonderful.
<BR>
<P>And now I think I'm going to recede into lurkdom for a while.  I've been
<BR>
spending entirely too much time sending posts to this list.  You guys are an
<BR>
interesting group of people, that's for sure!
<BR>
