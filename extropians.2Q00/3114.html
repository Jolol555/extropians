<P>&lt;&lt;  Kurzweil is a bright guy and a good programmer but that
<BR>
&nbsp;hardly qualifies him to prognosticate that we (or SIs) can change the
<BR>
&nbsp;laws of the universe.  In fact if you read in detail all of the work
<BR>
&nbsp;being done on keeping Moores Law going, it becomes clear that
<BR>
&nbsp;we *are* getting closer and closer to the limits.  And as I
<BR>
&nbsp;point out in my MBrain discussions, the speed of light places
<BR>
&nbsp;a fundamental limit on who &quot;smart&quot; you can get.  Planck sizes
<BR>
&nbsp;place fundamental limits on how small you can get.  Gravity
<BR>
&nbsp;places fundamental limits on how dense you can get before you
<BR>
&nbsp;*disappear* from this universe.

Are you saying that your 'qualifier' for this discussion is limited by a 
<BR>
doctorate in physics? Wow!  As for gravity, these *dense* matter thingies 
<BR>
called, black holes, seem to stick around for quite a while-astronomically 
<BR>
speaking--and now appear to come in different masses; which was somewhat 
<BR>
unexpected, theoretically. Lightspeed gets beat by non-locality, though any 
<BR>
useful data I have heard, is impossible. However, since Gerald Feinberg back 
<BR>
in 1962 postulated the existence of tachyons, maybe centuries from now 
<BR>
something less *dense* then what people are now may come up with a really, 
<BR>
decent, technology that utilizes these hypothetical particles. Maybe Freeman 
<BR>
Dyson's universe will ultimately get interconnected via tachyons rather the 
<BR>
lasers or neutrinos or whatever? The funny thing is that somehow, I suppose, 
<BR>
there is just a lot more information, in the cosmos, waiting to be uncovered 
<BR>
and some of that information will be good news for humans and our descendants.
