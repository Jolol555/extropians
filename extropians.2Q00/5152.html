<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I would not be so quick to give up on communism.  It has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;adulterated by those modern regimes who now call themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;communist, and its true that current conditions probably do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lend themselves to an effective form of communism but, eventually,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I believe Marx will prove to have been on to something good.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Yeah, all you need is a transparent society controlled by a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;totalitarian regime, and populated by robots.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually I was thinking more of a society of people enlightened enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; realize that what's good for the whole is good for the individual.  It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; simply a matter of realizing that the surest way to keep your neighbor from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stealing your bread is to be sure that he has enough to keep his own belly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; full.  I call it &quot;enlightened self-interest.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately such a society is unlikely to be stable for long as long as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there is not enough to go around for *everyone*.  But hopefully that minor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; problem will soon be solved by the good folks over at Foresight :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With nanotech, you don't need to give a hoot what your neighbor is doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to feed himself. And what is good for the whole is most decidedly NOT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good for the individual. Its good for the whole if the clothing industry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only needs to make one style of clothing, and the most efficient design
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is this nice brown Mao suit. Its obviously good for the whole if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone wore Mao suits all day. Where is yours, Zero? Lead by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike Lorrey
</EM><BR>
<P>And a hat, too, you must wear some kind of Mao hat.  But if you got feet too big,
<BR>
or fat mattresses, or wear golden underwear, Communism just don't fly.
<BR>
<P>On a small scale of like minded individuals, such as some forms of communes,
<BR>
Communism, to the extent that the members share the efforts of sufficiency, has
<BR>
been seen to succeed, although there are plenty of failed communes.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps the most regular example of a sufficiency requirement sharing unit is the
<BR>
nuclear family.  Yet, for almost any supporting members of any of them, to
<BR>
support someone not related who they do not know is not likely.
<BR>
<P>There never were any communist states, only statist states claiming communism.
<BR>
Was Stalin a Communist?  More died in Stalin's purges than in the concentration
<BR>
camps, although that is a distasteful comparison.  I have no idea how many
<BR>
Chinese are dead since the Revolution.  Is Cuba a Communist state?  It might be
<BR>
the closest example to one.
<BR>
<P>With nanotech, it's going to be more of the same, societally.  Perhaps in the
<BR>
near future the means of sufficiency will be even more available to all then they
<BR>
are today, so that we will return, to some extent, to the hunter-gatherer social
<BR>
life, of up to four hours a day on sufficiency related activities, and the rest
<BR>
for social, entertainment, and enlightenment activities.
<BR>
<P>Plainly put, there is plenty to go around for everybody, but the people who have
<BR>
it don't give it away for free, and if they did there wouldn't be enough.
<BR>
<P>There is enough for everyone on the planet to have a meal each day.
