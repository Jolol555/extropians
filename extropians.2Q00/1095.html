<EM>&gt; &gt; Where did you get the 300,000 dead from? The figure I'm working from is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 60,000 US soldiers dead -- putting the USA in roughly fourteenth place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the conflict. (Citation: &quot;The First World War&quot;, Martin Gilbert.)

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is as I recall from school. I could be wrong, and I might have mixed that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up with WWII losses. In any event, even accepting your figures, that would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more losses in less than two years
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, in those eleven months. IIRC, the *first* American casualty of
<BR>
the war -- excluding those Americans who lied about their nationality to
<BR>
join the armed forces of a European nation -- happened in January/February
<BR>
1918. Pershing wasn't planning on *any* US military involvement on the
<BR>
ground prior to 1919 -- his hand was forced by the near-collapse of the
<BR>
French in May/June 1918 during the German's last big push.
<BR>
<P>The US army on the ground in June 1918 had about 300,000 soldiers *total*
<BR>
(although by June 1919 that was due to be up to about 2 million, at which
<BR>
point it would be as large as the British expeditionary force).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;                        ...... All of this on something that really had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing to do with us.
</EM><BR>
<P>Except for the fact that at the end of the conflict, the whole balance of
<BR>
trade and power among the great powers would have changed. By getting 
<BR>
involved, the USA had the opportunity to dictate some aspects of the 
<BR>
outcome -- in its own favour. 
<BR>
<P>(This isn't a _good_ reason for jumping into a world war, but it's a 
<BR>
realpolitik reason.)
<BR>
<P>This also leaves aside the then-current issue of &quot;Hun beastliness&quot; and
<BR>
the rape of Belgium, which was what got the UK into the war -- if the
<BR>
German army hadn't violated the borders of a neutral country, the UK might
<BR>
well have stayed neutral, leaving the war to play out in 1914 as a replay
<BR>
of 1871.
