For anyone who has doubts about the genome running a variety of
<BR>
&quot;programs&quot; (which *are* imperfect), they should take a look at
<BR>
a paper this week in Science:
<BR>
<P>Resetting Central and Peripheral Circadian Oscillators in Transgenic Rats 
<BR>
Shin Yamazaki, et al, Science 288:682-685 (2000).
<BR>
<P>Abstract:
<BR>
In multicellular organisms, circadian oscillators are organized into
<BR>
multitissue systems which function as biological clocks that regulate
<BR>
the activities of the organism in relation to environmental cycles and
<BR>
provide an internal temporal framework. To investigate the organization
<BR>
of a mammalian circadian system, we constructed a transgenic rat
<BR>
line in which luciferase is rhythmically expressed under the control of
<BR>
the mouse Per1 promoter. Light emission from cultured suprachiasmatic nuclei
<BR>
(SCN) of these rats was invariably and robustly rhythmic and persisted for
<BR>
up to 32 days in vitro. Liver, lung, and skeletal muscle also expressed
<BR>
circadian rhythms, which damped after two to seven cycles in vitro. In
<BR>
response to advances and delays of the environmental light cycle, the
<BR>
circadian rhythm of light emission from the SCN shifted more rapidly than
<BR>
did the rhythm of locomotor behavior or the rhythms in peripheral tissues.
<BR>
We hypothesize that a self-sustained circadian pacemaker in the SCN entrains
<BR>
circadian oscillators in the periphery to maintain adaptive phase control,
<BR>
which is temporarily lost following large, abrupt shifts in the environmental
<BR>
light cycle.

<BR>
<P>Gives new meaning to the concept of our clocks &quot;unwinding&quot;.
<BR>
Also makes me wonder about the self-experimentation I'm doing
<BR>
with periodic 12-hour time zone shifts...
<BR>
<P>Ah well,
