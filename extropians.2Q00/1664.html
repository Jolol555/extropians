<EM>&gt; I don't see that it is necessary at all. Willing or not, if the
</EM><BR>
alternative
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is starvation the slackers will go out and work. The only tricky part is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ensuring that the genuinely incapacitated don't suffer too much in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process - which is why I favor private charity, with its ability to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fine-grained judgment calls about who is and is not really incapable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working.

<P>I'm quite suspect of private charity being able to make these fine grained
<BR>
judgement calls. I could accept that they might be able to only hand charity
<BR>
to those in need; I am less convinced that all of (or even a good proportion
<BR>
of) those in need will necessarily receive handouts.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly, from close observation of true slackers (not fun, I assure
<BR>
you), I would even doubt the ability of private charities to seperate the
<BR>
needy and the slackers. There are a good proportion of professional charity
<BR>
cases out there, and they get a damned lot of non-govt handouts, be assured!
<BR>
I wonder whether the truly needy could appear as needy as the professional
<BR>
slackers have learned to?
