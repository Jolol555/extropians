<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;The Chinese never really used gunpowder as more than a curiousity, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;they never invented anything that could properly be considered a gun in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;any conventional sense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No guns, but they did have cannon, which were a critical part of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ming military system against steppe nomads.  It's certainly true they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; did far less with it than the Europeans did.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The original Chinese cannons were of limited capability due to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limitations of their materials and fabrication methods.  While they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used effectively against soft targets, such as the steppe nomads, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were too weak to be effectively used against harder targets.  The bores
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were quite weak and generally not very reliable.  This was also the reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Chinese were not able to produce musket-type personal weapons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The europeans on the other hand, used their superior metal technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and rapidly produced very strong and functional designs (such as the every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; popular cast bronze bore) that were actually capable of the rock-shattering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capability usually associated with cannons.  The Europeans quickly drove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the technology to the point where it was well-suited to a much broader
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; set of military roles, such as breaching hardened fortresses.  The vastly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superior european cannons were introduced in China in the 16th and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 17th century by the Jesuits.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, it was the muslims, esp. Mohammed II who originated the cannons'
<BR>
ability to breach hardened fortresses. Screw-breach iron hoop &amp; stave forged
<BR>
cannon with 36 inch bores were constructed for his assault on Constantinople
<BR>
which ended the last remnant of the Eastern Roman Empire. These cannon were so
<BR>
well constructed they were still in use hundreds of years later when British
<BR>
ships tried to run the Dardanelles to the Black Sea, and were bombarded with
<BR>
three foot diameter stone cannonballs...
