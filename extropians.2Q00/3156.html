Well, Sasha did not isolate himself socially at all. Beyond his extropian
<BR>
friends, he had his coworkers and his dancing / techno friends in Cambridge.
<BR>
I've gone over his mail on several mail lists he belonged to on egroups, and the
<BR>
first indication of any kind that something was wrong was that monday when a
<BR>
dancing friend of his posted that he had said over the phone he was going to
<BR>
kill himself and hung up, and could not be reached after that. I also know that
<BR>
Sunday he went out for a drive in the country with a couple friends and was
<BR>
quite cranky, complaining that &quot;everything was in the city, why are we going to
<BR>
the country, etc.&quot; though he seemed to have relaxed once they got to where they
<BR>
were going in Newburyport.

<EM>&gt;  &gt; One lesson we might want to learn here is that we brainy

<EM>&gt;  &gt; discuss big ideas types might try to pay more attention

<EM>&gt;  &gt; to the emotional health of those among us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robin, it is hard to detect suicidal predisposition (if this is indeed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as to what has happened) over such a tenous link as email. Looking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back, I still fail to notice any signs of impending doom in Sasha's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; email exchanges, with the possible exception of phases of prolific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea generation, which in the retrospective might be indicative of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manic phase of a bipolar personality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The only lesson I can derive from this, is that those of us who live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in physical proximity should meet more often, and use this meetings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for more than just intellectual exchanges. Unfortunately, we are all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; busy people, which makes this hard to achieve.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Still, worth a try.
