<P>
<EM>&gt; It appears as if Emlyn (pentacle) wrote about link (yes I did)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,21171,00.html">http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,21171,00.html</A>&gt;:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |The link below is to an article by a senior Kylix team member; they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |moving Delphi &amp; C++ Builder (notable Windows development environment
</EM><BR>
tools)
<BR>
<EM>&gt; |to Linux, and providing me with the infrastructure to reach my evil
</EM><BR>
Gatesian
<BR>
<EM>&gt; |tentacles into KPJ's Linux-brain-of-purity-and-love.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;grin&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I really hope you keep the name &quot;Linux-brain-of-purity-and-love&quot;; it suits
<BR>
you. I mean that in a positive sense.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My reasons for preferring Linux over MS-Windows work for me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not necessarily for anybody else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My points for preferring Linux over MS-Windows:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   o I want full control over the programs in my cybernetic parts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If they don't do what I want, I can rewrite them to do what I want.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I find reprogramming much easier having the source code available. 6-]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>If I have to re-write my OS, I'm in trouble. Having detailed API specs does
<BR>
the job just fine for me. I can appreciate having the source, just for the
<BR>
love-of-source (I like minux for this too, and hacking schedulers and
<BR>
what-not is fun). However, I'm falling more on the user side as far as
<BR>
wearables go, and if I have to stuff with OS code to do it, I'm getting
<BR>
less-than-interested.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   o I have a limited amount of money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since I don't have to pay for the software, I can use that money to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upgrade my hardware instead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Some unscrupulous people (...) don't pay for MS. Bad, bad people.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   o Most of the MIT cyborgs use Linux, so I can re-use their software.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>There's a curly one for me. I did notice that at least one of them dual-boot
<BR>
with 98. Maybe I can be a luney fringedweller using MS. Does this mean that,
<BR>
by a peculiar twist of fate, I get to hold the moral high-ground?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As you might appreciate, my reasons for preferring Linux need not be
</EM><BR>
yours.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; And vice versa.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     /kpj
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely cool, I have total respect for your decisions. My responses above
<BR>
should be interpreted in kind.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the wearable-related links; I'm now subscribed to wear-hard
<BR>
(official lurker). It looks like my easiest incremental path to wearable
<BR>
computing land is to
<BR>
1 - Get a backpack for my notebook (and perhaps a few spare batteries)
<BR>
2 - Get a Twiddler chord keyboard (it's a mouse too?)
<BR>
3 - See what kind of display I can get my hands on. Have you seen those
<BR>
amazing glasses with the display dot on one lens?
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Thad.Starner/">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Thad.Starner/</A>
<BR>
They're only prototypes I think, but soon to hit production.
<BR>
4 - I just recently got a copy of IBM via voice (voice recognition software,
<BR>
someone I know got it with their Aptiva and doesn't use it). I had wondered
<BR>
if I could code using it. Fraid not; it would be a nightmare. But voice
<BR>
recognition would be a real boon for emails like this on a wearable,
<BR>
although you really want their non-crippled version (executive? enterprise?)
<BR>
which allows you to dictate into software other than MSWord and &quot;SpeakPad&quot;.
<BR>
Anyway, it wouldn't be a bad addition to an initial wearable setup.
<BR>
<P>The notebook will be a good first step. I already carry it everywhere
<BR>
(really everywhere), so putting it in a backpack would make life much
<BR>
easier! And, it's a damned site better specced than those little pcs for
<BR>
wearables! My goal is for my wearable to be my primary machine; ie: I don't
<BR>
go back to the desktop when I need a real machine. My notebook currently is
<BR>
my real machine, so that's no problem.
<BR>
<P>Do you have any experience of the Twiddler keyboard? Or other wearable-ready
<BR>
keyboard/mouse combos, like the wrist-keyboard?
<BR>
<P>As for GPS and antennas on my head, I'll leave that to stage two...
<BR>
<P>By the way, as I'm already dual-booting NT &amp; 95, I'm seriously considering
<BR>
adding Linux as well. It's time for me to jump in the deep end with Linux;
<BR>
it looks like it might actually matter to know something about it in the
<BR>
medium term future...
<BR>
