<BR>
mercantilism and capitalism, as the U.S. economy is a mixture of capitalism 
<BR>
and socialism and fascism. None of these terms seems to have a very precise 
<BR>
meaning.  In both of these countries there's an active &quot;underground&quot; economy.

<P>Bonnie,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having read most of Fredrick Von Hayek's book THE ROAD TO SERFDOM I 
<BR>
believe there is a fairly accurate definition of Fascism.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I recall Mussolini was a communist party worker in Italy at the time 
<BR>
the Italian veterans came home.  He wanted the communist party to represent 
<BR>
the views of these veterans as he felt there would be a political advantage 
<BR>
to doing so.  He was turned down by the communist party but felt very deeply 
<BR>
he was right.  He renamed himself a fascist and proceeded to gain political 
<BR>
power.  So far as I know Mussolini changed his label, changed some details of 
<BR>
his program but never changed his core beliefs from communism.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this mind I have to ask; in what way does the economy of the U. S. 
<BR>
follow the tenents of Fascism?
<BR>
