<P>As I understand it (from one TV program), they're doing just that -
<BR>
together, where they can't be so easily stamped on or picked off one by

one: they were striking for better conditions. I don't know the outcome.

<EM>&gt;Someone asked me the other day- why is it that the top 40 music is always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sooo lame, no matter what decade you are in? Obviously this is because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the majority of the people out there (think of a Bell curve here) _like_
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that music. 
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not that simple, as ad agencies know. Lots of people choose to buy
<BR>
Potter books because (1) they're simple and entertaining (as evidenced by
<BR>
the initial word-of-mouth break-out sales), (2) they're now massively
<BR>
hyped, (3) they're everywhere, crowding all the alternatives off the
<BR>
shelves - since those who own the shelf space insist on it, and insist on a
<BR>
series of other inappropriate accounting measures that are killing
<BR>
diversity of choice. This kind of Big Marketing leads to vast booms and
<BR>
busts, to enormous overstocks of books that *don't* take off and have to be
<BR>
pulped, to the ceaseless toppling and replacement of publishers and editors
<BR>
acting as if this were a rational process when actually it's a bizarre crap
<BR>
shoot. Now that Potter is flavour of the year, I hear that every other
<BR>
publisher is rushing out clones - a series by Clive Barker, etc etc. Anyone
<BR>
can see that this will tend to clog the market, but you keep following the
<BR>
sheep until they all fall to their deaths, then do it all over again when
<BR>
cowboy stories or nurse stories spontaneously emerge as slightly more
<BR>
interesting than kid wizard books. It's monocropping, with all the
<BR>
temporary benefits and finally fatal dangers of that stupid practice.
<BR>
Meantime, species are going extinct (and I'm one of them, whine whine).
