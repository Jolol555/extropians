<P>
<EM>&gt; As it happens, this particular topic has been rather well researched. Mike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is exaggerating a bit, but it is certainly true that in the first half of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 20th century American high schools taught many subjects that are now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered advanced college fare. My favorite example is the fact that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; material colleges now cover in three semesters of calculus used to be
</EM><BR>
taught
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in high school as a matter of course. Much the same thing has happened in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all of the sciences, not to mention literature and foreign languages.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, obviously that doesn't mean that every citizen of the day was
</EM><BR>
actually
<BR>
<EM>&gt; proficient in all of these skills. It does, however, make it clear just
</EM><BR>
how
<BR>
<EM>&gt; far our current system's standards have declined.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, maybe most people didn't actually understand all that calculus in high
<BR>
school. Perhaps its harder than once thought, and so has ended up in uni?
<BR>
(I'm assuming College is Uni; we do things differently down here).

(Isn't calculus that guy from Tintin comics?)
