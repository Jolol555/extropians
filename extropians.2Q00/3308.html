<EM>&gt; I could start talking about how apples and peaches had a common evolutionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ancestor one or two million years ago and apples and tomatoes had an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ancestor one or two hundred million years ago, it might start an interesting thread.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But on second thought I don't see the point, you'd just invoke the magic word you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always use when any argument is not going your way.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, let's go down that road since you seem to think it useful: in
<BR>
evolutionary terms, a tomato is related to berries.  The part we eat
<BR>
is also that part of all plants which biologists generally call the
<BR>
&quot;fruit&quot;: i.e., the part that carries the seeds, as opposed to things
<BR>
like roots, stems, leaves, and other parts.  In that context, given
<BR>
that definition of &quot;fruit&quot;, the word certainly applies to tomatoes.
<BR>
<P>There was a court case a while ago where tomato growers challenged
<BR>
the application of a tax on &quot;fruits&quot; to them.  The court ruled that
<BR>
the intent of congress was to tax those food items which in our
<BR>
culture are treated as luxury/dessert foods, while leaving staples
<BR>
unburdened.  In that context, the court ruled, tomatoes are a staple,
<BR>
eaten in much the same way vegetables are, and is therefore not a
<BR>
&quot;fruit&quot; for the purpose of the tax.  In other cultures, it might have
<BR>
been different: avocados, for example, are another fruit that is
<BR>
treated as a vegetable here, but it is treated like other fruits in
<BR>
South America where they are generally sweetend and made into
<BR>
desserts (avocado ice cream is great).
<BR>
<P>The point is that both of the predicates &quot;is-bio-fruit(tomato)&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;is-cultural-vegetable(tomato)&quot; are 100% true.  Unfortunately, our
<BR>
language has a tendency to use one word to represent many different
<BR>
predicates--called polysemy.  Rational argument must begin, then,
<BR>
by first teasing from each word what specific predicates are meant,
<BR>
and only after agreement on those can meaningful argument begin.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I&quot; is a _very_ polysemous word.  You think the argument isn't
<BR>
going Harvey's way because he (quite rationally) refuses to join
<BR>
it until you provide him with the precise predicate you intend for
<BR>
that word, and you continually refuse to do so.
