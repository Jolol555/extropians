<BR>
<P>You see, I don't charge myself so much for working for myself.
<BR>
It's because my part time boss, KPJ, is such a nice guy to me.
<BR>
Yeah, KPJ and I have this great job relation, you know.
<BR>
Like a kind of Zen-like relation, being One with each other, and all.
<BR>
<P>So.. it's pretty free to _me_.
<BR>
<P>And this twiddling ... tweaking ... you know ... has become an Nth nature
<BR>
to me ... where N is a rather large number...  probably because that's what
<BR>
I _do_ ... for a _living_ ... Yeah, that's the ticket!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- = # = -

<P>Anyways, installing a Red Hat Linux takes me approx. 20 minutes using FTP
<BR>
and a decent Internet connection.  It takes somewhat longer from a CD-ROM.
<BR>
<P>Oh yes.. the CD-ROM was inside a magazine I was buying anyway.
<BR>
Maybe I'll buy the glossy book with the documentation next time.  Maybe.
<BR>
<P>And MS-WINDOWS?  Last time I re-installed the wonderful IBM version of the
<BR>
MS-WINDOWS '95 (again! since it destroyed the contents of whole hard disk,
<BR>
again!), it asked for magic license numbers, killing off the whole hard
<BR>
disk (could there be an operating system installed on it on some partition?
<BR>
nah.. _nobody_ has that!), rebooting, and so on cavorting the whole evening.
<BR>
I went to sleep after a few hours...
<BR>
<P>And in the morning Big Blue had installed a fresh MS-WINDOWS for me to play
<BR>
Sid Meyer's Alpha Centauri on. 
<BR>
<P>So.. both MS-WINDOWS and LINUX have their merits, I guess.
