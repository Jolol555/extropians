Robert B. writes, quoting Hal:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Assume that the goo seeds are spread widely before beginning their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; growth phase.  Robert F. suggests dispersal by airplane.  Perhaps it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would work to spread rock-coated nanites in the form of dust released
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; into the atmosphere from a few locations over a period of many months.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; We now have potentially billions or even trillions of nucleation sites.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ok, so here you are talking about an intentionally designed terrorist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weapon using &quot;advanced&quot; nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<P>What part of this is &quot;advanced&quot;?  The ability to make trillions
<BR>
of particles?  The ability to cover them with rock?  The ability to
<BR>
disperse them by airplane?  Or is it the goo itself which requires
<BR>
&quot;advanced&quot; nanotech?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Each of these begins to grow simultaneously, not caring about local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thermal pollution, but limited by some constraining temperature, such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as the boiling point of water.  (We cook our food before eating it;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; perhaps the goo will find it more tender that way as well.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I dealt with this as well in my comments to Robert.  You simply *do not*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the resources around the globe (energy or matter) to have uniform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; growth rates.  Not enough biomass in deserts, arctic regions or under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ocean.  Probably not enough energy in arctic regions or the ocean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>It doesn't necessarily have to be uniform to produce destructive local
<BR>
and global heating.  Even if many goo seeds fall in unproductive regions,
<BR>
they can be preferentially seeded towards high biomass targets and you
<BR>
could still be dealing with hundreds of billions of seed sites.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; According to Robert F.'s figures, this will not cause a noticeable (4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; degree) global increase in temperatures until something like 0.0001%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of total biomass has been converted.  Due to the wide dispersal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; localized hot spots may not be detectable either.  At this point the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; global temperature will rapidly increase to 100 degrees C.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, only in regions where the energy and material resources are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficiently dense will they be able to grow at the most rapid rates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are huge regions of the planet where they will have a difficult
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time replicating at all.  So you get local hot spots that can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detected and eradicated from space or using ground based weapons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The standard precaution against this would be to have defense systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in places where biomass consuming nanobots cannot grow.
</EM><BR>
<P>You could still have many billions of seeds within the regions where
<BR>
growth is possible.  That's a lot of &quot;hot spots&quot;.  Zapping localized
<BR>
hot spots might make sense if you are talking about a few dozen or a
<BR>
few hundred, but a few million, billion, or trillion?  That's out of
<BR>
the question.
<BR>
<P>The big problem remains the exponential growth.  You go from power
<BR>
sufficient to raise the global temperature 4 degrees, to power levels
<BR>
sufficient to raise it 100 degrees C in just ten minutes, under Robert F's
<BR>
scenario.  Even if you have better detection equipment that can do better
<BR>
than the 4 degree point, still with exponential growth the goo will be
<BR>
at undetectable levels if you go back a few minutes or an hour previously.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes, if your goal is the destruction of life on the planet then this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be a good way to accomplish it except for the reasons I've cited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; above.  However, the probability that individuals who are that irrational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have the resources to develop the advanced nanotech and delivery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems required to produce the scenario you describe seems very low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to me.  Their resources would certainly be far less than the resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the groups developing the monitoring and defense systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, Robert F's paper necessarily and properly does not get into the
<BR>
motivations of the various groups involved.  It is meant to be a technical
<BR>
analysis of whether there exists a potential threat which cannot be
<BR>
reasonably countered.  It seems that the paper concluded that there was no
<BR>
such threat, but my reading of the details suggests exactly the opposite.
