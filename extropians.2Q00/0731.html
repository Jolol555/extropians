To my surprise, since I thought I had a rough and ready sense of these
<BR>
things, I find what looks like a fresh and challenging idea in evolutionary
<BR>
theory (a mere 18 years after it was proposed). This is adoptation, the
<BR>
outcome of molecular drive, explained by Gabriel Dover, prof of genetics at
<BR>
Leicester in the UK, in his new book DEAR MR DARWIN (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson,
<BR>
2000).
<BR>
<P>The frame of book is either engaging or cheesy, depending on how you feel
<BR>
about reading a correspondence between Gabby Dover (as he calls himself)
<BR>
and the ghost of Charles Darwin. Either way, Dover is a clear and sometimes
<BR>
lyrical writer, as befits a fellow working this seam of knowledge. The book
<BR>
seems to be adapted (or adopted, or exapted) from various articles and
<BR>
papers such as `Anti-Dawkins' (forthcoming). I'm still working through it,
<BR>
but he actually does seem to have a nifty gadget working for him. I've
<BR>
found a few sites dealing with the topic, such as

<BR>
<P>but you'll need to go ferret yourself, because I have this book to read...
<BR>
For those in the know, he starts with the mobile P gene moving from
<BR>
Drosophila willisoni =&gt; D. melanogaster at the start of the 20th century.
