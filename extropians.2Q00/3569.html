<P>But an evolutionary process not only writes stuff in opaque fashion,
<BR>
it does typically much better than the human programmer, too. A
<BR>
darwinian process solving a limited-scale problem produces FPGA
<BR>
circuits consisting from a mesh of coupled positive and negative
<BR>
autofeedback loops (duh, &quot;strangely&quot; our brain hardware works that
<BR>
way, too), which solve a task a much more compact fashion than a human
<BR>
designer (alas, so far this doesn't scale to high-complexity
<BR>
tasks). Since human designers typically take decades to make, in a
<BR>
very expensive process with a very slow yield, it is perhaps best
<BR>
limit the number of human experts as close to zero as it is possible.
<BR>
<P>It is not really necessary to have human or superhuman level process
<BR>
to generate code of a complexity higher than itself, in fact we
<BR>
wouldn't be there, would it be the case. We have no idea how to code
<BR>
an all-purpose metamethod, however, with the exception of evolutionary
<BR>
algorithms applied on the algorithm descriptions itself. This is the
<BR>
only metamethod which we certifiedly know works. We ourselves are
<BR>
instances of another metamethod (intelligence) produced by a
<BR>
metamethod (darwinian evolution), unfortunately, we don't come with a
<BR>
manual. Being so very poorely documented makes reverse-engineering in
<BR>
a fashion other than clean-room quite difficult (we haven't been
<BR>
designed with understandability by ourselves as part of the spec
<BR>
sheet), and also I surmise (YMMV) we'll probably run into an
<BR>
evolutionary algorithm as the algorithm operating very close to the
<BR>
hardware layer, so switching to darwin in machina right from the start
<BR>
appears prudent, if we want to address the issue in a focused fashion
<BR>
other than perpetuating the AI debacle.
<BR>
<P>We don't know how to write programs automatically in a robust fashion
<BR>
yet, however. So, the first problem would seem to mutate a population
<BR>
of mutation functions in a machine language (say, x86), screening the
<BR>
result for obvious nonviability (memory access out of bounds, time
<BR>
cycles exhausted, etc -- because no OS is bulletproof (though some
<BR>
seem to take some sweeps at it -- see crashme utility), so we have to
<BR>
do in a virtual machine like Bochs). We thus have a population of
<BR>
mutation functions, which are being invoked to operate upon other
<BR>
members of the population.  Clearly, there is a lot of knowledge
<BR>
necessary to modify machine code while not produce programs which
<BR>
bomb. We have no (or, at least, very little) idea of how to do this,
<BR>
so letting the machine solve this part of the task from scratch is
<BR>
prudent.
<BR>
<P>After we find our magic mutation function, it fitness landscape will
<BR>
react much more benign to mutations. (This is really, really, really
<BR>
important. Believe me.) This process has to be repeated, wherever we
<BR>
change our substrate, be it machine programs, massively parallel
<BR>
machine programs tightly coupled by asynchronous message passing,
<BR>
FPGAs, or cellular automata patterns. (In fact, in latter case one has
<BR>
also to coevolve the rule, which increments the self-referentiality by
<BR>
another notch).
<BR>
<P>As measured by the metric of a rodent (a mouse..rat), I don't see such
<BR>
intelligence in a machine other than evolvable hardware (EHW) boxes,
<BR>
which are run by evolutionary algorithms. Of course, you all are
<BR>
willing to try (I haven't read <A HREF="http://singinst.org/CaTAI.html">http://singinst.org/CaTAI.html</A> yet, but
<BR>
I will once my deadline is past), but I just don't see it sprout legs, 
<BR>
blowing you a raspberry, and running off, sorry.
