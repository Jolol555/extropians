<P>
Love &amp; peace, may I become a Buddah for the benefit of all.
<BR>
<P>Having kicked about in Extropian and transhuman circles for a while now, I
<BR>
am clearer in my mind why the transhuman 'gradualist' approach is not
<BR>
sufficient.
<BR>
<P>The so-called 'radical' transhumanism is no longer radically futurist - it
<BR>
is just a philosophical wing of big business and the political mainstream.
<BR>
<P>With the adoption of the internet on a wide scale and the NASDAQ explosion,
<BR>
the
<BR>
weight of mainstream commercial and media opinion has actually been
<BR>
&quot;transhuman&quot;, for some time, particularly in the wake of the 2000 millenium
<BR>
build-up.
<BR>
<P>Extropians are keen to have their heads crycogenically preserved ... but so
<BR>
what, didn't Disney have this idea in the 50's or 60's? The extropian
<BR>
debates about the pro's &amp; cons of the death penalty in the States and so on
<BR>
is hardly cutting-edge, not much you can't find in letters page of The
<BR>
Times.
<BR>
<P>If you are labelled, and predisposed, to a state of intellectual limbo ...
<BR>
then you are travelling but never arriving .... permanantly in a
<BR>
transitional state. And who is to judge when the 'change' has occurred
<BR>
anyway?
<BR>
<P>So the swifter and more positive, radical, option is to declare yourself
<BR>
post- or neohuman at the outset, act as though it were true, and wait for
<BR>
the changes to happen all by themselves!
<BR>
<P>www.X-human.com E-ZINE is clawing its way out of the creative abyss, hungry
<BR>
for articles and amusing drawings. Anything with a posthuman theme, please,
<BR>
'hot' and unusual features, photos, &amp;c.
<BR>
<P>www.Att.ac new website is aimed at academic reform, and in particular the
<BR>
demolition of the dismal and failed &quot;analytic&quot; human-era conventionalist
<BR>
school of western philosophy that has taken hold.
<BR>
<P>Have you read any philosophical journals lately ... long-winded,
<BR>
self-important, content-free cryptic garbage.
<BR>
These &quot;philosophers&quot; along with, perhaps, the behaviourism-derived
<BR>
&quot;clinical&quot; psychology establishment, are overdue a major shakeout. There are
<BR>
better, newer methods and systems of thought around, and these two big,
<BR>
suffocating &quot;intellectual cobwebs&quot; need to be blown away.
<BR>
<P>So mote it be.
