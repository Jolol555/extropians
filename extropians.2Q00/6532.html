<P><EM>&gt;Can we all agree, though, that in general, people are willing to work harder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if their material rewards are directly proportional to the work done? 
</EM><BR>
<P>You couldn't prove it by me. I could multiply my material rewards manyfold
<BR>
by writing franchise or sharecrop fiction, or better yet by churning out
<BR>
slick mega-bestsellers called QUANTUM ASTROLOGY. Would take less work and
<BR>
earn more money. 
<BR>
<P>Watched a TV program the other night on the efforts by cleaning and other
<BR>
maintenance staff in Silicon Valley to earn enough to cope with the
<BR>
explosion in rents and other prices in the area. The poor buggers seemed to
<BR>
be working as hard as humanly possible, two jobs cleaning, mother and kids
<BR>
sleeping in the one shockingly expensive room... I guess if you paid them
<BR>
more they'd work *really* hard.
<BR>
<P>My hope is that, as we approach the Spike, most of those odious jobs will
<BR>
disappear, and new ways will be found to assure the people displaced from
<BR>
work of a decent basic subsistence. That, luckily, is alleged to be one of
<BR>
the benefits of drextech assemblers - if they arrive on schedule.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So what IS it like in Australia, Damien?   
</EM><BR>
<P>Not that different from how it is in the States, actually, Bonnie. :)
<BR>
<P>Less chance of getting shot to death. The two or three percent of
<BR>
aboriginal people have a worse time than American Indians, I'd guess, due
<BR>
to massive culture shock that's still after 200 years making it difficult
<BR>
for the two cultures to co-exist (and this is not just attributable to
<BR>
racism or mean-spirited or insanely ethnospecific govt and charity policies
<BR>
etc, although those have played their part). Many fewer people
<BR>
proportionately who suffer from lack of medical treatment. Far less
<BR>
gradient between the rich and poor, although of course that differential is
<BR>
increasing and introducing a marked change in the previous sense of
<BR>
egalitarian fairness (`mateship', `a fair go'). But how do I know how this
<BR>
compares? I've lived here all my life... (and spent a bit of it watching
<BR>
and reading US media).
