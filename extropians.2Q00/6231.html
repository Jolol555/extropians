<P>
Being by nature nonconfrontational, I am extremely reluctant to
<BR>
wade into this goddam morass, but there is something I think
<BR>
desperately needs to be said.
<BR>
<P>Regardless of what viewpoint one is posting or what circumstances,
<BR>
do read carefully everything you write before you post, and think,
<BR>
think hard: is there aaaaanything, aaaaanywhere in this post, that could
<BR>
possibly be interpreted as a threat of any kind?  If so, please reword it.
<BR>
<P>Many of us here have never met each other, and we know that
<BR>
the internet is a medium which poorly transmits sarcasm and
<BR>
literary subtlety.  You know I goof a lot on the list, but not
<BR>
anything that could ever be interpreted or misinterpreted as
<BR>
a threat.  If I ever do, someone please point it out to me, and
<BR>
I will run a sigline saying &quot;None of the foolishness
<BR>
I post was ever intended as a threat of any kind.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Perhaps even the terms &quot;killfiling&quot; and &quot;posse&quot; should be avoided
<BR>
during a wicked flamewar.  &quot;Plonking&quot; is better.  Furthermore, that
<BR>
&quot;killjoy Bill Joy&quot; is in poor taste and should be avoided.  Bill
<BR>
Joy doesnt know us.  I would be appalled if he feared for his
<BR>
safety just because his name happens to lend itself to wordplay
<BR>
and his views disagree with ours.
<BR>
<P>Let us conduct ourselves as a bunch of sane gentlepeople who
<BR>
happen to disagree and be mad as hell at each other.  But thats all,
<BR>
nothing more.  spike

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  Mike, this is about the closest thing to an actual death-threat as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  have ever witnessed on this list.  Even if you don't really mean it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  you must have suspected that this would bother some people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;So how would this be any different from threating someone with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;'killfiling'??? I suppose you are going to say threatening that too is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;death threat...
