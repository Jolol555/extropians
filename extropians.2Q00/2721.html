<P>
I am in shock. Sasha and I had gotten to know each other pretty good
<BR>
over the last two years or so. We had a lot of relatively common
<BR>
experiences, he went to MIT, I went to WPI, he was a Soviet Army vet,
<BR>
I'm an Air Force vet. beyond mere email communications, we had attended
<BR>
the Bostropians gatherings in Harvard Square numerous times, and I had
<BR>
stayed at his place a few times on extended weekends, while he and a
<BR>
girlfreind came to visit me on Mascoma Lake once in the winter a year
<BR>
ago. I've even recently been interviewing with the guys at 100x ventures
<BR>
in hopes of actually working full time with Sasha.
<BR>
<P>I remember once when he introduced me to one of his girlfreinds,
<BR>
saying,&quot;This is my good freind Michael, he's a very dangerous man.&quot; I
<BR>
was touched.
<BR>
<P>I have not heard about the circumstances of his death, though, but I am
<BR>
hopeful that he was cryonically suspended in a reasonable amount of
<BR>
time, and that his brain was in good shape. It would be a shame for us
<BR>
to lose him for eternity. If he was suspended, and suspended well, I am
<BR>
hopeful that we will see him again, in the not too distant future. Say a
<BR>
welcome back party in 2020 in Harvard Square? May 9th, 2020, everyone is
<BR>
invited...
