</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The United States Senator from New York Daniel Patrick Moynihan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; famously observed some years back that he had learned from the Federal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; government's own statistics people upon comissioning a review that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; distance from a state capital to Canada had several times the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; statistical correlation with results on standardized tests in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; state than did the amount of money spent per pupil.  (Specifically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the closer to Canada, the better the scores.)  He joked that the thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to do was move the state capitals to the northern border of each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; state.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Clearly many other factors are at work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Thats probably about as close to a racist remark as a liberal feels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; comfortable with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I assume you're talking about Moynihan and not me, because I'm no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liberal.  In any event, in what way is that at all racist?  (Unless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you're assuming the problem is poor performance by white people.)  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; northeast and California are probably more ethnically diverse than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rest of the country at large, and with California's capital at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sacramento, almost as far north as Trenton, the capital of New Jersey,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; California and the northeast states would all be contributing to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance on standardized tests that would get correlated to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; closeness to Canada.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was referring to Moynihan. Actually his comment makes a direct
<BR>
implication that the sliding scale of test scores as you move south is
<BR>
directly related to the percent of the population that is black or
<BR>
hispanic, which, no, the Northeast does not have a higher percentage of
<BR>
black people or hispanics than southern states. While New York City does
<BR>
have the largest puerto rican community in the US, northern New York
<BR>
state dilutes the actual percent of state population that is hispanic
<BR>
down to a small percentage.
<BR>
<P>Beyond that, his statement is actually false in at least one respect.
<BR>
Montpelier VT is I think the clostest state capital to Canada (I'm not
<BR>
sure of the distance of Lansing from Ontario), at least closer than NH,
<BR>
and NH has always maintained slightly better test scores than Vermont.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I personally think the difference may well be attributable to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; northern states going more industrial earlier, and later becoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; richer, as well as the likelihood that kids stay in and study during
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the long, cold, darker winters.  North Dakota produces a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disproportionate number of high school math prodigies and I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it's some racial superiority of the North Dakotans :-).  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hypothesize, off the top of my head that maybe being way out in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; middle of nowhere, plus in a place where it's too cold to hang out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outside much of the year, helps some kids focus on their studies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Possibly, or maybe they are raised, in fact, to obey and respect their
<BR>
parents more than city kids who rarely spend time at home or obey their
<BR>
parents.
