<EM>&gt; Which speaks more to how the internet violates our privacy and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; security of our property rather than to a problem with the legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; principle. The internet is our tool, not the reverse, we should not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our rights be enslaved to its limitations. We should not accept a police
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state just so we can feel better about ordering books online with our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; credit cards.
</EM><BR>
<P>True. But I didn't say anything about accepting a police state. I said that
<BR>
the idea that only human observations can constitute evidence is rapidly
<BR>
becoming impractical, and will be completely unworkable in the very near
<BR>
future. If you don't like my solution to the problem, offer another one -
<BR>
but don't tell me we can just bury our heads in the sand and ignore it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the courts insist upon extremely high reliability levels for recorded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence that is not corroborated by human eyewitness testimony, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they obviously share my concerns.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, they do. But the concern is not of infinite magnitude. At some point
<BR>
you have to face the fact that it is perfectly possible to build a sensor
<BR>
that is a more reliable witness than a human being, and that there are
<BR>
situations in which  it simply is not possible to rely on human senses
<BR>
directly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Log files and other recorded data, especially on the internet, is highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abstracted from reality, easily misinterpreted and manipulated. For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example, with a few hours work, I could jimmy up a log file that shows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you used my web server to access kiddy porn sites overseas on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; numerous occasions, enough so that a particularly zealous cop could get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a search warrant and literally destroy your house, office, and computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system looking for evidence.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is why log files alone shouldn't be enough to convict someone unless
<BR>
they come from a system with very strong anti-tampering measures. OTOH,
<BR>
human beings can lie at will, and people get locked up based on nothing but
<BR>
someone's word all the time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you or anyone in your office or household is like the average male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; web browser, you've got a good number of porn images saved to your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system or sitting in your browser cache directory. While you may have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never actively searched out kiddy porn, it is highly likely that, if any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; user of your computer is typical of the average male web browser, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have files which could be argued fit the statutory definition of kiddy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; porn, that you never intentionally saved, or that you understood to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing but flat chested 18-20 year old women. Despite actual innocence,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you could be strung up in public as a sexual predator.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even if you don't browse such things, I could also anonymously email you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a zip file with such images in it. You could deleted the message, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the attachment would still sit in your cache, and even if you deleted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your cache, the data can still be recovered by law enforcement level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data recovery techniques.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A system that relies on unwitnessed, abstract, impersonal data is at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high risk of corruption, perversion, and manipulation. It is not data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that should be trusted in a court of law.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nothing should ever be assigned a 100% level of trust in a court of law. But
<BR>
that doesn't mean the level of trust has to be 0%. The idea is supposed to
<BR>
be to present the jury with all available data and let them decide who to
<BR>
believe, remember?
<BR>
<P>Besides, the original topic was what to do with systems that are far more
<BR>
difficult to tamper with. It is impossible to make any device completely
<BR>
tamper-proof, but it is pretty easy to make them robust enough that it takes
<BR>
real expertise to falsify their data. If the device also has reasonably high
<BR>
accuracy (say, &lt;0.01% false positives), it is going to be much more common
<BR>
for a human witness to lie than for the device to give false data.
<BR>
<P><P>I have to admit, BTW, that I find it both amusing and sad that we can be
<BR>
having this argument in this particular forum. Can you picture applying a
<BR>
'only direct observations by sentients can be evidence' rule to a society of
<BR>
Jupiter brains? Even relatively puny technologies like mature VR and
<BR>
animal-level AI make the idea unworkable. Either you eventually adopt a more
<BR>
flexible standard, or you end up with large swaths of social interaction
<BR>
that are ripe for criminal abuse, but completely beyond the reach of law
<BR>
enforcement.
