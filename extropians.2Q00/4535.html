<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, I think what Jesus had in mind when he said it, was running the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; camel through a blender, one peice of flesh at a time, pulverizing it's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bones, and running the solution through a micro-funnel so that it dripped 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; through the eye of the needle, over a period of weeks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Heh. Another sick mind. Of course, homogenized camel. Weeks? It all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;depends on the pressure. Diamond/sapphire orifice, voila. As a side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effect, you can use the liquid camel for material processing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Jesus is talking about entropy here: The hard part is putting it back
<BR>
together on the other side. The solution is obvious though: cash in
<BR>
your camel insurance to buy a trust fund, a jar, and a freezer to keep
<BR>
the goo in. Once nanotech is sufficiently advanced, have him
<BR>
reassembled. 
<BR>
<P>(It's terribly important to buy your policy now. You never know when a
<BR>
mad man will wander in from the desert and start squirting around your
<BR>
possessions at ultra high pressure. Buy a gun too. Jesus is just the
<BR>
tip of the hippy-pinko-borganist iceberg, and they have absolutely no
<BR>
respect for property rights.)
