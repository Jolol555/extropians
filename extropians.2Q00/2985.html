<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Now, lets assume that another bombing has occured. Mr. Powers happens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a) have a deisel tractor (and a fuel tank to keep it fuelled), b) be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;farmer, so he has a lot of fertilizer, c) be an electronics hobbyist,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and enjoy making remote control devices, d) be known to have made up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;explosives in the past and used them on his private property simply for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the purpose of clearing stumps (as is the case with thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;farmers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and other property owners all over the country), e) have in the past
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;written letters to the editor of his local paper decrying the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;activities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of an organization or government agency that happened to have had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;offices or facilities at the site of the bombing, f) have been stopped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;for a traffic violation on the day of the bombing within 20 miles of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;bombing location. Under the rules of evidence and the prosecutorial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;procedure used in the Oklahoma case, its is pretty much an open and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;shut
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;case that Mr. Powers is the bomber in this event. No eyewitnesses are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;needed to place him on the scene at the time of the bombing, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;eyewitnesses are needed to prove that he actually made the bomb.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;This IS how justice gets done today in America.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, lets assume all that.  Now, lets *also* assume I was fortunate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; live in a tranparent society.  I would submit the video record of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; during the few days leading up to the bombing and viola! instant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;iron-clad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; allibi!  I'm not only *not* convicted, I'm not even charged!  After a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes of interrogation, the whole ordeal for me is over for good.  &quot;Oh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; horrors of transparency&quot;, eh?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Thats not Transparent society, that is private serveillance. Not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;same. Besides that, it would not take the government much work to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;'prove' that your coverage was faked.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. There is nothing that requires a &quot;transparent society&quot; to consist of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government-only surveillance.  My preference would be for *everyone* to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conduct their own surveillance which could be verified, if necessary, by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone else's surveillance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2. You are *assuming* that when I said &quot;I would submit the video record of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my life&quot; that I meant my own private recordings.  That is not necessarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what I meant.  As you suggest, it would be even that much better for me if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the video record had been created and/or maintained by the Government.  That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would take away the one possible problem for me: the claim that I had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; altered the record.  If the government had its own copy (and assuming it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showed the same thing as my copy) then my life is even easier.
</EM><BR>
<P>Assuming.... you tend to make a lot of assumptions...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course if I was the actual bomber the last thing in the world I'd want is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a mutually verifiable accurate record of my doings.  Which goes back to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my main argument: that honest folk have much more to gain, and much less to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fear, from a transparent society.  You, by your own hypothetical, have made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this point for me as eloquently as I could ever hope to.  Thanks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>If you think that a transparent society, with the government we have,
<BR>
would actually benefit you, you are sadly mistaken. First thing that
<BR>
would happen would be that any exculpatory evidence would be seized by
<BR>
the police. THen it would either dissapear, or be substituted with
<BR>
finely counterfeited evidence that incriminates you.
