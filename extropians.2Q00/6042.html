</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Actually most active environmentalists are drifting toward an overt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-human position. Take the Sierra Club, for example...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...Then take for example the Makah, a small, poverty stricken indian tribe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the Nortwest coast that has always been shortchanged by the BIA,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; living on a small reserveation. ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;... If you think Kazinski was alone, you are sorely mistaken. When
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universities in California host seminars titled &quot;Kazinski was Right&quot;, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are now, then its a foregone conclusion that ecotage and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eco-terrorism are now accepted political activities.
</EM><BR>
<P>Michael, I don't know if your post was directed my way.  If so, you're
<BR>
preaching to a member of the choir.  But I can see how my prior message
<BR>
might have been misleading.  When I wrote:
<BR>
<P>&quot; The most vocal of the &quot;environmentalists&quot; are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; acting in ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that indicate they're concerned with destruction and obstruction per se
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rather than with any love of human-kind.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I should have replaced the words &quot;concerned with&quot; in the last sentence with
<BR>
the words &quot;motivated by.&quot; That would have better expressed what I was trying
<BR>
to say.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Low profiles are good as a first line of defense. I don't keep a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; security system on my jeep, it has what I call 'urban camouflage', i.e.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a couple sprayed over rust spots and some peeling paint. When I venture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the big city criminals look at my car and assume that there can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be anything valuable there...if and when I buy a new vehicle, I'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably spraypaint a patch or two on it just for grins...
</EM><BR>
<P>LOL!  Sounds a bit like MY jeep, only yours is probably in lots better
<BR>
condition. I could leave mine on a city street overnight with the keys in
<BR>
it, and I expect it would still be there the next morning. It's got quite an
<BR>
engine in it, though.  Just keeps running and running and running...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; THe difficulty with buying freedom is that by conducting the purchase,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you acknowledge that they aren't or weren't yours originally to begin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's all in the attitude, Michael.  Perhaps offering a bribe might be
<BR>
considered the easiest way of removing an obstacle rather than buying
<BR>
freedom?
<BR>
<P>Bonnie
