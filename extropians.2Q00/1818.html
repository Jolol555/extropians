<EM>&gt; While watching the news of the forced split of Microsoft last night, I was

<EM>&gt; he was confident that &quot;...justice would be served in the end.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately, I don't believe it.  What I can't understand is why such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driven, high profile and all-around successful people choose to work within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a system which frequently works against them.  MS has done far more for the

<EM>&gt; for them.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; As one who deeply respects Gates and Microsoft, I want MS to resume as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has for the last decade: innovative, growing and successful; working within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a system which has none of those facets makes it hard for me to see how it

<EM>&gt; can be done.

<P>I strongly advise you to read Judge Jackson's original Findings of Fact

in the Microsoft case, at:

<BR>
<P>Microsoft's practices have sought to establish and maintain a monopoly
<BR>
in the operating system field. They have then used the leverage this has
<BR>
given them to establish strongholds in other areas. In all of these,
<BR>
they have ignored standards compliance, acted uncompetetively to the
<BR>
point of illegality and in general been directly in the way of free and
<BR>
open control of technological development - something I know people on
<BR>
this list support.
