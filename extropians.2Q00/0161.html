<P><P>Localized Brain activation by selective tasks improves specific
<BR>
cognitive functions in humans
<BR>
Agnes S. Chan, Mei-Chun Cheung, Yim-Chi Ho, Wu Jing He
<BR>
Neuroscience Letters 283 (2000) 162-164
<BR>
<P>Warming up is a good idea when doing a physical act; by priming the
<BR>
muscles it becomes easier to make an effort. Does the same hold for
<BR>
the brain? Apparently it does, according to this paper. The authors
<BR>
tested giving test subjects a visual/memory task or a motor task, and
<BR>
then tested at a memory or motor task. It turned out that by warming
<BR>
up the performance was increased for the right kind of task.
<BR>
<P><P>Virtual reality as an adjunctive pain control during burn wound care
<BR>
in adolescent patients
<BR>
Hunter G. Hoffman, Jason N Doctor, David R Patterson, Gretchen
<BR>
J. Carrougher, Thomas A. Furness III
<BR>
Pain 85 (2000) 305-309
<BR>
<P>Pain can be mentally limited by associative (think about it but remove
<BR>
the negative valence) and dissociative pain management (think about
<BR>
something else). This paper describes two cases where virtual reality
<BR>
was used to help patients with painful wounds. It was found that being
<BR>
immersed in VR was much more effective at decreasing pain ratings than
<BR>
playing a computer game; immersion has a dissociative effect that
<BR>
seems to be quite strong. Not that many pain wards have a Silicon
<BR>
Graphics Octane MXE standing around - yet.
<BR>
<P><P>Focusing Vacuum Fluctuations
<BR>
L.H. Ford and N.F. Svaiter
<BR>
Quant-ph/0003129
<BR>
<P>The Casimir effect occurs when two conducting plates are placed close
<BR>
to each other in vacuum. The vacuum energy between them will become
<BR>
lower than outside, since the plates prevent long wavelength virtual
<BR>
particles from occurring, and this creates an attractive force. This
<BR>
paper looks at the effect of a parabolic mirror in vacuum. It turns
<BR>
out that a similar effect will act to attract an atom to the focus of
<BR>
the parabola. Nice to see that you can focus nothing.
<BR>
<P><P>Evolution and devolution of folkbiological knowledge
<BR>
Philip Wolff, Douglas L. Medin and Connie Pankratz
<BR>
Cognition 73 (1999) 177-204
<BR>
<P>As culture and society changes, the average person's knowledge base
<BR>
changes. This article tests the hypothesis that general knowledge or
<BR>
mental use of biological kinds has decreased since the industrial
<BR>
revolution. The authors do this by examining the quotations from the
<BR>
16th to the 20th century in the Oxford English Dictionary.  They find
<BR>
a quite strong decline in words referring various kinds of trees
<BR>
starting in the 19th century, a decline not found in non-biological
<BR>
categories (there has been a marked increase in book- and furniture
<BR>
related-terms lately, for example). I'm not entirely convinced this
<BR>
shows an erosion of knowledge, but it definitely shows we are not
<BR>
thinking as much about trees as we once did.
<BR>
<P><P>Exploring the natural foundations of religion
<BR>
Justin L. Barrett
<BR>
Trends in Cognitive Science
<BR>
<P>A review describing the cognitive approach to religion. It doesn't
<BR>
deal with the spectacular stuff like trances, meditation or visions,
<BR>
but rather with the questions about how religious concepts are
<BR>
acquired, maintained and used to motivate and direct actions. It seems
<BR>
that god-concepts are not that different from ordinary concepts and
<BR>
that normal cognition can lead to extraordinary thoughts. For example,
<BR>
religious concepts are usually minimally counterintuitive - concepts
<BR>
that are too counterintuitive (break category assumptions) are
<BR>
simplified to more intuitive concepts, while a certain level of
<BR>
counterntuition makes them more memorable. One hypothesis that may
<BR>
underlie many religious ideas is the hyperactive agent-detection
<BR>
device (HADD): we are predisposed to detect agency (which makes a lot
<BR>
of evolutionary sense), so we tend to detect intentional agency even
<BR>
when there is none and this makes us posit agents as explanations when
<BR>
something happens (lightening strikes - who did that?).
