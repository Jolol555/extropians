Friends,
<BR>
<P>Both Nadia and Robert have addressed this situation with grace, and I would
<BR>
like to ask that we honor Max's request. Sasha was a very close friend of
<BR>
mine and I am still grieving, as I am sure others are.
<BR>
<P>In deference to Sasha, please remember that this is not a private email
<BR>
list and speculations about his death may have some bearing, but his mind
<BR>
was a brilliant one, full of curiosity and desire to learn and to express
<BR>
his talents.  Sasha handled issues that arose with dignity and integrity. 
<BR>
<P>Please let us think of his integrity and help to give him peace where he
<BR>
may not have been able to find it himself.
<BR>
<P>&quot;If everyone were clothed with integrity, if every heart were just, frank,
<BR>
kindly, the other virtues would be well-nigh useless.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Natasha
