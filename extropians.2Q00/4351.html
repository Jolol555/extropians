<EM>&gt; &lt;&gt;  Telecommuting.  Talked about as a tonic to commuter gridlock for a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decade, we OUGHT to be seeing an effect right about now as more and more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people have sufficient bandwidth in their homes to work from there.  I know 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I have developed a pattern of working from home a few days a month and I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to be encountering more anecdotal evidence of this trend as time goes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on.  But people still like the sociability of an office environment (I know I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do).  I'd look for the development of generic &quot;Edge City Workspaces&quot; for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; semi-telecommuting, where people with disparate professions could share an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; office space and some of the overhead of equipment and facilities (like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high-end videoconferencing) near their suburban homes.
</EM><BR>
<P>The company I work for is in the Silicon Valley, and traffic has really
<BR>
become awful there.  I visited the office last week, and although it is
<BR>
only about a mile from the airport as the crow flies, 5 miles by road,
<BR>
it takes 20-30 minutes during rush hour.
<BR>
<P>Partially as a result, telecommuting is becoming very popular at
<BR>
the office.  Out of about 15 engineers in our division, only four or
<BR>
five come in regularly.  The rest are very willing to do without the
<BR>
socialization opportunities in order to enjoy the pleasures of working
<BR>
at home.  It also seems that the office is all too often a source of
<BR>
stress, rumors and pressure in the fast-changing business environment.
<BR>
More and more people are opting out of office politics by staying home
<BR>
where they can get some work done.
<BR>
<P>The real limits on telecommuting are management concerns about oversight
<BR>
and productivity rather than employees' desires to socialize, IMO.
<BR>
But as traffic and other problems become more severe, pressure from
<BR>
the workers to allow telecommuting will continue to increase.  I don't
<BR>
think it will actually alleviate the problems of congestion, but it
<BR>
might reduce how quickly it gets worse.
