<EM>&gt;       &gt;&gt;if you ignore natures advice you go broke, as well you should.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;Sure, thats a given. Then what happens?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then you either get smart or you rely on the kindness of strangers.
</EM><BR>
<P>i.e. you get economic instability and a downturn if enough people wind up going broke at the same
<BR>
time. Which is my argument. Stop being obtuse.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; You are a) assuming Mr. Fusion Inc would want to hire union workers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What's with you and union workers? I mean, you're being so 20'th century.
</EM><BR>
<P>union workers as in a) high salary for low skill work, b) lots of convoluted, expensive, and time
<BR>
wasting work rules, c) the union threatens strikes if you want to robotize your assembly
<BR>
processes. Unless the union reticence against automation is discarded, then American manufacturing
<BR>
will remain in the 20th century.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;      &gt;and b) need to hire anywhere near as many people to produce machines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;that produce the same power demands as the former energy industry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It doesn't matter. Energy that was virtually free and limitless would open up all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sorts of opportunities that just aren't practical now, and all those endeavors would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need personnel.
</EM><BR>
<P>Those opportunities will not arise overnight, and the turmoil of crashing markets will cause large
<BR>
amounts of capital to evaporate. Capital that you need to have available to take advantage of
<BR>
those new opportunities. No capital means lost opportunities.....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;From an economic viewpoint, defense spending is an excellent incubator for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;research and development.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Excellent&quot; is not quite the word I would use to categorize the results obtained from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   hundreds of billions spent by the military on research and development, &quot;terrible&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   or &quot;meager&quot; would be better. I can see 3 reasons for this:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) There is far more development than research, and the development is for things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      that have little or no use in civilian life; stealth technology for example.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, stealth technology *is* being used commercially, even down to the point where you can
<BR>
buy a bra for your car made of stealth material to help protect yourself against radar speed
<BR>
traps...and that is a direct technology transfer, not an indirect one (like how the need for
<BR>
collapsible wheelchairs for astronauts on their pickup ships caused NASA to develop the modern
<BR>
tube steel/aluminum collapsible wheelchair. Like electroluminescent lighting technology which is
<BR>
now used to backlight just about anything, was totally and wholly developed due to defense
<BR>
research money. The list goes on.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) The cost of something is of no interest to the military mind, hence you get a B1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      bomber that is quite literally worth more than its weight in gold. This mindset conflicts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      with that of consumers and stockholders who would rather not spend $900 for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      a Momentum Impulse Driver and will just get a $3.98 hammer at Home Depot instead.
</EM><BR>
<P>Lets see, I don't know the cost of a B-1 bomber (which is not a stealth bomber) but the B-2 bomber
<BR>
(which is a stealth bomber) costs around $800 million (which includes lots of things besides just
<BR>
the plane itself, including hangars, training, parts, ground equipment, etc). A B-2 bomber weighs
<BR>
over 400,000 lb. which equals 6.4 million ounces. An ounce of gold goes for around $250-300, which
<BR>
makes the weight of the B-2 in gold equal to about $1.6-1.95 billion, so no, the B-2 is decidedly
<BR>
NOT worth its weight in gold, and since the B-1 is a much less expensive plane, I think I can say
<BR>
with conviction that the B-1 (which again is not a stealth bomber) is not worth its weight in
<BR>
gold.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;          &gt;When grain shipments to europe got cut off, and  interest rates rose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And neither event had anything to do with technology or productivity, it has everything to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do with government and civil servants who were not as smart as they thought they were.
</EM><BR>
<P>What it did have to do with technology and productivity is that the change in market demand for
<BR>
grain in the negative to that extent was not foreseen by the farmers, or by the bankers who
<BR>
allowed them to mortgage their farms to buy all the latest and greatest farm equipment (which is
<BR>
what allowed them to overproduce).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;food was left rotting on  the docks and in the fields, prices collapsed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No argument, it's a matter of historical fact, but I don't see how that helps your case.
</EM><BR>
<P>John, I know you are smarter than this.
