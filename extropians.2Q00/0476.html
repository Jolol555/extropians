<EM>&gt; Teachers are hardly low paid. The median teacher salary for a job that only takes 3/4 of the year (and provides over a month of vacation during the school year), is above $30,000, for an annualized salary of $40,000.00. Not bad at all.

<EM>&gt; That depends alot on where you are teaching!  In parts of the south and elsewhere, teachers are paid very little.  In Alaska, teachers are the second or third best paid in the nation.  We used to be number one.

<EM>&gt; I would not accept a plain old teacher for such an important job. Anyone who teaches such a course must

<EM>&gt; A 'plain old teacher' is not good enough?  I have had some wonderful 'plain old teachers' in my life who could have done a wonderful job teaching the course.

<P>It does depend upon the individual. I have also had some great teachers,
<BR>
and I would not categorize them as 'plain old teachers'. One was a WWII
<BR>
veteran of the Battle of the Bulge (who must have kept me in detention
<BR>
for at least half of the school days in 5th grade), and I would trust
<BR>
him with such a course. However, the majority of the NEA troopers I've
<BR>
known are either apathetic to citizenship or outrightly socialist.
