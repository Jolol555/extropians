<EM>&gt;Subject: You may not believe in God but She still believes in you, most of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Date: Mon, 19 Jun 2000 01:08:55 EDT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think it's about time to throw in my $US 0.02 First let me introduce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;myself, mercifully briefly. For a while now I have been lurking on the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and found the conversation for the most part quite interesting reading. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;religion was brought up however I felt I had to respond, it being a theme
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rather near and dear to my heart. Officially I am a Reverend within the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Church of Discord and, to my knowlege, am recognized as such by the State.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(my official title is Chaplain of the Legion of Dynamic Discord and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Episkopos
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the Order of the Sleepless (k)Nights). It appears many people on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lists would describe themselves as atheists and are quite proud of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. More on this later.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attempt to offer some balance I will argue for pseudo religion. Personally 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do not think all religions are invalid, but neither is one the True 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;religion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Divinity can be approached in almost any fashion to my mind, some methods
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work quite well for me that are nigh useless to others and vice versa.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Religion is nothing more or less than a framework to approach Divinty with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem arises with assumption of the One True Religion which I would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;does not exist. Atheism, on the other hand, has the equally silly claim 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;since none of them is the One True Religion, then none of them are &gt;True.
</EM><BR>
<P>Atheism in a strict sense has nothing to do with religion. It just means 
<BR>
that a person does not believe in a god.
<BR>
<P>But, actually, atheism is more about atheists being the kind of people who 
<BR>
stand outside society, laughing at assorted silliness, such as the fact that 
<BR>
the belief in a god is an obvious sham.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;All
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of them are True in the sense that they can allow one to relate to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Divinity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I would also like to ask all of you to take a charitable approach to &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clergy for they do, for the most part, mean well. When I followed the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Christian faith I was quite devout and would witness to all who would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;listen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because I genuinely feared for their immortal soul. Now that I am no longer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those who do the same to me seem incredibly irritating and small minded. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;having been on both sides of the fence I ask you to please be patient and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;somewhat forgiving for &quot;they know not what they do&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good intentions mean nothing when stacked up against the cold realities of 
<BR>
the universe. You see, THAT is the difference between atheists and 
<BR>
believers: atheists cannot fool themselves. Believers can. And THAT, my 
<BR>
well-intentioned friend, is the scary part!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&quot;There is absolutely no scientific evidence to prove life after death. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then there is no evidence to disprove life after death. Sooner of later you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will KNOW, so why worry about it?&quot; - Lazarus Long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>But to assert something, you must have *some* evidence! Especially something 
<BR>
as radical as life after death. Instead, all the evidence runs the other 
<BR>
way. There is also tons of historical evidence that all religions are simply 
<BR>
embodiments of man's (quite understandable) fear of death.
