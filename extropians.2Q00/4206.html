<EM>&gt; Anyway, what you are describing is not the kind of paradox people keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going on about. It seems like whenever talk of FTL communications comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up, people start spouting off about the future, the past, paradoxes, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just seems silly to me.

<P>According to relativity theory, if you can communicate faster than light
<BR>
in an arbitrary inertial reference frame, you can communicate backwards
<BR>
in time.
<BR>
<P>The reason is because of the relativity of simultaneity.  Two events
<BR>
which happen at the same time in one reference frame will happen at
<BR>
different times in another frame at motion with respect to the first.
<BR>
<P>Someone in a spaceship zooming past the earth could use his FTL
<BR>
communicator to send a message from the earth to the moon which
<BR>
arrived 1.2 seconds before it was sent, by the earth's reference frame.
<BR>
By his frame, the moon's reception of the signal is after the earth's
<BR>
transmission, with the signal transferred FTL.  But by the earth's frame,
<BR>
the reception is at an earlier time than the transmission.
<BR>
<P>An Earth-Moon based FTL system could then get it back to the Earth in
<BR>
less than 1.2 seconds, making it arrive before it was sent.
