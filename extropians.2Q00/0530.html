<EM>&gt; No, but once you have real &quot;almost anything&quot; boxes, you do get to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;infinite supply&quot; position for most human needs relatively quickly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is only a matter of days to give everyone alive an AA box.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is obvious if you think about the doubling times.  The mass doubling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; times for AA boxes are of the order of hours.  The mass doubling times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for humans are of the order of months to years.   Its only when humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be copied with the ease of computer files that the balance of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equation shifts back to the side where consumption may exceed production.

<P>Drexler's &quot;Anything Box&quot;, as I recall, requires a 100 kW cooling system
<BR>
(no energy inputs required, he says, because converting [almost
<BR>
anything] into diamondoid is an exoergic process), and a feedstock of
<BR>
acetylene.  A genuine &quot;infinite supply&quot; would require an Anything Box
<BR>
capable of eating dirt, powering itself via transformations or solar
<BR>
energy, and cooling itself in the local river or using air.  It's the
<BR>
&quot;eating dirt&quot; part that's worrisome, of course.
<BR>
<P>It seems like the default projection to assume that there will first be
<BR>
large, bulky, non-reproducing systems, perhaps even requiring human
<BR>
control for some stages.  Getting from there to a self-reproducing box
<BR>
will take considerable time, and then it will take a bit more time
<BR>
before the external environment required is reduced to dirt, water, and sunlight.
<BR>
<P>During the first stage diamondoid objects will be very dear, thousands
<BR>
or millions of dollars per kilo, limited mostly to nanocomputers and
<BR>
military apps.  During the second stage, diamondoid will begin becoming
<BR>
usable for consumer products, with a one-kilo nano-object costing from
<BR>
ten to a thousand dollars, and software starting to be the primary cost.
<BR>
&nbsp;During the third stage we would all be extremely rich, but this is
<BR>
irrelevant; during the second stage, either (1) Saddam Hussein will have
<BR>
reduced the earth to grey goo or (2) I'll have run a Sysop on my cheapo
<BR>
nanocomputer and we'll all be infinitely rich, or dead.
<BR>
<P>The other interesting question is how fast we'll run through those stages.
