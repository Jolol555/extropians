<EM>&gt; I once here cited analysis by Robert Shiller that suggested

<EM>&gt; the current stock market was in a bubble.  However, I just came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; across relevant analysis by J. Bradford Delong, who I have other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasons for respecting.  He finds that long term fluctuations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are probably rational, while short term ones can be irrational.

<P>I found a web page for Brad DeLong, at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Brad_De_Long%27s_Website.html">http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Brad_De_Long%27s_Website.html</A>.  He's got
<BR>
some fascinating essays there.  He writes a new article every week and
<BR>
you can subscribe to them.  Sounds like he'd be a great guy to have as
<BR>
your econ prof.

<P>I couldn't access this, but I found a 1990 essay on his web site at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/pdf_files/Bull_and_Bear.pdf">http://econ161.berkeley.edu/pdf_files/Bull_and_Bear.pdf</A>.  This one made
<BR>
much the same point, that stock prices are rational over the longer term
<BR>
(10 years), assuming that investors extrapolate recent dividend rates
<BR>
into the future and determine prices based on expected dividend flows.
<BR>
<P>He shows a graph (his figure 4) of actual stock prices over the last
<BR>
century, compared to what his model predicts, and they are in very close
<BR>
agreement visually.
<BR>
<P>However upon closer study, I noticed some things which made me more
<BR>
skeptical.  His model often lags the actual stock price movements.
<BR>
This is especially noticeable in the 1929 crash.  The actual market peaked
<BR>
in 1929.  But his predicted prices continue to climb and peak in 1931.
<BR>
<P>It is easy to see why, given his model.  He predicts stock prices based
<BR>
on recent years' dividends.  In 1929, dividends were still showing a
<BR>
pattern of growth in recent years.  It wasn't until the early 30s that
<BR>
declines in dividends causes his predicted prices to fall.
<BR>
<P>But actually you can argue that the drop in dividends in 1930 and
<BR>
onward was caused in part by the stock market crash.  Obviously all
<BR>
these effects are interrelated and it is hard to single one out, but
<BR>
the crash surely played a contributory role in the economic slowdown.
<BR>
As prices fell, people were wiped out, loans went bad, and there were
<BR>
widespread spending reductions.
<BR>
<P>It seems, therefore, that the stock market crash led to dividend
<BR>
reductions, which then caused his model to predict a stock market crash.
<BR>
But that's not a good prediction because the causative condition only
<BR>
occured after the supposed effect.
<BR>
<P>Does his more recent paper extend this analysis?
<BR>
<P>Also, whenever I read these kinds of papers I want to see whether the
<BR>
analysis works when extrapolated forward.  DeLong had results up through
<BR>
the late 1980s.  The last decade has been remarkable in its stock market
<BR>
performance.  Would his model successfully predict price movements in
<BR>
the 1990s?  My guess is that it would predict a strong bull market, as
<BR>
the continued economic expansion has presumably produced dividend growth.
<BR>
However I doubt that it would predict the degree of increase the market
<BR>
has actually seen, with P/E ratios much higher than historical averages.
