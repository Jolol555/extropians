<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;From the descriptions of the Brits on the list, sounds like the UK might

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Depends. Property crime rates 5 times higher than the US? No right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privacy on email? Political dissidents (irish) getting assassinated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government SAS units? No free press (Official Secrets Act and various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libel laws)? What are the tax rates now over there? What are the value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; added tax rates? Any country that taxes you on the number of closets you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have and the number of televisions you have is NOT a free country.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm inclined to agree with Mike Lorrey that the UK doesn't qualify on
<BR>
the &quot;no repression&quot; metric, but for entirely different reasons. 
<BR>
<P>Property crime rates are higher, but the murder rate is much
<BR>
lower. There's no right to privacy on email ... but that fight's still
<BR>
being fought in the USA, which has no explicit privacy provision in its
<BR>
constitution. The SAS aren't shooting IRA members any more, and I hesitate
<BR>
to call _anyone_ to carries an M-16 a &quot;dissident&quot;. The Official Secrets
<BR>
Act is in the process of being replaced by a Freedom of Information Act,
<BR>
and the Libel laws aren't censorship by government -- if you want to
<BR>
censor someone by accusing them of libel, it's a private lawsuit and
<BR>
it will cost you $$$. As for the tax rates -- income tax is _lower_
<BR>
than in the USA, although VAT is higher -- they include no-exclusions
<BR>
healthcare and a level of social security not found in the USA.
<BR>
<P>Basically, Michael is wrong on _every_ count he cites. But he's right in
<BR>
his overall assertion that the UK (or at least England/Wales, a distinct
<BR>
legal entity from Scotland or Northern Ireland) is not free.
<BR>
<P>The whys and wherefores of this are sufficient to fill a book, but
<BR>
basically boil down to &quot;first-past-the-post electoral systems with
<BR>
no constitutional safeguards suck&quot;. (Or rather, they only provide
<BR>
representative government when there's a relatively homogeneous
<BR>
population. And the UK has been becoming increasingly, radically,
<BR>
diverse since the end of the 1950's.)
