<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you imagine the vengence which would be unleashed on some penny-ante
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  tyrant if he unleashed a biotech attack on the US or its close allies?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  KA-friggin-BOOM brother!

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;You have more faith in our politicians than i do...and the liberal left.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;After all...those same folks are currently trying to sell a kid back into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;slavery...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are you talking about the child who was *kidnapped* by his mother and who is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being returned to his only remaining parent, as is *required* by law?  How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would *you* handle the situation?  By refusing the father custody of his own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; child?
</EM><BR>
<P>Since the mother was the primary custodial parent, kidnapping is hardly
<BR>
the term to use.
<BR>
<P>I do recognise the rights of the father, yet I alse recognise the
<BR>
sacrifice of the mother to gain what she wanted for her child, and the
<BR>
child's own suffering in the quest to come here. It is bad enough that
<BR>
so many American custodial parents are helpless when their foreign
<BR>
ex-spouses take their American children out of the country and the
<BR>
American's custody orders are not respected in courts of other nations.
<BR>
If we fail to support the rights of the father in the Elian, case, then
<BR>
the hopes of thousands of Americans are likely never to be fullfilled
<BR>
for their own children.
<BR>
<P>I would cut the gordian knot by first granting citizenship to Elian and
<BR>
posthumously to his mother in honor of her sacrifice and Elian's
<BR>
suffering. I would then rule that primary custody still belongs with the
<BR>
father, and that Elian should return to Cuba with the father, under the
<BR>
provision that the Cuban government accept that Elian is free to return
<BR>
to the US when he reaches the age of majority if he so wishes.
