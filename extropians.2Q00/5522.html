<EM>&gt; &gt; Are you aware of how some people around here feel about your beloved Mother Theresa?? lol!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; take care,

<EM>&gt; &gt; John Grigg
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Quite :)  And as much as I disagree with him on many other things,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fabulich's comments on the matter were pretty much on the nose :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Frankly I was shocked by the level of anti-catholic bigotry posted to the list.
<BR>
I had thought such sentiments only existed in the venue of KKK, Chistian
<BR>
Identity, and other radical protestant groups. While no longer a practicing
<BR>
Catholic, my extropic ideas about the universe and our place in it originated
<BR>
long before I heard of ExI, with ideas like Tielhard des Chardins' theories of
<BR>
the emmanetization of the eschaton (the original Omega Point theory). Tielhard
<BR>
was a catholic priest, BTW, and much extropic thought fits well with much
<BR>
catholic philosophy.
<BR>
<P>As for the condemnation of Mother Theresa for her 'deathist' organization, I am
<BR>
also shocked. While we extropes do hold attaining practical immortality to be a
<BR>
goal, we also have equal esteem for self ownership and self determination. Every
<BR>
right is only a right if its opposite is also a right: i.e. your right to free
<BR>
speech is only real if you also have the right to not speak if you so choose.
<BR>
Your right to keep and bear arms is only real if you have the right to not keep
<BR>
and bear arms if it conflicts with your personal ethics. Consistently, your
<BR>
right to life only exists if you also have the right to choose to not live. You
<BR>
are the architect of your life, and only you have the right to determine when it
<BR>
is to end. When it does end, you deserve to be treated in a humane and loving
<BR>
manner by others, not as a cast-off, not as a leper, or a piece of human
<BR>
garbage. It is to this end that Mother Theresa dedicated her life, and built up
<BR>
her order: to give each person's death the dignity it deserves. At the present
<BR>
time we cannot give every person immortality or the means to absolutely
<BR>
determine when their life is to end, so the least we can do is give every person
<BR>
their dignity when they die.
<BR>
<P>To insist that everyone who does not dedicate their life to acheiving
<BR>
immortality to be a 'deathist' is narrow minded. I am not personally working on
<BR>
immortality technology, only because that is not the area of my specific
<BR>
interest. I'm more attracted to exploring the universe, and I trust and leave it
<BR>
to others to deal with whatever areas other extropes strikes their own fancy. I
<BR>
won't condemn anyone who does not work on space projects to be 'anti-space
<BR>
exploration'.
