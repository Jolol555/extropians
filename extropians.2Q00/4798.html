</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; privately-funded expeditions sought to locate and navigate a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Northwest Passage, discover the North Pole, and make other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; significant discoveries in arctic regions. Most arctic discoveries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; were made by private expeditions. Most tragedies were publicly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; funded. By other measures as well [ship losses, crew deaths, scurvy],
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; publicly-funded expeditions performed poorly.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's surprising that private expeditions were so much better even when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dealing with what was largely an altruistic and non-commercial activity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Finding the North Pole and much other arctic research does not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commercial value.  Maybe finding a Northwest Passage would, but even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then the information would probably not have been kept proprietary.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would think that a non-commercial, altruistic expedition mounted by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; private sector would have many of the same problems as one financed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the government.  Since they don't have a commercial stake in the outcome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but are just backing the project for PR or perhaps pure science reasons,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they wouldn't necessarily be any more careful than the government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe I am wrong and the private expeditions in question did have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more of a commercial element?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so. I beleive that the reason is that the explorers had to raise
<BR>
funds for their expeditions, and only those whos reputations were considered
<BR>
most competent got funded, while publicly funded expeditions leaders most likely
<BR>
were staffed more by individuals who obtained their positions through political
<BR>
connections. A partisan leader of a government might decide that he needed some
<BR>
good PR and put together funding for an expedition, but when it came to choosing
<BR>
leaders, his partisan thinking would automatically eliminate anyone he thought
<BR>
were not of his political party.
