<P>
PBS is running a British series called The 1900 House.  The producers
<BR>
took a London house and restored it as nearly as possible to the state
<BR>
it would have had in the year 1900.  They took out the electricity and
<BR>
modern appliances, put in a coal burning stove and cast iron tub, moved
<BR>
the toilet to an outhouse, and so on.
<BR>
<P>A British family of 7 was selected from hundreds of volunteers to live in
<BR>
the house for three months.  They're supposed to dress like Victorians,
<BR>
eat and sleep and live as they did.  (Of course there has to be some
<BR>
cheating - no one expects the residents to go without modern medicine,
<BR>
and some safety modifications were made so that the house wasn't the
<BR>
deathtrap that so many were in an era when life was relatively cheap.)
<BR>
<P>The first episode was mostly about finding and fixing up the house, but
<BR>
future episodes will apparently emphasize the many difficulties the family
<BR>
faces in trying to live without modern &quot;conveniences&quot; (really essentials
<BR>
for most people).  It looks like the family will more or less go crazy
<BR>
from the drudgery of spending hours each day cooking and cleaning.
<BR>
Just doing the laundry practically takes all day.  It's a terrible way
<BR>
to live, in many ways worse than a prison labor camp.
<BR>
<P>This fit in well with one of the essays on the web site of
<BR>
Brad De Long, the economist Robin mentioned the other day.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Comments/FRBSF_June11.html">http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Comments/FRBSF_June11.html</A> discusses how
<BR>
much the U.S. economy has grown over the past 100 years.  One approach is
<BR>
to measure how many hours the average person had to work to earn enough
<BR>
to get a new bicycle, dinner set, piano, and so on.  If you do this we
<BR>
appear to be about six times richer than people 100 years ago on average.
<BR>
I gather that this is more or less the conventional economic wisdom.
<BR>
<P>However DeLong points out that this methodology restricts you to only
<BR>
buying things that were available 100 years ago.  Obviously most people
<BR>
prefer to spend their money on more modern goods, which means that we
<BR>
are really much richer still.  DeLong comes up with a rough estimate that
<BR>
we are actually 30 times richer than a century ago.  This difference is
<BR>
so large, he points out, that it makes the comparison almost meaningless.
<BR>
<P>It looks like the residents of the 1900 house will be ready to agree
<BR>
with DeLong by the time their three month sentence is over.
<BR>
<P>The interesting question is, what will people think who watch The 2000
<BR>
House, 100 years from now?  How much richer will they be, how much would
<BR>
they have to sacrifice to go back to living as people in our day did?
<BR>
<P>Of course we have to assume there is no Singularity (or one which leaves
<BR>
people behind), and we manage to avoid both blowing ourselves up and
<BR>
melting ourselves down.  But if there are recognizable humans 100 years
<BR>
from now, chances are they would have to give up far more to live in the
<BR>
2000 house.
