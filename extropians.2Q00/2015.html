<P>LEF Email List1 - <A HREF="http://www.lef.org">http://www.lef.org</A>
<BR>
<P>For Immediate Release:
<BR>
Contact: Mike Freedman, Life Extension Foundation
<BR>
(954) 561-7933 Ext. 10 or <A HREF="mailto:mike@lef.org?Subject=Fw:%20Cloning%20Breakthrough%20Detailed%20On%20Life%20Extension%20Web%20Site&In-Reply-To=&lt;004101bfb3db$f0e1c1c0$c485ecd1@neptune&gt;">mike@lef.org</A>
<BR>
<P>(Ft. Lauderdale, FL)  The Life Extension Foundation has just posted an
<BR>
exclusive interview on its comprehensive web site for health-related
<BR>
information (  <A HREF="http://www.lef.org">http://www.lef.org</A>  ).  The interview, with Dr. Michael
<BR>
West, the President and CEO of Advanced Cell Technology (ACT), focuses on
<BR>
a major breakthrough in cloning research that could sweep away today's
<BR>
problems of organ rejection, limited organ and tissue supply, and gene
<BR>
therapy, paving the way for cures to such diseases as Parkinson's disease,
<BR>
diabetes, sickle cell anemia, muscular dystrophy, organ failure, and
<BR>
perhaps aging itself.
<BR>
<P>The breakthrough involves the ability to grow biologically super-young
<BR>
cells of any kind desired from skin cells that are so old as to be on the
<BR>
brink of death.  This is projected to allow even very old individuals to
<BR>
donate a skin cell or a cell scraped from the inside of the cheek, and to
<BR>
have a single such aged cell give rise to super-youthful replacement
<BR>
cells, tissues, and organs.  Certain of these cells could be injected into
<BR>
the older donor, and would distribute themselves throughout the body,
<BR>
seeking out physiological weakness and correcting it by replacing dead or
<BR>
defective cells with new, youthful ones that are immune from rejection.
<BR>
<P>The work, being published in tomorrow's issue of Science, is the latest
<BR>
and perhaps the most sweeping breakthrough in cloning and embryonic stem
<BR>
cell research, a field so promising that it was endorsed by 67 Nobel
<BR>
Laureates and several other prominent scientists in a letter published in
<BR>
Science last year, urging Congress not to block developments in this field
<BR>
over misconceptions involving xeroxing humans for spare parts, the science
<BR>
fiction version of how cloning would be used.
<BR>
<P>As Dr. West explains in his interview on the Life Extension Foundation web
<BR>
site today at 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.lef.org/featured-articles/apr2000_clon_01.html">http://www.lef.org/featured-articles/apr2000_clon_01.html</A> , he doesn't
<BR>
envision growing new human beings to scavenge for body parts.  Instead,
<BR>
the process involves growing embryonic cells only to a point at which they
<BR>
acquire total power to become any other kind of cell or tissue, and never
<BR>
allowing them to move on to form any individuality.  Essentially a
<BR>
cellular dot smaller than the period at the end of this sentence would be
<BR>
used to grow mature tissue replacements directly in a laboratory.
<BR>
<P>The new research published in Science, according to Dr. West, rewinds the
<BR>
cellular aging clock &quot;in the same way that a key can be used to wind an
<BR>
old antique clock.&quot;  The new work therefore corrects the major defect of
<BR>
the cloning method used to create Dolly the cloned sheep, the first mammal
<BR>
cloned from adult cells. Unfortunately for Dolly, in inheriting the genes
<BR>
from her predecessor, she also inherited the biological age of her
<BR>
predecessor. The six new cloned cows made in ACT's labs, however, are
<BR>
actually biologically younger than ordinary cows of the same age, even
<BR>
though they were created from cells that were at death's door.
<BR>
<P>The Life Extension Foundation's interview with Dr. West is the most
<BR>
thorough examination of this breakthrough and its implications for
<BR>
medicine now available. The Foundation's web site - <A HREF="http://www.lef.org">http://www.lef.org</A> -
<BR>
is the world's best and most extensive source of comprehensive information
<BR>
about how to stay healthy and young as long as possible.  Its new 945-page
<BR>
book, &quot;Disease Prevention and Treatment Protocols, features advanced
<BR>
therapies to prevent and treat age-related diseases. Information on the
<BR>
book is available at <A HREF="http://www.lef.org/books-media/dispreprot.html">http://www.lef.org/books-media/dispreprot.html</A> The
<BR>
protocols in this book are available free of charge on the Foundation's
<BR>
web site at <A HREF="http://www.lef.org/protocols/">http://www.lef.org/protocols/</A>
<BR>
