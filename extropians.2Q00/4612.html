<EM>&gt; &gt;  Thanks Nadia, I do my best to be me. However Brian was referring to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Bonnie's post. (Just trying to get the references right before we all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  become hopelessly confused...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hm.... then. I RESPECT BONNIE for being herself!!!! (and all others who think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for themselves).
</EM><BR>
<P>Never said I didn't.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And that makes a lot more sense too, since she has the most AMAZING gardening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; skills. What I was objecting to is the tendency for list subscribers to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insist on WHAT is or isn't Extropian.  I think many things ARE if they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done with great skill.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, but that is not what I am driving at. Just because someone may
<BR>
perform some kind of activity that could be called extropic, does not
<BR>
mean that the person is really anything like an extropian. Is Martha
<BR>
Stewart an extropian? Should we all be spending our time gardening in
<BR>
adobe huts? I am talking about your total lifestyle and internal philosophy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  It happens too often for my taste, people reminding others to &quot;be more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extropian&quot;. ugh.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ummm well why is that a bad thing? I seek to increase extropy, both in
<BR>
myself and in general. Is providing critical analysis of other people's
<BR>
choices a bad thing? Or is this list a place where no one wants to face
<BR>
reality and hear anything possibly critical about themselves?
<BR>
<P>You would think any real extropian would love to hear ways to increase
<BR>
their &quot;personal extropy&quot;. Why aren't we having discussions on the list
<BR>
about how to be more extropian? We have sublists such as the investing-
<BR>
node where people can discuss strategies, but in general the people
<BR>
on this list seem remarkably unwilling to publicly discuss or ask for
<BR>
advice on ways they might improve themselves.
