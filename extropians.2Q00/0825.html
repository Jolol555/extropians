<EM>&gt; [regarding &quot;smart gun&quot; technology:]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't discount the possibility, and if such is possible (it likely is) I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  adamantly say that it should not be mandated until the technology can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  integrated into any gun of any price teir.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are two different questions here.  The first is the general question of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether an extropian should support pursuit of &quot;smart gun&quot; technology and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other is whether it should be mandated by law at some stage of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology's development.  Regarding your point on the first question, Mike,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think there would be good reasons to implement the technology, once it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficiently robust and flexible, in new weapons, even if it can't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practically retrofitted into older guns. 
</EM><BR>
<P>And I agree. I don't however, think that people should be banned from 
<BR>
owning or using older guns, or being forced to retrofit existing guns,
<BR>
nor should the cost of this technology be mandated on all new products
<BR>
until it is a sufficiently small fraction of the unit cost as to be
<BR>
affordable to the average person. Adding $500-1000 to the cost of a
<BR>
$200-500 product is prohibitive and is only intended to make the product
<BR>
unaffordable to those who need it most.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is no different that seeking a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new car with airbags and seatbelts, even though it is impractical or even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; undesirable to install those devices in older cars.  I dream of one day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having a &quot;full set&quot; of Corvettes - at least one from each of the five major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generations (to date).  It would be blasphemy to retrofit a well-preserved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1957 Corvette with seatblets, airbags and active handling control.  But that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't stop me from expecting to find such devices in a 2000 model year C-5.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Likewise, it's hard to imagine that I would ever want to retrofit my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mint-condition 1953 SKS with a &quot;smart-gun&quot; module.  (But I can see putting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one on my later-model Chinese SK that's already been pretty well bastardized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into a utilitarian saddle-pack brush gun.)
</EM><BR>
<P>However, would you object to laws being passed that made it illegal for
<BR>
you to drive your vintage corvettes on the roads? I didn't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The other question - mandating &quot;smart gun&quot; tech by law - isn't NECESSARILY a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simple binary one of intrusive state power versus the liberty of gun owners.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The common law of negligence can act as an evolutionary motor for &quot;mandating&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incremental employment of improved safety devices through changing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perceptions of &quot;state of the art&quot; and the gradual imposition of civil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liability on those who do not keep up and thereby cause harm to others.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this regard I point you to my discussion of the use of this principle by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distinguished Judge Learned Hand (yes, there was such a man) in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; celebrated case of The T.J. Hooper.  You can find a discussion of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process and the T.J. Hooper case in a paper I delivered at the 1998 Foresight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Senior Associates Gathering:

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thus I can envision a time when it would be negligent to not make a weapon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that was &quot;loyal&quot; to its owner.  It might well not be considered negligent to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;upgrade&quot; legitimate antique weapons, but the standards for their use would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then be much higher.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since older weapons would not be considered useful for self defense
<BR>
purposes, and alteration would significantly impact upon their value, I
<BR>
can imagine that it might be possible to make ammunition which is smart
<BR>
for use in these guns, that the ammo would have to be electronically
<BR>
'primed' prior to use, and that the 'priming' effect would only last a
<BR>
certain time period, at which time the ammo would have to be rebooted or
<BR>
reprimed. Making this a process that you have to do round by round and
<BR>
reducing the priming effect to an hour or two would detract from their
<BR>
use as a self defence weapon (much as muzzle loading is now to
<BR>
timeconsuming to be useful), so people would be encouraged to utilize
<BR>
the newer smart technologies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The fact is that the 'smart'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  technologies that are out right now are highly restrictive, highly prone to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  failure, and add a minimum of $1000.00 on the price of any given gun. When
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; your average pistol costs $350.00-450.00, putting what amounts to a 200% tax &gt; &gt; on the gun only does one thing: it makes it impossible for poor people, who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are most likely to live in high crime areas and are most freqently victims of &gt; &gt; crime and are most likely of a minority group), to defend themselves against &gt; &gt; crime. This is an elitist and racist policy to propose until it can be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; afforded by all. The dirty little secret of the Democratic Party is that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gun control laws passed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  prior to 1950 were part of Jim Crow legislation. What cop is gonna let a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; black man carry a gun?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All these points fit neatly into the kind of analysis one finds in the T.J.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hooper: You make a good case that the technology has not yet evolved to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point where we can fairly consider it to be the state of the art.  On the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other hand, such arguments shouldn't be taken to be conclusive against the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impetus to continue developing that art - which I don't think you do.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't. However, the argument that most litigants are making these days
<BR>
is if the technology is merely possible that it should be mandatory, no
<BR>
matter what the cost. This I find wholly unreasonable and intolerable.
<BR>
<P>The latest law in Taxachusetts mandates that all handguns be sold with
<BR>
many features which are not even currently in existence. The inventory
<BR>
of every gun dealer in the state is now unsalable. Many are moving out
<BR>
of state. You must keep trigger locks on even the most ancient and
<BR>
unusable firearms, revolutionary war muskets, etc. Massachusetts has
<BR>
evolved from a Commonwealth to a People's Republic. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Back to the cost: Those that claim the logic can be designed into a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; chip and made for a few cents are thinking in the wrong scale. Chip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efficiencies of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  scale of this magnitude occur when you reach hundreds of thousands, if not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  millions of units each year. While a couple million guns are sold each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; year in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the US at most, they are made by several dozen gun manufacturers. Each one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of these manufacturers will have to come up with its own chip design (if not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; multiple chip designs), since sharing designs like this is collusion and an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anti-trust actionable offense. Each manufacturer will never make more than a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hundred thousand or so chips a year. For those of you in chip design, who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mightwant to advance gun technology so that it is affordable, I suggest you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make a chip design, and make it free and open source like linux is, start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; manufacturing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  up, and get the prices down. And design it so that the government can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; useit as a means of gun control/registration/permitting.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think you're right about all this, but that an advanced MEMS robotics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology could make a &quot;smart trigger guard&quot; practicable at a reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost.  Sketching designs for such devices in my mind has become a drive-time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pastime for me lately.  A key to this would be the development of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general-purpose &quot;recognizer&quot; chip, that would have uses in many applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beyond &quot;smart gun&quot; tech, and therefore could become inexpensive with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economies of scale from general demand from those other uses.  This would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coupled with a &quot;trigger-inhibitor&quot; arm that would consist of an array of MEMS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lever arms.  This latter device would also be able to use many components
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that would be useful in broader applications.  The only unique characteristic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be the general arrangement of these components.  Newly manufactured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weapons could incorporate these components seamlessly into the general body
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the firearm, while retrofit kits might be somewhat more clunky.  In any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case, I don't see why a smart gun couldn't become an acceptable definition of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the state of the art in time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Neither do I, however they need to be a lot smarter than what current
<BR>
legislation and litigation seems to think is acceptable, and more
<BR>
affordable as well. The current hysteria is merely due to media hype,
<BR>
the liberals thinking that they've now got the 2nd amendment on its last
<BR>
legs. They know they've got trouble coming down the pike in US v.
<BR>
Emerson, which could put a lot of their gun laws out the window, so they
<BR>
are trying to raise the mass hysteria level high enough so they can pass
<BR>
an amendement overriding the 2nd.
