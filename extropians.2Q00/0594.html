<EM>&gt; &gt; People who live in liberal democracies tend to forget about the violent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; basis of government power, because it is usually hidden beneath a veil of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; civility and bland legalisms. But that doesn't mean it isn't there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Democratic governments kill their citizens all the time (just ask a drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dealer). Usually they direct their violence against 'criminals', which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what makes them better than police states - but you have to remember that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the government gets to define who is and is not a 'criminal', and the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; real limit to what it can do is the willingness of the general public to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; acquiesce.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All real power is based in force or the threat of force,
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it isn't. Those who try to ignore the objective reality of natural
<BR>
law have to use force to fight against that objective reality.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and all I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think you're pointing out here is that we've granted a monopoly on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physical coercion to our elected government. That's treacherous, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, like any concentration of power, but in the end I don't see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what the other options would be. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Some of the most peaceful and prosperous countries are those with little
<BR>
professional military, and highly distributed and decentralized power
<BR>
structures, where the average citizen posesses the ability to bring a
<BR>
significant amount of force to bear if needed. Switzerland, for example,
<BR>
and the US (parts that don't have gun control) and New Zealand to lesser
<BR>
degrees. Centralized power structures benefit nobody but themselves and
<BR>
their further pepetuation and growth. There are always options.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I like the idea of collaborative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anarchy - it would be great if we were all equals and we could mediate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all our differences from bargaining positions of equal strength, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't believe it works. No one stays equal - you get kings,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; syndicates, warring city states - you get power which is unaccountable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the people living under it. And that power preserves and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strengthens itself and wipes out threats to it's survival.
</EM><BR>
<P>So as I've said, people who think like you buy the precept of &quot;People
<BR>
are no damn good and need to be kept penned up for their 'own good'.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; While we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; differ over whether it's been excessive, I'm sure you'd agree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft has been a vicious competitor. I shudder to think what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world would be like if they and institutions like them could raise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; private armies to wage wars against competitors, strike contracts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with private police agencies to search your home for pirated software,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conduct tariff negotiations via cruise missile, etc. This is obviously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a bit hyperbolic, but it at least evokes my vision of the nation without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some ultimate, constitutionally restrained, publicly elected and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; publicly accountable authority. But maybe I'm cynical or got beat up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one to many times in high-school.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I certainly don't think our government is perfect - drug laws, as you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned, are a great example. I'm writing from New York State where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we live under the Rockerfeller Laws - extraordinarily harsh, mandatory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sentences for trivial drug offenses, deliberately designed to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guilty pleas and bypass the pesky impediments to justice posed by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right to trial and the presumption of innocence.
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't understand your own system. Your system is structured to
<BR>
maximize the possible bribes that dumb middle class and wealthy people
<BR>
have to pay to cops, prosecutors, and mayors in order to get off or get
<BR>
light sentences when they break the law. Since there are SO many laws in
<BR>
NY, the average person can easily be found to be in violation of any
<BR>
number of laws without knowing it, and that makes the average person on
<BR>
the street and easy victim for a police shakedown.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And I'm fairly irked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by paying $5 for a $1 pack of cigarettes because our leaders, in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great and abiding wisdom, have decided smoking is bad for me and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ought to be dissuaded or punished for a character flaw.
</EM><BR>
<P>You aren't being punished, you are paying for the 'cost to society' that
<BR>
your bad habit imposes, both environmentally and on the social welfare
<BR>
health care system, don't you KNOW that??? C'mon, you're a loyal New
<BR>
Yorker, thats why you people are suing gun manufacturers too....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though - our government is, at least in principle, bound by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constitution and accountability to the electorate.
</EM><BR>
<P>What is supposed to be and what is are completely different. &quot;It depends
<BR>
on what the meaning of 'is' is.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Business has no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such restrictions - it's only charter is to maximize it's stock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; holders value and the only constraints on how it does that are those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imposed by power from above. Without federal power to protect them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the principles of our democracy are bullshit. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Bullshit yourself. The principles of our democracy have gotten run over
<BR>
roughshod by the federal government for the last 3/4 century.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Private interests have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no obligation to observe them. Of course I have reservations, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we've had 200 hundred years of smooth transition of power, relative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom and reasonable domestic tranquility.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I object to the us-versus-them character that discussion of government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has in so many of these debates. Government is us - it's elected by us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and made up of us - it's not some alien force, some evil monster out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to crush all that's good and free in the world. I have faith that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people in government are just like you and me, and most of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe in what they're doing and honesty feel they're doing what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right - even when I disagree with them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Government is not US, its 50.00000001% of us crushing everyone else.
<BR>
Thats the central fallacy of democracy. It doesn't represent everyone,
<BR>
just those who voted for whoever is in power.
