Another company is caught spying on your PC.  RealNetworks installs a
<BR>
&quot;Download Demon&quot; on your PC when you download their free players.  It
<BR>
records every download you make from the Internet and reports it back to
<BR>
RealNetwork for marketing purposes.
<BR>
<P>Why do companies think they have the right to do this?  I am seeing more and
<BR>
more of this!

&gt; &gt; Subject: RealNetworks Returns: The &quot;Spy&quot; in &quot;Download Demon&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Greetings.  You'd think they'd have learned by now.  After their public
&gt; &gt; relations snafus with the Globally Unique Identifier in their RealPlayer
&gt; &gt; product, and concerns over information being transmitted to Real by
their
&gt; &gt; RealJukebox package, one would have hoped that they'd figured out how
&gt; folks
&gt; &gt; feel about their activities being monitored, even when the monitoring is
&gt; &gt; theoretically anonymous.  After all, RealNetworks, Inc.
&gt; &gt; (<A HREF="http://www.real.com">http://www.real.com</A>) takes pains to mention that they're a member of
the
&gt; &gt; Online Privacy Alliance, whose stated aim is to &quot;... create an
environment
&gt; &gt; of trust and foster the protection of individuals' privacy online.&quot;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But it's hard not to mutter some choice expletives under your breath
upon
&gt; &gt; learning the details of RealNetwork's latest heavily-promoted goodie
from
&gt; &gt; their Netzip, Inc. (<A HREF="http://www.netzip.com">http://www.netzip.com</A>) subsidiary--the &quot;Download
&gt; Demon&quot;
&gt; &gt; package.  Actually, Real should win the &quot;honesty in product naming&quot;
award
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; this one--&quot;demon&quot; seems to be a particularly apt description.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You may already have stumbled across this little surprise on your
system.
&gt; &gt; I found it apparently bundled in with other downloads I had made from
&gt; &gt; RealNetworks.  The Download Demon attempts to automate various file
&gt; &gt; downloading functions, to permit downloads to be interrupted and later
&gt; &gt; resumed, plus other related functionality.  It attracted my attention
&gt; since
&gt; &gt; it had silently linked itself into my Web browsers to take over all
&gt; &gt; downloading operations--*without* my having taken any specific actions
to
&gt; &gt; install or enable it--and my system was hanging in the course of various
&gt; &gt; downloads!  I removed it with some difficulty.  Only later did I
discover
&gt; &gt; the much less obvious &quot;feature&quot; of the Download Demon--for all files you
&gt; &gt; download, from *any* sites, the Demon sends details (e.g. file names and
&gt; &gt; URLs) to RealNetworks/Netzip!  Surprise!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'll give them some credit--at least this is all spelled out in their
&gt; &gt; privacy policy (<A HREF="http://www.netzip.com/about/privacy.html">http://www.netzip.com/about/privacy.html</A>).  Of course,
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; assumes that you thought to even bother reading a privacy policy for a
&gt; &gt; &quot;simple&quot; downloading package, or had the time to plow through the entire
&gt; &gt; lengthy document (which of course is subject to change at any time).
&gt; &gt; A handy attorney to help you analyze the policy might also be useful.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Real makes the usual &quot;you can trust us&quot; sorts of boilerplate statements.
&gt; &gt; They say that they don't store your Internet IP addresses in tandem with
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; data that they record about what you download.  They claim that it's all
&gt; &gt; &quot;anonymous&quot; and that they don't link in personally identifiable
&gt; &gt; information.  The stated purpose for the flow of information about your
&gt; &gt; detailed downloading activities is to target the ads in the &quot;free&quot;
version
&gt; &gt; of the Download Demon software, and for (here it comes) &quot;aggregate,
&gt; &gt; anonymous statistical analysis&quot; purposes.  There is no suggestion that
&gt; this
&gt; &gt; data flow ceases if a user upgrades the product by paying for
registration
&gt; &gt; (to turn off the ads).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This whole area of commercial monitoring of Internet user activity in
&gt; various
&gt; &gt; ways, both in &quot;free&quot; and non-free software, is a gigantic growth
industry,
&gt; &gt; largely fueled by the absence of even basic legislation to provide
&gt; consumers
&gt; &gt; with specific rights in this regard.  Such software packages may
entangle
&gt; &gt; themselves into users' systems in manners that are difficult to notice,
&gt; &gt; understand, control, or remove.  The ongoing controversy over the
&gt; technology
&gt; &gt; used by Radiate, Inc.--formerly Aureate Media (<A HREF="http://www.radiate.com">http://www.radiate.com</A>)
to
&gt; &gt; track various aspects of users' behavior in many popular &quot;freeware&quot;
&gt; software
&gt; &gt; packages is a case in point.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The &quot;trust us, it's anonymous, you have nothing to be concerned about&quot;
&gt; &gt; philosophy expounded in so many complex commercial privacy policies
might
&gt; &gt; satisfy Alfred E. Neuman (&quot;What, me worry?&quot;) of &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; fame, but
&gt; &gt; seems increasingly inadequate for the rest of us.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As far as the &quot;Download Demon&quot; is concerned, if you feel that it's
&gt; &gt; RealNetwork's business to know the details of your file downloads from
&gt; &gt; whatever sites you visit, by all means continue to use it.  If not, you
&gt; may
&gt; &gt; want to consider trying to remove it (in the MS Windows case, via the
&gt; Windows
&gt; &gt; Add/Remove Programs controls), and take care that it isn't automatically
&gt; &gt; installed again in the course of some other software installations.  You
&gt; &gt; might also wish to consider dropping a note to <A HREF="mailto:privacy@netzip.com?Subject=Re:%20RealNetworks%20is%20spying%20on%20Internet%20users%20again&In-Reply-To=&lt;003901bfc985$4bbeebe0$05000100@newstrom&gt;">privacy@netzip.com</A>
letting
&gt; &gt; them know how you feel about these issues, pro or con.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To many firms, the Web has become the vehicle for all manner of invasive
&gt; &gt; systems and policies which few of us would tolerate in the routine,
&gt; &gt; &quot;non-computer&quot; aspects of our lives.  It's up to you to decide whether
or
&gt; &gt; not you wish to passively play along with the salacious circus of
&gt; &gt; software spies.
