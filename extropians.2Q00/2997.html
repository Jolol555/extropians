</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Ahem, as a Swede I don't think that you would like to come to Sweden;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Sweden has some quite bizarre laws about surveillance too... We're not in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;league with the UK yet, but the trend is definitely not a positive one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Overall, since I have visited and resided in the US some times I generally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;think that personal freedom is more respected in many parts the US than in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Sweden.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Just clarifying:-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Surveillance doesn't bother me.  It's Orwellian dystopias I'd rather do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without.  For the record, I don't believe the US is nearly as sinister as,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say, Michael Lorrey does.  But if it were, I'd be heading for the hills
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (whether the hills of Sweden or not, I don't know).
</EM><BR>
<P>The hills of New Hampshire are quite fine, thanks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The fact that the US is one of the biggest emigre destinations on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planet, I think, says a lot about who (as between Lorrey and me) is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right about the nature of the US.  But, hey, in a debate as emotionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charged as this one, who needs to be bogged down with something like factual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality? :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I mean, all those people executed who were later proved innocent
<BR>
are no big deal so long is one of them isn't Zero Powers, right? Heck,
<BR>
the feds don't even need a reason to burn your house down now, it seems,
<BR>
they are even doing it to their own people in Los Alamos now, I hear. Of
<BR>
course, they work on nuclear weapons, so they must deserve it more than
<BR>
the average person. In a country where 'dynamic entry' is now getting to
<BR>
be the most popular way for the feds to serve a warrant, you'd think
<BR>
Zero would start getting a clue, but so long as it isn't happening to
<BR>
him, it seems to be ok, hunky-dory, peachy keen. Now that the Department
<BR>
of Defense has deployed 50 man anti-terror units to every state in the
<BR>
country, who operate outside the authority of the governor and sherriffs
<BR>
of those states (they are under command of the DOD), then the Posse
<BR>
Commitatus Act is pretty much gutted without a congressional debate,
<BR>
huh? Apparently secret Presidential Decrees carry more weight than
<BR>
legislation by our elected representatives? When such Executive Orders
<BR>
become the law of the land, you are, in fact, living in a dictatorship.
<BR>
You may not like it, you may try to deny it, but it is still true.
