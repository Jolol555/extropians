<EM>&gt; I think this needs to be phrased differently.  I can write a program
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to take the square root of a number that the hardware executing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program simply cannot do.  I can also design hardware that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take the square root of a number that would be incapable of executing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said program.  Hardware that can execute programs and compute square
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; roots would by definition be larger than either case separately.
</EM><BR>
<P>That was why I said 'in principle'. The hardware may not have an intrinsic
<BR>
square root operation, but it can simulate one using a series of more
<BR>
elementary operations. Indeed, it must be capable of doing so or it would
<BR>
not be able to run your square root-computing software.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Now, I realize that my statement seems painfully obvious when taken in this
<BR>
sense, especially when we're talking about something as simple as a program
<BR>
to compute square roots. But when you start putting more and more
<BR>
abstraction layers between the hardware and the top layer of your software
<BR>
it becomes very easy to forget that all you're really doing is stringing
<BR>
together elementary hardware operations. Then you get speculations about
<BR>
'virtual storage', 'virtual computers', and all kinds of other cool-sounding
<BR>
stuff that makes no logical sense.
