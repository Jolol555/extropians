<P><EM>&gt;   speaking of &quot;explicitly transhumanist work,&quot; what might some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  those be? it seems to me that all the basic enabling technologies of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  transhuman vision are right on schedule; they are not receiving charity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  but investment capital -- because they give immediate economic payoffs at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  almost every step of the way. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   what then constitutes explicitly transhumanist work? without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  slowing down my typing, i might think of three: 1. increasing public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  awareness of the coming tide; 2. catalyzing more integrated and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  cross-disciplinary research; 3. helping those already aware of what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  coming to better prepare for the future. of course, there is also 4.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  forcasting the far-distant future (when i learn how to count again).
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you've identified all but one of the main outlines of &quot;explicitly 
<BR>
transhumanist work&quot;.  I'd add &quot;community building&quot; as another.  This task has 
<BR>
a couple of levels.  On one important level, it's important to work toward 
<BR>
creating a social network for people with transhumanist goals, because most 
<BR>
people need to feel that their values and goals are shared by other people 
<BR>
they know and respect.  Although there are some examples of people who can be 
<BR>
happy and do productive work in social isolation, I think they are the rare 
<BR>
exception, rather than the rule.  At another level, we may well need to 
<BR>
create legal and social structures to protect those who want to forward the 
<BR>
transhumanist agenda from interference from people who will actively try to 
<BR>
stop them.  In the broadest sense, this is the work of building an effective 
<BR>
transhumanist community.
<BR>
<P>The importance of the first task you identify is now becoming very clear, as 
<BR>
reaction against radical technological progress is growing on a number of 
<BR>
fronts and at a number of levels.  In fact, at this point, &quot;awareness&quot; seems 
<BR>
to be far outstripping any kind of real understanding in the media and minds 
<BR>
of the average person.  So, I'd offer a slight modification of that point: 
<BR>
What's important is the illumination of values that make comprehension of the 
<BR>
transhumanist agenda clearer.  This may be what you're talking about in your 
<BR>
third point.
<BR>
<P>Folks like Eric Drexler, Robert Bradbury, Greg Stock and Robert Frietas are 
<BR>
doing a lot on the front of &quot; cross disciplinary research&quot; - at least to 
<BR>
plant seeds of the need for that work.  Within the next five to 10 years, 
<BR>
though, we'll have to start really putting our money where our mouth is, 
<BR>
looking for the creation and funding of real technology development with a 
<BR>
clear transhumanist goal.  This will be a period I liken to the aerodynamic 
<BR>
concept of &quot;Max Q&quot;, or maximum aerodynamic pressure: It will be at that point 
<BR>
that the work we've done up to that point will have to start bearing real 
<BR>
institutional fruit.
