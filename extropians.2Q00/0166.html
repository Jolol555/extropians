<EM>&gt;     &gt;the  President does not make the laws, that is the job of Congress.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And do you really think there is a snowball's chance in hell of Congress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ever passing a law requiring universal surveillance unless they included
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an exception for themselves and the President?
</EM><BR>
<P>Short answer: yes.
<BR>
<P>Long answer: as long as the jobs of politicians depend on pleasing their 
<BR>
constituents, those politicians will have to at least appear to favor 
<BR>
legislation demanded by the people, even if it is contrary to their own 
<BR>
personal interests.  Think term limits and campaign finance reform.  
<BR>
Everybody and their mother on Capitol Hill is clamoring for campaign finance 
<BR>
reform.  Do you think any of them *really* want it?  No.  Will it eventually 
<BR>
be implemented?  What do you think?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; No encryption is unbreakable, that is just a fact.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;No, it is not a fact. Quantum Encryption, which has actually been used in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a commercial setting not just in the lab, is as secure as the laws of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;physics.
</EM><BR>
<P>*That* is news to me.  Do you know where I can find out more about this 
<BR>
quantum encryption?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;Further, if such cypherpunk activities are criminalized, the very act 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;attempting to use encryption for the purpose of tampering with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;public record would likely be construed to be a forfeiture of your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think you need to learn a little more about cryptography. There are ways 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;using DC nets so that you not only don't know what I'm saying you don't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know who I'm talking to. There are ways of using Steganography so you not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only don't know who I'm talking to, you don't even know that I'm talking. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ways of putting information in a form so that it's useful to me and nobody 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or if I prefer, I can make it useful to you and me and nobody else. There 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I can prove that I have a certain piece of secret information without 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;giving you the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;slightest clue as to what that information is.
</EM><BR>
<P>For the criminally inclined, there are always clever ways to commit crimes.  
<BR>
That does not mean that society will not criminalize acts which are 
<BR>
difficult to observe or that law-abiding citizens will adopt criminal 
<BR>
methods, or that the few who do will never be caught.  If you don't mind 
<BR>
living as a criminal I don't mind letting you do it.  But you will get no 
<BR>
sympathy from me when you are caught and punished.
