<P><EM>&gt;Amara:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I LOVED your post.  It echoes something I've come to appreciate in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the last  couple of years, especially the last few months; that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that consciously cultivating behavior aimed at a SLOWER pace has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;substantial benefits in many aspects of my life.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have undertaken a LBYM (live below your means) lifestyle for the
<BR>
last several months, and would like to sing it's praises.
<BR>
<P>I recently finished Thomas Stanley's &quot;The Millionare Next Door&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;The Millionare Mind&quot;. Both books deal with his extensive research
<BR>
on millionares, who they are and how they got there. His main point
<BR>
is that the vast majority got there in this lifetime, on their own.
<BR>
They stay married to the same person for life, and they are very
<BR>
pragmatic about spending money. They are not at all what we have
<BR>
come to expect via the media.
<BR>
<P>I am currently pursuing a more advanced state of what could be
<BR>
termed &quot;voluntary simplicity&quot; in pursuit of this goal.
<BR>
