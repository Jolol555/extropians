<P><EM>&gt; &gt;But it is equally important to point out that sprituality doesn't have have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a thing to do with religion. All to often, religions get a walk- over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;victory when it comes to sprititual things. I see sprituality as something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that gratifies you emotionally, and that could be consumerism for instance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought that spiritualism was the ability to be self-disciplined allowing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you NOT to have to rely on material thrills. Surely it is normally seen as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;opium&quot; or compensation for the dispossesed who cannot buy themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instant gratification?
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree. Spiritualism, as I use the word, deals with what we
<BR>
consider central, meaningful, sacred. That can of course be expressed
<BR>
by self-discipline, but it could just as well be expressed by sacred
<BR>
hedonism or making grandiose amounts of money. It all depends on the
<BR>
central values of a person. It is just that the ascetics somehow got
<BR>
better PR :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes, I think there is some mileage in comparing virtual reality computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (game) worlds with  magickal and spiritual questings and vision. Hypnotic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and psychological addiction  applies to both technology and shamanism. Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; techno-paganism doesn't seem pan out is that the essential link with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *nature* is broken .... so unless you take your notebook to a remote glade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or desert wilderness then light a bonfire to feel more in touvch with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elements ... I find it hard to take techno-shamanists seriously!
</EM><BR>
<P>Isn't this an unnecessarily dualist view? After all, New York city is
<BR>
also nature.
<BR>
<P>Of course, that doesn't mean that much of technoshamanism isn't silly,
<BR>
but I think the real problem is that people mainly play with it, just
<BR>
thrilling of doing something that is against the old traditions but
<BR>
not really daring to invent a new one. A bit like the cyberpunk
<BR>
movement before it died.  The real issues of making a good spiritual
<BR>
system are unity, completeness, consistency and all that. That takes a
<BR>
lot of work and dedication.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Science is the yoga of the West :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certainly they both have longevity, better mental functioning/ wisdom and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good health as core aims.
</EM><BR>
<P>It can be deeper than that - the above is just exoteric stuff, nice
<BR>
side effects of something more profound. After all, a yoga master
<BR>
wouldn't say the goal of yoga is to produce somebody who can sit in
<BR>
meditation for days without getting aches, just as many scientists
<BR>
would not say that the real reason they try to understand the world is
<BR>
to make a better sun lotion. There are of course some such yoga masters
<BR>
and scientists, but there are also spiritual (in my meaning of the
<BR>
word) motivations involved.
