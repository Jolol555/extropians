<P><EM>&gt; Also, we should raise standards for our expectations of TV SF.  I was not

<EM>&gt; landscape was like, but there's been a lot of stuff since then.  Sadly,

<EM>&gt; though TV science fiction remains way below what it could be.  How can we

<P>I've had several ideas for a Sci-Fi show running around my brain for years now.
<BR>
The first is now a bit dated, but it would primarily be a social sci-fi show.
<BR>
The basic premise takes place at varying times after several hundred large-scale
<BR>
Colony-Ships leave the solar system after a devastating war in the late 21st
<BR>
Century.  Each Colony-Ship is a large self-contained space colony of 10,000+
<BR>
people centered around particular beliefs- religious, political, apolitcal,
<BR>
scientific, vegetarian, etc.  I was trying to think of a series that would give
<BR>
the writers ample room to play around with diverse and experimental social
<BR>
structures and examine possible outcomes of such beliefs.
<BR>
<P>The second show is something based on a story I've been writing for over a year
<BR>
now.  Without giving too much away, the show would take place after a
<BR>
Singularity has occurred - that means post-uploading, post-human.  The first
<BR>
episode centers around one of the main characters who had himself cryonically
<BR>
frozen back on Earth around 2011.  He was part of a new cryonics company that
<BR>
set up a self-powering cryonics system powered by geothermal variants and placed
<BR>
deep underground in the Alaska wilderness. Unfortunately this facility was
<BR>
completely forgotten, during a wide scale nanowar in the 2020's.  Now in the
<BR>
year 2075, those who made it have all become conscious software in a
<BR>
solar-system wide 'matrix'.  The frozen characters brain is fully scanned and
<BR>
uploaded.  Before reviving his consciousness his memories are scanned, and the
<BR>
most suitable environment is found in which to wake him.  In this case the farm
<BR>
he grew up on in Colorado.  The first season would take place during a
<BR>
subjective year of this characters life and other conscious software that he
<BR>
meets.  Slowly over the series his idea and ours of what reality is will slowly
<BR>
expand giving him and us a chance to adapt to life in a post-human state.  By
<BR>
the end of the first season, this character will still live in scapes closely
<BR>
resembling earthlike conditions, but he will taking flying as the normal mode in
<BR>
which to experience them and interface with this larger matrix that is this
<BR>
post-human solar system wide network beginning to explore the cosmos via
<BR>
traversible wormholes.
