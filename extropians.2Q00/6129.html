<P>
Harvey,
<BR>
<P>Thank you so much for your thoughtful, impartial, and I hope
<BR>
ultimately helpful summary and suggestion.

<P><EM>&gt; The very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact that all postings are being made publicly is because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; participants are no longer speaking to each other, but are posting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exposition to the rest of the list.  Each side is casting their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; position in the best light, while casting the opposing position in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the worst light.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I see (unintentional) exaggeration and misinterpretation on both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sides. Although not deliberate, both sides have reacted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disproportionately to certain statements.  Items that were minor or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meaningless have been taken as intentional insults.  Attacks have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been made upon some statements that were throw-away lines or even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unrelated or content-free filler.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P>People can do all these things when pressed in certain ways. I
<BR>
think it's important to see these traits as general, and not the
<BR>
sole possession of a &quot;drunk&quot; (as one of my anonymous
<BR>
correspondents suggested).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This really should be taken off-line.  The postings made for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefit of the list audience have distorted the discussion beyond all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recognition.  I suggest that all three parties apologize to the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for having a heated discussion in the public forum.
</EM><BR>
<P>I apologize to the list(s) for my part in this mess. Personally,
<BR>
I don't think public conflict is always bad. My experience is
<BR>
that one -- if not all involved -- often comes out the other
<BR>
side much improved. But 1) I think it seems very unlikely this
<BR>
will happen in the case at hnd; and 2) I haven't been
<BR>
sufficiently sensitive to others' _different_ views on the value
<BR>
of conflict. Given that it actually started seeming likely to be
<BR>
unproductive earlier, an apology is most definitely in order.
<BR>
Again: I'm sorry, and I shall do my best to be certain not to
<BR>
allow this to happen again.
<BR>
<P>Towards the Good,
<BR>
Brian.
<BR>
