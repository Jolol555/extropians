<P><EM>&gt; As you point out, Robert, huge sums of money are already being diverted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  health and longevity issues. In fact the desire for longevity is so obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and the profits so sure, that it doesn't seem to me that anything other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  than the market is needed to make it happen. Do you feel that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  marketplace is not going to provide the advances needed, and do you feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that a NGO could assign money to the correct labs that the market is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  going to fund?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I am not suggesting that health and longevity is not the highest priority;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  only that it is a priority already being served ( not perfectly) by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  investments. But there are other endeavors that are not being and won't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  served by the market. These are the leverage points.
</EM><BR>
<P>As other have pointed out, at this point, it's not so much money that needs 
<BR>
to be directed to specific research initiatives, so much as money that needs 
<BR>
to be invested in cultural change.  As you might expect, extropians are 
<BR>
particularly sensitive to the nuances of how new scientific and technological 
<BR>
breakthroughs in the bio-sciences, especially those dealing with longevity 
<BR>
research are announced and discussed.  Over the last couple of years, 
<BR>
especially, we've increasingly noticed what you might call a &quot;shyness&quot; or 
<BR>
reticence to discuss the real implications of work on things like telomere 
<BR>
shortening and other genetics breakthroughs, by the people who are doing this 
<BR>
work.  Part of this can be accounted for by laudable scientific humility and 
<BR>
caution.  But the unwillingness to come out and say that a particular new 
<BR>
development has real implications for increasing human longevity seems to go 
<BR>
beyond this.  To many of us, it looks like FEAR, fear of challenging the deep 
<BR>
and universal assumptions in all human cultures about human limits.  Outside 
<BR>
of a very few &quot;visionaries&quot;, discussion of any kind of augmentation of the 
<BR>
human animal is simply taboo among serious researchers.  This is like 
<BR>
physicists and engineers at the turn of the 20th century not being able to 
<BR>
talk about heavier-than-air flight. 
<BR>
<P>Although this cultural barrier has probably not yet thrown up any real 
<BR>
impediment to progress toward advances in human longevity or other kinds of 
<BR>
augmentation, the time will come fairly soon when it will.  Progress in the 
<BR>
laboratory and the clinic will, within the next five years, begin to hit the 
<BR>
limits of what can be done without open definition and discussion of the goal 
<BR>
of real augmentation of the human animal.  The time to address this problem 
<BR>
is now.  It will take money to push discussion and defense of this agenda 
<BR>
outside of relatively small &quot;techno-visionary&quot; communities such as Extropy 
<BR>
Institute and the core founders of the Foresight Institute.  People who 
<BR>
really believe in this agenda need to invest in a cultural initiative on many 
<BR>
fronts: Writers need to be supported so that more books can be published; 
<BR>
speakers need to be put out into the public's attention; documentaries need 
<BR>
to be produced for television; specific researchers with the courage to 
<BR>
identify human augmentation as their goal need to be encouraged that their 
<BR>
work won't be stifled by fear and superstition.  Entities like Extropy 
<BR>
Institute and Foresight do this work, but they need more money to carry the 
<BR>
message to a wider audience.  So, I would say that some of the best money one 
<BR>
can invest now in a truly bright future for humanity is to increase levels of 
<BR>
support for these incubators.
