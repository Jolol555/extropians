<EM>&gt; Actually, Germany does have a much lower incidence. However, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; notice he only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said murder. What about manslaughter and other forms of illegal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; homicide? Also,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what are the property crime rates? I notice you left those out,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as well as other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violent crime, including non-gun violent crime, like rape, assault,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manslaughter, negligent homicide, etc. What are the rates of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; burglary, robbery,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; larceny and car theft?
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, I took one representative crime out of a greater variety, as I did not
<BR>
take the time to study the annual reports in every detail. I will do this,
<BR>
as I have downloaded the documents, but I doubt that this will reveal
<BR>
anything really new.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, this discussion might prove quite valuable for me, as we have a hot
<BR>
discussion on this at University. In Germany, the Anti-Gun faction is very
<BR>
strong and believes in the theory that no guns results in no gun-related
<BR>
crimes. I tried pointing out different but it seems that this is quite a
<BR>
&quot;belief&quot; rather than something rational. As a matter of fact, I am neither
<BR>
pro-gun nor anti-gun, because I do not have enough information to decide on
<BR>
this. One of the key arguments that struck me was the fact, that it is
<BR>
usually non-libertarian countries who forbid guns. The Communists and the
<BR>
Nazi are but two excellent examples of political systems who had a great
<BR>
interest in disarming their people.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As I've repeatedly said, comparing the US average murder rate to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a european
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; average is meaningless because the gun laws vary so widely from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state to state,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and those states with the most gun control have the highest rates. If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; divided US states up between those with strict gun control, and those with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liberal gun laws, then do your comparison, you will find that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controlling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; states are the greatest contributors to the overall US crime rate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Though I have a list of the crimes per state and per city (for the bigger
<BR>
ones) I lack a corresponding list with the gun control laws so I could do
<BR>
this comparison. But I'm sure something like that can be found on the net.
<BR>
It is indeed a big problem of comparing the two continents. Anyway, the
<BR>
social differences are big and so I doubt that we would get to good results
<BR>
using this method. But as I would like to present this to my course, could
<BR>
you perhaps give me your source of data or a hint where I can find facts to
<BR>
prove your theory?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Claiming that only states with big cities have high crime is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incorrect, as there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are plenty of big cities with liberal gun laws in states with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liberal gun laws
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that have low crime rates. Another thing you can do is look at counties of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; similar size and area, that are part of the metro area of a big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; city, but are in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different states with different gun laws. You can compare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rockingham County, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; New Hapmshire and Middlesex County in Massachusetts, for example,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or counties in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Virginia and Maryland that surround Washington DC, or counties in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Missouri and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kansas surrounding Kansas City...
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, there's a word: I trust only in the statistics I have falsified
<BR>
myself. I have studied political economics before switching to law, and my
<BR>
statistics teacher began his second course with the book &quot;How to lie with
<BR>
statistics&quot;. It was very, very interesting to see how this can work. As most
<BR>
people do not understand this, they put a blind trust in anything that is
<BR>
shown with numbers.
