<P>
In my opinion, the clearest place where Mother Theresa was always in
<BR>
the wrong was that she focused exclusively on the symptoms (which
<BR>
appear on the powerless) and always ignored the causes (which stemmed
<BR>
from the powerful).   She never advocated change.  She didn't
<BR>
nurse people back to health and send them forth, revitalized and
<BR>
inspired to change things.  I find this very, very, hard to
<BR>
understand.  Perhaps she had the karmic wheel too close to her heart,
<BR>
that and the post-Roman Christianity of 'turn the other cheek.' 
<BR>
Neitzche spoke of Christianity as a slave religion, and the history
<BR>
certainly supports him.
<BR>
<P>Patching-up the wounded doesn't do much good, and in fact always
<BR>
lets problems become worse, unless the causes are addressed.   I
<BR>
think she was not a brave person at all, and also very blind to her
<BR>
function as an enabler of stasis.  She doesn't compare well to
<BR>
Ghandi, who actually did change the world, despite his human lacks.
<BR>
<P>That said, she's a powerful icon of simple human empathy, and I don't
<BR>
mean to detract from that.  Wisdom and bravery I would not attribute
<BR>
to her.  She was always trying to cure the symptoms, which is
<BR>
something that isn't just a lost cause, it logically cannot be done,
<BR>
and someone who doesn't at least begin to suspect that after a
<BR>
lifetime of work is someone I don't understand at all.
