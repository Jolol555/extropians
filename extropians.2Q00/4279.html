<P><P><EM>  &gt;One possibility to imagine is that for any present that there are a nearly infinite
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;number of immediately following events depending on actions taken, here visualized
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;as an infinite set of probability chains or threads from a point in time to the next
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;for any number of &quot;parallel&quot; spacetimes.  So, if the message warns not to break the
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;cup, and it isn't, then in one spacetime the cup was broken, and the other it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt;not.  This action might actually generate the alternate spacetimes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, this subject has come up before, this is part of a post I sent to the list a few
<BR>
years ago:
<BR>
<P>==================================================================
<BR>
Actually relativity does not forbid matter moving faster than light, it forbids
<BR>
matter moving  AT the speed of light because that would take infinite energy.
<BR>
That's almost the same thing but not quite. Perhaps a particle could somehow
<BR>
tunnel past the speed of light or maybe Tachyons have always moved faster
<BR>
than light from the first instant of The Big Bang.
<BR>
<P>People have looked for Tachyons but have never found the slightest evidence
<BR>
that they exist in nature, much to the relief of physicists. Tachyons are an
<BR>
embarrassment, the faster they move less energy they have, one that moved
<BR>
just a little faster than light would have a lot of energy, one that moved at an
<BR>
infinite velocity would have zero energy. Much worse, Tachyons move backward
<BR>
in time, they arrive at their destination before they start. You could
<BR>
communicate with the past.
<BR>
<P>Even though they have never been detected and the laws of physics do not
<BR>
demand that Tachyons exist, they don't seem to forbid them either. Most think
<BR>
nature is totalitarian, if it's not forbidden then it's mandatory.
<BR>
<P>What about the logical paradoxes that would result from communicating with
<BR>
the past, wouldn't that be enough to rule out Tachyons? It would if anybody
<BR>
saw them, but suppose nature rubbed out any witnesses to her crime and
<BR>
brought a universe to an end that was about to see a paradox.
<BR>
<P>Damn, I just knocked my coffee cup off the table, what a mess! I'm really not
<BR>
in the mood to clean it up, instead I'll use my Gateway 14,400 Tachyon modem
<BR>
and send myself some E mail 2 minutes ago. I'll just hit the send key and
<BR>
<P>.....brought a universe to an end that was about to see a paradox. Pardon me,
<BR>
I just got some E mail from John, let's see what it says &quot; Dear John: Be
<BR>
careful with that coffee cup near your elbow, you're about to knock it over.&quot;
<BR>
Wow, John is right, that cup is dangerously near the edge, I'll put it in a
<BR>
safe place. It was nice of John to warn me about it, it's too bad that means
<BR>
oblivion for him and his entire universe but that's life, nature just will
<BR>
not allow anybody to observe a paradox.
<BR>
<P>I know what you're thinking, how could John be so stupid, he must be
<BR>
completely out of his mind, why else would he deliberately buy an obsolete
<BR>
14,400 Tachyon modem? Well, call me cheap if you want but I still think the
<BR>
28,800 model is too expensive, besides I have it on very good authority that
<BR>
Gateway will drop the price next year.
