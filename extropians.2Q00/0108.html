<EM>&gt; This is why I state that such technology is USELESS without an overall

<EM>&gt; Without a Big Brother syste, the alleged increase in crime fighting that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance provides is ephemeral, or easily countered.

<P>It's being installed today, in the UK, with widespread public
<BR>
support. (Not from me, I should like to add.)  It's fallible, sure,
<BR>
but with the best part of a million surveilance cameras a year being
<BR>
installed in public places (and a lot of the monitoring outsourced
<BR>
to private companies, and funded by insurance premium reductions)
<BR>
it's eminently economically practical. Add the current Regulation of
<BR>
Investigatory Powers Bill (with its draconian key-disclosure clauses),
<BR>
public paranoia about porn, paedophilia, poor policing, and privacy
<BR>
(this is the culture that invented the net curtain, remember) and you
<BR>
have a mostly-working prototype of the universal surveilance society.
<BR>
<P>Hint: the fact that the UK is highly urbanized helps, as does the
<BR>
existence of a large, socially conservative middle class element
<BR>
who have been left feeling insecure by the rapidity of social change
<BR>
since 1979. The USA is lagging a long way behind the UK in this trend.
<BR>
(Note also that Scotland, with its different legal system from England &amp;
<BR>
Wales, is lagging behind the south in trashing privacy rights. Guess
<BR>
who saw this coming some years ago and moved to Scotland?)
<BR>
<P>Any time you want to check out a total surveilance society in the
<BR>
embryonic phase, hop on a plane for Heathrow airport. Catch the train
<BR>
into London, then get on a double-decker bus. Sit on the top deck, and
<BR>
keep your eyes on the buildings -- you need to be looking about ten feet
<BR>
above ground level if you want to maximize your camera count. If you're
<BR>
feeling particularly dilligent, map your distance travelled and add an
<BR>
extra camera for every shop (coverage is over 90% in most shopping areas
<BR>
now, and some local authorities won't grant planning permission for a new
<BR>
retail development unless it includes CCTV surveilance).
<BR>
<P>This isn't fantasy. This has already happened, in a city I used to live
<BR>
in.
