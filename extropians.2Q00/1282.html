<EM>&gt; Mike, remember the wild west??  Even if everyone carried today, there would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly still be dangerous areas because of the nature of the local 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; populations and the gangs there!  But if you went there with your 'posse' of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; friends and not alone you would have a decent chance of surviving because 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 'bad guys' would not want to risk their lives with such odds.

<P><P>IIRC, the &quot;wild west&quot; had a lower homicide rate than the modern west. 
<BR>
Guns do not equal shootings; the character of the individuals has a lot to
<BR>
do with it.  The old wild west had a rather strong selection pressures
<BR>
against irresponsible behaviors.
<BR>
<P>As a matter of fact, there *are* places where everyone still &quot;packs heat&quot;
<BR>
in the West:  rural Arizona, Nevada, Montana, Idaho, etc.  Guns are to
<BR>
those places like cell phones are to Silicon Valley.  Honestly, I
<BR>
would be much more likely to trust one of the armed strangers in those
<BR>
parts than the unarmed strangers in the more &quot;civilized&quot; areas; I don't
<BR>
fear their guns because I trust their character.  I wish I could say the
<BR>
same about the urban police.
