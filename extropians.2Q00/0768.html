<P>
OK, new/old idea to talk about: mass drivers as launch system.
<BR>
<P>Thanks to my downloaded copy of the CIA World Factbook, I find that there are
<BR>
several locations along the equator where there are islands with peaks of
<BR>
2,000-3,000 meters or more.
<BR>
<P>Lets assume a launch acceleration of 4-6 g's within the rail, and that the
<BR>
launch pod is built with either a scramjet capability or can utilize laser
<BR>
propulsion beams aimed at it from the point at which it exits the linear drive
<BR>
system for second stage propulsion.
<BR>
<P>The rail starts off at a sea floor station, follows the undersea terrain up to
<BR>
the surface at the island coastline, to the peak, and have a 1,000-3,000 meter
<BR>
tower/ramp extension above the peak This reduces tunnelling costs, and takes
<BR>
advantage of sea transportation to allow tube sections to be assembled modularly
<BR>
in an assembly line at a contractors location, then dropped into place.
<BR>
<P>Practical questions:
<BR>
How long does the rail need to be to accelerate up to 2,000, 4,000, 6,000 and
<BR>
8,000 mph respectively?
<BR>
Given these estimated speeds at which the launch vehicle might exit the rail,
<BR>
how does this affect the needed mass ratio of the vehicle for second stage
<BR>
propulsion, and would laser propulsion be sufficient for this second stage
<BR>
propulsion?
<BR>
<P>The launch vehicle I am thinking of is long and narrow, with ring lifting
<BR>
surfaces around the vehicle, fore and aft, and the rear ring wing also acts in
<BR>
concert with a scramjet/aerospike type assembly for propulsion. The rings
<BR>
contain coils used in the mass driver stage for acceleration.
