<EM>&gt; &gt; Microsoft _can_ side-step an EU anti-trust investigation -- all they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to do is stop selling Windows anywhere in the EU, at which point they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; aren't a monopoly any more. If they _want_ to sell Windows in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; environment ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So if MS only sells to the euro market via internet downloads.... what possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actions can the eu countries take?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Several, without even insisting that all European ISPs block Microsoft's
<BR>
web sites.
<BR>
<P>They can issue a court order for damages. If a criminal offense is found
<BR>
to have happened -- such as a conviction for bribery -- they can issue
<BR>
an extradition warrant and the US government _will_ cooperate with that
<BR>
(as a quid pro quo for delivering fugitive American criminals back to
<BR>
their own jurisdiction).
<BR>
<P>They can ban the use of Microsoft products from all government and
<BR>
government funded organisations -- right down to the file format
<BR>
level. It'll hurt in the short term, but what do you think the long-term
<BR>
prospects would be for Corel, Apple, Red Hat, if suddenly Microsoft was
<BR>
banned from European government bureacracies? It'd knock a major plank
<BR>
out from the raft of network externalities that shore up Microsoft's
<BR>
retail sales base. 
<BR>
<P>Moreover, some of Microsoft's products aren't downloadable over the web.
<BR>
Knock out the MCSE training/certification network in Europe and qualified
<BR>
support for Microsoft's remaining products would dwindle.
<BR>
<P>None of this would amount to decreeing that some other supplier of choice
<BR>
would take over from Microsoft; it merely amounts to the point that it is
<BR>
difficult to sell to a hostile market, and the EU governments would suddenly
<BR>
become such a market, and a lot of the non-governmental sector would follow
<BR>
their lead. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Quite possibly, knowing the French ... but remember, Microsoft is behaving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; extra-territorially. In the event, I expect they'll just lock up the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; directors of Microsoft's French subsidiary, and/or fine the company, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; maybe put out an extradition warrant for Bill.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not the worlds biggest fan of Bill Gates, but even I can tell you that if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; French try something like this, its gonna piss off a lot of Americans.
</EM><BR>
<P>The French government pisses off a lot of people here, too (but sometimes
<BR>
their ability to insounciantly get right up a deserving nostril earns
<BR>
them fans).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Rest of world != China. Plus, they hardly have a monopoly on it -- they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; merely steal the most of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I merely used them as an example, as I had hoped you could comprehend by the simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; English. Any higher rates for software elsewhere in the world are because of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) added cost of language customization
</EM><BR>
<P>Then why does Windows cost 50% more in the UK? Where piracy levels are
<BR>
zip and there's no import tarrif? (That's the pre-tax cost, BTW.)
<BR>
<P>Clue: Microsoft's grip on the UK market is even tighter than its grip in
<BR>
the US -- the Mac platform never caught on over here.
