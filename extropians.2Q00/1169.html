<EM>&gt; Anyone who orders the bombing of a plane carrying hundreds of innocent people

<BR>
Question: did he?
<BR>
<P>I don't believe we have enough evidence to draw that conclusion. 
<BR>
<P>We can be reasonably certain that the Libyan government made lots of loud
<BR>
declarations in the early seventies about hosting liberation movements,
<BR>
some of them of an extremely dodgy nature (and some of them rather
<BR>
less so).  And we _know_ that members of some of those organisations
<BR>
did atrocious things.
<BR>
<P>We are a little less certain that the Libyan government's own agencies
<BR>
planted bombs/committed acts of terrorism abroad. Note also that a number
<BR>
of US proxy states -- notably Israel and the UK -- have gone in for
<BR>
this sort of action, too, up to and including assassination of foreign
<BR>
nationals on foreign territory. 
<BR>
<P>But confirmation that Ghadaffi personally ordered foreign planes to be
<BR>
blown up in flight would be something of a bombshell. It's a bit like
<BR>
blaming Ronald Reagan, personally, for the shooting down of that Iranian
<BR>
Airlines DC-10 with nearly 300 passengers on board round about 1986.
<BR>
<P>And, if you're thinking about Lockerbie, it's worth bearing the alternative
<BR>
theories in mind. (You know exactly who was _supposed_ to be on board 
<BR>
Pan Am 109, but cancelled his party's reservation an hour before takeoff
<BR>
and caught the next flight?)
<BR>
<P>Clue: here in Scotland, 90% of the informed opinion is that the Lockerbie
<BR>
trial will deliver one of two verdicts -- &quot;not guilty&quot; or &quot;not proven&quot;.
