<EM>&gt; &gt; Morpheus' explaination might be looked at as a reflection of how well any opponent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; truly knows their enemy. Most conflict comes from misunderstanding, so it only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; follows that the resistance would have an imperfect understanding of their enemy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; especially one so vast as the AI.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The existence of the Oracle could simply be a user interface for a freindly AI that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has hacked the system to genetically engineer Neo. Remeber the warning about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 'indistinguisable from magic'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The Oracle predicted Morpheus' death, which was predictable given his lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; understanding of the enemy. As Sun Tsu said, the path to victory is by knowing your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enemy and knowing yourself. Neo attained a good degree of that understanding in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; end, which is why he was able to win in the end.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But she also predicted that Trinity would fall in love with Neo (long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before any of the storyline), that Neo would have to choose between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Morpheus' life and his own, that he would knock over the vase... yes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm willing to agree on 'sufficiently advanced technology'. But I just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prefer to do it differently, thanks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>It is not that hard to believe that the Oracle could be an AI. Remember
<BR>
that these AIs had complete access to the minds of Neo, Trinity, etc.
<BR>
while they were in the Matrix growing up. The good AI could have built up
<BR>
a &quot;copy&quot; of their minds (think uploading via training neural nets that
<BR>
are hooked directly into your experiences) that it uses to run simulations
<BR>
of what their near term actions will be.
