Hey John
<BR>
<P>A website that address's these ideas <A HREF="http://www.brain.com">http://www.brain.com</A>
<BR>
<P>I think If you were hyper-inteligent you would not concern yourself with 
<BR>
&quot;careers&quot;, workin' for a livin' is the hard way to finance your life. The 
<BR>
most sucessful ppl I've seen are those that play hard in what they enjoy, 
<BR>
and just happen to charge for it.
<BR>
<P>I often muse.. &quot;If I were only just a little bit smarter...&quot;, Also *I have 
<BR>
this feeling that the one day I missed school, was the day they tell 
<BR>
everyone what the critical tricks to life are, and were sworn to silence 
<BR>
about it*
<BR>
<P>So I have at least been .studying. intelligence, and I'm interested in 
<BR>
street smarts or sly savvy, wily cunning, not so much technical knowledge 
<BR>
but, the undocumented tricks to navigating the sea of life, James bond 
<BR>
factor coping skills and James T. Kirk tactics, I think we are loosing &quot;old 
<BR>
grandfather wisdom&quot; in generations, I'm seeing very sparse mentorship.
<BR>
<P>Bandwidth is precious, I want to know how it's done, and I want to know 
<BR>
right now, so cough up the clues baby.
<BR>
<P>A good meditation is, I'f I were more inteligent, what would that be like?
<BR>
