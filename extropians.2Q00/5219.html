<EM>&gt;     &gt; where are you launching [cruse missiles] from? Canada? Mexico?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Submarines and distant airplanes.
</EM><BR>
<P>How many terrorists do you know that have submarines with ranges of more than
<BR>
10,000 miles, can carry (and launch) cruise missiles? None.
<BR>
<P>Airplanes are a much better gamble for terrorists of limited means, however all
<BR>
aircraft have IFF identification transponders. If you are an incoming aircraft
<BR>
who has no IFF, or responds with incorrect IFF coding, you will get intercepted
<BR>
well out to sea. I worked in the 318th FIS back in the 80's, a fighter
<BR>
interceptor F-15 squadron in Tacoma. Air Guard and Reserve units have taken over
<BR>
most interception responsibilities around the country which have two to four
<BR>
planes on constant alert at airports a couple hundred miles apart around the
<BR>
entire border and shoreline, except for at Langley and Andrews AFB, which both
<BR>
have large numbers of full time planes on alert status to cover the DC area. All
<BR>
planes on alert status are kept in condition to take off in less than two
<BR>
minutes notice, fully fueled and armed, with an operational combat radius of
<BR>
1000-1500 miles or more.

<EM>&gt;     &gt; (BTW: Backpack/suitcase bombs are not that small,  or that light)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The US government will admit to having built 400 backpack nukes, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought they might be useful in sabotage if they wanted to destroy something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really big like a major dam. It weighed 58 pounds, could be deployed by one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; man, and exploded with a force of 800 tons of TNT. I'm sure they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; classified stuff that's much better nowadays because that was back in 1964.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since there has been no need, then there has been no new designs. The backpack
<BR>
nukes were specifically developed for Keyhole insurgents to carry behind enemy
<BR>
lines in Europe in the event that the Warsaw Pact tried to take western europe.
<BR>
They were basically there for the expressed purpose of taking out a couple dozen
<BR>
key locations where autobahns and railroads intersect in Germany. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; The testing [X Ray Laser] has all been underground for obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; legal/treaty reasons, but they've been designed with many focusing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; devices on a single bomb.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's not what I've hear, I've heard that the beam had much less power than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expected and nobody had any idea how to aim it to hit a tiny fast moving target
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousands of miles away. That's why the military doesn't talk much about X Ray
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lasers anymore, they've gone back to pushing &quot;smart rocks&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats what I expect you would have heard. Disinformation does wonders. Early
<BR>
tests were for the purposes of learning the practical practice of designing xray
<BR>
waveguide and focusing technologies to the level we've had with optics for
<BR>
decades. Its rather to be expected that early attempts were not near theoretical
<BR>
potentials.
<BR>
<P>The reason they are pushing 'smart rocks' is because rocks are not nuclear
<BR>
weapons, while x-ray lasers are. The treaty restrictions on nukes in space put a
<BR>
significant crimp on using this technology, for sure. Primary plans now for them
<BR>
are to install them on some ICBMs to replace MIRVs that have been removed for
<BR>
treaty reasons, so they can be fast launched on demand into the path of whatever
<BR>
incoming wave of offensive nukes occurs.
<BR>
<P>Besides, in their hearts, soldiers actually dislike nukes intensely. The idea of
<BR>
just tossing rocks around has a much broader appeal...
