<P>
I've stumbled upon the archives of a Mormon Leaders' evolution mail list.
<BR>
You will find their struggle with scientific fact vs. faith intriguing.
<BR>
Here's the link, followed by a recent dialogue.
<BR>
<P>But first, if what I'm doing with this post offends list etiquete, I
<BR>
apologize in advance and beg  you not to read any further:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/kaboom/mail-archives/Eyring-L/0004/">http://www.cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/kaboom/mail-archives/Eyring-L/0004/</A>
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
Well, in case anyone was wondering about the lull in the perennial
<BR>
discussion
<BR>
about evolution, I've been off house hunting in NJ. I'm afraid my limited
<BR>
time schedule is coming back to haunt me, so I will apologize in advance if
<BR>
I am unable to respond to the questions or points that have been raised. In
<BR>
particular, I still need to write a post on GxE as I promised Mel.
<BR>
Hopefully, I'll be able to get to that in the next few days.
<BR>
<P>Carl, in reviewing your last set of email, I've come to the conclusion that
<BR>
our conversation has become pretty diffuse. There are a number of points
<BR>
that I wish very much to rebut, but I am going to suppress this urge so
<BR>
that we can get back on track. Instead, I'm going to focus my response(s)
<BR>
on what I believe are the more important issues/problems.
<BR>
<P>Also, I think it's about time for a subject line change, don'cha think?
<BR>
(been a long time since we've addressed LDS extinction :-) )
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;The only text book that I'm know you've read in its entirety is Li's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _Molecular Evolution_. I can't imagine why Li would discuss this at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What other texts were you thinking of?&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My reference shelf includes books by Dawkins, Dennett, Darwin, Gould and H
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; G
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wells/Huxley, of the ones that represent the conventional viewpoint. Both
</EM><BR>
<P>Having a good library is important when it comes to discussing a subject as
<BR>
complex as Evolution. You seem to have some good books although most of
<BR>
these won't help much with your avowed interest (IMO). For instance,
<BR>
_Origin of Species_, which is a marvelous book, is best appreciated in
<BR>
retrospect, or if you have an instructor who can point out the gems along
<BR>
the way. I'm assuming by &quot;Dawkins&quot; that you are referring to _Climbing Mt.
<BR>
Improbable_ and/or _The Blind Watchmaker_. Fun books with a lot of flavor,
<BR>
but not useful for the serious student, IMO. I'm not familiar with the H.G.
<BR>
Wells text but I have a hard time believing it could serve as anything other
<BR>
than commentary on early aspects of the field.
<BR>
<P>In particular, you seem to be suffering from a lack of basic, introductory
<BR>
information. You could use a good genetics text, possibly a good
<BR>
quantitative genetics text, and you need something in the development
<BR>
category as well. I realize that this is a lot to suggest, but you aren't
<BR>
going to be able to compensate for an information vacuum of this magnitude
<BR>
on Eyring-L. (At the level you wish to take the argument, anyway.) No one
<BR>
has the time to disgorge this much information. If you are really serious
<BR>
about exploring and critiquing evolution, you really need to add a few more
<BR>
books to the library. (Maybe one a year or so.)
<BR>
<P>For the basic genetic text, there are several out there. On my shelf at
<BR>
work, I have one from Russell, and another from Klug and Cummings, and I
<BR>
have a couple more at home. IMO, none of these stands out as far superior
<BR>
to the rest. If you wish to get a book in this area, I can make some
<BR>
recommendations, but you may have better luck asking Chris. For
<BR>
quantitative genetics, the intro text is Falconer &amp; Mackay, but a more
<BR>
comprehensive text would be the two volume Walsh/Lynch text (only one is out
<BR>
so far). However, this book is a challenge. For development, I also don't
<BR>
have any recommendations. I'm most familiar with Gilbert's text, and I
<BR>
wasn't too thrilled with it, but there you go.
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt; I am not discussing skeletal evolution, I am discussing how major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are made in DNA, and that has been the focus all along. I need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; current theory in order to ensure that my concepts are correct.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;Carl, if you are not interested in discussing skeletal evolution, why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you bring up skeletal evolution in hominid (specifically upright
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; walking)?&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am trying to pin down a very slippery subject : can major skeletal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be made with only one or two bp changes in DNA, or is it necessary to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invoke
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regulatory genes, regional genes and specific structural genes to explain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such changes? I suspect the first answer is that we don't know. However
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answer I get is that it could be a single bp, because we do not know if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more may be involved. Hanging on to such an answer seems to be reaching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something that is strongly suspected to be misleading.
</EM><BR>
<P>This isn't a case of either/or.
<BR>
<P>Yes, major skeletal changes can be made with single mutation events (such as
<BR>
point mutation, or TE insertion, in/dels, recombination, etc.). Yes, most
<BR>
of these involve regulatory genes, while probably very very few involve
<BR>
structural genes (the mutants we find are almost invariable in regulatory
<BR>
genes). This said, if you wanted to pin me down on exactly what we know
<BR>
about the source of quantitative variation at the molecular level, I'd
<BR>
probably hedge a bit. So far, what we have is a pile of anecdotal
<BR>
information. I, personally, think it paints a pretty good picture (with
<BR>
some fuzzy edges), but if you surveyed the data, you might reach a different
<BR>
conclusion. As for the single bp mutation question, this is pretty much a
<BR>
non-issue. To just briefly sketch out why this is so, I think you will
<BR>
agree that a single nucleotide change in a gene can have anywhere between no
<BR>
effect to total disruption of function. Therefore, a single bp mutation
<BR>
will have basically the same spectrum (although not necessarily the same
<BR>
distribution) of effect on a regulatory gene as a more complex mutation.
<BR>
The ultimate impact of the mutant will depend on how the regulatory gene
<BR>
operated (I'll come back to this later, since I don't think this is
<BR>
intuitive).
<BR>
<P>About the only type of mutant that a single bp change probably wouldn't be
<BR>
involved in is a mutation which resulted in a *novel* trait. However, keep
<BR>
in mind that 99.99999999% of evolution (yes, I'm pulling this number out of
<BR>
thin air :-) ) has nothing to do with novel trait formation. And I mean
<BR>
this to include macroevolution as well.
<BR>
<P>So where am I getting this from? Well, I grant it's a shot from the hip, but
<BR>
take a look at the tree of life and see if you don't agree. Specifically,
<BR>
pick extant taxa that are related at a level higher than genus (i.e. those
<BR>
that are considered to differ in the macroevolutionary sense). Now ask
<BR>
yourself, how much do they differ phenotypically/developmentally? For
<BR>
instance, compare sample taxa from rodentia, primates and carnivora. Dogs,
<BR>
mice, humans all have the same basic organ systems. E.g., our musculature,
<BR>
nervous system, vasculature, digestive track and skeletal systems are
<BR>
virtually identical (apart from scaling aspects). There *are* qualitative
<BR>
trait
<BR>
differences (ability to see color, for instance) but I would argue that
<BR>
macroevolution is predominately about quantitative differences.
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;He argues that irreducible complexity can't arise naturally, totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ignoring the many examples we have of this occurring *naturally* on
</EM><BR>
various
<BR>
<EM>&gt; biological levels--molecular, tissue, organelle.&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I recognize that you do not want to be involved in Behe, but I think this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statement is the first one I have seen that bears upon his major point. Do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you have some examples of such naturally occurring complex changes? IIRC,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most of the other comments about Behe had nothing to do with this concept.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, this isn't the first time I've made this point. For instance, I
<BR>
believe I gave a &quot;tissue&quot; example and an &quot;organelle&quot; example in the essay.
<BR>
Time permitting, I will be happy to provide a few examples at the molecular
<BR>
level if you wish (I'll probably talk about LuxR/LuxI since that's a really
<BR>
simple example).
<BR>
<P>But, just to sketch out the answer in advance, irreducible complexity
<BR>
appears to arise quite commonly as a result of selection operating to reduce
<BR>
redundancy that arises in molecular pathways. And redundant systems
<BR>
apparently arise via well known mechanisms such as recombination, or gene
<BR>
duplication.
<BR>
<P>[You will notice the words &quot;appears&quot; and &quot;apparently.&quot; The answer to these
<BR>
sorts of questions requires some sort of phylogeny reconstruction, so
<BR>
inferrence is involved.]
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Carl: &lt;&lt;Macroevolution deals in changes in tooth enamel, and by inference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the type of hair the specimen grows and many other characters. In order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a TE to result in a change in tooth enamel, it must be accompanied by&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific changes in the DNA. Thus multiple DNA changes are required to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a movement of some DNA into a useable form for speciation. If these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Brian:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;So many things were confounded here, I just didn't know what to say.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instance: 1) You seem to have brought macroevolution into the discussion;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why, I have no idea since we were talking about TEs as a source of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quantitative variation. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Macroevolution deals in changes to higher taxa. Paleontologists look at
</EM><BR>
<P>Given the confusion we've experienced so far, I think I need to pick this
<BR>
one nit. Please allow me to reword for clarity's sake. Macroevolution
<BR>
deals in changes *between* distantly related taxa.
<BR>
<P>[You have to be careful with your wording here because one might assume you
<BR>
mean that there are certain changes that occur which cause or are
<BR>
characteristic of macroevolution. This would be a presumption beyond the
<BR>
scope of the definition.
<BR>
<P>Macroevolution is simple a gestalt of all the differences between two taxa
<BR>
that are related beyond the genus level. Some of these differences may be
<BR>
recent in origin, and all of them may be (individually) small.]
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;2) TEs do not have to be accompanied by other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific changes in DNA to have a phenotypic effect. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now I am confused. In our recent discussion, I understood that TEs often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just made the changes necessary for their own survival, and that if it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disrupted some working DNA of the host, it would almost always be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detrimental. Are there positive phenotype effects that lead to heritable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes in the host?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, I promised to come back to this subject above, so here it is. Key
<BR>
point: an effect that is detrimental to a *gene* isn't necessarily
<BR>
detrimental to a *trait*. Let's say, for instance, that the environment has
<BR>
changed such that the food supply is more abundant thereby favoring larger
<BR>
individuals. Now if one individual in our hypothetical population
<BR>
experiences a mutation inside of a gene which normally suppresses growth
<BR>
hormone early in development, that gene may not be so effective anymore. As
<BR>
a result, the organism would grow to a larger size. Bad for the gene, good
<BR>
for the individual.
<BR>
<P>Can you see why it is important to consider the difference between
<BR>
regulatory and structural genes? It's tough to imagine a mutation in a
<BR>
structural gene having anything other than a devastating effect. As such,
<BR>
structural genes don't vary much at all, even between genera. For instance,
<BR>
mutate fibrin or tubulin and you get soup. (See how well intracellular
<BR>
transport operates, or muscles contract, or cells hold together.)
<BR>
<P>But regulatory genes are a different beast altogether. Mutate a regulatory
<BR>
gene and you change the timing, location, or rate of structural gene
<BR>
expression. This isn't inherently bad. Organisms can live with some pretty
<BR>
profound changes in regulation. The double-wing on the dragonfly for
<BR>
instance is a nice example of what happens when you fiddle with a regulatory
<BR>
gene. Ever see a two headed snake or a calf? These also are examples of
<BR>
very extreme regulatory changes. Granted, there are better examples for
<BR>
demonstrating positive fitness effects, but this should give you some
<BR>
anecdotal concept of what an organism can tolerate and survive. Different
<BR>
number of vertebrae? Can do. Larger or smaller jaw? No problem. More
<BR>
teeth? You bet. And because these regulatory genes are arranged in
<BR>
cascades, there are some with global effects, and others with local effects.
<BR>
Anyway, the distribution of mutational effects is impressive.
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;Looking at phenotypes over a macroevolutionly timescale, we do see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multiple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes, but these can almost invariable be explained as accumulated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I suppose they could. Do we find such piecemeal changes in the fossil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; record, or is the explanation supposition?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not a paleontologist so I can't really answer this authoritatively. My
<BR>
impression is that, invariably, one of two situations occurs. Either a) the
<BR>
fossil record is dense, in which case accumulated changes are demonstrable
<BR>
or b) there isn't enough evidence to judge and you end up with some large
<BR>
time line with no way of ordering mutants.
