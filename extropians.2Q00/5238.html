<EM>&gt; Last night I watched a chilling BBC program by a journo who infiltrated a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bunch of soccer thugs in Britain and furtively filmed their antics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boasts. These were not stupid men, by and large. Some of them had (or once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had) reasonably demanding jobs. They just lerrrrved smacking and bashing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the shit out of other people. Their blood was up, it boiled with rage and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; delight, they had flow and peak experience. There's going to be a lot of it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going around, even if Banks's Culture emerges.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And please don't tell me this won't happen if everyone's packing heat (as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they used to say on the mean streets)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Ummm...I *do* spend a lot of time in places where most everyone &quot;packs
<BR>
heat&quot; (and where the local populations consume more than their fair
<BR>
share of alcohol I might add).  The blood does not run in the streets and
<BR>
people are generally very polite in their behavior.  These people
<BR>
are *very* aware of the weapon they carry and the responsibility that goes
<BR>
with it.  As is often noted, the American &quot;wild west&quot; had a lower incident
<BR>
of violent crime than the not-so-wild west ever had.
<BR>
<P>Your claim is frequently made, but has proven to be invalid in the
<BR>
numerous cases where everyone does in fact &quot;pack heat&quot;.  I don't
<BR>
understand how this assertion can be made any more, given the large body of
<BR>
evidence that refutes it.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps populations that &quot;pack heat&quot; have more evolved level of maturity,
<BR>
or at least personal responsibility, than those that don't.  One thing is
<BR>
for certain: broadly armed populations definitely select for these traits.
