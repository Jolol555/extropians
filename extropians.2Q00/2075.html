<EM>&gt; As a brief point (maybe I'm jumping ahead of Michael here), it's

<EM>&gt; probably not quite correct to say Corel's is generation #1, being built

<EM>&gt; derived from Debian.
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite so. I expect any improvements Corel developed will quickly find their way
<BR>
into the gestalt of other distros and that Corels will improve much quicker than
<BR>
their other product lines as well. I'd say that compared to a gen1 product like
<BR>
the alpha release of Win95, there is some comparable ease of install and use
<BR>
issues, for sure, but with the current level of maturity (and considering that
<BR>
linux has many tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people
<BR>
working on improving it, MS has never had more than a few thousand people
<BR>
working on windows upgrades at any given time, so logically, Linux should be the
<BR>
more mature, stable, easy to use, easy to install OS by now. It isn't. Why is
<BR>
that?
