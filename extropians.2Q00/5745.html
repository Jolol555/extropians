Do we need to qualify our choice of  with a number of variables ?
<BR>
<P>how's this for a start...
<BR>
<P>close enough to a trauma center
<BR>
close enough to a cryonics facility
<BR>
a legal venue providing for obtainable life extending services and 
<BR>
substances
<BR>
<P><P>low ambient radiation (radon, ultraviolet, etc.)
<BR>
practical commuting distance to sustain an adequate income (if that is 
<BR>
necessary for how one creates wealth)
<BR>
<P>Location provides efficient means to access new life extending information 
<BR>
(i.e. internet)
<BR>
<P>anything else ?
<BR>
<P>--------------------------------------
<BR>
<P><P><P>This all brings up the question... if you want to survive the longest,
<BR>
all else being equal, where do you choose to live in the year 2000?

<EM> &gt; &gt; According to my math, this is:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; 381 / 82.087.361 =  4,6414E-06 = 0,00046%
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; 12.448 / 272.639.608 =  4,56573E-05 = 0,00457%
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; This is roughly ten times the number of murders per population. I 
</EM><BR>
apologize
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; for not including this figure. But it should be obvious that there is a 
</EM><BR>
huge
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; difference between the kills/population ratio here and in the US. The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; logical question now would be why we have this difference.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; The number of murders in the US is from 1998 because the FBI did not 
</EM><BR>
publish
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; the final report for 1999 on the Internet up to now.

<EM> &gt; I would be curious to see these numbers as a function of population
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; density and perhaps controlling for SES. My hypothesis would be that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; areas with a high population density have the highest murder rate. A
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; corollary to that would be, highly dense areas with low SES (but
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; probably not starvation level) have the highest rate of murder with a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; gun being the weapon of choice most likely irrespective of that areas
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; gun laws.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I'm sure there has been some studies done looking at these factors.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Mike, you have anything handy?
