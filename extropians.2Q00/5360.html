<P><EM>&gt; I know that has played a big part of it for me.  When my kids were born, I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  knew I didn't want them raised in front of the TV like I was; so I 
</EM><BR>
cancelled 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  the cable TV subscription.  It has been about 4 years since we were able 
</EM><BR>
to 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  get network TV in my house and I have found that this has had substantial 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  benefits:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (Fortunately) the only channel that our set can clearly pick up is PBS.  
</EM><BR>
If 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  there is a channel that I *do* want my kids to watch its PBS.  Not having 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  been raised on typical Saturday morning TV, they don't miss it.  In fact 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  they actually *enjoy* watching PBS, but (naturally) not enough to veg out 
</EM><BR>
in 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  front of it all day.  Not being subject to continual commercial ads, they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  don't fall for every toy, fad, whatever marketed to kids by TV advertisers.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know that Bad TV can have a Bad Effect on kids, but I wonder about how this 
<BR>
works.  I know I watched a lot of standard network TV when I was a kid (cable 
<BR>
didn't exist yet).  I really don't think TV was any better then than now.  
<BR>
&quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; certainly 
<BR>
weren't Masterpiece Theater.  And Saturday morning cartoons were laced with 
<BR>
potent kid-oriented advertisements, to which I know I wasn't immune (I HAD to 
<BR>
have G.I. Joe and Mat Mason toys).
<BR>
<P>My mother, especially, did orient us to the GOOD TV that was available.  I 
<BR>
well recall as some of my fondest childhood memories sitting with her and my 
<BR>
brother and my father watching each new Jaques Cousteau special as they were 
<BR>
aired (it helped that Rod Serling was the narrator - surely the coolest guy 
<BR>
on TV when I was a very young kid).  Mom would translate the chatter of the 
<BR>
crew of the Calypso and blush when the producers didn't edit out some of the 
<BR>
kind of talk one naturally hears among deckhands because they figured 
<BR>
Americans wouldn't be able to understand the French.
<BR>
<P>Fond childhood memories aside, I naturally came to find television less 
<BR>
interesting than the stimulation I could find in books and people.  No one 
<BR>
told me to do this explicitly, I'm sure.  Why?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  This has ended up saving us tons of money.  First the cable bill (~$40/mo. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  for programming that I hardly enjoyed anyway).  I have also found that 
</EM><BR>
being 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  out of the loop in terms of current cultural trends has saved me bucks 
</EM><BR>
too.  
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  [snip] 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Suffice it to say that, even if they gave it away for free, I'd never get 
</EM><BR>
my 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  cable TV hooked back up.  Plus, I spent the money I'd otherwise be 
</EM><BR>
spending 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  on TV on a high-bandwidth net connection, which I also find more useful 
</EM><BR>
and 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  enjoyable than I ever found TV to be.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is some price you pay for this choice.  I don't think I lose much by 
<BR>
not watching network TV, but we watch a LOT of movies on cable.  Although 
<BR>
there are a lot of truly terrible films made, there are also many, many very 
<BR>
worthwhile ones.  Film has been the hallmark art form of our age to date.  It 
<BR>
acts as a powerful lens through which some of the brightest minds of our time 
<BR>
have expressed themselves.
<BR>
<P>Oh - and fashion can be fun, too, you know.  It's nice to get dressed up and 
<BR>
put on a show every once in a while.  We are monkey-men, after all, and 
<BR>
display and pageantry are also important means of expression.  Those great 
<BR>
Texas philosophers, ZZ Top, were on to something, I think.
