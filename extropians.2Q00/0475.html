<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; I think monopolization is a problem and that intervention is in some

<EM>&gt; that this is not the case, but simply asserting there exist unnamed

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;No, it doesn't. If Microsoft made all the most useful APIs in their OS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;secret it would help their applications division, but at the expense of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;crippling their OS's ability to compete. Remember, anything Microsoft can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;implement, other OS vendors can also build. If those secret features are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;actually important, a competitor can make a mint by building public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;implementations of them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This would be true if there were competition. There isn't.
</EM><BR>
<P>Prove it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Microsoft does not own the hardware companies, and it does not have a magic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;wand that controls the industry. If hardware vendors pre-install MS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;software, they do so because they thing their customers want them to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This would be true if vendors had some credible alternative to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shipping Windows. They don't.
</EM><BR>
<P>This sort of blank statement, without supporting evidence, is the same
<BR>
sort of BS that the Justice department is engaged in. Totally ignoring
<BR>
the precedence of Apple and its MacOS (which has been shown was crippled
<BR>
by erroneously applied monopolistic overpricing by Apple being undercut
<BR>
by the PC market and Windows in particular). Its interesting that the
<BR>
markets that Apple has a virtual lock on: publishing, for example, are
<BR>
not and will not be under scrutiny so long as Apple keeps Feinstein et
<BR>
al bought off.
<BR>
<P>Beyond Apple, linux, for example, is finally reaching the desktop as a
<BR>
usable consumer product. The Corel Linux release, along with corel ports
<BR>
of PhotoPaint, Draw, WordPerfect Office, and soon, Ventura, make the
<BR>
linux platform a true consumer product. 
<BR>
<P>The only way that Justice can get away with claiming that Windows has a
<BR>
'monopoly' is that they define the market not as 'desktop computer and
<BR>
small network GUI operating systems', but as 'intel-compatible operating
<BR>
systems', which immediately disregards the Apple market share, as well
<BR>
as the BeOS and unix/linux presence in the RISC market. The way justice
<BR>
defined the market is the first disengenuous thing they did, and which
<BR>
is the most important thing they did. Microsoft agreeing to this supply
<BR>
side defined market definition was their first and biggest mistake.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;No, it isn't. A large company can not gain a competitive advantage against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;smaller rivals by selling its product below cost. Why? Because the bigger it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is, the faster it looses money by dumping.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not true. The incremental cost of software is zero.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the incremental cost of software is zero, then there is no such thing
<BR>
as dumping, unless you pay consumers to use your product... ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The problem is that an OS that doesn't run a customer's software is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;worthless. Most customers care a lot more about their apps than they do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about their OS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly. Since the software most people want to run is only available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on Windows any other OS is worthless - regardless of it's other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merits or technical superiority to Windows.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have yet to prove this point. Most major apps are proted to or
<BR>
usable on multiple OS's. It has been SOP that microsoft write Mac
<BR>
versions of its software applications concurrently with their windows
<BR>
versions. Adobe writes its publishing applications for both Mac and PC,
<BR>
and in the end, anyone who feels stuck with a windows only application
<BR>
can go and run this application on OS/2, which it is perfectly capable
<BR>
of running on, and in many cases, runs better on OS/2 than on Windows.
<BR>
<P>All IBM and Lotus software can run just fine on both Windows and OS/2.
<BR>
The very presence of a viable operating system (OS/2), made by a larger
<BR>
and more powerful company, that could run all Windows applications, but
<BR>
was beaten at the marketplace based on price shows that the claims of
<BR>
'manipulation', or 'anti-competetive tactics' are totally bogus.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Programming languages are another example. Because C is a public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; standard, I can choose compliers based on quality and appropriateness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; to a particular task. The same can't be said for Visual Basic, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm lucky if my code is even portable across versions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There is an inevitable trade-off between backwards compatibility and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;innovation. If you value stability, write C code on Unix. If you value rapid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;improvement, use VB or another 4GL on Windows (or wait for MS's new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Intentional language, but that's another story).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This reminds me. I forgot to mention vaporware as another monopolist's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tool. But I'm not talking about backward compatibility - I'm talking about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public standards. These are distinct.
</EM><BR>
<P>Vaporware, as a tool of marketing, merely is a method of providing
<BR>
information to customers to allow them to rationally plan software
<BR>
outlays in the future, rather than thinking &quot;I've got to get this right
<BR>
now&quot;. It helps discourage impule buying, and it is entirely based on the
<BR>
consumers trust and concept of value in the company offering the
<BR>
vaporware.
<BR>
<P>Companies that abuse the idea of vaporware for anti-competetive purposes
<BR>
lose the trust of the market, when the information conveyed is
<BR>
fraudulent (i.e. a supposed release date of 1st Q 1994 turns into 4th
<BR>
quarter of 1995..).
<BR>
<P>However, if competitors don't take advantage of vaporware claims by the
<BR>
opposition, which is possible, then its their own loss.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;But we don't have to agree. I'm perfectly willing to let people like you go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;one using whatever OS and programming technology you prefer. I just want you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to extend the same courtesy to people like me. Just let everyone take the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;approach they prefer, and let the market decide which one works best.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure. Do what you want. I don't want to restrict your choice, I want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to give you more options. Wouldn't you like to choose between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different Windows or VB implementations?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd love to be able to operate in the publishing business without being
<BR>
tied to the Mac/Adobe monopoly. Maybe justice can look into this for
<BR>
me...
