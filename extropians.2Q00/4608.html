<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, I think what Jesus had in mind when he said it, was running the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; camel through a blender, one peice of flesh at a time, pulverizing it's

<P>You are merely assuming.  He didnt actually *say* anything about putting
<BR>
it back together on the other side, so the camel-o-matic blender
<BR>
idea would work.  What he *did* say was it was easier for a camel
<BR>
to pass thru the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven.
<BR>
In this I agree: in fact I was on a team to study this exact problem,
<BR>
taking rich people to heaven using retired ICBMs [the plowshares
<BR>
project.]
<BR>
<P>You figure, typical rich dude, 75 kg, assorted life support, another 300 kg,
<BR>
reentry systems [Doug could back me up] but you will be a good 20,000 kg
<BR>
on the pad, probably couldnt do it for much less than 10 million bucks, and
<BR>
thats assuming a short stay in orbit and that he isnt *too* anal about
<BR>
where he lands.  I would think the camel thing would be easier.
<BR>
<P>Now of course, the other has been done.  I dont suspect John Glenn
<BR>
was too hard up last time he went to heaven.  spike
