Honda alone has spent $100 m. to develop its humanoid series so I think
<BR>
Japan is poised to put automobile-priced humanoid robots on the mass
<BR>
market. How do you think this will change human society when we are
<BR>
interacting on a daily basis with a class of humanoid mechanical slaves?
<BR>
It is going to happen soon.

<P>The above is a well-appreciated reply from another list which I moderate.
<BR>
A Vancouver television group is interested in doing an educational tv
<BR>
program on the &quot;robotics state of the art&quot; given the best of current
<BR>
knowledge and no budget limitations. Jose's answer is the intelligent
<BR>
answer I would expect if I asked most robotics/AI/computing experts
<BR>
for their opinion on this matter (Jose is in that group of experts).
<BR>
And that is why our ed tv program will NOT ask the experts for that
<BR>
opinion. The accummulated FACTS of the program will give the answer.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something is very askew re opinions regarding consumer robotics. In
<BR>
his 1980 book, &quot;Robotics in Practice&quot;, Joe Engelberger, one of the
<BR>
founding fathers of modern industrial robotics said that &quot;...a household
<BR>
robot may be practicable before the end of the 1980's decade.&quot; Others
<BR>
opined that the 1980's would be the era of the personal robot. In his 1990
<BR>
text, robotics professor Spiteri wrote that he expected the 1990's to be
<BR>
the era of the personal robot. &quot;Robotics technology is likely to become
<BR>
the high technology field of the 90's much as the pc has been in the
<BR>
80's.&quot; What happened to consumer robotics given these high expectations?
<BR>
Joe Engelberger is still looking for $5 m. R&amp;D for that household robot.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let's study &quot;robot conversation&quot; more closely and ask the experts
<BR>
who can give us the facts about the very best which could be done
<BR>
now. Don't the experts in psychology, linguistics, law etc. know the rules
<BR>
of conversation? If not, can they give us exerpts from conversation for
<BR>
which the rules are not known? (coding those exerpts would be taken up as
<BR>
great challenge by scientists). It looks to me like it would be a huge
<BR>
undertaking to write out all the rules of ordinary conversation but it can
<BR>
be done...now. What would IBM for example say as to the number of
<BR>
worker-years of labour to do so? Next, how many worker-years would it take
<BR>
to write the code? And finally, what kind of computer would run the
<BR>
program? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This illustrates what I mean by the robotics &quot;state of the art&quot; given
<BR>
current knowledge and no budgetary restrictions. Would anybody like to
<BR>
apply that kind of analysis to any other specific area of robotics?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then return to consumer robotics. I have no doubt that there is a huge
<BR>
&quot;technological lag&quot; between what could be put on the market now and what
<BR>
is on the market now. I have some ideas as to why the lag exists. But the
<BR>
script I am writing for the ed tv program requires that specialists speak
<BR>
for themselves. For example what do the specialists who spend much of
<BR>
their lifetime careers working on a robotic hand say the best performance
<BR>
of such a hand is?  When Professor Moravec writes under his picture of P2,
<BR>
the Honda Humanoid: &quot;The machine has fully functional arms and camera
<BR>
eyes....&quot; what does he mean? &quot;Fully functional&quot; to a humanoid is not the
<BR>
same as fully functional to a human.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to the question of what machine arms, hands and eyes can
<BR>
do, Discovery Channel this week carried an exerpt on the robotic milking
<BR>
machines which are now used in half of the dairies of Europe. The machine
<BR>
slides under the cow and an arm reaches out to attach the milkers to the
<BR>
teats. Now that's something I'll bet even handy/crafty Martha Stewart
<BR>
can't do. So I have to ask: If this nonanthropomorphic machine can do such
<BR>
a thing, is there any reason a humanoid robot could not be designed to do
<BR>
it as well? Further to that, if the robot can find a cow's teat and
<BR>
position a suction cup on it, can it not find a carrot in the Martha
<BR>
Stewart Kitchen and peel it? Could it make complete meals as well as 
<BR>
Martha?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else could the &quot;Martha Stewart Robot&quot; do around the house? Let's
<BR>
go through a detailed list of all those everyday chores and ask what the
<BR>
robotics specialists could come up with to build the necessary features
<BR>
into the robot. What do the experts in machine vision say about what a
<BR>
robot can and cannot recognize in the house by way of &quot;object
<BR>
recognition&quot;? We know this robot can be given more facial-emotional
<BR>
expressions than Martha exhibits now on her show. And there is no doubt it
<BR>
could tell better jokes and even do a little dance for us. Given all these
<BR>
signs of liveliness, some people may even wonder if the robot's
<BR>
'artificial life' should not be accorded some rights just as a natural
<BR>
human life is accorded rights....
