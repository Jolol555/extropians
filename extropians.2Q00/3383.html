<P>
Matt Gingell misunderstood:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A child touches a hot stove once or twice before figuring out it's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad idea. He doesn't stand in front of it for years, trying out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousands of random strategies, standing on his head, talking to it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; holding his breath, till he finds one that doesn't hurt. Learning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't blind search - you're misunderstanding my position if you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's what I'm advocating. Learning both aquires and utilise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowledge and representation, improvement is deliberate and heuristic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure you need a million years if you want to evolve something from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scratch by random variation with some simple operational fitness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; function, and you'll be running till the sun goes out doing an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exhaustive analysis of the space of all possible programs, but those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two possibilities don't exhaust the space of workable learning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; algorithms.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're right, they don't spend years figuring out stoves.  That's
<BR>
because they already have lots and lots and LOTS of information about
<BR>
the world around them before they ever get out of the womb.  This
<BR>
information is stored in the genes and is visible as what we call
<BR>
&quot;instinctual&quot; behavior.  THIS information took millions and millions
<BR>
of years to develop, and without it, our children WOULD be spending
<BR>
years (actually, years is an optimistic estimate, IMO) figuring out a
<BR>
hot stove.
<BR>
<P>Experiments with babies show that babies as early as a few months are
<BR>
surprised to see objects vanish into thin air, come to a full stop
<BR>
without being in contact with another object, and begin moving without
<BR>
a force to propel them.  Babies have a very compicated idea of what
<BR>
elements in their visual field constitute objects and how those
<BR>
objects will generally behave.  
<BR>
<P>This information is not learned from a blank slate at birth.  (There
<BR>
was no time.)  We are born with it.  Unless we program it into our AI,
<BR>
we should expect the AI to require evolutionary time in order to
<BR>
figure these things out.  That's time we don't have.
