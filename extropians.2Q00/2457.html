<EM>&gt;  &gt; without asking the PC owner first.  Only Microsoft thinks is a good

<EM>&gt;  &gt; &quot;feature.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft has an ancient well-documented tradition of releasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unstable, insecure, (ILOVEYOU is just a recent instance, see BUGTRAQ
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; archive for a truly impressive accomplishment track) poorely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineered poorly performing products with proprietary extensions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standards (standards are sure wonderful, everybody should have one),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; notoriously excessive hardware requirements, extremely poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scalability and portability, paired with a remarkable lack of features
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with at best mediocre high latency support, which is frequently so bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's not there. They don't understand version control and proper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software upgrading. They don't believe in strict separation in kernel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and userland, and minimization of kernel code. They don't release
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their source nor development tools with full source, so users can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help themselves and other users. I wouldn't be surprised if their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OSses and apps would have back doors, fed-mandated, and others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In short, they suck on all fronts as far as I can see. According to
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>I've seen so much of this over the years I've grown very weary of it.
<BR>
<P>If you think they suck on all fronts you can see, you can't see the
<BR>
factors that go into making successful office productivity products.
<BR>
Not that you necessarily should see those, but they are real, and
<BR>
Microsoft knows them like nobody's business.
<BR>
<P>I am a programmer.  I've worked mostly with Sun's unices (SunOS and
<BR>
Solaris) as well as a little with AIX.  At home I run NetBSD, and
<BR>
Linux. And I frequently use Windows 98 because I want to see things as
<BR>
my end users will.  I know the difference in quality between the
<BR>
Microsoft products and others I use.  And I have come to think the
<BR>
arguments I read on this topic are like this:
<BR>
<P>Person #1: McDonald's makes the best food in the world. The worldwide
<BR>
popularity of the Big Mac proves it to be an extremely useful,
<BR>
flexible meal product.  It contains all kinds of different food,
<BR>
including vegetable grain and meat.  The price is right.  The
<BR>
consistent high quality is shown by the extremely low number of
<BR>
customers who die immediately after eating a Big Mac.  No one should
<BR>
eat anything but McDonald's food, and in the future, when they
<BR>
introduce their McDonald's Vegan meal, the last objections to everyone
<BR>
eating at McDonald's all the time will be swept away.
<BR>
<P>Person #2: Yuck!  Puke!  I only eat at Antoinette's house of Vegan
<BR>
Delights.  Antoinette is my friend and she's told me exactly what goes
<BR>
into each meal.  The nutritional benefits, the cleanilness of her
<BR>
kitchen, and the quality of her food are way above McDonald's.  Her
<BR>
recipes are better.  She even lets me kibbitz a little and help her
<BR>
improve the recipes.  Talk about having it my way!  McDonald's makes
<BR>
pure poison and eating there is suicide.  No one should ever do it, no
<BR>
one has any reason to do it, and the McDonald's fortune is entirely
<BR>
due to mistakes and stupidity.
<BR>
<P>etc. 
<BR>
<P>These people are arguing totally different metrics of success.
<BR>
There's no point in comparing the two.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
James Wetterau
