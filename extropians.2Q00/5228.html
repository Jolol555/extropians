<P>
Karl Marx claimed that communism was a scientific theory. As such, it must
<BR>
be testable, right? If communism in practice during the 20th century is
<BR>
considered as a series of experiments with known results and consequences,
<BR>
it has been a catastrophic failure. It has not delivered the propserity,
<BR>
freedom or transformation of man that it predicted. Therefore,
<BR>
scientifically, Marxism is bunk.
<BR>
<P>Before looking at its direct results, let's consider the side effects of
<BR>
implementing communism. According to the French ex-communist scholars who
<BR>
compiled &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; communist governments for political
<BR>
reasons have killed approximately 100 million civilians (i.e.,
<BR>
non-combatants in any war or revolutionary conflict). For comparison, please
<BR>
note that this is 4 times the number of civilians killed by the Nazis. More
<BR>
difficult to quantify are the lives ruined and human potential wasted by
<BR>
communist governments. However, based on anecdotal reports of those who have
<BR>
lived under communist governments, it would be fair to state that writers,
<BR>
artists, philosophers, and would-be entrepreneurs were not given the chance
<BR>
to succeed on their own terms. Their less-than-maximum contributions to
<BR>
their respective societies cannot easily be tabulated, but surely represent
<BR>
a tremendous loss to those societies and to the human race as a whole.
<BR>
<P>On the positive side, many scientists and engineers did have the opportunity
<BR>
to work up to their potential with some exceptions, including Darwinian
<BR>
biologists who had been suppressed in the Soviet Union during the reign of
<BR>
Lysenkoism (an offshoot of Lamarkism), and engineers who would have
<BR>
preferred to work on non-military projects but who had been assigned to
<BR>
military work without their consent.
<BR>
<P>In terms of the material abundance, there is plenty of proof that communism
<BR>
fails to deliver. The joke in the old Soviet Union was that if communism
<BR>
came to the Sahara Desert there would be a shortage of sand. Recall that
<BR>
Russian coalmine workers went on strike during the final year of the USSR's
<BR>
existence. What was there non-negotiable demand? Soap!  If you've ever seen
<BR>
the blacked faces and hands of men emerging from a coalmine, you know that
<BR>
soap is nearly as important to them as food. If communism promises to give
<BR>
to all according to their needs, how can it deny soap to coalminers?
<BR>
<P>Then there is the whole matter of quality. Communism is the reign of
<BR>
quantity over quality. Factories were required to produce assigned
<BR>
quantities of good, even though the quality of those goods was so low that
<BR>
no one with any other options would buy them. Thus we have the situation of
<BR>
the post-Soviet 1990s when Russian goods (still being made by workers and
<BR>
managers trained under communism) cannot compete on world markets. In fact,
<BR>
the situation is even worse than that. Their manufactured goods are so bad
<BR>
that the world market has priced them below the market value of their raw
<BR>
material inputs. Can you imagine that? The legacy of communist economics is
<BR>
an industrial system that *REMOVES* value from raw materials!
<BR>
<P>But let's give credit to communism where it is due: Under communism, few
<BR>
people starved unless the government wanted them to. Stalin starved farmers
<BR>
in the Ukraine during the 1930s by confiscating their crops. Mao did the
<BR>
same with his cockamamie schemes of the 1950s and 1960s. But for most
<BR>
citizens, there was bread or rice, and a few other vegetables with some
<BR>
occasional meat. And that's pretty much all there was for the next 50 or 60
<BR>
years. So for anyone whose greatest dream is to have a subsistence diet
<BR>
while foregoing freedom of speech, association, religion and economic
<BR>
opportunity, communism offers just the morsels they crave.
<BR>
<P>Given the manifest failures of communism, we must ask why Marxism is still
<BR>
taken seriously by anyone. Certainly there are enough Marxist professors at
<BR>
American universities to make this question pertinent. I believe the answer
<BR>
is memetic: Marxism is a potent meme-complex that fits neatly into the mind
<BR>
space that would otherwise be occupied by other grand meme-complexes such as
<BR>
Catholicism or Transhumanism. Assuming that to be the case, we clearly need
<BR>
to redouble our efforts to introduce Extropian memes to those susceptible
<BR>
young undergraduate minds that otherwise could be swayed by the poisonous
<BR>
dreams of Marx.
<BR>

<BR>
