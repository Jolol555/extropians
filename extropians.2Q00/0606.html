<EM>&gt; Agreed. In addition, if the &quot;have-nots&quot; aren't permitted to join the haves&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you run the risk of envy, which leads to things like looting and burning and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other behavior by the lumpen masses which tends to annoy the elite. History
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has shown that the prols are not happy eating  cake, while he elite dine on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fine beef.- -Zero

<EM>&gt; This also hinges on the power difference between the &quot;haves&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;have-nots.&quot;  I would hope that the access to knowledge and technology will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not be so limited to the public that they are not simply at the mercy of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government and corporate elite.  I would hope that the continued rise in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; influence, wealth and education of the 'middle-classes' will continue and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would seem that this will happen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In 2050, there will still be &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; but the definitions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will have changed.  This has been talked about on the list before,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly.  A 2050 &quot;have-not&quot; may have a lifestyle that only a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multi-millioniare has now, and yet will feel frustrated by living when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking at the &quot;haves&quot; who can afford certain services and luxuries that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they cannot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am curious to know what the list members think will be the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; differences between the &quot;haves and the have-nots&quot; a half-century from now?

<P>This is very good thinking John. I've been saying the same thing, but I
<BR>
am sure that there will be liberals in 2050 decrying how the poor are
<BR>
getting poorer and the rich are getting richer, even though the average
<BR>
poor person has a full and rich diet, lives to an average age of 200,
<BR>
owns a fully immersive virtual reality media system, works from home via
<BR>
mental implants connected to the web. The fact that they can only afford
<BR>
mass transit launches to space and have to wait a few weeks longer than
<BR>
the average person for cloned transplant organs will be seen as
<BR>
scandalous and needing a presidential commission to get to the bottom of
<BR>
why these people are being taken advantage of this way.... It seems to
<BR>
be a perpetual theme among the redistributionists.
