<EM>&gt; You may have heard by now about how the national missile defense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is all a big reaganesque fantasy, etc.  I was just wondering if anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here has any strong opinions in this regard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The local paper, the San Jose Mercury News, decided to cash in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its credibility thus: they ran an article with a column on the front page
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the entiiiiirrrre baaack paaaage, going on and on about how the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concept is flawed, would neeeeever work, how it was all a big boon-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doggle, how 4 out of 5 defense scientists surveyed agreed it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never work, etc.  That was in Wednesday's paper.  The entire back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; page.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In all that verbiage, there was not one word in there, not a single word,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the last two THAAD missile firings, both successful.  I suppose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there was some bizarre line of reasoning that lead to the decision that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact that a feat has already been accomplished is irrelevant to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arguement of whether or not it is possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The saaaammme daaaaay that the huge negative article was running, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defense scientists at Sandia used a ground base laser to destroy an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incoming missile.  Think about that for a minute.  That story was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reported in the Merc, on page 10A, twoooo seeennnntences, one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which was totally irrelevant to the event, having to do with Israelis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vs Lebanese or something.  So.  One sentence.  Vs the back page.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would have let it drop, but today they ran ANOTHER eeyore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; article.  you remember Eeyore, the donkey?  Dismal, droopy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; character, not extropian at all:  &quot;It'll never wooork, oh deeear,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; woooe is meeee...&quot;, whereas Tigger is more my style, bouncing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around on his tail, always having fun and enjoying life: Woo hoo!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wooo hooo!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So I fired off a letter to the editor, scolding him, asking if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had anyone there at that paper who was responsible for *balance*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the Eeyore article, there was no actual news.  All of it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merely political commentary.  When an actual news item happened,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they gave it two sentences.  Was this the Mercury *News*, or was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it the San Jose Mercury Propaganda Sheet?  Could they manage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to mix a little Tigger with the Eeyore?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know some say the National Missile Defense could be made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to work but shouldnt.  I guess we need to wait until a city
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is actually nuked off the face of the earth to start developing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such a thing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What say ye, extropians?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Funny thing was the other night, Gen. Al Haig and an Air Force General
<BR>
were interviewed on the Putin summit and SDI, and when asked directly if
<BR>
lasers have been used to shoot down ballistic missiles, they both pulled
<BR>
the 'can't confirm or deny' act....
<BR>
<P>Scientists for Social Responsibility admitted back in '87, and I quote
<BR>
from one of their directors,&quot;The debate is no longer scientific, its
<BR>
economic.&quot; (See &quot;Mutual Assured Survival&quot;) They have been trying to
<BR>
argue that if the enemy can build its offensive capability for less
<BR>
money that it costs you to build your defensive capability, then you've
<BR>
already lost. They pointedly ignored a) the fact that the economic
<BR>
capaiblities of the offense and the defense might be different, and b)
<BR>
the fact that the cost of the defense is less expensive than the cost of
<BR>
allowing your infrastructure and economy to be destroyed in an attack.
<BR>
<P>I can guarrantee that the dems will wait until someone gets nuked before
<BR>
they pull their heads out of their asses. The only reason Clinton is
<BR>
even supporting this is because the generals are about ready to munity
<BR>
or retire en mass in protest against the way Clinton has emasculated the
<BR>
military across the board while at the same time exhausted it with more
<BR>
deployments in peacetime than under any other president.
