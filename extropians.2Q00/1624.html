<EM>&gt;  Waldemar Ingdahl
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Transhumanism has been very bad at understanding the consequences of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own philosophy, our opponents have been much better at it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  Our opponents have typically argued from religion or something
<BR>
sounding like it, relied upon media catch-phrases and simplistic
<BR>
interpretations of SF film and literature, or ignored all but one or two
<BR>
dramatic possible futures of technological development and application.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since the &quot;old guard&quot; of the ExI left this list it has often degenerated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into quite inconsequencial ramblings. This is because of a lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understanding of our own ideology.
</EM><BR>
<P>I doubt that understanding of whatever ideology there is in particular has
<BR>
much to do with it.  Those prone to inconsequential ramblings will waste
<BR>
bandwidth anyway.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This presents are very bad face to potential investors and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sympathizers. In short: it has become a geek club.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that non- or anti-corporate or -mainstream attitudes are unpopular
<BR>
with corporate and mainstream individuals and organizations.  But the [geek
<BR>
club] of the personal computer and software developers became quite
<BR>
powerful once it was noticed.  Most companies, for example, aren't going to
<BR>
really care and produce funding if you're an earnest transhumanist and have
<BR>
a clever idea for making utility fog chewing gum unless they know that and
<BR>
how they can sell it.  I don't know a lot about the history but it's
<BR>
probably the case that the personal computer hackers got noticed when they
<BR>
started selling machines.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think this is very much up to the members- we have to be better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; informed of our own ideology
</EM><BR>
<P>What does this mean?  Members of the list (or of EI or the general
<BR>
transhumanist movement or whatever) aren't clear on what the list (or EI,
<BR>
et cetera) is supposed to stand for?  And they are thus embarrassing
<BR>
everyone by going in different directions?  Yes, the business and political
<BR>
world likes a nice, simple, unified facade with which people can easily
<BR>
agree or disagree or conduct business.  If individuals are genuinely
<BR>
interested but unaware of the diversity or depth of scientific or social
<BR>
positions then they might want to have a convenient and reliable set of
<BR>
resources which may help them to assess and refine their opinions.  But
<BR>
this process does not require or imply total agreement.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; we need to break down the pyramids of our organisations. Strangly enough,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumanism across the world have become very similar to old clubs. A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few on the top doing all the work, and the rest waiting passively for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; top to do things.
</EM><BR>
<P>To what pyramids are you referring?  What is [all the work] that these
<BR>
organizations are doing?  I don't have a membership to EI or any other
<BR>
organization with a transhumanist focus but I don't see any real
<BR>
restrictions on anyone's activities.  The people [at the top] are there
<BR>
because they put themselves there or because they did something to get
<BR>
there.  In terms of the actual science and technology you are free to
<BR>
submit papers to journals and conferences (though you might, if you don't
<BR>
meet the academic community's requirements for credentials, encounter
<BR>
some resistance there).  If you have political or social statements to
<BR>
make, make them available in the appropriate media.  This (loose)
<BR>
community presumably judges work based on its own merits---you shouldn't
<BR>
have to fight to promote good ideas.
<BR>
<P><P>I agree that this is a difficult topic overall---things are moving fast and
<BR>
the media are already presenting and meddling with it.  Several people on
<BR>
this list, at least, have been for some time fretting about the mainstream
<BR>
public face of the science and technology and what can be done to drive
<BR>
things in the right direction.  I don't have any great answers but right
<BR>
now I do suspect the following, for example.
<BR>
<P>Some important developments may be quite out of the control of whatever
<BR>
loose or focussed agencies are positioned to have some influence.
<BR>
Important work will emerge from the efforts of the population of
<BR>
researchers and engineers.
<BR>
<P>There may not be a single breakthrough which catalyzes or cleanly divides
<BR>
the public.  While certain technologies could do so they may not appear
<BR>
fully-formed and with singularity stamped all over them.  We have to
<BR>
prepare for various possible futures, including those in which we get what
<BR>
we want in relatively small pieces.
<BR>
<P>Direct political influence (say, a dedicated party, as some have proposed
<BR>
here), at least in the U.S., will not happen, at least soon.  The
<BR>
Libertarian Party, for example, is mostly considered rather fringy and it,
<BR>
I assume, haven't even said anything about uploading.
<BR>
<P>There are many cases where funding is clearly lacking; but as I said, the
<BR>
benefactors must consider the work to be in their own interest.  And
<BR>
enthusiasm alone isn't necessarily enough.  Funding has a greater chance of
<BR>
coming when someone has something to fund.
