<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But... perhaps because
<BR>
<EM>&gt; civilization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was a bad idea?  The fossil evidence shows that farmers work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; harder and are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less healthy than hunter-gatherers.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a question I've pondered for some time.  I first began to focus my
<BR>
thinking along these lines when a friend gave me a book called _The
<BR>
Paleolithic Prescription_ in response to my complaint that my sedentary job
<BR>
as an office worker didn't allow me to get enough exercise to run enough
<BR>
food through my gut to get sufficient nutrients to keep my body healthy.
<BR>
<P>_The Paleolithic Prescription_ was mostly a diet book which advocated higher
<BR>
fiber, less refined sugar, etc.  But it also touched on the issue of overall
<BR>
lifestyle, and one of the books cited in the bibliography was a collection
<BR>
of scholarly papers published in book form under the title _Paleopathology
<BR>
at the Dawn of Agriculture_.  I found this book at the university library
<BR>
near where I live.
<BR>
<P>The archaeological evidence presented was fascinating. It told a tale of
<BR>
tall, robust hunter-gatherer (and incipient horticulturist) people with few
<BR>
dental caries and little evidence of disease(and of course there were no
<BR>
epidemic type diseases, since the people didn't live tightly clustered
<BR>
together). These strong, healthy people gave way, as agriculture became the
<BR>
dominate occupation, to miserable wretches with bones bowed by hard labor,
<BR>
rotted teeth, ulcerated bones, and short stature presumably caused by poor
<BR>
diet. The level of health enjoyed by pre-agricultural
<BR>
hunter-gatherer-horticulturists hasn't been again approached until the
<BR>
latter part of the 19th century, and then only by a relatively small elite
<BR>
group.  Which is, of course, what we who read this mailing list are members
<BR>
of.  An elite group.  (I saw something thirty-something years ago that has
<BR>
stayed with me as one of my more vivid memories:  Lizzie and I were driving
<BR>
in the mountains near Mexico DF and got into a traffic jam caused by men
<BR>
working on the road.  As we were sitting there in this traffic jam, an old
<BR>
man walked by, breathing the dust and fumes of the road.  He was bent over
<BR>
by the weight of a large, full sack he carried on his back. I knew the
<BR>
villages of the area: most had no electricity or running water or any of the
<BR>
other modern luxuries. The old man may not have ever ridden in a car.  And
<BR>
yet here he was, breathing the filth of the road, the elite group's offering
<BR>
of an offal too tenuous to even be of use to a scavenger.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;[It's difficult to tell from a few fossil remains how long the average
<BR>
person lived.  I find the life expectancy stats confusing anyhow, because
<BR>
they're often given with no clue as to whether they refer to life expectancy
<BR>
at birth, at the age of five years, at the age of fifty years, or what.
<BR>
Based on my current understanding, which is subject to change at any time, I
<BR>
feel that life expectancy figures are misleading if they're interpreted as
<BR>
the age-at-death range that could be expected by the average person at the
<BR>
age of, say, 30.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From my own observation of people where I live (Texas, USA), I suspect that
</EM><BR>
for the person reaching the age of 50, the life expectancy is probably not
<BR>
very different now from what it was a hundred years ago.]
<BR>
<P>Anyway, back to the question of whether civilization was a mistake.  This is
<BR>
a topic for a book rather than a post to a mailing list, but it I think it's
<BR>
a rather important topic to examine as we sit here poised on brink of
<BR>
asymptotic accerleration towards...some singularity or other.
<BR>
<P>As I've mentioned before on this list, the idea that food production
<BR>
requires hours and hours of backbreaking labor is a myth. Nor does it
<BR>
require vast tracts of land.  There's been much talk on the list of reaching
<BR>
towards a time when all people can be freed from odious labor.  I'll tell
<BR>
you the truth as I see it:  the time is now, if people would only see. I'm
<BR>
not about to advocate going backwards and becoming hunter-gatherers again.
<BR>
(I may be lousy at communicating sometimes, but I'm not stupid) But, as I
<BR>
sometimes say, I'm for elegant tech, whether it be hi or lo.  I'm for what
<BR>
works the best, taking into account the entire context in which the
<BR>
technology is being applied.
<BR>
<P>One of the things that troubles me the most about the Green Party and other
<BR>
such &quot;envornomnetally concerned&quot; groups is that they tend to obscure a very
<BR>
real problem.  We, as a culture, are trashing our home planet.  Even if I
<BR>
knew I could hop on a ship and be outta here to another planet tomorrow I
<BR>
wouldn't want to trash Earth.  But the fact is, there's no assurance that
<BR>
any substantial number of us WILL be able to go elsewhere. The things I read
<BR>
that I find most disturbing are things like the loss of approx. 50% of the
<BR>
species of soil organism in central Europe and sinificant loss of ocean
<BR>
plankton.
<BR>
<P>More on this later. I gotta go. I had intended to spend the past half hour
<BR>
studying C4 plant biology, not writing this message.
