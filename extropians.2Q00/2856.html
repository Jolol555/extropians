The only hope is the universe we know is a debug version with symbols, and 
<BR>
we can connect an equivalent of a serial cable to this remotely, else we 
<BR>
have a retail version, and our only hope is to fdisk.

-----------------------------------
<BR>
<P>&quot;Diplomacy is saying ''nice doggy'' until you find a rock.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Delusions [may] be the only things which render life tolerable, and, as 
<BR>
such, are jealously defended against all the assaults of reason.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Into a soul absolutely free From thoughts and emotion, Even the tiger finds 
<BR>
no room To insert its fierce claws
<BR>
One and the same breeze passes Over the pines on the mountain And the oak 
<BR>
trees in the valley; And why do they give different notes ?
<BR>
No thinking, no reflecting Perfect emptiness; Yet therein something moves, 
<BR>
Following its own course
<BR>
The eye sees it, But no hands can take hold of it The moon in the stream
<BR>
Clouds and mists, They are midair transformations; Above them eternally 
<BR>
shine the sun and the moon
<BR>
Victory is for the one, Even before the combat, Who has no thought of 
<BR>
himself, Abiding in the no-mind-ness of Great Origin&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;In the Warrior's way, one accepts what one is and pulls oneself back from 
<BR>
all those places where one is not. If you want to reach your true power, you 
<BR>
are forced, first, to accept things as they are, second, to live in the 
<BR>
truth of what you are and, third, to control your mind and emotions so that 
<BR>
they do not carry you away into a fantasy which would eventually become an 
<BR>
affirmation of lack.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;All things appear and disappear because of the concurrence of causes and 
<BR>
conditions. Nothing ever exists entirely alone; everything is in relation to 
<BR>
everything else.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Tiefer, tiefer, irgendwo in der Tiefe gibt es ein Licht&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;'Blessed be the man who will overcome for he shall be given the hidden 
<BR>
manna, the white stone of purest kind, up on which will be written a new 
<BR>
name.&quot; [Rev. 2:17]
<BR>
<P>&quot;As nightfall does not come at once, neither does oppression. In both 
<BR>
instances, there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged. 
<BR>
And it is in such twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the 
<BR>
air - however slight - lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness.&quot; - 
<BR>
Justice William O. Douglas
<BR>
<P>&quot;What is in the stars is on the earth.  What is on the earth is in the 
<BR>
stars.&quot; &lt;Lakota Elders&gt;
<BR>
<P>&quot;It is very nearly impossible . . . to become an educated person in a 
<BR>
country so distrustful of the independent mind.&quot;- James Baldwin
