<EM>&gt; Mike, you can't imagine how wildly weird this sort of thing sounds in Oz.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How pathologically dangerous the society must have become to permit a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rational man like yourself to regard such fears as natural and attitudes as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; righteous.
</EM><BR>
<P>Keep in mind Damien, that of the 15,000 people who were killed last year
<BR>
here with guns, most were criminals caught in the act. Killing a
<BR>
predatory animal is nothing more than taking out the trash.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So you buy your wife a gun, fine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is weird too. `You' are as likely to be a woman as a man, if we're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talking adults. And in Australia, wives tend to buy their own stuff.
</EM><BR>
<P>True.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Your kids [...] either weapon, neither of which they can use.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I should bloody well hope not!
</EM><BR>
<P>My older brothers' best friend, who was the son of my grandfathers best
<BR>
freind, (the pediatrician who birthed myself and my brothers), was
<BR>
executed in his parents home at age 14 along with his father and mother
<BR>
by a biker gang in 1978. He was pretty well trained by his father in use
<BR>
of firearms, and the only reason he wasn't able to save himself and his
<BR>
parents that night was because the .45 semiauto he used when the gange
<BR>
broke into the house misfired on the first round. I was 9 at the time.
<BR>
Since then I have become quite proficient in the use of any and all
<BR>
firearms, as are most all members of my family. We have all been taught
<BR>
the safe and responsible use of firearms, about respect for the
<BR>
technology, and respect for the Constitution.
<BR>
<P>This crime occured in Massachusetts, the state that loved to brag that
<BR>
it had the most 'progressive' and 'modern' gun control laws in the
<BR>
country, that these laws 'protected' the citizens of our fair and
<BR>
democratic commonwealth, and that the modern police organizations of the
<BR>
state were there to provide that protection, that people didn't need to
<BR>
defend themselves. This was a year when Massachusetts' crime rate was in
<BR>
the top 5 for the entire country, and ws that way for at least a decade
<BR>
and a half after that time...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An especially worrying aspect of this (dominant?) American mind-set became
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparent to us in Oz a few weeks back, when we learned that the NRA were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TV-broadcasting ads that straight-out lied through their teeth about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allegedly vile consequences of gun buy-back laws here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The claims were that we'd gone to the dogs, people were cowering from an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasing assault by armed crims, blah blah. In fact, official crime data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showed that things had *improved* in all the salient parameters, as one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would expect.
</EM><BR>
<P>Find independent data. The data shows that your violent crime is up. You
<BR>
actually think your government is going to tell you the truth now that
<BR>
it has gotten your guns away from you?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The NRA falsified their statistics in the most blatant fashion. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conservative Aussie govt was so outraged that they threatened to take legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action against the NRA, a step I found astonishing for a right-wing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government. I don't know if news of all this reached the States, or just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the paid lies.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm surprised that commie conspirer- Ted Turner, has not made hay of
<BR>
this in an effort to embarrass the NRA, unless of course the charges of
<BR>
your government and media are likely to disproven. Turner has already
<BR>
been embarrassed himself once with a poorly placed internal memo....
