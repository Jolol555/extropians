<EM>&gt; Sounds a lot like Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, a game that I love but

<EM>&gt; (It is interesting to note that besides his collectivist/fascist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas, Chairman Yang has the best transhumanist quotes in the game -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Provost Zakharov is fun but far too much research for research's own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sake in his quotes to be a real transhumanist)

<P>I think the seven default characters were all designed with positive and
<BR>
negative aspects, to provide something to love or hate depending on
<BR>
whether you usually played as them or against them.  Even more
<BR>
interesting is that most of the positive aspects lead towards
<BR>
transhumanism in one form or another - Deidre through merging with the
<BR>
ecosystem she protects, Yang as you noted, Morgan through engineering
<BR>
all kinds of new abilities, and Zakharov...well, just listen to the
<BR>
Voice of the Planet snippet.  And then there's the
<BR>
both-libertarian-and-beauraucratic Peacekeepers...
<BR>
<P>If I recall correctly, this is not the first time that the nature of a
<BR>
lot of this game's quotes has been cited on this list.  I, myself, have
<BR>
been able to explain some of my dreams as &quot;what they have in this game,
<BR>
only make it available to us in reality,&quot; to those who might not have
<BR>
understood any other way.  I wonder...what might it take, to encourage
<BR>
more popular fiction with these themes, so that those who grow up to
<BR>
emulate the stories they see have choices other than Frankenstein
<BR>
(movies, not the original book) and &quot;anything you don't understand must
<BR>
be evil&quot; modes?
