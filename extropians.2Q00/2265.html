<EM>&gt; One problem here is that it is hard to determine who to target as
</EM><BR>
perpetrator of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; these kinds of erosions of freedom.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For example, in this red-light camera situation, it is obvious that
</EM><BR>
Lockheed
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Martin, privately making money off some kind of law enforcement, is
</EM><BR>
somewhat to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; blame for advancing this violation not only of privacy but of the
</EM><BR>
Consitution
<BR>
<EM>&gt; which states quite bluntly that citizens are innocent by default.
</EM><BR>
<P>How, exactly, is putting up a camera at an intersection a violation of
<BR>
Constitutional rights? The presumption of innocence does not imply that the
<BR>
State can't watch you to see if you do something illegal - if it did, police
<BR>
would not be able to patrol the streets giving out traffic tickets. So long
<BR>
as the normal standards of evidence are observed in court (i.e. they have to
<BR>
show that it was you, not just someone with your license plate number), no
<BR>
rights have been violated.
<BR>
<P>Likewise, there is no general right to privacy in public places. In practice
<BR>
such a 'right' would be both nonsensical and coercive, since it would amount
<BR>
to a demand that no one be able to look at you when you walk down the
<BR>
street.
<BR>
<P>No, I'm afraid that if we want to turn this into a rights issue, we'll have
<BR>
to campaign for a Constitutional amendment forbidding government
<BR>
surveillance.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyways, I say this before, it seems quite obvious, any automated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law-enforcement like a red-light runner camera is a violation of every
</EM><BR>
citizen
<BR>
<EM>&gt; who passes through that intersection's right to presupposed innocence
</EM><BR>
under the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Constitution.
</EM><BR>
<P>In theory there is no legal difference between automated and non-automated
<BR>
law enforcement. If a cop can sit at an intersection and watch for traffic
<BR>
violations (a perfectly reasonable activity), he can put up a camera to do
<BR>
it for him. In practice the automated systems are actually held to a higher
<BR>
standard than human police - if a traffic cop says he saw you break the law
<BR>
the courts will usually take his word for it, but an automated system has to
<BR>
collect enough evidence to convince the court that there is no reasonable
<BR>
possibility of error (usually your picture, a picture of your license plate,
<BR>
and an instrument reading showing your violation, all time stamped and
<BR>
recorded by a tamper-resistant system).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Mr. Brown, you state that you think that it is not easy to require the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government to not monitor its citizens.  Well, its bad enough now and that
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; why we need proactive measures and law to protect the citizenry's explicit
</EM><BR>
right
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to presupposed innocence.  It's in some ways as simple as suing the
</EM><BR>
government
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to prevent them from doing so.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, as I pointed out above, you don't have any grounds to sue
<BR>
them. You might be able to trump up some strained interpretation of an
<BR>
implied right to privacy, or something equally iffy, but that's about it.
<BR>
IMO such lawsuits are inherently harmful no matter what the cause is - if
<BR>
you think we should have a right that isn't clearly recognized by the
<BR>
Constitution, the proper course of action is to work to get an amendment
<BR>
passed.
<BR>
<P>Now, personally, I don't worry too much about this kind of observation. Even
<BR>
if we end up with cameras everywhere, the results are not especially bad.
<BR>
The danger is that they will want to expand the system to cover private
<BR>
property and/or internet activity. However, I think that it not too hard to
<BR>
draw a distinction between public and private spaces, and to forbid
<BR>
government surveillance of the latter.
<BR>
<P>Mind you, we will still have to come to terms with the fact that in 10 years
<BR>
everyone is going to be able to inconspicuously record everything that
<BR>
happens in their presence, whether you want them to or not.
