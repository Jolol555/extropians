A few weeks ago, someone challenged Damien about being signed up for
<BR>
Cryonics.  His reply (included below, since it's been awhile) was that
<BR>
he doubts that current cryonics technology will lead to viable
<BR>
freezings.  I think that misses one of the points about signing up now. 
<BR>
You should buy insurance now so you can afford to get frozen when you're
<BR>
older, insurance would be more expensive, and the technology will be
<BR>
better.  If you don't buy the insurance now, it's much harder to afford
<BR>
later.  If you're already in a position that you can set aside the
<BR>
appropriate amount of money now, you don't have to worry about getting
<BR>
the insurance now.  Signing up now gives a boost to the people working
<BR>
on the technology now.  You wouldn't want them to stop working on it
<BR>
would you?
<BR>
<P>I'm a pessimist about some kinds of development.  I think cryonics will
<BR>
be the only chance of reaching the distant future for too many of us,
<BR>
and I think it'll be useful for at least a few decades before quality
<BR>
stasis and revival equipment can keep an accident victim from having to
<BR>
succumb for a while.  (I leave aside the arguments of those who said
<BR>
they had no personal desire to survive; that didn't seem to be your point.)
<BR>
<P>I'm also making progress on being healthy enough to survive without
<BR>
needing that safety net.   I'm 41, but according to realage.com, I have
<BR>
the life expectancy of a 30-year old!  This site (though it's hard to
<BR>
tell by looking at it) was recommended by Health magazine as basing its
<BR>
recommendations on only the largest controlled, long-term studies.  The
<BR>
book (RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be?) apparently has better
<BR>
references to the studies its based on.

<EM>&gt;BTW, are you already signed up, Damien? ;-)

<P>No. I live in the wrong part of the world (as do most people, of course).
<BR>
And besides, I estimate that there's bugger-all chance of successful
<BR>
revival given current best state of the art. I just hope I can cling on
<BR>
long enough for age-halting and then reversing processes to become
<BR>
affordably available. But my brain is already slowly degrading, I feel it
<BR>
happening year by year as I grow palpably stupider and more forgetful.
