<P>
What if you could reproduce by fission?  Every cell in your brain (and
<BR>
body) splits into two, then they separate, each set of cells maintaining
<BR>
their relative cohesiveness and connectivity even as the cells from the
<BR>
other set slip past them.
<BR>
<P>(Sounds like you'd really need a fourth dimension to do this cleanly.)
<BR>
<P>In the end you would have two individuals, each of whom could have an
<BR>
equal claim to being the original.
<BR>
<P>Is the original dead?  Is one of the two &quot;progeny&quot; the original and one
<BR>
a copy?  Or are both, in some sense, the original?
<BR>
<P>Is the physical impossibility of this (in our three dimensional universe)
<BR>
important in understanding the implications of this thought experiment?
<BR>
I.e., would consciousness be fundamentally different if we lived in a
<BR>
universe where this was physically possible?
