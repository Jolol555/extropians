</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When I visit cities with subways I like to get on and pick stops at random,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;go up &amp; walk around.  I love not having any idea what sort of neighborhood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'll find myself in (there are those who would say this is dangerous, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the only times I've ever been attacked by another human have been times 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I was in &quot;good&quot; neighborhoods--maybe because I let my guard down in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neighborhoods).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
You've been very lucky.  Not that I don't try the same sort of thing when I 
<BR>
have the time, but there have been times when I was definitely in real 
<BR>
physical danger.  (Sometimes I imagine that there really are infinite 
<BR>
parallel universes, and, of that infinity, the only one left in which I have 
<BR>
actually survived all the many times of extreme physical peril is the one 
<BR>
I'm in now.)
<BR>
<P>The last extropy meeting I attended, some years ago, I ran out of gas on the 
<BR>
freeway - there was an intermitent clog in my reserve fuel line - managed to 
<BR>
coast/limp off in a bad area of East L.A., and just made it to a gas station 
<BR>
about a half mile off the freeway in what appeared to be a bombed-out, post 
<BR>
nuclear war neighborhood, with not a person in sight except for the little 
<BR>
crew at the station.  It was late at night, and a whole crew of ghouls had 
<BR>
gathered in the gas station lot.  A Vietnamese-looking old guy ran the 
<BR>
little armored blockhouse where you paid, secure - except perhaps from fire 
<BR>
bombing - behind four inches of bullet proof glass, complete with pock 
<BR>
marks.
<BR>
<P>One of the locals, a filthy black woman who weighed at least 350 pounds 
<BR>
insisted on pumping my gas - for cash, of course.  She had no idea, 
<BR>
naturally, of how to gas a motorcycle.  While I was arguing with her about 
<BR>
that, trying to force her to relinquish my gas hose, because of the delays, 
<BR>
my pump cut off, and it took a major effort to convince the Vietnamese guy 
<BR>
to turn it back on.  He was contemptuous and insulting, asking me if I had 
<BR>
never pumped gas before, and I imagine he got a cut of the action there.
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, some of the other surrounding ghouls managed to steal my second 
<BR>
helmet and some papers off the back of the bike.  I'm sure that this was all 
<BR>
a team effort.  If I were not somewhat physically intimidating, I doubt I 
<BR>
would have gotten out of there at all.
<BR>
<P>I've had other experiences almost as bad, almost always in the low-income 
<BR>
black areas of L.A., where I used to provide computer systems to home 
<BR>
schoolers  and do volunteer tutoring at a black school.  You know that you 
<BR>
are totally on your own there as a white person.
