<P><EM>&gt;There is abundant evidence that it is extremely difficult for a real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;monopoly to exist at all, and that large market share does not imply an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ability to gouge customers.  All of the existing &quot;monopolies&quot; familiar to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;modern Americans were created by government fiat, usually because an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;industry wanted special protections from competition.  The historical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;examples cited by anti-trust proponents are generally inaccurate and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discredited.  All in all, there is no good reason to believe that monopolies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be a major problem if anti-trust laws were abolished.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is argument by anonymous authority. I don't find it persuasive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;That is important, because there is abundant effort that the existence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anti-trust laws imposes major costs on consumers and significantly retards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;innovation.  The actual effect of such laws is to reduce competition, punish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;success, and encourage the formation of inefficient government-mandated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;monopolies that waste vast sums of the consumers' money.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; This is an over simplification. If Microsoft gains a competitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; advantage from control of the Windows platform, rather than because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; they're offering a better product, then superior products will fail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; for reason irrelevant to their quality. I would like to see an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; environment where products succeed on their own merits, not because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; their maker controls the distribution channel or a proprietary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; standard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There is no plausible mechanism by which Microsoft could exert such an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alleged advantage.  The fact that they own the OS does not automatically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enable them to build superior programs, and it certainly doesn't let them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;charge more or work more efficiently.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is simply false. Control and access to a proprietary kernel ABI
<BR>
and secret system interfaces confers advantage. The ability to
<BR>
distribute software via pre-install and to control what gets shipped
<BR>
with a PC via exclusionary contracts with hardware vendors confers
<BR>
advantage. The ability to leverage the revenue provided by the
<BR>
'Microsoft Tax' and dump products at below cost confers advantage. The
<BR>
ability to deliberately break competing software via changes to the
<BR>
system confers advantage. Putting aside for a moment the factual
<BR>
matter of whether such strategies were actually used, these are
<BR>
eminently plausible mechanisms.
<BR>
<P>Microsoft dominates the i86 operating system market. Microsoft
<BR>
dominates the Windows office suite market. Microsoft dominates the
<BR>
Windows development tool market. I don't know the break down on web
<BR>
browsers, last time I looked it was somewhere around 50% - though I
<BR>
think it's clear at this point to most observers that Netscape is on
<BR>
the way out. I don't know what the situation for databases and
<BR>
server products either - mail servers, etc. - but they're a significant
<BR>
player in those areas too. I don't think you can seriously believe
<BR>
that they've accomplished this success based solely on the technical
<BR>
merits of their products.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; For instance, I'd like to see a public operating system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; specification - something like Posix - and a law prohibiting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; government agencies from purchasing operating systems that do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; conform to that standard or buying application software which doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; run on some minimalist public reference implementation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So, you want the government to decide what an OS should do and how it should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be implemented, and then pressure application vendors to only write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;applications for the official government OS? Who on Earth could possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefit from that?
</EM><BR>
<P>The Posix standard is an example here - because OS vendors had a
<BR>
mandate to work within a publicly available and publicly influenced
<BR>
standard, today an application written for one *nix is (reasonably)
<BR>
portable to platforms offered by a variety of different
<BR>
implementors. I can choose AIX or Solaris or Linux or whatever because
<BR>
I like it, not because it's the only place I can run Word. As a result
<BR>
there's competition in the Unix market, and I think we've all
<BR>
benefited.
<BR>
<P>Programming languages are another example. Because C is a public
<BR>
standard, I can choose compliers based on quality and appropriateness
<BR>
to a particular task. The same can't be said for Visual Basic, where
<BR>
I'm lucky if my code is even portable across versions. 
<BR>
<P>Now note that I'm talking about a governments being restricted to
<BR>
purchasing implementations of a public standard - not that they make
<BR>
up some random junk and require that everyone observe it. I don't want
<BR>
some bureaucrat throwing darts at a spec anymore than you do. Think
<BR>
about the mandate that DoD projects use the Ada language - this is a
<BR>
reasonable model for the sort of thing I'd like to see.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you could actually do it, you would stifle innovation to an extent no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;monopolist could ever dream of. The government would select OS features on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the basis of political influence, and it would take forever to get anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;new added to the standard.
</EM><BR>
<P>Personally, I'd like to see innovation stifled. I got out of Windows
<BR>
programming because I was sick of working in an industry where
<BR>
interfaces are deprecated before they're documented, and
<BR>
the environment is obsolete before it ever works properly. I don't
<BR>
want more 'technologies.' I want less code that actually works. It
<BR>
should take forever to add anything to the standard - I don't know if
<BR>
you've done much Windows development, but it's like trying to build a
<BR>
skyscraper on quicksand. It doesn't matter how square the corners are,
<BR>
it's still going to sink. I have horror stories if this claim is too
<BR>
abstract.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Vendors could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; than compete and differentiate themselves on the basis of efficiency,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; robustness, etc, of their particular version.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What's wrong with letting vendors competing on the basis of whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;combination of speed, efficiency, reliability and features the customers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consider important?
</EM><BR>
<P>Because with 'features' you get incompatibility, and with
<BR>
incompatibility I wind up buying Windows because I need to run
<BR>
software that won't run anywhere else ---  even if I think it's
<BR>
junk. Software vendors support the most popular platform because it's
<BR>
popular - not because it's any good - and Windows is popular because
<BR>
that's where the software is. It's self sustaining, deliberately
<BR>
maintained by Microsoft, and insidious. Standards break the cycle by
<BR>
making it cost effective to support multiple platforms.
