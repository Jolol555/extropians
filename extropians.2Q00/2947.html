<EM>&gt; One thing to consider - as we move into an era where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these visions *will*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become reality, I think a core principle should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;I can grow you with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *choice* to be better&quot;.  I don't mind playing god, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do mind forcing others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to follow in my path.  The point here is that we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do better than natural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; selection, et al., because we can *choose* our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific mutations/variances.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyway, I don't mean to begin an ethical debate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though I'm sure I will.

<P>What if we ask how we can create dynamic DNA rather
<BR>
than allowing ourselves to fall down the slippery
<BR>
slope of ethical considerations attached with
<BR>
prescribing physical conditions to our progeny? 
<BR>
Without making any appeal to a non-corporeal
<BR>
information existence, I can envision a
<BR>
semi-autonomous process (governed by a deep
<BR>
understanding of genetics) whereby not only are
<BR>
negative factors (e.g. potential disability and
<BR>
disease) precluded within the genetic programming, but
<BR>
only the best (read, &quot;really good&quot;) solutions are
<BR>
found.  All of this however without any hardwiring on
<BR>
the human designers part.  
<BR>
The field currently known as genetic programming uses
<BR>
a highly dynamic matrix of factors which allow it to
<BR>
seek out a near-global optimum in a search space
<BR>
within highly constrained parameters.  The idea behind
<BR>
it (Holland, 1975) was originally derived from
<BR>
biology.  Now that it's been abstracted and perfected,
<BR>
let's use it in biology again.  This time to produce
<BR>
the next generation of people.  You can design better
<BR>
people without definite specifications of what they
<BR>
must be and without falling into the dangerous
<BR>
&quot;eugenics&quot; zone...
