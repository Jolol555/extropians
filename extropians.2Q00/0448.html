<EM>&gt; 2:06 PM,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would argue that the best way to decrease gun abuse would be to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; re-invigorate people's sense of citizenship.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; [....]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would propose that civics courses be moved up to junior and/or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; senior year, and passing with a grade of C+ or higher be mandatory in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; order to register to vote, buy a gun, etc., that the curriculum be set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as a nationwide standard for national citizenship issues, and statewide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to deal with state issues. THis makes the democracy a bit of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; meritocracy, but I don't see that as a bad thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm suprised to hear you propose letting a low-paid, public school teacher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instill the government's version of patriotic values into your kids' heads.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What if your kids don't buy the party line?  Do you really want them to lose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their right to vote or buy guns because their school teacher doesn't like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their political beliefs?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Doesn't this whole plan go against the idea of keeping big government out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people's lives?
</EM><BR>
<P>Teachers are hardly low paid. The median teacher salary for a job that
<BR>
only takes 3/4 of the year (and provides over a month of vacation during
<BR>
the school year), is above $30,000, for an annualized salary of
<BR>
$40,000.00. Not bad at all. The only problem with the plan is letting
<BR>
the NEA get to meddle in the curriculum. I would not accept a plain old
<BR>
teacher for such an important job. Anyone who teaches such a course must
<BR>
have training in constitutional law, be a veteran, etc. Keeping big
<BR>
government out of people's lives can only occur when the people are
<BR>
educated enough to take care of themselves and be responsible citizens.
<BR>
The civics courses in this country have been gutted by the NEA et al
<BR>
over the past 40 years in order to make the population ignorant,
<BR>
pliable, and easy to program with propaganda.
<BR>
<P>Since the Constitution is not a matter of partisan politics (anyone who
<BR>
attempts to subvert it is, in fact, committing treason), then there
<BR>
would be no such thing as 'buting the party line' by the kids. If they
<BR>
want to be enfranchised, they pass the course, just as if they want to
<BR>
drive a car, they pass a course. Don't like it? Why not? You folks are
<BR>
arguing the same thing for carrying a gun. Majority rule has killed more
<BR>
people in the last century than anything else.
