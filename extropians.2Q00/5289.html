Actually, I think the main flaw of communism is that it doesn't recognize
<BR>
human nature. Communism actually works well in tribal cultures based on
<BR>
kinship, and it makes evolutionary sense.  By helping your relatives to
<BR>
survive, you're keeping your genes in the pool.
<BR>
<P>But in agricultural/urban cultures it no longer makes sense.
<BR>
<P>I had a wonderful demonstration of this when I was a kid.  I had a summer
<BR>
job working as a waitress in a coffee shop.  One day someone got the idea
<BR>
that all the waitresses should pool their tips and at the end of the day
<BR>
divide them equally. (this isn't strictly Marxism, since need wasn't taken
<BR>
into account, but it was close enough to demonstrate why communism doesn't
<BR>
work) I don't remember exactly how many waitresses there were, around 8 I
<BR>
think--it was a fairly large coffee shop.
<BR>
<P>I was cute and friendly and fast, so I always got good tips.  It came as no
<BR>
surprise to me that my take was lower than usual when we divided up at the
<BR>
end of the day.
<BR>
<P>What was surprising was that even the waitresses who generally got the
<BR>
lowest tips came out on the short side. Here's what was happening:  instead
<BR>
of trying to take on more tables to get more tips, the tendency under the
<BR>
pooling system was to take fewer tables.  After all, each dollar you lost
<BR>
would only lose you $.125 from the pool, and really it wouldn't even lose
<BR>
you that, since someone else would take the table you decided not to take.
<BR>
And if you moved pretty slowly and got a $.50 tip instead of $1, so what?
<BR>
It would only cost you $.0625 at the end of the day. And so forth.
<BR>
<P>We did the pooling system for two or three days, and then went back to the
<BR>
old way, because everyone was complaining.  I, for one, told the manager I'd
<BR>
quit if we didn't go back to the old way.

<EM>&gt; Yes I have, the closer they approach to capitalism the better off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the people. Most third world problems are related to bad economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas and corrupt government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your missing an essential idea here, communism's central flaw.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Handouts lead to economic apathy (entropy's evil twin) and not just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; among the poor. Read Thomas Stanley's &quot;The Millionare Next Door&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and &quot;The Millionare Mind&quot;. The sons and daughters of wealthy people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who receive &quot;economic outpatient care&quot; (handouts) from their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parents have a lower net worth and earn less than their peers.
