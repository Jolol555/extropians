Hey James,
<BR>
<P>Could you tell me how you calculated the 9%-13% annual return and what
<BR>
adjustments you're referring to?  Where did you get the data?  When I was
<BR>
doing my research, I had a difficult time finding info on stocks that
<BR>
weren't included in indices such as DJ and S&amp;P, even for fairly recent
<BR>
years, much less for a couple of hundred years ago.

<BR>
Brian is correct.  Depending on how you calculate it and the adjustments
<BR>
you take into account, the average return of the stock market is in the
<BR>
9-13% range annually when averaged over decades.  Most people cite figures
<BR>
in the 10-12% range, which Brian did.  These figures go back to when the
<BR>
American stock market was created in this country.  In fact, investment in
<BR>
individual stocks are among the very best long-term instruments in terms
<BR>
of beating negative return factors such as taxes and inflation.
<BR>
<P>The mistake people make is forgetting that this is the average for the
<BR>
entire market.  If you put all your money in one or two stocks (especially
<BR>
ones of dubious value), it obviously will not reflect the market as a
<BR>
whole -- this is why diversification is so strongly recommended by
<BR>
investment advisors.  A properly diversified portfolio (or an index fund
<BR>
if you are lazy) will never fail to yield good annual long-term returns
<BR>
for all practical purposes.  Short of a serious statistical anomaly and
<BR>
poor investment practice, the stock market provides some of the safest and
<BR>
best investment instruments available.
<BR>
<P>In short, a blind monkey with a diversified portfolio can expect an 11%
<BR>
return over the long-term.  A smart person with good investment practices
<BR>
can usually do significantly better and rarely fairs much worse.
<BR>
Unfortunately, there is an uninformed percentage of the investing
<BR>
population that is not content to simply &quot;ride&quot; the market and tries to
<BR>
beat it through pure luck, an unnecessary risk.  These people should have
<BR>
listened to the blind monkey.
