<EM>&gt; The World Health Organisation 2000 Report that came out this week should, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theory, give us some help in choosing the healthiest places. However I found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the summary statistics they gave to need so many qualifiers, ifs and buts,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it became just interesting reading rather that definitive answers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.who.int/whr/">http://www.who.int/whr/</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Overall Health Care top 10..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1 France&gt; 2 Italy&gt; 3 San Marino&gt; 4 Andorra&gt; 5 Malta&gt; 6 Singapore&gt; 7 Spain&gt; 8 Oman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 9 Austria&gt; 10 Japan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The US outspent all other countries at 13.7 per cent of GDP, but was rated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; low because many Americans do not have health insurance. Similarly the US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; average healthy life expectancy was only around 70 (about 4.5 years less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than countries like France, Austria and Japan). This was because there is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; group of up to around 10 per cent of Americans who have such poor health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that their life expectancy drops to around 50 and lowers the overall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; average.
</EM><BR>
<P>So the ranking is a political attack on our system of health care, and
<BR>
not an actual evaluation of the health of people. If they are actually
<BR>
considerin people's actual health, I can see two main reasons for
<BR>
American's ill health that is completely irrespective of our health care
<BR>
system: high calorie corn fed diets and high usage of television. I
<BR>
might also add that demographic breakdowns show that the largest amount
<BR>
of health care deficits occur in our hispanic immigrant population, a
<BR>
commentary supporting my assertions of yesterday on the immigration
<BR>
issue...
