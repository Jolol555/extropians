<EM>&gt; with some [explications by me]

<EM>&gt; ==============
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Aside from a host of  factual errors (including a description of &quot;Mr&quot; Meg
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lees of the Australian Democrats as the leader of &quot;a small but vocal group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of hard leftists&quot;) [she leads a middle-of-the-road but by Oz standards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slightly rightish minority party] more serious misinformation in the pieces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; include the following claims, with correct data provided from Australian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bureau of  Statistics and Australian Institute of Criminology publications:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   The claims incorrectly assume that 1997 is the first year after the new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun laws became operative. In 1996-7 the laws were changed. 1998  is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first year statistics can be tested.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>According to the Australian Institute of Criminology, the new laws were
<BR>
legislated between 3rd quarter of 1996 and April of 1997 in the various
<BR>
states of australia, so while a few states were not in compliance until
<BR>
2nd quarter of 1997, this does not statistically invalidate the whole
<BR>
year. The AIC also states that the only area of firearms related deaths
<BR>
that has seen any statistically relevant decrease is suicides, (from an
<BR>
average around 480 annually down to 331 in 1997). If the mass killing in
<BR>
the once incident at Port Arthur in Tasmania is removed from the
<BR>
statistics for 1996, it would have been an unremarkable year compared to
<BR>
any other, and any 'decrease' that the progunners are claiming are
<BR>
decreases from this abnormal high point in firearms deaths, which is
<BR>
only to be expected due to it being an erroneous event. Outside of
<BR>
suicide, 1997's numbers are almost exactly the same as the numbers for
<BR>
1994.
<BR>
ref: <A HREF="http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi116.html">http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi116.html</A>
<BR>
<P>This illustrates that the Australian gun controllers are exhibiting the
<BR>
same sort of dishonesty as the gun controllers here in the US, where
<BR>
they treat suicide as a crime that has a perpetrator and victim that are
<BR>
different people, and that they are using non-valid datapoints to
<BR>
measure their supposed 'decreases'.
<BR>
<P>Additionally, even counting the Tasmania incident, the 1995-1996 period
<BR>
shows in the study here:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/ti75.pdf">http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/ti75.pdf</A>
<BR>
that the percent of homicides that are firearms related is pretty
<BR>
average, around 21% of all homicides, and it shows that Tasmania
<BR>
specifically tends to exhibit a much higher percentage of firearms
<BR>
homicides than any other state in the Commonwealth.
