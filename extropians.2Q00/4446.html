<BR>
|far as Extropians becomming nazi's; let us eliminate the the mere 'racist' 
<BR>
|jargon; and call a National Socialist a nazi.  If Extropianism is a nazi 
<BR>
|cause, it will soon be found out; if not (as I suspect) then this thread will 
<BR>
|go moribund for a while. 
<BR>
<P>Whether one considers that difference a big one surely depends on whether one
<BR>
subscribe to the etatist philosophy or not.  A &quot;Father beat me almost to death
<BR>
but we are still a family&quot; kind of world view will make the offspring still
<BR>
not abandon the family. I understand that kind of Stockholm syndrome appear
<BR>
in many families where a drunkard beats the wife and kids regularly. That does
<BR>
not make the drunkard less a fascist, of course.
<BR>
<P>A National Socialist equals a Nazi (or a Nazi-Sozi, really).  Many so called
<BR>
``Nazi'' types should really be called ``Nazi wannabes'' or ``neo-Nazis''.
<BR>
Humans typically use the N word as an invective, really. Like the ``idiot''
<BR>
word, which in typical use means ``I don't like you''.
<BR>
<P>So Extropians equals Nazis for people who don't like extropianism for some
<BR>
reason (ideological reasons, most probably).  Extropians would not call them-
<BR>
selves nazis.
<BR>
<P>|But before we do the Turner Diaries Gotterdamerung, (with the Aryans instead 
<BR>
|bunking with the worms) one way to determine Extropianism's emphasis is to 
<BR>
|begin to refer comments back to some of the scholars that inspired this 
<BR>
|philosophy. Lets ask Moravec, and Tipler, and Minsky, and Linde, and 
<BR>
|Nathaniel Brandon and Wheeler and so forth, what they would think of a 
<BR>
|future-life/life extension org becomming Hitlerite? My guess is that this 
<BR>
|would cause some conniption fits amongst any would-be furhers. Maybe their 
<BR>
|next attempt will be some kind of KKK-Amway sales? Doh! I gave em' a 
<BR>
|money-making idea. Shame on me.
<BR>
<P>Maybe.  OTOH the fact that Karl Marx said he was no Marxist did not stop
<BR>
the onslaught of the Communists, did it?
