<EM>&gt; &quot;This&quot; instance of you will NOT step out of the transporter, &quot;That&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instance of you will. You concede that Mr.That is perfectly happy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but you worry about Mr.This, and because he is no longer around you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't ask his opinion of the results. Well, this sort of thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every day. The John Clark of yesterday no longer exists, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember being him so in my opinion he has survived. 
</EM><BR>
<P>This sounds a bit like history being written by the victors, and has
<BR>
similar problems!!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must admit I have no way of asking the John Clark of yesterday if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he is as happy with the results as I am. I just don't worry about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
And I do. Basic Impasse :(.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; Come on, I've been around as some kind of conscious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assemblage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;for a fair number of years, irrespective of what I took into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;lunch yesterday.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly, and the only conclusion to draw from that is atoms are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed. I never meant to imply that particular atoms were! I said
<BR>
(parenthetically) that the majority of atoms will not be replaced
<BR>
instantaneously, but it wasn't the primary point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;There is continuity of experience even as we change, no?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;This is what I trying to say with the space-time line idea.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't see how you could draw a space-time line of a human body,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you'd have to include every particle that had ever been or would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be part of it. It would be like trying to draw one for an ocean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wave.
</EM><BR>
[...]
<BR>
<P>Nice analogy. But you *could* trace some kind of trajectory for the
<BR>
wave in general. Ditto for macroscopic humans.
<BR>
<P>What seems important to you is that the PATTERN is retained; I agree
<BR>
with this. Any decent transporter (or compatible clone :-] ) will do
<BR>
this.
<BR>
<P>But 1.) The PATTERN itself must be transcribed for transmission
<BR>
AFAIK. 
<BR>
Does this change in the medium matter?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.) Saying that two instances of a pattern are indistinguishable 
<BR>
(eg two computer files) is true only in a restricted sense that
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;(a) 2 copies of a computer file may well be structurally and
<BR>
functionally identical (I'm perfectly happy to agree with this),
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;but NOT in the sense
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;(b) That they inhabit the same space or time (our programs are on
<BR>
our respective hard discs.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not your copy is destroyed in the process of uploading
<BR>
to me, there is a change in medium (eg magnetic to optical) during
<BR>
transmission and a change in location. 
<BR>
<P>Beam me up (no, on second thought I'll take the Space Elevator
<BR>
instead),
<BR>
