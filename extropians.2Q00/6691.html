Amara very generously credits me with having helped pursue a line of 
<BR>
Extropian lightbulb jokes--too generously, perhaps, since I do not recall 
<BR>
having penned any of the very funny jokes that she listed.  But I can offer 
<BR>
interested parties a short essay on the importance of humor to Extropian 
<BR>
thought, available at &lt;<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/Silly.html">http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/Silly.html</A>&gt;.  Here's 
<BR>
the start:
<BR>
<P>* * *
<BR>
<P>On the Importance of Silliness
<BR>
<P>Extropianism enjoys a symbiotic relationship with our most vital values, such 
<BR>
as the will to survive and our love of intelligence. Such native meme-sets 
<BR>
run quite deep in humans, and seem likely to play an important role in the 
<BR>
cognition of transhumans to come. That Extropianism cooperates with our most 
<BR>
fundamental goals makes it useful, satisfying, and justifiably popular. We 
<BR>
should thus take Extropianism very seriously.
<BR>
<P>The Threat of Memetic Mutation
<BR>
<P>Memes evolve, however. We should thus also take seriously the threat that 
<BR>
Extropianism could mutate into something that does not promote our 
<BR>
fundamental values. Such a mutation-- call it &quot;Hextropianism&quot;--might slip 
<BR>
past our defenses disguised as Extropianism proper only to attack our 
<BR>
cognitive ecologies. A mildly parasitic form of Hextropianism would merely 
<BR>
feed off of victims. A virulent &quot;Hextropian&quot; cult, however, risks burning 
<BR>
through an ill-prepared population like Ebola through a ward of infants.
<BR>
<P>How can we protect ourselves against dangerous mutations of beneficial memes? 
<BR>
Fortunately, Extropianism already incorporates many safe-guards, such as an 
<BR>
appreciation of reasoned criticism, advocacy of the scientific method, and an 
<BR>
intelligent and skeptical constituency. To stay ahead of competing mutations, 
<BR>
however, we must continue to research additional prophylactics. With that 
<BR>
goal in mind, I suggest that we consider how humor protects against virulent 
<BR>
ideological mutations.
