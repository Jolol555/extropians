<EM>&gt; It may be that these ideas are difficult for people to accept and do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bring to mind the environmental catastrophes in the past.  But I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think we should necessarily tone down our views as a result.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nobody is going to be taking Mercury apart in the next decade.  But 50
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or 100 years from now, it may be possible and desirable.  At that point,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society's social views will probably have changed at least as much as our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own views have changed from those 50 or 100 years ago.  There is no way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to predict whether future society will be radical environmentalists or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;pave the universe&quot; developers by our own standards.  I don't think we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to be that careful to couch our views in a manner which is acceptable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to this month's mores.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually...yes, we do.  It is this month's mores that determine whether
<BR>
the researchers who would bring about the future we desire get funded
<BR>
or have their careers shredded.  It is this month's mores that determine
<BR>
which topics we can speak openly about (and maybe even talk some
<BR>
businesses into selling us the equipment for), and which we have to hide
<BR>
from society's &quot;moral police censors&quot;.
<BR>
<P>You're right in that most of what we want is likely to come about
<BR>
regardless of this.  But I, for one, would like to see it come faster -
<BR>
bring on the Singularity tomorrow rather than a few decades from now.
<BR>
And I suspect I am not alone: the sooner our goals are achieved, the
<BR>
more likely any one of us will live to see it...and if we live to see
<BR>
immortality, we live to see a lot of other things.
<BR>
<P>The average human of 1900 might well be utterly repulsed by what 2000
<BR>
turned out to be, as judged by the standards of 1900, to the point where
<BR>
that person would work to make 2000 more like 1900, quite likely in ways
<BR>
that we as residents of 2000 would find objectionable.
<BR>
<P>Imagine if you were in that situation, except that you had not yet been
<BR>
to 2000; you merely knew what it would be like.  Imagine that you were
<BR>
living in 1900 along with the one who wanted to make 2000 like 1900.
<BR>
How would you convince that person to cease their deleterious efforts,
<BR>
or at least just to not round up a bunch of friends and have your
<BR>
pro-2000 attitudes branded a public menace punishable by death?
<BR>
<P>Add 100 years to both sides, and you won't have to imagine as much...
