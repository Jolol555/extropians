<EM>&gt;&gt;This could be it...possible open sources of *liquid* water.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Woohoo!  Mars, here I come!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Water = Hydrogen and Oxygen.  Fuel to burn, water to drink, oxygen to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;breath.  Most of our supplies are already there.
</EM><BR>
<P>Need Carbon and Nitrogen too, plus minor supplies of Sodium, Potassium, 
<BR>
etc.. There's Carbon there, I am not aware of Nitrogen content.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Could this be why there was so much interest in finding water/ice on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the moon, and now looking for it on Mars?  Was this a deliberate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;search for resources to revive the Space Program?  Is a manned-Mars
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mission the next item on the political agenda?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't doubt at all that NASA is hoping this will enlarge their budget. For 
<BR>
this reason, a very close examination of the evidence needs to be done to 
<BR>
see if it warrants the claims they will make. Don't take their word for it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is this why NASA briefed the White House first?  Will Al Gore promise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to put a person on Mars in this decade?
</EM><BR>
<P>He has stated (at least months ago) that he would not set a date as with the 
<BR>
apollo missions. This could possible change that, but I would not think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Will Republicans fight the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idea?
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't think so. I would guess that there is more democratic support for 
<BR>
NASA then republican, but I don't think of NASA as a democrat/liberal 
<BR>
institution any more then it is a republican/conservative one. NASA was one 
<BR>
of the few things Reagan increased spending on. (former president) Bush was 
<BR>
a supporter of space programs and asked NASA to come up with a manned 
<BR>
mission plan (he changed his mind when he saw the budget). The greatest cuts 
<BR>
in the ISS have come from Clinton.
<BR>
Personally, I'd like to see NASA curl up and die. I would prefer private 
<BR>
enterprise to gain a foothold in space rather then government, even if it 
<BR>
ends up taking longer, because it will end up having stronger roots. I watch 
<BR>
each mission with great interest, particularly the NEAR mission going on 
<BR>
right now and any lunar mission, and I keep a web browser realoading 
<BR>
whenever there is a rendevous between a craft and a body scheduled to occur. 
<BR>
It's always a roll of the dice whether or not it will fail, and it's a 
<BR>
government project so it's very unlikely that it will in any way lead to me 
<BR>
being able to go anytime soon. If the first people on the moon had been 
<BR>
venture capitalists looking for a cheap way to launch communications 
<BR>
satellites, there would be cities there today.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Will this be the next issue for Presidential Politics?
