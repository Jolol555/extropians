<EM>&gt; IMO, this is great, get the EU to take the high ground

<EM>&gt; on human rights and force the U.S. to play catch-up.

<EM>&gt; I would urge those of you in a position to express support

<EM>&gt; for these kinds of proposals to do so along those paths

<P>They are barring all activities of this type by member states, and only
<BR>
seek to negotiate with non-member states, like the US, to cease such
<BR>
activities. IMHO, the EU actions against Echelon are merely at the
<BR>
behest of France, which has been actively using its intelligence
<BR>
apparatus for commercial espionage for years, doesn't like getting its
<BR>
hands caught in the cookie jar, and can't imagine that their traditional
<BR>
rivals, the Brits, would not use their own intelligence apparatus in a
<BR>
similar manner.... They act like they are the Protector Generale of
<BR>
human rights in public, but operate an almost mafia-like intelligence
<BR>
operation. I lost a job once because of French Intelligence, they got
<BR>
one of my old screeds against mass transit on this list, and the
<BR>
software company I worked for here is owned by the French National
<BR>
Railway. They were doing background checks on all american employees,
<BR>
for no apparent purpose.
