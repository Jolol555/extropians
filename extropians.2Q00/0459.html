<EM>&gt; I'm no &quot;sociological guru&quot;, but I sure love to speculate :-)  In the
</EM><BR>
short-
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and intermediate-term, wearables with really good real-time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality-augmentation agents could give their users a huge advantage in all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sorts of human activities.  They could also cause a kind of mental fatigue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for their users the like of which we've never seen before in human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience.  Feel flooded with information and overwhelmed with the need
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;keep up&quot; with all the channels of communication you have available to you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now?  Just wait for the era of true ubiquitous telecommunications.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wonder whether the ealiest adopters of really capable wearables might
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; experience a massive surge in competitive advantage simply because it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take some time to work out the best balance of info-flow and basic monkey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ability to deal with the dataflood that will be available.  Perhaps by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time the early adopters work out just what a workable interface is like,
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; price will be so low that a mass market will be able to afford them - sort
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; like what happened with PCs and the web.
</EM><BR>
<P>Might it not also be true that later adopters might benefit from not having
<BR>
to reinvent the wheel?  In other words, later adopters could benefit from
<BR>
the experience of the early adopters rather than having to figure a lot of
<BR>
this stuff out for themselves?  This does appear to be the case with a lot
<BR>
of other technologies, especially if one holds one's money back until the
<BR>
technology develops more and gets cheaper in the process.
<BR>
<P>Also, there does seem to be on this list and in the culture in general the
<BR>
idea that adopting innovations early is always beneficial.  But innovations
<BR>
are not always progressive!  Take central banking for instance.  This
<BR>
&quot;social&quot; innovation came about in the early 19th century and is practically
<BR>
ubiquitous today, yet it seems pretty regressive in many ways.  Britain, who
<BR>
adopted it first, lagged behind the US in the late 19th and early 20th
<BR>
century.  (Of course, the US tried to emulate the practice many times but
<BR>
failed until the early 20th century, so this is not really an example of a
<BR>
later adopter learning from the experience of an early adopter.)
<BR>
<P>This is not to say I believe wearable computers are not innovative.  (True
<BR>
be told, the idea has been around since the 1970s and, if my memory's
<BR>
correct, Xybernaut, who recently got a lot of press over this has been
<BR>
manufacturing them since the mid-1990s.  (Early customers included the US
<BR>
Navy.  I actually talked to someone working for Xybernaut in 1997 --
<BR>
business related.)  The major barrier to their current widespread use
<BR>
appears to be price.  The line Xybernaut sells is above laptop prices, which
<BR>
puts them beyond the range of the average computer consumer.  See
