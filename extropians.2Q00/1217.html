<EM>&gt; &gt;  2) Make the punishment for &quot;stealing-a-living&quot; crimes like burglary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  significantly less pleasant than working a menial job. Personally I
</EM><BR>
favor
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  replacing our current prison sentences with much shorter terms served
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  strict solitary confinement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Solitary makes crazy people. They go apeshit and beat people up and become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more irrational than before they went in. We don't want that.
</EM><BR>
<P>It all depends on the details. If you lock a man in an unlit closet and
<BR>
shove food through a slot in the door for six months he's going to be nutty
<BR>
as a fruitcake when you let him out. If you give him lights, plumbing and an
<BR>
eight-foot square cell with a tiny little barred window, he'll just be
<BR>
severely chastened.
<BR>
<P>That was the normal setup for prisons up until the late 19th century, and
<BR>
most of the people who got put away for moderate lengths of time seemed to
<BR>
come out OK. Since we aren't going to be starving them, and we aren't going
<BR>
to have the problems with rats and disease that primitive prisons faced, I
<BR>
doubt that anyone who wasn't severely unstable to begin with would be in
<BR>
danger.
<BR>
<P>But if the effects are actually more severe than I believe, that just means
<BR>
we can shorten the sentence a bit more. Make it a few weeks in solitary,
<BR>
instead of several months. The point is simply to make the prisoner's stay
<BR>
as unpleasant as possible without doing him lasting harm.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One comedian had the best idea I have ever heard. Make inmates peddle
</EM><BR>
bikes
<BR>
<EM>&gt; all day and night to provide electricity for the whole nation. No one will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever want to go back after ten years of that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Heh. I like it.
<BR>
<P>Actually, hard labor is not a bad alternative for this purpose. If the
<BR>
choice is between stocking shelves at the grocery store or breaking rocks in
<BR>
prison, the guy who doesn't want to bother working has a clear incentive not
<BR>
to become a criminal. I think you'd still want shorter sentences that we
<BR>
have now - maybe 4-6 months of labor instead of a year of current-style
<BR>
jail.
