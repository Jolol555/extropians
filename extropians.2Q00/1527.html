<P>{8^D  har.  Actually Mike, exactly the opposite is true.  After I
<BR>
became an atheist, I became a much more moral, ethical and
<BR>
circumspect person methinks.  When one has no moral framework
<BR>
handed to one, no simple written-out code of conduct, no god
<BR>
to impute righteousness and to forgive one's sins, the whole morality
<BR>
scene becomes one's own responsibility.  This is difficult, and
<BR>
thus unpopular with the masses of humanity.  Lets face it,
<BR>
atheism is not exactly catching on like wildfire.  I fear if anything
<BR>
it is losing ground to superstition.  {8-[
<BR>
<P>Today my exerience with &quot;sin&quot; is all talk and no do, whereas had
<BR>
I not discovered atheism it might have been all do and no talk.  spike
