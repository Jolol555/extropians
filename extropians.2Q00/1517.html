<EM>&gt;  For anthems I would suggest Marilyn Manson's &quot;Posthuman&quot; or Dj Spooky's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;Posthuman Sophistry&quot; Both are very nihilistic and futuristic, not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  mention catchy

<P>I agree with Max, anthems probably aren't appropriate anyway ... but...
<BR>
Were Extropians ever nihilists? Seems the opposite to me.  As much as I love 
<BR>
Marilyn Manson and DJ Spooky, I think that any Extropian Anthem would have to 
<BR>
have a much brighter and sunnier genre... a totally NEW genre in fact...
<BR>
<P>Regardless, I have a comment about any anthem that would attach itself to 
<BR>
Extropic Thought/Extropic Art: It would have to be an &quot;automorhing'* tune, 
<BR>
one that changed as it was played, in order to be in anyway able to express 
<BR>
anything Extropic. Or it could be a tune that once sang by an individual, 
<BR>
would then pass to the next, who would add on to it and augment the chords or 
<BR>
rhythm or words in some way -- so that by the passing of one or two days it'd 
<BR>
be completely unrecognizable from what it started at. 
<BR>
That would suit Muse.

<P>(* Automorph is a phrase cleverly coined by Natasha Vita More to describe 
<BR>
self transformation. Examples can be seen on her web sites)
