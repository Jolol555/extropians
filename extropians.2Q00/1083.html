<EM>&gt; &gt;Here's another political incongruity:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Most people who are pro-life (antiabortion) are FOR the death penalty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I guess it's OK to kill children, as long as you wait until they grow up --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;unwanted and in poverty -- so they can kill someone else first!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm pro-choice and pro-death penalty.  At least I'm consistent, but I am 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kind of troubled about what that says about the value I place on human life. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Actually, I changed my stance on the death penalty (from &quot;for&quot; to
<BR>
&quot;against&quot;) because of a discussion on this very list a few years back. 
<BR>
One of the primary reasons I hang out here is that occasionally someone on
<BR>
this list will make such a lucid argument that I am forced to reconsider my
<BR>
positions, which IMO, is a very good thing.
<BR>
<P>While I am very big on individual self defense, I have come to abhor
<BR>
state-sponsored killing in general.  As things currently stand in most if
<BR>
not all countries, the state is not held to the same standards of
<BR>
justifiable homicide as the individual.  While creating such a standard
<BR>
effectively eliminates the death penalty, in the absence of such a
<BR>
standard I would prefer to explicitly eliminate this ability from the
<BR>
state.  Arguably, only individuals can have the right of
<BR>
self-defense anyway, since the government is made up of nothing more than
<BR>
individuals.  The primary advantage of holding the government to the same
<BR>
standards as the individual is that it turns &quot;justifiable homicide&quot; into a
<BR>
double-edged sword; every time the state lowers the standard by which they
<BR>
can kill someone, they increase their own vulnerability to getting
<BR>
legally killed.
