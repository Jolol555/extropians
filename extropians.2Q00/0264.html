Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>This is the continuation of the discussion I have been having with a certain 
<BR>
Jon Fulton of the AdAstra list which is at onelist.com and has about seventy 
<BR>
members.  He is a rather different but he does know his biotech.  I am 
<BR>
grateful to Anders and Robert for having helped me in the discussions.  The 
<BR>
final post by Fulton really revealed his views.  I look forward to reading 
<BR>
what you all think of the points brought up in these posts.
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
<BR>
<P>At onelist.com the mission of AdAstra is given:
<BR>
AdAstra: &quot;A New Humanity For A New Millennium&quot; When Cro-Magnon Man 
<BR>
out-competed Neanderthal in the struggle for survival, the human species 
<BR>
quickly became the dominant life form on this planet. That was arguably the 
<BR>
last major evolutionary advance for our species...and it happened 95 
<BR>
thousand years ago!  Today, as we enter a new millennium, humankind has the 
<BR>
power to take charge of its own evolution using the tools of medical 
<BR>
science, technology, education and social engineering. Ad Astra is a 
<BR>
restricted list dedicated to the proposition that guided evolution 
<BR>
(eugenics) can and should be attempted, and to discussing the logistical and 
<BR>
moral issues attendant upon implementing such an ambitious goal.  Ad Astra 
<BR>
is not affiliated with any political or religious organization, and will 
<BR>
summarily unsubscribe any individual promulgating theories of social 
<BR>
engineering based solely on age, gender, nationality, race, belief system, 
<BR>
sexual preference, or any other arbitrary criterion
<BR>
(end)

<P>Give me a synopsis, dude, I've been unplugged for

almost a month -- without even really &quot;deciding&quot;

I walked off the job that's been eating my brain

for 9 months (ill-considered methodologically but
<BR>
a profoundly necessary mental-health decision)
<BR>
and have been living is blissful if temporary

<P>If his transgressions are egregious, surely I shall boot

the offender. If, however, he is simply being

misguided, idiotic, or just plain wrongheaded he

stays. I've had experience with lists that
<BR>
systematically eradicate dissent, and they all in
<BR>
time degenerate into a mutual head-nodding
<BR>
society. Four legs good, two legs bad,
<BR>
donchaknow.
<BR>
<P>Back from the earth -- spike
<BR>
<P>...and btw I think our archives ARE members only;
<BR>
I'll check on it when I zip over to onelist to

approve yet more subscription requests :)

&quot;Jon Fulton&quot; sure is suspicious. lol!  A coercive utopia is certainly

human race through genetic engineering.  I don't think you understand

<P>my friend Anders Sandberg wrote:
<BR>
As for the devolution, it is on such a tremendously longer timescale
<BR>
than cultural and technological evolution that it is irrelevant for
<BR>
all practical transhumanist aims. We have the technology ~now to start
<BR>
fixing bad genes or at least do prenatal screening, and in the short
<BR>
run we will likely see genetic enhancements. Things like devolution
<BR>
and race will not survive that long outside small groups. The nicest
<BR>
thing is that by leaving the choice up to the parents one can get a
<BR>
distributed, non-coercive system that still achieves the eugenic
<BR>
aims.
<BR>
<P>My impression is that the readers didn't quite get what I was aiming
<BR>
at. Transhumanism + racism will end up becoming transhumanism anyway
<BR>
if you believe we can change the human condition drastically, then
<BR>
puny things like race is becoming *IRRELEVANT*. Who cares if your
<BR>
neighbour had black parents when his skin now is silver and his genes
<BR>
come from 43 different species?  Who cares if his home culture was
<BR>
American when he has modified his personality and adapted to several
<BR>
globalized net cultures. This is likely even more frightening for the
<BR>
PC crowd than the racists...- --
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Don't you all see??  Ultimately, race is not going to matter!  That
<BR>
is the point here.  If anything, our 'mind children(AI)' will be the
<BR>
great challenge for us.

<BR>
<P><P>John,
<BR>
<P>With regard to your question, re: antisense and cocktail viruses...Antisense 
<BR>
RNA or DNA is a well defined technique in molecular biology for turning off 
<BR>
genes.  The principle of antisense is very sound in that it involves the 
<BR>
production (or delivery) of a piece of RNA or DNAin (to) the cell that is 
<BR>
complementary (in DNA base-paring rules)to an expressed messenger RNA.  It 
<BR>
binds to that RNA, preventing it from being turned into protein.
<BR>
<P>There a couple of biotech companies (ISIS, I think is one) whose
<BR>
livelihood is based on in depth knowledge of how to make antisense
<BR>
treatments work, for example in therapies against viruses, such as
<BR>
Hepatitis C.  I believe there are a number of these currently in
<BR>
clinical trials.  My March 2, 2000 issue of Biotechnology News
<BR>
(an expensive industry rag), discusses using &quot;antisense&quot; therapy
<BR>
against the Beta1-adrenergic receptors to reduce blood pressure
<BR>
(work done by Ian Phillips' group at Univ. of Floriday, Gainesville.
<BR>
Studies published in the peer reviewed Hypertension 35:219-24 and
<BR>
Circulation 101:682-8).  If you went to Medline at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,
<BR>
and did a query for &quot;antisense&quot;, I suspect you would get thousands
<BR>
of articles back.  So, &quot;antisense&quot; is very legit.
<BR>
<P>Now, virus cocktails (or combination gene therapies) are a bit Sci-Fi
<BR>
at this point, because we are still in a primitive state of developing
<BR>
the vectors and a host of other little pieces of the toolkit required
<BR>
to make gene therapies work reliably.  As I've discussed before, Greg
<BR>
Stock and John Campbell (from UCLA) doubt that these techniques will
<BR>
ever work (but their sources are really old-school, so you have to take that 
<BR>
position with a grain of salt).  I had a group here in Moscow, that was 
<BR>
using gene therapy to put luciferase genes into the mammary glands of adult 
<BR>
sheep in *1994*.  If we had continued that work we would certainly be 
<BR>
reliably transforming animals to produce specific proteins in their milk by 
<BR>
now.
<BR>
<P>Moving from single treatments to &quot;cocktails&quot; isn't a big deal if they work 
<BR>
reliably.  And since viruses seem to manage to get the whole process to work 
<BR>
fairly reliably, we can presume we will eventually solve the problems.  Its 
<BR>
worth noting that working with an embryo
<BR>
in a dish is much easier than working with live humans because there
<BR>
is no immune system to deal with and you can verify the treatment
<BR>
worked as you wanted.
<BR>
<P>The process would involve taking embryos
<BR>
with cells at the totipotent stage, separating the cells into single
<BR>
cells, administering the therapy, then allowing those cells to redevelop 
<BR>
into new embryos.  Taking a single cell from each new embryo allows you to 
<BR>
test (via PCR) whether the therapy was successful.  You then implant those 
<BR>
embryo(s) that were successfully treated.  With adults, the verification of 
<BR>
the type &amp; number of cells that took up the therapy is much more difficult.
<BR>
<P>Gene therapy has suffered from premature press that it was going to
<BR>
cure a number of things.  Progress has been much slower than people
<BR>
expected, so the crowd of doubters has grounds for their opinions.
<BR>
That doesn't however mean it will never work.  Several treatments
<BR>
for hemophilia are in the works currently that look quite promising.
<BR>
<P>As I'm fond of saying, if you lean on something *long* enough
<BR>
(for example Sequoia trees), it *will* fall over.
<BR>
As far a Fulton's opinion goes, he may not know Anders and so has
<BR>
no way of knowing whether the information is regurgitated popular
<BR>
press, or serious scientific thought.
<BR>
<P>Different people have different approaches for meme policing.  To my mind, 
<BR>
the mark of a wise man, isn't whether they stick their foot in their mouth, 
<BR>
but whether they acknowledge it when you point out the shoe polish around 
<BR>
their lips. Anders, like myself, has a mind that can take significant 
<BR>
engineering challenges and make them &quot;small&quot;, relative to the amount of 
<BR>
actual work that might be required.
<BR>
<P>That is a big difference however, from making claims about stuff that 
<BR>
currently seems pretty impossible, e.g. anti-gravity.  Most people are not 
<BR>
aware of the rates of change in various disciplines (genomics, robotics, 
<BR>
computers, AI, software assistants, etc.) that are likely to make problems 
<BR>
that seem &quot;big&quot; today, quite &quot;small&quot; in the future, so they tend to get put 
<BR>
off when we assume extraordinary &quot;leaps&quot; of progress in our discussions. 
<BR>
Feel free to forward this to other individuals/lists if you feel it is 
<BR>
useful.

<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>This is true, most 3'-5' oligos are given exogenously tosuppress
<BR>
mRNA transcripts, be they of self or viral origin. The DNA-RNA
<BR>
heteroduplex is degraded, making a dominant negative for the
<BR>
duration of treatment. While one MIGHT be able to put an antisense
<BR>
copy of a targeted gene into a retrovirus or episomal DNA virus
<BR>
under some inducable transactivated promoter, it's speculation
<BR>
similar to a &quot;Dyson sphere&quot; at this point in time, IOW, still
<BR>
out of reach, if technically even possible. No one has seriously tried 
<BR>
introducing or suppressing genes in the embryo during development by this 
<BR>
method, and it probably won't WORK because it's hard to target, difficult to 
<BR>
control, and still doesnt even work well in tissue culture, not to mention 
<BR>
the fact that the cells themselves seem to have the ability to supress 
<BR>
foreign nucleic acid synthesis, be it by interferon-alpha/beta inducible 
<BR>
inhibitors of translation elongation-factors as well as inducible 
<BR>
exonucleases. (translation factors come into play because of course a virus 
<BR>
must make sufficient copies of itself to provide template, and that requires 
<BR>
so called viral immediate-early and early gene products (proteins, of a 
<BR>
sort, not usually carried within the capsid itself).
<BR>
<P>-Transgenes as a whole are nothing new, most of our lab rodents are 
<BR>
trangenic for something, especially canonical T-cell receptor beta chains, 
<BR>
but a number carry human genes. This involves adding altered blastomeres at 
<BR>
the morula stage to an embryo, an invitro
<BR>
process but NOT an antisense dominant negative phenocopy. It still
<BR>
requires several mating backcrosses, as the first generation is a
<BR>
mosaic. On the other hand, it's also untargeted, and random insertion
<BR>
of transcriptionally active sequences into the genome are not a
<BR>
good thing, witness most formes of leukemia.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
embryo allows you to test (via PCR) whether the therapy was  successful.  
<BR>
You then implant those embryo(s) that were successfully  treated.

<P>PCR is a licensed trade name, call it &quot;template directed elongation&quot; when 
<BR>
talking to your &quot;biotech freinds&quot; unless they are FROM Promega corp.
