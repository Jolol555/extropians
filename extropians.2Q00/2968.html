<BR>
<P>Why would a person WANT to keep a leash on AI's?  Would it be rational for
<BR>
the less intelligent to control the more intelligent?  Could the superhuman
<BR>
intelligence (whatever form it might take) function if it were fettered?
<BR>
<P>Suppose the first AI is created with a meta-constraint to do no harm to any
<BR>
human and to build this same constraint into every succeeding AI that the
<BR>
first AI might devise.  Without even considering generations of AI's beyond
<BR>
F1 and F2 I can see major problems that would arise if humans attempted to
<BR>
control them.  For example, the AI's, being more intelligent than the
<BR>
humans, might be in a position to better predict when harm would result from
<BR>
a particular course of action a human wanted to engage in.  Thus, if a human
<BR>
demands that the AI perform a service that the AI judges to be ultimately
<BR>
harmful to the human, the AI would be bound by the meta constraint to
<BR>
refuse.  But assuming that the human is acting in what he considers to be
<BR>
his own best interest, the AI's refusal to follow his orders will be
<BR>
interpreted as mutiny (or at least malfunction).
<BR>
<P>I must confess I've only read one of Isaac Asimov's robot books, and that
<BR>
was a long time ago (it was so long ago that I've forgotten the title).  He
<BR>
may well cover these sorts of issues in those books.
