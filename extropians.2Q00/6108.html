<P>
I'm a little behind watching the Charlie Rose series on PBS this past
<BR>
week which dealt with genomics.  Wednesday included an interview with
<BR>
James Watson, co-discoverer of DNA, who played a significant part in
<BR>
getting the Human Genome Project going.
<BR>
<P>Watson is a colorful character (only 73 but looking a lot older to me).
<BR>
He was more willing than the people on earlier in the show to take a
<BR>
chance, make predictions and endorse unpopular views.
<BR>
<P>He believes and hopes that many forms of cancer will be curable within the
<BR>
next decade.  He said he hoped to see it within his lifetime.  He feels
<BR>
that we actually knew enough of the basic science of cancer in some sense,
<BR>
that we have the big picture, but that there are a lot of little details
<BR>
to be solved in order to come up with effective treatments with no side
<BR>
effects, etc.
<BR>
<P>Asked about &quot;playing God&quot; and such, Watson very reasonably pointed out
<BR>
that the important issue is the ability to heal sick people, giving
<BR>
the example of the Salk polio vaccine as a real &quot;miracle&quot;.  Asked point
<BR>
blank, he stated that he did not believe in God, adding wryly that his
<BR>
father had the same position and he had never departed from his family's
<BR>
religious views.
<BR>
<P>Watson said that misuse of the technology was not his main concern; he
<BR>
was more worried about disuse.  Presumably he was talking about people
<BR>
refusing to use it due to various fears and worries.
<BR>
<P>Watson also endorsed the idea that people should be in control of the
<BR>
information about their own genetic code, with women also having the
<BR>
information about their unborn children.  Government should neither
<BR>
mandate nor forbid screening.  The information should be available
<BR>
and individuals should decide what to do with it.  He emphasized the
<BR>
importance of education so that people could make informed decisions.
<BR>
A very refreshing attitude after the interview Tuesday with the religious
<BR>
head of the HGP.
<BR>
<P>I wish Rose had asked Watson about cloning and germ line modifications.
<BR>
It would be nice to have someone on this series who makes the case for
<BR>
self-improvement, and Watson looks like the best chance so far.
<BR>
