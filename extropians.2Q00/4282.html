<EM>&gt;     &gt; So what if someone sees me react to something that for them hasn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; even been transmitted yet?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you had a FTL modem you could also receive a message from yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before you sent it, that's exactly why physicists get queasy when they talk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about faster than light signaling. Example: You just knocked over your coffee
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cup by accident.  Rather than clean it up you sent yourself an E Mail to the you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of 60 seconds ago, you tell yourself that the cup is dangerously near your elbow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and to be careful or you'll break it. You take the advice and put the cup in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; safe place, it does not get knocked over. So who sent the message, and why did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he sent it when there is nothing to warn about?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Right, I get that. What I still don't get is how being able to send
<BR>
something FTL allows me to send info back in time. Intuitively for me,
<BR>
it seems that sending something very fast (or instantly) could not allow
<BR>
me to send info back in time. I definitely could send info to someone
<BR>
else who hasn't seen the photons yet telling them to &quot;hey look here and
<BR>
watch my coffee spill&quot;, but that is not a paradox. But I don't see how
<BR>
I can send myself a message in the past once the coffee has already spilled
<BR>
and I've seen it.
<BR>
<P>All these paradoxes seem to be based on relativistic formulas (Einstein)...
<BR>
but do these formulas make sense in FTL situations?
