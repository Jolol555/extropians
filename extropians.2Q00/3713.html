<P>Vasteras -&gt; Västerås  [Diacritical marks are _not_ optional in Swedish.]
<BR>
<P>Those heating systems appear in many places in Sweden.  They pump warm water
<BR>
through rubber tubes under some sidewalks in many city centres. I find them
<BR>
quite practical in the winter. Less old ladies who break their legs seems a
<BR>
rather good feature to me. Normally the systems work well, unless there is a
<BR>
_heavy_ snowfall.
<BR>
<P>Moving pavements would not work very well in a climate with snow. There exists
<BR>
one at a Stockholm underground train station. It moves humans from one part of
<BR>
the station to another part. Like a moving staircase, only horizontal.
<BR>
<P>Automated information systems replace static and human operated systems.
<BR>
Automated ticket buying systems replace human operated ticket selling.
<BR>
Automated filling stations replace human operated stations.
<BR>
The list goes on..
<BR>
<P>I have seen lift operators in old movies.
<BR>
Never seen any of those in real life, though. Do they still exist?
