<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Yes.  It says that my ideas of morality are not identical to those of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;current lawmakers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Morality is not the issue.  Legality is.  They are not synonyms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That appears (to me) to be exactly what I said.  The lack of synonymity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*is* the issue.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really.  There is nothing requiring you to have the same morals as our 
<BR>
legislators (or anybody else for that matter).  However, you are required to 
<BR>
obey the laws of the land.  Ergo, your desire to be free to &quot;commit a crime 
<BR>
and get away with it&quot; does not necessarily follow from the fact that your 
<BR>
&quot;ideas of morality are not identical to those of our current lawmakers.&quot;  In 
<BR>
other words your desire to be free to &quot;commit a crime and get away with it&quot; 
<BR>
(assuming for the moment that this is in fact your desire) does not suggest 
<BR>
anything about your morals, other than the fact that you want to be able to 
<BR>
commit crime with impunity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I presume, from your statements below, that you are not actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suggesting I avoid my partner until such time as a few ridiculous laws are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;taken off the books.
</EM><BR>
<P>My opinion regarding the illegality of sodomy has been thoroughly stated and 
<BR>
I take it from your comment that you understand exactly where I'm coming 
<BR>
from on that.  In short the answer is: no, if I were gay I would not refrain 
<BR>
from engaging in homosexual activity with a mutually consenting partner of 
<BR>
my own gender simply because it may be illegal in the state where I live.  
<BR>
Admittedly, that doesn't make it right, moral or legal.  But it's just the 
<BR>
way *I* would handle that situation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There is nothing to cause the government to differentiate the exceptions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(and they are different for everybody) from the 'norm.'  There is no place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the books where laws are marked as either having or lacking 'moral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;authority.'
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  And if I choose to violate a law that *for me* lacks sufficient 
<BR>
moral authority to compel my obedience, I would knowingly accept the risks 
<BR>
attendant that illegal behavior, including arrest, prosecution, conviction 
<BR>
and (possibly) incarceration.  Sometimes going with your conscience carries 
<BR>
a steep price, even when you are &quot;right&quot;.  I'm sure Nelson Mandela could 
<BR>
tell you all about it.
<BR>
<P>But, again, that IMO is not reason enough to deprive the state or the public 
<BR>
of the means by which to detect criminal behavior.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Since the government does not make this same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;distinction that you do, our only protection is that they cannot keep a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;constant eye on us.
</EM><BR>
<P>Assuming that sodomy is illegal in your state, then that law infringes upon 
<BR>
your civil rights.  I certainly can't tell you what *you* should do about 
<BR>
that.  But if a law was on the books in my state that infringed *my* civil 
<BR>
rights (say if it suddenly became illegal for me to make love to my wife, 
<BR>
for instance) I would take the Martin Luther King approach to legislative 
<BR>
rectification.  It may not be convenient, it may not be quick, heck it may 
<BR>
not even work.  But that is the approach *I* would take.
<BR>
<P>Certainly that approach carries with it certain significant drawbacks 
<BR>
(namely potentially losing one's life, liberty or property), so I would not 
<BR>
fault you for choosing not to take that path.  But IMO your desire for the 
<BR>
&quot;easy way out&quot; is, again, not sufficient reason for me to support curtailing 
<BR>
the ability of the government or the public to detect criminal behavior.
<BR>
<P>In a sense (and please correct me if I'm wrong) it sounds like your position 
<BR>
is &quot;Hey I disagree with certain laws and I violate them from time to time.  
<BR>
I don't want to challenge those laws openly for fear of the repercussions 
<BR>
that may follow.  So do me, and every other criminal in the nation, a favor 
<BR>
and stop advocating that the ability of the government to detect criminal 
<BR>
behavior be enhanced.&quot;  And my reply is &quot;sorry, no can do.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;When we have succeeded in repealing all the laws
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which I consider immoral, ask me again about surveilance cameras.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well if we repeal all the laws *you* consider immoral, we would logically 
<BR>
have to do the same for everybody.  And before long, there would not remain 
<BR>
a single law on the books.  In that event, who needs surveillance since 
<BR>
every act imaginable is perfectly legal?  Including my coming to your house, 
<BR>
raping and murdering you and your life partner.  Is that the world you 
<BR>
really want?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;No, that's not what I meant.  However, looking above, I see that I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;semantically inaccurate.  I didn't mean these conversations were actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;illegal, I meant that they could be, in the government's view, 'probable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cause for suspicion.'
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Probable cause for suspicion&quot; gives the police no legal right to do 
<BR>
anything except continue to watch you.  As long as your conduct remains this 
<BR>
side of illegal, that is all they can *legally* do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This can be awfully inconvenient even for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;law-abiding citizen--take as an example Steve Jackson Games, who got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;raided by the FBI on suspicion of computer crime for putting out a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cyberpunk game.  Just because an action is legal doesn't mean a recording
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of it, especially out of context, can't get one into trouble.
</EM><BR>
<P>The recording of legal activity will (most times) not get you convicted, or 
<BR>
even prosecuted.  If I recall correctly Steve Jackson Games was eventually 
<BR>
cleared and I believe he sued and was compensated somewhat for his trouble.  
<BR>
I can't argue with you about the inconvenience that innocent citizens can 
<BR>
sometimes be subject to.  But the right to convenience was never promised to 
<BR>
you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I know what the law is.  I know my rights under it.  I also know of many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cases in which the government has bent the definitions of this law and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ignored these rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I know what the cops can and cannot legally do to me.  But I live in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;New York City area.  I do have a certain security in not being a young
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;black male, but my awareness of actual police behavior makes my trust in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them less than absolute.
</EM><BR>
<P>No question.  Cops aren't perfect.  Legislators aren't perfect.  Judges 
<BR>
aren't perfect.  Juries aren't perfect.  These are problems.  But, again, I 
<BR>
don't think the solution lies in hindering the ability of law enforcement to 
<BR>
do their jobs.  Maybe that is the solution, but I don't see it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;current technological capacity, no one can be called lazy merely for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;having missed some bandwidth.  You, for example, seem to have placed a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;great deal of emphasis on keeping up with legal policy.  This is to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;commended.  However, one of the trade-offs seems to have been your missing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information concerning times when law-abiding people have managed to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in trouble with the law, in spite of not actually having broken it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have never denied that this is an unfortunate fact of life.  As long as 
<BR>
our law enforcement duties are carried out by imperfect humans it is a 
<BR>
problem we will have to live with.  However, again, I don't think the 
<BR>
solution to the problem lies in tying the hands of those we have entrusted 
<BR>
to carry out the laws.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Living in ignorance of the law, and then cowering in fear that you might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; accidentally run afoul of it is not excuse enough for me to favor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; constraining the right of the public or the government to detect 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;criminal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; behavior, even by the admittedly drastic means of surveillance.  But I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; recognize that, as in most things, your mileage may vary.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I am not ignorant, but I do acknowledge that my information may not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complete.  I am not cowering, but I do base my caution levels on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information that I have.  The information that I have suggests that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neither the government nor Lockheed-Martin can be trusted with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;responsibility implicit in surveilance.
</EM><BR>
<P>Please don't misunderstand me.  I did not mean at all to imply that you were 
<BR>
ignorant or cowering.  To the extent my wording led you to believe otherwise 
<BR>
I sincerely apologize (God knows I don't need another flame war on this 
<BR>
issue).  But if, in your opinion, the government cannot be entrusted with 
<BR>
the responsibiliy to observe its citizens, then in effect, your position is 
<BR>
that the government cannot be entrusted to enforce the law.  Perhaps this is 
<BR>
true.  But if not the government, then who?
<BR>
<P>I know as much as anybody else that our government is not perfect.  I know 
<BR>
that innocent people sometimes get arrested, even convicted, sometimes 
<BR>
executed.  I know that some cops are incompetent and even malicious.  But, 
<BR>
again, I don't see how forcing the police to wear blind folds constitutes a 
<BR>
solution to any of those problems.
<BR>
