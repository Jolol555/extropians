<P>
Just a bit more.
<BR>
<P>In the original article cited by Spudboy,  my attention was drawn in
<BR>
particular to a couple of points:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From the following section,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;At the Cleveland Clinic, doctors have cooled five victims of especially
</EM><BR>
severe strokes, &gt;dropping their temperatures a few degrees for a day or
<BR>
two. Ordinarily, 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;80 percent of such people die or are seriously disabled. Against the odds,
</EM><BR>
two of these five
<BR>
<EM>&gt;recovered completely. 
</EM><BR>
<P>note the phrases &quot;especially severe&quot;, and &quot;recovered completely&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Now, that's &quot;completely&quot; from a journalist, not necessarily a neurological
<BR>
professional, but nevertheless...
<BR>
<P>And from the section immediately following,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Doctors at the University of Texas in Houston saw similar results cooling
</EM><BR>
victims of cardiac
<BR>
<EM>&gt;arrest. Like a stroke, cardiac arrest wrecks the brain by shutting off its
</EM><BR>
blood supply. Victims
<BR>
<EM>&gt;often suffer permanent brain damage, even 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if paramedics eventually restart their hearts. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The Houston doctors chilled seven patients who arrived at the hospital in
</EM><BR>
comas 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;after being resuscitated. After a day of cooling, two of them soon
</EM><BR>
returned completely to &gt;normal, while another is nearly so. 
<BR>
<P>note the phrase:
<BR>
<P>&quot;two ...returned completely to normal, while another nearly so.&quot;
<BR>
<P>My point is that the degree of efficacy implied here is very high, such is
<BR>
the inference of the juxtaposition of the two phrases &quot;especially severe&quot;
<BR>
and &quot;recovered completely&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Then, if you add to that, the results of the treatments reported in the
<BR>
following article:
<BR>
<P>Improvement in some patients who underwent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neuronal transplantation following stroke
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.eurekalert.org/releases/upmc-iis033100.html">http://www.eurekalert.org/releases/upmc-iis033100.html</A>
<BR>
<P>(which, by the way, also implies--though established medical researchers
<BR>
avoid the topic like the plague--the possibilty of reversing age-related
<BR>
neuron loss, ie brain rejuvenation), you're looking at THE CURE FOR STROKE
<BR>
(and brain aging?).
<BR>
<P>Certainly there's more work to be done, such as developing a scanning and
<BR>
monitoring system which will allow the prediction of likely events and the
<BR>
immediate signalling of actual events, as well as--while I'm making a
<BR>
shopping list--a means of remediating the accumulation of circulatory
<BR>
&quot;sludge&quot; which (excepting burst blood vessels) is the primary cause of
<BR>
strokes.
<BR>
<P>What I'm saying here is that the prospect for major strides in disposing of
<BR>
the monstrous ugliness, the godawful expense, and the general plague of
<BR>
human suffering associated with the brain-blasted, vegged-out, pitiful,
<BR>
helpless, desperate horror of aged loved ones and their families, which is
<BR>
the story of stroke,  well, .... I LOVE SCIENTISTS AND I LOVE SCIENCE.
<BR>
<P>Hoo-flippin-rah.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
