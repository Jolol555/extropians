<P><EM>&gt; Not only that, she spent here nights at a bar instead of preparing for

<EM>&gt;  court.

<P>Why James,  did you pick her up one night ; ) ? I want to hear the whole 
<BR>
story if you did... Enquiring minds want to know 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;  She tried to bully the Jury and Judge just like she used to get away with

<EM>&gt;  when railroading LA gang-bangers!

<P>The only useful thing that came out of that trial was the effect it had on us 
<BR>
here in LA.
<BR>
<P>Up until that trial most white suburban sheltered people figured the police 
<BR>
and prosecution were at least SOMEWHAT on track as far as doing their job. 
<BR>
They had no idea what was really going on, even after the Rodney King trials, 
<BR>
which could still be argued that the police had a right to jump him, he was 
<BR>
indeed, a very f**ked up individual, and scary. If you were from a sheltered 
<BR>
suburb and white you could easily think: that could never happen to me&quot;, he 
<BR>
deserved it.
<BR>
<P>OJ's trial clearly showed how inept, corrupt and flat out BAD our police 
<BR>
department was. And it resulted in letting a murderer walk the streets 
<BR>
because NO ONE, black or white, could say that the police were NOT capable of 
<BR>
tampering evidence, and framing a man. Not to any certainty. 
<BR>
Sure he had money so he got off... a poorer man would not, but this time the 
<BR>
tide turned against the prosecutors. It was an eye-opener for the whole city.
<BR>
<P>Now, in light of the recent developments w/the LAPD and the framing 
<BR>
indictments it looks as if no one really learned anything -- at least not 
<BR>
within our gang task force. (If anywhere in the department).
