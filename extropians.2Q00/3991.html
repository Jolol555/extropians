<EM>&gt; All privacy *really will* be lost, and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;isnt at all clear to me how one would defend against it without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;spending buttloads of money, an option closed to the poor.  spike

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance.  It may or may not become ubiquitous.  But if it does, me

<EM>&gt; thinks the best defense will be to live a life that you would not be ashamed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have broadcast to the world.

<P>Sure, but consider the group most likely to be impacted.  Not movie, TV
<BR>
and rock stars, for they are already under constant watch by
<BR>
multiple photographers and groupies, and they can afford to defeat
<BR>
the watcher's technology.  The group I have in mind for most impact is
<BR>
college students.  Being watched by other college students.  I dont know
<BR>
about you, but when I was in college I was doing good to afford food,
<BR>
never mind sophisticated antisurveillance tech.
<BR>
<P>This camera thing is a lot like guns in many ways.  They really cannot
<BR>
be outlawed.  If they outlaw cameras, only outlaws will have cameras.
<BR>
They are getting steadily smaller and cheaper.  They can be used for
<BR>
good or evil, and you can bet they will be used for both.  Criminals
<BR>
are toast.  But perhaps so are we, if we really want *assurance* that
<BR>
no one is watching us in our bedrooms.
<BR>
<P>So far I have taken the stance that our attitudes do not matter much.
<BR>
Surveillance is coming anyway.  I still think that.  spike
