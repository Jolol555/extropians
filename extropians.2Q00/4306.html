Biotech Bytes: Who's Winning the Frankenfoods Fight?
<BR>
<P>Quote of the Month:
<BR>
<P>&quot;There are two things that most of us feel. We feel hurt and we feel
<BR>
angry...  We had real leadership... We had... faith in this science when
<BR>
others were dubious, and it all seemed to be working. So we painted a big
<BR>
bull's-eye on our chest, and we went over the top of the hill.&quot;  Robert
<BR>
Shapiro, CEO of Monsanto, quoted in The New Yorker magazine April 10, 2000.
<BR>
__________________________________________________________________
<BR>
<P>The worst nightmares of Monsanto and the Gene Giants are becoming reality.
<BR>
The four year food fight by European consumers and farmers is slowly but
<BR>
surely driving genetically engineered (GE) foods and crops off the EU
<BR>
market, the largest in the world. US corn exports to the EU have fallen
<BR>
from $360 million a year to near zero, while soybean exports have fallen
<BR>
from $2.6 billion annually to $1 billion--and are expected to fall even
<BR>
further as major food processors, supermarkets, and fast-food chains ban GE
<BR>
soy or soy derivatives in animal feeds. Canada's canola exports to Europe
<BR>
similarly have fallen from $500 million a year to near zero. Meanwhile
<BR>
Brazilian exporters are doing a brisk business selling &quot;GE-free&quot; soybeans
<BR>
to European buyers, and organic food is booming throughout the
<BR>
industrialized world. On May 18 the latest in a series of GE scandals
<BR>
rocked Europe as a major rapeseed (canola) seller, Advanta Seeds, a
<BR>
division of biotech giant AstraZeneca, admitted that genetic drift from
<BR>
gene-altered canola fields in Canada had contaminated certified &quot;non-GE
<BR>
seed&quot; export shipments to Britain, France, Germany and Sweden.
<BR>
<P>Consumer rejection of gene-foods is steadily spreading to Japan, South
<BR>
Korea, Australia, New Zealand, India, and a host of other nations,
<BR>
including the United States and Canada.  Japan and South Korea-where public
<BR>
concern is rising--have the biotech industry extremely worried, since these
<BR>
two nations alone buy $11.3 billion of US agriculture exports every year.
<BR>
On May 18 the Tokyo Grain Exchange soy futures market begin for the first
<BR>
time to offer wholesale traders a choice of GE or non-GE soybeans. On the
<BR>
first day of trading, non-GE buyers committed to 914,000 tons, compared to
<BR>
only 364,000 tons for unsegregated (GE-tainted) US soybean futures.
<BR>
<P>Gene-foods and patents on living organisms have become hot button political
<BR>
issues in India, Thailand, Malaysia, Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines.
<BR>
At recent international conventions such as the Biosafety Protocol meeting
<BR>
in Montreal in January and the UN Codex Alimentarius meeting in Ottawa in
<BR>
May, the US government has become increasingly isolated in its &quot;no
<BR>
labeling, no safety-testing&quot; position.
<BR>
<P>Since the first of the year, prospects for a Biotech Century have dimmed
<BR>
considerably. Among the most recent  blows to the agbiotech industry have
<BR>
been the following:
<BR>
<P>* Storm clouds in Asia. Japan dropped a regulatory bombshell in mid-April
<BR>
when the Ministry of Health announced that starting next year agricultural
<BR>
producers must &quot;screen&quot; imported genetically modified foods for potential
<BR>
food allergies and other health hazards. In addition new mandatory labeling
<BR>
rules on GE food ingredients coming into force next April will have a major
<BR>
impact on the marketplace.
<BR>
<P>According to a report by Sharon Schmickle in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune
<BR>
on April 30, Japanese importers and manufacturers of many common food
<BR>
products--including tofu, miso, cornstarch, corn snacks, popcorn and frozen
<BR>
or canned corn--are almost certain to switch to non-genetically engineered
<BR>
ingredients once they're forced to label.  James Echle, who directs the
<BR>
Tokyo office of the American Soybean Association, told the Star-Tribune &quot;I
<BR>
don't think anybody will label containers genetically modified,&quot; he said.
<BR>
&quot;It's like putting a skull and crossbones on your product.&quot;  In a related
<BR>
story from Asia, the government of Sri Lanka formally banned the import of
<BR>
GE foods and crops on April 23.
<BR>
<P>* Patent victory in India. Vandana Shiva and India and EU public interest
<BR>
activists registered a major victory in  mid-May when the European Patent
<BR>
Office withdrew a controversial patent previously granted to pharmaceutical
<BR>
giant W.R. Grace on a chemical formulation derived from the Neem tree,
<BR>
which has been used as a bio-pesticide and medicinal agent for generations
<BR>
by indigenous villagers and farmers in India. Biotech corporations fear
<BR>
that the revocation of the Neem patent will set a precedent that could put
<BR>
billions of dollars of their &quot;biopirated&quot; patents on drugs and seeds at
<BR>
risk.
<BR>
<P>* European opposition to gene-foods is as strong as ever.  A new EU-wide
<BR>
survey, &quot;Eurobarometer,&quot; recently analyzed by the European Commission,
<BR>
showed that consumers in the EU were &quot;deeply wary of genetically modified
<BR>
food.&quot; Professor George Gaskell of the London School of Economics,
<BR>
presenting the study at a news conference on April 27 flatly stated,
<BR>
&quot;Genetically modified foods are getting the thumbs down. They are seen to
<BR>
be very risky.&quot;
<BR>
<P>* America's food giants begin to turn their backs on Frankenfoods.  Even in
<BR>
the heartland of biotech, consumer aversion to GE foods is increasing.
<BR>
Since July, 1999 a number of major US food corporations--including baby
<BR>
food giants Gerber, Heinz, and Mead-Johnson (infant formula); pet food
<BR>
purveyor Iam's; corn chip king Frito-Lay; and several sizable supermarket
<BR>
chains, Whole Foods, Wild Oats, and Genuardi's, have announced plans to go
<BR>
&quot;GE free.&quot;  On May 9 in Chicago at the convention of the Food Marketing
<BR>
Institute, a trade association of supermarket corporations, a number of
<BR>
leading supermarket chains admitted privately that mandatory labeling of GE
<BR>
foods is probably inevitable.
<BR>
<P>* The death of Frankenspuds. Monsanto announced in early May that they were
<BR>
closing down their NatureMark plant in Crystal, Maine, a transgenetic
<BR>
laboratory and greenhouse operation that had been producing Bt potatoes
<BR>
since 1992. Bt potatoes are gene-spliced with the soil bacteria, Bacillus
<BR>
thuringiensis, to repel the Colorado potato beetle. Earlier this year,
<BR>
Monsanto laid off 20 of the 30 employees in their other Bt potato lab in
<BR>
Idaho. Bt potatoes thus join the growing obituary list of Monsanto's
<BR>
Frankenfoods. In 1996 Monsanto/Calgene's Flavr Savr tomatoes were taken off
<BR>
the market after dismal performances in the field and on grocery store
<BR>
shelves.
<BR>
<P>Monsanto's retreat on Bt potatoes comes in the wake of news stories in the
<BR>
Wall Street Journal and Associated Press that America's leading potato
<BR>
buyers--including McDonald's, Burger King, Frito-Lay, and Procter &amp;
<BR>
Gamble--are eliminating Bt potatoes from their brand-name french fries and
<BR>
potato chips. &quot;We have to respect the preferences of our customers, and
<BR>
both the domestic and global restaurant chains which we serve have asked us
<BR>
to exclude these potatoes,&quot; said Fred Zerza, a spokesman for J.R. Simplot,
<BR>
of Boise, Idaho, one of  McDonald's largest suppliers.
<BR>
In November 1999, McCain's and Lamb-Weston, two of North America's largest
<BR>
potato processors,  told farmers they would no longer accept gene-altered
<BR>
spuds.  Approximately 50,000 acres, amounting to 4% of last year's total
<BR>
potato crop, were genetically engineered in North America. Next year Bt
<BR>
spuds may become an extinct species.
<BR>
<P>*  Bt cotton gives rise to &quot;Stink Bug&quot; epidemic. Recent field reports
<BR>
posted indicate that Bt cotton fields in North Carolina and Georgia are
<BR>
becoming
<BR>
infested with Stink Bugs that are eating up the cotton crop. Not only does
<BR>
the Bt toxin not kill the Stink Bugs, but apparently they love the mutant
<BR>
plants. Monsanto's recommendation, posted on their Farmsource web site, is
<BR>
to spray the Stink Bugs with toxic pesticides including methyl parathion,
<BR>
one of the deadliest chemicals used in American agriculture. So much for
<BR>
the notion that Bt cotton will get US farmers off the toxic treadmill.
<BR>
<P>As analysts have pointed out to BioDemocracy News, the pests that
<BR>
Bt-spliced cotton are designed to kill--cotton bollworms, pink bollworms,
<BR>
and budworms--were previously considered harmless &quot;secondary pests&quot; until
<BR>
the overuse of toxic pesticides (sold by the same companies now peddling
<BR>
so-called &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; Bt crops--Monsanto, Novartis, and
<BR>
Aventis) killed off their natural predators and parasites and turned them
<BR>
into major pests.
<BR>
<P>* More bad news for Monsanto. Recent studies carried out at the University
<BR>
of Nebraska indicate that gene-altered Roundup Ready soybeans produce 6-11%
<BR>
less yield than conventional soybeans.The two year study, reported by the
<BR>
Associated Press on May 18, showed Roundup Ready soybeans yield 6% less
<BR>
than their closest relatives and 11% less than high-yielding soybean
<BR>
varieties. In another damaging revelation, Dr. Charles Benbrook, a
<BR>
consultant for the Consumers Union, published a summary of an upcoming
<BR>
report revealing that genetically engineered Roundup Ready soybeans,
<BR>
contrary to frequent claims by Monsanto, actually use 2-5 times more pounds
<BR>
of herbicide per acre than conventional soybeans sprayed with other &quot;modern
<BR>
low-dose pesticides.&quot; For background information see a previous study by
<BR>
Benbrook on RR soybeans
<BR>
<P>* American farmers back-off on GE. All signs indicate that US farmers are
<BR>
slowly but steadily moving away from GE crops. According to the March 31
<BR>
Associated Press, a recent  USDA survey showed that American farmers will
<BR>
plant 24% less genetically engineered corn this year, 13% less cotton, and
<BR>
9% less soybeans. The Winnipeg Free Press reported on April 24 that farmers
<BR>
in Canada are reducing the amount of acreage devoted to GE canola, perhaps
<BR>
by as much as 10%.
<BR>
<P>* American grain dealers starting to segregate GE crops. A May 4 report on
<BR>
the New York Times website
<BR>
<P>indicates that
<BR>
many of America's grain wholesalers are segregating GE and non-GE corn and
<BR>
soybeans for overseas export, even though they've been telling the public
<BR>
for years that segregation is impossible. &quot;We are encouraging farmers to
<BR>
segregate crops,&quot; said Larry Cunningham, senior vice president for
<BR>
corporate affairs at Archer Daniels Midland. &quot;And we have an opportunity to
<BR>
also benefit from it. In Europe and Japan some people are willing to pay a
<BR>
premium for segregated crops.&quot;
<BR>
<P>According to the Times, &quot;a study conducted by Pioneer Hi-Bred , a
<BR>
subsidiary of DuPont, indicated that, of the 1,200 U.S. [grain] processors
<BR>
surveyed, 24 percent were planning to segregate corn crops this year, up
<BR>
from 11 percent in 1999, and 20 percent were planning to segregate soybean
<BR>
crops, up from 8 percent last year.&quot;
<BR>
<P>*  Opposition to GE foods increases in Canada. A nationwide campaign
<BR>
against Loblaw's, the nation's largest supermarket chain, has the food
<BR>
industry worried.  On May 9 the Council of Canadians, Sierra Club, and a
<BR>
coalition of public interest groups filed a legal petition against the
<BR>
federal government for failing to protect public health and the environment
<BR>
in regulating genetically modified organisms.  Under Canadian law, the
<BR>
government is required to respond to the challenge within 120 days.
<BR>
<P>According to a March 31 poll conducted for the Council of Canadians,
<BR>
three-quarters (75%) of Canadians familiar with GE foods are worried about
<BR>
their safety and almost all (95%) want GE foods labeled as such.  A
<BR>
similarly high number (95%) want consumers to be able to buy non-GE foods,
<BR>
and over two-thirds (71%) would even be willing to pay more to get them.
<BR>
Moreover, most respondents (56%) are not confident in the federal
<BR>
government's ability to protect their health and safety when it comes to GE
<BR>
foods--although grocery retailers say they depend on consumer confidence in
<BR>
government testing.
<BR>
<P>* Anti-GE protests increase in the US.  Four thousand people demonstrated
<BR>
against genetically engineered foods in Boston, Massachusetts on March 26,
<BR>
marching in front of the national convention of the Biotechnology Industry
<BR>
Organization (BIO).  Over the past three months &quot;Frankenfoods dumps&quot;
<BR>
outside supermarkets in Boston, San Francisco, and at the annual
<BR>
shareholders meeting of the Safeway supermarket chain, organized by the
<BR>
Organic Consumers Association (OCA) and Friends of the Earth, have
<BR>
generated significant media coverage and rattled the nerves of the biotech
<BR>
industry.  Meanwhile sabotage of biotech crops has continued in the US,
<BR>
with an April 8 announcement by the &quot;Petaluma Pruners&quot; that they had
<BR>
destroyed GE grape plants grown by the Vinifera corporation in Petaluma,
<BR>
California.
<BR>
<P>* On March 21 anti-GE protesters, led by a group called Grain RAGE
<BR>
(Resistance Against Genetic Engineering), wearing white biohazard suits and
<BR>
respirators, blocked the road to the Cargill corporation's international
<BR>
headquarters outside Minneapolis for several hours. Cargill, the world's
<BR>
largest grain dealer, is one of the most strident proponents of GE crops.
<BR>
ln September Cargill donated $10 million to the University of Minnesota for
<BR>
a plant genetics research facility. Cargill also has strong ties to
<BR>
Monsanto. Cargill sold its international seed business to Monsanto in 1998
<BR>
and has agreed to manufacture commercial livestock and poultry feeds
<BR>
produced from Monsanto's proprietary germ plasm. On May 15 Reuters reported
<BR>
that Ernest Micek, the chairman of Cargill, told a globalization conference
<BR>
sponsored by the Economic Strategy Institute that &quot;while some American
<BR>
consumers are raising concerns
<BR>
about genetically modified foods, they are ignoring the safety risks of
<BR>
organically grown corn, soybeans and other grains.&quot;
<BR>
<P>* On March 21 the Center for Food Safety, the OCA, Greenpeace and 51 other
<BR>
groups filed a legal petition against the FDA in Washington, D.C. calling
<BR>
for a moratorium on all GE foods and crops unless the FDA can prove through
<BR>
<P><P>stringent, long-term safety-testing that these products are safe for human
<BR>
health and the environment.  For further information on the legal petition
<BR>
<P><P>* In Washington 52 members of the US House of Representatives are now
<BR>
co-sponsors of a bill introduced by Dennis Kucinich (Democrat from Ohio)
<BR>
calling for mandatory labeling of GE foods. Kucinich has also drafted a
<BR>
House bill on safety-testing. The Kucinich GE labeling bill has drawn angry
<BR>
criticism from the biotech industry, agribusiness, and the Grocery
<BR>
Manufacturers of America--who maintain that mandatory labeling would unduly
<BR>
alarm consumers and thereby kill the industry. Companion bills on safety
<BR>
testing (Patrick Moynihan, Democrat from New York) and labeling (Barbara
<BR>
Boxer, Democrat from California) have been introduced in the US Senate as
<BR>
well. For further information on the grassroots lobbying campaign to get
<BR>
these bills passed in Congress
<BR>
<P>* More than two dozen bills related to gene-foods have been filed in US
<BR>
state legislatures over the past year year in at least 13 states; dealing
<BR>
with issues such as the &quot;Terminator&quot; seed technology, registration of
<BR>
farmers planting GE crops, and labeling gene-altered foods.  Although these
<BR>
bills have been held up in committee or rejected in the face of concerted
<BR>
lobbying by powerful biotech and agribusiness special interests, their
<BR>
proliferation is evidence that more and more politicians are feeling the
<BR>
heat from constituents on GE foods.
<BR>
*  Swiss panel slams EPA. A prestigious panel of Swiss scientists,
<BR>
commissioned by Greenpeace, on April 19 issued a peer-reviewed critique of
<BR>
the shoddy science endorsed by the EPA to certify the environmental safety
<BR>
of Bt corn. The EcoStrat report reveals that tests submitted by the biotech
<BR>
companies Novartis and Mycogen to determine whether their GE corn could
<BR>
harm non-target insects were so poorly designed that there was virtually no
<BR>
chance that adverse effects would be observed. Despite the flawed
<BR>
methodology, EPA accepted the tests as scientific evidence that the
<BR>
gene-altered crop was harmless to non-target insects, and continued to
<BR>
accept the same flawed testing procedures for approval of other companies'
<BR>
insect-resistant &quot;Bt&quot; crops. According to Dr. Doreen Stabinsky, a science
<BR>
advisor to Greenpeace,  &quot;We now know that EPA's approval of
<BR>
insect-resistant crops was based on false assumptions, shoddy methodology,
<BR>
and skewed results.&quot; For more information on the EcoStrat report see
<BR>
<P><P>*  Investors rebel against gene-foods. Anti-GE shareholder activism in the
<BR>
US has increased considerably since the first of the year. According to the
<BR>
New York Times &quot;Twenty-one resolutions calling for restraints on the use of
<BR>
genetically modified ingredients are on the annual meeting agendas at some
<BR>
of America's leading food and seed manufacturers this year, up from zero a
<BR>
year ago... Shareholders at Coca Cola, Kellogg's, Phillip Morris ,and
<BR>
PepsiCo have already voted on the resolutions, which garnered a respective
<BR>
8.3 percent, 5.6 percent, 4 percent and 3.2 percent of the support of
<BR>
voting shares.&quot; As activists point out, once a company faces opposition
<BR>
from 10-15% of its shareholders on an unpopular position such as using GE
<BR>
ingredients in its products, it will usually change its company policy.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Pharmageddon Strikes Back: Disinformation, TV Ads, Regulatory Reforms
<BR>
<P>Fearful that the global backlash against gene-foods is spreading to the
<BR>
U.S.,  Monsanto, Aventis, Novartis, Dow, BASF, Zeneca, DuPont, and the
<BR>
Biotechnology Industry Organization have launched a $50 million a year
<BR>
public relations campaign to confuse and mislead the American public.
<BR>
<P>Fronting for the Gene Giants, the so-called Council for Biotechnology
<BR>
Information has paid for cheery &quot;biotech is great&quot; national television ads,
<BR>
launched a Web site opened a consumer information
<BR>
hotline, carried out focus groups and polls, and enlisted prominent
<BR>
scientists and public figures (including Andrew Young, ex-ambassador to the
<BR>
United Nations and former Nobel Prize winner Dr. James Watson) to serve as
<BR>
messengers for pro-biotech propaganda. According to the St. Louis
<BR>
Post-Dispatch on April 4, the Council says it may spend as much as $250
<BR>
million on the campaign over the next five years. In the CBI's opening
<BR>
national TV ad, the narrator tries to equate the potential benefits of GE
<BR>
crops with the more widely accepted uses of biotechnology in medicine.
<BR>
<P>Flashing between scenes of farm fields and medical labs, the 60-second ad
<BR>
proclaims: &quot;A patient has a medicine she needs. A boy can survive a
<BR>
childhood disease. A
<BR>
cotton crop helps protect itself from certain pests because discoveries in
<BR>
biotechnology, from medicine to agriculture, are helping doctors and farmers
<BR>
to treat our sick and to protect our crops.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Based upon in-depth interviews and focus groups with American consumers,
<BR>
the Council for Biotechnology Information has begun to hammer home the
<BR>
following points--all of which of course are false:
<BR>
<P>* GE foods have been thoroughly tested by U.S. government agencies and
<BR>
found to be safe.
<BR>
<P>* Biotechnology increases the nutritional content of foods, makes them
<BR>
taste better, and can help feed the world's hungry.
<BR>
<P>* GE crops reduce the use of toxic pesticides.
<BR>
<P>In a national focus group study carried out last September 14-19 by public
<BR>
relations powerhouse BSMG Worldwide on behalf of the Grocery Manufactures
<BR>
of America, a copy of which was obtained by BioDemocracy News, BSMG
<BR>
recommends broadcasting the above &quot;positive messages&quot; to American consumers
<BR>
to counteract their negative views on biotechnology. Unfortunately for the
<BR>
biotech industry, BSMG also learned from interviewing American consumers
<BR>
that there are some major obstacles to public acceptance of GE foods:
<BR>
<P>* American women, who generally do the grocery shopping, are more likely
<BR>
than men to have negative feelings about gene-altered foods. These negative
<BR>
feelings are &quot;rooted in fear of the unknown, fear of negative consequences
<BR>
for human health, and resistance to tampering with nature.&quot;
<BR>
African-Americans are also &quot;notably negative&quot; toward gene-foods, as are
<BR>
senior citizens.
<BR>
<P>* Both men and women overwhelmingly support mandatory labeling of GE foods,
<BR>
and strongly oppose industry efforts to restrict labeling or to make it
<BR>
voluntary.
<BR>
<P>* Only 15% of consumers are aware that the majority of supermarket foods
<BR>
already contain genetically engineered ingredients.
<BR>
<P>* Two-thirds of Americans say they are &quot;concerned&quot; about biotechnology
<BR>
issues. Forty-eight percent say they oppose any use of &quot;genetic
<BR>
modification&quot; in food production.
<BR>
<P>Spoiling the Party: The National Academy of Sciences Report &amp; FDA &quot;Reform&quot;
<BR>
<P>On April 5 the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) released their
<BR>
long-awaited report on genetically engineered crops. While the scientific
<BR>
talking heads at the NAS press conference in Washington tried to reassure
<BR>
the public that GE foods were safe, national TV networks broadcast a
<BR>
different image--outside the NAS headquarters, a crowd of protesters
<BR>
dressed in white lab coats, holding up signs (&quot;The Best Science Money Can
<BR>
Buy&quot;) and giant dollar bills, chanting anti-GE slogans. While the biotech
<BR>
industry applauded the conclusions of the study, nearly every media
<BR>
organization in the country reported that the NAS report was plagued by
<BR>
charges of conflict of interest.  The majority of the dozen scientists on
<BR>
the NAS panel receive money from biotech corporations or labs under
<BR>
contract to the industry, while the original head of the panel, Michael
<BR>
Phillips, left the NAS to work as a PR flack for the Biotechnology Industry
<BR>
Organization.  The media also broadcast the criticisms of consumer and
<BR>
public interest groups that the 261-page NAS report paid little attention
<BR>
to the potential health hazards of GE foods.
<BR>
<P>As Rachel's Environment &amp; Health weekly (May 11) points
<BR>
out, however, a close reading of the NAS report is actually quite damning
<BR>
for the biotech industry and the nation's regulatory agencies (the FDA, the
<BR>
EPA, and the USDA). Among other things the NAS report admits that:
<BR>
<P>* New allergens and toxins may be introduced into foods.
<BR>
<P>* Existing toxins in foods may reach new levels, or may be moved into
<BR>
edible portions of plants.
<BR>
<P>* New allergens may be introduced into pollen, then spread into the
<BR>
environment.
<BR>
<P>* Previously unknown protein combinations now being produced in plants
<BR>
might have unforeseen effects when new genes are introduced into the plants;
<BR>
<P>* Nutritional content of a plant may be diminished.
<BR>
<P>Instead of a whitewash on the safety of GE foods, the NAS report has turned
<BR>
into yet another public relations debacle for the biotech industry.
<BR>
<P>In a similar vein, the Food and Drug Administration's long-anticipated
<BR>
announcement of &quot;regulatory reforms&quot; on GE foods and crops May 3 was met
<BR>
with indifference or hostility on the part of the general public. Headlines
<BR>
across the country emphasized that the FDA was refusing to label GE foods,
<BR>
while reporters noted that every consumer and environmental group in the US
<BR>
was denouncing the FDA maneuvers as &quot;too little and too late.&quot;
<BR>
<P>As we predicted months ago in BioDemocracy News the FDA is calling for
<BR>
nothing more than (1) voluntary industry labeling; (2) non-specific
<BR>
industry-FDA &quot;consultations&quot; before new Frankenfoods and crops are put on
<BR>
the market, and (3) non-specific disclosure of research data by biotech
<BR>
corporations on the internet. As Debbie Ortman, National Field Organizer,
<BR>
of the Organic Consumers Association put it, &quot;The biotech industry
<BR>
consulting with the FDA does not constitute safety-testing, nor is
<BR>
so-called voluntary industry labeling of genetically engineered foods what
<BR>
90% of consumers want--mandatory labeling.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Of course this is not the end of the debate. Battered by mounting public
<BR>
criticism and serious market share loss in Europe and Asia, now spreading
<BR>
to North America, we can expect Monsanto and the Gene Giants to fight back
<BR>
with all they have. In the next issue of BioDemocracy News we will take a
<BR>
critical look at the new generation of genetically engineered products
<BR>
being readied for market: so-called &quot;functional foods,&quot; GE fish,
<BR>
Frankentrees, and other mutants. In the meantime stay tuned , events
<BR>
listings, and action alerts.
