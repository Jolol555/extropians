<EM>&gt; A bit silly, but just a thought: What about having insurance companies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invent and enforce traffic rules - everyone is required to carry some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; policy, but you choose which and are only bound by your providers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regulations.  There's a competitive pressure then on insurers to issue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as few tickets as possible, so as to attract customers, but also to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maximize safety and avoid paying out. That's the trade off we're trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to make, and If anyone's in a position to figure out what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legitimately dangerous driving and what's not, it's people selling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insurance.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's an interesting idea.  It seems that there might be a problem in
<BR>
that it would not discourage driving habits which injured other people
<BR>
more than the driver himself.  However due to the nature of automobile
<BR>
collisions most accidents injure both parties, so this might not be that
<BR>
bad an effect.
<BR>
<P>Robin Hanson had a somewhat analogous idea, which is that health insurance
<BR>
companies would pay out when you die.  Therefore they would have incentive
<BR>
to pay for health treatment which extends your life.  (Unfortunately,
<BR>
Robin has also pointed to research which seems to question the true
<BR>
value of much medical treatment, hence this plan might lead to people
<BR>
getting a lot less medical care than they get today.)
<BR>
<P>The health idea is at <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/buyhealth.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/buyhealth.html</A>, and Robin has
<BR>
a page with a bunch of other ideas at <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/altinst.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/altinst.html</A>.
