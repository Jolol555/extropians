<P><EM>&gt; I am actually somewhat puzzled by this response.  Do you not advocate a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; culture with a strong belief in a right of self-defense?  Considering, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violent crime rates in most European countries exceed those of the United
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; States (with the narrow exception of homicide), it would seem that these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issues need to be taken into consideration the more seriously.  Fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is, I am statistically much safer where I live in the U.S. than most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; places in Europe.  (I don't know about Australia specifically, but I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe it is similar to Europe).
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Let's try some numbers.  Following stats are taken from the www.abs.gov.au
<BR>
site for australian statistics (Australian Bureau of Statistics) and
<BR>
www.fbi.gov and www.objp.usdoj.gov for US statistics. Whenever the US
<BR>
figures are close to each other, i use the FBI figures because the DOJ
<BR>
rates are based on the population over 12 years old and are based on 
<BR>
a survey.  The biggest problem
<BR>
in the comparison is that the FBI figures are based on the number of
<BR>
crimes, while the DOJ and Aus figures on the number of victims. Because
<BR>
i'm limited to ascii, i can't do proper tables but in each of the
<BR>
following lines, the first number is for OZ, the second for USA (year
<BR>
taken in brackets):
<BR>
<P>Homicide (/100,000)  1.5 (1998)   6.3 (1998)
<BR>
Assault  (/100,000) 709  (1998)   365 (FBI)  3100 (DOJ) (1998)  (for
<BR>
FBI, aggravated assault only.  for DOJ, sum of simple and aggravated
<BR>
assault)
<BR>
Sexual Assault (/100,000)  78 (1998)   34 (FBI) 90 (DOJ) (1998)  (for FBI, rapes of females only)
<BR>
Armed Robbery (/100,000)   33 (1998)    100 (1998)
<BR>
Unarmed Robbery (/100,000)  63 (1998)    65 (1998)  (400 for DOJ combined
<BR>
armed and unarmed robbery)
<BR>
<P>With regards to guns, firearms were used in 19% of murders and attempted
<BR>
murders, and in 18% of armed robberies in Aus, while in the US, they were
<BR>
used in 65% of murders and 63% of armed robberies.  Another thing to note
<BR>
is that the US definition of aggravated assault includes the australian
<BR>
definition of attempted murder which were not included in the Australian
<BR>
assault figures (the attempted murder rate is 2/100,100 in Aus).
<BR>
<P>Even assuming only one victim/crime (reasonable for homicide but not for
<BR>
robbery IMHO), i think i'm much safer on this side of the pacific (well,
<BR>
especially in my age group (18-24), the homicide rate in the US is 18
<BR>
times higher than over here).  That said, i don't know how much longer it
<BR>
will be that way since the US stats seem to be getting much better by the
<BR>
year (rapes are at a historic low, most others are the lowest rates in 20
<BR>
years), while the Australian figures are mostly on the increase.
<BR>
<P>That's all for now.
