<EM>&gt; &gt; Now, would you like to explain exactly how your suggestion would result

<EM>&gt; &gt; in a successful resolution of the Irish problem? If you can convince us,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; then I suggest you will not find the Prime Minister and the Taioseach
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; uninterested. (They -- and their predecessors -- have been looking for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; solution for the past three decades, at great personal risk.) If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can't suggest a solution, may I submit that the smart thing to do would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be in future to do your research _before_ you open your mouth in public?

<EM>&gt; The unfortunate problem, Charlie, is that the northern group looks upon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself as 'english', not 'irish', so the solution is to get ALL of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'english' out of Ireland.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Again: it ain't as simple as that.
<BR>
<P>Remember why Ireland was partitioned in 1918 in the first place? It was
<BR>
meant to be a final solution to that problem -- move all the Protestants
<BR>
to the north, and all the Catholics to the south, put a wall between
<BR>
'em, and everyone's happy.
<BR>
<P>The North _was_ 80% protestant; now it's more like a 60/40 split, and
<BR>
both sides are getting itchy. Demographics put the boot in on the idea of
<BR>
a peaceful settlement. For decades the North was run on a cosy (for the
<BR>
Protestant majority) apartheid basis. Then the growing Catholic minority
<BR>
put an end to that. Add the fact that the South had (until relatively
<BR>
recently) a constitution containing a clause laying claim to the North,
<BR>
and was run along highly conservative Catholic religious lines, and you
<BR>
can see why the Protestants in the north weren't too enthusiastic about
<BR>
this -- although the violence of their response was utterly inexcusable.
<BR>
<P>As for the Orange orders identifying as British ... if you want to deny
<BR>
that they're Irish because they're descended from lowland  Scots settlers
<BR>
(note for by-standers: most of the 'English' settlers in Ireland were
<BR>
actually Scottish), then you're also going to have to admit that _you_
<BR>
are British! Those settlers landed in Ireland a full generation before
<BR>
the Mayflower set sail.
<BR>
<P>Hell, if the 'english' in Ireland aren't Irish, that makes me a Pole.
<BR>
No, scratch that: Poland is a new-fangled construction. I'm Russian!
<BR>
<P>Yours from Edinburgh, Scotland,
