<EM>&gt;Is it that simple?  I doubt that.  I believe people(atheists included) can

<P>Well, it may not be *quite* that simple.  But IMO there is certainly some 
<BR>
truth to what spike says.  I think that for the most part people spend too 
<BR>
much time seeking out the wisdom of other people in order to make themselves 
<BR>
happy.  Truth be told *you* know very little about what it takes to make 
<BR>
*me* happy.  The only place I can find the answer to that question is within 
<BR>
myself.  Sure it helps to listen to the experience of others and many times 
<BR>
the input of other people can steer you down a path you might not otherwise 
<BR>
have found, but ultimately it is up to you to decide whether or not that 
<BR>
path is satisfactory to you, and whether you should continue down it or not.
