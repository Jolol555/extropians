<P>
<EM>&gt; Why will you not concede the point: you may consider yourself an Extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you agree with the principles (and in my opinion follow them). You are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not an Extropian if you cannot do that.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a silly tautology: &quot;I define X as people who believe Y, so
<BR>
people who don't believe Y are not X&quot;.  So what?  The opposition
<BR>
isn't arguing that, though they might think they are.  What they're
<BR>
really arguing is one of (a) The use of words to identify things
<BR>
should be less rigorous than set theory in some contexts; (b) the
<BR>
set of people who believe Y really /ought/ to believe Y', so the word
<BR>
X should refer to Y'-believers as well; (c) while belief in Y is
<BR>
common among those calling themselves X, it's really a consequence
<BR>
of those people having condition Z (which may or may not include
<BR>
beliefs), so we ought to use X to refer to Z-people, most of whom
<BR>
also happen to believe in Y, but not necessarily; (d) Y itself is
<BR>
so imprecisely defined that some people we don't think are X might
<BR>
actually be X after all, because their vision of Y is clearer.
<BR>
<P>All of those are prefectly rational reasons for people to call
<BR>
themselves &quot;Extropian&quot; when they espouse beliefs that are apparently
<BR>
contrary to the principles.  Those people really ought to more
<BR>
clearly state which of the above (or some other one I might have
<BR>
missed) is the case, and argue for it more clearly, but we can't
<BR>
dismiss them with tautologies and bluster over definitions.
<BR>
