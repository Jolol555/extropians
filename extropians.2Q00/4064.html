At 2:46pm +1000 on 2000/05/30, Emlyn quoted:

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; Every Mother Theresa after the first (at any point, the &quot;marginal&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mother
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; Theresa) adds something (even if only a little) to society; a net
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefit.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Given Mother Theresa openly _professed_ views on human suffering -- about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; its necessity; i.e., the necessity of it in the form of the stifling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;poverty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; and rampant disease in Third World countries and not in the sense of, say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; needing a little adversity to make us stronger -- I'd think there's a high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; cost associated with even one Mother Theresa.  If ever there was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;character
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; that seems almost out of a Rand novel, it is her.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I think that Mother Teresa was a deeply unpleasant, immoral human
<BR>
being and I can think of no ways in which she added anything to the
<BR>
world, except perhaps as an example of what not to do, how *not* to
<BR>
live. I find it frightening that so many people -- even otherwise sane
<BR>
people -- think that she was a good person, or dare not say otherwise.
<BR>
There appears to be a taboo against speaking out against people like
<BR>
Mother Teresa. Perhaps it is the taboo against criticising religious
<BR>
ideas?
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>Delete now if you'll be offended by strong criticism of this &quot;saint&quot;.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P>Mother Teresa was a conservative Catholic who supported the evil
<BR>
Pope's hard line on abortion, contraception, divorce, women priests,
<BR>
and generally had very bad ideas about women. A woman's highest
<BR>
virtue was to do her duty to the church and her husband -- to be a
<BR>
&quot;good&quot; wife and mother and to serve the Catholic church.
<BR>
<P>She built up and ran an international corporation using slave
<BR>
labour. It was not slave labour in the *legal* sense, of course, but
<BR>
the psychological reality was precisely that of slave labour. She
<BR>
chose India as her base and got many young girls for her convents.
<BR>
Those young girls/women were not there voluntarily in the
<BR>
psychological sense, they were there because their parents put
<BR>
enormous psychological pressure on them to become nuns. Mother T had
<BR>
a hideously austere set of rules for them, summed up by chastity,
<BR>
obedience and suchlike, and that meant obedience to the church,
<BR>
i.e., her. (One wonders what happened when chastity and obedience
<BR>
came into conflict. I'll bet it was chastity that got sacrificed.)
<BR>
<P>She got off on playing the part of the ministering angel, and chose
<BR>
to save the souls of the lowest of the low -- the people who were
<BR>
dying. The problem is that she was not interested in *curing*
<BR>
anyone. An English nurse actually left after Mother Teresa had
<BR>
refused to help a child who would certainly have lived had he had a
<BR>
course of antibiotics. Her response was that it was irrelevant
<BR>
because he was going to meet God anyway! She wasn't interested in
<BR>
the living or potentially living, only the dying, and she was only
<BR>
interested in the dying for her own selfish pleasure in getting off
<BR>
on playing the ministering angel. She wasn't interested in helping
<BR>
them to get better, only to save their souls.
<BR>
<P>She betrayed the dying too. What she was doing was incompatible with
<BR>
having moral relationships with people. When you develop a
<BR>
relationship with someone, you thereby acquire an obligation to
<BR>
treat that person differently from how you might treat a complete
<BR>
stranger. A parent who has a child adopted at birth does not raise
<BR>
obligations to that child, but a parent who chooses to parent does
<BR>
thereby raise an obligation to the children she chooses to bring up.
<BR>
To the extent that Mother Teresa developed relationships with people
<BR>
in her care, she was acting immorally in not using the available
<BR>
money to treat them where that would have made a difference to
<BR>
whether they live or die, for example.
<BR>
<P>In her own case, when she got sick, she took herself straight to the
<BR>
best heart specialist in New York. There is nothing wrong with that!
<BR>
It was right for her to spend that money on curing herself, but it
<BR>
was wrong of her not to find a few dollars for a course of
<BR>
antibiotics to save a sick child with whom she had developed a
<BR>
relationship.
<BR>
<P>The logic of Mother Teresa's organisation was such as not to allow
<BR>
her to spend extra money on helping to cure anyone, let alone
<BR>
improve his or her life -- all she did was to minister to the dying.
<BR>
So Mother Teresa was giving the dying the impression that she cared
<BR>
but in fact she didn't. *Had* she cared, her whole organisation
<BR>
would have collapsed overnight, because when you care about someone,
<BR>
you want to save their lives if you can, even if that means spending
<BR>
less money on ministering to others (whom you do not know). When you
<BR>
have a relationship with someone, it is wrong to betray that person
<BR>
by sacrificing him or her to the idea of &quot;fairness&quot; or &quot;equality&quot;
<BR>
(as in &quot;everyone must suffer equally&quot; -- see my editorial in the
<BR>
journal Taking Children Seriously -- TCS 23, entitled &quot;Against
<BR>
Sharing Equally&quot;, also published by the Libertarian Alliance --
<BR>
Philosophical Notes 52, 1998, two pages, ISBN 1 85637 431 9). Doing
<BR>
the right thing for those with whom she had a relationship would
<BR>
have reduced the money for ministering to the others, and her whole
<BR>
agenda was to save souls, not help anyone improve their lives (or
<BR>
even live).
<BR>
<P>She could have had Munchhausen's Syndrome by Proxy or whatever it is
<BR>
called -- the thing where the person (nurse, etc) gives herself a
<BR>
role by making people die or nearly die, so she can then play the
<BR>
ministering angel. The only difference between this evil and that of
<BR>
Mother T is that she never had to take any murderous actions because
<BR>
there was a steady supply of dying people, it being Calcutta.
<BR>
<P>That's another thing -- why Calcutta? Why not somewhere even poorer?
<BR>
There are places in Africa that make Calcutta look like a rich
<BR>
place. So why didn't she want to be in *those* places?
<BR>
<P>So -- my main criticism is that all her relationships with those
<BR>
whose souls she saved, were immoral. She betrayed them. She also did
<BR>
everything she could to oppose the progress in terms of women's
<BR>
place in society.
<BR>
<P>She may be a saint (the Pope liked her anyway) but IMO she was evil.
