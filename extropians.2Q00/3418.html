<EM>&gt; Just because I cannot predict the outcome of an experiment, is a

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That I could not tell the difference AFTER the experiment is no

<EM>&gt; guarantee that it worked the way I would have liked.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not really an experiment if it gives you no information, is it?
<BR>
You know the outcome beforehand.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Like Mr Lorrey, I would like to believe in transporters, I'm just not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sure I can.
</EM><BR>
<P>How can you decide?
<BR>
<P>Suppose you lived in a world where everyone used them.  Would that make
<BR>
a difference?
<BR>
<P>Suppose you had somehow been coerced/tricked into using one some time in
<BR>
the past.  (By &quot;you&quot; I now mean the being who exited from that transporter
<BR>
and who has the memory of having gone through it.)  Would that make a
<BR>
difference?
