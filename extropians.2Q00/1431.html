John Grigg quotes Mike Darwin:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I looked on the Web just now and found a 1997 mortality table (or &quot;life 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; table&quot; as it's called. If you're interested, the URL was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.cd.gov/nds/data/lewk3_97.pdf">http://www.cd.gov/nds/data/lewk3_97.pdf</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe it pertains to the US only--a good enough start however). Starting 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with 100,000 people at birth (age 0), there were 96,330 surviving to age 39, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and 93,712 surviving to age 40. The fraction dying thus is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (96,330-93,712)/96,330 or 2.72% or about one in 37.
</EM><BR>
<P>The above URL didn't work; I tried changing cd.gov to cdc.gov but that
<BR>
didn't help.
<BR>
<P>The figures above are clearly wrong.  Look: we lost 3,670 people up to age
<BR>
39, and 6,288 by age 40?  Almost an additional 3000 between 39 and 40?
<BR>
That must have been a tough year.
<BR>
<P>I looked at <A HREF="http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/idbsprd">http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/idbsprd</A> and find the chance
<BR>
of dying in one year at around age 40 to be one in 155, rather than one
<BR>
in 37.  Still uncomfortably high, but not quite as bad.
<BR>
<P>Hal
