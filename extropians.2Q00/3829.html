<EM>&gt; Assuming that you can build hardware that somehow does discriminate

<EM>&gt; pitch as fast as we do, you have the latency issue that you are now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ready to start playing the note that the human audience has already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heard from the source (whistle, guitar-string or whatever) and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start late.  You just can't make this work in real time performance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situations, even if you can hide the original control signal from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; audience.  The control signal matched the timing of the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performers, but the resulting tone is unavoidably late.  Playing solo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't solve it either because what you are hearing is the note that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you were humming, played as trumpets, not the one that you are trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to hum right now.   The actual note-rate (tempo) that can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accomplished is really slow.

<P>Audio-to-pitch *is* effectively a solved problem.
<BR>
<P>Latency is not an issue and the amount of DSP required to do this well
<BR>
is dirt cheap.  For example, there exist cheap boxes that will do
<BR>
real-time pitch correction, a function which requires both detailed pitch
<BR>
discrimination *and* artifact-free signal re-synthesis.  One popular one,
<BR>
the Antares Autotune, has a latency of &lt;4ms, which is effectively
<BR>
instantaneous in audio terms (esp for live use).  In practice, solid
<BR>
implementations of these pitch discrimination/resynthesis algorithms are
<BR>
transparent and highly effective.
<BR>
<P>Fact is, the only parameter that needs to be manually adjusted on most of
<BR>
these types of boxes is the amount and nature of nuance you would like to
<BR>
keep in the signal (since most nuance is computationally indistinguishable
<BR>
from poor pitch control).  Setting these parameters to values that match
<BR>
the style of play reasonably well will produce the intended results. 
<BR>
(Setting these boxes to absurd slew rates is a popular vocal effect these
<BR>
days.)
