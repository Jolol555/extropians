<P>Oh, faaar too harsh on Roddenberry, Eliezer, waaay too negative.  Certainly
<BR>
<P>GR's work had its shortcomings, but recall he was writing for the
<BR>
television
<BR>
proletariat.  Furthermore, take a look at TV sci-fi of the late 60s.
<BR>
Terrible!
<BR>
Desolate wasteland!  Sci-fi was only a slight one-off from traditional
<BR>
horror
<BR>
flicks [Danger, Will Robinson!].
<BR>
<P>Roddenberry suggested a future in which humanity was working
<BR>
out problems, fixing things, overcoming.  Humans were not perfect
<BR>
by any means, and yes, one did wish Spock had strangled Kirk that
<BR>
time Spock got horny and challenged him to a dual.  And one wished
<BR>
that when Kirk was doing it with some green chick she would
<BR>
transmogrify into Q.  That'd fix him.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>But all in all, for 1967 it was one helllll of a cool series.  Homo Sapiens
<BR>
<P>grew into a really butt-kicking species, a meme that was amplified further
<BR>
in the Next Generation.  Roddenberry can be forgiven for a few kooky
<BR>
memes, such as smart people are unemotional, the theory of parallel
<BR>
evolution, playing fast and loose with the physics of spacetime, etc.
<BR>
It was *too* cool for its time, thus the early cancellation.   spike
