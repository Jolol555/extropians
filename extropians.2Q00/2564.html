<EM>&gt; Yes, of course, and I think he is aware of the particular foibles which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plague his opinions, if not empowered to change them. I am not sure that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand how his theories are weakened by his dad; Marxism has little to
</EM><BR>
do
<BR>
<EM>&gt; with the land snails, or slugs or whatever he studies. Whether I am on
</EM><BR>
THIS
<BR>
<EM>&gt; list or any other, regarding his politics: I have no problem with
</EM><BR>
tolerating
<BR>
<EM>&gt; other people's viewpoints, nor his Jewish/Atheist/Liberal persona.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The book I am speaking of is called &quot;The Mismeasure of Man' . It is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theoretical, or scientific... it's just a rare historical view,
</EM><BR>
documenting
<BR>
<EM>&gt; (somewhat humorously) various (at the time highly respectable, though now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laughable) scientific experiments in which race and genetics were analyzed
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; account for certain hegemonous nationalists to posit that they deserve a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; biologically &quot;superior&quot; intelligence over other races. Phrenology for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instance. It is amusing.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  His Marxist background does seem to inform a lot of his
<BR>
thinking.  E.g., he is generally against the notion of general
<BR>
intelligence -- the idea that there is some causal factor which some people
<BR>
might have that makes them more intelligent overall than others -- despite
<BR>
evidence that intelligence in one area often correlates with intelligence in
<BR>
others.  His bias against this seems to stem from his political views and
<BR>
not from a dispassionate examination of the evidence.  (Not that such an
<BR>
examination would make one a rabid proponent of general intelligence, but it
<BR>
might make one less extreme in opposition to it.:)  Why?  Economic
<BR>
egalitarianism sells better if there's no such thing as general
<BR>
intelligence.  Why?  One could make claim, as often is made, that one person
<BR>
is smart at one thing, while another smart at another, and so on, ergo,
<BR>
we're all equal.  But the truth (sad or no) seems to be some people are just
<BR>
smarter all around and some people are not so smart all around.  (I draw no
<BR>
political doctrine from this, but I do see it as not sitting well with
<BR>
people who want to base their ideology on psychology.)
<BR>
<P>As for his biological theories, I don't think all he says is hogwash, but I
<BR>
try to keep my errant meme detector on its highest setting when reading him.
<BR>
(But I always have it on.:)
<BR>
<P>But, in particular, the best thing to do with all stuff in this area is to
<BR>
try to look for transparency.  (Which is why I champion cladistics.:)
<BR>
Always ask:
<BR>
<P>1.  What does she or he mean?
<BR>
2.  Why would someone believe that? and
<BR>
3.  How does she or he back up his claim?
<BR>
<P>Don't fall prey to wit and cute little asides.  Granted, they do make
<BR>
reading more pleasurable, but they can also lull one into agreement merely
<BR>
because the author seems pleasant, witty, and an all around nice person.
<BR>
<P>My two cents!
