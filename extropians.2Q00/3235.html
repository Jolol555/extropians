<P>
I can't speak of suicide impulses in general, but I can tell you about my
<BR>
own experience:  the only time I ever seriously considered suicide was when
<BR>
I was 15 years old.  Going to highschool was a miserable hell for me, and I
<BR>
conculded that if there wasn't a good chance that life would get better than
<BR>
this, my most rational choice would be to kill myself.
<BR>
<P>I remember climbing up onto the roof of my parents' house and then up to the
<BR>
top of the chimney.  I wanted to be as far removed as possible from every
<BR>
day life as I thought things over.  I listed my options as I saw them:
<BR>
1.kill myself; 2. run away from home; 3. complete highschool with the
<BR>
expectation that things would be better once I got finished.  I eliminated
<BR>
option #2 based on my knowledge of the money-earning and food-gathering
<BR>
opportunities which existed for 15 year old kids in that time and place.  I
<BR>
eliminated option #1 because I didn't have complete data about option #3
<BR>
(although I'd read enough to have some idea of the breadth of opportunity
<BR>
out there in the world), and option #1 seemed fairly irrevocable.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to stay where I was for a while.  I probably was suffering from
<BR>
depression at the time; I spent much of my time drinking elixer of codeine,
<BR>
which in addition to the opiate, contained a high %age of ethanol.  Possibly
<BR>
the ability to tune out my surroundings through the aid of drugs helped me
<BR>
to survive a very unpleasant stage of my life.
<BR>
<P>As I've grown older I've learned to have more control over my environment
<BR>
through the use of my mind; as a result, I've come to take the various
<BR>
trials of the world less seriously than I once did.  No matter how certain I
<BR>
feel about this or that observation or theory I try to keep an open mind.
<BR>
<P>I first began to question the idea of certainty (no, that's a word of art in
<BR>
certain disciplines, isn't it?  maybe the term I want is...closed
<BR>
mindedness) when I read an article in Scientific American in, I believe,
<BR>
1974. The topic of the article was the unreliability of eye-witness
<BR>
testimony, and there was discussion of several experiments which indicated
<BR>
that, at least to some degree, people see what they believe in and expect to
<BR>
see.  When I write &quot;see&quot; I mean the interpretation of data which enter
<BR>
people's awareness, ostensibly through their sense organs.  In fact, the
<BR>
data pass through some powerful filters, although people are not generally
<BR>
aware of this.
<BR>
<P>Since then I've become convinced that people do indeed invent the universes
<BR>
they inhabit. The bearing this has on suicide is this:  there is no need to
<BR>
scrap the body in order to end suffering.  One can learn to slip into
<BR>
another and more pleasant universe.

Subject: Re: Suicide is Pointless
<BR>
<P>What is a suicidal impulse like.  Any random thoughts of death or suicide,
<BR>
have
<BR>
been quickly followed up with the thought, that it would not be good.  And I
<BR>
end
<BR>
up reaffirming my desire to live.
<BR>
<P>There have been a few times, that I have been in such pain, that I wished I
<BR>
would go crazy.  But I never wished to die.
