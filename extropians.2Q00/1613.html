<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The Unionists are Irish by your definition ... and non-native, by your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  previous definition. Which do you want to use?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Again, it's clearly a question of native by birth (in this case you can be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Native New Yorker and be Jamaican) or by heritage. I understand the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; difference, why would you pretend not to?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not &quot;pretending&quot; anything; I'm just highly pissed off with a common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; American reaction -- to blame one side for a civil war, when both sides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are pretty much evenly to blame (judging by the number of murders).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The hard men with the guns are all a bunch of bloodthirsty clowns, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we'd all be better off without them. But arguing that the problem is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;British imperialism&quot; is to reduce it to an absurd proposition. Sure,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the original invasion of Ireland in the 17th century was reprehensible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure, the actions of the settlers' descendants since then were also bad.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But pulling the British government out of the North right now isn't going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to fix that; it's just going to make the UVF start on a rampage of ethnic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cleansing, and make the pIRA or the cIRA or whatever they call themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this week retaliate in kind.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, we have a tradition of booting the British out here, so our
<BR>
sympathies tend to go to the 'underdogs'. After the rev war here, many tories
<BR>
stayed. Some got picked on, sure, while others hightailed it for Canada and then
<BR>
sicced their lawyers to try to regain the property they had abandoned (and when
<BR>
that didn't work, they instigated the War of 1812 (the 'British' troops were
<BR>
mostly Canadians)). You might call Canada the North American equivalent of
<BR>
Northern Ireland, and you've also got a put upon Catholic minority up there too.
<BR>
I'm sure Canadians just love the Ulster Unionists...
<BR>
<P>As for myself, a Catholic Scottish American whose family got relocated to Nova
<BR>
Scotia from the Gordon's Highlands, I've got little or no sympathies for the
<BR>
headaches the Protestant British have brought on themselves, while at the same
<BR>
time I have no sympathies for the marxist ideology of most IRA members. Frankly
<BR>
you deserve each other.
