Well Brian, I took a look at Fool.com, but I couldn't find the figures you
<BR>
mention in your post (11% average yield for over 75 years).  My suggestion
<BR>
to hold low-risk bonds to maturity and then reinvest, as opposed to
<BR>
investing in the stock market(including mutual funds) is based on my
<BR>
observations of my own and my clients' portfolios, and some research I did
<BR>
when I was at the University of Texas School of Business.  I used S&amp;P 500 as
<BR>
my data source, because they tracked the widest variety of stocks.  It's
<BR>
been a long time, and I don't remember the exact figures, but in general I
<BR>
don't think you can depend on stocks to do much better than break even at
<BR>
best after inflation is taken into account.  It's true that some people DO
<BR>
get rich in stocks.  Some people get rich from playing lotteries too. I
<BR>
know, I know, a lot of people have made money in the stock market lately,
<BR>
and I do try to keep an open mind.  Maybe I messed up when I was doing my
<BR>
research.  Maybe I tended to attract clients who were unusually bad at
<BR>
playing the stock market.  Maybe things have changed. But Fool.com has not
<BR>
convinced me that I'm wrong.

<P><P>Lets not confuse investing in real estate with investing. Despite
<BR>
13+ corrections of 30% or more and 35+ corrections of 10% or more
<BR>
the stock market has averaged an 11% average yield for over 75
<BR>
years.
