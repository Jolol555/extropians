<P>If only they would start knocking on our door. So far, we've sold direct 
<BR>
contact EMP devices for stopping car chases, and not many of those. We are 
<BR>
going to Maryland later this month to do testing for the National Institute 
<BR>
of Justice, but if last time's experience is any gauge, we won't get any 
<BR>
good results from even a glowing report. I think those people are only in 
<BR>
it for the paper they can waste.
<BR>
<P>HERF weapons are good against unhardened targets, as I pointed out before, 
<BR>
but it is not difficult to modify most equipment to resist easily generated 
<BR>
fields. Extreme fields, such as caused by nuclear detonations, are 
<BR>
definitely unhealthy for the operators of the device.
<BR>
<P>I think this line of attack will become obsolete fairly quickly as a useful 
<BR>
means of disabling electronic equipment. It will be another arms race 
<BR>
between better filtering and shielding and the ultimate power levels that 
<BR>
can be directed without killing people in the general area.
<BR>
<P>If you don't care about collateral damage and injury, a way around this 
<BR>
problem might be particle beam weapons. Secondary radiation caused by a 
<BR>
beam hitting shielding can destroy the electronics as thoroughly as HERF 
<BR>
can an unshielded device. Again, this technology needs a large amount of 
<BR>
R+D before even a cobbled-up test device could be fielded.
<BR>
<P>I find it hard to conceive of any energy weapon being able to compete with 
<BR>
the simple transfer of mechanical kinetic energy of a projectile or an 
<BR>
explosive, at least until nanoweapons are easily possible.
