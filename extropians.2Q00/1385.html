Bottom line is I think it comes down to the fact that the reason we want to 
<BR>
live forever is that we realize there is a *lot* left to life that we have 
<BR>
not experienced and cannot possibly experience in a mere hundred years or 
<BR>
so.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I agree.  I remember being a young boy reading a child's Bible and thinking 
<BR>
how disappointing it was that people no longer had five-hundred year 
<BR>
lifespans!  I shared this thought with my mother and she agreed.
<BR>
<P>Zero, have you read Robert Ettinger's books _The Prospects of Immortality_ 
<BR>
and _Man into Superman_ yet?  He goes into imaginative detail about what one 
<BR>
could do with indefinite lifespan.  Maybe a little dated, but still fun 
<BR>
reads.
<BR>
<P>Mere vastly extended lifespan in my current state would be frustrating.  I 
<BR>
want it with an enhanced mind (eighty more IQ points and a photographic 
<BR>
memory) so I can really perceive and control the world around me so much the 
<BR>
better.Control is a nice thing, I know from having suffered a lack of it at 
<BR>
times.  Of course, by then there will be many who will have left me &quot;in the 
<BR>
dust.&quot;

might be boxed into either. :)
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>My own musical tastes do range all over the place.  I am somewhat partial to 
<BR>
the 'classic rock' of the eighties which I listened to as a teenager.  I am 
<BR>
feeling old!  While in college I met a nineteen year-old girl who I became 
<BR>
friends with.  She sized people up by asking to know their favorite music.  
<BR>
I could not really think of a band until one of my favorites popped into my 
<BR>
head.  When I said &quot;Hall &amp; Oates&quot; she acted revolted and I could tell we had 
<BR>
no future together!  I do love a couple of their songs though.
<BR>
<P>As for clothes, I am a bit of a nerd.  I see them as being 'utilitarian' and 
<BR>
I don't like spending too much money on them.  This is so opposite of most 
<BR>
people.  I am still kind of embarrassed of my skinny frame and so try to 
<BR>
dress to cover it up.  I cringe at the prices I see for clothes while at 
<BR>
work which people not so willingly pay!  I do like to get &quot;all gussied up&quot; 
<BR>
and wear a suit once in a while.

So I can't claim any particular pigeon holes. My pigeon hole would have to 
<BR>
be the set of all pigeon holes (although admittedly I haven't gotten around 
<BR>
to even a small fraction of them yet, but I'm working on it).-
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Instead of 'pigeon holes' why not use the term 'facets or roles that we use 
<BR>
in our life.'lol
<BR>
<P>My own pigeon holes are
<BR>
1.  Fred Meyer employee
<BR>
2.  On again/off again college student
<BR>
3.  Mormon church member
<BR>
4.  cryonicist/quasi-extropian
<BR>
5.  Outdoorsman-not as adept as I should be though
<BR>
<P>And I have probably missed some too.  How some of these interact can be 
<BR>
interesting and at other times painful.  I remember somehow getting into a 
<BR>
conversation about nanotechnology in my job interview with the Fred Meyer 
<BR>
deputy store director who hired me.  He was totally fascinated! lol  I never 
<BR>
did say, &quot;sir, in about three decades you will be out of a job!&quot;  Of course, 
<BR>
by then everything on the shelves may just be for display and you will have 
<BR>
to find an employee to say &quot;pardon, could you replicate for me one of your 
<BR>
barbecue grills?&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
