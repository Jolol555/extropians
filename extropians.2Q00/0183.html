<P>
Notwithstanding their apparent dispute about the meaning of the 9th 
<BR>
Amendment, I will happily agree with both Mike and Greg.
<BR>
<P>The former, I think, correctly finds in the 9th Amendment a neat 
<BR>
encapsulation, now too seldom appreciated, of the Founders' appreciation for 
<BR>
natural rights.  A large and growing body of scholarship--see, e.g., several 
<BR>
of Randy Barnett's writings--confirms that the Founders' meant for the 9th to 
<BR>
sharply limit government power and to preserve our rights to person and 
<BR>
property.  That said, I must say that I do not necessarily agree that the 9th 
<BR>
covers privacy rights writ large.  Rather, it protects citizens against 
<BR>
privacy-invading trespasses to person and property committed by agents of the 
<BR>
State.  The Ninth by no means forbids, say, private databases of shopping 
<BR>
behavior.

<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; But only in that most courts today seem to have total ignorance or

<EM>&gt;  &gt;  distain for the 9th Amendment, and are drifting away from the founders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;  concepts of Natural Law. Under the 9th, any rights not enumerated in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;  Constitution are retained by the people, as individuals, so it follows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;  that since privacy is not explicitly mentioned, it is a 9th Amendment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;  right.

<P><EM>&gt;  I don't read the IXth ammendment this way.  The text says:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;            The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;            shall not be construed to deny or disparage others 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;            retained by the people. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I'm no constitutional law scholar, but this just seems to say &quot;The fact 
</EM><BR>
that 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  a subject is addressed in the Constitution doesn't mean that it excludes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  other rights the people may have,&quot; or alternatively, &quot;the Constitution is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  not an exhaustive enumeration of rights.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Since I don't see what Greg disputes in Mike's interpretation, I'm willing to 
<BR>
go along with his paraphrasing.  Now, if like some jurisprudes, Greg intends 
<BR>
to claim the 9th does not cover *individual* rights, I'll have a bone to 
<BR>
pick.  Ditto if he thinks that the Founders did not have natural rights in 
<BR>
mind; scholarship has quite firmly established that matter, in my opinion.
