Dolly Parton-what a breath of fresh air!  It's pleasantly ironic to know she
<BR>
has &quot;transhuman&quot; qualities-if not by the various augmentations,
<BR>
modifications and upgrading of her human form, than certainly in her humor:
<BR>
<P>Hosting last night's Academy of Country Music Awards by commented about
<BR>
herself (s):
<BR>
<P>&quot;We're both 35 years old. Well, parts of me are anyway,&quot; she said at last
<BR>
night's televised Academy of Country Music Awards.  Which parts?  She later
<BR>
cracked that she would never &quot;graduate from collagen.&quot; (Although it's fully
<BR>
known that she most assuredly graduated at the top 1% from the Academy of
<BR>
Business Moguls.)
<BR>
<P>Now, Country &amp; Western music isn't my favorite beat-it's techno and blues
<BR>
that stir my fire, but the shear beauty of  Shania Twain is spellbinding and
<BR>
so is the crafty way she crossed over into pop/rock; not to mention and
<BR>
Dolly Parton's song &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; which is utterly moving while
<BR>
sung by Whitney Houston or Parton.  I like the down-home manner of some of
<BR>
Country's folk and it is a welcomed contrast to some of Rap's monotone
<BR>
blanderings and full-sized gyrating asses ensconcing the camera's
<BR>
viewfinder.
<BR>
<P>I enjoy at least a few riffs from just about every sound.  But what I enjoy
<BR>
the most, at least at this moment, is the melodious laughter that pours out
<BR>
of me when I experiences a sense of humor in the midst of our transhuman
<BR>
mutation-whichever part.
<BR>
