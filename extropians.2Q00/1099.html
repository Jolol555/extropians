</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  The average high school graduate in 1920 was more literate than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  typical college graduate today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's why the appeal of the Harry Brown book TOTALLY lost me ... hearken to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a better life back then... How good life was before it all got interfered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with by those darn civl rights laws. Hogwash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; People are always going to whitewash the past. Remember how much better is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was ...? ... back in another time, a better, simpler America?  That rhetoric
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only works if I lived in middle class, non-ethnic, as white male America,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike.  Things weren't so good for &quot;others&quot;.  Others have it better now, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not much -- oh yes, and at a cost to the middle class non-ethnic, white male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; America.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know you have heard this before and discount it, but it's my POV.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't dispute that the non-high school graduates had it difficult, esp
<BR>
minorities. I was commenting on how gicing the state (and therefore the
<BR>
eductation monopoly union, the NEA) control of our schools has produces
<BR>
a far lower quality product.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (snip)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the lesser of two evils. By aborting, shes making sure there are fewer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  people like her (and the father) in the world. Abortion and execution: I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  just call it evolution in action.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is a rational point of view. Cold hearted, a little stubbornly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impersonal, but rational. Actually I can add on to that. An accidental mother
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who is not &quot;unfit&quot; can also observe the world as an &quot;unfit&quot; and not want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; raise a baby here. Is that anti-evolutionary?
</EM><BR>
<P>I very much dislike having to think that way, beleive me. And your axiom
<BR>
is also valid, however it is still part of what I say in an extropian
<BR>
sense: anyone that is that pessimistic about the future, and feels like
<BR>
one person has no ability to change it, is helping create a better
<BR>
future by not bringing one more pessimistic cynical person into the
<BR>
world.
<BR>
<P>I don't, however, feel cold hearted about execution. Anyone who has
<BR>
demonstrated no respect for their fellow man is no longer human.

<EM>&gt; PS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I Really liked you answer to my art post, and will write a reply as soon as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have time to honor it in the way it deserves to be honored.
</EM><BR>
<P>I look forward to it. ;)
