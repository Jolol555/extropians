<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Uh-huh. Then the EU anti-trust investigation into Microsoft must be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; imaginary, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Microsoft's european operations can probably be investigated, but the EU has no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; extraterritorial authority, esp re a US corp. They can certainly regulate MS's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; business practices in europe if they so choose, but they certainly cannot impose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any remedies upon MS corporation proper.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes it can. If Microsoft wants to trade in Europe it must abide by EU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laws. Don't want to obey the law? Take the penalty, or get out. Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has lots of employees based in Europe, and they're sure as hell vulnerable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to this sort of thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft _can_ side-step an EU anti-trust investigation -- all they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do is stop selling Windows anywhere in the EU, at which point they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't a monopoly any more. If they _want_ to sell Windows in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment ...
</EM><BR>
<P>So if MS only sells to the euro market via internet downloads.... what possible
<BR>
actions can the eu countries take?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (Oh, and then there's the French investigation. _That_ one is dynamite --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the charges are extremely serious and typically carry prison sentences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; for the directors of companies found guilty under them, because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; French charges aren't about anti-trust -- they're anti-FRAUD, and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; allege that Microsoft defrauded the French government. Oops ...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Extra-territoriality again. They gonna send the Foreign Legion into the US to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; arrest Bill Gates?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Quite possibly, knowing the French ... but remember, Microsoft is behaving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extra-territorially. In the event, I expect they'll just lock up the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directors of Microsoft's French subsidiary, and/or fine the company, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe put out an extradition warrant for Bill.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not the worlds biggest fan of Bill Gates, but even I can tell you that if the
<BR>
French try something like this, its gonna piss off a lot of Americans. You guys think
<BR>
the Banana War got nasty? Y'ain't seen NUTHIN' yet. Expect things like french wines
<BR>
getting smashed on the docks, cheeses getting tossed into Elliott Bay... a whole
<BR>
Seattle Frog Festival to mirror the Boston Tea Party...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Microsoft occupies a similar monopoly position in the rest of the world,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; if not a tighter one -- and typically charges more for its software.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hardly. China, for example, the communist party bosses who have been pirating so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; much MS software control a greater monopoly position in the chinese software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; market than MS does. Just because the market uses MS software that is pirated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doesn't mean you can say MS monopolizes the market.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rest of world != China. Plus, they hardly have a monopoly on it -- they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merely steal the most of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I merely used them as an example, as I had hoped you could comprehend by the simple
<BR>
English. Any higher rates for software elsewhere in the world are because of the
<BR>
following:
<BR>
a) added cost of language customization
<BR>
b) added cost of piracy in that market
<BR>
c) import tariffs by the importing country
<BR>
d) value added taxes on distribution in those countries.
