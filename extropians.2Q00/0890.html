-better than the rest of the suckers. Then, when the pyramid starts quaking,

they see that there's another one to jump to that's still going up. But they

quickly drive that one to the limit as well, so they then jump back to get

<P>Eliezer, I have a song to share with you and the rest of the people here, 
<BR>
that addresses these very issues.  I thought you might get a kick out of it.
<BR>
<P>Look for the full studio version of the song &quot;There's gonna be a reckoning&quot;

<P>Also, I have a repost from the Cryonet by John de Rivaz, who is an

englishman with some perceptive views on what is going on right now in Wall

Street and how the U.S. tax code is threatening the financial viability of 
<BR>
entrepreneurialism and profit-making.

Subject: A note on the falling stock market
<BR>
Date: Sat, 15 Apr 2000 16:12:56 +0100
<BR>
<P>Investors who read cryonet will hardly fail to have noticed that tech stocks 
<BR>
have taken a tumble over the past couple of weeks. However be aware that a 
<BR>
bear trap is developing, according to a leading investment newsletter. Intel 
<BR>
are set to release better than expected results on Tuesday, and Microsoft's 
<BR>
*trading* results (as opposed to Gates' tiffs with the lawyers) on Thursday 
<BR>
are likely to be up-beat. The fall of stock quotations will make no change 
<BR>
to the flow of news from the bio-technology sector, much of which will seem 
<BR>
like sci-fi or magic to people who have not been following events closely.
<BR>
<P>However I hope that quotations will not shoot up with unrealistic speed, but 
<BR>
rise gradually as the news comes in over the next few months. But if they do 
<BR>
go up and down like a yo-yo you can either be a bookmaker and sit back watch 
<BR>
your stocks go up and down but with an upward bias, and let the punters take 
<BR>
the losses, or you can be a punter and try and beat the markets, selling on 
<BR>
highs and buying back on lows. As with gambling, *some* punters will make a 
<BR>
lot of money, but most will lose. Unlike gambling, the tax authorities will 
<BR>
also
<BR>
take a lot of money from the punters. Even those who lose in the end will 
<BR>
have years where they make money, and their portfolios will be raped of 
<BR>
these gains by gains taxes.
<BR>
<P>According to Lord Rees-Mogg in The Sovereign Individual, the US has one of 
<BR>
the most savage tax regimes in the world.
<BR>
<P>Rees-Mogg and James Davidson write:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;The Drawback of Nationality Taxation
</EM><BR>
Unless there is an astonishing and almost miraculous change in policies, the 
<BR>
successful investor or entrepreneur in the Information Age will pay a 
<BR>
lifetime penalty of tens of millions, hundreds of millions, or even billions 
<BR>
of dollars to reside in the countries with fiscal policies like those that 
<BR>
have enjoyed the highest living standards during the twentieth century. 
<BR>
Absent a radical change, the  penalty will be highest for Americans. The 
<BR>
United States is one of just three jurisdictions on the planet that impose 
<BR>
taxes based upon nationality rather than residence.
<BR>
<P>The other two are the Philippines, a former U.S. colony, and Eritrea, one of 
<BR>
whose exiled leaders fell under the spell of the IRS during its long 
<BR>
rebellion against Ethiopian rule. Eritrea now imposes a nationality tax of 3 
<BR>
percent. While that is a pale imitation of the U.S. rates, even that burden 
<BR>
makes Eritrean citizenship a liability in the Information Age, current law 
<BR>
makes U.S. citizenship even a larger liability. The IRS has become one of 
<BR>
America's leading exports. More than any other country, the United States 
<BR>
reaches to the corners of the earth to extract income from its nationals.
<BR>
<P>If a 747 jetliner filled with one investor from each jurisdiction on earth 
<BR>
touched down in a newly independent country and each investor risked $1,000 
<BR>
in a start-up venture in the new economy the American would face a far 
<BR>
higher tax than anyone else on any gains. Special, penal taxation of foreign 
<BR>
investment, exemplified by the so-called PFIC taxation, plus the US 
<BR>
nationality tax, can result in tax liabilities of 200% or more on long-term 
<BR>
assets held outside the United States. A successful American could reduce 
<BR>
his total lifetime tax burden as a citizen of any of more than 280 other 
<BR>
jurisdictions on the globe.
<BR>
<P>The United States has the globe's most predatory soak-the-rich tax system. 
<BR>
Americans living in the United States or abroad are treated more like assets 
<BR>
and less like customers than citizens of any other country. The American tax 
<BR>
regime is therefore more anachronistic and less competitive with success in 
<BR>
the Information Age than those of even the notoriously high tax welfare 
<BR>
states of Scandinavia. Citizens of Denmark or Sweden face few legal 
<BR>
obstacles in realising their growing technological autonomy as individuals.
<BR>
<P>Should they wish to negotiate their own tax rates, they are free to elect to 
<BR>
(move and) pay taxes in Switzerland by private treaty, or move to Bermuda 
<BR>
and pay no income taxes at all. A Swede or a Dane who wishes to pay high 
<BR>
taxes because he believes the welfare slate is worth what it costs is 
<BR>
actually making a choice. He can elect to be taxed at any rate that prevails 
<BR>
in any other jurisdiction in the civilised or uncivilised world. To change 
<BR>
his tax rate, he need only(?) move. Technology makes such a choice easier by 
<BR>
the
<BR>
moment. Yet that option is denied to Americans.
<BR>
<P>Holding a U.S. passport is destined to become a major drawback to realising 
<BR>
the opportunities for individual autonomy made possible by the Information 
<BR>
Revolution. Being born an American during the industrial period was a lucky 
<BR>
accident.
<BR>
<P>Even in the early stages of the Information Age, it has become a 
<BR>
multimillion dollar liability.
<BR>
To see how great a liability, consider this comparison. Under reasonable 
<BR>
assumptions, a New Zealander with the same pre-tax performance as the 
<BR>
average of the top 1 percent of American taxpayers would pay so much less in 
<BR>
taxes that the compounding of his tax savings alone would make him richer 
<BR>
than the American would ever be.
<BR>
<P>At the end of a lifetime, the New Zealander would have $73 million more to 
<BR>
leave to his children or grandchildren. (or spend
<BR>
on the cryopreservation of himself and his friends and family) And New
<BR>
Zealand is not even a recognised tax haven. More than forty other
<BR>
jurisdictions impose lower income and capital taxation than New Zealand.
<BR>
<P>If our argument is right, the number of low-tax jurisdictions is likely to 
<BR>
rise rather than fall. All of them will provide an advantage as a domicile 
<BR>
over the United States, worth tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, 
<BR>
over a lifetime.
<BR>
<P>Unless U.S. taxes are reformed to become more competitive with
<BR>
those of other jurisdictions, and are no longer levied on the basis of
<BR>
nationality, thinking persons will renounce U.S. citizenship, 
<BR>
notwithstanding the obstacles imposed by Clinton's exit tax.&lt;&lt;
