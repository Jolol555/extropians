<EM>&gt; &gt;I wonder what would happen if you organized a &quot;party/poster&quot; conference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;by just having a very large room with dozens of whiteboards, and with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;snacks and chairs distributed throughout.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Many years ago, in the days of Xanadu, there were parties at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Big House&quot; (Mark Miller, Terry Stanley, Dean Tribble). You remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the walls in the front rooms that were covered by white boards.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Always the white boards were filled, and I remember folks talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and sketching many things during those big parties. I loved those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parties, there was a lot of spontaneous activity around, great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conversations. Perhaps the &quot;brainstorming&quot; was particularly good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because the atmosphere was charged.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm not sure that one can &quot;plan&quot; a brainstorming session with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;party. My opinion is that the focus is best placed on the party,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the other &quot;devices&quot; (white boards, etc) available to those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that want it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, those sort of parties are likely influencing me here.
<BR>
<P>There are some things you can plan.  You can plan who to invite,
<BR>
how long it will last, and whether there is a &quot;theme.&quot;  So I
<BR>
wonder what happens if you invite the same sort of people you
<BR>
would to a conference, have it at the same sort of place and
<BR>
lasting the same sort of time (several days), and have a similarly
<BR>
specific theme topic, but actually organized it more like a party,
<BR>
which is to say you don't actually organize that much.
