<EM>&gt; &gt;  Why?  What would make one qualified in this area?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Does QueeneMUSE know Rand's definition of art?  Or why she takes a
</EM><BR>
stand
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  against Modern Art?  (I should mention, not all Objectivists and fellow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  travelers agree with Rand's stance here.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I have read all of her work, a guy I dated for a short time had this
</EM><BR>
big
<BR>
<EM>&gt; thing for her. Since I am open minded, i did the reasearch. I read it
</EM><BR>
all --
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and with the exception of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; which is a very well written
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; novel, I found her work most clumsy and intolerant. When I think of her I
</EM><BR>
am
<BR>
<EM>&gt; struck with an image of a bitter, psthologically stricken person who
</EM><BR>
survived
<BR>
<EM>&gt; traumatic injuries in her homeland and came here to work through her
</EM><BR>
psychic
<BR>
<EM>&gt; wounds by outpouring onto paper. What she promotes is largely distrust,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dislike, disdain, contempt, scorn, and loathing. For meny many things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is not my style of thought, I am a person who loves.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do think Rand was arrogant, though I do not know how much of this was a
<BR>
result of her growing up in the Soviet Union.  No doubt, the ideas in the
<BR>
air at that time to leave a lasting mark on her -- as Chris Sciabarra
<BR>
demonstrates in his _Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical_ -- but I'm not sure if
<BR>
we can correlate her bad personality traits merely with this formative
<BR>
period.  To me, that's like giving someone a free pass because blaming a bad
<BR>
childhood for everything wrong with his life.
<BR>
<P>Also, I do NOT agree that what &quot;she promotes is largely distrust, dislike,
<BR>
disdain, contempt, scorn, and loathing&quot; or that her purely bad traits always
<BR>
dominated in her writing.  I find her writings, fiction or nonfiction, to
<BR>
generally have a surface level Manicheanism -- i.e., painting everything in
<BR>
terms of Good vs. Evil.  However, if one reads more closely, one finds an
<BR>
active mind grasping for truth.  Her delivery, which is strident, marrs
<BR>
that, especially if one is used to the notion of the truth seeker as
<BR>
humble...
<BR>
<P>In a sense, this is just the sort of notion she was trying to tap with her
<BR>
hammer to show it was hollow.  Perhaps it would be more accurate to say not
<BR>
that Rand was always bitter, mean-spirited, or whatever trait you find
<BR>
disagreeable, but that she was almost always confrontational.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, my interest is more in her ideas themselves, especially insofar as
<BR>
they are valid or lead to interesting conclusions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; She often refured things she had no knowledge of, if it infringed on her
</EM><BR>
own
<BR>
<EM>&gt; whims, even to the point where she wrote contradicting tracts on the
</EM><BR>
effects
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of cigarettes, proclaiming the medical community wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree in the case of cigarettes -- as would most Objectivists.  I think
<BR>
what Rand needed, in many cases, was someone to tell, &quot;Look, you're smart.
<BR>
You might have figured out a lot of things.  You write bestselling novels.
<BR>
But you do NOT know everything.&quot;  But this is something a lot of people need
<BR>
reminding of, including, sad to say, me.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Her attitude toward art was boorish, uneducated, closed minded and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out-of-touch.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't agree with this.  I think sometimes she could hold onto a bad idea
<BR>
too tightly, as with the cigarette thing or her view of femininity
<BR>
(especially in regards to whether a woman should ever be President).  (On
<BR>
the latter, I wonder why no one ever called her on the carpet regarding her
<BR>
rather ambiguous view of sexuality, though a recent book _Feminist
<BR>
Interpretations of Ayn Rand_, edited by Mimi Reisel Gladstein and Sciabarra,
<BR>
does just this.  Also, there's an email discussion list devoted to
<BR>
Randian-Feminism (see <A HREF="http://www.math.uio.no/~thomas/lists/lists.html">http://www.math.uio.no/~thomas/lists/lists.html</A>).)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Her ideals were as square as you can get. Unhip, uncool, out of it..  very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; germanic/idealistic/super-uber-stiffo.
</EM><BR>
<P>To some extent I agree.  As a person who moves in Objectivist circles --
<BR>
maybe too much -- I've noticed a conservative streak in the movement.  This
<BR>
is changing.  Regardless, it is, I believe, at odds with the actual ideals
<BR>
projected in her novels.  I certainly don't see her heroes and heroines as
<BR>
farty conservatives or stiff.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At a secular humanist meeting an old guy called her an intellectual bimbo.
</EM><BR>
<P>Excellent analysis!  It's great to dismiss someone with wit if without
<BR>
understanding.  (Truth be told, I don't know if this &quot;old guy&quot; knew what he
<BR>
was talking about, so my comeback here is as empty as his attack.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When it came to modern art, she had no talent herself,
</EM><BR>
<P>What does this mean?  Does one have to be a Modern artist to critique Modern
<BR>
Art?  This would be akin to saying only chefs can send the meal back.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;nor an art education.
</EM><BR>
<P>Isn't this merely a call for credentials?  Does anyone think she was
<BR>
unacquainted with works of Modern Art?  Or is QueeneMUSE demanding someone
<BR>
have an art degree from a prestigious school before opening one's mouth or
<BR>
putting pen to paper?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yet she felt utterly qualified to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vilify with great passion, the greatest names of the day, simply because
</EM><BR>
her
<BR>
<EM>&gt; understandin gof it was limited. She trashed a whole genre simply because
</EM><BR>
she
<BR>
<EM>&gt; couldn't see the vlaue of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>While I do think she went too far, her reasons for dissing Modern Art were
<BR>
not that.  What she though about it was not that it lacked value but that it
<BR>
actively promoted the destruction of values.  This is the difference between
<BR>
seeing something as worthless or useless -- for her theory of art posits art
<BR>
as a having a role to play in life other than idle entertainment -- to
<BR>
seeing it as harmful.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Her entire outlook was sneering, venomous, self-important and smug. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead of spending so much time on self absorbtion she had gone to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trouble to educate herself on the current artscene, I'd have had more
</EM><BR>
respect.
<BR>
<P>What would have educated her in this regard?  I have a feeling that only
<BR>
adulation and praise would qualify for QueeneMUSE as education.  Prove me
<BR>
wrong!  Please prove me wrong.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
