<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  Though I agree GNR will help make CAtS better, if we just took that old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  Saturn V design, which, if I'm right, is now unpatented, we could be making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  disposable launch vehicles that could put huge cargoes in orbit NOW!  We'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  be using a proven technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ja, however we dont have that design any more.  It is folklore in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space industry which I have been trying to confirm or overturn for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years.  According to the legend, after the end of the Saturn V production
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run, the drawing package was not only not preserved, it was intentionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destroyed, so we couldn't build one now even if we wanted to.  A reliable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source has told me that at least part of the package still exists in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; archives at Johnson, but he could not confirm that it was all there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another source claims that the drawing package was not fully up to date
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever; that skilled craftsmen knew how to make certain parts and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these tricks were never entered into the drawings back in the go-go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rush of the 1960s, altho this latter part strains the imagination.  That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sure wouldnt fly today.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've found that while the device drawings would be to spec and as made,
<BR>
its the manufacturing drawings that would frequently not be updated with
<BR>
the little quirks and workarounds that people on the manufacturing floor
<BR>
come up with to either do their jobs better, faster, or to work around a
<BR>
manufacturing defect that was not forseen in 2d drawings. Till my father
<BR>
came to work at Ruger, engineering by word of mouth on the manufacturing
<BR>
floor, without documentation, tended to be the regular MO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The conspiracy theorist hold that the Saturn V drawings were destroyed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in order to prevent the Saturn V from being considered a competitor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the space shuttle.
</EM><BR>
<P>This argument has been made by Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven. I've
<BR>
also heard that the drawings were destroyed because the Administration
<BR>
was afraid of, or had been told by, the Russians that they were going to
<BR>
claim that the Saturn V was to be regarded as another ICBM design.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect a more likely explanation is that no one awarded a contract
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to preserve the drawings and so North American Rockwell, et. al. didnt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anybody know?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>The only engineering departments I have dealt with were rather small to
<BR>
middlin, so I can't presume to understand the scope of storing the
<BR>
engineering drawings for the most complex machine ever built to that
<BR>
date, however I don't know of any engineers that would not keep archives
<BR>
of all of their prior work, even if just on microfilm, although I
<BR>
understand that Lockheed used to regularly destroy many drawings of
<BR>
classified programs as a security measure, which perplexed the USAF to
<BR>
no end.
