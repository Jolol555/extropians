<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; If we know that some particular set of neurons performs a certain function,

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and we know we can duplicate said function with X MFLOPS, we have an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; accurate estimate of the computational demands of replacing said neurons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Period.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Huh? Now you are making no sense at all.  What &quot;If&quot;?? That's the whole point,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no one has yet been able to duplicate any said function.  You're caught in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some weird self referential tautology!  You might want to clear your head
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and start reading this discussion from the beginning since the crux of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; argument has obviously lost you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As Anders' pointed out, the degree of &quot;accuracy&quot; you get depends on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hardware and software you have available and how many &quot;compromises&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you have to make to get the results in something less than a month.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are satisfied that the abstractions in your model are sufficently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accurate or spend the time to develop very specialized hardware then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can run things much faster.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So far both Robin Hanson and Anders Sandberg admit that a single transistor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; isn't going to do the job.  That much we all agree on.  What exactly are you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; arguing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True, because a single transistor is designed as a switch, while a neuron
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a multiply-adder.  So what you really need is arrays of DSP chips.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These have been built, I believe Columbia has one that is pretty large.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But even the largest (10K+ DSP chips?) are still small compared with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the number of neurons (billions).  They compensate for this by being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhat faster (millions/sec vs. 100s-1000s/sec).  In terms of #'s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of transistors you can probably do this with 1K to 100K transistors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depending on how many &quot;bits&quot; of accuracy you need (neurons are probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than 1-bit devices but probably much less than 16-bit devices).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *However*, neurons may be relatively &quot;fuzzy&quot; devices, meaning they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be more effectively implemented using analog rather than digital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; logic.  I think the transistor count drops by 1-2 orders of magnitude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when you implement multiply-adders in analog rather than digital logic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The real issue that I believe is being &quot;poked&quot; at here is whether or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not various brain functions are well enough understood that you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implement hardware+software that produces the function for fewer &quot;IPs&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than the brain.  I'd say there are a whole *host* of things: arithmetic,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; symbolic logic (to a degree), sorting, spell-checking, language
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recognition, language translation (coming slowly), message passing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and routing, character &quot;recognition&quot;, limited reading (OCR), most game
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; playing (the only exception left is Go), driving automobiles,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complex simulations or phenomena from quantum mechanics to weather,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are among those &quot;brain functions&quot; where software and hardware have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trumped the brain completely.  The areas we have to wrestle with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now are pattern recognition, common sense knowledge bases, language
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;comprehension&quot; and a few more.
</EM><BR>
<P>Somewhere along the line the point of my argument has been lost, since I have always
<BR>
agreed with everything you said above. I am not disputing that we will eventually be
<BR>
able to *compress* various functions of the brain and neurons such that we can
<BR>
reduce the overall number of flops required to simulate them.  What I am saying is
<BR>
that Hans Moravec in both books I've read, never considers that there is any
<BR>
computation aking place within the neuron itself - which is an amazing oversight if
<BR>
you ask me.  Drugs effects on the receptor sites alone proves this in abundance.
<BR>
So, my post began with a question asking how much computational power is involved
<BR>
within the neuron?  I leave it up to the more knowledgeable people on this list to
<BR>
determine what that is, and hopefully find a way to reduce the number of flops
<BR>
required for future simulations.  Billy Brown was arguing about carrots while I've
<BR>
been pressing the point home about apples!  :-)
