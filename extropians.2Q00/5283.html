<P>
I can't claim to have visited many 3rd world countries, but I've spent some
<BR>
time in Mexico. I've noticed 2 major causes of poverty there.  One is the
<BR>
Catholic church which discourages the use of contraceptives and abortion.
<BR>
The second is the behavior of people who hold positions of power in various
<BR>
governmental and corporate entities.
<BR>
<P>When you buy bananas at the grocery store, odds are they came from land that
<BR>
was once occupied by people who grew enough food, fiber, and fuel crops on
<BR>
the land to take care of themselves.  Business corporations, acting in
<BR>
conjunction with the Mexican (and sometimes the U.S.) government, took over
<BR>
the land and gave the people who'd been using it the option of leaving or
<BR>
staying there and working for the corporation at very low wages, which they
<BR>
would use to buy exorbitantly priced food at the grocery store (likely also
<BR>
owned by the corporation). The more self-respecting of the disposssed
<BR>
peasants go to seek their fortunes in the city.  The lucky ones have friends
<BR>
in the U.S. who can help them find work (if they can make it safely across
<BR>
the border and get past the check points). Others live on the outskirts of
<BR>
cities such as Mexico D.F.
<BR>
<P>This is the ugly side of capitalism.  If I'm not mistaken, the term
<BR>
capitalism describes an economic system, not a political system.  Capitalism
<BR>
can be practised under conditions of anarchy (I'm using the word in the
<BR>
sense of a situation where no person or group of persons has a legal right
<BR>
to initiate force against another person or group)or under the guidance of a
<BR>
totalitarian dictatorship.  At present, the U.S. form of capitalism appears
<BR>
to be what's known as fascism where, on the surface, individual people
<BR>
appear to own &quot;the means of production&quot; but where their ownership is
<BR>
severely limited and the actual control lies with a small elite--in this
<BR>
case, your group of people who hold positions of power in certain
<BR>
governmental and corporate entities. I'm not suggesting that the various
<BR>
conspiracy theories you read about on Patriot web sites are true.  I detest
<BR>
those, because they only reinforce the awe in which people view the elite.
<BR>
I like Ayn Rand's stories much better, because they portray the elite as
<BR>
they actually are--twits with delusions of grandeur. It's awfully
<BR>
unfortunate that the twits are able to get so many productive people to
<BR>
share their delusions.
<BR>
<P>It's true, the twits have some big guns and some secure prisons.  They're
<BR>
purchased via the work of the millions of people who believe in the twits'
<BR>
delusions and dutifully go to work every day so they can pay their taxes.
<BR>
<P>Why is it good to live forever if you're not free?

<EM>&gt; Do you actually believe that capitalism can provide the means to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eradicate poverty?  That if every &quot;lazy, stupid&quot; etc. poor person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;got off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their lazy ass&quot; they could live a life of abundance?  Have you *ever*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traveled to the third world?  Can you possibly believe that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some people are poor is because they are &quot;programmed&quot; to believe the lie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they cannot live any other way?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compared to Lorrey economics, the Lorrey drive looks downright feasible ;)
