<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Are our views &quot;Let's destroy planets!&quot; or are they &quot;Let's create new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; biospheres!&quot;? You might mean the later, but in most communities you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will be misunderstood as the former if you express yourself badly. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is not that the idea is hard to accept that is the problem, it is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the idea itself tends to get overshadowed by how it is expressed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is true, but we might as well develop strategies on how to deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with all possible attitudes. Typically your opposition is going to say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean things about you no matter how well meaning you are. We may say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'create new biospheres' but the opposition will say we mean 'kill off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alien life forms and impose terran ecology as a form of ecological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colonialism/imperialism' or they will use images of the Death Star from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Star Wars blowing up a planet to illustrate how they want the public to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look at us.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, but you shouldn't hand them their weapons, should you? It is one
<BR>
thing if they have to deliberately misrepresent us (and that can be
<BR>
exposed, scoring debate points), another to have to face some idiocy
<BR>
some transhumanist said on a public list and might be taken to
<BR>
represent the kind of wiews transhumanists hold (&quot;I'm not saying *all*
<BR>
transhumanists want to rape biospheres, blow up planets, enslave
<BR>
indiginous people and do away with all undesirables, but obviously
<BR>
*some* do and say so in public...&quot;). This is why it is good to have
<BR>
things like the extropian principles or transhumanist declaration to
<BR>
back you up, showing that whatever some fool may have said it is not
<BR>
compatible with the core transhumanist/extropian values. But this is
<BR>
hard work if there are many quotable idiocies around.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; We are vectors of cultural change. But if we refuse to notice that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people misunderstand us, form prejudiced and erroneous opionons about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; our ethics, values and ideas and then act on them, then we are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; going to be very relevant vectors. Those movements that actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; manage to convey what they mean to significant groups will win.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, to a point. No matter how rosy you are, if someone in power sees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you as a threat, they will hire all the PR goons they can to demonize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you.
</EM><BR>
<P>So what? If we suceed as memetic vectors it is unlikely to happen
<BR>
because our memes have spread into the mainstream, while if we fail as
<BR>
vectors then we will be a weak and irrelevant group which would make
<BR>
great scapegoats or targets of a moral panic.  Given the lack of
<BR>
success the presumably powerful military-industrial complex, biotech
<BR>
industry or internationalist &quot;conspiracy&quot; has had in their propaganda
<BR>
against opposing views in society, I'm not particularly worried. It is
<BR>
when you are small and misunderstood you are vulnerable.
