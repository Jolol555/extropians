Transparency is becoming less &quot;impossible&quot; everyday.  This is from the 
<BR>
3/30/2000 edition of the Los Angeles Daily Journal, page 2:
<BR>
<P>Los Angeles police and city staff members have been directed to advise the 
<BR>
City Council on whether it would be a good idea to equip Los Angeles Police 
<BR>
Department officers with $9,000 microcamera-and-videorecorder systems to 
<BR>
chronicle their interactions with the public.
<BR>
The cameras would attach to vests worn by officers and transmit signals to 
<BR>
videorecorders in the trunks of patrol cars.  The Los Angeles County 
<BR>
sheriffs department is conducting a pilot program with such technology, 
<BR>
according to City Council member Michael Feuer.
<BR>
On a motion Wednesday by Feuer, the police department, the city attorney and 
<BR>
the city's legislative analyst and administrative officer were instructed to 
<BR>
report to council members on the cost restrictions on use, feasibility and 
<BR>
value to the city of a pilot program similar to the sheriffs.  They also 
<BR>
were asked to identify potential funding sources.
<BR>
The use of “personal video-camera” technology could help restore public 
<BR>
trust in the LAPD, increase officer, accountability, avert frivolous 
<BR>
misconduct claims and help the department, evaluate officer liability 
<BR>
according to Feuer.
<BR>
The LAPD is installing video cameras in new patrol cars, and many officers 
<BR>
now use audiotapes “to protect themselves from false claims of misconduct,” 
<BR>
Feuer's motion states.  Vest-mounted microcameras would “serve this purpose 
<BR>
more effectively,” it adds.
