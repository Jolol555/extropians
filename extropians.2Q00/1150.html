Nicholas Carmine Has agreed to take part in a case study to be conducted
<BR>
on the Upgrade-Your-Life List &lt;<A HREF="http://www.buildfreedom.com/lists/upgrade.html">http://www.buildfreedom.com/lists/upgrade.html</A>&gt;.

Here's his original message to me (edited):

<EM> &gt;Subject: I Have Signed One Person in the Last Three Years
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Sad to admit it, but I have only signed up one person in my entire MLM or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;any other money gifting venture. So I will have to ask for assistance. And
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;it is not like I am a Blowit Case or anything like that, if you were to 
</EM><BR>
tell me
<BR>
<EM> &gt;to join opt-in lists and list to FFA links, I will do it to the max. Just 
</EM><BR>
never
<BR>
<EM> &gt;worked out for me yet. My wife thinks that I am insane to even try again,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;but Frederick, something inside me tells me that the key to financial
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;independence is not with my job (Just Over Broke!) I know I am destined
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to make millions! I have requested many men and women to mentor me.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I am a Kung-Fu student. I can imitate my teacher so well, I feel as if I am
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;he -- but me. I know that I can apply the same techniques to becoming
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;solvent. In the past three years, I have lost over $140,000.00 in you name
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;it. I will not be denied.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Thank you for your time. Let me know exactly what I am to do and believe
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;me I will do it.
</EM><BR>
<P>The case study will be conducted on the Upgrade-Your-Life List
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.buildfreedom.com/lists/upgrade.html">http://www.buildfreedom.com/lists/upgrade.html</A>&gt;. The purpose of the study
<BR>
should probably be along the lines of subscribers (including myself) assisting
<BR>
Nicholas to become more successful. Anyone else interested in elevating his
<BR>
or her own level of prosperity is welcome to participate. Similarly, anyone
<BR>
interested in providing assistance to others to raise their level of prosperity
<BR>
(or interested in learning more about how to provide such assistance) is also
<BR>
invited to join us. You can subscribe to the Upgrade-Your-Life List at
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.buildfreedom.com/lists/upgrade.html">http://www.buildfreedom.com/lists/upgrade.html</A>&gt; or by sending a blank
<BR>
email to &lt;<A HREF="mailto:upgrade-subscribe@topica.com?Subject=Re:%20Prosperity%20Case%20Study&In-Reply-To=&lt;4.2.0.58.20000418211512.03625d80@209.150.150.38&gt;">upgrade-subscribe@topica.com</A>&gt;.
