<EM>&gt; Huh? Now you are making no sense at all.  What &quot;If&quot;?? That's the whole
</EM><BR>
point, no
<BR>
<EM>&gt; one has yet been able to duplicate any said function.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not true. I assume you've seen
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm">http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm</A>, since you mentioned
<BR>
Moravec earlier. Surely you don't understand the difference between
<BR>
simulating the internal processes of a neuron and simulating the
<BR>
computations that it performs?
<BR>
<P>Moravec argues that we now know exactly what image-processing operations are
<BR>
done by the human retina, as opposed to other parts of the brain. We also
<BR>
know how many MIPS it takes to do exactly the same operations in a computer
<BR>
(10^3 MIPS). So, we have an empirical yardstick for comparing the actual
<BR>
computational output of a functional unit of the brain to that of a
<BR>
computer.
<BR>
<P>Based on that yardstick, Moravec estimates the total computational power of
<BR>
the brain at 10^8 MIPS. Now, this is obviously a rough estimate, because not
<BR>
all parts of the brain are going to be equally efficient or equally easy to
<BR>
duplicate. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the estimate is low - for
<BR>
example, one could argue that the retina is likely to be one of the most
<BR>
efficient, highly optimized neural structures in the human body simply
<BR>
because of its great evolutionary antiquity, and therefore the estimate is
<BR>
likely to be high.
<BR>
<P>All in all, it seems reasonable to think that Moravec's estimate is within
<BR>
1-2 orders of magnitude of being correct. Since there are currently several
<BR>
operational supercomputers with TeraFLOPS speeds, and a PetaFLOPS machine is
<BR>
under construction, that makes the brain significantly slower than the best
<BR>
modern hardware.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As the 1992 study of the Purkinje demonstrates, it was an extremely
</EM><BR>
difficult
<BR>
<EM>&gt; task to simulate the function of a single neuron - and this was an
</EM><BR>
admittedly
<BR>
<EM>&gt; simplified simulation at that.  It took an i860 processor almost 60
</EM><BR>
minutes to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; simulate a single firing!  So the question still remains how many xflops
</EM><BR>
it's
<BR>
<EM>&gt; going to take to simulate a *typical* neuron of the human brain not
</EM><BR>
including
<BR>
<EM>&gt; any of its self-maintenance functions.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is like arguing that it would take vast oceans of processing power to
<BR>
duplicate my old 8088 machine, because it is so hard to simulate the physics
<BR>
of electron flow in a semiconductor from first principles.
<BR>
<P>If your goal is to simulate the detailed workings of the brain, for medical
<BR>
purposes or scientific curiosity, you are entirely correct. If, however, you
<BR>
are interested in the question of how much hardware a human-equivalent AI
<BR>
would need, it is irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>It doesn't matter how complicated a neuron is. What matters for AI purposes
<BR>
is how much useful computation that complexity produces. The empirical
<BR>
answer appears to be &quot;not very much&quot;.
