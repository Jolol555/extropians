Said: &quot;I have a limited amount of money. Since I don't have to pay for the 
<BR>
software, I can use that money to upgrade my hardware instead...&quot;
<BR>
<P>Linux aint' free !
<BR>
Not if you factor the amount of time and mental bandwidth (property) 
<BR>
required to install and implement Linux on a box, as all versions of Linux 
<BR>
do not work &quot;out of the box&quot; and require allot of tweaking and customizing 
<BR>
to make them run properly, not considering securing yer' box
<BR>
Once SOMEONE makes a Linux distro that works out of the box, (mandrake is 
<BR>
close but very buggy) then Linux 'aint free.
<BR>
<P>I do not want to become a auto mechanic to drive the car, I just want to 
<BR>
drive it.
<BR>
<P>I wish it was, because I like many aspects of it
<BR>
<P>It appears as if Emlyn (pentacle) wrote about link

<P>|The link below is to an article by a senior Kylix team member; they are
<BR>
|moving Delphi &amp; C++ Builder (notable Windows development environment tools)
<BR>

<P>My reasons for preferring Linux over MS-Windows work for me,
<BR>
not necessarily for anybody else.
<BR>
<P>My points for preferring Linux over MS-Windows:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	I want full control over the programs in my cybernetic parts.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they don't do what I want, I can rewrite them to do what I want.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find reprogramming much easier having the source code available. 6-]
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	I have a limited amount of money.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I don't have to pay for the software, I can use that money to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upgrade my hardware instead.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Most of the MIT cyborgs use Linux, so I can re-use their software.
<BR>
<P>As you might appreciate, my reasons for preferring Linux need not be yours.
<BR>
And vice versa.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/kpj
