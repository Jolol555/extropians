<EM>&gt;     &gt;this is what happened in the 30's. There was significant deflation, partly due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;to a tighttened money supply,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;and partly due to overproduction by farmers and manufacturers that only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;knew one thing: producing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The idea that the poverty of the 30's was because people got too good at growing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; food that people could eat and too good at manufacturing products that people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could use is just too silly to debate.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know how much you've read about the period John, but there was serious overproduction,
<BR>
and prices were far below profitable levels for many if not most farmers (i.e. production
<BR>
exceeded demand). Food was not transported to market because it would have cost even more,
<BR>
leading to even greater financial losses, it was left to rot, milk was drained from vats, etc...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; [if we had cheap fusion power] All except for the millions of people who work in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;the energy recovery, distribution, and generation industries. They'd all be out of work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, they'd just be out of the oil business.
</EM><BR>
<P>And how quickly do you think it would take for them to go into another line of work? And how do
<BR>
you suggest they pay for the rebuilding of their entire industry base (esp. considering existing
<BR>
debt levels and little or no income)????  Take a look at Russia right now. Its been 10 years
<BR>
since their defense industry collapsed (about 50% of their entire economy) and the place is still
<BR>
a shithole. Russia is a textbook example of what happens when a whole industry becomes obsolete
<BR>
overnight.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;Since their industries make up some thing like 25% of our economy, at least, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;you are talking about a major contraction,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, because now the nuclear fusion industry would make up 40% of a vastly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; larger economy.
</EM><BR>
<P>You sure? I don't think so. I'm not talking centralized plants with grids like today, I'm talking
<BR>
a Mr. Fusion in your basement. Any new industry is not going to be burdened, and will not want to
<BR>
be burdened by unionized employees. They will automate as much of their manufacturing as
<BR>
possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;      &gt;making a whole economy obsolete overnight, or almost  overnight will cause
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;a) people to not invest in anything, because they can't be sure if it will be viable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;or dead 6 months down the road,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, there is a chance every cent of your investment could be lost, but that never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stopped anyone before so I don't see why it would do so now, because there is also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a chance your investment could make you filthy rich. 10 years ago when somebody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invested in a tiny company called CISCO I'm sure the thought crossed their mind that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they might never see that money again, they took the chance anyway and today are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very glad they did
</EM><BR>
<P>Would you have invested in CISCO telephone wire routers if you knew that another technology was
<BR>
12 months down the road that would give you 100x the capability for the exact same price? I don't
<BR>
think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;If you magically introduced one of these aircars for a price of about $20,000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; today, with a production capacity of a million units a year, GM, Ford, Toyota, Daimler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; Chrysler, et al would all be declaring bankruptcy in short order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good! A company stupid enough to be ignorant of advances in its own industry and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ignores such a historic opportunity should go bankrupt; they're just too dumb to live.
</EM><BR>
<P>I noticed you deleted my explaination for why they'd be screwed no matter how much they wanted to
<BR>
and were capable of building an aircar.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;and you'd have millions of unionized autoworkers out on the streets unemployed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then who is making all those aircars?
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe Moller or somebody like him, with a billion dollar fully automated aircar factories that
<BR>
employ less than 10% of the number of people for the same number of vehicles produced.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; Are you starting to see what I am getting at?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nope.
