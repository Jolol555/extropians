<P><EM>&gt;I just finished reading &quot;The Mating Mind&quot;, by Geoffrey Miller.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I just submitted a review to amazon.com (my first there), giving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it five stars, and titled &quot;He's asking all the right questions&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't recall if I posted this previously, but here are some far less
<BR>
exact, but equally enthusiastic, brief comments in praise of Miller, and
<BR>
mentioning some adjacent books:
<BR>
<P>The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature
<BR>
Geoffrey Miller
<BR>
Heinemann, 
<BR>
<P>In a charmingly clever book, Miller argues that charm and cleverness are no
<BR>
mere froth on Darwin's cappuccino, but actually the motive power behind
<BR>
human distinctiveness. We've evolved song, art, sport, jokes and skiing as
<BR>
part of a non-stop courtship repertoire. Women's sexual choices over
<BR>
100,000 years and more have shaped men, including the much-reviled penis,
<BR>
and their own choosy and reluctant clitoris. Both sexes built intelligence
<BR>
out of millennia of cries and whispers: `the mind evolved by moonlight'. It
<BR>
sounds glib but Miller mounts a handsome and enticing argument.
<BR>
<P>Dear Mr Darwin: Letters on the Evolution of Life and Human Nature
<BR>
Gabriel Dover, W&amp;N/Dent, 
<BR>
<P>At a far extreme from the subtle glances and sighs of sexual selection,
<BR>
molecular chemistry reveals a dizzying realm of genetic shenanigans. Are
<BR>
`selfish genes' engaged in endless contest and grudging cooperation, or is
<BR>
life more than molecules red in tooth and claw? Leicester genetics
<BR>
professor Dover popularises a fresh and challenging idea (18 years after he
<BR>
proposed it in the specialist literature). `Molecular drive' happens when
<BR>
small mutations literally jump around the chromosomes, spread swiftly by
<BR>
`adoptation', and colonise an entire genome, even leaping between species.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a bold move that's either engaging or cheesy, the book is a
<BR>
correspondence between Gabby Dover and the ghost of Charles Darwin. Clear
<BR>
and sometimes lyrical, he argues passionately that we idiosyncratic
<BR>
individuals, not the swarms of genes whose unique interactions help build
<BR>
us, are the key to evolutionary selection.
<BR>
<P>The Second Creation: The Age of Biological Control by the Scientists who
<BR>
Cloned Dolly
<BR>
Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell and Colin Tudge
<BR>
Hodder Headline, 
<BR>
<P>Has the individual a future now nuclear cloning is an industrial process?
<BR>
Already Dolly the sheep, cloned by Wilmut and Campbell at Roslin Institute
<BR>
from a dead ewe's udder tissue, has her own daughter. Other species are
<BR>
being cloned - although not yet humans. Tudge reworks the scientists?
<BR>
accounts into a slightly stodgy saga of skill and ethics. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So will identical babies be die-stamped out in cold laboratories? Hardly.
<BR>
Four rams cloned from the same embryo - Cedric, Cyril, Cecil and Tuppence -
<BR>
`are very different in size and temperament'. (It is not made clear if they
<BR>
all dote on musicals.) Diversity among clones shouldn't be a shock.
<BR>
Canada's famous Dionne quins were a natural clone, raised identically, yet
<BR>
they varied a lot. One died at 20, another at 36, while the rest lived into
<BR>
rather gloomy old age. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real value of cloning is the control it gives over cell lines, the
<BR>
space opened for precise genetic modifications. Will that affect humans?
<BR>
Surely, but don't expect cloning to become a fashion statement.
<BR>
<P>Brave New Worlds: Genetics and the Human Experience
<BR>
Bryan Appleyard
<BR>
HarperCollins, 
<BR>
<P>Appleyard, an articulate British pundit, is scared witless by cloning and
<BR>
other genomic advances, and the eugenic agenda he spies behind genetic
<BR>
engineering. Surprisingly, his short book provides a deft, accurate summary
<BR>
of the state of play. Unlike some conservatives, he sees that seemingly
<BR>
far-fetched applications - physical immortality, enhanced intelligence -
<BR>
are actually very plausible indeed. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, many of his anxieties derive from his fear that scientists think
<BR>
they're right about everything. Yet to a quite remarkable extent science is
<BR>
a culture devoted to novel challenges. Dover and Miller or Dawkins, say,
<BR>
share a public method for adjudicating their differences. A curiously Old
<BR>
Testament thunder rolls behind Appleyard's measured words: thou shalt have
<BR>
no other gods. It's an odd affliction in someone bemoaning the arrogance of
<BR>
science.
