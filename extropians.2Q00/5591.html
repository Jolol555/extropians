Bonnie,
<BR>
The more I read what you write, the more I feel like I'm in a presence of a superwoman. Are you a real person, Bonnie? And not some sophisticated Eliza program that maybe my ancient Macintosh inserted into my daily Extropy digests?
<BR>

<P>Very high praise, indeed...  Bonnie is someone who has done so much in her life.  I keep on thinking how she has come full circle.  I remember hearing of a science fiction short story about a future earth society where only the wealthiest could back out of the consumerist treadmill and live simply!   
<BR>
<P>Sigh, now I really want to meet her at the next Extro.
<BR>
I hope she'll there. :)
<BR>
<P>I read the book excerpt to a female friend who really enjoyed it.  I can see how for a young teenage girl it could be especially good.  I will have to search for the book and maybe get multiple copies.
<BR>
<P>For all I live in Alaska I don't get out all that much.  The last time I went on a major hike was last year(just Denali park).  I remember once as a boy going on a hike by myself while my family stayed at the campsite.  I felt so at peace with an enclosed ceiling of high tree branches overhead.  It felt almost magical.  I felt like a character from a Tolkien novel(but there were no giant spiders around:)).
