<EM>&gt;  You apparently have a *much* better control over your emotions than I do.  
</EM><BR>
I 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  can tell myself that anger is pointless, but that won't abate my anger if 
</EM><BR>
I 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  am angry.  Not only is Hitler dead, he died decades before I was born.  
</EM><BR>
Yet 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I cannot help feeling anger toward anyone who could victimize innocent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  humans the way he did.  The fact that he is dead has absolutely no bearing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  on how I feel toward him.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not saying by the way that you SHOULDN'T feel anger BTW. Just wondering 
<BR>
what good it does.
<BR>
<P>No, it's not about control. It's about expressing my feelings. It's my 
<BR>
nature. I am an &quot;expression&quot; oriented person. Keeping my anger inside doesn't 
<BR>
suit me. To be angry at a dead person means I am really just &quot;experiencing&quot; 
<BR>
anger, not expressing it. 
<BR>
Just as you &quot;cannot help&quot; your anger, I &quot;cannot help&quot; knowing that he was 
<BR>
long dead, but  he gained that much power anyway due to political climatees, 
<BR>
and wondering what weird and twisted environment made such a creature. He was 
<BR>
clearly the biggest asshole that walked the earth since Vlad the Impaler (are 
<BR>
you mad at him too?...
<BR>
<P>That doesn't mean I don't feel all those other feelings (sickened, shocked, 
<BR>
horrified, appalled and distressed) when I think about his victims. 
<BR>
<P>Unless I was to rage outwardly to others ( who do not deserve it) about 
<BR>
Hitler, where would I put this anger? Well, I suppose it would have to stay 
<BR>
inside. Which would only harm *me*, by raising my blood pressure, or making 
<BR>
me cry or pound some other outlet. So I am not controlled, just expression 
<BR>
oriented.  
<BR>
<P>I &quot;couldn't help&quot; expressing anger at someone who *likes* Hitler's ideas 
<BR>
TODAY, so I'd probably go ballistic on you if you said you were trying to 
<BR>
convert me to the Aryan Nation ... or the Religious Right-wing party....
<BR>
<P>No, anyone who knows me will tell you I don't have specific control over my 
<BR>
emotions.. I have feelings like waterfalls...  maybe just a more cultivated 
<BR>
sense of how to best express them... since I use them so much. I literally 
<BR>
practice emotion. I love feelings, hell I am an artist, they are my palette 
<BR>
as much as my paints.
<BR>
<P>Emotions as I see them -- are useful. Perhaps there is some use for being you 
<BR>
angry at Hitler?  ; ) 
<BR>
<P>Nadia
<BR>
PS: 
<BR>
<P>Zero, if I found myself confronted with inner rage at somethign I could not 
<BR>
change, I might do some artwork about it or write a play.... Again.. 
<BR>
expression is key for my development... maybe not yours though...  I'm not 
<BR>
saying you are wrong.. just explaining my brain.
