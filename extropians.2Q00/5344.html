<P><EM>&gt; I support this principle wholeheartedly; when I joined the list  I did not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  When I joined, I was one of those democratic socialist leaning types,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  basically thinking that western capitalism is nasty, and a bigger 
</EM><BR>
government
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  would help. Now I am much, much more in favour of dynamic, bottom-up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  solutions to social organisation; thank you. A caveat: I still support many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  current big-government ideas (such as welfare) out of pragmatism; they do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  not belong in my vision of the future to anywhere near the extent that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  exist in my ideals about the present.
</EM><BR>
<P>Although I certainly wouldn't describe my political philosophy of ten years 
<BR>
ago as &quot;democratic socialist&quot;, I am much more libertarian now than I was 
<BR>
before I became actively involved in this community.  Over the years, folks 
<BR>
like Max, David Friedman and Robin Hanson have convinced me that it is 
<BR>
possible to create structures of social governance that are much more 
<BR>
rational and free than those that characterize even the freest of our current 
<BR>
societies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I feel that capitalism, or standard &quot;free&quot;-market organisation, does not 
</EM><BR>
fit
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  principle 5 very well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Obviously &quot;mainstream extropians&quot; (how's that for an ironic oxymoron?) would 
<BR>
disagree.  Let's see if I can talk about how below . . .
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  ---------
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  freedom of speech - Is this true in the corporate world?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  And no.  A society that lives up to the fifth Extropian Principle 
<BR>
would, it seems to me, allow people to voluntarily &quot;restrict speech&quot; within 
<BR>
certain defined parameters.  I run a business.  I believe that it is 
<BR>
perfectly consistent with principles of individual liberty for me to expect 
<BR>
that my employees will not spend all of their time at the office engaging in 
<BR>
abstract philosophical discussions, or disputations regarding the relative 
<BR>
merits of the Houston Astros and the Colorado Rockies.  Is it OK for them to 
<BR>
do this some time while they're on my payroll?  Sure.  Do my employees know 
<BR>
that I &quot;forbid&quot; them to spend all of their time in &quot;unproductive&quot; 
<BR>
discussions?  Yes.  Am I thus a tyrant?  I don't think so.
<BR>
<P>Likewise, if a non-employee publishes an article critical of my firm, may I 
<BR>
take legal action to oppose such speech - in a free society?  It depends.  If 
<BR>
the article contains lies, I ought to have the right to take some kind of 
<BR>
action against the slanderer, if she has caused me some tangible harm in the 
<BR>
process.  I don't think this is inconsistent with Principle No. 5.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  freedom of action - Within strict boundaries. Particularly, one is excluded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  from any kind of real say in how any org is run, unless one runs or owns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that org.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I don't think it's possible to make rigid rules in this area.  Some 
<BR>
&quot;organizations&quot; require fairly strict conduct guidelines.  I think it's 
<BR>
consistent with individual liberty for an airline to prohibit its pilots from 
<BR>
flying while under the influence of drugs that can impair their judgment and 
<BR>
reflexes.  Obviously many organizations have gone way too far in this kind of 
<BR>
thing and I think it's imperative that rational people work to oppose such 
<BR>
irrelevant restrictions on individual liberty.  As a wise man once said, &quot;the 
<BR>
price of liberty is eternal vigilance&quot;.  I doubt that any society will ever 
<BR>
work out clear, mechanical rules that will define borders in every 
<BR>
conceivable case between rationally acceptable restrictions on individual 
<BR>
liberty and the natural tendency of some people to be &quot;bossy&quot; about their 
<BR>
associates' conduct.
<BR>
<P>In terms of having a &quot;real say in how an organization is run&quot;, I think 
<BR>
there's an invigorating process of natural selection and evolution in a 
<BR>
maximally free society with market economics.  Organizations that restrict 
<BR>
input into their policies too tightly will become ossified and uncompetitive. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Consider how General Motors has seen a long period of decline relative to 
<BR>
the reborn Chrysler organization.  GM's highly centralized, hierarchical 
<BR>
management structure has proved to be woefully maladapted to a world of rapid 
<BR>
prototyping and increasingly fragmented and well-educated consumer demands.  
<BR>
GM will have to learn to accept input from a wider sphere, from both within 
<BR>
and outside it's organization - or it will die.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  favoring the rule of law - No, we have the rule of money, which is entirely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  coersive in many cases
</EM><BR>
<P>Yow!  Emlyn, come spend a week in my office if you think that the rule of law 
<BR>
isn't a vital and important part of a modern capitalist society.  &quot;Money&quot; is 
<BR>
a factor in the operation of law, but it is by no means the only factor.  If 
<BR>
the rule of law wasn't important, then my clientele (which is mainly - but 
<BR>
not exclusively - large, well-financed institutions) wouldn't need my 
<BR>
services and could count on succeeding in all of their disputes with &quot;the 
<BR>
little guy&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  bargaining over battling - Much of the really big, really influential 
</EM><BR>
market
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  behaviour by the big orgs looks a lot more like battling than bargaining;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  they just don't physically attack each other.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Conflict&quot; is a necessary part of any complex, dynamic, adaptive system.  The 
<BR>
PROCESS of civilization is fundamentally the dynamic of &quot;taming&quot; this fact 
<BR>
and sublimating conflict into the behavior of bargaining.  But competition is 
<BR>
an inevitable fact of life.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  exchange over compulsion - As above; the rule of money is all about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  compulsion (power), and coersion.
</EM><BR>
<P>This may be a matter of personality and perspective, but I see maneuvering 
<BR>
for advantage in exchange relationships as an inevitable part of dynamic, 
<BR>
adaptive systems.  Wishing it wasn't so is utopian fantasy that inevitably 
<BR>
leads to tyrannical stasist idealism.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Openness to improvement rather than a static utopia - Within strict
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  bounds!!! The market favours short term approaches, because it's such a 
</EM><BR>
shit
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  fight. Improvement then is strongly limited to local solutions, and goes 
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  local maxima all to easily. However, it's not static, and it's not Utopia,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  so there is some fit.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that the tendency toward short-sightedness is THE single biggest 
<BR>
problem with market systems as currently constituted.  But consider 
<BR>
innovations like Robin's Idea Futures market and Sasha Chislenko's 
<BR>
&quot;hypereconomy&quot; ideas.  We get better at things, if given the chance.  I think 
<BR>
what's required is taking a broader view of what a market is.  We DO have to 
<BR>
work on this point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I have two major problems with the free-market economy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  1 - Exclusion: Most people are excluded from having a say in most things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Parliamentary democracy was meant (maybe) to address this, and is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  admirable institution... which looks like an anachronism in the context of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the information/communication revolution.
</EM><BR>
<P>Time constraints make it impossible for me to write fully on the &quot;extropian&quot; 
<BR>
view of parliamentary democracy, but increasing the scope of influence that 
<BR>
an individual has over their own life is fundamental to the extropian 
<BR>
world-view.  As technophiles, we see improvement in this realm through 
<BR>
individual empowerment with the tools we can develop.  The tension between 
<BR>
those who would restrict individual autonomy and those who see freedom as a 
<BR>
fundamental good is one those things that makes life interesting :-)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  2 - Destructive competition. As far as I can see, there are two types of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  competition; constructive (lets run a race, first one to the end wins), and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  destructive (well, you are faster than me, so I'll trip you up, and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I'll win). Destructive competition is what people complain about with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Microsoft, and it is hard to blame them for using it; that's how this 
</EM><BR>
system
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  works. While it is easy to see the benefits on all sides of constructive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  competition, the last-man-standing approach just seems like a bloody waste.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I have the beginnings of a viable alternative, but I'll leave that to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  later post.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd love to see your thoughts on it.  For now (being on the run this morning 
<BR>
for an early appointment - hopefully I'll have more time to write later), 
<BR>
I'll just say that the tool fo the rule of law is the most important factor 
<BR>
that the Enlightenment has given us as a means for making competition 
<BR>
CONSTRUCTIVE instead of destructive.
