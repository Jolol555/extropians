<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Now, lets assume that another bombing has occured. Mr. Powers happens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;a) have a deisel tractor (and a fuel tank to keep it fuelled), b) be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;farmer, so he has a lot of fertilizer, c) be an electronics hobbyist,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;and enjoy making remote control devices, d) be known to have made up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;explosives in the past and used them on his private property simply for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;the purpose of clearing stumps (as is the case with thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;farmers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;and other property owners all over the country), e) have in the past
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;written letters to the editor of his local paper decrying the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;activities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;of an organization or government agency that happened to have had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;offices or facilities at the site of the bombing, f) have been stopped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;for a traffic violation on the day of the bombing within 20 miles of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;bombing location. Under the rules of evidence and the prosecutorial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;procedure used in the Oklahoma case, its is pretty much an open and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shut
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;case that Mr. Powers is the bomber in this event. No eyewitnesses are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;needed to place him on the scene at the time of the bombing, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;eyewitnesses are needed to prove that he actually made the bomb.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;This IS how justice gets done today in America.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; OK, lets assume all that.  Now, lets *also* assume I was fortunate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; live in a tranparent society.  I would submit the video record of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; during the few days leading up to the bombing and viola! instant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;iron-clad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; allibi!  I'm not only *not* convicted, I'm not even charged!  After a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; minutes of interrogation, the whole ordeal for me is over for good.  &quot;Oh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; horrors of transparency&quot;, eh?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thats not Transparent society, that is private serveillance. Not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same. Besides that, it would not take the government much work to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'prove' that your coverage was faked.
</EM><BR>
<P>1. There is nothing that requires a &quot;transparent society&quot; to consist of
<BR>
government-only surveillance.  My preference would be for *everyone* to
<BR>
conduct their own surveillance which could be verified, if necessary, by
<BR>
anyone else's surveillance.
<BR>
<P>2. You are *assuming* that when I said &quot;I would submit the video record of
<BR>
my life&quot; that I meant my own private recordings.  That is not necessarily
<BR>
what I meant.  As you suggest, it would be even that much better for me if
<BR>
the video record had been created and/or maintained by the Government.  That
<BR>
would take away the one possible problem for me: the claim that I had
<BR>
altered the record.  If the government had its own copy (and assuming it
<BR>
showed the same thing as my copy) then my life is even easier.
<BR>
<P>Of course if I was the actual bomber the last thing in the world I'd want is
<BR>
for a mutually verifiable accurate record of my doings.  Which goes back to
<BR>
my main argument: that honest folk have much more to gain, and much less to
<BR>
fear, from a transparent society.  You, by your own hypothetical, have made
<BR>
this point for me as eloquently as I could ever hope to.  Thanks
<BR>

<P>Here in this state it is illegal to videotape an officer, but not illegal 
<BR>
for an officer to videotape you.
