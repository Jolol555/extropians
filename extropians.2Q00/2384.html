&quot;White, Ryan&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ryan@dvelco.com?Subject=Re:%20Can%20I%20kill%20a%20Copy?%20(long)&In-Reply-To=&lt;007601bfb701$7ad20de0$04000100@newstrom&gt;">ryan@dvelco.com</A>&gt; asks on Friday, May 05, 2000 3:13 PM,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Question: I don't recall who originated this thread, but you know who you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are (or, as the case may be, 'were').  Of this person, I ask:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was activation implied by 'copy', or no?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ryan v23.9
</EM><BR>
<P>Hahahahahahaha  (evil laugh).  I started this thread, and I'm glad.  And I'd
<BR>
do it again, too!  Hahahahahaha, nobody can stop the evil thread that
<BR>
wouldn't die....
<BR>
<P>Sorry.  I almost feel like someone else said that.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I don't think that activation was ruled in or out of the examples.
<BR>
This is what I think causes a lot of our &quot;disagreements&quot; on this question.
<BR>
We sometimes interpret ideas differently.  I don't think anybody really
<BR>
agreed on what the question was.  I'm not sure anybody has ever agreed to
<BR>
the detailed definition of this question.  I am beginning to think that this
<BR>
whole question is a semantic trick with smoke and mirrors.
<BR>
<P>If the copies are somehow &quot;forced&quot; to keep in synch, then I'm not sure they
<BR>
both can be considered conscious or actually interacting with the world.
<BR>
They couldn't be walking around and perceiving reality normally, because
<BR>
they would be in different locations.  I doubt that molecularly exact
<BR>
environments could exist due to random molecular motion.  In a digital
<BR>
world, I'm not sure exact environments could be simulated due to slight
<BR>
variations in hardware and random bit errors.  At least one copy would have
<BR>
to be &quot;controlled&quot; to keep it in synch with the other copy.  I don't believe
<BR>
that both copies could stay in synch otherwise.  Thus, I think this question
<BR>
is asking about what should be allowed in a theoretically impossible
<BR>
situation.  I don't think the situation could really arise.
<BR>
<P>If the copies are not forced to stay in synch, I believe one must diverge.
<BR>
As soon as they diverge, they are not exact copies, but separate and
<BR>
distinct individuals (according to most people).  Therefore the question
<BR>
does not arise.  Thus, I am leaning toward concluding that the question is
<BR>
ambiguous and meaningless, and can't be &quot;answered&quot;.
