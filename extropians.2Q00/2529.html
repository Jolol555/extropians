Subject: Re: Understanding Academia

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; But the point is whose rules .... I am outside the academic journal loop,
</EM><BR>
so
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; might be said to playing *against* the academic game rather than in it. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; aim for a big inter-theoretic reduction that will shake-up many
</EM><BR>
academics.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You don't play against other games; you play against other players in a
</EM><BR>
game.
<BR>
<P>This is plainly  wrong .... surely Basketball and American Football and
<BR>
Ice-Hockey compete for the same sports audience!? And what about the role of
<BR>
the &quot;house&quot; in casino games, which is both meta-player and referee!?
<BR>
<P>And if I am &quot;playing&quot; against other academics in some &quot;authority&quot; game, then
<BR>
this game is bigger than just the academic arena, and the rules are not the
<BR>
conventionalist academic rules, since I don't need any academic journals or
<BR>
institutions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Academia has succeeded across many centuries as remaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the most authoritative source people turn to when asking abstract
</EM><BR>
questions.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Along with the various Churches &amp;c, yes, it has been the &quot;establishment&quot;
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the human-era past, but with the post-human age will not necessarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue to have authority. It must earn this authority constantly by
</EM><BR>
being
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;correct.&quot;  ... if academics are wrong surely they forfeit authority?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Being wrong sometimes won't hurt academia very much, if there is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clearcompetitor that is right more often.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a difference of scale ... academia being right often on minor
<BR>
things, but if it is wrong on (arguably) the biggest question, then this
<BR>
error might prove fatal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You might personally be right.  But you aren't an institution people can
</EM><BR>
turn to again and again to ask &gt;questions.  How often are people *like you*
<BR>
right?
<BR>
<P>For a start everyone is unique, and no one else is like me (apart from which
<BR>
I have done the academic stint).
<BR>
<P>Einstein for one was outside the academic loop during his breakthrough
<BR>
years. Wittgenstein got pissed off with academia and left. The list is
<BR>
actually quite long .....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;That is, consider the set of people who look to ordinary people similar to
</EM><BR>
you in terms of ability to answer &gt;abstract questions; how often are they
<BR>
right?
<BR>
<P>The mavericks are often correct, because complaince and agreement with the
<BR>
norm isn't going to acheive any breakthrough. The true innovator must
<BR>
&quot;rebel&quot; against the norm ..... in some way or other, if only on the
<BR>
intellectual plane and not the political ... my departure from the
<BR>
human-been identity is more radical (or more precocious) than most.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But the point is whose rules .... I am outside the academic journal loop,
</EM><BR>
so
<BR>
<EM>&gt;might be said to playing *against* the academic game rather than in it. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aim for a big inter-theoretic reduction that will shake-up many academics.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Academia has succeeded across many centuries as remaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the most authoritative source people turn to when asking abstract
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;questions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ha, are you being serious. You get a different answer from virtually every
<BR>
academic you ask, because none of them know for sure. Lawyers and
<BR>
journalists are very aware that for every &quot;expert&quot; there is an equal and
<BR>
opposite one somewhere else in academia.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Along with the various Churches &amp;c, yes, it has been the &quot;establishment&quot; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the human-era past, but with the post-human age will not necessarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;continue to have authority. It must earn this authority constantly by being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;correct.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>... if academics are wrong surely they forfeit authority?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You can see this by seeing who reporters ask, or policy makers ask, when
</EM><BR>
they
<BR>
<EM>&gt;want to ask a question about an area they don't know very well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which makes a different point that maybe the *reporters* are the
<BR>
idea-formers ... I am certainly going the TV route with my new MVT
<BR>
documentary ... although I do include interviews with prominent academics in
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Although we might think we see lots of inefficiencies in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how it works, we must acknowledge that it has so far beat most competitors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hands down in the niche it competes for.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What competitors are you talking about here?
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose the religious authorities are what you have in mind ...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you are trying to convince the world you have a better approach to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mind body question, you are most certainly competing most directly with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;academics.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK Robin, which academics are offering a theory of the evolution of all
<BR>
types of consciousness (waking and sleeping) that competes with MVT? Sure
<BR>
there are piecemeal findings on a range of topics, but I have not come
<BR>
across anything remotely on the scale of MVT (except possibly for Jerison's
<BR>
Recency Theory, which is severely flawed, and even then does not give an
<BR>
account for paradoxical sleep/ dreams).
<BR>
<P>Maybe you think MVT isn't true? <A HREF="http://www.multi.co.uk/primal.htm">http://www.multi.co.uk/primal.htm</A> Space will
<BR>
be given to you in EXTROPIA to make a good counter-case.
