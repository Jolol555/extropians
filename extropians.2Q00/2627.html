<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Most of list subscribers probably don't understand the mechanics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the scope of control present in totalitarian states, not having lived
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; in one. Why do you think it can never happen here?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It could very easily happen here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There has never in the history of humanity been a nation which allows its 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizens as many freedoms as ours.  There has similarly never been a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government which is as accountable to the populace as ours is.  There has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never before been a nation in which the press has had an absolutely 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfettered right to criticize the government.  There has never before been a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; populace which has been as well educated and informed as we are now.  There 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has never been a time where the average citizen could reach as wide an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; audience as any member of the media or the goverment until now.
</EM><BR>
<P>True.  And being well-educated, free, and informed, as well as
<BR>
imaginative, we see the flaws and the possible flaws.  We want to preserve
<BR>
what is good about this society and improve that which is imperfect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I mean come on!  In light of the recent thread regarding politeness, I will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guard my words as much as possible.  I am *not* calling anyone here stupid.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But, it seems to me that to believe that America of 2000 a.d. could somehow 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suddenly devolve &quot;very easily&quot; into a totalitarian state is..., well..., 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; um..., way, way, very much less than reasonable?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Any government tends towards tyranny.  (The problem with power is that
<BR>
when you give it to people, they want more of it.).  Even as we have
<BR>
rectified some of the injustices of the past, we have added new victimless
<BR>
crimes to our lawbooks.  We fight tooth and nail to keep what freedom of
<BR>
speech we have, and we don't always win.  If we assume that &quot;it happening
<BR>
here&quot; is unreasonable, we've already given &quot;it&quot; a way in.  Eternal freedom
<BR>
requires eternal vigilance (on the part of the free, that is).  (Yes, I've
<BR>
not only read 1984, I've read The Dispossessed too!  :)   )
