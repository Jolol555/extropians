<EM>&gt; &gt;A friend of mine has been talking about setting up a business to do this.

<EM>&gt; &gt;He wouldn't rent out robots, of course, since the technology isn't up to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it, but he would rent out people. Someone would go to a meeting or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;whatever, and would be equiped with a full set of computerized audio-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;visual communications gear. He would be your agent, with you watching
</EM><BR>
over
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;his shoulder and prompting him as to what to say and do. It sounds a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;little strange to me, but he thinks it would fly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Zero:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Seems a little strange to me too.  For my money I'd much rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teleconference.  For me, the only reason to face-to-face with clients is
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; enhance interpersonal relationships (its hard to buy somebody a drink via
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teleconference link).  That goal would hardly be helped by sending a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stranger wearing a cell phone ear-plug and a VR headset.
</EM><BR>
<P>I find teleconferences are a really poor medium for interpersonal
<BR>
communication, especially if it involves building trust, and such things as
<BR>
initial brainstorming sessions, design, stuff where the parties involved
<BR>
need to make something up from nothing/not much, and do not as yet share a
<BR>
cohesive vision regarding whatever it is that they are embarking on. Also,
<BR>
doing job interviews by teleconference is really, really awful.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure if the employed actor (actor meant in the fashion of &quot;someone
<BR>
who acts on your behalf) is good for building trust, but I'm sure it would
<BR>
help with those situations where people with whom you need to negotiate
<BR>
really want a physical presence in front of them.
<BR>
<P>Personally I think the robots would do better, but as has been said, the
<BR>
technology isn't quite up to it. That said, remember that this is not a
<BR>
robot which must work on its own; it has a dedicated human pulling the
<BR>
strings, so the job of control is simplified immensely. Not, I think, down
<BR>
to the level where it is actually currently practical, but perhaps close.
<BR>
Most important I think is high speed wireless communications. The same kind
<BR>
of links that will make net-connected wearable computing work might also
<BR>
make the remote robot body a possibility.
<BR>
<P>As I think more about this idea of the robot body for use by a remote human,
<BR>
I am more convinced of it's utility. As the bodies became more
<BR>
sophistitated, the experience from the driver's point of view would be more
<BR>
and more realistic. Just as a teleconference is a poor (poor!) second to
<BR>
being there, so would be a robot &quot;avatar&quot;, but it would be a substantial
<BR>
improvement over current options.
<BR>
<P>The logical extrapolation of this idea sees the suburban &quot;home-fortress&quot;
<BR>
increasing to become something without any doors. If you need to do
<BR>
something physically, outside the home, you connect to &quot;Rent-a-robot&quot;.
<BR>
Better yet, if you have to commute to work, just control your Hyundai
<BR>
ExcelRobot, which zips down the highway into the city on wheels, then
<BR>
changes to a four-legged style motion to enter the building where you work.
<BR>
It has hands, eyes, ears, and can get up to your desk, plonk itself down,
<BR>
and work away (all remotely guided by you).
<BR>
<P>The idea of sending your robot off to work to tap at a computer keyboard is
<BR>
ridiculous (and so will probably happen somewhere), but the idea that a
<BR>
robotic body could be you, when you do work where you must be present, seems
<BR>
quite feasible, especially in a society where computer technology is
<BR>
screaming along, high bandwidth comms is commonplace, and people are
<BR>
increasingly reluctant to travel, because it is inconvenient, expensive, and
<BR>
dangerous.
<BR>
<P>Haven't we been seeing lots of stuff about people doing surgery remotely
<BR>
with the benefit of robot arms, etc...? Why not the robot body? I admit that
<BR>
the optic fibre trailing down the street behind &quot;you&quot; would be a little
<BR>
inconvenient...
