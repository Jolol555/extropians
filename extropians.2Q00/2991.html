<BR>
<EM>&gt; How important is the physical aspect of the potential lover?
</EM><BR>
<P>It matters the type of love.  Romantic love definitely involves a
<BR>
physical -- more specifically, a sexual, aspect.  Without it, I'd say it's
<BR>
not romantic love, but some other sort.  (Check out Nathaniel Branden's work
<BR>
in this area, from _The Psychology of Romantic Love_ to his many other
<BR>
works.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What if a person develops feelings of deep friendship and love for someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with whom they've corresponded on the internet?  And then the person finds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out that the object of his love is somehow physically inaccessable--maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the loved one resides on a faraway planet or is a consciousness arising
</EM><BR>
from
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a computer network?
</EM><BR>
<P>Is this purely an academic question?  Or is this an attempt to justify
<BR>
something?
<BR>
<P>Interesting coincidence: several days ago, I finished reading Peter S.
<BR>
Beagle's _A Fine and Private Place_.  In this, his first novel, part of the
<BR>
plot is the love between two ghosts who cannot come to any physical
<BR>
consumation.  (It's not his best work.  I think _The Last Unicorn_ is his
<BR>
best and is also a &quot;must read.&quot;:)  I would not claim that Beagle has all the
<BR>
answers here, but it was a good read.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  The consciousness is still there for the person as it has been throughout
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the relationship, but now that any chance of physical contact is
</EM><BR>
precluded,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; will the friendship change?  George Bernard Shaw once said that &quot;The
</EM><BR>
perfect
<BR>
<EM>&gt; love affair is one which is conducted entirely by post.&quot;  But could one
</EM><BR>
HAVE
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a love affair with someone who, as far as the person is concerned, is pure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consicousness?
</EM><BR>
<P>But was Shaw being serious?  Often, he was being funny or sarcastic or both.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What if the pure consciousness is so far superior to anyone else the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person's ever known that he realizes he'll never be able to love another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human?  The physically inaccessible being is his &quot;one-and-only&quot;...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would the person suffer extreme despair and want to die?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think this would depend on how the consciousness is constituted.  First of
<BR>
all, I would question the use of &quot;pure&quot; here, but that's a minor quibble.
<BR>
What I mean by &quot;constituted&quot; is what sort of tendencies and such it has?  As
<BR>
humans, we are social animals and our tendency to flourish in society.  This
<BR>
is not an argument for communitarianism, but merely underscores an important
<BR>
part of being human.
<BR>
<P>Whether all consciousness, especially consciousnesses superior to ours
<BR>
(along what parameters would this be measured?  IQ?:) need this sort of
<BR>
social setting is debatable.  Several years ago in _Objectivity_ 1(2) Marsha
<BR>
Enright proposed that humans need relationships also to see themselves.  Her
<BR>
notion is that each person uses another person's consciousness as a sort of
<BR>
mirror.  So, perhaps even a superior-to-human consciousness would also need
<BR>
such a mirror, though perhaps one that is on the same level, to get the kind
<BR>
of feedback it needs to understand itself.  (See her &quot;Why Man Needs
<BR>
Approval&quot; -- which is, sadly, not online.  See
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.bomis.com/objectivity/">http://www.bomis.com/objectivity/</A> for more on _Objectivity_.)
<BR>
<P>Also, romantic love usually implies some sort of equality.  Being
<BR>
romantically &quot;in love&quot; with someone who is markedly unequal in an important
<BR>
way makes it less like love, I feel, and more like some unequal relationship
<BR>
such as parent/child or teacher/student or mentor/protege.  Sadly, I believe
<BR>
a lot of so called romantic relationships are just that, but then it is hard
<BR>
to find someone who is an equal yet who is also different and interesting in
<BR>
complimentary ways.
<BR>
<P>My two cents!
<BR>
