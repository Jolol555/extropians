<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The antidepressant discussion has yanked me out of my normal lurk mode.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Antidepressants are very interesting in Extropian terms--basically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are a primitive form of self-modification, and all the issues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about modifying oneself show up in one way or another in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; antidepressant arena, starting with the fact that many, if not most,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people are threatened by those of us who want to modify ourselves,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and want to be able to control or restrict this.  And just try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell a psychiatrist that *you* are in control of your treatment.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly. It is also something that can be done here and now, and leads
<BR>
to a lot of interesting and uncomfortable (for some) political
<BR>
questions. I think it is a good idea as a transhumanist to read up on
<BR>
the area even if you don't use any psychopharmacology yourself, in
<BR>
order to familiarise oneself with the issues, some prevalent memes and
<BR>
strategies, so that when the real bombshells start to appear we are
<BR>
ready to do some serious debating.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The stimulant analogy connects for me to the &quot;Prozac poop-out effect&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that many people experience at around seven years on SSRIs.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seemingly SSRIs are hard for the body's homeostatic mechanisms to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work around.  Maybe it even takes seven years.  Which would make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heck of a lot of sense because the speculated mechanism whereby you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develop a tolerance for SSRIs is that you actually prune connections,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; losing synapses to get the data rates (where?) back to where they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to be.  Scary stuff.  There just aren't any long term studies. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, there are some studies like Benmansour S, Cecchi M, Morilak DA,
<BR>
Gerhardt GA, Javors MA, Gould GG, Frazer A Effects of chronic
<BR>
antidepressant treatments on serotonin transporter function, density,
<BR>
and mRNA level.  J Neurosci 1999 Dec 1;19(23):10494-501 (SSRIs
<BR>
decreased the amount of serotonin transporter in chronically treated
<BR>
rats, but not the serotonin levels in the hippocampus). But long-term
<BR>
human data is of course only possible to get after a long time.
<BR>
<P>I have not seen any papers about synaptic loss with SSRIs though.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Exactly how bad do the drug companies want to prove that you lose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; synapses?   I was pretty worried about being expected to be a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sheep and take high doses of SSRIs as permanent maintenance for life.
</EM><BR>
<P>The drug companies might dislike it, but you can make a scientific
<BR>
career out of discovering such an effect. There is a thriving
<BR>
scientific cottage industry of analysing side effects, just check
<BR>
Medline.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think that you can push the brain around with strong drugs, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they aren't the answer for life, partly because of tolerance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development, but also because there's no learning in a drug, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depression appears to be a learned thing, which has serious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; biochemical effects on you, but those effects aren't the cause.
</EM><BR>
<P>Depression may be multifactorial, and some forms due to a serotonin
<BR>
weakness and some other forms due to bad learning. Cognitive therapy
<BR>
seems to do well with depression just because it helps the patients to
<BR>
learn to cope with the everyday problems that might otherwise trigger
<BR>
a new depressive episode; the drugs are however often necessary to get
<BR>
the patient into a state where therapy might be helpful. 
<BR>
<P>The interesting question is what happens if/when we get smart drugs
<BR>
that actually do have learning effects. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My theory is that the brain chemistry changes are how the evolved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depression mechanism gets its results.  My thinking is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depression is a mechanism designed to allow an individual to survive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and possibly get a chance to reproduce, given serious low-status, low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pecking-order in our ancestral tribal environment.  Some of us fall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the depressed mode more easily, but everyone has the potential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to get there if pushed hard enough and long enough.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since sexual responsiveness in depression is usually strongly
<BR>
decreased, I don't think it helps reproduction at all.  I'm sceptical
<BR>
about arguments for an evolutionary &quot;meaning&quot; of depression; it
<BR>
doesn't have to be a feature, just a weakness that ordinarily doesn't
<BR>
matter much.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My experience is that &quot;attack&quot; dosages of 2 to 3X the max spec'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dosage of SSRIs can significantly impact acute despair in 4 to 8
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hours, but I'm not a doctor and that's playing with fire.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal experience of mine has never been confirmed in another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person, so I could very well be off base here.  I'd really like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see research on this, though, because it would be nice to have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; powerful tool to pull people back from the brink.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know much about it (being more of a memory person than a
<BR>
psychopharmacology person), but one possibility is a serotonin peak
<BR>
due to near total reuptake blockade, combined with a very likely
<BR>
strong placebo effect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; St. John's Wort, an herb available as capsules at most any health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; food store, has significant SSRI effects.   For some reason, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact doesn't seem to get into press much.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it is often touted as &quot;natural&quot; and hence, in the opinion of
<BR>
many, &quot;safe&quot;. Besides, it is not really that selective either. I guess
<BR>
that the low dosages most people take just make the side effects less
<BR>
obvious.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oh, one parting note about SSRI's (or any effective antidepressant,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually) and suicide or violence.   Take someone who is essentially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely disabled by depression.  Stimulate the heck out of some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their neural pathways with a drug.  They aren't collapsed on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couch anymore.  They actually could carry out suicide plans that were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably beyond them in the totally depressed state.  The same goes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for taking action against someone else.  I've not read anything about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this, but I have spoken to several clinicians who regard this as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant risk of SSRIs, and give it as a reason why they always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start patients with low doses. 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is overall a problem in treating depression using any
<BR>
means. Suicides tend to occur when they are making progress, rather
<BR>
than in the descending or deepest depression. Very sad. 
<BR>
<P><P>I think one of the first things I will do when I get the chance to
<BR>
redesign my brain is to fix the monoaminergic systems - they are far
<BR>
too important and pervasive to be allowed to run without good
<BR>
supervision and optimisation. Evolution has just optimised them to
<BR>
work well enough on average in the entire population, not well enough
<BR>
in me as an individual.
<BR>
<P>Demand accountability of the catecholamines!
