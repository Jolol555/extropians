<EM>&gt; &gt; Are you guys really have problems finding dates outside of the

perceive

<EM>&gt; No, that was not it at all, and it seems like some people are just making

<P>This much, I agree with.  After seeing the flurry of notes about this topic,
<BR>
I regret responding at all.
<BR>
<P>I meant to exaggerate the implications of your and Lee's words to show how
<BR>
they could be misinterpreted.  I expected you two to clarify your
<BR>
statements.  Unfortunately, many people took offense (interestingly enough
<BR>
for a number of different reasons) before you had a chance to respond.
<BR>
<P>I apologize to both of you for fueling the fire on this one.  For the
<BR>
record, I don't believe there was any bigotry or meanness intended by either
<BR>
of you.  I regret appearing to be part of the lynch-mob.
