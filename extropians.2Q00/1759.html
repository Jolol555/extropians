<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; When industries are heavily invested in current technologies to increase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  production, and market demand suddenly drops by a large margin, you will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  wind up with many bankrupt companies (whose market value has evaporated)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and many displaced employees. The high enemployment and the loss of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  capital value both can cause severe economic turmoil if that industry is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a large enough sector of the economy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Your point is well made.  I don't want to pull a &quot;gotcha&quot; on you but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; normally that doesn't happen.  Henry Ford made his first auto around 1905 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as late as 1945 I saw horses being used for everyday transportation of goods.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  By that time they were used infrequently but it took that long to phase them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I am trying to come up with a massive change in a major industry and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; closest I can come is the switch from vinyl records to CDs.  However that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seemed to take five or ten years and it doesn't qualify as a major industry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in my mind.
</EM><BR>
<P>Most major disruptions where markets are drastically altered up to this point
<BR>
have typically been due to government action, like the ending of grain exports,
<BR>
the imposition of the luxury tax on boats, the firing of all air controllers,
<BR>
Clinton's ending of logging on federal land in the pacific northwest.
<BR>
<P>These are all examples that only impact a few sectors of the economy, but when an
<BR>
area is very dependent on one sector, it can be devastating. As anyone in Oregon
<BR>
what the logging bans were like on the economy of Oregon. The logging ban was
<BR>
essentially a deal cut between Clinton's election campaign and Weyerhauser as a
<BR>
scheme to make Clinton look like he cared about the environment, while
<BR>
Weyerhauser, the largest private landowner in the Northwest, was able to get the
<BR>
government to put all of its independent competitors out of business. Many towns
<BR>
had 50% unemployment or higher as a result. It took a few years for many of those
<BR>
people to find new lines of work, and many are still unemployed.
<BR>
<P>Any disruptions caused by new technologies making old industries obsolete, such
<BR>
as will be caused by portable fusion, nanotech, etc. will dwarf those described
<BR>
above.
