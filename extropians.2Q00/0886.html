<P><EM>&gt;Can I add something to my original question?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;I think that (real, true) works of art (paintings, sculptures, etc.) last 
</EM><BR>
for ever and ever. Meaningful. Timeless.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;That is, in my opinion, a sort of supreme, old, Extropy. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Hi - I am a painter and artist, and would like to respond to your ideas. 
<BR>
&nbsp;I have been away, but it has been called to my attention that this subject 
<BR>
has come up, so here I go again.....
<BR>
<P>****
<BR>
The assertion that &quot;real&quot;, art must be an object is wrong. Extropic art 
<BR>
eschews the rigid idea of art as object and explores various forms of 
<BR>
creativity, bioengineering, performance, conceptual art, virtual reality, new 
<BR>
film media, nanotechnology, ideas, etc., as valid mediums. It must.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt;What is not a work of art has (just) a temporary appeal, beauty, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interest, meaning. Or is handicraft…. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Not true.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twentieth century music and art's most invigorating element was it's very 
<BR>
changeability and cultural liquidity. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snobbery in art is a result of illiteracy of the general populace. Images 
<BR>
today are omnipresent.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are bombarded daily with High and Low Art - and our eyes are VERY 
<BR>
different from they were in the mid fifteenth century. We have been literally 
<BR>
cortex reconfigured to accommodate far more information than ever.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, 21st century explorations of slippery new mediums will 
<BR>
increase the mutability of design and problem solving, causing artists to 
<BR>
become more inventive, imaginative and spontaneous than ever. This is the 
<BR>
challenge and the excitement about art these days!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Laws, principles of science are timeless, meaningful, for ever? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  After Popper (and Einstein, etc.) I’m not sure.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art &amp; Science. Digital mediums for creative minds. Created by and for a 
<BR>
new breed of cross-pollinating meme spreaders.  Quite literally by the time 
<BR>
one has mastered a program well enough to express one's ideas, it is time to 
<BR>
learn a new one. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am once again mystified that once more, on this list of &quot;futurists&quot;, 
<BR>
when art is brought up we are still talking about sappy smiling cross dresser 
<BR>
Mona Lisa and her ancient armless cousin the Venus De Milo. 
<BR>
<P>Question: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why be five centuries behind in one's information about art while thirty 
<BR>
years ahead in one's ideas about science?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So art is timeless (lasts for ever) because is qualitative, but not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  merely subjective. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Science laws are quantitative, objective, but not final.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  And – interesting enough -  in art and in science we can often 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  identify exactly the same philosophical “input”. 
</EM><BR>
<P>It is true that exceptional art and music does bridge cultural and time 
<BR>
barriers, and carries the user into a new consciousness which can prepare the 
<BR>
mind for the future and for the upheavals that the new technologies and 
<BR>
scientific discoveries will bring upon our cultures.
<BR>
<P>However this does not imply timelessness, but timeliness, in other word, good 
<BR>
art is of our time and for our time, yet perhaps a bit *ahead* of it's time.
<BR>
<P>Love and Plebiscites, 
<BR>
Nadia
