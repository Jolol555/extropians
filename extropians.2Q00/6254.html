<EM>&gt; &gt; without a head the missile may still be moving towards the last

<EM>&gt; Just the expensive stuff the zoomies get.  The cheap stuff us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ground-pounders got needed active guidance the whole way (TOW 2, which I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty sure is still in use).

<P><P>My unit was light infantry, so we didn't have any anti-armor capability
<BR>
(and little access to support as well).  Therefore our primary defense
<BR>
against armor was traveling in terrain that armor has difficulty
<BR>
traversing.  Actually, due to the specialized nature of my unit's mission,
<BR>
we typically had enough explosive with us (and the know-how) to make life
<BR>
very unpleasant for armor in the sub-optimal (for armor) terrain that we
<BR>
typically worked in.
<BR>
<P>I don't think armor is likely to become outdated any time soon.
<BR>
Battlefields factors will still be mobility, guidance/fire control
<BR>
capability, hardness/armor, firepower, and logistics requirements.  A
<BR>
modern military needs many different tools that are optimized for
<BR>
different types of battlefield environments, and the MBT adds a useful and
<BR>
unique feature set to the toolbox.  However, in cases of decisive air
<BR>
superiority by either side, the necessity of the tank becomes
<BR>
significantly diminished.
