<EM>&gt; I'd like to see a little monitor associated with every living organism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the planet.  It can watch out that they don't reproduce too quickly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and otherwise control or guide it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I recall Clifford Simak's story in his collection City, where intelligent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dogs have inherited the earth and are trying to bring peace to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; animal kingdom, the lion lying down with the lamb.  Predation is a hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem to solve honorably for all parties concerned, but I think it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worth trying.  Every day, billions of animals die in suffering and pain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as their desperate struggles to escape a predator fail.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nature is screwed up.  It's a bloodthirsty, vicious world.  We should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to do better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh PLEASE.
<BR>
<P>I really don't want to get into a debate about this, but here goes:
<BR>
<P>Predation is not a 'problem'. Its a solution. It weeds out the weak and
<BR>
ill and aged. It is THE instrument of evolution. Predation IS nature at
<BR>
work. Predation is most certainly NOT bloodthirsty. Predators do not
<BR>
kill more than they need to, and viciousness is a human sentiment.
<BR>
Animals are not concerned with being mean, or causing pain and
<BR>
suffering, they are interested in FOOD. The only reason you don't feel
<BR>
the same way about herbivores is that plants can't make noise to object
<BR>
when they are eaten or flee from their consumers, even though studies
<BR>
have shown that plants object just as much to being damaged or
<BR>
destroyed. Eating plants versus eating animals is ethically no
<BR>
different, both are harvesting the body of another living thing for
<BR>
one's own sustenance.
<BR>
<P>I imagine you are probably a vegetarian, or possibly a meat eater who
<BR>
hasn't the guts to either quit meat or else participate in the
<BR>
harvesting of meat yourself. I can respect a vegetarian for their
<BR>
beliefs, no matter how wrong, but the latter is the height of hypocricy.
<BR>
The only problem with vegetarians is they get to eating plants so much
<BR>
they start to think like they are a member of the herd, just one more
<BR>
cow or sheep, rather than thinking like the top animal in the ecology.
<BR>
<P>Its rather hilarious for me to see people who are both vegetarians and
<BR>
who claim they are environmentalists but express disgust for the laws of
<BR>
nature, they don't see the inconsistency.
<BR>
<P>As I've said before here, when people started talking about having skin
<BR>
of solar cells to eliminate the need to eat, that I expect when such
<BR>
people are created that they'll pretty quickly form a PETOP, the People
<BR>
for the Ethical Treatment Of Plants. They'll call vegetarians inhumane
<BR>
butchers and disgusting bloodthirsty immoral barbarians. But thats only
<BR>
because they are now thinking like plants....
