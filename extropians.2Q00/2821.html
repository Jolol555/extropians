<P>
As is the case with many people who heard this news, I didn't know
<BR>
Sasha personally.  I only know what he's written that I've read.  I've
<BR>
been through most if not all of his website, and remember him being one
<BR>
of the more active - yet at the same time amongst the most well-spoken -
<BR>
members of a few mailing lists which I've also taken part in over the
<BR>
years.
<BR>
<P>I archive the extropians-digest messages each day.  I also subscribe
<BR>
to the real-time list in case I want to take part in a conversation.
<BR>
Usually I don't, but I do keep a screenful or so of messages from the
<BR>
list which speak to whatever's on my mind - musings, projects, intellectual
<BR>
twists which hadn't occured to me.
<BR>
<P>When Max's sad annoucement came across, I had two messages from Sasha
<BR>
on that short list.
<BR>
<P>It's very odd to have in front of you artifacts of communication that were
<BR>
supposed to be in realtime and ephermal - and also have an announcement of
<BR>
that person's passing, at the same time in the same collection.  This is
<BR>
the second time something like this has hit me in my electronic existence
<BR>
and I hope never to get used to it.
<BR>
<P>Two things hit me when Max's message came across.
<BR>
<P>The first was probably the same reaction anyone would feel.  Something along
<BR>
the lines of &quot;Oh, no.&quot;, and a pang of loss - even though I didn't know
<BR>
him as a flesh-and-blood person yet, I knew his work, and as life goes
<BR>
on it's likely I would have met him at some point.
<BR>
<P>The second was, &quot;That shouldn't happen.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This to me was a shocking response; the idea that death itself could be
<BR>
thought of as &gt;wrong&lt; - unnatural, tragic - in the particular way of
<BR>
misfortune, not as an inevitability.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to think that's the most powerful message any transhumanist could
<BR>
leave behind.  I'll remember Sasha this way.
<BR>
<P>Death to death.
