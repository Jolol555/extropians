<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ActiveX components are simply Windows executables. Making a runtime for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them would basically mean making a runtime to allow Windows programs to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; run on other OS's. This is *not* a simple task, and not one Microsoft is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; willing to allow (they refuse to document the APIs, hence everything has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to be reverse-engineered).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What alternate universe are we talking about here? I know it can't be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real world, because I currently have on my hard drive a complete set of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft  documentation for pretty much the entire Windows API set. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't quite give this away, but they come pretty close - it's only a couple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hundred dollars a year for a complete subscription.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Obviously they don't completely document every possible bug, side effect or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unsupported call in existence, but that isn't because there is some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conspiracy to keep it secret. Rather, it is because they only have so much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money to spend on developer outreach. The information they do make available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is far more complete that the docs I used to work with for Unix and Mac
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; APIs, and about as good as I would ever expect to see for a product that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes substantially every few years.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, but his reality is a lot closer than yours.  As a former Microsoft
<BR>
employee involved in O/S work (NT 3.1 in my case), I agree that there was
<BR>
never any specific intent to hide APIs from application developers.
<BR>
Indeed, Microsoft donated office space in its own building for various
<BR>
application developers to work with APIs under development. 
<BR>
<P>But at the same time, it was clear that this benefit was extended only to
<BR>
application developers that increased the share of Microsoft's OS
<BR>
business.  Free software devlopers need not apply, and developers of
<BR>
competing APIs like WINE were clearly unwelcome.  Word Perfect got
<BR>
support; the little guys didn't.  It was also clear that if one of the
<BR>
MS application or compiler groups needed a new API for something, adding
<BR>
it and getting it to work was a much higher priority than telling anyone
<BR>
else about it (which we'd get around to eventually).
<BR>
<P>And ActiveX is another ball of wax entirely--it was, from its very
<BR>
inception, intended to subvert the current de fact standards of the web
<BR>
to increase the use of less-flexible Microsoft products.  I may be on
<BR>
Mike's side in the Anti-trust issue, but his recent posts about things
<BR>
like ActiveX are clueless.  It was never intended to be secure, or open,
<BR>
or interoperable, or implementable by anyone else or on any hardware--it
<BR>
was designed to do Microsoft-like things on Intel-like hardware, nothing
<BR>
more and nothing less.  Comparing ActiveX to Java is just marketing hype
<BR>
with no relationship to reality.  I happen to think that attempting to
<BR>
undermine public standards is a perfectly legitimate business tactic if
<BR>
you can pull it off; but I certainly won't argue that MS didn't intend
<BR>
to do exactly that.
<BR>
<P>In fact, it disappoints me that the other Microsoft case (v. Sun) gets
<BR>
no press, because that one is a great example of two things: (1) That a
<BR>
competitor succeeded in creating a freely-available cross-platform
<BR>
standard that really worked and that gained popular acceptance at the
<BR>
expense of Microsoft, and succeeded so completely that Microsoft signed
<BR>
a contract clearly agreeing to abide by the standard--in short, Sun won,
<BR>
and demonstrated that monopoly power can be overcome. And (2), it shows
<BR>
an example of Microsoft actually doing something wrong, by violating
<BR>
their own signed contract to abide by the standard.  This is not like
<BR>
anti-trust case where they only violated silly rules the government
<BR>
imposed on them, but a case of them willingly taking on an obligation
<BR>
and then breaking the deal.  For /that/ they should be drawn and
<BR>
quartered, not for the stupid anti-trust stuff.
