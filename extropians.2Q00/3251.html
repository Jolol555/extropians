</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    IAN: What the VDS report fails to address is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    the multiplicity of flashes in fixed locations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    which is the linchpin of the &quot;gunshot&quot; diagnosis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    In one rotation of Mt Carmel by the FLIR aircraft,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    around 20 shots can be counted in one fixed location.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If there were some broken glass at that fixed location, you might well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expect to see multiple flashes as you move around it.  This seems to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what the VDS report describes.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Rather than reiterating Part II:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir03.htm">http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir03.htm</A>
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;    Bursts of flashes occur in a mechanical rhythm of 7
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    to 10 times per second, like the cyclic rate of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    machinegun.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;VDS does not discuss this phenomenon, and I'm not sure why.  It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possible that the pattern is not as rhythmic and mechanical as some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have led us to believe.  There could also be artifacts introduced in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the processing, copying and digitizing of the tape.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: I could just as well argue that whatever
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gets the Govt off is an artifact of processing.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the FLIR, flash patterns are rhythmic.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;    They are also linear and pointed toward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    Mt Carmel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't think so.  The pixels are very wide, either due to image
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;degradation or the behavior of the camera.  From certain angles, this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;makes the pixels appear to be linear and oriented toward the compound.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And for some reason the flashes are mostly seen from those angles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Are there any instances where there are linear flashes which are in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;vertical direction on screen?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Observe the distribution of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points where these shots are visible:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir03.gif">http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir03.gif</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The linear shape of the flashes point
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at Mt Carmel consistently throughout
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the aircraft's motion, so the shape of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first shots are just about at 90
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;degrees on the screen to the shape of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the last shots. This indicates that the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape is not an artifact of the monitor.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, hot embers flying off Mt Carmel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are seen on the screen as circular,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indicating again that the elongation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the flashes is not a distortion, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the embers would also be elongated, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore the FLIR is true to the shape
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of things down to the very smallest dots.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;    The VDS report fails to include the rate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    of flashes in fixed locations as a critical flash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    attribute in their attribute comparison of the test-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    FLIR to the 1993 FLIR.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is true.  However we would need to see the test footage shot last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;month to see whether this is actually a gunfire attribute.  VDS used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this footage to establish their criteria.  Maybe real gunfire does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;show such patterns.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Think about it, one gunshot will show
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up as one flash (this is no longer disputed),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thus two shots will show two flashes, and thus
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a series of shots will be a series of flashes.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to see the VDS tape, but it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seems that reliable science needs to be secret.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;    VDS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    also fails to offer any explanation for how there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    could be multiple solar reflections in fixed locations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;On the contrary, this is one of their biggest arguments in favor of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the sun reflection theory.  In some cases there are multiple flashes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in fixed locations over a prolonged interval (many minutes) while the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;visible light images show reflective material at that exact location.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Can you show me those visible-light
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;images that show reflective material in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the locations? Flashes are separated by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many minutes but by fractions of a second.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;    However, in my recent report on the Waco FLIR I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    explore several explanations for how solar reflections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    might duplicate the rapid flashes seen on the FLIR,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    and one just might do it. But counter explanations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    either fail or are far less likely explanations for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    rapid flashes on the FLIR than that they are gunshots,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    which is further supported by whistle-blower testimony
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    that there was a gunfight around the back of Mt Carmel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    See why the rapid flashes are most logically gunshots:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    Part I: <A HREF="http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir02.htm">http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir02.htm</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    Part II: <A HREF="http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir03.htm">http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir03.htm</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think if you look at the last figure in your flir02 URL above,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you see right there a strong argument for the sun reflection theory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;All the flash observations are clustered together in the left side of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the diagram.  It's true, they aren't right on top of each other, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you'd expect some variation due to uneven ground.  This clustering is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hard to explain if it is gunfire.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: I reject the idea that about 20,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1-by-3-foot pieces of glass laying at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angles that would allow their beams to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strike the plane one after the other
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could also occupy the same location.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, those shots appear to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the shadow of the building. I'll
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;check this detail again to see if so.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;(I believe you suggested that the building would have blocked view of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;shooters&quot; from other directions, but it didn't look to me like there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was that much obstruction.  The camera was high overhead and looking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;down at a steep angle.)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: There are dozens of rotations of Mt
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carmel, there is never a view of the spot
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in question from the other side. Here's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a view of Mt Carmel from the other side:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/fire01.jpg">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/fire01.jpg</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is the east side. Notice that the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aircraft is looking at Mt Carmel from an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angle. Now, pieces of glass could lay on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ground such that they refelect solar
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radiation back toward the sun, and thus
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtually no angle need be immune from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the possibility of seeing a reflection.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Keep in mind, too, that VDS also attributed a number of flashes to heat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the hot underside of the tanks reflecting from debris on the ground.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Ya, and Vector Data also implies
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have no conflict of interest since
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their British office never contracted
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directly with the US Government, even
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though Vector Data Systems, which is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;headquartered in Alexandria, VA, works
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for US military intelligence and is a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member of the National Military Intelligence

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the axiom &quot;power corrupts&quot; is a reliable axiom,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the Official Story must be suspect on its face.
