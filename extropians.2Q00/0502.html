</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; terrorist situation I see that makes any sense is an &quot;irrational&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; scenario where individuals are motiviated by beliefs and not by needs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Though there are plenty of those around.  But is it easy to learn GNR
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when your mindset puts your beliefs ahead of rationality?  Genetics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alone insists that there is not an absolute difference between humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and other primates.  Those who insist that Diety created humans from mud
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would reject that, and be unable to proceed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, not entirely.  I've known very bright rational people who still
<BR>
profess belief in a Diety.  That never stopped them from writing a
<BR>
Ph.D. thesis, publishing papers, doing experiments, etc.  However,
<BR>
it may be true that &quot;rational&quot; beliefs in a Diety also serve as
<BR>
a disincentive to commit those types of acts with GNR that would
<BR>
produce horrific results (assuming no nanodefenses existed).
<BR>
<P>The real threats are those where the beliefs involve a fair degree
<BR>
of emotional 'berserker' mentality where you produce a lot of synthetic
<BR>
hatred and desires to destroy different &quot;tribes&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For those who know enough to take advantage of future tech, there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potential for boundless resources, given time.  But at any specific date
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the future, there will always be a finite number of people aware of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the realities of nano, and a finite amount of time between now and then.
</EM><BR>
<P>But there is a relatively long lead time up to nano (10's of years),
<BR>
during which people will become aware of what it can do for them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Unlimited production does not mean immediately infinite supply, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter how much we wish it were otherwise.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, but once you have real &quot;almost anything&quot; boxes, you do get to the
<BR>
&quot;infinite supply&quot; position for most human needs relatively quickly.
<BR>
It is only a matter of days to give everyone alive an AA box.  This
<BR>
is obvious if you think about the doubling times.  The mass doubling
<BR>
times for AA boxes are of the order of hours.  The mass doubling times
<BR>
for humans are of the order of months to years.   Its only when humans
<BR>
can be copied with the ease of computer files that the balance of the
<BR>
equation shifts back to the side where consumption may exceed production.
<BR>
<P>As I've pointed out previously, building things with large mass (houses,
<BR>
yachts, etc.) will take months to years (unless you borrow replicators
<BR>
from your friends), but in general unless you are satisfied with the
<BR>
the generic, open source, 100 meter yacht, the design times will be
<BR>
greater than the build times.  It wasn't a lack of *resources* that
<BR>
made the Gates House a ~2-3 years project.  This will only change
<BR>
if we get some really &quot;intelligent&quot; design software.
