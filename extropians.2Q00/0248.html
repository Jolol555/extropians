&lt; This may seem at first to be a good strategy but the problem is we will 
<BR>
need 
<BR>
&nbsp;the support of the 'comfortable thinkers' to advance our agenda for the 
<BR>
&nbsp;achievement of superlongevity because of negative public attitudes which may 
<BR>
&nbsp;form, spurred on by certain influential special interest groups. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John, I think you have brought up a consideration that must be taken into 
<BR>
account even as we proceed on our own without waiting for anyone.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to cite chapter and verse of pressure groups opposing 
<BR>
new ideas, or even old ideas, with varying degrees of success all is 
<BR>
necessary is to read a daily newspaper for a short while.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMHO, let us go ahead with attempts to neutralize or even recruit the 
<BR>
average man to our cause.  However let us also note the lack of success other 
<BR>
worthy causes have had; example, the effort to get people out to vote.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime it appears that a great deal of the life extension effort 
<BR>
is being carried on by private efforts motivated by people that want to live 
<BR>
longer and have the capital to finance their program.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition there seems to be research financed by the government.  I met 
<BR>
a young lady doing research on a portion of the telemerase (spelling?) 
<BR>
problem.  In her mind she was working on a problem contributing to her Ph.D. 
<BR>
and I don't believe she was really aware of the implications of what she was 
<BR>
doing.  Or maybe she didn't want me to be aware of the implications of her 
<BR>
research? :)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if we can take the statements of present day researchers at face 
<BR>
value we have methods that will provide us major life extension available now 
<BR>
at reasonably low cost.  My concern is to evaluate existing programs and use 
<BR>
any knowledge that passes the test.  I imagine that is also the concern of 
<BR>
many others.  Can you help us?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also said: &quot;As for the Bell Curve, the book's point about the 
<BR>
intelligent congregating together in communities and work as the 'nobility of 
<BR>
a meritocracy' does make sense to me but other things about that book were 
<BR>
very flawed.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't imagine any book as densely packed with statistics as THE BELL 
<BR>
CURVE not being flawed to one extent or another.  To give an almost trivial 
<BR>
example can you imagine that any of the popular world almanacs don't contain 
<BR>
errors of fact?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However two things should be noted:
<BR>
1.  The major thrust of the book is the congregation of the Cognitive Elite 
<BR>
(the authors term, not mine) and no one to my knowledge has seriously 
<BR>
challenged that.
<BR>
2.  The challenges that have come concerned secondary issues.  Those 
<BR>
challenges have been discussed online and in literature.  Those that want to 
<BR>
study those issues can go straight to the sources.  They don't need me to 
<BR>
give my second hand interpretation.
<BR>
John, thank you for your response
<BR>
Ron Harrison.
