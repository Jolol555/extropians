It appears as if Billy Brown &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bbrown@transcient.com?Subject=Re:%20what%20if%20microsoft%20disobeyed%20the%20breakup?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200006080539.HAA24158@color.sics.se&gt;">bbrown@transcient.com</A>&gt; wrote:

<P>Just as I can much ignore the funny laws of the borganism United States,
<BR>
you can ignore the funny laws of any corporation you don't work for.
<BR>
But inside a borganism, you have to adhere to their rules or its members
<BR>
will make your life problematic.  Inside a State, they can even kill you.
<BR>
Inside a corporation, you can be expelled, or they can sue you for breaking
<BR>
their contract.
<BR>
<P>In locations where one corporation becomes the main employer, to be expelled
<BR>
can become a mighty threat. Yes, you can respond with the &quot;US - Like it or
<BR>
leave it.&quot;, but I don't consider that an argument, really. :-/
<BR>
<P>|The only thing companies can do now that they couldn't do in a pure
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<P>Yes, in a _pure_ one. We don't discuss that here, do we? As I pointed out,
<BR>
anarcho-capitalism works _less_ well outside an anacho-capitalistic
<BR>
society. And I cannot se any such around anywhere at the moment. So...
<BR>
<P>So how to create an anarcho-capitalistic society?  Suggestions, please.
