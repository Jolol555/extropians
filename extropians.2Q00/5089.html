Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We studied the effect of the extract of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wine phenolics (EWP) on blood pressure,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vasorelaxing activity and aortic biomechanical properties in stroke-prone
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Thirty-six 4-week-old male SHRSP/Izm rats were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;divided into 6 equal groups fed one of the following 6 diets: A control diet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(plain laboratory diet), the control diet substituted with 0.5 or 1.0%
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;polyphenolic compounds derived from the extract of apple
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;phenolics (EAP), the control diet substituted with 0.5 or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.0% polyphenolic compounds derived from the extract of tea
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;phenolics (ETP), or the control diet along with drinking
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;water containing 1.0% polyphenolic compounds derived from EWP. Systolic blood
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pressure (SBP) and body weight (BW) were checked once a week. At the end of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the 8th week of feeding, all of the rats were sacrificed and the heart weight
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and aortic biomechanical properties were measured. The relaxation effect of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the addition of EWP on endothelium-intact aortic rings precontracted with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha was also measured. Only EWP, not EAP or ETP,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significantly lowered the SBP values a compared with the control group at the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4th, 7th and 8th weeks of feeding (p &lt; 0.05). The heart weight and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ventricular weight, expressed as the percentage of BW, were significantly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lower in the EWP group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). The aortic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;maximum stress was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05), and the aortic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;incremental elastic modulus was significantly reduced (meaning higher
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;elasticity) (p &lt; 0.001) in the EWP group as compared with the control group.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The aortic rings showed concentration-dependent relaxation induced by EWP,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and the relaxation was significantly greater than that induced by a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;commercial red wine preparation. In conclusion, EWP
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;attenuated the elevation of blood pressure in SHRSP possibly by increasing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the vasorelaxation activity. The aortic fragility and elasticity were also
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;improved in EWP-fed SHRSP.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional note by poster:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green tea phenolics have increased lifespan in SHRSP dramatically. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect on longevity of wine phenolics have not been tested yet.
