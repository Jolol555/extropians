A couple of other studies suggest that these are not the flying rubble piles 
<BR>
we feared, but the jury is still out. In fact a giant rubble pile may never 
<BR>
have caused an extinction even like 65 million years ago, or 250 million 
<BR>
years ago. Best understanding is that these are pretty dense objects,  iron 
<BR>
based, rather then silica of carbonaceous. Time will tell. Also, the concept 
<BR>
is to set a nuke plasma blast in front of or alongside the killer Roid' to 
<BR>
nudge it away for a few decades--buying us time to develop ion drive pushers. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Never on top of the offending asteroid or inside, as depicted in Deep Impact 
<BR>
or Armageddon.

<P>&lt;&lt; These Pollyannas are presumptuous.  They assume that asteroids are hard,
<BR>
&nbsp;cohesive objects that will be shoved aside by a few megatons of explosive
<BR>
&nbsp;energy.  There are two things wrong with this idea, and these reveal how
<BR>
&nbsp;radically our ideas about the nature of asteroids have changed in just
<BR>
&nbsp;10 years.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;First, most astronomers will now agree that asteroids are orbiting rubble
<BR>
&nbsp;piles rather than monolithic objects.  For example, the near-earth
<BR>
&nbsp;asteroid Mathilde, 53 kilometers in diameter, has a density of only
<BR>
&nbsp;1.3 grams/cubic centimeter.  Its porosity must be greater than 50%.
<BR>
&nbsp;It is not a hard, coherent object.  Instead of a bullet, it is more
<BR>
&nbsp;like a cloud of shotgun pellets.  It would be hard to divert all this
<BR>
&nbsp;debris with a nuclear blast.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;[Photo/sketch caption]:
<BR>
&nbsp;Many asteroids are really probably only plum-puddings of accreted debris.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;To make matters worse, asteroids like Mathilde are stickier than a cloud
<BR>
&nbsp;of buckshot.  This fact is deduced from photos of asteroids showing many
<BR>
&nbsp;to be marked by huge craters.  (Mathilde has one 33 kilometers wide.)
<BR>
&nbsp;K.R. Housen et al, using laboratory tests and scaling data, argue that
<BR>
&nbsp;asteroid craters were not blasted out by collision.  (Mathilde is not
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;shattered&quot; as one would expect given such a huge crater.)  Rather, the
<BR>
&nbsp;craters are &quot;dents&quot; instead of holes!  Cosmic rubble piles are like
<BR>
&nbsp;sponges.  Collisions with other rubble piles result in compression of the
<BR>
&nbsp;target surface and accretion of the smaller object.  In effect, asteroids
<BR>
&nbsp;are energy absorbers and will hardly be fazed by a nuclear detonation.
