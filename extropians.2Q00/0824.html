<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ahem: I _strongly_ suggest you go and read up on the history of The Bloody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Code (the English legal system enforced during the 18th century). It has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; some ominous warnings for those who believe in mandatory sentencing and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; draconian punishment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       :
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So if we get rid of all gun control laws, people will stop using guns in crimes?????
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You're deliberately misrepresenting my statements (which in any event are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not a comment on gun control, in either direction) about the unwisdom of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imposing mandatory draconian punishments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Either that, or you didn't bother to pause and consider whether or not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what you were reading meant what you thought it meant, or something else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I repeat (in a nutshell): imposing harsher punishments doesn't necessarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reduce crime levels; it may actually impede the process of achieving a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conviction. In general, crime rates go down when the perceived probability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of conviction is high -- regardless of how serious the punishment is --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because people only commit crimes *when they don't expect to get caught*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's no good legislating to hang people for stealing a loaf of bread if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can't arrest anybody for the offense; bread thefts will continue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because the perceived risk of arrest is zero. On the other hand, if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; punishment is a fine of about twice the value of a loaf of bread, _but_
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there's a 95% arrest and conviction rate, only a total idiot would even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consider stealing a loaf.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Unfortunately the US legislative system seems currently to have a bias
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in favour of draconian punishment over reliable arrest and conviction.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Arrests are pretty good in many areas. The big hole is in the
<BR>
prosecution. Defendants are allowed to bollux up the process with
<BR>
objections and appeals that prosecutors are highly encoruaged by penny
<BR>
pinching politicians to plea bargain all cases but those that can be
<BR>
used to the maximum benefit of the careers of the politicians or the
<BR>
prosecutors. Trails cost money. Therefore, prosecutors plea bargain away
<BR>
most cases to lesser charges, and the perp is back on the street in no
<BR>
time. Additinally, because the mandatory sentencing is uneven, with
<BR>
regard to drug crimes versus violent crimes, violent criminals are
<BR>
released to make room for drug criminals.
<BR>
<P>Another contributor is the whole minority thing, as  it impacts the
<BR>
arrest rate. Many minorities, because of real or perceived
<BR>
discrimination by police, tend to be highly uncooperative with police
<BR>
when police are investigating crimes. Even when the crime is against one
<BR>
of their own, if they know the perp is also one of their own they won't
<BR>
cooperate with investigators. As a result, this does retard the arrest
<BR>
rate where it does occur (and curiously its indicative of high crime
<BR>
existing in minority areas). Your argument has some merit, but the
<BR>
broken state of our court system, and the high level of diversity in our
<BR>
culture are the major causes, IMHO.
