<EM>&gt;&gt;I'm thinking of trying to replicate the Stephen King stunt, using the new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;unpublished sf novel by me and Rory Barnes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;There are two big holes in this plan:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;everyone and her dog knows King, nobody's heard of us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;we don't have the gadgets to allow people to pay for a download.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;The first we can try to work around, but the second is an impossible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;difficulty unless we can get some cyber-savvy help. Anyone here grok this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;kind of programming? Might be best to talk to me off-line, to avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;cluttering the list.

<EM>&gt;I'm planning to release my first novel online some how or another (if I
</EM><BR>
ever
<BR>
<EM>&gt;finish it), but I'm prepared for the inevitable fact that if it becomes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;popular, it will be bootlegged.  I don't know if there is a practical way
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt;avoid that.  King's novel is now floating around Usenet (and probably other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;places as well).  If you come up with any workable solutions, please let me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know.  Thanks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Damien, maybe the trick is to not try to protect your novel too much. You
<BR>
can put in place some pay-by-credit-card stuff so that people have to pay to
<BR>
download (very simple &amp; cheap to do), but let them pirate it once it is
<BR>
downloaded (very hard and expensive to stop).
<BR>
<P>Big Steve gained some notoriety by publishing his book this way. He probably
<BR>
made some money, and lots of people read it, many because they could get it
<BR>
for free. Don't you wish that was your book &quot;floating around usenet&quot;,
<BR>
getting you lots of new readership around the world?
<BR>
<P>I assert that those people who read ripped off versions of this book, and
<BR>
like it, will be likely to buy subsequent versions. The piracy does you a
<BR>
big favour. The trick is, next time, to make it more difficult to rip off.
<BR>
If the current book gets pirated heavily and you get some decent fame out of
<BR>
the process (must be handled correctly), then some 'normous publisher might
<BR>
do the job for you next time.
<BR>
<P>You can even get on the whole &quot;information must be free&quot; bandwagon. Pretend
<BR>
you've got a big publisher breathing down your neck (perhaps you have), who
<BR>
is forcing you to *gasp* charge for your book, but that you actually support
<BR>
it being ripped off. Then, lots of net geeks like me will jump up and down
<BR>
about horrid publishing dinosaurs, and spread your book to the far corners
<BR>
of the earth. Then Damien and Rory get big time fame, and everything
<BR>
published subsequently is a gold mine.
