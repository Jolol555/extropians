<EM>&gt; Mad-Max, me-and-my-gun libertarian stuff doesn't really appeal. What I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't understand is why you're so much more afraid of big government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than big capital. What's the basis of this business good / government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad thing? It's all just power. If it weren't the US government, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be someone else. It seems to me if you randomly switch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Gnomes of Zurich&quot; and &quot;BATF&quot;, the ultra-leftist/ultra-rightist paranoias
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become indistinguishable. The fixation is the same - only the label on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the obsession changes.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The biggest difference between big business and big government is that in
<BR>
big business the power is distributed between many competing companies.
<BR>
<P>Having lived in both extremes (or at least as extreme as they get in the
<BR>
U.S.), I can say that &quot;civilization&quot; in very libertarian areas is not very
<BR>
different than &quot;civilization&quot; in more traditionally socialist areas with
<BR>
heavily delegated authority.  I've lived in areas where there was no real
<BR>
law enforcement and I can tell you that it is nothing like &quot;Mad-Max&quot;.  In
<BR>
fact, it tends to be much more civil and friendly since there is not an
<BR>
explicit power heirarchy.  Everyone minds their own business, just about
<BR>
everything is accomplished by contracts between individuals (often not
<BR>
even written), and conflicts are often arbitrated amongst the people
<BR>
themselves.  Overall, I find these societies to be exceedingly fair and
<BR>
free, whereas I often find more socialist locales to be rather arbitrary
<BR>
and capricious in their use of the power delegated by the people.  In my
<BR>
experience, the greater the distribution of power, the less abuse of
<BR>
power that occurs.  In a system of distributed power, you *have* to play
<BR>
fair, as you will never be in a position to exercise your power with
<BR>
impunity.
<BR>
<P>The argument against big government is that since they represent a highly
<BR>
centralized power, they are almost never required to play fairly and can
<BR>
exercise arbitrary power with near impunity at almost any time.
