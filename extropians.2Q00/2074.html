<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sun have produced StarOffice, which is fully compatible with MS Office
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and free for personal non-commercial use. It's distributed with several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the Linux distributions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, but its not fully comparable, feature for feature. It only has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; file format compatibility.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; For one thing, I don't see why it should have to be feature for feature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; comparable. I said it was fully compatible, by which I mean it can read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and write files in MS Office's formats such that users can use either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with no hassle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure, but WordPad can do the same in Win95, and I don't consider that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much of a word processor either.
</EM><BR>
<P>Although StarOffice does not have a feature set as wide as MS Office,
<BR>
it's certainly a lot more than WordPad, and possibly wider than some
<BR>
more simple suites like AppleWorks.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I'll leave this one or we'll go too subjective - I could push
<BR>
for Emacs being a more full-featured word processor than Word.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; One of my gripes with MS Office (I'm not saying MS shouldn't be allowed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to do this, it just annoys me) is the continual new versions. The vast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; majority of users never use 90% of the features (hence why StarOffice is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a viable alternative for many - not that it's particularly lacking in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; features itself). As soon as businesses start to upgrade, files start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; circulating in the new formats,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For doing things like writing letters, etc. you don't need many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; features. If you are doing any kind of publishing production, you HAVE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have those features.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed, but I was referring to the majority of use - which is letters,
<BR>
invoices, contracts, company documents and the like. DTP is a whole
<BR>
other ball game of course.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The 'quirky' comment I've heard elsewhere, mostly because the header
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; normally found in Debian is not present. It can be put back in with no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; problem, but the point of the Corel implementation was to make it easily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; installable by a newbie on an average desktop machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And this it does very well. Let me say that when I first saw a Corel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; system running I was *very* impressed - they had obviously put a great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; deal of work into making the interface consistent and easy to use,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; including writing a lot of their own software.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; However, when I obtained a copy and tried the install, it had problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on quite a few machines, including some with quite basic common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hardware.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could you give me a list? I deal with a few linux people at corel and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd be interested in passing along feedback... and for my own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; edification as well, as I'm debating using that release for my servers.
</EM><BR>
<P>(I've now done this briefly in another post - sorry if I shouted a bit
<BR>
in that one, btw.)
<BR>
<P>For what it's worth, I wouldn't really have advised Corel for servers -
<BR>
not on the basis of any quirks, but because it's very obviously been set
<BR>
up with the emphasis on the user-end desktop. RedHat, Debian maybe?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not someone who spreads rumours, and I'm not someone who acts with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prejudice. Any comments I make are based on my own experience and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; knowledge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ok. Its just that that particular adjective seems to be common among
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conventional linuxheads when confronted with CLOS, so I'm wondering if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everybody has just read the same review by some sourpuss.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have to admit, it has popped up a lot in a number of places. I think
<BR>
'quirky' was probably just the best word :)
