<P><EM>&gt; Actually I was thinking more of a society of people enlightened enough to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realize that what's good for the whole is good for the individual.  It's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply a matter of realizing that the surest way to keep your neighbor from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stealing your bread is to be sure that he has enough to keep his own belly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; full.  I call it &quot;enlightened self-interest.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately such a society is unlikely to be stable for long as long as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is not enough to go around for *everyone*.  But hopefully that minor 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem will soon be solved by the good folks over at Foresight :)

<P>Actually, there is enough of most stuff to go around for everybody
<BR>
today. 
<BR>
<P>A society based on enlightened self-interest can likely be stable if
<BR>
it is based on reciprocity: I scratch your back if you scratch mine,
<BR>
but if you don't, I won't. Without the conditional part, defectors
<BR>
will have an advantage - which means that people with enlightened
<BR>
self-interest would rationally support reciprocity rather than the
<BR>
simple altruism behavior. This doesn't preclude simple compassion or
<BR>
helpfulness (we often get paid back by goodwill and the nice feeling
<BR>
of doing good), but they are a dangerous basis for a society since
<BR>
they are not stable.
