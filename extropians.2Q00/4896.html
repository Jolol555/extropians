<P><EM>&gt; Sarah, I'm sure someone else will be better qualified to say what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extropian line is on human genetic engineering.  Using the Extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; principles as a guideline, I would expect Extropians to be as totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against any sort of government regulation as you are. Of course certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people will try to control the course of human genetic research--it's too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; valuable a tool to escape that.  My greatest hope is that there are people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who are obsessed enough with their research that they'll quietly continue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing it, regardless of the masses and their political leaders.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Careful!  The problem with knowledge in general (as Joy attempts to
<BR>
point out) is that it can be used for good and evil.  Part of the
<BR>
Foresight guidelines on nanotechnology is that &quot;though shalt not
<BR>
release self-replicating machines&quot; (at least not until they are
<BR>
much better understood).  Now, it goes without saying that many
<BR>
current agbio products and any genetically &quot;enhanced&quot; children
<BR>
(in which the germ cells are engineered as well) violate these
<BR>
principles.  Now, the Foresight associated people aren't running
<BR>
around screaming for government intervention (obviously), so
<BR>
the problem of balancing risks and benefits must be discussed.
<BR>
<P>In particular, I believe wise individuals (libertarian or not)
<BR>
*would* argue for government investigation and regulation, and even
<BR>
preventative or defensive preparative activities, in situations where
<BR>
the perceived risks are high.  Two examples of this come to mind --
<BR>
outcast regimes (or known sociopaths) purchasing quantities of
<BR>
equipment required for genetic engineering or an individual
<BR>
going into his doctor and arguing for hyper-testosterone/adrenaline
<BR>
genetic add-ons.  Those are cases where the possible risks to
<BR>
society seem great enough that relatively high hurdles should be
<BR>
required to protect the &quot;public good&quot;.  Now, the problem arises
<BR>
when people extend the &quot;public good&quot; to be &quot;white, blond, german&quot;
<BR>
or &quot;human insofar as all genes are from 'original' human stock&quot;,
<BR>
as there are individuals who would aruge the &quot;public&quot; may easily
<BR>
include individuals that don't match those filters.
<BR>
<P>The problem arises because people are afraid of getting on the
<BR>
slippery slope.  But we have made the transition from societies
<BR>
where individuals have 1 mother to cases where rare individuals
<BR>
have 3 mothers.  I suspect we will make similar transitions with
<BR>
regard to self-engineering as well.  The real problem with determining
<BR>
the &quot;unacceptable&quot; self-mods will be that it falls into the same
<BR>
definitional realm as pornography (you know it when you see it) --
<BR>
but we all have somewhat different filters as to what we can
<BR>
accept and as the sociologists point out, even those are likely
<BR>
to change with personal exposure.
<BR>
<P>How much you &quot;slow&quot; progress to allow the majority to catch-up
<BR>
to the technology (to prevent backlashes) or promote/require government
<BR>
regulation (or industry self-oversight) are issues we should continue
<BR>
to examine.  Obviously there is a conflict with industry profit
<BR>
motives and goals of keeping technologies out of the hands of
<BR>
international evil doers, so it is probably undesirable that
<BR>
governments be left out of the equation entirely.
<BR>
<P>I have no doubts that the research will continue.  The toolboxes
<BR>
and knowledge bases are being constructed.  Using them so that the
<BR>
net good substantially outweighs the net evil remains the challenge.
<BR>
