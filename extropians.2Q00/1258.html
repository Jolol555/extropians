<EM>&gt; &gt; proves that simulating a single neuron is not a trivial task.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Definitely not trivial. ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In most computational neuroscience models of neurons they are divided
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into compartments treated as isopotential; they are each described by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their membrane potential, the concentrations of sodium, potassium,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;calcium and sometimes chloride ions and the state of various ion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;channels. The number of compartment varies a lot, 100,000 is on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;largest scale so far - we are quite limited by our lack of really good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;morphological cell data not to mention electrophysiological data.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Other chemical processes need to be added at the synapses, especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for plasticity models. A fellow researcher made a simplified (!) model
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;involving just 30-40 chemicals (many of which were variously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;phosphorylated states of a protein) of the long term potentiation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;phenomenon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes, neurons are much more complex than simple transistors. But it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not obvious that all this complexity makes them *much* more complex -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there are clever simplifications ... described more compactly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;using a phenomenological model.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wow.  It looks like Anders has learned enough about this field to
<BR>
start to answer the questions I'm most interested in.  So let me now
<BR>
try to express my questions more clearly in the hopes of inspiring
<BR>
Anders and others to answer them.
<BR>
<P>Robert Bradbury supported Billy Brown in this thread, saying &quot;*when*
<BR>
one understands exactly what it is the neurons are `computing', you
<BR>
can develop software and hardware that do it more effectively.&quot;
<BR>
Therefore Morevac's estimates using the parts of the brain he
<BR>
understands are reasonable estimates for CPU requirements of the
<BR>
whole brain when we understand what all brain parts compute.
<BR>
<P>This argument seems correct to me, but beside the most interesting
<BR>
point.  Estimating how cheap it will be in CPU terms to simulate
<BR>
a brain &quot;eventually&quot; seems like asking how cheap anything will be
<BR>
&quot;eventually&quot; -- eventually may never come if improvement continues
<BR>
on and on, and even if eventually does come its not clear why
<BR>
that estimate is of interest now.
<BR>
<P>To me the most interesting questions are how good uploading technology
<BR>
is now, how fast it is improving, and when therefore uploading may
<BR>
be feasible.  The whole point of the uploading strategy to achieving
<BR>
artificial intelligence is to port the software of a human brain
<BR>
*without* understanding how it works.  The simplest strategy of this
<BR>
sort is to just understand how each type of neuron works, and scan a
<BR>
brain noting which neurons are of which types and are connected to
<BR>
which other neurons.
<BR>
<P>Focusing on this neuron-level strategy, I want estimates for five
<BR>
parameters.  Two are static parameters:
<BR>
<P>1) Neuron Inventory -- The number of distinct types of neurons, and
<BR>
the number of each type in a typical human brain.
<BR>
<P>3) Resolution required -- The spatial/chemical resolution of a scanning
<BR>
technology that would be required to sufficiently reliably distinguish
<BR>
between the types of neurons, and to distinguish which neurons connect
<BR>
to which others via which kinds of synapses.  (Assume one is repeated
<BR>
slicing and scanning a cryogenically frozen brain.)
<BR>
<P>Three parameters are dynamic, about *rates* of progress of these:
<BR>
<P>1) Neuron types modeled -- The fraction of neuron types for which
<BR>
we have reasonable computational models at *any* level of complexity.
<BR>
That is, where we have run such models and seen that they correspond
<BR>
reasonably closely to the behavior of actual neurons of that type.
<BR>
<P>2) Average CPU/RAM per neuron -- A weighted average across neuron
<BR>
types of the CPU/RAM requirements for simulating each neuron type.
<BR>
The weights should be according to the fraction of each type of
<BR>
neuron in a human brain.
<BR>
<P>3) Scanning costs -- The time/dollar cost per area scanned of scanning
<BR>
at the resolution required for uploading.  Costs of scanning at
<BR>
other resolutions may be interesting if time trends in them can be
<BR>
more accurately estimates, and if one can estimate a scaling
<BR>
relationship between the costs of scanning at different resolutions.
<BR>
<P><P>The progress estimate of neuron types modeled help us estimate
<BR>
when it will be possible to upload at any cost, while the other
<BR>
estimates (together with estimates of how fast CPU/RAM costs fall)
<BR>
help us estimate how fast the cost of uploading is falling with time.
<BR>
<P>Anders, tell me if I'm wrong, but it strikes me that we may well have
<BR>
enough experience modeling neurons to start to estimate these parameters.
<BR>
If so, constructing such estimates of when uploading will be feasible
<BR>
and how fast costs will fall seems a very high priority to me.
