[Non-member submission]
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Here's my thoughts on making it affordable, the intent is really to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; eliminate the supposed have/have-not 'problem': Give tax breaks to those
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; with above average or excellent genomes to donate their ova and sperm,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and absolve them of all financial responsibility for the children that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; result from such donations. At the same time, give tax incentives as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; lump sum payments to women who give birth to such individuals reflecting
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the potential reduced costs to society by them not giving birth to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; psychopaths/sociopaths/mental/physical defectives. Its a free market
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; solution to the have/have-not problem, it also won't encourage racist
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; eugenics as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not exactly.  Who does the rating?  The same kind of people who sit on
<BR>
parole
<BR>
boards or staff the FDA?
<BR>
<P>My idea is to use insurance companies.  Parents would be required to buy
<BR>
insurance on their future kids.  And these policies would pay off if the
<BR>
child
<BR>
has a horrible birth defect, ends up in jail, or on welfare.  This would
<BR>
leave
<BR>
the decision in the hands of a free market.  And this should encourage loser
<BR>
types to either reduce the number of children they have, or use high quality
<BR>
sperm donors.  It might also help people make better mate selection
<BR>
decisions.
<BR>
<P>BTW, I think we could also require insurance as a condition for parole.
<BR>
This
<BR>
way harmless people would be let out, while dangerous people would be facing
<BR>
impossibly high insurance rates.
<BR>
<P>-----
<BR>
What makes people think that corporate bureaucrats are any more trustworthy
<BR>
than government bureaucrats?  My girlfriend's entire family are all
<BR>
physicians,
<BR>
and quite skilled ones at that, and their insurance bureaucrat horror
<BR>
stories
<BR>
only reinforce what I'd already come to believe based on my own insurance
<BR>
horror
<BR>
stories: those people are as bad as, or worse than, government bureaucrats.
<BR>
<P>Why is a huge corporation supposed to be more trustworthy than the
<BR>
government?
<BR>
I'd no sooner give Microsoft regulatory control over the Internet than any
<BR>
government, and they would like such power as much as any government.
<BR>
<P>Eugenics is a sticky ethical situation, and the REASON is because the kind
<BR>
of
<BR>
choices that are to be made are to be made by bureaucracies - governmental
<BR>
or
<BR>
corporate bureaucracies all have their own agendas.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure this will be very unpopular to say in this crowd, but the free
<BR>
market
<BR>
is a myth.  Our economy, every economy on earth, actually, is a regulated
<BR>
economy.  Both governments and large corporations conspire to wield their
<BR>
power
<BR>
unequally to the masses, who suffer from dispersion of their power and
<BR>
difficulty
<BR>
in organizing and communicating.
<BR>
<P>Additionally, it is unclear that free-market eugenics would be any less
<BR>
ethically
<BR>
challenged, not to mention the dilemma that whom the masses selected as
<BR>
popular
<BR>
gene doners might not be such a great gene pool...  Think of people who have
<BR>
been very popular with the masses: John Travolta, Bill Clinton, Michael
<BR>
Jackson,
<BR>
Mike Tyson, not to mention truly evil people like Hitler.
<BR>
<P>Who is qualified to make the decision as to who is a &quot;loser type&quot;?  To many
<BR>
people,
<BR>
Extropians and other tech-heads, futurists, and general &quot;nerdy&quot; types are
<BR>
losers,
<BR>
and we should be exterminated.  Clearly, WE would not want THEM in charge of
<BR>
this
<BR>
decision, and THEY probably wouldn't want US in charge... In the free
<BR>
market, of
<BR>
whom is there more?  Us, or them?
<BR>
<P>People's faith in insurance companies is amusing.  I grew up fairly poor, in
<BR>
a
<BR>
lower-working-class family, and we were considered &quot;high risk&quot; by insurance
<BR>
companies.  Your notion that insurance companies would be able to sort out
<BR>
the
<BR>
&quot;good&quot; from the &quot;bad&quot; based on any criteria other than their ability to pay
<BR>
premiums is very funny to me.  I mostly avoided incarceration and managed to
<BR>
become middle-class through some cunning, and a lot of luck.  If insurance
<BR>
companies were involved in policing then dangerous wealthy people would
<BR>
walk,
<BR>
while innocuous poor people would get the shaft.  Hey, wait, that wouldn't
<BR>
change anything about the American justice system, would it...?
<BR>
<P>Someone may now make the argument &quot;well, they could be enlightened to the
<BR>
virtues
<BR>
of the 'good' poor people, and other social criteria other than ability to
<BR>
pay
<BR>
premiums could be used&quot;.  One can make the same argument about enlightening
<BR>
the
<BR>
government bureaucrats, and more convincingly, because a government at least
<BR>
theoretically has concerns other than just pure profit-motive.
<BR>
<P>Admittedly, though, it would be nice to save taxpayer dollars by having
<BR>
insurers
<BR>
foot the bill for mayhem caused by those criminals who COULD pay their
<BR>
insurance
<BR>
premiums...
<BR>
<P>Considering that capitalist economics has been intrinsic to the creation of
<BR>
the
<BR>
various American (and Western European, Australian, etc.) social ills,
<BR>
thinking that
<BR>
merely expanding rather than truly altering the character of the current
<BR>
economic
<BR>
system will create positive change in social issues seems like a fallacious
<BR>
argument
<BR>
to me.
<BR>
<P>Also, if enough power is given to corporations (and they will take it if
<BR>
govermental
<BR>
power is eroded under the current system), at what point to they become just
<BR>
as or
<BR>
more corrupt than the government?
<BR>
<P>Part of what Sasha and I (and others) were thinking about when the HEDG was
<BR>
founded
<BR>
was trying to change the character of economics through the creation of a
<BR>
network for
<BR>
the consumer masses to be able to better communicate and pool their economic
<BR>
power to
<BR>
influence and manipulate value in the system, to extend value beyond pure
<BR>
supply and
<BR>
demand economics, and to include valuation using social parameters to
<BR>
include benefit
<BR>
and detriment to the social and biological well-being of humans and the
<BR>
environments
<BR>
we depend upon as direct variables in the pricing calculation.
<BR>
<P>We're *supposed to* have a government &quot;by the people&quot;, and part of the
<BR>
problem is that
<BR>
at least we Americans have given too much power to the bureaucrats.
<BR>
However, the
<BR>
solution lies not in the corporations, but in the people.  A collection of
<BR>
monolithic
<BR>
power organizations is detrimental to the people, whether they're called
<BR>
corporations
<BR>
or governments.  If one wants a weaker government and stronger individual
<BR>
rights and
<BR>
better social climate, the responsibility lies with the people themselves.
<BR>
Our
<BR>
complacancy and laziness is as much a contribution to a corrupt system as
<BR>
the opportunism
<BR>
of those who sieze control.
<BR>
