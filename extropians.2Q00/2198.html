<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;All I own is mechanical guns. I don't trust those newfangled

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;electrickal gadgets.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Many of my associates won't own a semi-automatic for personal

<EM>&gt; &gt; defense because they don't consider them reliable enough.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I assume you mean &quot;self-loading&quot; rather than &quot;semi-automatic&quot;, since both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; revolvers and pistols are &quot;semi-automatic&quot; (unless you are talking about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; single-shot weapons).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The mythical reliability of revolvers has, in recent years, been largely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superceded by modern self-loading designs.  Most of the reputation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-loaders being unreliable can be traced to a hundred year history that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was dominated by the venerable Colt 1911 (first sold in 1905 despite the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; designation).
</EM><BR>
<P>There are myths about unreliability in autoloader pistols and there are
<BR>
truths.
<BR>
<P>For example, it is commonly accepted that the Colt 1911 is an inaccurate
<BR>
pistol and that autoloaders in general are not accurate. This perception
<BR>
comes from the military experience of many people (and those that bought
<BR>
military surplus 1911's), where they were issued pistols that were not
<BR>
well maintained by their previous users, and the rifling in the barrels
<BR>
had been shot out or rusted out. There was also a tendency for certain
<BR>
individual pistols to stack jam, and military (war era) pistol ammo was
<BR>
also of questionable quality in certain circumstances. All of this is
<BR>
old news, as James says, the newer, more expensive weapons are of quite
<BR>
good quality. I use a S&amp;W 3914 9mm compact straight stack autoloader for
<BR>
my primary self defense weapon. However less expensive guns, well, you
<BR>
get what you pay for.
<BR>
<P>On the plus side, I've shot a number of 1911's and variants and found
<BR>
them all to be accurate, though some will jam on non-standard ammo. My
<BR>
father's 35 year old 1911 I was able to shoot 4&quot; groups at 25 yards
<BR>
after only a few hours of practice, and I'll only get a few jams out of
<BR>
hundreds of rounds... other autoloaders, like the Isreali Arms
<BR>
Industries Desert Eagle and Baby Eagle are highly accurate weapons. I've
<BR>
seen a freind shoot his .50 cal Desert Eagle autoloader with 6&quot; groups
<BR>
at 300 yards.
<BR>
<P>.22 autoloader pistols do tend to jam on lead ball ammo, because most
<BR>
.22 actions have an extractor ramp in the barrel that provides a very
<BR>
sharp edge that the soft lead of the bullet can catch on and hang if the
<BR>
bullet does not load quite straight. Copper jacketed ammo does not have
<BR>
this problem.
<BR>
<P>The main reason, however, that revolvers are seen as more 'reliable' for
<BR>
self defense situations is this:
<BR>
a) a revolver, of any modern construction, is built such that you can
<BR>
carry a round in every chamber safely. The decock position typically
<BR>
rotates the drum halfway to the next chamber, so even if the firing pin
<BR>
did drop, it would strike the metal between chambers. In a self defense
<BR>
situation, simply release the safety, pull the trigger on your double
<BR>
action revolver, and you can fire. If the round you fire is a bad round,
<BR>
you can simply pull the trigger again to rotate to the next chamber.
<BR>
b) an autoloader, while there are many fine safety features, double
<BR>
action capability, decock, and firing pin locking mechanisms, if your
<BR>
first round is a dud, in order to fire another round, you have to
<BR>
manually pull the slide back to eject the round and reload. Some
<BR>
authorities, such as Massad Ayoob, John Ross, and a number of freinds of
<BR>
mine, all say that this extra time is of life critical importance.
<BR>
<P>Now, the question is: is your one in a couple hundred chance of getting
<BR>
a bad round on your first shot really a problem? Murphy's Law says yes,
<BR>
however this can be minimized by using only higher quality ammo for self
<BR>
defense (or load your own, another advantage of loading your own is that
<BR>
while commercial +P+ ammo (so called 'cop killer' ammo) cannot be bought
<BR>
by civilians, you are free to load whatever you feel comfortable with
<BR>
for your own use(*see note at bottom)), and the cheap stuff only for
<BR>
target practice. I use PMC 115 grain 9mm standard rounds for target
<BR>
practice, but I use 109 grain 9mm +P from Cor-Bon for self defense. The
<BR>
+P rounds shoot a little higher, but I also find them to be more
<BR>
accurate, and I've never had a jam or bad round with them.
<BR>
<P>I don't like the bulk of most revolvers, though I'm thinking of getting
<BR>
a North American Arms Mini-Revolver in .22 magnum as a backup/light
<BR>
clothing gun, as that is a really nice compact gun, and considering that
<BR>
most self defense situations in public are going to tend to be
<BR>
situations where an 'up-the-nose-gun' is all thats really needed (most
<BR>
happen within ten feet), then .22 magnum is quite sufficient for making
<BR>
an omlette of some perps mental faculties. On the flip side, the
<BR>
frequency of hi-capacity magazines in autoloaders puts the revolver user
<BR>
at a distinct disadvantage in an extended incident...
<BR>
<P>The point of concealed carry is two fold: a) the existence of it as a
<BR>
legal option is a public deterrent over the community, and b) in
<BR>
instances where it needs to be actually used, you want to incapacitate
<BR>
the perp without overpenetrating and having stray rounds going off and
<BR>
possibly hurting someone else. 
<BR>
<P>Some people like carrying big, powerful guns concealed. This is really a
<BR>
waste for most situations. .454 Casull, .357, 44 magnum , and other
<BR>
large  powerful rounds are really not necessary for outdoors use except
<BR>
in situations where you are dealing with multiple perps and bladed
<BR>
weapons. For one on one situations, in close quarters, a .22 or .32
<BR>
round into the brain case is all thats needed to end the story. A .22
<BR>
has enough energy and penetration to enter the brain case, but usually
<BR>
not enough to exit, so it tends to ricochet around inside several
<BR>
times... 
<BR>
<P>The two points of using big guns is that a) in body shots, they are more
<BR>
likely to drop the perp where he stands, put him into shock, but they
<BR>
are less likely to die from their injuries than with smaller calibers
<BR>
(since shock causes the body to immediately go into a conservative
<BR>
survival mode) which do not trigger a shock reaction in the body, so the
<BR>
perp is more likely to bleed to death with a small caliber wound, and b)
<BR>
big guns simply say to perps:&quot;I'm a big mean gun and I'm gonna hurt you
<BR>
somthin awful&quot;, so they are more likely to turn and run, or not even
<BR>
mess with you if you are carrying openly.
<BR>
<P>NOTE: if you are loading your own +P+ grade ammo, or using +P and/or
<BR>
hollow point bullets (which do increase damage to the target, but
<BR>
minimize overpenetration and potential damage to innocent bystanders),
<BR>
keep in mind that in the event you actually have to use this ammo for
<BR>
self defense, a prosecutor is going to love going after you, because the
<BR>
willful use of this ammo they claim indicates planning and prior intent
<BR>
to cause harm (i.e. 'bloodthirstyness') and increases your chance of
<BR>
getting prosecuted for a self defense incident. To help yourself avoid
<BR>
this possibility, I always recommend you only load the first few rounds
<BR>
with the good stuff, then load the rest of the magazine with more
<BR>
mundane rounds, so if in such an event, make sure you fire all the good
<BR>
rounds before the cops arrive, so all that left in your mag are the
<BR>
mundane rounds. This is of questionable ethics, but if they don't know
<BR>
you used the powerful rounds, don't think to ask because all they see
<BR>
are mundane rounds in your gun, and you don't tell them (your 5th
<BR>
amendment right), then you are far less likely to get prosecuted for the
<BR>
deal. What they don't know can't hurt you. This is considered by lawyers
<BR>
to be 'sound legal advice' if you are intent on defending yourself. The
<BR>
other plus is if they 'know' you were using round ball ammo, and they
<BR>
know the bad guy was shot with +P hollow point ammo, they are less
<BR>
likely to look at you as the shooter anyways...(rifling on hollow point
<BR>
ammo is typically of too poor quality to use as credible evidence)
