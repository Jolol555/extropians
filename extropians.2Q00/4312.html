Well if the universe is really a huge matrix-like simulation at the
<BR>
quantum level, why can't the photon and polarizing filter just &quot;flip
<BR>
a coin&quot; when they interact and then proceed from there? That would make
<BR>
it pretty easy. 
<BR>
Brian Atkins
<BR>
<P><P>Well, the story might be a bit more complicated.
<BR>
<P>Bell¹s inequalities (and related experiments with entangled particles, such
<BR>
as Aspect¹s, etc.) show that local hidden variables theories are wrong and
<BR>
(classical) quantum mechanics is right. So we must take some ³non-local²
<BR>
factor into account. But non-local does not mean, necessarily, spooky waves
<BR>
travelling up &amp; down, faster than light. Non-local mean that if you measure
<BR>
(here) some observable of the particle p you (at the same time) fix the
<BR>
observable (there) of the entangled particle q. Actually those entangled
<BR>
particles have one space, one topology in common.
<BR>
<P>Bell¹s inequalities (and related experiments) do not show that non-local
<BR>
hidden variables theories are wrong. What are those (many) non-local hidden
<BR>
variables theories is difficult to say. Somebody thinks that the
<BR>
experimental apparatus itself takes non-local variables...
<BR>
<P>Bell¹s inequalities (and related experiments) show that Reichenbach¹s
<BR>
³causality² (or ³causal correlation²) does not hold, in the quantum domain.
<BR>
In classical physics if A and B are events (now), and c was another event
<BR>
(in the past), so that A and B are both functions of c, and P&lt;A(c)&gt; is the
<BR>
probability of A, and P&lt;B(c)&gt; is the probability of B, and P&lt;A(c),B(c)&gt; is
<BR>
the joint probability, we can say that P&lt;A(c),B(c)&gt; = P&lt;A(c)&gt; x P&lt;B(c)&gt;. In
<BR>
quantum mechanics that¹s not true!
<BR>
<P>But you can try to recover causality (or causal correlation) changing the
<BR>
³topology² of those entangled particles dynamics, or changing the
<BR>
description of that dynamics (Clifford¹s quantum field algebra, etc.), or
<BR>
even thinking that the observables of those entangled particles are
<BR>
³pre-setted² from the beginning (in the K-atom), or even changing the
<BR>
interpretation of quantum mechanics, i.e. from the Copenhagen interpretation
<BR>
to the Everett¹s ³relative states² (avoiding waves packet collapse and
<BR>
avoiding the observable-apparatus problem) interpretation (as Bell did) to
<BR>
the De Broglie-Bohm interpretation (as Bell did, also).
<BR>
<P>As John Clark pointed out ³one thing is certain: whatever the truth is,
<BR>
it's weird² or (may I say?) ... very subtle.
