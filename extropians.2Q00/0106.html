<P><EM>&gt; &gt; ...no matter how much time [Eliezer S. Yudkowsky] spend thinking about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Singularity, suggestions like these still give me the chills.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Since at least 1950, &quot;hemispherectomy&quot; (the surgical removal of half the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; brain) has been used in children for hemiplegia and intractable epilepsy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;From <A HREF="http://www.c3.hu/~mavideg/jns/642696june1.html">http://www.c3.hu/~mavideg/jns/642696june1.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Epilepsy is an electrical storm of sorts that takes place across the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corpus callosum.  Seems like if hemispherectomy/transplant could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be worked out, then two severely epileptic children could perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be cured by having them switch left hemispheres.  Then they would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both end up with a full brain as well.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately no, the problem is that there usually exist one or
<BR>
several epileptic loci, areas where a lack of inhibition causes the
<BR>
neurons to go into a positive feedback loop triggering the
<BR>
seizures. If you could transplant the hemispheres you would also
<BR>
transplant the loci.
<BR>
<P>One of my favorite books from my childhood was _En Levande Sjal_ by
<BR>
P.C. Jersild. It was the diary of a brain named Upsilon living in an
<BR>
aquarium at a research lab, dealing with its everyday life and the
<BR>
various odd things going on at the lab (everything from its unrequited
<BR>
love of a scientist over a severed crawling hand to the mysterious
<BR>
plots of the lab rats). Gradually Upsilon is subjected to stranger and
<BR>
stranger experiments, including having one hemisphere exchanged with
<BR>
its old enemy, the aggressive brain Omega (one scene involves the
<BR>
brains swimming around fighting). A rather odd situation where it
<BR>
suddenly was and wasn't itself and had a &quot;brother&quot; that was nearly
<BR>
identical to itself/themselves.
<BR>
<P>It was this kind of books that made me a transhumanist. :-)
