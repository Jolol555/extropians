<EM>&gt; My two cents:
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; More generally, I think I can make the stronger case that this doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just happen in rare instances.  By and large, WHENEVER you're trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; convince someone that something is true, *whenever* you make a statement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the simple indicative mood, you're almost certain to be more convincing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a person if you don't call them an idiot or refer to their ideas as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idiotic, and, of course, they're very likely to be happier about it to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extent that you avoid doing so, people being as they are.  (Though it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be better if they were otherwise.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Very good!
<BR>
<P>More specifically, on the subject of flaming on the net:
<BR>
<P>One participates in a public, non-realtime internet forum (be it a
<BR>
mailing list or a newsgroup) for one of two purposes: to speak or to
<BR>
listen. (When speaking, one wants to convince others that ones' point of
<BR>
view is correct; when listening, one is attempting to acquire new data.)
<BR>
<P>It is axiomatic that you can't force somebody to listen to what
<BR>
you're saying, on a mailing list or on usenet. They can killfile you,
<BR>
unsubscribe, or walk away.
<BR>
<P>Human beings tend to respond reflexively to displays of aggression,
<BR>
verbal or physical. If you are rude to someone, chances are that they
<BR>
will be rude right back.
<BR>
<P>A point to note is that if you're trying to get a viewpoint across
<BR>
on a public list or newsgroup, the odds are that the person you're
<BR>
directing your comments to is _not_ your real audience; you're arguing
<BR>
with somebody who doesn't agree with you, and the likelihood of changing
<BR>
their mind is very low. Your _real_ audience consists of the interested
<BR>
but silent by-standers reading the thread. _They_ may listen to what
<BR>
you say, because they're not bound up in reflexively responding to you;
<BR>
they have no emotional capital invested in the argument.
<BR>
<P>It therefore follows that making insulting and wild comments -- &quot;all
<BR>
religionists are shit-heads&quot; -- may generalise your insult to the third-
<BR>
party by-standers you most want to reach. While insulting the other party
<BR>
in the discussion more specifically (&quot;John Doe's mother wears army boots
<BR>
and smells of elderberries&quot;) suggests to them that you have run out of
<BR>
effective arguments to deploy.
<BR>
<P>The upshot is: never throw wild accusations or abuse around in a 
<BR>
discussion unless you (a) have considered very carefully the possible
<BR>
impact on the notional dispassionate observer, or (b) want to lose the
<BR>
debate.
<BR>
<P>Classic examples of wild accusations include: &quot;baby butchers&quot;, &quot;gun
<BR>
grabbers&quot;, &quot;pinko commie fag liberals&quot;, &quot;nazi republocrats&quot;, &quot;god
<BR>
botherers&quot;, &quot;Christ-killing jews&quot;. Fun as these terms might be, employing
<BR>
them serves to screw your chances of convincing anyone who might be
<BR>
vaguely in favour of contraception, of not letting convicted felons and
<BR>
lunatics own guns, people who believe in a collective duty to give alms
<BR>
to the destitute, people who believe in fiscal propriety, quakers, and
<BR>
people like me.
