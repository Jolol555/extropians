<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Question legal types:  if we extropians were the first to land and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; stay on Mars, could we legally claim the whole rock?  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  You could try, but the Outer Space treaty prohibits extraterrestrial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  claims, and signatory nations would not recognize such claims.  Bottom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  line is, you'd have to be ready to survive an embargo.  Conversely, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  a great big commons that you're free to rape- materials extracted would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  be yours, ya just can't claim real estate.  When the time comes, this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  treaty could be renegotiated or abrogated, of course.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll check in more detail to confimr this, but I think the treaty only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prohibits national claims of SOVEREIGNTY.  The issue of private OWNERSHIP is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left untouched, although, naturally, most conventional-minded lawyers assume
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;no sovereignty&quot; = &quot;no property&quot;, since they identify property with the state.
</EM><BR>
<P>The big problem with the Outer Space Treaty and the Moon Treaty is that they
<BR>
violate a principle of international law called 'dereliction of sovereignty',
<BR>
whereas a claimant to sovereign power over some piece of property must maintain
<BR>
some sort of presence or record of regular visitation and maintenance. This is
<BR>
the legal basis for the claims of sovereignty that the Prince of Sealand made to
<BR>
support his taking over that gun platform, in that it was outside the
<BR>
territorial waters of the UK, and that the UK maintained no presence and made no
<BR>
visitations or maintenance upon the site on an annual basis. It is this
<BR>
principle that requires that all islands around the world that are not within
<BR>
the territorial boundaries of some other land must be visited at least once a
<BR>
year by representatives of the sovereign power that claims them. The US Coast
<BR>
Guard does this function with all islands the US claims which are uninhabited.
<BR>
<P>When it comes to space, this obviously brings up an issue of visitation. One
<BR>
might claim that an automated robot might possibly count as a 'visitation' or
<BR>
'presence', but robots are not citizens and cannot carry power of attorney or
<BR>
diplomatic status (though there is the case of a king appointing his horse to
<BR>
cabinet or some such drivel). This clearly opens up the possibility that these
<BR>
treaties have no force under international law due to their violation of the
<BR>
principle of dereliction of sovereignty.
<BR>
<P>Nations that are signors of the Antarctic Treaty can maintain this principle
<BR>
there because they have permanent manned presences there.
