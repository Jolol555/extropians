<P>Wow.
<BR>
<P>I know zlich about neuro-whatever, but can observe what's happening to
<BR>
myself. I'm sitting here, surrounded by three PCs which pretty much
<BR>
continually display animated, colorful web pages and typical apps used
<BR>
to develop web sites and applications. This goes on for hours and hours
<BR>
everyday, pretty much from when I wake up to when I go to sleep. I'm a
<BR>
consultant who works 90% at home, and alone during the day.
<BR>
<P>For relaxation, I sometimes play games, Quake, HOMM III, SMAC, MOO II,
<BR>
etc. A while back I noticed that I would sometimes have 'pangs' occuring
<BR>
in my head while waiting to fall asleep. This occured most noticably
<BR>
after some intense on-line FPS or RTS gaming. Often the 'pang' would be
<BR>
a specific sound effect from a game: the retreat effect of a spaceship
<BR>
withdrawing from battle in MOO II, the 'thump-BOOM!' of a siege tank
<BR>
firing from Dune 2000.
<BR>
<P>I've had such 'pangs' before, in my youth, long before exposure to video
<BR>
games, and by 'pang' I mean a very brief but intense stimulus that wakes
<BR>
me up and often triggers involuntary muscular action. If you've never
<BR>
experienced this I would recommend meditating on a corked faucet
<BR>
building up pressure right before you go to sleep.
<BR>
<P>Now, I've learned to avoid certain games right before bedtime, and am
<BR>
considering getting off the computers for an hour or so and viewing some
<BR>
TV comedy or reading instead. The 'pangs' were usually very occasional,
<BR>
but lately I'm experiencing something I call 'whooshes', and what it
<BR>
feels like is every neuron in my brain firing at once. This can occur
<BR>
especially if I take a late afternoon nap and is unrelated to gaming but
<BR>
I feel certainly related to my work environment.
<BR>
<P>Somewhere here there is an intersection between my experiences, the link
<BR>
referred to above, Greg Egan's _Distress_, etc. I don't know how it all
<BR>
fits together but to me it suggests that humanity -- or at least the
<BR>
portion of humanity consisting of high-tech workers in a similar
<BR>
position to myself -- is doomed. I know I'm projecting here, but I feel
<BR>
we are lost - there is no going back. We have to embrace post-humanity,
<BR>
and the post-biological, because we have already passed the point of no
<BR>
return. Chips are destiny (Kosovo?)
<BR>
<P>This applies even if 'The Last Mortal Generation' is the one that steps
<BR>
into the brain-scanning uploading machines.
