<P><EM>&gt; Sarah, if you want to be frozen after legal death (cryonics), you DON'T want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be an organ donor. As I understand it, in order to be an organ donor, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to be in a certain medical condition with respect to your brain waves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This may require that a certain period of time pass after you stop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; breathing, or something to that effect; in any event, I have heard cryonics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; honchos such as Mike Darwin and/or Brian Wowk say that being an organ donor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may well ruin your chances to get a good freeze.
</EM><BR>
<P>So what you are saying is that you don't currently have a protocol for
<BR>
neurosuspension customers to simulataneously have their heads guillotined and
<BR>
suspended, while the rest of the organs get harvested? I think thats kind of
<BR>
short sighted, don't you think?  What better way to pay for your suspension than
<BR>
off of auctioned off body parts? If you made this legal, suspension would
<BR>
basically be free, so the perceived cost barrier (for those who don't think of,
<BR>
or don't want to have to keep paying on, a life insurance policy just for the
<BR>
suspension) is totally eliminated. Set this up as an accepted medical procedure,
<BR>
and it can simply be a non-cash transaction between an organ donor center and
<BR>
the donor. Donor centers might find it both profitable, and a good way to
<BR>
diversify, to merge with a cryonic suspension organization.
