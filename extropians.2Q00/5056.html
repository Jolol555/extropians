<P>The above is a concise, fairly correct economics lesson 
<BR>
and partial rundown on the current financial 
<BR>
disaster-in-the making.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I urge you all to educate yourselves post haste in these
<BR>
matters. Events are moving quickly now. It appears the 
<BR>
bond market is entering a liquidity crises, for example.
<BR>
Gold may be preparing for its moonshot, the dollar is looking
<BR>
extremely shaky- as in hyperinflation.
<BR>
<P>Do not expect to find useful guidance from the 
<BR>
lying media and government sources or the bought-and-paid-for 
<BR>
economics departments at every major university. 
<BR>
<P>They are corrupt beyond belief.
<BR>
<P><P>a couple excerpts:
<BR>
<P>Robert H. Hemphill, former credit manager, Federal Reserve Bank 
<BR>
of Atlanta:
<BR>
&quot;Money is the most important subject intellectual persons 
<BR>
can investigate and reflect upon. It is so important that our 
<BR>
present civilization may collapse unless it is widely understood 
<BR>
and its defects remedied very soon.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&quot;it is important that people understand that the economic downturn 
<BR>
is not caused by greedy businessmen or evil foreigners, but by our
<BR>
government's corruption of the money supply.   We have seen how it 
<BR>
is the nature of the Federal Reserve to create easy credit. The
<BR>
consequences of easy credit are distortions in the economy. 
<BR>
It misleads businessmen to expand when there is no market for their 
<BR>
goods. It causes stock speculation to drive the market to unrealistic 
<BR>
heights. Finally, as these distortions drive out real savings it causes 
<BR>
recessions and depressions.&quot;

<BR>
<P>&quot;There remains considerable uncertainty as to whether the global economy 
<BR>
is at the beginning of a long boom, driven by technology and
<BR>
deregulation, or whether it is significantly exposed to the possibility 
<BR>
of a downturn through which long-standing macroeconomic imbalances will 
<BR>
eventually be resolved. There is also an unusual degree of uncertainty 
<BR>
about how financial markets, which have been evolving rapidly, might 
<BR>
react to possibly adverse macroeconomic shocks.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A rather strong statement from the BIS.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>Daniel Webster:
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;Of all the contrivances for cheating the laboring classes of 
<BR>
mankind, none has been more effective than that which deludes them with
<BR>
paper money.&quot; 
<BR>
<P><P>Also lots of good material at:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.prudentbear.com/">http://www.prudentbear.com/</A>
<BR>
<P>There are two main schools of economics- the lying, thieving school
<BR>
of corruption and debauchery known as Monetarism (with various 
<BR>
strains such as Keynesism, supply-side, etc.) that emphasizes 
<BR>
printing up extra 'money' whenever the ruling class feels like
<BR>
going on a shopping spree, or to 'fund' other hare-brained 
<BR>
Communist/Fascist/Socialist schemes such as Social Security 
<BR>
or public education;
<BR>
<P>and what's come to be called the Austrian School, such as:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.mises.org/">http://www.mises.org/</A>
<BR>
<P>And, yes, tech is real cool, lotsa stuff going on, but what 
<BR>
difference will that make to you if you end up in a labor camp?
<BR>
<P>Have a lovely day,
<BR>
