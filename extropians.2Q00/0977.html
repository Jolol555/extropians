<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I didn't use the correct English term, I didn't mean a nice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; government but the society that is not the government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Understood, but are you hypothesizing a civil society without government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;present or just community movements that will create a civil society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;while ignoring government? Typically if you try to ignore government,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they get really suspicious of your motives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not hypothesizing, the civil society is all around us now. It is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; institutions that people have created like clubs, associations et al. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been severly blocked by the state that often has taken over or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incorporated their activities (corporativism). No body created this (like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the market economy) it was created by spontaneous order. I think that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumanism has much to gain from supporting this, since they often create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a more dynamist environment than etatism that often creates a stasist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment in society through its controls.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, understood. Many civic groups have been and can be formed to help minimize
<BR>
crime, for example. neighborhood watch groups abound around the country, and are
<BR>
quite effective in many circumstances. There's a rather easy to see and track
<BR>
correlation between high crime and a lack of community involvement and spirit.
<BR>
Those that think the police are there to protect them are hopelessly wrong.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Once again I must reccomend Virginia Postrel's &quot;The future and its enemies&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed, I think the US naturalizes about 1 MILLION legal immigrants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; year. In Europe there is hardly any mobility even between the countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the European Union. And the EU has erected a strict barrier against the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;rest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Its our only real source of population growth. The US is, according to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;some, a group of nations (legalistically this is true, its a federation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of sovereign states) on a cultural level. There's the various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;metropolitan city states, the industrial northeast, the south, Texas (a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;planet all its own), the south west, the northwest, and the populist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;midwestern states, and Alaska. I'm sure that many in europe look at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;mobility between all of these states and cultures as a big contributor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to not only the dynamism but the civil distress that goes on here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But they are wrong.:-)
</EM><BR>
<P>To a point. The benefits of a population that is less mobile is that you get to
<BR>
know your neighbors much better if your families have all lived in the same
<BR>
neighborhood for a couple generations. You are much more sensitive to odd
<BR>
circumstances than you would be if you lived anonymously in some anonymous
<BR>
building somewhere and never knew your neighbors. There is a distinct difference
<BR>
between a society built on personal privacy and a society built on impersonality
<BR>
and anonymity. One is built on trust and respect, while the other is built on
<BR>
distrust and fear. A highly mobile society is more likely to live, IMHO by the
<BR>
second instance than the first.
