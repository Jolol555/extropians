<EM>&gt; &gt; What I want to know is: if there are only 76 million combinations of

<EM>&gt; &gt; numbers, and tickets cost only $1 each, and the jackpot is over $200
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; million, why hasn't some group of people gotten together to buy all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the possible combinations? Even if someone else wins too you are still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gonna profit. Too much paperwork I guess?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My guess is that more than one person can win; ergo, everyone on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planet buys tickets, 10 people win, and the payoff is only $20M per.
</EM><BR>
....
<BR>
<P>More than one person can win.  There was an Australian consortium a
<BR>
few years ago that used to keep an eye out for positive expectation
<BR>
lotteries where, at the last minute, ticket sales were slow-paced
<BR>
enough to justify belief that even with the expected number of winners
<BR>
to share of the profit with, the consortium had a positive EV for
<BR>
their ticket purchases.  Once they determined that, they'd send
<BR>
operatives to swoop down and cover every possible combination.
<BR>
Apparently it was something of a white-knuckle business in the places
<BR>
that were good for them because those were usually states where the
<BR>
ticket stores were harder to get to than desirable for them, and
<BR>
sometimes they only managed to cover all the numbers at the last
<BR>
minute.  The U.S. was particularly prime pickings for them since there
<BR>
are 50 states, so at any given time there's often one state lottery
<BR>
that's a good bet, and you can just drive your busload of operatives
<BR>
to the relevant spot fairly easily.
<BR>
<P>The really big thing was that the winnings were untaxed in any way.
<BR>
Apparently gambling winnings in the U.S. by a foreigner do not (or at
<BR>
the time did not) subject you to U.S. taxes, and Australia (like many
<BR>
former British Commonwealth countries) has no tax on gambling.  So the
<BR>
consortium would just pocket the profits.  After they walked away with
<BR>
many millions from (I think) Tennessee there were rumors that either
<BR>
the U.S. or Tennessee might start imposing a special tax on winnings
<BR>
for people who cover more than some large fraction of the lottery
<BR>
numbers.
