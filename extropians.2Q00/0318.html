<EM>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately for MS, they seem to have been quite unable to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; straightforward or forthright about their reasons for managing at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one key issue the way that they have. Specifically, as an actual user of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Win98, I can confidently report that it was totally unnecessary for them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to insist that a Microsoft web browser be packaged with every copy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Windows98 -- in other words, there was no *technical* necessity for then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to market things that way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Maybe this is picky, but I would feel better about MS if they had said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all along that including the browser was strictly a case of marketing or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; packaging, it being their commercial right not to offer anything less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than a package deal if they don't want to?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe what they actually said was that it is a competitive necessity for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any modern OS to come with a bundled web browser.  Since I can't think of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modern OS that doesn't come with someone's browser, I think this is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonable claim.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure if they issued a web server for free with their OS as well,
<BR>
you'd see whining and crying from Red Hat and Inprise, as well as a
<BR>
dumping lawsuit by Corel and the Canadians in the WTO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As far as saying that Windows won't run without MS Internet Explorer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if MS does things in a way that unnecessarily restricts its customers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that counts for more than all the complaints of a thousand competing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; companies, it seems to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, this is a good example of the MS approach to system optimization.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What happened was once they decided they needed to include the a browser
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with every copy of the OS, they started thinking about how to do that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without generating more complaints about code bloat.  So, they basically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; went through the IE feature list, found everything that duplicated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functionality they wanted to be part of the OS, and started integrating the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; duplicated features.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The fact that this lets them claim IE is an essential part of the OS was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably a factor in their decision, but it makes good technical sense too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why implement multiple systems for things like screen rendering, hyperlink
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; navigation, and XML support if you don't have to?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, Gates was only following the lead of people at Sun, Oracle,
<BR>
Netscape, and Novell who were claiming that 'the network is the
<BR>
computer'. Assuming this logic, the browser should be the primary
<BR>
interface of an operating system. Once he jumped on the bandwagon and
<BR>
played fiddle better than anyone, they started crying to big Uncle Sugar
<BR>
about Billy not playing fair. Little Lord Larry Ellison pouted and
<BR>
stomped his little footy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, what they have now is a software library that implements almost all of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the IE functionality, and is also used by Windows wherever it presents a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; similar feature.  The IE program itself is just a thin wrapper around this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functionality.  You can remove IE, but you can't get rid of the COM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; components that implement most of its features without breaking the system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OTOH, you can also use those components from your own programs, which is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nice benefit for ISVs and other sophisticated users of the OS.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, they ought to just go back to calling their browser 'File Manager',
<BR>
merge it with &quot;Network Neighborhood&quot;, use all the new hooks and DLLs,
<BR>
and retire the IE name.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at some point the presumption of customers' intelligence and freedom to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ought to be placed foremost, don't you think?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've never understood why people think this is an issue.  You are perfectly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free to use any browser you want.  You can get rid of the IE icon and menu
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; item if you want to, and since browsers are free there isn't even a cost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issue involved.  So, how is the fact that MS decided to build an HTML engine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into their OS hurting anyone other than Netscape?
</EM><BR>
<P>I know. I've had a preference for, and used as a default, Netscape since
<BR>
I first got on the web (before that I was using galacticom's Worldcom
<BR>
BBS software), and I've never had trouble using it with windows, or as
<BR>
the default browser.
