There is a term that I learned when I was younger and although it 
<BR>
is considered by some to a little vulgar, it does have the quality of 
<BR>
sometimes being the perfect word to describe a situation.  The 
<BR>
word is &quot;chickenshit&quot;.   It is a useful term to indicate when an 
<BR>
item of small (or no) importance or relevance is given more
<BR>
attention than is warranted. And an individual could lose a lot of 
<BR>
reputation capital when they tried to use a chickenshit
<BR>
issue to attack someone else.
<BR>
<P>In this case a minor issue is brought up months later.  The
<BR>
previous months of inactivity about the matter indicate to me 
<BR>
that perhaps we are dealing with a chickenshit situation.  
<BR>
<P>Individuals may want to avoid decreasing what limited reputation
<BR>
capital they still have.
<BR>
<P>Regards
<BR>

<EM>&gt;Extropians,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm Stan Kretler.  I participated in the original discussion about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;ultrahumanism&quot; and &quot;otherhumanisms&quot; from last year.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Just to set the record straight, &quot;setting the record straight&quot; about some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ancient use of &quot;ultrahumanism&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with Max and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Brian's dispute involving the term.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And, also for the record, *I* was the one who first took the time to look 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the word up in a dictionary.  So I want credit for that! ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;ultra&quot; and &quot;human&quot; are common enough that it's absurd to think the two 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;haven't been combined many times in the past.  Any question about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;originality here is about the use of &quot;ultrahuman&quot; in the context of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussion about possibly improved names for posthumanism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But even that question of originality is still not relevant to how Max 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;treated Brian, which has nothing to do with any matter of originality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What many of you don't know, by the way, is that Brian has actually 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*defended* Max and the Extropy Institute many times among some acquaintances 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and colleagues here.  He bristled when someone referred to it as &quot;rednecks 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the internet&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Even when people were telling him that Max was a sleaze bag for having the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gall to suggest (maybe suggest, or perhaps &quot;slyly suggest&quot; is the better 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;description) that Brian might have actually lifted the term from the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conference Web page, Brian kept searching for alternative explanations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In fact, after I posted the OED definition (and or made some reference to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Brian's previous discussion of the question of the right name for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transhumanism), guess who came in to make sure that credit isn't unduly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;taken away from Max?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Brian!  (He said to me, publicly, &quot;Extropians are capable of independent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought, you'll discover&quot;!)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Personally, I think the matter should be dropped.  But if someone wants to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chime in, at least get the facts right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The question that matters is why, after Max responded to the above with this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;For the record, I came us with &quot;ultrahuman&quot; several months ago, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;thinking about my book and my talk for the conference. I was surprised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;and amused to see your use of the term immediately before I first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;used the term publically at the conference (though it had been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;on the conference program for a while before that). This isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;really surprising though. Several people have independently come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;up with &quot;extropy&quot; and &quot;transhuman&quot; (or &quot;transhuman&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- and Brian privately reminded Max of the earlier emails, and Max told Brian 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he would correct the impression that Brian might have in fact stolen the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idea from the Web page, Max *never* responded.  Even after being reminded 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;twice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Max looked, and esp now look*S*, rather bad.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The amazing thing is, Brian continued to defend Max and the Extropy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Institute, even though his friends thought it was obvious that Max was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;jealously guarding his new idea about a better term for transhumanism, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wanted Brian to look bad.  (What else can account for such behavior?  &quot;ooops 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I forgot&quot; after repeated reminders isn't a very convincing excuse).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I doubt Brian will defend the Extropy Institute anymore, though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Max did finally apologize, however, so perhaps Brian thinks the matter is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;settled (he's out of town for a while I think.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If people want to look things up in dictionaries, fine.  But don't pretend 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it has any thing to do with Brian or Max.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As for Natasha......
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bye,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Stan Kretler.
