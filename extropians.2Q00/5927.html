<EM>&gt; &gt; Following the recent Mars threads, and the parallel though unrelated outburst

<EM>&gt; &gt; of heaton the &gt;H list, I feel I have to speak up about the public relations 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gap futurists, and especially &gt;H and Extropians are facing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Why live in a gravity well when you can disassemble the planets and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; distribute their mass...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Claims like these, even if made in jest, will turn what could be a very strong 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; public relations asset to a serious disadvantage - instead of &quot;tour Mars: see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the majestic cliffs of Olympus Mons&quot; the slogan would be &quot;don't return to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1900s - save space from the industrialists&quot; or &quot;Don't repeat the mistakes of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Earth - Don't mine Mars!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think these comments are necessarily being made in jest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some people do believe that planets are an inefficient use of mass.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most of the mass is on the interior and doesn't do anyone any good, aside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from providing some gravity.  And if you need that, you can probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get it more efficiently by centrifugal force or stellar gravity.
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't mean to sugggest that these were all being made in jest - in fact the
<BR>
&quot;in jest&quot; comment was more directed at some of the others - in specific the
<BR>
&quot;raping&quot; comment.
<BR>
<P>I also happen to agree to a certain level that planets are something of a waste
<BR>
of mass, in terms of posthuman uses.  My main issue actually was one of 
<BR>
semantics and ethics - an example that bring up the dissolution and destruction
<BR>
of planets in our own solar system would be viewed as a statement of intent,
<BR>
rathe rthan a (for now) theoretical analysis.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It may be that these ideas are difficult for people to accept and do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bring to mind the environmental catastrophes in the past.  But I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think we should necessarily tone down our views as a result.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not saying tone down views - witness my comment abotu censorship.  This is
<BR>
not about hiding views; this is about presenting them.  &lt;southern drawl&gt;&quot;We're
<BR>
gonna make sure your kids ain't gona be retards&quot;&lt;/southern drawl&gt; is a LOT less
<BR>
palatable than &quot;we're working toward augmenting our genome to provide enhanced
<BR>
intelligence to everyone.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Yes, all this wrapping and such is tedious.  But language is imprecise at 
<BR>
presenting ideas in their full context.  And the only thing that the sort of
<BR>
&quot;I don't have to package my ideas for you&quot; mentality presents to others is &quot;I
<BR>
don't think your thoughts and issues are worth my time considering.&quot;  Hubris 
<BR>
is the enemy of the forward-thinking.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;SNIP&gt; I don't think we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to be that careful to couch our views in a manner which is acceptable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to this month's mores.
</EM><BR>
<P>Au  contraire, I think that it is CRITICAL that views are at least made in 
<BR>
such a way as to be not a direct affront to common mores and values of the
<BR>
period.  Remember, most of us live in democracies.  Think of the issues in
<BR>
Europe against &quot;Frankenstein foods&quot;, or here in the US with fetal tissue 
<BR>
research.  The people you are looking down upon, i.e. the people for whom 
<BR>
you are not considering their values, are the people who are having a strong
<BR>
influence on what research can and can't be done.
<BR>
<P>&quot;That's one good thing about abortion - it gives us all this fetal stem cell
<BR>
tissue on which we can do research of how to stop aging.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Consider how that statement looks to somoene who holds strong views about 
<BR>
optional abortion. And I hope that makes my point.
