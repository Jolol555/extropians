<EM>&gt; &gt;Well that's the real catch isn't it? I just don't see how you can logically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;say that simultaneously you disagree with certain parts of a philosophy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;yet still call yourself a member of it? Is that like calling yourself a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;catholic and then having an abortion when it suits you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While I agree with some of what you have said, I do balk at the idea of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;all or nothing&quot; philosophy such as you apparently suggest.  As Natasha and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nadia both touched on, it is the constant influx of challenging ideas that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keeps a philosophy such as Extropianism healthy and growing.  This is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same reason why the philosophy of Objectivism has not grown in the last few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decades...there is no room or desire for new ideas and growth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While I must admit that I personally agree with all the Extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Principles and have been an ExI member for a number of years, I have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desire to close the door on other viewpoints which may not explicitly fit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the philosophy or support the principles.  I would, however, like to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most people who call themselves &quot;Extropian&quot; become actual members.  It is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relatively cheap way of putting one's money where one's mind is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreeing to describe yourself as an Extropian does not mean you have to
<BR>
close the door on other viewpoints. If you find some other philosophy
<BR>
that you identify with more, or you find yourself in disagreement with
<BR>
one of the extropian principles then you can simply declare yourself to
<BR>
no longer be an extropian and proceed from there.
