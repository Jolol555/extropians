Tis true!  It's an obsession with people who kinda, sorta, suspect that there 
<BR>
may be more to existence then what we currently are able or willing to 
<BR>
measure. People who are threatened by the more innocuous folk who hold 
<BR>
spiritual longings, seem to merely be pissed off at authority figures. As a 
<BR>
non-Christian on the list, I always find it amazing how even the most ardent 
<BR>
atheist seems intellectually hemmed-in by European Christian cultural 
<BR>
attitudes. We are all recipients of cultural brainwashing and what we do as 
<BR>
adults with that 'brainwashing' is what determines whom we are. Read Freeman 
<BR>
Dyson for an example of someone who has religious leanings yet is not 
<BR>
oppressive about these -personal matters-which is all they really are.

<P>&lt;&lt; Generalizations are not usually accurate. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;You describe an atheist as laughing at religion. That may be your stance, 
<BR>
but 
<BR>
&nbsp;it is certainly not mine, or many others who are not believers. Not all 
<BR>
&nbsp;people who believe in god/gods/goddess/whatever are being &quot;duped&quot;. Many are 
<BR>
&nbsp;searching for manageable tenets on which to base their actions.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Many spiritual people have things they can teach me. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;These teachings can be extremely helpful, especially buddists and some of 
<BR>
the 
<BR>
&nbsp;fringe neo-eastern groups, or the rogue fellows which the secular humanists 
<BR>
&nbsp;call &quot;Uncertain Deists&quot; ie they believe there's some sort of creative force, 
<BR>
&nbsp;but they don't call it anything in particular.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Yes, I am an atheist, and I don't tolerate quoters of idiotic psalms and 
<BR>
&nbsp;fundy claptrap, or allow people to try to &quot;convert&quot; me. I stop them quickly 
<BR>
&nbsp;by telling them Christianity is evil.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;But I am not the nasty sort who makes fun of people's deep seated hopes and 
<BR>
&nbsp;fears.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I do feel that most organized religions are destructive. However, I find 
<BR>
&nbsp;tolerance and love to be a far more effective tool when dealing with 
<BR>
&nbsp;*intelligent* people of differing beliefs from mine. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Then we move on to another topic. Life is too precious to spend it feeling 
<BR>
&nbsp;superior and smug. &gt;&gt;
