Robert write:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; As I've stated for may years (since my comments in the early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; '90's on sci.life-extension and bionet.molbio.ageing),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DNA damage accumulation *should* be part of aging.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I base this entirely on the observation that mutations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are known to accumulate and in single cells that get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amplified lead to cancer.
</EM><BR>
<P>By itself this observation doesn't seem to establish your conclusion.
<BR>
The fact that DNA is damaged, and damage accumulates, doesn't imply
<BR>
that it is a cause of the phenomenon that we call aging.  It could
<BR>
be that aging is caused by something else, and that while DNA damage
<BR>
would eventually lead to death, the symptoms and the time scale would
<BR>
be completely different from what we think of as aging.  Maybe you'd
<BR>
live 1000 years and then your cells would all turn to cancers.
<BR>
<P>There may be other reasons to believe that DNA damage is a cause of aging,
<BR>
but the mere fact that damage accumulates over time isn't enough.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, so long as the cloning is done in a way to remove the brains,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the ethical issues are specious, but this *does* raise the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point that you may have to do 30 clones to get one good one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (if you are interested in whole body transplants).
</EM><BR>
<P>As we've discussed before, intentionally producing brainless humans is
<BR>
not going to be considered by most people as a way to resolve ethical
<BR>
issues.  Rather, it raises a host of questions of its own.  Start off
<BR>
with Huxley's Brave New World and discuss whether that system, which has
<BR>
some similarities to this idea, is moral.  In particular, the epsilons
<BR>
are produced by poisoning their brains during development so they are
<BR>
nearly mindless, drooling automatons.  It's not a very attractive image.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It does however in my mind provide a significant amount of gravity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the DNA Damage theory as being a factor in the aging process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The developmental genes in an adult can accumulate mutations and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you will never know it.  But if you try to grow a new adult using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those genes with accumulated mutations, then the results detailed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; above are a likely result.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is it reasonable that as many as one cell in 30 has escaped harmful
<BR>
DNA mutations, so that it is in good enough shape to create a whole new
<BR>
organism from scratch?  These are ordinary cells that have been dividing
<BR>
and growing and metabolizing for a substantial fraction of the lifespan of
<BR>
the animal.  If DNA damage is the limiting factor, I would have expected
<BR>
ordinary tissue cells to be more than 30 times worse than the egg cells
<BR>
(which presumably have extra protection against damage).
