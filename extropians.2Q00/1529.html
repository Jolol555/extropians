<EM>&gt;He still is not allowed to use a computer, even since his release. He also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was invited to many computer security conference to speak. One was held on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;NASA property, NASA discovered this, and would not allow him on their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;property. (even though it is not illegal to have been convicted and to step
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on gov. property)

<P>It is unfortunate that Mitnick has become the poster boy for two different 
<BR>
factions.  For the feds, he represents all that is inherently evil in those 
<BR>
mysterious hackers who know more about computer tech than mere mortals.  For 
<BR>
the hacker sub-culture he represents all that is inherently evil in a 
<BR>
government which unfairly, unethically and unlawfully persecutes them 
<BR>
without just cause.
<BR>
<P>In reality Mitnick is probably neither as sinister or dangerous as the feds 
<BR>
portray him, nor as harmless and unfairly treated as the hacker sympathizers 
<BR>
portray him.  He just happened to be doing the wrong things at the wrong 
<BR>
time in history.  The one thing everyone seems to agree on is that he *was* 
<BR>
doing naughty things with his computers that caused him to run afoul of the 
<BR>
developing law of the 'net.  I think his story is chock full of lessons for 
<BR>
all.
