<P>I shouldn't jump into this, but I will, even though you're talking to Mike.
<BR>
<P>Have you ever traveled to the third world? Do you really think they live in 
<BR>
a free market society? (I dislike the term &quot;capitalist&quot;--the term was 
<BR>
coined by Karl Marx, who understood nothing about human capital.)
<BR>
<P>Poverty has multiple causes, not all of which will automatically be 
<BR>
eradicated by free markets. But governments usually make things worse. The 
<BR>
welfare system (especially in Europe) has perpetuated poverty by subidizing 
<BR>
it. State schooling which stifles competition for good education works 
<BR>
especially badly in poor neighborhoods. There's a clear correlation between 
<BR>
degree of education and income (though it's not perfect). Putting some 
<BR>
competition into the (pre-university school system would immensely help the 
<BR>
least well off gain real skills that can help them in life. It would also 
<BR>
make my part-time college teaching more fun. I'm frustrated that in 
<BR>
philosophy classes I have to first explain factual basics (whether in 
<BR>
physics, biology, or finance) before I can even tackle the philosophical 
<BR>
issues. The United States still has a rigid industrial style of education 
<BR>
in an information economy.
<BR>
<P>In the &quot;Third World&quot; (an increasingly outdated term), the state is usually 
<BR>
pervasive, or else fails in the job it has taken on of enforcing the rule 
<BR>
of law, thereby making markets ineffective, and making it hard to get out 
<BR>
of poverty--unless you can become one of the rulers.
<BR>
<P>Free markets are not the whole answer. Some unfortunate people do poorly 
<BR>
because of psychological disorders. Extropians of benevolent disposition 
<BR>
look forward to a time when medicine has advanced to the point where Prozac 
<BR>
and Zanax will look as primitive as ECT, and we can truly offer people the 
<BR>
chance to function effectively.
