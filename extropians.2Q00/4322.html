<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Any clue as to how the good doktor responded?  Come to that....how would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ANY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamentalist or even any professed christian or jew respond?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;No idea, and I don't even know if it was actually sent to her (though I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;imagine at least a few people have emailed it to her to make sure she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;got it). I'm sure fundamentalists are sure to start making noises about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the 'context of the time and place, etc' over this, if they dare say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anything.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually the fundie line is that that was a different &quot;dispensation&quot;.  Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the death and resurrection of Christ, we are now in the dispensation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;grace&quot; and those old rules that are *really* hard to live by don't really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; count anymore.  Granted there is nothing in the text of the scripture which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sanctions this, but come on we can't go around stoning our kids for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insubordination in this day and age, now can we?
</EM><BR>
<P>So what about the fun stuff in the new testament? You've got the
<BR>
anti-witch stuff, of course, so I'd like to know what the proper way is
<BR>
to 'suffer not a witch to live'? Do I crucify her (a Roman method
<BR>
reserved for political enemies and traitors) or burn her, or what? Then
<BR>
there are the anti-capitalist bits, like when Christ rampaged against
<BR>
the merchants in the temple (rather reminiscent of the degree to which
<BR>
the names of all the new sports stadiums are sporting corporate names,
<BR>
eh? Sports is the national religion, right? Notre Dame and all..) Then
<BR>
you've also got the part where Jesus tells his followers to sell their
<BR>
clothes and go naked in order to buy a sword. So S&amp;M is ok with God?
<BR>
Then there's the part of 'giving to ceasar what belongs to ceasar'. God
<BR>
fearing people shouldn't bitch about paying their taxes then. So the
<BR>
question is, how much belongs to ceasar?
