<EM>&gt; &gt; So people are still using Java?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Heh. Well, I know people who are learning Java, people who are teaching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Java, and people who are talking about Java. I've yet to find anyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has actually built anything with Java, aside from the personal toy-project
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuff we all do to evaluate new technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't get out much, and you certainly haven't checked the job
<BR>
market lately.  What do you think those 6-figure Java programmers
<BR>
are building, toys?  No, their building server-side distributed
<BR>
enterprize applications--the kind of software no one sees on any
<BR>
shelf, but that runs everything behind the scenes.
<BR>
<P>My current employer (OTS) subcontracts its service of printing
<BR>
bills--we print millions of bills.  We are the single largest
<BR>
consumer of the US Postal Service (yes, I do have some moral
<BR>
issues there:)  I write code for them in Java, that they use in
<BR>
critical applications (that I can't tell you about).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But it would be nice to be able to tell clients &quot;yes, we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communicate with Java if you ever decide to use it for something&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Its too bad Sun is so intent on maintaining a closed system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Implying that Java is a &quot;closed&quot; system is about 170 degrees from
<BR>
the truth.  Not quite 180, because Sun does retain the right to pass
<BR>
final judgment over the &quot;official&quot; status of new APIs, and they
<BR>
retain a trademark on the name.  But the Java platform itself is a
<BR>
100% public specification with no restrictions of any kind on its
<BR>
implementation or extension, with 100% freely available and
<BR>
redistributable reference implementations from Sun, 100% freely
<BR>
available source code from Sun, and 100% freely available and freely
<BR>
redistributable source code from several other vendors.  Anyone who
<BR>
calls that &quot;closed&quot; has an agenda other than the truth.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
