<P>Roger that John.  Its a question with which Ive struggled many years.
<BR>
Even now there is no way we can be sure we are not software, running
<BR>
some wildly complicated simulation in some cosmic computer.  Actually
<BR>
on second thought, that sounds kinda cool...  {8-]

<P><EM>&gt;   I have read that Sagan was quite the ladies man.

<P>The girl I dated at least once a week for 8 months and never had sex
<BR>
with that whole time would have done a lap dance for Sagan without
<BR>
being asked a second time.

<P>Seventh Day Adventist.  I got better.  {8^D  Altho I have been
<BR>
a stauch atheist for about 17 years, I still teach a class about every
<BR>
other month to the Palo Alto SDAs on their own church's history
<BR>
and doctrine.  They know my atheistic position, but invite me anyway.
<BR>
Go figure.  I see it as my way of doing community service without
<BR>
having to be arrested first.  {8^D

<P>I have heard countless stories like this.  My own experience is not
<BR>
so grim.  They were all pretty good folks, no worse than the ordinary
<BR>
proletariat.  I *liked* being religious, didnt want to give it up at all.
<BR>
My favorite notions were finally crushed by the sheer weight of
<BR>
a veritable mountain of evidence.
<BR>
<P>John, I spoke at length with my staunch SDA father-in-law this past
<BR>
weekend regarding cryonics.  The SDA religion is as far as I can tell,
<BR>
perfectly compatible with cryonics, one of the very few that
<BR>
are, thanks to their notion of the unconscious state of the dead.
<BR>
I think he will go for it, which is the key to getting my own wife
<BR>
to go for it, which might well be the key to my own survival of
<BR>
death.  She is the one most likely to be present at my own passing
<BR>
(I have no children and no immediate prospects of any) and
<BR>
so if she is not a believer in cryonics, then when I croak she might
<BR>
just decide 'aww to hell with it, the boney old geezer will never
<BR>
know if whether he was frozen or devoured by maggots, so
<BR>
why bother', etc.  But if her own beloved *parents* were frozen,
<BR>
perhaps she would be more careful with my corpse?  spike
