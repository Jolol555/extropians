<EM>&gt; I confess that I have no idea what the Extropian line is on this,

<EM>&gt; but I find it profoundly frightening.
</EM><BR>
<P>To the extent that there is such a thing as a party line, it is that
<BR>
regulation of genetic research should be minimal and individuals should be
<BR>
free to do anything that they like with their own bodies. The issue of using
<BR>
genetic engineering on unborn children is more complicated, but the general
<BR>
feeling seems to be that parents should be able to make their own decisions
<BR>
unless there is clear evidence that some particular proposed modification
<BR>
would be harmful to the child.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You may think that infringing your children's autonomy is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary evil. But -- *don't* think it doesn't hurt them: that way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lies madness. Please don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone *intends* to harm their children. We all love our children
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and want what's best for them. We so much want to help them that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sometimes feel compelled to take the decision out of their hands,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because we can't bear to think of them suffering as a result of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their mistake. But when we do that, we're infringing their autonomy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and doing them wrong.
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The arguments that show why it isn't right to do things to *gypsies*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against their will apply just as much to every other group of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people, including children.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with most of what you've said, but I think you've missed one
<BR>
important point. Just because the idea that 'group X is incapable of making
<BR>
their own decisions' has been abused in the past does not mean that it can
<BR>
never actually be true. Is simply means that we should err on the side of
<BR>
caution, and overrule an individual's preferences only when there is
<BR>
overwhelming evidence that said individual is incapable of making a reasoned
<BR>
decision.
<BR>
<P>If the case of teenagers it seems reasonable to suppose that the only thing
<BR>
they lack is experience in making their own decisions, so your reasoning
<BR>
applies fully. In the case of infants it seems equally clear that the
<BR>
capacity for even rudimentary decision-making has not yet developed, so it
<BR>
would make no sense to adopt a hands-off policy.
<BR>
<P>In the intervening years (age 2-12, more or less), things get complicated.
<BR>
It would seem sensible to adopt a policy of allowing a child to make
<BR>
decisions about anything that he can actually understand, but it is very
<BR>
difficult to know how far the capacity for understanding has developed at
<BR>
any given time.
