<EM>&gt; I personally live in one of the most dangerous cities in Europe: Stockholm.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You think it is strange? Well, Stockholm has in all its recorded history
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been a violent city. For instance, today Los Angeles has a murder rate of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about 10.8 murders on every 100 000 inhabitants, Stockholm has 10.2!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Stockholm is the only metropolitan area in Sweden though, so the average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crime rate is comparatively low. The violence in Swedish society is also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very much concentrated on specific segments of society. Most often those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segments that don't receive much media coverage. &quot;Bum A and Bum B met at Bum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A's ratty apartement and started drinking, then Bum B killed Bum A in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drunken stupor&quot;, is the average Swedish murder, nothing sassy to write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about. But the violence is very much present in Stockholm, and its expanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outside the usual segments of society.

<P>LA is a media city, so when Americans tell those of you elsewhere that America
<BR>
is most definitly NOT what you see on TV, we also mean that America is also NOT
<BR>
what you typically see in LA.
<BR>
<P>Here's a story that shows that LA is becoming more of a 'european' or
<BR>
'international' city every day, its had its own post-sports riot after the
<BR>
Lakers won the NBA championship:
<BR>
<P>Riot Erupts in L.A. After Lakers Win NBA Title 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Scores of people set fire to at least one police
<BR>
&nbsp;car, smashed other vehicles with baseball bats and flung bottles and rocks at
<BR>
&nbsp;firemen following the Los Angeles Lakers' victory over the Indiana Pacers on
<BR>
&nbsp;Monday night for the National Basketball Association (NBA) championship. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Witnesses said they saw police, on foot and on horseback, use rubber
<BR>
&nbsp;bullets and billy clubs to break up crowds as rioters pelted them with bottles
<BR>
&nbsp;and set trash cans ablaze. Firemen trying to extinguish a burning police car
<BR>
&nbsp;were struck with flying debris, witnesses said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Police kept fans, reporters and players inside the new Staples Center arena
<BR>
&nbsp;in downtown Los Angeles long after the game ended as they waited for
<BR>
&nbsp;disturbances and bonfires outside the facility to subside. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Lakers forward A.C. Green, one of those remaining at the Staples Center,
<BR>
&nbsp;said, ``This is crazy. It's no way to celebrate.'' 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;The Lakers' 116-111 victory gave the team its first NBA championship in a
<BR>
&nbsp;dozen years and was watched by many celebrities, including the city's No. 1
<BR>
&nbsp;basketball fan, actor Jack Nicholson. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Los Angeles police said hundreds of officers in riot gear were able to disperse
<BR>
&nbsp;hundreds of unruly people by midnight PDT with reports of only minor injuries. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;In one incident, officers fired rubber bullets to disperse a crowd that had
<BR>
&nbsp;gathered around a burning and vandalized patrol car, witnesses said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;A police spokesman said he could not immediately confirm that police had
<BR>
&nbsp;used rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;``I don't have the official report yet,'' he said, adding, ''We do use rubber
<BR>
&nbsp;bullets for crowd control.'' 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Shortly after the game, thousands of people who had gathered outside the
<BR>
&nbsp;arena began lighting bonfires, burning barricades and traffic cones, and
<BR>
&nbsp;dancing around the fires. One man burned an American flag. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;There were reports that eight vehicles were badly damaged or destroyed and
<BR>
&nbsp;worried police escorted the players out of the Staples Center in police cars. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Fans reportedly surrounded and rocked Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal's
<BR>
&nbsp;sport-utility vehicle as he was leaving the area. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Hours after the game, some members of the news media, along with some
<BR>
&nbsp;Lakers and Pacers players, fans and others, had not been allowed to leave
<BR>
&nbsp;the Staples Center. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey described the
<BR>
&nbsp;disturbance as ``very localized,'' and said there had not been any widespread
<BR>
&nbsp;trouble either downtown or in other areas of the city. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;``The city is relatively calm,'' said Humphrey. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;He said at least two people suffered burn injuries, but it was not clear how
<BR>
&nbsp;the injuries came about. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Among the celebrities who attended the game were film director Steven
<BR>
&nbsp;Spielberg, Nicholson, actor Dustin Hoffman, and actresses Salma Hayek and
<BR>
&nbsp;Whoopi Goldberg. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>What I don't get is why people are rioting for WINNING? Are they that scared by
<BR>
success? I could understand if they rioted for LOSING...
