<BR>
<EM>&gt; Not really, it is more like keeping mirrors of a server, to be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smoothly cross over in case the main one fails. Multiple redundancy is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an ancient tradition in mil/aerospace apps.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sorry to resort to hackneyed stereotypes, but IT people are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; familiar with computers, so it is probably a valid analogy. It is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the real thing when discussion uploaded copies, but it does come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty close.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a good analogy which works for me.  This sounds like a RAID array of
<BR>
disks, all mirrored to keep the same data, with duplicate input and output
<BR>
peripherals.  I think I agree with you.  In this case, I would claim that
<BR>
you only have one computer or OS running.  You have duplicated all the
<BR>
software and hardware, but by keeping them in synch you only have one system
<BR>
with redundant parts.
<BR>
<P>I think the semantics of the words are confusing us.  I agree with your
<BR>
descriptions of the examples, and your choices about what valid actions are
<BR>
allowed.  You call this killing a copy.  I would call this removing
<BR>
redundancy from a single entity.  I think you would agree with my examples,
<BR>
and my choices about what valid choices are allowed.  Where I would consider
<BR>
having a copy that could be killed, you would see diverged copies that are
<BR>
no longer true (exact) copies.  I think we are agreed on both examples, when
<BR>
to allow copy deletion and when not to.  I think we just disagree on the
<BR>
labels of these examples, to determine which examples should be called
<BR>
&quot;killing a copy.&quot;
