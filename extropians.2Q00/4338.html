<EM>&gt;     &gt; Not an option; most of MS is owned by public investors.  Gates' 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stake is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; vast, but he's very much a minority shareholder.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes, Bill Gates owns 20.8%, Paul Allen owns 5.8%, Steve Ballmer owns 4.8%,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and 37,882 other shareholders own the remainder, but direct confrontation 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wonderful benevolent  government  would  never work even if Gates owned 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;100%.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What Microsoft really needs is not better programmers but better lawyers, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a good public relations firm. For years Microsoft bragged that it was the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;large company that didn't have a lobbyist in Washington, government 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contracts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were never a big part of their business so they foolishly thought if they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;concentrated on business and did research to improve their products so 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually wanted to buy them then they'd be OK. They also displayed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arrogance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when they failed to debase themselves and show proper respect to Janet Reno
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when she tried to help by informing them of what the proper method of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;writing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;software was. Well Microsoft finally wised up so they do have a lobbyist in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Washington now, but it's too little too late, they're paying the price for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;learning how to play  ball with our saintly altruistic government.

<P>As an anarcho-capitalist, objectivist libertarian from the '60's on, it 
<BR>
pains me deeply to actually find myself even close to the same side of 
<BR>
things as Janet Baby-killer Reno, but the fact is that if you were really 
<BR>
aware of how badly the market has been served by the MS mob, and why, you 
<BR>
hopefully would never have made such silly remarks.  MS, to me, represents 
<BR>
the triumph of a fundamentally idealess moneyed yuppy oligarchy in using a 
<BR>
corrupt system to sell amazingly shoddy products to an ignorant market.  And 
<BR>
they didn't even invent that!
<BR>
<P>Apple, if anyone, started that whole ball rolling with their marketing of 
<BR>
the Apple II to the U.S. education market.  The Apple II was the WORST 
<BR>
possible choice for an &quot;educational computer.&quot;  It cost 3 times what the 
<BR>
Commodore 64 or Atari 800 did.  It had inferior hardware - with the 
<BR>
exception of its card slots, which meant more money and were only used in a 
<BR>
small minority of schools.  It had a truly primitive OS - if you could even 
<BR>
call it that, with no screen editor.  The kids didn't have it at home - they 
<BR>
had C64s or Ataris or TI's - which didn't require a college course to use.  
<BR>
But Apple figured out how to play that game.  They put the money into 
<BR>
MARKETING, instead of product or R &amp; D.  And because they managed to promote 
<BR>
themselves so well, the purchasing authorities felt SAFE in buying an Apple 
<BR>
II.   And hundreds of thousands of them ended up sitting in closets or 
<BR>
warehouses, often still shrink wrapped.
<BR>
<P>So IBM and MS just followed suit.  But then MS - and possibly IBM, from what 
<BR>
I saw - also used dirty tricks, including stealing software, such as the 
<BR>
compression system on DOS 6, for which they got successfully sued and had to 
<BR>
pay as I recall $120 million in compensation.  Similarly for the Dr. DOS 
<BR>
incident - but it succeeded in wiping out a superior OS, even if it did cost 
<BR>
them.  Don't outcompete, don't make a better product.  Just use the legal 
<BR>
costs, the rigged patent game - BUY them out and bury them...  This is the 
<BR>
kind of yuppy scum slease that I expect from our class of new oligarchs who 
<BR>
treat everything as negotiable.  I'm going to laugh my head off when they 
<BR>
finally run head-on into the real pros at that game in the near future - the 
<BR>
Chinese.
