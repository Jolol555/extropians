Hi!
<BR>
<P>Here's a small piece I took from my website:
<BR>
Clones have been produced from a 21-year old steer using quiescent cells
<BR>
[Hill et al., 2000]; scientists then made a new clone taking cells from the
<BR>
foetal clone and compared the percentage of successfully created clones: no
<BR>
difference was found. Using diving cells scientists took cells from a
<BR>
17-year old bull and allowed them to divide [Kubota et al., 2000]; they then
<BR>
used cells at different senescing stages to create clones and amazingly it
<BR>
appears that the older cells are more efficient. In another experiment,
<BR>
cells aged in vitro were not less efficient for cloning than non-aged cells 
<BR>
[Lanza et al., 2000], as had been previously reported [Cibelli et al.,
<BR>
1998].
<BR>

<P>You wrote:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Some fraction of the genomes harvested being &quot;good enough&quot; is sufficent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;explanation in my book.
</EM><BR>
<P>That argument fails to explain the equal difficulties in making clones
<BR>
taking cells from young donors. Perhaps the cell-types used are not the ones
<BR>
in which aging originates (to my knowledge neurons have never been used to
<BR>
make clones, perhaps aging originates in them); perhaps technical
<BR>
difficulties hide differences between young and old cells (optimizing the
<BR>
techniques might give ratios of success of, say, 50% for young cells and 30%
<BR>
for old ones). Also remember that Lanza's and Cibelli's technique claims to
<BR>
inject mtDNA; so you can't even say mtDNA mutations as the origin of aging
<BR>
in these cases. Of course that the experiments I know are cross-sectional
<BR>
studies but there is no reason to think longitudal studies on animal cloning
<BR>
will yield different results.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I know there is at least one company that does what you propose (they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; sent me some publicity a few months ago) but I really don't see the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; point in it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The point would be as a backup strategy for individuals who are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pessimistic about the harvesting of stem-cells that can be grown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into organs as you grow older or who believe that whole genome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;syn-cells or nanobot genome replacements are a long way away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Programmers try to look at all the possibilities.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Murphy's law thinking!
<BR>
<P>Best wishes.
<BR>
<P>PS: Robert, are you going to St. Petersburg's Congress on aging?
