<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Watched a TV program the other night on the efforts by cleaning and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;maintenance staff in Silicon Valley to earn enough to cope with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;explosion in rents and other prices in the area. The poor buggers seemed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;be working as hard as humanly possible
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;if they had value of themselves and their well being, and the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;willingness to rationally figure out how to attain goals which would make 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them happy, and then to actually ACT on the results, then they would have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more money and more happiness.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dazzling! Then the Oracle offices would never get cleaned, the lavatories
<BR>
would stink, and all the geniuses in Silicon Valley would die of some vile
<BR>
gastric lurgy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The simplest thing to do would be to move to someplace with lower rent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Another answer is to get a new job. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You're not paying attention here, buddy. Really. I'm talking about people
<BR>
who seem mostly to be migrants, who are doing the traditional heartbreaking
<BR>
migrant thing of investing their own miserable lives working their arses
<BR>
off doing the scutwork so their kids can go to school and get training for
<BR>
those better jobs. (Which might not be there in another couple of decades,
<BR>
of course.) 
<BR>
<P>Move to somewhere with a lower rent. In the Valley. I love it. They're
<BR>
already in garages and subdividing their tiny apartments. Be serious. 
<BR>
<P>It's perhaps easier to think this through by looking at the area's school
<BR>
teachers. They don't get paid enough to rent decent houses in such an
<BR>
inflated bubble world. Yeah, they could and maybe should move out, en
<BR>
masse. Let the cyber zillionaires send their kids to computer kindergarten.
<BR>
Oh, but it's the *market*, it's the *market*...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Will you tell me a bit about censorship in Australia?
</EM><BR>
<P>Each Australian has an allocated Censor, who attends every movie with you
<BR>
and covers your eyes or ears during the disturbing bits. The level of
<BR>
disturbance allowed to you has been established by E-meter at puberty. The
<BR>
Censors themselves are protected against moral danger by a committee of
<BR>
priests, ministers, rabbis and mullahs. 
<BR>
<P>Ahem.
<BR>
<P>Actually, I don't know - I don't earn enough to get to the movies much. For
<BR>
some reason, neither American nor Aussie publishers are buying young adult
<BR>
science fiction at the moment, so I'm going to need to hit the net with my
<BR>
stuff and bypass the oligopolies. It's all Harry Potter right now and no
<BR>
money left for much else, since fiction is marketed in the same way as
<BR>
toothpaste and toilet paper. Makes sense, it's the *market*, it's the
<BR>
wonderful wisdom of the *market*... No, of course that's grossly unfair,
<BR>
since as everyone here knows, what links the producer and the consumer in
<BR>
the West *isn't* `the free market', it's a bottleneck of corrupt little
<BR>
pishers (to use Courtney Love's nice recent phrase).
