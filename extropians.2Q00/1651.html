<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The idea that the poverty of the 30's was because people got too good at
</EM><BR>
growing
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; food that people could eat and too good at manufacturing products that
</EM><BR>
people
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could use is just too silly to debate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know how much you've read about the period John, but there was serious
</EM><BR>
overproduction,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and prices were far below profitable levels for many if not most farmers (i.e.
</EM><BR>
production
<BR>
<EM>&gt; exceeded demand). Food was not transported to market because it would have
</EM><BR>
cost even more,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; leading to even greater financial losses, it was left to rot, milk was drained
</EM><BR>
from vats, etc...
<BR>
<P>Mike, there was a shortage of money.  People had adjusted to inflation, and did
<BR>
their financial planning based on inflation.  Then the Fed decided that it
<BR>
wasn't going to lend money to solvent banks that were experiencing runs.
<BR>
Starting a panic that spread from bank to bank.  Causing banks to call in their
<BR>
loans. Suddenly, people were broke, business were broke, and there was no money
<BR>
to be had anywhere even at loan shark rates.  Crops rotted in the field because
<BR>
nobody had the short term money required to take food to the market.
<BR>
<P>The economy started to adjust.  Prices and wages deflated to match the supply of
<BR>
money, and business started to pick up.  But the Fed did another stupid thing.
<BR>
They decided it was time to shore up the dollar by increasing gold reserves, and
<BR>
reducing the money supply further.  For three years, every time the economy
<BR>
showed signs of recovery, the money supply was cut further.  And the economy
<BR>
could not adjust.  People learned to put off purchases knowing that what they
<BR>
were buying would be cheaper next year.
<BR>
<P>This process was finally stopped, but by this time, policies were put into place
<BR>
to keep wages and prices up.  And this blocked the economy from adjusting to the
<BR>
new money supply level.
<BR>
<P>Finally, boom times returned when the Fed started printing money to finance the
<BR>
war.  And the amount of money in the economy was brought into balance with the
<BR>
number of good available to buy.
