What's Hot!
<BR>

<BR>
<P>VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY LINKED WITH BOWEL DISEASES
<BR>
The Penn State team genetically engineered mice to have either Chron's
<BR>
disease or ulcerative colitis and a vitamin D deficiency. Some of the mice
<BR>
received vitamin D supplements with their food. The rest were not fed
<BR>
supplements. Those that received the vitamin supplements experienced less
<BR>
bowel inflammation and lived longer than the untreated mice. Those not
<BR>
receiving supplements began to die at seven weeks and more than half had
<BR>
perished by nine weeks. All of the mice receiving the vitamin were alive
<BR>
at the end of the study.

<BR>
<P>MICROMACHINES ON MEDICAL HORIZON 
<BR>
The April 14 issue of Science reported on new nanomachines which are able
<BR>
to detect defects in DNA, paving the way for improved diagnostics. Tiny
<BR>
silicon cantilevers that are less than 1/50 the width of a human hair are
<BR>
coated with biomolecules which have an affinity with certain proteins or
<BR>
DNA. As the DNA binds to the cantilevers, it causes the cantilevers to
<BR>
bend, which is detectable by laser beam deflection. Any slight defect in
<BR>
the DNA will be reflected in the way the cantilevers are bent. The
<BR>
discovery was made by scientists from the University of Basel and IBM.

<BR>
<P>RADIATION AND CHEMOTHERAPY CONTROLS HEAD AND NECK CANCER 
<BR>
Researchers from the University of Chicago Medical Center and Northwestern
<BR>
University treated 76 patients with three anticancer drugs and
<BR>
administered twice daily radiation therapy directed at the tumor bed for
<BR>
five days. Patients rested for nine days and repeated the treatment
<BR>
regimen, alternating the aggressive therapies with rest through five
<BR>
cycles. In the Journal of Clinical Oncology the team reported that 92
<BR>
percent of the patients obtained complete local control of the malignancy,
<BR>
but seven percent needed surgery at the primary cancer site.

Disease Therapy Protocols
<BR>
-------------------------
<BR>
<P>CROHN'S DISEASE 
<BR>
Crohn's disease can attack any part of your intestines from the mouth to
<BR>
the anus, but most commonly it strikes the ileum (lower portion of the
<BR>
small intestine) or the colon (large intestine). Ulcers form on the inner
<BR>
intestinal lining and eventually spread through the intestinal wall. As
<BR>
the affected part of the intestine becomes scarred and thick, the passage
<BR>
narrows, disrupting nutrient absorption and normal bowel function.
<BR>
The actual cause of Crohn's disease is unknown, but it may be an
<BR>
autoimmune disorder. The inflammation apparently occurs when the body's
<BR>
own immune system-for reasons not yet understood-attacks a part of the
<BR>
intestine. Some scientists are studying whether a virus causes Crohn's,
<BR>
but no specific viral agent has been identified. 
<BR>
Because most medications for Crohn's disease have an abundance of side
<BR>
effects, many patients understandably focus on nutrition and diet as a
<BR>
means of staving off active disease or helping to induce remission. To
<BR>
that end, omega-3 fatty acids from fish and flaxseed oils are said to help
<BR>
reduce inflammation. Flavonoids such as quercetin may also reduce
<BR>
inflammation. 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>EXERCISE ENHANCEMENT AND RISK AVOIDANCE 
<BR>
Despite mountains of data documenting the benefits of safe exercise, the
<BR>
public is largely ignorant of the molecular effects that overexertion
<BR>
places on the body in the short and long-term. This protocol will
<BR>
enlighten the physically active enthusiast about how to enhance the
<BR>
effects of exercise, protect against its negative effects, and increase
<BR>
energy levels so that longer workout periods are possible. 
<BR>
One study found that a group of runners who trained for a marathon but did
<BR>
not compete were much less likely to get upper respiratory infections than
<BR>
the runners who completed the race, showing how much such endeavors can
<BR>
take out of a person. The old saying, &quot;too much of a good thing...&quot; rings
<BR>
true with exercise also. Long term-repetitive and impactive exercise is
<BR>
also associated with cartilage degeneration, and that's the last thing
<BR>
people, especially older people, need. 
<BR>
Several studies have confirmed the damaging effects of ozone on lung
<BR>
function and yet more studies have found adding antioxidants reduces the
<BR>
power of ozone to damage lung tissue. Even the simple addition of vitamins
<BR>
C and E to the diet of trained cyclists was shown to improve lung
<BR>
function.

Product of the Week
<BR>
-------------------
<BR>
<P>SUPER ASCORBATE C POWDER
<BR>
Vitamin C is an important antioxidant, helpful in lowering cholesterol and
<BR>
preventing heart disease, improving immune function, maintaining healthy
<BR>
skin and blood vessels, accelerating healing, and reducing allergic
<BR>
reactions, and is involved in many other functions. Only pharmaceutical
<BR>
grade Roche Vitamin C is used.
