<EM>&gt; &gt; The foreign consortium

<EM>&gt; &gt; gambling.  I believe at the time the U.S. tax code did not require

<EM>&gt; &gt; Australians who place bets on U.S. lotteries to pay capital gains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; taxes to the U.S., but rather to pay them to their home country (at

<EM>&gt; &gt; least from what I recall in the Time or Newsweek article).  Of course

<EM>&gt; &gt; Australia had no capital gains tax on gambling winnings.

<EM>&gt; This is weird.  Is this recent?  I know an Australian guy who was in a

<EM>&gt; consortium several years ago to do just this

<P>IIRC, in the UK, you do not pay tax on lottery/gambling winnings ...
<BR>
<P>... because you have already paid income tax/sales tax on the stake you
<BR>
paid with.
<BR>
<P>(Think about it. Before everybody places their bets, tax has been
<BR>
extracted from their pocket. The gambling company itself pays some tax,
<BR>
too, IIRC. But the winnings aren't taxed. On the other hand, this differs
<BR>
from some other chunks of the UK tax regime -- for example, I'm informed
<BR>
by one of my pet real ale brewers that under some circumstances HM Customs
<BR>
&amp; Excise charge VAT (value added tax) on beer sold in pubs -- for which
<BR>
excise duty and VAT (on  the ingredients) was paid by the brewery.
<BR>
<P>Tax laws are weird. The only solution is to achieve an agalmic future --
<BR>
one which is so awesomely pervasively rich that money becomes irrelevant
<BR>
to most people's lives. (Want a fictional treatment? Go read some Iain
<BR>
Banks. Now _that_ is extropian ...)
