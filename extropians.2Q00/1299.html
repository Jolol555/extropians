<EM>&gt; &gt;  I'm kinda siding with Nadia on this one. Many prisons already have gyms,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  they do get used. Why not make the exercise machines such that the energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  expended is put to some use, since its already being expended anyways. Put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  incentive on it, make each kWh generated worth x amount of time off their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  sentence...heck I bet the prison system could produce some Tour de France
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  winners after a few years...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks, Mike.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; First of all, it was a comedian who suggested it, it ain't gonna happen for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; numerous reasons, most of them Politically Correct &quot;rights&quot; of the guys,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which I won't fight anyway..  slavery is illegal, even for convicts. There's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; historical precedent for that law.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, they get 20 cents an hour, so its not slavery, and anyways, you can pay them
<BR>
all you want so long as their pay gets garnished to fund the state Victim's Fund,
<BR>
so they are just paying off restitution.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Who gives a good goddamn if some nerd think it's not going to pay out,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dollarwise. Do inmates weigh out dollar wise these days? Gimme a break. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; costs almost 50,000 dollars a year per death row inmate or some such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nonsense. (my source is dubious it's from Ice -T's book but it wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surprise me if it was true).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Harvard costs less!
</EM><BR>
<P>Harvard is also far more discriminating in who it allows to go there....you pay
<BR>
them to go there. Jail is free for the convict.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The most important thing is, making guys ride a bike a huge pain in the ass,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and those guys are so lazy. And if it generates power or runs the TV's or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever, it's making them useful -- which is what most of them lack anyway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -- a purpose.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hitching the bikes up to the TV is a good idea, take advantage of, and help
<BR>
manipulate the prison pecking order. The bullies will make the wimps ride the
<BR>
bikes so the bullies can watch tv, then the wimps will get more fit than the
<BR>
bullies and will kick their asses and make them ride the bikes....;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Listen, If they knew that instead of hanging' with the homey's trading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cigarettes and candy bars and getting in fights, that it'd be some kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; endless bike marathon, prison would not hold the appeal that it does. I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; serious, guys are lazy!
</EM><BR>
<P>And if you make them wear pink leotards while they are doing it, they'll like it
<BR>
even less... ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  And it does hold appeal, believe me. Brought into a  world that is racist,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hostile towards illiterate and  poor youth (of any race) - where the best job
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can hope to get might be some kind of  fast food so you can work your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whole life to open up your own business reupholstering or cleaning houses,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BUT where the MOST likely outcome is being shot on the street (either by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cops or by some other bored kid) jail holds a kind of security.  You don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get shot in jail, usually. And you get fed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Plus talk about having no self responsibility! They tell you when to eat,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when to shower, when to go to the bathroom...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No one would admit to wanting to be in jail, but the guys I work with have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dads in there, and they are pretty darn comfortable with the idea of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seventeen years to life.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I'd giver prisoners a choice: go to school or ride the bikes... you'd
<BR>
see some studious convicts really fast...
