<EM>&gt; &gt; He goes into it later in the post. I personally can't dissagree witht
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the logic either, even though I'm libertarian, I'm a libertarian of very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Spartan sentiments. A man who has nothing worth dying for has nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  worth living for, IMNSHO. People who refuse to enlist or be drafted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  ought to be stripped of citizenship, as far as I am concerned. If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  are contientious objector, thats fine, you can serve in the medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  corps or some other non-combat role. I would prefer people that are that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  honest about their opinions than those who are a) cowards, b) too stupid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  to understand that the best place to hide from a war is often in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  military. You are much more likely to be killed or injured if you are a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  draftee than if you join up. When you join up voluntarily you have some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  control over what you actually wind up doing, which can minimize your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  risk as much as you care.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ok...now explain the  viet nam war (into which I was forcibly associated) in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relation to the above sentiments..
</EM><BR>
<P>If you had declared yourself as a contientious objector, the closest to
<BR>
combat you could serve is as a combat medic (which tends in the end to
<BR>
make you change your mind about things like that). If you were smart at
<BR>
the time, you would have seen the odds, and enlisted in the Air Force,
<BR>
the Coast Guard, the Air National Guard, or the Navy voluntarily, and
<BR>
had some control over what job you got, and even stayed out of Vietnam
<BR>
altogether.... A buddy of mine who was a Vietnam vet told me that one
<BR>
time the selection guy at the draft center went down a line of sorry
<BR>
draftees pointing at each in turn and just saying: &quot;Army, Army, Army,
<BR>
Navy, Marines, Army, Army, Army, Navy, Marines....&quot;  Draftees are
<BR>
typically targeted for the infantry, i.e. cannon fodder, though those
<BR>
with intelligence do sometimes get weeded out for real jobs.
<BR>
<P>I personally don't think that the baby boomer's general opposition to
<BR>
the draft had much to do with principle, it was merely a snivling case
<BR>
of cowardice in general. Most of these kids had been told by their
<BR>
parents that their parents had fought WWII so that junior wouldn't have
<BR>
to fight again, that kinda crap. Their opposition to the war had more to
<BR>
do with their personal opposition to being drafted. You'll notice that
<BR>
kids spent more time in college then than before or since. This isn't
<BR>
something new. Isaac Azimov did the same thing during WWII, and wound up
<BR>
getting stuck in research.
