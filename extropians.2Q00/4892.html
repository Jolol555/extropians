<BR>
<EM>&gt; One of the philosophical objections sometimes raised here against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immortality is that you would change so much over a long lifespan as to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have little relation to the being you were originally.  In that case,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the original person is really gone, just as surely as if he had died.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All that is left is someone who was influenced, perhaps only marginally,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the person who began the process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A way to address this would be to make a commitment to honor the beliefs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and desires of your older selves, to think of yourself as not just the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person you are today, but also as a representative of the hopes and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plans of the people you were in the past.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This wouldn't mean that you could never change, only that as you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do change, you would remember the person you used to be.  Even as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your tastes, desires and beliefs change, you would continue to at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least occasionally do things the way your old self would have wanted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You would cultivate a sense of connectedness to your past and future,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; put down roots into your own timeline.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This could give you a more optimistic perspective as you move into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a future which offers many opportunities for drastic transformation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can have confidence that your future self will not forget who you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; today, that even as you change you will preserve an element of stability.
</EM><BR>
<P>How about this:
<BR>
<P>&quot;I am awesome compared to what I have been, and pathetic relative to
<BR>
what I will become.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Continual self-improvement.  As you live, seek what aspects of yourself
<BR>
can be made better, and make them so.  Nothing is spared, not even your
<BR>
means of judging what is better.  However, there is the chain of
<BR>
continuity, such that at any point in your life, you can trace the
<BR>
decisions you have made to alter yourself from whatever you were, and
<BR>
see how the changes - given the information you now have, and possibly
<BR>
alterations in the world around you - are, indeed, justified from the
<BR>
initial set of values.
<BR>
<P>This may also give you an ability to spot any forming defects: if you
<BR>
can not trace the chain, and if what you are would be abhorrent to what
<BR>
you were if given the knowledge and circumstances that are currently
<BR>
yours, then there may have been some error in the chain.  But you can't
<BR>
just use old values by themselves - if you have received information
<BR>
that has changed your values, then what you were plus that information
<BR>
would result in similarly changed values, and it is *that* by which you
<BR>
must judge your current self.
<BR>
<P>Nothing is guaranteed stable, and you are not limited in how you may
<BR>
change - but you are still yourself, even if every molecule in your
<BR>
body has been replaced many times, and even if you now support some
<BR>
things which you used to oppose or vice versa.
<BR>
<P>Or: you will exist in the future.  What you say and do now will be
<BR>
remembered, and used to influence future actions - if not your words
<BR>
and deeds as an individual, then as a statistic, one behavior out of
<BR>
many in various historical models.  Would you rather leave the
<BR>
interpretation of such completely to others, or would you rather be
<BR>
there, such that you might possibly have a chance of explaining how
<BR>
things really were, rather than the inevitably incorrect interpretations
<BR>
reached by people whose only other source of information is an
<BR>
incomplete historical record?
