<P>
zeb, I think your concern that other parties might adopt Green Party
<BR>
provisions is well-founded. I hate to say this, because I love my home, but
<BR>
I think the time may be coming pretty soon when the only sensible thing to
<BR>
do is to leave the US. The big question is where to go.  There was a little
<BR>
discussion of this a few days ago.  I think I'll do some heavy duty research
<BR>
on the question.  It's possible that such considerations as existing medical
<BR>
facilities should have a relatively low priority, since that's a deficiency
<BR>
that can be corrected.  If the US moves towards many of the Green Party
<BR>
provisions, I guarantee there won't be decent medical care here. I have a
<BR>
friend who got pneumonia when she was in Moscow and had to go into a
<BR>
hospital there.  In this large city, they were still using medical
<BR>
techniques that were common in the US at the beginning of the 20th century.
<BR>
That's the kind of progress we have to look forward to here if this country
<BR>
follows Nader's inspiration.
<BR>
<P>Oh yeah, everyone in the US better learn how to grow their own food, too.
<BR>
Green Party plans to kill agriculture along with industry.

<EM>&gt; One more thing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you want to practice any kind of life extension which involves gene
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; therapy or cloning, you'd better learn to do it yourself.
