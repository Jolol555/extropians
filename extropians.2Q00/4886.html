<P><EM>&gt; Do you assume that your own brain was feminized in utero, even though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your body (evidently) wasn't?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know.  It certainly seems that way, subjectively... like it is &quot;hard
<BR>
wired&quot;  but I suspect that it would seem that way even if it is software
<BR>
rather than hardware.
<BR>
<P>As an explanation, the &quot;mistimed hormone wash resulting in a cross sexed
<BR>
brain&quot; has a certain appeal... but that doesn't mean it's actually true.
<BR>
<P>In the long run, it doesn't matter.  I accept what IS and deal with it in as
<BR>
extropian a way as possile.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you think that those people who choose to switch later in life (several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of my gfs and old pals are now elective lesbians, after years of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heterosexuality) must always have been pre-wired to make the move?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sexuality and sexual orientation can be almost as divisive a topic as
<BR>
religion or politics.  My own thoughts are that most humans have the
<BR>
capacity to be bi-sexual though generally one type of attraction is
<BR>
dominate.  The number of purely heterosexual or homosexual individuals is
<BR>
relatively small.
<BR>
<P>I do believe that sexual orientation is pre-programed... And the most common
<BR>
program is &quot;anything that moves&quot;.
<BR>
<P>In the case of the &quot;elective lesbians&quot; you mentioned, there are several
<BR>
possibilities.  The best way to find out is to simply ask them.  It could be
<BR>
that they had always been attracted exclusively to women but were too scared
<BR>
to admit it before.  It could be the are actually bisexual and simply tired
<BR>
of putting up with males at this point (it isn't easy, given the average
<BR>
male out there), or it could have come as a total shock and delight to them
<BR>
that this shift has happened.
<BR>
<P>I do believe the queer political community downplays the role of free will
<BR>
and choice in it's official stance on sexual orientation... just as much as
<BR>
their opposites, the religious right, overplay them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems to me perhaps as dangerous a preconception as the purely socially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constructed variety. I *do* think we, or some of us, have the ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expand or specialise our sexual desires, up to a point.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think most of us do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (I personally can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find it imaginable to feel gay desire, which narrows my chances dismally.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But marooned on Mars with the other guys in an all-male crew, maybe I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually get more sentimental about my buds...)
</EM><BR>
<P>It's possible.  Given the incidence of homsexual encounters among &quot;straight&quot;
<BR>
men in isolated all male populations, I'd say it's even probable &lt;G&gt;.
<BR>
<P>I think you should go slow though... don't even think about sex with another
<BR>
man at this point, rather consider finding a person who is someplace between
<BR>
male and female.
<BR>
<P>Know any?
<BR>
