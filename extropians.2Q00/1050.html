<P><EM>&gt;&gt; The assertion that &quot;real&quot;, art must be an object is wrong. Extropic art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; eschews the rigid idea of art as object and explores various forms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;creativity, bioengineering, performance, conceptual art, virtual reality,
</EM><BR>
new
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;film media, nanotechnology, ideas, etc., as valid mediums. It must.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good point.
<BR>
<P>(snip)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;yet much art is created with the eye to disenfranchise the eye of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;general populace. Abstract artists tend to really excell at trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disconnect the audience from understanding.
</EM><BR>
<P>Abstract artist were following the vogue trend of the arts and sciences at
<BR>
that time.  Regardless of the seemingly remote stance, abstract artists
<BR>
purposefully tried to create a communication with those who took the time
<BR>
to learn the language, the terms and the meaning of their work.  I think
<BR>
that this is quite powerful.  Instead of the audience looking and pictures
<BR>
passively, it required that the audience think for themselves and
<BR>
communicate with the art.  Many people did not want to do this because it
<BR>
took too much time or effort, but those who did fully understood the
<BR>
concepts of Abstract Art and Abstract Expressionism.
<BR>
<P>(snip)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I can answer this one: because when those of us who are technically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;astute but not aethetically astute take a look at contemporary art, too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;often we feel like we are being asked to wear the emperor's new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clothes..
</EM><BR>
<P>If a person doesn't have the talent to be aesthetically astute  - why not
<BR>
at least knowledgeable about aesthetics?  Can you imagine an extropian
<BR>
future without aesthetics?  Oh my.  On the flip side of this coin, I can't
<BR>
imagine existing within an extropian community and not learning the terms -
<BR>
the language - of the current and future sciences and technologies.   
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As they say in the movies,&quot;I'll see it when it comes out on video.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Either way, you would be experiencing art -:)
