<EM>&gt; &gt;  You want to end welfare?  OK, so do I.  But you have to give people the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  means with which to make their own way in the world.  If I'm ignorant, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  poor, uneducated and unskilled and you kick me and my kids out into the streets 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  to starve, you have de facto turned me into a criminal.  I will rob
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  everyone in sight.  I will soon be caught and put in jail then,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  guess what?  Free room and board on your dime again.  Nice solution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True. Social services fill a need and are provided because most people can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see the cause and effect of the spending vs. the state of affairs. This is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the big dumb-dumb factor of Libertarian politics. It ignores causation. It 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asserts that &quot;things will work themselves out&quot; as soon as we stop 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interfering. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I am not necessarily saying that all the welfare cases should be cut off
<BR>
cold and kicked into the street.  What I am saying is that if the
<BR>
government had a good solution to offer, we wouldn't have a problem right
<BR>
now; they certainly haven't solved anything after trillions of dollars
<BR>
and generations of time.  As long as government is involved, it will have a
<BR>
vested interest in maintaining the status quo, nevermind its theoretical
<BR>
mission.
<BR>
<P>I have one important observation from having been on that
<BR>
side of the tracks:  Private, local aid is at least an order of magnitude
<BR>
more effective than government aid.  This is because local charities and
<BR>
private aid tends not to give &quot;rubberstamp&quot; aid like the government. 
<BR>
Instead, they tend to provide targetted aid that is more carefully matched
<BR>
to the real needs of people in their community.  Also, local private aid
<BR>
often creates social pressures and novel opportunities that encourage
<BR>
change in those receiving the aid, something that government aid is very
<BR>
poor at accomplishing.  People have a vested interest in improving
<BR>
the health of their local communities.
<BR>
<P>So my argument isn't so much that we should abolish all charities, but that
<BR>
we should put the job of providing charity back to private individuals in
<BR>
local communities instead of through the government.  One of the best ways
<BR>
to do this is to stop taxing the hell out of people simply so that the
<BR>
government can supply its mediocre, ineffectual, and largely wasteful
<BR>
&quot;charity&quot;.  Private organizations could be many times as effective for a
<BR>
small fraction of the money and I believe history bears this out.
<BR>
<P>In other words, I am a libertarian because I *do* care.
