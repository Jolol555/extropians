<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; If I'm Microsoft, I can tell Dell to ship a copy of Office with every PC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; or I'll decline to license them my OS and put them out of business.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That isn't force. Besides, it is a power that absolutely must exist if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are to have anything even resembling a free market. If a business can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decide the terms under which it will sell its product, you've pretty much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gutted competition. The result will be an anemic, dysfunctional market that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;invites even more intervention.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it isn't force. But what's wrong with drawing an analogy between
<BR>
physical force and economic force: both can reduce the efficiency of a
<BR>
market by artificially restricting choice. Microsoft certainly isn't
<BR>
going to shoot me if I don't buy Windows, but in an unregulated market
<BR>
they can make it infeasible to do otherwise. More importantly,
<BR>
allowing them to do so engineers a fitness function where size and
<BR>
brutality are selected ahead of price and quality. Do we want a
<BR>
product to do well because it's tied to something, or because it best
<BR>
fulfills some sectors needs?
<BR>
<P>And it's absurd to equate antitrust with a system where government
<BR>
arbitrarily interferes with every contract and the terms of every
<BR>
business agreement. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; If I'm IBM and I don't like something your startup is doing, I can do a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;search on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; my patent database, find a couple of dozen you could plausibly be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; violating, and - right or wrong - bankrupt you in court.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Here you have a valid point, but the problem isn't with the market. Rather,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is the fact that the U.S. civil justice system is badly broken. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;solution is to fix the justice system (with a looser-pays rule, penalties
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for filing frivolous lawsuits, or other such measures).
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd agree with you here, that was probably a bad example. I'd add
<BR>
though that reforms in intellectual property law might provide an
<BR>
optimal solution to natural monopolies in the software industry: 5
<BR>
year copyrights, for instance, would allow a vendor to make a
<BR>
reasonable return on development investment while lowering the barrier
<BR>
to entry for competitors to something surmountable. This year, for
<BR>
instance, we'd be seeing the first wave of Windows 95 derivatives. MS
<BR>
would have a huge head start, as they should, but we'd actually start
<BR>
seeing a bit of diversity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; In the long run, as they say, we're all dead. Just because a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; can't last forever doesn't mean it can't do a lot of damage in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; mean time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My point is that the traditional approach to 'solving' these problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually makes them worse, because it short-circuits the mechanisms that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would normally act to erode monopoly power. I don't object (in principle) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the idea of fixing problems where they occur, but I want the solution to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually be an improvement over leaving things alone.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a valid argument - regulation could help, but government can't
<BR>
be trusted to do more good than harm. I live in a rent controlled
<BR>
apartment but I'm ambivalent about whether that does any good or it
<BR>
just discourages new housing construction. It seems though that
<BR>
letting an owner charge a new tenant whatever he wants then
<BR>
restricting the pace at which he can increase it is a reasonable
<BR>
compromise. You try to approximate the best of both worlds, find a
<BR>
working medium between equally compelling arguments.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The true test of any system of rights is whether it protects the people that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no one likes. If Microsoft can be subjected to arbitrary, senseless (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expensive) penalties just because it is unpopular, then so can anyone else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the public doesn't like. Since I qualify as a member of at least a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;half-dozen unpopular groups, I find that a rather ominous trend.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you find not being able to yell fire in a crowded theater an
<BR>
ominous trend? There's nothing arbitrary or senseless about the
<BR>
ruling, disagree with it though you might. Whether it's expensive, or
<BR>
whether it'll just be another MS stock split, only time can tell.
<BR>
<P>-matt (Is this as bad as the gun debate? I can't tell from the inside...)
