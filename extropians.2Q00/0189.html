<EM>     &gt;&gt;Quantum Encryption, which has actually been used in a commercial setting
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;&gt;not just in the lab, is as secure as the laws of physics.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>  &gt; *That* is news to me.  Do you know where I can find out more about this
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; quantum encryption?
</EM><BR>
<P>I found an old post that I wrote on this subject and sent  to the list on May 3 1996:
<BR>
=============================================================
<BR>
<P>With a random One Time Pad you can generate a perfect encryption scheme,
<BR>
even if your opponent has a computer of infinite power  he can never read your
<BR>
message. Despite this it has severe practical limitations, how do you
<BR>
distribute the One Time Pad to the person you want to talk with? You can't
<BR>
receive the pad electronically, if your electronic channel is not secure then
<BR>
an eavesdropper can tap your line and get a copy of the pad, if your channel
<BR>
is already secure then you don't need the pad. The only secure method is to
<BR>
physically hand a disk with the pad on it to the person you want to talk to
<BR>
and then hand him another one when that one gets used up. That's not practical
<BR>
in most cases, certainly not for Crypto Anarchy in an economy biased on
<BR>
anonymous electronic money.
<BR>
<P>Public Key Cryptography solves the key distribution problem but at a (small)
<BR>
price, it is breakable in theory but probably not in practice. In a year or
<BR>
two it will be expensive but possible to break a 512 bit key, a 1024  bit key
<BR>
would be astronomically more difficult. Many users of PGP have a 2048 bit key,
<BR>
even with Nanotechnology there is not enough matter in the observable universe
<BR>
to make a machine that can break a key of that size before the heat death of
<BR>
the universe, or the Omega point whichever comes first. We can be absolutely
<BR>
certain that a 2048 key will never be broken.. unless..
<BR>
<P>Unless P =NP and somebody finds a way to improve existing factoring algorithms
<BR>
by a lot. An improvement by a measly few hundred trillion percent would by
<BR>
useless, I said a lot. This doesn't seem very likely, but there is one other
<BR>
possibility.
<BR>
<P>Unless Quantum Computers are possible and somebody actually manages to build
<BR>
one. (Such a machine would revolutionize the world so much that breaking your
<BR>
PGP key would probably be the last thing on your mind, but let's ignore that
<BR>
for now.) Would this mean the end of Crypto Anarchy? No, because we can use
<BR>
quantum mechanics on our side too, we can use Quantum Cryptography, and unlike
<BR>
Quantum Computers we know this will work because it's already been done.
<BR>
This is how:
<BR>
<P>I send you a bunch of photons, each photon is polarized in one of 4
<BR>
directions, horizontal, vertical, left-diagonal and right diagonal, - | \ / .
<BR>
In this example I send you 10 photons polarized as follows
<BR>
| | / - - \ - | - / .
<BR>
<P>You have a polarization detector, you can set your detector to measure the
<BR>
horizontal and vertical photons (+) OR you can set it to measure the
<BR>
left-diagonal and right diagonal photons (x). The laws of physics do not
<BR>
allow you to measure one photon both ways, because measuring one destroys
<BR>
all information about the other.
<BR>
<P>You set your detector at random, let's say you set it to find rectilinear
<BR>
photons and let's say you have guessed correctly and it really is a
<BR>
rectilinear photon. If you can detect the photon after it passes through your
<BR>
polarized material, you will correctly deduce that it is a horizontal photon.
<BR>
If you can not detect a photon after it hits your polarizing material you
<BR>
will correctly deduce that the photon is vertical.
<BR>
<P>What if you guessed incorrectly when you set your detector, what if you set
<BR>
it to detect a rectilinear photon but I send you a diagonal polarized photon?
<BR>
Then the photon will hit your polarizing material at a 45 degree angle so
<BR>
there is a 50% chance the photon will get through, a 50% chance it will not.
<BR>
In other words you get a random result.
<BR>
<P>I send you 10 photons polarized as follows                        | | / - - \ - | - /
<BR>
At random you set your polarization detector as follows   x + + x x x + x + +
<BR>
So you might claim the photons were polarized as follows / | - \ / \ - / - |
<BR>
<P>Now you tell me over an insecure channel how you set your detector for each
<BR>
photon, Big Brother is free to listen in, it won't help him. I tell you over
<BR>
the same channel which settings on you polarization detector were correct, in
<BR>
this example settings number 2,6,7 and 9 were correct    * | * * * \ - * - *
<BR>
We only use those readings  and junk  the others , and we agree that
<BR>
horizontal and right diagonal photon means 1, and vertical and left diagonal
<BR>
means 0. So we have sent the number 0011 and we can be as certain as we want
<BR>
to be that there has been no  eavesdropping.
<BR>
<P>An eavesdropper can not know what type of photon is being sent and just like
<BR>
you must guess what direction to set his polarization detector. He will be
<BR>
wrong 50% of the time and when he is he will change the polarization of the
<BR>
photon and give himself away.  We compare N bits in the string of numbers
<BR>
sent over an insecure channel, if  there are no discrepancies then there is
<BR>
only one chance in 2^N that somebody is eavesdropping, so we can use the
<BR>
remaining bits as a one time pad. As I said this  has already been done and
<BR>
messages have been sent about 35 miles in this way.  I learned about this
<BR>
stuff mostly from Bruce Schneir's  wonderful book  &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot;.
