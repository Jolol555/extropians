&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;My $0.02: though I agree with almost all of your post (i.e.: addressing
<BR>
&nbsp;ideas, not people; responding to issues objectively etc.) I personally find
<BR>
&nbsp;no reason *not* to be polite.  I can't think of any conversations or
<BR>
&nbsp;correspondances I have had which have suffered as a result of inherent
<BR>
&nbsp;politeness.  Come to think of it, most correspondances have been enhanced
<BR>
&nbsp;by politeness, in my opinion; (but that *is*, after all, just my
<BR>
&nbsp;opinion...criticize at will). &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>Everyone has an opinion....here's mine..
<BR>
<P>Politeness is good.  I'm in favor of politeness. 
<BR>
<P>In fact...I'm reminded of an incident related to me lo these many years 
<BR>
(decades) agoby a co-worker.  He  was in a CW (country AND western.....both 
<BR>
kinds of music) bar.  Just minding his  own business. (In dallas texas in the 
<BR>
late sixties) when a &quot;damnyankee&quot; (his words) started mouthing off to some 
<BR>
cowboys.  Very shortly thereafter they drug him(the yankee) out by his heels. 
<BR>
&nbsp;It doesn't pay to be rude to cowboys.
<BR>
<P>So the tale goes.  I beleive it probably happened.  My personal experience 
<BR>
indicates that &quot;every day discourse&quot; (a new jersy freight dock comes to mind) 
<BR>
would constitute &quot;fighting words&quot; in (texas, wyoming, montana) many parts of 
<BR>
the country.  
<BR>
<P>Politeness is a survival characteristic many places I've traveled.  Rudeness 
<BR>
is not.
