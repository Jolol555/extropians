<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The whys and wherefores of this are sufficient to fill a book, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; basically boil down to &quot;first-past-the-post electoral systems with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; no constitutional safeguards suck&quot;. (Or rather, they only provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; representative government when there's a relatively homogeneous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; population. And the UK has been becoming increasingly, radically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; diverse since the end of the 1950's.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Its still lily white compared to the US.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just a short note: Michael, wanna come to Yugoslavia?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Enjoy!!
</EM><BR>
<P>What Yugoslavia? Doesn't exist. Calling what is left an actual country would be
<BR>
like continuing to call Russia 'the Soviet Union' after all of the other
<BR>
republics broke away. What left is a rump, a stump, a little fabrication of a
<BR>
nation that does little but give one hoolum authority to be a major pain in the
<BR>
ass.
<BR>
<P>The former Yugoslavia has, I beleive a significant sectarian violence level that
<BR>
cuts along religious/ethnic lines, partly due to who sided with whome during
<BR>
WWII, and partly due to who raped and killed who under the Ottoman Empire prior
<BR>
to WWI. Can you say Jannissaries?
<BR>
<P>Such an analogy is much like wondering why there is so much violence in Rwanda.
<BR>
They are all the same color, right? Sorry, that doesn't cut it. There is more to
<BR>
diversity than just color in most societies, even in the US. For example, the
<BR>
Jewish families of western european descent tend to (not as much as they used to
<BR>
but it still occurs) look down on Jews of eastern european descent.
