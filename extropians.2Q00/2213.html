<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Of course, you can't do that. Also, you don't mention which modelling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;paradigm you're contemplating, say QM or MD.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Exactly - it's like thinking you could emulate a P2 on a P2 and end up with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; something faster. The implication therefore is that you can't model the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; universe in anything smaller than the whole universe, which is why I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; understand why someone would claim you could simulate everything with a star.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Given the constraint of perfect fidelity (if indeed that means anything), then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which paradigm you work in is just a bookkeeping issue.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ok, I have a question that is leaving me confused. What exactly is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; role of compression within simulation situations? If I can represent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (i.e., model) a set of information perfectly with a compressed form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that information, then haven't I modeled something larger with something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smaller? 
</EM><BR>
<P>You can store a state of the model in compressed form; you can work on
<BR>
the compressed version too (perhaps expanding parts in turn to work
<BR>
on). 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For example: I can model 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 with 2 *
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5. I've compressed a ten digit, multiple addition operation with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; single multiplication of two digits operation. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This would then seem to scale up for many things, indeed, even to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; size of the universe. Is there something I'm missing here?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you probably get caught out by a practicality - that although a
<BR>
particular state of your simulated universe may be compressible enough
<BR>
to store, with the savings afforded by compression making enough room
<BR>
for your simulation and compression code, there will always be some
<BR>
complicated states of the simulated universe which will not compress
<BR>
sufficiently. Compress 1 + 1.... to 2 * 5. Compress 2 * 5... to 10.
<BR>
<P>Now compress 137329.13759712722327137211872722334816576157 and leave
<BR>
enough space for your code when you're done.
<BR>
<P>Oooh... what if the computer running our universe was relying on the
<BR>
fact it compressed it all - if things get too complicated, *poof* ...?
