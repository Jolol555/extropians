<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Thats probably about as close to a racist remark as a liberal feels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; comfortable with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>As a liberal among liberals, I have to comment. Liberals usually ARE racist. 
<BR>
It's a different kind of racism -- looks like white guilt -- about feeling 
<BR>
superior and privileged... 
<BR>
<P>These rather uncomfortable conflicting emotions (If we are all equal why do I 
<BR>
feel BETTER than someone, why am I privileged, etc.) cause a different kind 
<BR>
of racism. 
<BR>
It's pure class racism in sanctimonious America, where we aren't supposed to 
<BR>
have class systems...
<BR>
<P>This kind of racism is what spawned the program being discussed. Welfare. 
<BR>
This simultaneously supplies the privileged class with a sense of relief that 
<BR>
they helped someone, while demeaning and degrading the beneficiaries. No only 
<BR>
does it keep people in their place, but it produces lethargy, resentment, and 
<BR>
repulsion for the system, assuring that the lower classes stay exactly where 
<BR>
they should -- down and out and untrained. also keeps the military supplied 
<BR>
with a large class of expendable units, and ensures that people won't revolt. 
<BR>
It has backfired and created a huge situation of animosity and hostility on 
<BR>
both sides.
<BR>
That is why even liberals today are saying the welfare system need to go. 
<BR>
They just aren't hard-nosed about it because they still care, and still have 
<BR>
that guilt.
<BR>
<P>I am not saying libertarians and conservatives are NOT racist, they are, just 
<BR>
a little more obvious and ruthless about it.
