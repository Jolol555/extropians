<EM>&gt;Robin, I'm curious as to how social science views the decline in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;birth rates that is expected to lead to balanced or declining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;populations in &quot;developed&quot; countries in the not-to-distant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future?
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;views&quot; is bit too vague for me to respond to concretely.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Is there any &quot;law&quot; of social science that says
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individuals must always reproduce?
</EM><BR>
<P>No. I made an analogy to the physics claim of finding new
<BR>
resources so bountiful that the resources we see would be
<BR>
uninteresting.  It is logically possible, but seems unlikely.
<BR>
Similarly it seems logically possible that reproduction will halt,
<BR>
as we know of no law that requires reproduction, but it seems
<BR>
similarly unlikely.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Is there any reason they could not self-impose a completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;balanced population policy?
</EM><BR>
<P>If they all want to they might.  But if only most of them want
<BR>
to it looks much harder.  And the question is why they would
<BR>
want to.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you assume that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there are diminishing returns to expanding (due to increasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;delays in thought times) and increasingly diminishing returns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to reproducing endlessly (because most of the interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;combinations have already been tried and you have to think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more and more to come up with interesting things to create),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then it would appear that though you may have ever-growth, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;may occur at increasingly slower rates over time.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not see that this conclusion follows from your assumptions.
<BR>
Nor do I yet accept your assumptions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I think &quot;social&quot; science only works at scales that are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at the largest and smallest limits.
</EM><BR>
<P>One might make a similar claim about physics, that all we know
<BR>
is irrelevant because we haven't yet seen physics on the
<BR>
smallest and largest scales.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Past economic growth has relied on colonization of &quot;larger&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scales (e.g. the &quot;new&quot; world).
</EM><BR>
<P>Attempts to find the economic growth impact of discovering the
<BR>
new world have failed -- it seems to have not mattered much. See:

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you have arguments or sources that discuss how social science
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;operates when it *knows* it is at the scale or efficiency limits,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I would be interested in reviewing them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually most economics models describe this situation, and it is
<BR>
the exceptional models that explicitly consider changing technology.
