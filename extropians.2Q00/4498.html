<P>
You make a good point here, and I'm trying to think of a way to earn more
<BR>
money without giving up too much of the lifestyle I love. So far, my
<BR>
experience has been that when I want something I'm able to get it one way or
<BR>
the other--not always by spending money.  Sometimes I barter; other times I
<BR>
work out a way to enjoy assets without owning them.  For example, I kept an
<BR>
airplane for my brother for a couple of years while he was away.  He didn't
<BR>
want to take it with him, and it was better for the plane to be flown than
<BR>
to just sit.
<BR>
<P>I've talked to my friends a lot about the value of liquid assets a person
<BR>
must have available in order to feel comfortable.  It varies quite a bit
<BR>
from person to person, which I would have expected.  But here's something I
<BR>
found really interesting:  people who tend to save money for some undefined
<BR>
future expenditure (as opposed to saving for some definite purchase such as
<BR>
a boat) also tend to never feel really &quot;safe,&quot; no matter how much they
<BR>
accumulate.  Now I have to confess I don't have any close friends who are
<BR>
billionnaires, so maybe once you hit the billion mark you feel safe.  I
<BR>
doubt it, though, based on what I've seen of people whose net worth is in
<BR>
the millions. Another thing I've noticed is that once a person goes into
<BR>
debt above an amount that can be repaid within a year or so, the debt tends
<BR>
to grow to the point where most of the person's income goes to service the
<BR>
debt.  Long-term house mortgages, which were uncommon until the mid-20th
<BR>
century, are a major cause of a decline in the quality of life for most
<BR>
Americans IMO.

<P>If I optimized my life for maximal pleasure, I am quite certain that I
<BR>
could live on an order of magnitude less money than I currently earn.  The
<BR>
downside is that doing so would create an unnecessary resource limitation.
<BR>
In fact, what you are describing is a resource stasis of sorts.  My
<BR>
interest in money is only to the extent that I can fund cool projects that
<BR>
interest me in the future.  I view simple living largely as a way to
<BR>
promote wealth and well-being -- a means rather than an end.  My
<BR>
curiousity and ambition would never be satisfied unless I was involved in
<BR>
some type of hill-climbing behavior.  I just pick my hills more carefully.
