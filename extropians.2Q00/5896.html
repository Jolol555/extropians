<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Aargh!  Just as we're being accused of anti-Semitism, Mike goes and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; blames the Jews!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Mike, do you have any evidence for this assertion?  Are you really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; claiming that the Jews are behind this attack on the Extropians?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Please post some hard evidence.  Otherwise, you are just reinforcing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; these accusations.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since half my family is jewish, accusing me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of anti-semitism is pretty stupid.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not in the slightest. You're assuming one can't be anti-self --
<BR>
clearly an invalid assumption (cf. &quot;suicide,&quot; and, more
<BR>
relevantly, &quot;conversion&quot;) -- thus, the notion of the
<BR>
&quot;self-hating Jew.&quot; Small point.
<BR>
<P>I didn't find your post anti-Semitic in any significant way, if
<BR>
at all.
<BR>
<P>One of the things about discussing anti-Semitism that's so
<BR>
frustrating for me is that a level of subtlety is required than
<BR>
many aren't willing to ascend to. So one's anti-Semitism filters
<BR>
get tuned far too coarsely: what counts is only something either
<BR>
very obviously hateful (&quot;Kikes suck&quot;), or something that fits a
<BR>
simplistic formal (such as grammatical) criterion, &quot;Jewish X do
<BR>
Y,&quot; as in your statement, Mike.
<BR>
<P>Jews do bad things. One should be able to say that without being
<BR>
labeled an anti-Semite on the grounds of the statement alone.
<BR>
<P>If your post had come out of the blue, then the absence of
<BR>
statements about Italian-American liberals or Irish-American
<BR>
liberals might be evidence for possible anti-Semitism, but your
<BR>
statement was clearly addressing a question that had nothing to
<BR>
do with other liberals.
<BR>
<P><P>Because so many Extropians are educated less in the humanities
<BR>
than the sciences, it may be difficult to discuss this question
<BR>
fruitfully here. We'd have to discuss at least a bit of Luther,
<BR>
if not the early Church Fathers. And for many here that might
<BR>
involve a lot of tedious reading of dusty texts.
<BR>
<P>And who the Hell wants to do that?! Once we stop aging, we can
<BR>
get to philosophy, history and such. :)
<BR>
<P>(Of course, there won't be Judaism anymore at that point,
<BR>
because the big hyper ai-unity will have sucked up everything
<BR>
into itself, and thus there'll never be a minion.)
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
Brian.
