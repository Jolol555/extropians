<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;  But Im a *yuppie* nerd.  {8^D
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So what does that make me?  A red-neck/ex-jock/neo-yuppie/psuedo-nerd 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; /bookworm neebish geek couch potatoe?  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Polymorphism is a very extropic characteristic in my opinion.
<BR>
<P>I actually do the same kind of genre hopping quite seamlessly, so I know
<BR>
what you mean.  In fact, people who are used to me as one easily
<BR>
identified group often show quite a bit of surprise when they see me in
<BR>
one of my other natural guises.
<BR>
<P>I think my primary modes are:
<BR>
<P>1) Red-neck, rancher, outdoorsman stereotype with all the trappings:  I
<BR>
own a big American off-road truck, own a remote Nevada ranch, have guns,
<BR>
etc.   
<BR>
<P>2) Deep technology geek.  I can spend days discussing technological
<BR>
esoterica at length and my love of this stuff knows few limits.  No
<BR>
description is really necessary on this list.   
<BR>
<P>3) Trendy, underground, electronica music scene type.  I am not merely a
<BR>
wallflower; I am actively involved.  When I am exercising my musician
<BR>
side, this is where I live. 
<BR>
<P>These three are probably the ones that I can very easily slip in and out
<BR>
of like a chameleon and which come very naturally to me.  What I find
<BR>
interesting is that many people consider my different lifestyles to be
<BR>
*necessarily* mutually exclusive, although that probably just shows a
<BR>
lack of imagination on their part.  I have other strong interests (martial
<BR>
arts, fine wine, fine restaurants, active athletic schedule, interesting
<BR>
travel, etc), but they don't really qualify as lifestyles in my opinion
<BR>
(although taken in aggregate, they could possibly be classified as
<BR>
&quot;yuppie&quot;).  
<BR>
<P>I can't imagine living a life as only one person.
<BR>
