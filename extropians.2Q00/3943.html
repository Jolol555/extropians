<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Natasha, what good is there to Pollock's work other than the novelty it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;presented in its time?  This is not a rhetorical question.  I'd really like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to know.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Pollock's name is associated with the introduction of the All-over style of
<BR>
painting which avoids any points of emphasis or identifiable parts within
<BR>
the whole canvas and therefore abandons the traditional idea of composition
<BR>
in terms of relations among parts. The design of his painting had no
<BR>
relation to the shape or size of the canvas -- indeed in the finished work
<BR>
the canvas was sometimes docked or trimmed to suit the image. All these
<BR>
characteristics were important for the new American painting which matured
<BR>
in the late 1940s and early 1950s
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;When you view one of his paintings, what goes through your mind?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Are you emotionally moved?  Inspired? Delighted? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Though my mind?  -- Freedom on expression, moving beyond boundaries (the
<BR>
edge of the canvas), and music.  Let me explain by way of experience:  My
<BR>
father was an art director for Young &amp; Rubicon in New York City and also a
<BR>
painter.  I spent much of my childhood in museums and galleries as well as
<BR>
around musical performances.  In one house that we lived in, my father
<BR>
cleared all the furniture from the dining room, and spent several days in
<BR>
that room painting and listening to music.  He was immeasurably inspired by
<BR>
Pollock and the painting he produced in that room was on the dining room
<BR>
floor and in the style of Pollock.  It was fantastic!  Beautiful!
<BR>
<P>My father was a serious and highly competitive &quot;ad man&quot; in  world of
<BR>
advertising in the most commercially sophisticated city in the world -
<BR>
Manhattan (&quot;dog eat dog,&quot; he used to say.)  He felt constricted in that
<BR>
world, the pressure was enormous.  He found freedom in abstract art and in
<BR>
the style of Pollock: dancing with the paint - swinging his arm in rhythmic
<BR>
motion as he swirled paint from the paint bucket across the floor -- as an
<BR>
extended canvas welcoming color, shape and form. 
<BR>
<P>Many years later, when I was working on my final project for an
<BR>
undergraduate degree, my father had lost a large part of his creativity --
<BR>
from the many years of pressure.  I invited him into my studio to paint
<BR>
with me.  He never felt that freedom of expression again because he worried
<BR>
to much about whether he *understood* what he was doing, rather than doing
<BR>
it.  As I wrote in another post last night, Ray Kurzweil and Mihaly
<BR>
Csikszentmihalyi discussed creativity on a TV program about  &quot;Creativity&quot;
<BR>
and mused on the necessity of moving beyond boundaries and taking chances -
<BR>
doing something different - putting information together in ways that are
<BR>
unique.
<BR>
<P>When I look at Abstract Art, I do not look at it or see it as most viewers
<BR>
because I am studying the design, the positive and negative space, the
<BR>
relationship of colors and shapes to each other, the overall design
<BR>
quality, the painterly quality (if it is a painting), etc.  It the design
<BR>
&quot;works&quot; I am moved.  
<BR>
<P>There is much written about Abstract Art and Actionism which can be found
<BR>
on the Internet.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Am I mistaken in thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that one aspect of art is communication?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I don't think so.  My work as an artist is to communicate ideas and
<BR>
feelings, reflections, concerns and joys.
