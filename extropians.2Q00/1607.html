<EM>&gt; &gt; The Unionists are Irish by your definition ... and non-native, by your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  previous definition. Which do you want to use?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, it's clearly a question of native by birth (in this case you can be a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Native New Yorker and be Jamaican) or by heritage. I understand the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference, why would you pretend not to? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I'm not &quot;pretending&quot; anything; I'm just highly pissed off with a common
<BR>
American reaction -- to blame one side for a civil war, when both sides
<BR>
are pretty much evenly to blame (judging by the number of murders).
<BR>
<P>The hard men with the guns are all a bunch of bloodthirsty clowns, and
<BR>
we'd all be better off without them. But arguing that the problem is
<BR>
&quot;British imperialism&quot; is to reduce it to an absurd proposition. Sure,
<BR>
the original invasion of Ireland in the 17th century was reprehensible.
<BR>
Sure, the actions of the settlers' descendants since then were also bad.
<BR>
But pulling the British government out of the North right now isn't going
<BR>
to fix that; it's just going to make the UVF start on a rampage of ethnic 
<BR>
cleansing, and make the pIRA or the cIRA or whatever they call themselves
<BR>
this week retaliate in kind.
<BR>
<P>There seems to be a cultural assumption ingrained in a lot of Americans
<BR>
that in any conflict, there must be a bunch of goodies and a bunch of
<BR>
baddies, and all that is necessary is to identify the good guys and side
<BR>
with them. This is one struggle where the bad guys are distributed
<BR>
evenly on all sides -- if you want to root for someone, root for the peace
<BR>
process and the politicians sitting around the negotiating table and
<BR>
_talking_ to each other about how to get _all_ the guns and bombs off the 
<BR>
street. Those guys understand that any peace settlement has to be 
<BR>
multilateral; even the British government has accepted that proposition
<BR>
(since Margaret Thatcher was forced to quit).
