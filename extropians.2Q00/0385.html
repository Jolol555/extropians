<P><EM>&gt;If you are going to have *mandated* organ donations, then the estate

<EM>&gt;presumably you aren't *really* dead yet) as while you are, &quot;on ice&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so to speak, someone has borrowed the use of your organs.  When
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you are reanimated, can you request that they be returned? 
</EM><BR>
<P>It's hard to estimate timelines for this, but with the rapidly moving work
<BR>
on stem cells etc, and the first-draft genome now finished by Celera,
<BR>
growing and replacing `borrowed' organs shouldn't be as much trouble as
<BR>
rejoining a severed head. It seems to me that the main issue is whether
<BR>
gutting a corpse prior to freezing would (1) interfere with preservation
<BR>
protocols, and/or (2) require the body to be held for too long at
<BR>
temperatures that are merely chilly but not chilly enough for later
<BR>
revival-with-memory. 
<BR>
<P>We kinda assume that we're looking for renovation as well as resuscitation
<BR>
post mortem, so popping in some self-cloned organs in 20 years shouldn't be
<BR>
a problem. And if nanomedicine does its Moore's law thing, all this could
<BR>
be moot anyway. And in the Spike happens around the same time as
<BR>
cryo-resurrection day, it's more than moot. And... Combinatorial explosion.
