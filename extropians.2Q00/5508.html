A Christian is afraid you'll go to Hell. An atheist is afraid you'll make 
<BR>
hell on Earth to save him from the Hell that doesn't exist. Try reading &quot;A 
<BR>
Skeleton in God's Closet&quot;, although it may be hard to find (I borrowed it 
<BR>
from my church). The crux of the book is that an incredibly talented and 
<BR>
obsessed atheist engineers evidence proving Jesus was not resurrected. His 
<BR>
motivation was to destroy religion because it was holding back humanity 
<BR>
(ironically the suicides he wound up creating were incalcuable and when he 
<BR>
was exposed the Church was almost entirely vindicated and achieved a 
<BR>
popularity rivalling the martyrdom of early Christendom). On both sides more 
<BR>
than enough pavement for Hellfire Construction, Highway Division. ;-}

<P>&quot;I have no problem with Christ, but in my experience many Christians are not 
<BR>
very Christ-like.&quot; - The Dalai Lama
<BR>
<P>&quot;Q: Is Eris true?
<BR>
A: Everything is true.
<BR>
Q: Even false things?
<BR>
A: Even false things are true.
<BR>
Q: How can that be?
