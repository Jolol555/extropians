<EM>&gt; &gt;The simplest thing to do would be to move to someplace with lower rent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Another answer is to get a new job.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You're not paying attention here, buddy. Really. I'm talking about people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who seem mostly to be migrants, who are doing the traditional heartbreaking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;migrant thing of investing their own miserable lives working their arses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;off doing the scutwork so their kids can go to school and get training for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those better jobs. (Which might not be there in another couple of decades,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of course.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure what you're saying - are migrants incapable of improving 
<BR>
themselves in the way you or I have? Do you not see this as condescending? 
<BR>
&quot;no - you don't understand what kinds of people they are&quot;. And I don't 
<BR>
understand how sacrificing for their children would make it neccesary to 
<BR>
move to someplace with high rent.
<BR>
There's a catch-22 - is it possible for someone to be implicitly superior to 
<BR>
anyone else, via genetics or whatever? I believe that, no it is not. In rare 
<BR>
cases, such as mental retardation, someone is at a natural disadvantage, but 
<BR>
the fact that some retarded people are able to get jobs and make a decent 
<BR>
living shows that the disadvantage is not as pronounced as you would think. 
<BR>
And if I am wrong, and it is possible that anyone is superior to anyone 
<BR>
else, then you would expect and want it to be reflected in differences in 
<BR>
income.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Move to somewhere with a lower rent. In the Valley. I love it. They're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;already in garages and subdividing their tiny apartments. Be serious.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would I have meant in the valley? I'm not talking about next door. Maybe 
<BR>
out of the valley?
<BR>
There are a lot of Mexican immigrants here in Utah, and a great job market. 
<BR>
If I were moving from Mexico to the US, I would pick Utah. Nevada is nice as 
<BR>
well. Unfortunately, due to a minimum wage, a lot of the ones without a lot 
<BR>
of education cannot find entry level job legally. If they're illegal 
<BR>
immigrants, they couldn't anyone. Solution: slowly increase immigration 
<BR>
quotas until they exceed the actual amount of immigration, then do away with 
<BR>
them, while slowly lowering the minimum wage until it is zero.
