<P>Ooooppppssss, Spike, you mean the Cubans and North Korean's I presume...
<BR>
I suppose you could consider China communist, but that rope is slipping.
<BR>
<P>I'm also unsure whether these are private (wholly) Russian satellite owners.
<BR>
Press releases I've seen indicate the companies are European or U.S. based,
<BR>
though they may be renting Russian satellite time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  However, I am against the public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; surveilance that is already in place as well, with the exception of very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; limited things like the cameras that focus on ATM keypads.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can you think of *any* other places where you *want* cameras?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just having cameras at the ATM prevents or greatly reduces the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probability of someone from robbing you, does it not?   spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, if Spike has the standard deviation from the norm of experiences
<BR>
he suggested in a previous message, I know where *I'd* like a camera...
<BR>
Perhaps Steve Martin's &quot;Wild N Crazy Guy&quot; has taken possession of Spike?!?
<BR>
I mean, who is the only person on the list who has actually been *trying*
<BR>
to attach little cameras to little aircraft?
<BR>
<P>You gotta wonder.
