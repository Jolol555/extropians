Education is not equivalent to software development, at least, not using any
<BR>
current methodologies of software development
<BR>
and not creating any kind of resultant state that I'd call educated.
<BR>
<P>Current software development methodologies create very rigid sets of
<BR>
instructions to be followed, and these instructions are
<BR>
not adaptive to their environment.   A learning system must be able to
<BR>
adapt, and the closest thing that exists to this right
<BR>
now is Genetic Programming (a'la John Koza).  It is interesting to note that
<BR>
while the act of pedagogy is provided by outside
<BR>
actors, the actual act of learning is self-deterministic.  That is,
<BR>
programming someone is not teaching, because it they are
<BR>
not self-determining and the sets of rules they are being given are rigid
<BR>
and inflexible.  A learning sytem can take suggestions,
<BR>
and there are ways to force the issue (brainwashing, in humans) to make one
<BR>
learn something, but just writing a few thousand
<BR>
lines of code telling a system how to do a particular activity is not
<BR>
teaching.  A learning system must be adaptable to at least
<BR>
some new situations without reengineering.
<BR>
<P>However, it would be interesting to augment our existing brains, which are
<BR>
much better at learning various things than any
<BR>
current computing technology, with even sets of rigid instructions.  I would
<BR>
be quite interested to be able to have a full array of
<BR>
mathematical libraries on a chip in my mind, which I could then recall at
<BR>
will, requiring that I not memorize many complex
<BR>
mathematical formulae and their solutions, but rather only how to apply
<BR>
them - and recall them from the library, and have the
<BR>
computer solve them, at will.  Currently, I must program this sort of thing
<BR>
into Mathematica or Matlab or C or whatever in a very
<BR>
cumbersome manner - just thinking about it would be much nicer :-)
<BR>
<P>I suspect if we could have electronic dictionaries in our heads, our natural
<BR>
language facilities would do a much better job
<BR>
of completing translations than existing machine translation systems.  By
<BR>
having quick recall of dictionary mappings from one's
<BR>
native language into another, one could at least conduct conversations in a
<BR>
stilted version of the other language, which so far
<BR>
is orders of magnitude better than the very poor, non-real-time NL
<BR>
processing done by computers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: a new thread
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any thoughts on human genetic manipulation?  Say, with the purpose of
<BR>
creating a workable interface between an electronic microprocessor and a
<BR>
human mind?  Throw in some nanotechnology for physical interaction...
<BR>
Education equates to software development...  Implications?
