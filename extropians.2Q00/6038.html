<P>&lt;&lt; Can somebody help me?  I always thought that Mussolini was a fascist due 
<BR>
&nbsp;to his having split with the communist party over the Italian communist 
<BR>
&nbsp;leadership refusing to play up to the Italian WWI veterans.  On the other 
<BR>
&nbsp;hand the German leadership at that time were the Nazis or National Socialist 
<BR>
&nbsp;Party and not Fascist at all.  My reference for this is what I remember of 
<BR>
&nbsp;the history of that time and Frederick Von Hayek's book THE ROAD TO SERFDOM.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I am hearing that term thrown around in ways don't suggest those 
<BR>
&nbsp;definitions at all.

Its currently used as a generic term. That's how I used it. Mussolini's brand 
<BR>
of National Socialism was not the worst by a long shot. What you end up 
<BR>
doing, I feel, is quibbling. Perhaps, I might've used Ethnic Cleansing  or 
<BR>
Ethnic Cleanser as a term? Frederick Von Hayek was a very cool thinker and 
<BR>
his works will resonate for centuries to come. But Fascist is &quot;as defined by 
<BR>
myself for this list&quot; is predatory, white racist, provocation. There is also 
<BR>
the risk of using lists like these as covers for the peddlers of National 
<BR>
Socialist memes. Only vigilance will fight it.
