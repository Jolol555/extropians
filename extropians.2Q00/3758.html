Wireless ecommerce is the big buzzword today.  There are all kinds of
<BR>
trade shows, conferences, startups and press releases on the subject.
<BR>
This is said to be the next big thing, with huge rates of growth and
<BR>
massive amounts of business coming soon.
<BR>
<P>I know a lot of us spend time thinking about the future.  Can someone
<BR>
explain to me what forms wireless ecommerce might take, on a grand scale?
<BR>
<P>I try to envision shopping on my cell phone or wireless PDA, and it
<BR>
doesn't sound very attractive.  Could this really take over a significant
<BR>
fraction of the purchases I make today?  Presently I buy some things
<BR>
in stores, and some things online, but I don't very often find myself
<BR>
walking around and wanting to buy something online.
<BR>
<P>Adding to that the fact that mobile platforms have to be compact, and
<BR>
therefore the display area is limited, the shopping experience can't
<BR>
provide much in the way of quality and pleasure.  Looking at the world
<BR>
through a window the size of a deck of cards is not going to be an ideal
<BR>
way to shop for goods, it seems to me.
<BR>
<P>What am I missing here?  Is it all hype?  Plenty of companies are putting
<BR>
big bucks into it.  Or is the growth mostly expected in the business
<BR>
arena, where a mobile sales force needs access to real time connectivity
<BR>
to the corporate net?
<BR>
