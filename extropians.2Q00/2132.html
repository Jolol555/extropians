<P><EM>&gt; Politeness is a survival characteristic many places I've traveled.  
</EM><BR>
Rudeness 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is not.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, survival.  A logical move.  It's a good way to test the water before you 
<BR>
jump in and sling mud!
<BR>
<P>[In fact when I sited individuals on the list with whom I was diametrically 
<BR>
opposed to ideologically, but said still they acted like gentlemen, I was 
<BR>
specifically thinking of you and Mike.]
<BR>
<P>What this achieves is that I listen to your opinions with a far more open 
<BR>
mind, and look for ways in which we *agree* - rather than searching for the 
<BR>
things we don't.
<BR>
<P>Because I do not favor dogma, many people think that because I find fault 
<BR>
with one part of the &quot;party line&quot; I am against every part of their program. 
<BR>
For example: I don't favor more gun control laws, just stricter enforcement 
<BR>
of the existing ones, and more personal responsibility in sellers and 
<BR>
handling. And I am in favor of legalizing all victimless crimes. And I back 
<BR>
Microsoft all the way, they have my vote. But I am not in favor of child 
<BR>
labor or withdrawing educational funding or stopping housing and food 
<BR>
programs for the poor and handicapped and old until a new system is in place. 
<BR>
Unless you can assure me that I won't be one of those in need of aid. I ain't 
<BR>
rich enough to be a libertarian, boys. And I still get free lunches .....hmm. 
<BR>
today's was free. In fact I get one tomorrow again! 
<BR>
; - )
<BR>
Politeness buys us all a chance to learn more about each other's POV - and 
<BR>
learn. Which I hope makes us both more educated about our opposing views -- 
<BR>
and perhaps we're a little the better for knowing each other?
