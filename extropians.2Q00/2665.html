Damien Broderick criticized:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I orginally began by saying that I'd limit the scope of Shakespeare's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;quote that &quot;... there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;so.&quot;  Thus far, I've only been extending its scope to include good/bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;beliefs, suggesting that *everything*, *all* discourse falls prey to this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hamlet wasn't talking about truth vs falsity, but about evaluative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statements:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ham. Denmark's a prison.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Ros. Then is the world one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Ham. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Ros. We think not so, my lord.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Plainly, the world is *not*, as a matter of fact, a `prison'. But it feels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like one to Hamlet. His feelings, he points out, are not open to disproof,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as a claim of fact might be. Wily Rosencrantz remarks astutely that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proximate *cause* of Hamlet's `thinking' that `makes it so' is his ambition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which he might abandon if he chose) - thus at once confirming and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; undermining Hamlet's solipsistic assessment.
</EM><BR>
<P>You suggest that Hamlet's claim applies only in certain &quot;evaluative&quot; areas
<BR>
of discourse, and that it might not apply in other situations, like in
<BR>
discussions of &quot;matters of fact.&quot;  But TRUTH is an evaluation of a
<BR>
sentence.  Being &quot;correct&quot; is a matter of adhering to the correct ethics,
<BR>
whether it's an ethic of action or an ethic of belief.  We talk of
<BR>
justification in both cases; the &quot;justification&quot; involved is strictly
<BR>
analogous, since in both cases, we have no algorithm of justification to
<BR>
evaluate our algorithms of justification.  Implied in saying that Denmark
<BR>
is *not* a prison is that Hamlet *shouldn't* believe that.  (At least, not
<BR>
literally, not analytically, not when he's engaged in proof-games, or
<BR>
whatever.)
<BR>
<P>I actually don't take Rosencrantz to be very wily here; rather, I find his
<BR>
reply impotent.  Ambition isn't really the sort of thing we CAN just throw
<BR>
off if the mood strikes us, any more than you could just throw off the
<BR>
belief that Denmark is a prison.  We need to be convinced; while we play
<BR>
an important role in our being convinced, one can't just decide to give up
<BR>
a belief that way.  (Though you CAN choose not to act on the belief.)  So
<BR>
what, we might ask Rosencrantz, if Hamlet's imprisonment IS caused by his
<BR>
ambition?  What possible action does THIS piece of psychology suggest?
<BR>
<P>Similarly, my original post was in response to the idea that death is only
<BR>
bad because we think it is.  I now ask you to stop believing that death is
<BR>
bad for the next fifteen minutes, to hold no opinion on the matter for the
<BR>
next five minutes, and then to restore your current beliefs about death
<BR>
after those twenty minutes are up.  Can you do it?  *I* sure can't.
<BR>
<P>Taking a pragmatist's view, Rosencrantz may be &quot;right&quot; in the game he's
<BR>
playing, but his advice is totally irrelevant to the game Hamlet happens
<BR>
to be playing.  It provides Hamlet with no consolation, no course of
<BR>
action, and nothing which might convince Hamlet that he is actually wrong.
<BR>
<P>Hamlet makes himself right.  So do we.  Does this suggest that we ought to
<BR>
change something?  Not to me.  I still believe that death is bad
<BR>
unqualifiably, that the world is not a prison, (except when I'm engaged in
<BR>
poetry,) and that statements made in one language-game have little or
<BR>
no bearing on statements made in another.  I've got to play my own game.
