<EM>&gt;  &gt; Surveillance has *nothing* to do with freedom.  You are free now to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No, of course not. Nothing at all. Slavery is freedom.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is like the umpteen millionth time someone has posted &quot;slavery is 
<BR>
freedom&quot; in these surveillance threads.  And it still has just as little 
<BR>
persuasive power as the first time.  For the future, assume that everyone on 
<BR>
the list assumes that you have read _1984_.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Currently, you can do a lot of perfectly innocuous, but illegal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;things, which won't result in any persecution, because no one will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ever find out about it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly my point.  *All* criminals rationalize their crimes (&quot;I had to rob 
<BR>
that store in order to survive&quot;; &quot;She deserved to be raped, look at the way 
<BR>
she was dressed&quot;; &quot;Of course I cheat on my taxes, I don't agree with what 
<BR>
Uncle Sam spends my money on&quot;, etc. etc.)  So merely because you rationalize 
<BR>
your crimes as being &quot;innocuous&quot; does not deprive them of their illegality.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Do you want to make many people miserable, you included? Then, vote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for transparent society.
</EM><BR>
<P>I, like most law-abiding citizens, have absolutely nothing to fear from a 
<BR>
transparent society.  If your deeds are good, you have no interest in 
<BR>
keeping them secret.  If you are willing to fight tooth and nail to keep 
<BR>
your deeds hidden..., well do the math.
<BR>

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
