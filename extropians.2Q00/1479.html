<EM>&gt; The really shocking thing was that a high percentage of the prisoners had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never been to trial, or even had a single hearing before a judge.  Many of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them had been incarcerated for years without receiving a single hearing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How had this happened?  Well, they had been assigned a public defender at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the outset.  (Often, THE public defender, as many counties had ONE attorney
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to handle hundreds of &quot;defences.&quot;)  Their &quot;attorney&quot; waived the time limits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - there goes the right to a speedy trial - and then refused to take their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calls.  Can you say hapless?  Hopeless?  Helpless?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Like, who needs black helicopters, etc.???

<P>Any computer nut ought to know the story of Kevin Mitnick, who, after
<BR>
five years in prison, most of that in solitary, without a trial,
<BR>
supposedly because he was America's cyber enemy number one, who
<BR>
supposedly caused millions and millions of dollars in damages, wound up
<BR>
getting an additional six months when he finally got a trial and was
<BR>
released this past January. Guess what the actual damages the government
<BR>
could actually document that he did? $4,000.00.
