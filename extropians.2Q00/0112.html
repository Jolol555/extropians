<EM>&gt; &gt; This is why I state that such technology is USELESS without an overall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; total surveillance system that covers the entire surface of the earth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Without a Big Brother syste, the alleged increase in crime fighting that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; surveillance provides is ephemeral, or easily countered.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's being installed today, in the UK, with widespread public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support. (Not from me, I should like to add.)  It's fallible, sure,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but with the best part of a million surveilance cameras a year being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installed in public places (and a lot of the monitoring outsourced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to private companies, and funded by insurance premium reductions)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's eminently economically practical. Add the current Regulation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Investigatory Powers Bill (with its draconian key-disclosure clauses),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public paranoia about porn, paedophilia, poor policing, and privacy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (this is the culture that invented the net curtain, remember) and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a mostly-working prototype of the universal surveilance society.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not surprised that the cradle to grave nanny state is on the forefront of
<BR>
this. I'm also not surprised that the areas in the US that are jumping on the
<BR>
bandwagon also have similarly high levels of taxation, welfare bureaucracy,
<BR>
police forces, and general social misery and oppression.
<BR>
<P>All this incomplete coverage will do is cause more criminals to commit crimes in
<BR>
areas that ARENT under coverage. The crime rate in more rural areas will go up,
<BR>
people will get whacked out on the moors, etc. You'll see a lot of spouses dying
<BR>
in 'accidents' during camping trips. Boating 'accidents' will rise, and
<BR>
criminals will get more circumspect about cleaning up crime scenes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any time you want to check out a total surveilance society in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; embryonic phase, hop on a plane for Heathrow airport. Catch the train
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into London, then get on a double-decker bus. Sit on the top deck, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep your eyes on the buildings -- you need to be looking about ten feet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; above ground level if you want to maximize your camera count. If you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feeling particularly dilligent, map your distance travelled and add an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extra camera for every shop (coverage is over 90% in most shopping areas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now, and some local authorities won't grant planning permission for a new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retail development unless it includes CCTV surveilance).
</EM><BR>
<P>So what you are saying is that Heathrow is a good place to test my Mr. Mike's
<BR>
Big Brother Zapper...oh, that could be fun....
