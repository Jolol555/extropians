<P>despite appropriate caution not to say ridicule expressed at the claim here

<P><EM>&gt;You responded by saying that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Kardeshev civilizations types 1,2, and 3 must evidence themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unquestionably due to the altered features of the cosmos.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that *some* of them surely would, unless they all instantly take
<BR>
themselves down to the nanoscale, hyper-souped up clockspeed and all, and
<BR>
remain sequestered in their own navels.
<BR>
<P>...but...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;from this pre-singularity K.75 vantage, all bets are cancelled by that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;imminent event--The Spike,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;the Kardeshev One Two Three is ambitious and pleasingly impressive, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cannot escape the fact of its rude origins. [...] 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The first guess is never right.  The proof of which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that hard on its heels it is trumped by The Spike.
</EM><BR>
<P>Could well be. I suppose it depends on whether the post-Spike future is
<BR>
*literally unimaginably strange* (perhaps with `magic physics', etc), or
<BR>
just *strictly unpredictable in detail* but functioning within today's
<BR>
rules, more or less (given a better fusion of QT and relativity, say). 
<BR>
<P>I do have a hunch that even more advanced science isn't going to show us
<BR>
that the Earth is actually a gigantic tetrahedron. Will it teach us rules
<BR>
of game theory and economics that *altogether* escape the strictures known
<BR>
to us? Maybe, in which case you're probably right. But if so, the
<BR>
post-Spike ET cultures are likely to be beyond our cognitive event horizon,
<BR>
aren't they? So even if they're *there*, you can't get there from here -
<BR>
*except* via a Spike of your own... Does this disable the Great Filter
<BR>
model? Dunno. Over to Robin... :)
