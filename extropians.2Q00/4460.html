<EM>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, transit at present is a massively government-meddled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with field.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; City government is essentially a monopoly corporation created to keep the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; streets of the city safe, clean, and maintained. If people insist on living in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cities, some sort of a monopoly corporation is considered to be required, though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I imagine that there is the possibility that residents of a street or block
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could form a 'street association' or 'block association' which would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contractual agreements with neighboring associations to share the cost of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintaining the streets they share, though you may wind up with some wildly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; variable streets. Sort of like the 'adopt a highway' program writ large.
</EM><BR>
<P>Where I grew up in Queens county, a borough of New York City, the
<BR>
neighborhood block associations were quite active in taking care of
<BR>
matters that government overlooked.  Various &quot;Business Improvement
<BR>
Districts&quot; throughout the city have sprung up in the last decade to
<BR>
take on sanitation, security and other issues traditionally associated
<BR>
with government but which the city did not deliver to their liking,
<BR>
and they haven't yet shot unarmed civilians to death either. (The
<BR>
Times Square BID is the most famous.)  Central Park has been a lot
<BR>
more pleasant since int eh hands of the Central Park Conservancy, a
<BR>
public-private hybrid trust.
<BR>
<P>Private associations can work to help resolve these issues.  There are
<BR>
a lot of economies of scale available in city living that offer
<BR>
excellent business opportunities in delivering services.  
<BR>
<P>But no matter what, I can assure you that with the city income taxes I
<BR>
paid in the last years I lived there (1997-1998) I more than paid my
<BR>
fair share for services I received.  Boy, did they ever sock it to me.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course, a suburb association ringing a city could essentially lay seige to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the city, blockading supplies to the city, and take control of the government of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that city (just as eight blocks around one block could get together and lay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seige to that block..)
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>I'm a little puzzled by this non sequitur, but what the hell ...  As
<BR>
long as no one in the city could afford to bribe any of the
<BR>
surrounding districts to break the alliance.  Unlikely.  Cities are
<BR>
often concentrations of both wealth and poverty.  There's also the
<BR>
advantage of a large population.  Finally, many large cities have very
<BR>
large waterfronts, and it's no coincidence.  It would be *very* hard
<BR>
to close down the entire NY City waterfront, though the city
<BR>
government, through years of neglect, has done its best to pull off
<BR>
that trick, giving all the business to neighboring cities in New
<BR>
Jersey.
<BR>
