ZERO POWERS SAID: &quot;...I want to live forever as much as the next person, but
<BR>
I can't convince myself that LE is more worthwhile than my own personal rule
<BR>
of thumb:
<BR>
&quot;Everything in moderation.&quot;
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: Zero, that's NOT a recipe for LE; that's just good advice...
<BR>
<P>ZERO SAID: &quot;....as for CR, well I'm too much the Epicurean to want to live
<BR>
forever if it meant thousands of years of wheat germ and carrot juice....&quot;
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: It doesn't work like that...you're stereotyping!
<BR>
<P><P>ZERO SAID: &quot;...But perhaps if the research were compelling enough to show
<BR>
that one or another LE method was sufficiently likely to add a chunk of
<BR>
years onto my life, I'd be interested in looking into it...
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: You need to familiarize your self with the research. It has
<BR>
demonsrated those things. Across the taxonomic spectrum. Now, if you wait
<BR>
for advanced stuff to be demonstated in humans... you have another 50 years
<BR>
coming.  Wait if you wish...
<BR>
<P>ZERO SAID: ...&quot;I know Durk &amp; Sandy of the LEF have been
<BR>
researching/experimenting on themselves for a couple decades now.
<BR>
Anybody know whether they (or any other long term LE'ers) are reaping any
<BR>
benefits?
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: With all due respect, such people might be primarily marketers.
<BR>
Certainly they have been reaping appropriate benefits.
