<P>This quote give one something to think about:
<BR>
<P>\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
<BR>
Chemists who invented new pesticides were astonished when
<BR>
populations of insects developed resistance to them, but the
<BR>
whole point about evolution is that any new method of killing
<BR>
things will, unless it completely wipes out a species, give rise to
<BR>
a population resistant to the killer. One result is that cotton
<BR>
farmers in the very States of the US where resistance to Darwinian
<BR>
ideas is at its strongest are struggling every season with the
<BR>
consequences of evolution at work in their own fields.
<BR>
<P>In hospitals, bacteria that cause diseases are increasingly resist-
<BR>
ant to drugs such as penicillin, for the same reason. The drugs
<BR>
kill all the susceptible bacteria, but, by definition, the survivors
<BR>
of an attack are the ones who are not susceptible to the drug.
<BR>
The more you kill susceptible bacteria, the more opportunities
<BR>
you give the others to spread -- and bacteria breed far more
<BR>
quickly than human beings, offsetting the disadvantage they
<BR>
would otherwise have by not breeding sexually. The surprise, to
<BR>
an evolutionary biologist, is not that after half a century of use
<BR>
penicillin is losing its effectiveness, but rather that it retains any
<BR>
effectiveness at all.&quot;
