<EM>&gt; &gt; Comparisons across poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; countries, regions, and individuals almost never show any substantial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; health effect of variations in medical spending or water and sanitation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think the problem here is that this result is so surprising, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unintuitive, that it is hard for people to believe it, or at least to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fully internalize the belief and build on it.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a reason I am an applied theorist.  Almost all health economics
<BR>
and policy is done by empiricists.  But the results these empiricists
<BR>
communicate to others are dominated by the simple theories they hold.
<BR>
Even when data clearly and repeatedly imply things at odds with their
<BR>
simple theories, they just don't internalize them much, and so don't
<BR>
communicate them well to others.  So when they go make policy
<BR>
recommendations, they are driven by their simple theories, even when
<BR>
those theories are directly at odds with robust data.
<BR>
<P>The basic fact is that we have data robustly and strongly at odds with
<BR>
standard simple theories, and that most health policy advice ignores
<BR>
that data.  As another example, there is basically no adverse selection
<BR>
in insurance when insurance companies are free to price based on what
<BR>
they know.  And yet policy advice is driven by fixing adverse selection.
<BR>
<P>My best health theory attempt so far is: <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;We are accustomed to paradoxical results these days.  You can find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thousands of web pages explaining why simultaneity varies between moving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;observers, or how something can be a particle and a wave at the same time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But where can you find an explanation of why giving people clean water
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and good health care for the first time won't improve their health?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It flies in the face of intuition just as much as those physics phenomena,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and is really far more relevant to our daily lives.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here you run into another problem: people are very reluctant to believe
<BR>
counterintuitive results from the social sciences.  Physicists can say the
<BR>
strangest things, and people will say &quot;isn't that cool&quot;, but if economists
<BR>
say that minimum wages reduce employment, the response is &quot;what do you know.&quot;
