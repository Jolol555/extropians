</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;By my standards, there are some states in the US that are relatively free,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that is being eroded by the continuing federalization of many 'crimes'. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as a whole used to be very free, at least for most people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Most people&quot;?  If you eliminate the poor, all blacks, natives, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-European immigrants (not to mention all children and females, regardless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of race or class) you are left with those for whom the US &quot;used to be very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free&quot; - adult, wealthy, white males.  IMO that hardly constituted &quot;most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Children: They are now regularly prosecuted as adults for crimes at ages as
<BR>
young as 8 years old. They are taxed as adults. They must get registered with
<BR>
social security within a year of birth. They can no longer use firearms, air
<BR>
guns, knives, or other weaponry without close adult supervision (and in some
<BR>
states even that is a crime). They can be expelled from school for innocent
<BR>
behavior like being kissed or pointing a finger at someone.
<BR>
<P>Women: Sure they are free to work, but they must work if they have a family, as
<BR>
nobody can afford a decent living on a single wage anymore due to high taxation.
<BR>
Time was a single wage earner could afford to hire servants, own a large home
<BR>
with a stay at home wife and plenty of kids. How many kids can you afford today?
<BR>
A large percentage of women's income is taxes, so they are enslaved to the
<BR>
government, whereas they used to earn their keep as homemakers tax free, and
<BR>
income taxes were just a few percent for those that did work out of the home.
<BR>
There were no barriers against women working outside of the home, as there were
<BR>
many women doctors, scientists, engineers and other technical workers, as well
<BR>
as many working in other skilled and unskilled professions. Not nearly as many
<BR>
as today, to be sure, but they didn't have to if they didn't want to then. How
<BR>
many women see being a homemaker as their primary profession as a respectable
<BR>
career today? They can't afford to.
<BR>
<P>Poor: Poor people built this country, and many of them got quite rich and
<BR>
comfortable doing it. Some of the richest people started out dirt poor. I would
<BR>
say that at least 90% of the rich people today come from a poor background. All
<BR>
of my ancestors came here dirt poor. The typical socialist hogwash about
<BR>
capitalists exploiting the poor is a load of garbage. The crap you read about in
<BR>
Upton Sinclair's _The Jungle_ turned out to be mostly false, the propaganda of a
<BR>
socialist politician.
<BR>
<P>All of the above once paid little or nothing in taxes, could carry a gun
<BR>
anywhere they damn pleased, were not vilified by political pressure groups, and
<BR>
could speak their mind without worry about being prosecuted for it.
<BR>
<P>What I was referring to WAS blacks, native americans, etc. minorities who have
<BR>
been obviously discriminated against.
