<P>
[OK . . . I am officially not using my time efficiently this weekend . . . 
<BR>
but I think this is a damned important subject.  (There are other damned 
<BR>
important subjects going on on the list right now, but compared to resolving 
<BR>
global hunger, ignorance and poverty, they look insoluble :-0) ]
<BR>
<P>Seriously, when I suggested adopting something like Greenstar as a &quot;pet 
<BR>
charity&quot;, I wasn't suggesting it as an &quot;only charity&quot;.  Consider how many 
<BR>
units they could manufacture and create if a significant portion of people in 
<BR>
sci-tech jobs in the developed world donated $5 or $10.  Enough to set a 
<BR>
significant example, perhaps, and show that technology CAN make a difference. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Maybe 1,000 units?  That could make a big difference in a lot of people's 
<BR>
lives within the next few years, and more importantly, could serve as a seed 
<BR>
around which more such efforts could be organized.
<BR>
<P>I don't doubt that the installations would be at risk of being suborned by 
<BR>
local thugs.  You'd have to pick your projects wisely.  You wouldn't want to 
<BR>
put them into the middle of a war zone.  But you could work around the edges, 
<BR>
creating islands of prosperity from which you could grow the movement.
<BR>
<P>And I agree that we need to put money into explicitly transhumanist work.  
<BR>
Hey - we don't get nearly as many payments of membership dues and other 
<BR>
contributions to ExI and Foresight as we should, given the growing interest 
<BR>
in the subjects these organizations address.  My point is that something like 
<BR>
Greenstar may well be a better and smarter use of a different kind of 
<BR>
charitable donation than, say &quot;Save the Children&quot; or the like.
<BR>
<P>Finally, let me say that I didn't do anything like a complete listing of 
<BR>
reasons why supporting a project like Greenstar (or Grameen Bank) is a good 
<BR>
idea.  At one very selfish level, my happiness is increased by reducing the 
<BR>
widespread levels of hunger, ignorance, poverty, tyranny and hopelessness in 
<BR>
the world.  The existence of these things makes me feel bad, and doing 
<BR>
something to combat them makes me feel better.  Furthermore, I think doing 
<BR>
things like Greenstar and Grameen is a better expenditure for &quot;defense&quot; than 
<BR>
much of what we spend on our military establishments in the First World.  
<BR>
There are many other good reasons, but I wanted to add these two to the one I 
<BR>
cited previously.
