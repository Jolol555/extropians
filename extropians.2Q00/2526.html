10:39 AM,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I never a) threatened anyones privacy (though Zero, by his opinions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threatens mine)
</EM><BR>
<P>You repeatedly are insisting that Zero should publish his home address, when
<BR>
he has made it clear that he does not want to do so.  You have insulted him,
<BR>
called him a coward, and repeatedly tried to convince him to reveal his
<BR>
address.  You have even stated that you expect to find some horrible secret
<BR>
in his past once he reveals his name and address to you.  This is what I
<BR>
mean by threaten his privacy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; b) I am attacking not Zero personally, but his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demonstrated hypocrisy. There is a difference.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe, but both are a far cry from discussing topics.  You are discussing
<BR>
Zero and/or his behavior.
<BR>
<P>c) You've never done the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; same thing when Zero treated me in the same way in other debates, so you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are practicing a double standard. Because the idea in question is such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal matter the point is that the mere idea of his attacks me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personally, as much as the opinions of any german fascist threaten a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jew.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't follow you, but please quote the exact postings you mean.  I promise
<BR>
to forward them with an official request for review to have the list owners
<BR>
and list moderators.  We can then see if they agree with your claim of being
<BR>
personally attacked by Zero.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
