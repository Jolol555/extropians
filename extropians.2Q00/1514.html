He still is not allowed to use a computer, even since his release. He also
<BR>
was invited to many computer security conference to speak. One was held on
<BR>
NASA property, NASA discovered this, and would not allow him on their
<BR>
property. (even though it is not illegal to have been convicted and to step
<BR>
on gov. property)

<P><P><EM>&gt; Mike Lorrey replies:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No, he didn't. Moreover, he was in jail for something like 3 years
</EM><BR>
before he was
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; even arraigned. They wouldn't let him have access to evidence, or
</EM><BR>
participate in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; his defense, and he was refused access to simple electronic devices like
</EM><BR>
phones
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and calculators.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/mitnick.background/">http://cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/mitnick.background/</A> puts a little different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spin on this:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Mitnick's trial had been delayed several times due its complexity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    and often at the request of the defense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the defense is requesting delays, that is not consistent with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demanding a speedy trial.  The defense doesn't get to drive the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process, setting the timetable which all parties must follow, for their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own convenience.  They can demand a speedy trial and then both sides are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handicapped by the rapidity of the proceedings.  But once the defense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starts requesting delays, the prosecution gets to do so as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Randolph tried repeatedly to get Mitnick a computer so he could review
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    evidence that reportedly includes witness statements totaling 1,400
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    pages, 10 gigabytes of electronic evidence and 1,700 exhibits in all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    But after one hearing, Randolph told reporters that Judge Pfaelzer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    &quot;didn't seem to want to hear 'computer' and 'Mitnick' in the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    sentence.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The court ultimately allowed Mitnick access to a laptop, but it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    in a room for attorney-client meetings, and he was always monitored by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    someone from Randolph's office. And there was no modem or phone line.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So it wasn't that he was denied access to evidence, he was denied access
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to computers.  From what I read here it implies that if his lawyer had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply printed out the relevant data on paper and carried it in, Mitnick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could do whatever he wanted with it.  But the lawyer wasn't allowed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bring in a computer until late in the proceedings.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    In the meanwhile, Mitnick has been serving out a 14-month sentence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for violating his probation in the Digital break-in and eight months
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for a 1995 North Carolina charge of possession of an unauthorized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    access device.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    &quot;Kevin's problem is that he has been convicted multiple times,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    said journalist Markoff. &quot;Whatever you think of his crime, he has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    tripped the relevant federal guidelines. And the judge gave him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    a break before. Now he's before her again for another series of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    federal crimes.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He was denied bail, but he was a known flight risk.  He had been a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fugitive for three years until Shimomura caught him, and law enforcement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couldn't count on the assistance of a top rank computer security expert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to catch Mitnick next time.  So I can fully understand the denial of bail.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Plus it sounds like two years of his jail time was counted as working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off previous sentences.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Putting all this together, Mitnick has had a rough ride, but he has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brought it on himself.  He violated his probation and he fled from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; justice despite lenient treatment by the judges in his earlier arrests.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Under those conditions no one could not expect kind treatment from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criminal justice system.  At least some of his jail time was owed due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to previous convictions, and he himself requested delays in his trial.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The judges may have been excessively paranoid in keeping Mitnick away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from phones and computers, but these are not technological people and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it was hard for them to know what harm Mitnick might accomplish with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access to this equipment.  And these limitations do not prevent Mitnick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from participating in his defense.  For hundreds of years prisoners have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gotten by without computers.
</EM><BR>
