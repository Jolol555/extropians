<EM>&gt; &gt; Who owns the roads???  Whoever provides the roads sets the policy re
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; insurance - or can if they choose, and they probably will, as otherwise 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; might either find themselves stuck in ligigation or without customers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There are a number of different roles in this case, the drivers, the road
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;owners, the car owners, and the insurers of the drivers, roads and cars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Each insurer sets its own policy, of course. But I think KPJ was asking 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;happens in case where there are incompatible policies. One extreme example
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be if a driver who has no insurance at all is responsible for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;substantial amount of damage (way above what he can compensate for).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;/felix
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
How did he get on the road?  We certainly have the technology to detect, bar 
<BR>
and/or apprehend people who trespass on private property, such as the roads 
<BR>
in this example.  So, his insurance policy and its coverage, including 
<BR>
methods of resolving disputes would have to be compatible with that of the 
<BR>
road owners.  Knowledge that the trespasser would be responsible for costs 
<BR>
incurred in collaring or identifying and billing - whichever is deemed more 
<BR>
cost effective in the particular case - would be deterrent enough in most - 
<BR>
but not all - cases.
<BR>
<P>In a strictly civil legal system, which is what I as a free-market anarchist 
<BR>
am aiming for, you put up with a certain amount of &quot;scoff-law&quot; behavior, on 
<BR>
the theory that it's better to deal with it calmly and cost-effectively than 
<BR>
make a war.  You know that in an emergency you're not going to pay much 
<BR>
attention to details of property boundaries, for example.
<BR>
<P>If your lover is dying and you're rushing to the hospital, you're not likely 
<BR>
to stop and pay the toll, and a society that demanded that you do is both 
<BR>
silly and vicious.  But the toll guy or the computer records the incident 
<BR>
and you get a bill.  You can contest the bill under the hypothetical uniform 
<BR>
social contract which I see as a key foundation to such as society, but 
<BR>
regardless, the only option other than paying your expenses is to become an 
<BR>
outlaw or segregate yourself into one of the ghettos where congenitally 
<BR>
irresponsible or vicious people can afford to live.  Either way, you're not 
<BR>
likely to be allowed to drive on most roads until you do clear your credit 
<BR>
record - and get insurance, or a large bond.
<BR>
<P>As for people who commit destructive acts, such as murder or killing someone 
<BR>
while driving drunk, for which restitution is out of their possible range, 
<BR>
or full restitution may be impossible, you can either let the system take 
<BR>
its course and let the insurance and collection agencies try to work out the 
<BR>
best possible deal for the surviving victims - family, friends, creditors, 
<BR>
etc., or, if you really think it's worth it and you want to make an example, 
<BR>
or you just can't live with the knowledge that that person is alive, while 
<BR>
your loved one isn't, you can do what you can do today - shoot the person 
<BR>
yourself.
<BR>
<P>In the society I've suggested, you would then find yourself in the position 
<BR>
of the original killer - in fact, you would now be responsible for the debts 
<BR>
he or she incurred to his other victims - but you could probably offset at 
<BR>
least some of your liability with what he or she already owed you as a 
<BR>
victim.  If it was a jointly agreed upon act by a group of victims, i.e., 
<BR>
the family of the deceased - to terminate the person who was the cause of 
<BR>
their problem - then they might not end up owing too much at all.  I think 
<BR>
that this kind of extreme scenario would be rather rare, but I do like to 
<BR>
look at the extreme ends of a spectrum, where bad theory breaks down, but 
<BR>
good theory shines.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From a systems standpoint, you can see that in all likelihood, the kind of 
</EM><BR>
ongoing vendetta that is all too common in many societies would be 
<BR>
self-dampening in this kind of system, as the more people who were drawn in, 
<BR>
the more expensive it would get for the perpetrators, as there would be 
<BR>
increasing multitudes of side victims and claims.  Better in general to let 
<BR>
it go, collect what damages you can - except in the cases of mad dog 
<BR>
psychopaths.
<BR>
<P>In the case of real predators, once it's established that they're going to 
<BR>
keep piling up victims, then eventually they will find themselves with 
<BR>
literally nowhere to stand, as no one wants them around, and they have no 
<BR>
more resources to pay anyone, and then they will likely attempt something 
<BR>
violent against someone able to defend themselves, or their victims will 
<BR>
decide enough is enough, the guy can't possibly pay restitution anyway, so 
<BR>
there's no great liability in terminating him.
