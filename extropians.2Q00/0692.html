Concluding paragraphs from &quot;Mitotic Misregulation and Human Ageing&quot; Science,
<BR>
31 MAR 2000
<BR>
<P>This is the article widely reported recently about errors in gene expression
<BR>
as we age done right here in San Diego at the Scripps Research Institute.
<BR>
Looks like they've identified about 61 genes (out of 6000 that were looked
<BR>
at)that change significantly from youth to middle age to old age.  
<BR>
<P>Next step: explaining WHY they change.  Comments?
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We suggest that an altered expression of genes involved in cell
<BR>
division occurs with age. These changes result in increased rates of somatic
<BR>
mutation, leading to numerical and structural chromosome aberrations and
<BR>
mutations that manifest themselves as an aging phenotype. Previous studies
<BR>
have demonstrated an increase in aneuploidy with increased age (45), and
<BR>
down-regulation of mitotic genes has been shown to lead to aneuploidy in
<BR>
experimental models. For example, both a motorless mitotic
<BR>
centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK) and antisense inhibition of MCAK lead
<BR>
to chromosome lagging during antiphase (13). It has also been argued that
<BR>
mutations in presenilin 1 and 2, which are associated with both the
<BR>
interphase kinetochore and centrosome and account for most early onset
<BR>
familial Alzheimer's disease, may result in chromosome pathologies (46).
<BR>
Aneuploidy associated with chromosome 21 is involved in Down syndrome, a
<BR>
disease characterized by some features of premature aging. Misregulation of
<BR>
genes involved in cell division may be the result of an intrinsic lack of
<BR>
fidelity that arises in the absence of selection in the postreproductive
<BR>
stage. Alternatively, the growing loss of fidelity may result from the
<BR>
cumulative effects of oxidative damage associated with metabolism, which are
<BR>
slowed by caloric restriction (24). In fact, there may be multiple entry
<BR>
points into this process. For example, Werner syndrome, which is
<BR>
characterized by the premature appearance of aging in young adults (47),
<BR>
shows an increased rate of chromosomal abnormalities caused by mutations in
<BR>
a DNA helicase or exonuclease enzyme known as WRN.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chromosome pathologies that begin to occur in dividing cells
<BR>
relatively early in life (postreproductive stage) may then lead to
<BR>
misregulation of key structural, signaling, and metabolic genes associated
<BR>
with the aging phenotype, such as osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease,
<BR>
arthritis, and so forth. Misregulation of this sort is expected to increase
<BR>
in each round of cell division. It may be propagated to other normal mitotic
<BR>
(e.g., leukocytes, epithelial cells, glial cells, and so forth) and post
<BR>
mitotic (e.g., neurons, muscles, and so forth) cells through changes in the
<BR>
ECM and oxidized fatty acid derivatives that affect signaling pathways.
<BR>
Aging, therefore, may occur gradually and in mosaic patterns, rather than as
<BR>
a uniform phenomenon as in cancerous growth, which is clonal. Additional
<BR>
studies are required before we can understand the aging process in complex
<BR>
organisms, both in mitotic and postmitotic tissue, but the studies reported
<BR>
here highlight important mechanisms that may contribute to aging and
<BR>
age-related problems.&quot;
