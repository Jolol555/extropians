In response to Mr. Greg Burch,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in which cross-section of society you wish to target 
<BR>
with your campaign.  Are you interested in including the whole population, or 
<BR>
just the few who are willing to strive for these wonderful advances in health 
<BR>
and longevity? You wrote the following:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Although this cultural barrier has probably not yet thrown up any real 
<BR>
impediment to progress toward advances in human longevity or other kinds of 
<BR>
augmentation, the time will come fairly soon when it will.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to research conducted by the authors of the book, The Bell 
<BR>
Curve, people from every race, creed, sex and religion that fall wihin the 
<BR>
top 5% of the IQ curve have been quietly congregating.  During the past One 
<BR>
Hundred years, certain neighborhoods, schools, professions, and companies 
<BR>
have naturally attracted this cognative elite(cognative elite is the term 
<BR>
used in THE BELL CURVE for those scoring in the top 5% on IQ tests) in the 
<BR>
natural march towards evolution.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully reading several hundred responses to the Extropian 
<BR>
mailing list, it is my estimation that both the Transhuman and Extropian 
<BR>
groups are examples of the hypothesis The Bell Curve presents.  In other 
<BR>
words most people on this list would fit THE BELL CURVE'S definition of the 
<BR>
cognitive elite.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is this: If the majority of the population has been unaware of 
<BR>
a social trend that has been occuring for at least One Hundred years, and you 
<BR>
feel they will cause unnecessary and uninformed impediments for your 
<BR>
suggested movement, why waste time bringing their attention to such a 
<BR>
project? If so many are asleep at the wheel of life, why try to encourage 
<BR>
them to support the &quot;Advances in human longevity&quot;? This suggestion may sound 
<BR>
terriably elitist, and I do not intend it to be so, but this type of 
<BR>
innovative thinking has historically been quelled from many secters.  Maybe 
<BR>
it is time for those who wish to acquire health and longevity to do just 
<BR>
that? Let the people who are satisfied with the &quot;natural human life-span&quot; 
<BR>
continue to live with their comfortable thinking.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to bring these advances to light in Magazines, books 
<BR>
and other such material for those seeking it, but those that seek out this 
<BR>
form of information gathering would beless likely to cause as much strife as 
<BR>
those who would &quot;Just happen to hear a news blurb&quot; about the suggested topic.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for any response to this inquiry,
<BR>
Ron Harrison
