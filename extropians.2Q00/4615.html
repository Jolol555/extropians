<P><EM>&gt;The John/Joan case catapulted Dr. Money to fame... and it was bad science
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the start.  He started with a preconceived idea and altered his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experimental data to support it. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, one of the truly astonishing aspects of Colapinto's book is that
<BR>
it revealed, apparently for the first time in this long debate, that
<BR>
Money's own unpublished PhD thesis provided survey evidence that
<BR>
non-`corrected' individuals *didn't* suffer unduly during maturation, and
<BR>
certainly didn't go mad. This was only a few years before he changed his
<BR>
tune. So his basic preconceptions were the *other way around*. Really weird.
<BR>
<P>His cover-up of David's key case is shocking and disgraceful, of course. I
<BR>
find it piquant that this sort of thing happens on all sides of such
<BR>
questions. Last time round, it was Cyril Burt concocting IQ to prove the
<BR>
superior impact of heritability over nurture. La la.
<BR>
<P>Colapinto's book demonizes Money to an extraordinary extent, not allowing
<BR>
him the benefit of a good conscience (however misguided, and admittedly
<BR>
that PhD makes it hard to be generous). He is subtly and repeatedly held up
<BR>
to ridicule and revulsion for his uncensored speech (he said `fuck' and
<BR>
`shit' even in front of children... oh no), his own bisexual activities,
<BR>
the way he showed his child patients `pornography', that is, pictures of
<BR>
naked adults and children, some of them fucking. There's a strong
<BR>
implication, as I read it, that we're meant to suspect him of paedophilia
<BR>
as well as his other crimes. This is very strange stuff from a reporter who
<BR>
published his original story on the case in... Rolling Stone (not Reader's
<BR>
Digest).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You could have something in  your theory about castrati... but I haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even been curious about those individuals. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I mentioned them only as a kind of comparison test case. But an interesting
<BR>
one, I think.
<BR>
<P>Do you assume that your own brain was feminized in utero, even though your
<BR>
body (evidently) wasn't?
<BR>
<P>Do you think that those people who choose to switch later in life (several
<BR>
of my gfs and old pals are now elective lesbians, after years of
<BR>
heterosexuality) must always have been pre-wired to make the move? This
<BR>
seems to me perhaps as dangerous a preconception as the purely socially
<BR>
constructed variety. I *do* think we, or some of us, have the ability to
<BR>
expand or specialise our sexual desires, up to a point. (I personally can't
<BR>
find it imaginable to feel gay desire, which narrows my chances dismally.
<BR>
But marooned on Mars with the other guys in an all-male crew, maybe I'd
<BR>
eventually get more sentimental about my buds...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Did I cover/respond to the points you were interested in Damien?
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for the comments, Lorree.
