<P>&lt;&lt; My view is that the better one is preserved, the sooner they
<BR>
&nbsp;will be fully recovered.  There really can be no hard this one made it
<BR>
&nbsp;and that one didn't.  Tippler, Moravec, and others have theorized
<BR>
&nbsp;about various ways our children will eventually be able to perfectly
<BR>
&nbsp;restore all of us.  &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Hear Hear!
<BR>
<P>&lt;Until we
<BR>
&lt;can completely restore him too, we must forever morn, strive, and&gt;
<BR>
&lt;never give up hope right?  Why would anyone want to live and strive&gt;
<BR>
&lt;for something for a billion years anyway, unless it was to finally get&gt;
<BR>
&lt;the chance to achieve the ability to meet and be with Sasha, and all&gt;
<BR>
&lt;of our parents, so we can thank them and pay them back for what&gt;
<BR>
&lt;they've done and for being our literal creators having given us&gt;
<BR>
&lt;everything we started with right?&gt;
<BR>
<P>We need more theorists on this list willing to do the speculative science 
<BR>
papers for this subject and see if anything can ever be done.  Cryogenics is 
<BR>
a fabulous idea, but it puts me ( a little) in mind of those Americans who 
<BR>
spent oodles of cash building fallout shelters. The fallout shelters may have 
<BR>
preserved them a couple of weeks; but the ecosystem would have taken a couple 
<BR>
of centuries to revive to enough health to sustain rational-technical 
<BR>
civilization! By then, of course, humanity would have nearly died off. We'd 
<BR>
be back to hunter-gathers using rusting rifles that we might never repair.
<BR>
<P>All that notwithstanding, we all grieve in different ways; and it will take 
<BR>
time for many to recover their ' vision' for the movement. Sasha's passing 
<BR>
suggests that even with cryogenics, most of humanity alive today and all of 
<BR>
our ancestors have &quot;worked without a net.&quot; For those of us who Don't  make it 
<BR>
to the Nitrogen Slumber room; we need such a net.
