<P>
I don't have any particular problems with Freitas's title.  Aside from
<BR>
that, Hal Finney is right about everything, particularly including this:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is not an early or intermediate level of nanotech development.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It would be among the most sophisticated nanotech applications imaginable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By the time such a global system could be designed, developed and put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into play, gray goo could have wiped out the world ten times over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There seems to be a fundamental mismatch between the sophistication of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the goodbots, who run an active immune system that checks every cell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the planet, and the badbots, who can't manage to operate even as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efficiently as green plants.
</EM><BR>
<P>And this:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It also should be much more objective about the seriousness of the gray
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goo threat.  Foresight seems to have made a political decision to downplay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gray goo in the last several years, and this paper unfortunately seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be consistent with that political position.  Much more work needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be done before we have a clear picture of the true scope of the gray
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goo threat.  Robert Freitas has made an important contribution, but we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are not yet in position to settle the matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>I also have some comments remaining that haven't been entirely obsoleted
<BR>
by Hal's remarks:
<BR>
<P>(1)  Nanoweaponry fighting it out on the nanoscale arrives relatively
<BR>
late in the game; in real life, the first two &quot;nanoweapons&quot; to have a
<BR>
military impact would be diamondoid jet fighters and the like, followed
<BR>
by saturation launches of vat-grown nuclear weapons.  We'd have to get
<BR>
through that without blowing ourselves up before we'd get the chance to
<BR>
dust the biosphere.  Even if Freitas's paper is entirely true in every
<BR>
detail, it doesn't mean - as a policy conclusion - that there's a safe
<BR>
path to nanotechnology.
<BR>
<P>(2)  The battle strategies depicted here aren't twisted enough to depict
<BR>
a real-life arms race.  Would military replibots really wait around
<BR>
passively to be swept up into neat little nets?  If sentrybots in the
<BR>
human body can detect replibots, can't the replibots detect the
<BR>
sentrybots and hide?  In some ways, the straightforward analysis of
<BR>
nanowarfare is like mathematically analyzing a computer's transistors
<BR>
and then concluding that, since it can reject incorrect passwords with a
<BR>
success rate of 99.9999999%, the Internet is secure.  Thanks to human
<BR>
cunning and human error, we can't even protect our own computers with
<BR>
any sort of certainty, even though we control the virtual &quot;laws of
<BR>
physics&quot; and can scan or alter every byte of RAM; are we really supposed
<BR>
to win a cracker's war in physical reality?
<BR>
<P>(3)  Assuming that a single radiation strike produces device failure is
<BR>
conservative when arguing a proof-of-possibility that nanomachines can
<BR>
be constructed.  It is extremely non-conservative when trying to set an
<BR>
upper limit on the reproduction rate of aerovores.  Given that we will
<BR>
need to master the art of robust design at all levels of the system
<BR>
architecture simply to allow tolerance and debugging of human errors in
<BR>
nanotechnological designs - never mind radiation errors - I would be
<BR>
inclined to run the numbers for N-cleave = 1000, 10000, or perhaps even
<BR>
higher.  (Has anyone tried running simulations of the effect of
<BR>
radiation errors on atomically detailed designs, e.g. the Parts list at IMM?)
<BR>
<P>(4)  &quot;...an immediate international moratorium...&quot; (from 9.0)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why call attention to ourselves now, risking a media brouhaha and a
<BR>
ban on all nanotechnology?  By the time global ecophagy is a real
<BR>
threat, everyone will have been screaming about diamondoid fighter jets
<BR>
for the last year, and there'll be moratoriums all over the place.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A non-governmental-organization (i.e. Foresight) publishing
<BR>
voluntary guidelines is good enough for the immediate memetic effect,
<BR>
too; you just say, in a heavy, serious tone of voice:  &quot;The Foresight
<BR>
Guidelines explicitly prohibit the development of replicators which can
<BR>
operate in a biological environment; furthermore, the Foresight
<BR>
Guidelines require that even vat replicators use a broadcast
<BR>
architecture...&quot; and so on.
