<EM>&gt; &gt; Uh-huh. Then the EU anti-trust investigation into Microsoft must be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; imaginary, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft's european operations can probably be investigated, but the EU has no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extraterritorial authority, esp re a US corp. They can certainly regulate MS's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business practices in europe if they so choose, but they certainly cannot impose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any remedies upon MS corporation proper.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes it can. If Microsoft wants to trade in Europe it must abide by EU
<BR>
laws. Don't want to obey the law? Take the penalty, or get out. Microsoft
<BR>
has lots of employees based in Europe, and they're sure as hell vulnerable
<BR>
to this sort of thing.
<BR>
<P>Microsoft _can_ side-step an EU anti-trust investigation -- all they have
<BR>
to do is stop selling Windows anywhere in the EU, at which point they
<BR>
aren't a monopoly any more. If they _want_ to sell Windows in that
<BR>
environment ...
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (Oh, and then there's the French investigation. _That_ one is dynamite --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the charges are extremely serious and typically carry prison sentences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for the directors of companies found guilty under them, because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; French charges aren't about anti-trust -- they're anti-FRAUD, and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; allege that Microsoft defrauded the French government. Oops ...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extra-territoriality again. They gonna send the Foreign Legion into the US to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrest Bill Gates?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Quite possibly, knowing the French ... but remember, Microsoft is behaving
<BR>
extra-territorially. In the event, I expect they'll just lock up the
<BR>
directors of Microsoft's French subsidiary, and/or fine the company, and
<BR>
maybe put out an extradition warrant for Bill.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Microsoft occupies a similar monopoly position in the rest of the world,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if not a tighter one -- and typically charges more for its software.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hardly. China, for example, the communist party bosses who have been pirating so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much MS software control a greater monopoly position in the chinese software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market than MS does. Just because the market uses MS software that is pirated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't mean you can say MS monopolizes the market.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Rest of world != China. Plus, they hardly have a monopoly on it -- they
<BR>
merely steal the most of it.
