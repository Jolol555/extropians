<P>
<EM>&gt; Bull. a) resources are only as limited as the inefficiencies of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socialist governments make them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Last I heard, resources were limited.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; b) current production efficiency and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capacity here in the US are such that every person could live quite a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nice life. As it is, only about a third of the population or so actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; works.
</EM><BR>
<P>And yet many live in (abject) poverty; this supports your position?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; c) food production, with spoilage, would provide a 3500 calorie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diet to every person on earth if the socialist governments got out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the way and let their people acheive.
</EM><BR>
<P>We are talking about the planet Earth, yes? The food's already available;
<BR>
it's just that some people have it (more than they need), and some don't.
<BR>
<P>There should be made a further distinction here between forms of socialism.
<BR>
World System theory makes a rough (maybe quite distinct) division between
<BR>
countries in what it calls the Capitalist World System. The two types are
<BR>
Core and Peripheral countries (there are also in-between countries termed
<BR>
the Semi-periphery, but that's not so important here).
<BR>
<P>The Core countries are the wealthy capitalist countries, where industry is,
<BR>
where the wealth is. The Peripheral countries are the poor countries (the
<BR>
third world), where industry and wealth is not. There is a history of
<BR>
centuries of the core countries of the world dragging natural resources out
<BR>
of the periphery, and using them internally; wealth moves out of the
<BR>
periphery and into the core.
<BR>
<P>The distinction between forms of socialism then is between core country
<BR>
socialism (really semi-periphery, since socialist countries are not part of
<BR>
the capitalist core) and socialism in the periphery - basically, between
<BR>
eastern-european socialism and third world socialism (I'm not sure where
<BR>
China fits in here).
<BR>
<P>Many third world countries may call themselves socialist, but are just your
<BR>
common or garden tyrranies when you get down to it. Similarly there is an
<BR>
idea of substantive and formal democracy; throughout the third world you
<BR>
find countries which call themselves democratic (and capitalist), but are
<BR>
nothing more than military dictatorships. I would suggest calling both forms
<BR>
of political/economic system simply dictatorships, because that's how they
<BR>
work.
<BR>
<P>So back to the point above... when you talk about socialist governments
<BR>
&quot;getting in the way&quot;, there is a large class of countries, mostly poor, that
<BR>
call themselves socialist but are nothing of the sort; they should be
<BR>
treated seperately in any argument re the above.
<BR>
<P>However, there is much to discuss regarding third world, or peripheral,
<BR>
countries, and their utter exploitation by multinationals and foreign
<BR>
governments wielding massive amounts of foreign capital (&amp; foreign debt). It
<BR>
is the modern colonialism. It involves the core stripping the wealth from
<BR>
the periphery, it renders their economies massively impoverished in the long
<BR>
term, and it means that &quot;if the socialist governments got out of the way and
<BR>
let their people acheive&quot;, the result would be sweet f*ck all.
<BR>
<P>Note that peripheral countries cannot opt out of this lock, or fight their
<BR>
way out; when they try to opt out, they usually go socialist (capitalism
<BR>
we'rnt treetin em so gud) and are reviled and economically sanctioned by the
<BR>
core, sometimes attacked; when they try to fight their way out, they are
<BR>
squashed like puny bugs by certain &quot;world police&quot; that shall remain nameless
<BR>
here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; NOTE: starvation only happens in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socialist and econimically authoritarian countries.
</EM><BR>
<P>hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo the pain hoo hoo hoo hoo oh I forgot, america has
<BR>
dumpsters where you can put the spoiling food from the supermarkets
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Demanding that a small minority do all the productive work, confiscating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; half their production as 'taxes', so a majority can live in sloth is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what is really greedy and inconsiderate. Its modern slavery.
</EM><BR>
<P>So quit your job and bludge. Go on. Better to die on your feet than to live
<BR>
on your knees, and all that stuff.
<BR>
