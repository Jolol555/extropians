<EM>&gt; &gt; Volume production is at odds with picking a few good projects.  To support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  volume production, you'd need an easy way to find lots of good sites.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  I am highly skeptical of the economics of this enterprise.  It seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  driven by self-indulgence of rich engineers.  Comparisons across poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  countries, regions, and individuals almost never show any substantial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  health effect of variations in medical spending or water and sanitation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  And the idea that random isolated villages could recoup $100K investments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  via ecommerce seems just ludicrous, even if the equipment isn't just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stolen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, I think the e-commerce cost-recoupment idea is also impractical.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems like &quot;window dressing&quot; for the core idea of making a modular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power/water/net/clinic unit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As for the job of picking good sites, there's probably no shortcut around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that.  However, there are lots of do-gooder First Worlders who volunteer to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work on things like this.  My enthusiasm for the idea of making a robust,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simple, modular &quot;infrastructure&quot; module for use in the Third World is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; undimmed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, its a good idea, no doubt about it. If they got the cost down below $25k it
<BR>
would probably be quite cost effective. I think the importance of the
<BR>
ecommerce/media server capabilities do more for not only building community and
<BR>
cultural identity, but it gives such communities a voice and identity in the
<BR>
world. When some tyrant decides to oppress such people, they won't just be some
<BR>
hard to pronounce village, they will have music that anyone in the world can
<BR>
hear, and pictures of their everyday life for people to empathize with.
<BR>
As for protecting such an asset against theft or destruction, I imagine that
<BR>
adobe walls can be built around the container, which will give the structure not
<BR>
only greater thermal protection, but the villagers can fold up the solar panels
<BR>
and stow them away and slap a straw roof on to make it look like a normal
<BR>
building before the troops move in.
<BR>
For the ecommerce server to be cost effective, its of course important that the
<BR>
village have something worth selling on the world market.
