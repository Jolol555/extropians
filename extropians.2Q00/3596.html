<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since when exactly was the level of taxation directly inversely

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proportional to how 'free' a country is? Unless one is arguing for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; system of no taxation and public services at all, the specifics seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat irrelevant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The specifics are entirely relevant.  First, the amount of taxation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; essentially determines how much of your labor is slave labor (adjusted for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; rate of return, but that typically is pretty damn low).  Second, taxation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that is tied more closely to service usage is more fair than taxation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; based on other arbitrary metrics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; [snip long, but very good example of (non)efficient tax usage]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I was ambiguous. What I think I meant is that the specifics in terms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the percentile figures for taxation are not much use with no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consideration of how that money is being used (which can be well or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; badly, as you say).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Once you've decided to allow for some taxation, however (as opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; none at all, as Mike has suggested - and it is a vaild option) it makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; very little sense to try and compare exactly how much freedom a country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has removed, via its taxes. There are simply far too many factors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, the fact is that Charlie is enslaved 40% of the time, while I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enslaved less than 16% of the time. Which of us is more free?
</EM><BR>
<P>But if you look at both formal and effective freedoms, you may work out
<BR>
to be more free than before, overall.
<BR>
<P>Formally, I have the right to go into a computer shop and buy myself a
<BR>
nice shiny new laptop. Effectively, I can't, because I can't afford it.
<BR>
<P>Formally, I have the right to a good education, but in a tax-free,
<BR>
service-free system, I may not have the effective freedom to have it.
<BR>
But by removing some of one of my freedoms (the right to choose how I
<BR>
spend my money), one of my other rights is protected.
<BR>
<P>Things aren't as simple as more tax == less freedom. By careful
<BR>
adjustment - removing some to ensure, or add, others - one can end up
<BR>
with greatly varying amounts of freedom.
<BR>
<P>It's still a very solid point that a system of no taxation at all is
<BR>
pretty damn free. But if you're going to allow for even a bit of tax to
<BR>
maintain basic public services (such as a minimal police force - the
<BR>
night watchman state), you have to take into consideration that by
<BR>
difference balancing, varying levels of taxation could result in more or
<BR>
less freedom, depending on how the money is used.
<BR>
<P>So as long as the US and UK both maintain *some* level of taxation, it's
<BR>
not particularly useful to try and compare their freedoms based only on
<BR>
the tax rate.
<BR>
<P>Although I'm very happy to discuss the specifics of the freedoms gained
<BR>
and lost in both systems.
