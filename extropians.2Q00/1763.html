<P>It sure would. And so long as enough people and businesses forsee, anticipate,
<BR>
and plan for changes into such an economy, there shouldn't be that much
<BR>
instability. However if large changes occur that most people don't anticipate
<BR>
and plan for, then there will be an interregnum period of instability and
<BR>
dislocation as everything takes time to sort out the new order.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But in the reality, we have ever faster growth, in 3 months
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (10 years on flimdoodle industry time scale), we have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HyperFlimDoodles (HFDs) introduced, and the popolation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psyched about continuing innovations, is motivated to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work and consume more than ever before, to the extent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they have less time than ever left for dancing, poetry,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sex, and contemplation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - And that's exactly what has been going on for awhile now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it has. And we've known since 1968 that the previous generation of
<BR>
technology for the computer industry is replaced every 18 months for the same
<BR>
price, and the price of the old generation is then worth half as much. Industry
<BR>
now knows this and uses it as a standard model for planning new products require
<BR>
x amount of processing that needs to be sold for x dollars. As computers have
<BR>
become a larger and larger part of our economy, that 18 month effect takes on a
<BR>
bigger and bigger role in moderating longer term economic cycles.
<BR>
<P>I think a good question to ask is: when the dominant technology is replaced by
<BR>
significantly more advanced generations in cycles shorter than the typical
<BR>
economic cycle, and every new generation is anticipated and planned for, and
<BR>
does not cause a need for significant retraining of personnell, what effect does
<BR>
this have on the economy in general?
<BR>
<P>I would propose that just as the singularity of intelligence is seen to begin
<BR>
when desktop computer technology exceeds the capacity of the human mind, the
<BR>
economic singularity should be seen to have begun when the world's economic
<BR>
cycle is dominated by this 18 month cycle as well, rather than the older
<BR>
business cycle model...
