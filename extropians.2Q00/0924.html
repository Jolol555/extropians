<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Would not most humans, both those living in, and those visiting the

<EM>&gt; &gt;United
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  States, wish to see the information, preferably in the form of a map,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  more detailed the better, so they who prefer to avoid death and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;mutilation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  can avoid the dangerous places where, apparently, the Bad Guys, Inc.,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  humans with impunity?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  Has anybody produced such a map already?  If not, why not?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  It seems there would exist a large market for such detailed maps.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Based on personal experience...yes..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Get any map of the US....east of the Mississippi..is bad...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;North of the mason dixon line is especially bad.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Primarily metro areas...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;However there are exceptions...like Southern Calif.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I think there is a large corelation to political affiliation.....(which one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is left as an exercise to the student)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This map, however, would not include many of those places which have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; featured in the news of late for kids shooting other kids in school.  One
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be hard pressed to describe such a map accurately, other than to say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;stay out of any areas where there are sickos who have access to guns.&quot;  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other words, stay out of the US.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course, Mike Lorrey's map would probably say &quot;go wherever you want, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bring your own gun and learn how to shoot first.&quot; ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>I never say just that. THe legalities of lethal force are rather strict,
<BR>
and vary from state to state. Some places if you are physically
<BR>
outmatched (small woman vs/ football player), its quite alright to shoot
<BR>
if you are in fear of imminent bodily harm. Other places shooting is the
<BR>
last thing you can possibly do after all other avenues are exhausted and
<BR>
you are trapped. Massachusetts, for example, had a case a few years ago
<BR>
where a woman and her baby were home, and the ex-husband who had a
<BR>
restraining order againster him broke down four different doors to get
<BR>
to her, she kept retreating with her baby down to the basement, where
<BR>
she shot the ex. Prosecutors tried to claim that she could have pushed
<BR>
her baby out a basement window, even though she was not tall enough to
<BR>
reach it. She did get off, but it was a tough case and is considered the
<BR>
standard in Mass. for use of lethal force to this day. However
<BR>
elsewhere, like Virginia, the anti-car-jacking laws allow the driver, if
<BR>
there are children or elderly people in the car, to shoot someone if
<BR>
they approach the car in the street in a 'threatening manner'.
<BR>
<P>There is a book out that details the concealed carry and lethal force
<BR>
laws for every state. I don't remember its name, I'll try to find out
<BR>
more about it.
