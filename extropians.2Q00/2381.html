2000 8:48 PM,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OSses and apps would have back doors, fed-mandated, and others.
</EM><BR>
<P>As an expert in the security industry, I can assure you that Microsoft
<BR>
backdoors are a well-known fact.  Their registration programs have been
<BR>
caught gathering data and uploading it to Microsoft.  The settings to make
<BR>
Internet Explorer ask before installing software doesn't apply to Microsoft
<BR>
products that use a secret code.  Their website and installation CDs have
<BR>
installed Y2K fixes and Windows-2000 compatibility fixes to Windows-95
<BR>
customers without asking.  Some of their product installations make changes
<BR>
to other products, including their competitors, without asking.  Their
<BR>
servers update clients secretly through backdoors.  Their web clients upload
<BR>
server webpages automatically through backdoors.  Their e-mail and other
<BR>
products execute commands and even override security features automatically,
<BR>
using secret codes.  Even if you have disconnected your network through
<BR>
security settings, Microsoft products have been caught turning on the
<BR>
network and communicating between PCs to catch copies of software running on
<BR>
multiple PCs.  Their latest lawsuit with Sun over Java incompatibilities
<BR>
involved Microsoft putting undocumented backdoors in Java to let their
<BR>
servers access the user's PCs.
<BR>
<P>Many security experts do not feel that it is possible to use Microsoft
<BR>
products securely.  Not just for the bugs, but for the deliberate backdoors.
<BR>
The Department of Defense almost banned Microsoft products as being a
<BR>
security risk.  This is a well-known problem with Microsoft products.
<BR>
<P>These are my own opinions and not endorsed by any of my employers or
<BR>
clients.
