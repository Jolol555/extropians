<P>I'm afraid I fail to understand this logic. When did we suddenly decide

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; argument, which I contested Judge Jackson's claim that consumers were harmed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having to pay more for Windows (and thus any OS) than they should have had to.

<P>This aspect of the case was dealing with preinstalled copies of Windows.
<BR>
I agree that the Linux installation programs are not as easy as the
<BR>
Windows ones. But the vast majority of users have never installed any
<BR>
operating system themselves, and would also have difficulty with that of
<BR>
Windows.
<BR>
<P>(if the tables were reversed and they all had neatly setup Linux
<BR>
installations preinstalled, and were trying to understand things 
<BR>
when trying to install Windows instead, all would be exactly the same).
