<P>
I've begun teleworking in earnest this year - pure teleworking where I'm living 8 hours drive from the org I am coding for, and where I never meet my coworkers in person. Soon I'll be working directly for a US org in the same manner.
<BR>
<P>There's lots of very cool tools for this so far. I've been using Netmeeting with a guy I work with in Australia; I find that using commonly available tools such as internet phone, chat screen and a shared whiteboard are better in many ways than being in the same room, even for initial design work.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, it would still be good to actually be there. Travelling between US and Australia is expensive and crappy. So, what I need is to be able to tele-travel. I'm thinking of companies that rent out robot bodies that you could control via VR helmets/gloves/etc..., so that I could rent a body and get about &quot;in person&quot;, by remote control. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
It seems to me to be a logical next step. Science fiction has been drooling over telepathy and teleportation forever, but what we get are mobile phones, and perhaps soon robotic telebodies controlled via net/mobile networks.
<BR>
<P>Anyone think this is likely in the near future (ie: pre singularity)?
