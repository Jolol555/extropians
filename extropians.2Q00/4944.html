If you check earlier versions of the Principles, you'll see that
<BR>
instead of Perpetual Progress I used to have &quot;Boundless Expansion&quot;. A
<BR>
number of people didn't like that, thinking that it gaving the impression
<BR>
that we wanted to &quot;pave over the universe&quot;. &quot;Expansion&quot; or &quot;unfolding&quot;
<BR>
(thought the latter I don't like as much) *does* more clearly convey
<BR>
multiple paths, or diverse *ways* of making progress. But then how to avoid
<BR>
the &quot;paving over&quot; (and perhaps imperialist) connotations of &quot;expansion&quot;?
<BR>
Suggestions welcome!

<P>I'm (perhaps) a quasi-extropian and I'm not fluent in english (my son says
<BR>
that I'm not fluent at all ...) but may I suggest these expressions:
<BR>
*implicate expansion* or *intensional development*? Actually these
<BR>
espressions do not mean determinism ... but the actualization of some
<BR>
potentiality ...

<BR>
We say, then, that one class of things is substance [ousia], and that one
<BR>
element in this is the material [hylê], which is not in itself an individual
<BR>
[tode ti]. And another is shape or form [eidos], in respect of which - and
<BR>
of no less - we speak of a thing as individual. And thirdly the compound of
<BR>
these two. Now matter is a potentiality [dunamis], but form is an actuality
<BR>
[energeia], and actuality is of two kinds, that of which knowledge is an
<BR>
instance and that of which actual knowing is an instance.
