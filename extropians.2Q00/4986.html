<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I posted a message including a question I was pondering:  Are there people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; who've undergone such radical personality changes that they wouldn't enjoy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; being with their former selves?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I was once a Democrat.

<EM>&gt; There's a somewhat facetious saying: if a young man is not a liberal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he doesn't have a heart; if an old man is not a conservative, he doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a brain.  This may correspond to Robin's suggestion that people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; naturally change over the years for biological reasons and not, as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems, that they are learning what suits them best.

<P>For about 15 minutes, at age 15, I was convinced I was a communist....
