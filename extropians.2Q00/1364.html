<P><EM>&gt; The so-called 'radical' transhumanism is no longer radically futurist - it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is just a philosophical wing of big business and the political mainstream.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This is an interesting accusation. As I see it, the goal of much of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the transhumanist movement has been just to become mainstream. Being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;radical has no intrinsic value if you strive to do something practically.
</EM><BR>
<P>If we agree that Transhumans are part of human mainstream culture (because
<BR>
events have overtaken them rather than because of the efforts of a 'hip,
<BR>
exclusive little group') then what purpose is there for continuation of
<BR>
transhumanism or extropians? If you have nothing radical to impart, then how
<BR>
can you be a futurist?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If your goal is to be part of a hip, exclusive little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;group in order to boost your ego, then it makes sense to try to keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;apart from the mainstream at all costs.
</EM><BR>
<P>You misread me ..... I want the mainstream to move on again, and not get
<BR>
caught in some Transhuman limbo or 'local minima.' What comes after
<BR>
transhuman now that transhuman is the mainstream? Post/ neo or X-human .....
<BR>
and the evolution will be psycho-biological as much as technological.
<BR>
<P>The posthuman egroup list has been discussing better alternatives to human
<BR>
pair-bonding monogamy/ monotony, for example.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As for being a philosophical wing of big business, that seems to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;standard accusation these days. We in Aleph were told that we were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bought mouthpieces of the biotechnology business - I just wonder where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the millions are? :-) In fact, the overall slant among transhumanists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems to be rather anti-corporativists, even if plenty are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;libertarians or otherwise capitalistic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Obviously there are as many political views are there are individuals ... I
<BR>
was making a broad-brush point here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With the adoption of the internet on a wide scale and the NASDAQ
</EM><BR>
explosion,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the  weight of mainstream commercial and media opinion has actually been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;transhuman&quot;, for some time, particularly in the wake of the 2000
</EM><BR>
millenium
<BR>
<EM>&gt; build-up.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This is actually true - our ideas are diffusing into the mainstream at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an accelerating pace. We better keep up with them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Or overtake them, surely! All I am saying is that change and transformation
<BR>
require us to be looking ahead, not just trying to keep pace with the
<BR>
mainstream ..... what comes after trans-human if not post-human?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So the swifter and more positive, radical, option is to declare yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post- or neohuman at the outset, act as though it were true, and wait for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the changes to happen all by themselves!
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh! I'm a jupiter brain. This easter I'm going to act as if I was a
<BR>
~100 km sphere of diamondoid quantum dot cellular automata, surrounded
<BR>
by a corona of solar collectors and radiators and with a mental
<BR>
capacity a few billon times the whole of humanity (it could have been
<BR>
more, but those posthuman screensavers take a *lot* of memory, even
<BR>
when they are not running). I can think billions of superhuman
<BR>
thoughts at once, weaving together strands of ideas without the least
<BR>
risk of getting confused. I understand all of human history and
<BR>
knowledge just as easily as a human could understand a simple
<BR>
equation.  Hmm, let's start with terraforming Sweden...
<BR>
<P>But do you believe the above? It is fairly standard in hypnotherapy to make
<BR>
positive assertions and declarations so the the &quot;subconscious&quot; can bring
<BR>
about the desired effects without interference from the critical mind. I
<BR>
happen to belive that post/neohuman is attainable (indeed has been
<BR>
attained!) by me, whereas my skull wouldn't hold a brain the size of
<BR>
Jupiter.

<P>Ahem, speaking of &quot;content-free,&quot; none of the links you cited in this post
<BR>
have any content.
<BR>
<P>Ooops, blame the www.Att.ac site absence on Ascension Islands InterNic, but
<BR>
the MVT solution to mind-body problem pages at www.multi.co.uk/identity.htm
<BR>
are working as are the www.X-human.com &amp;c.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;www.Enochian-chess.com 6th degree magick &amp; self-initiation
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.........
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Hmm. I would think that the words &quot;magick&quot; and &quot;extropian&quot; would be
</EM><BR>
mutually
<BR>
<EM>&gt;exclusive.
</EM><BR>
<P>Like Newton, I am a practitioner of natural magick (a follower of
<BR>
Constabulus, as was Descartes). As an experimental 'science' it is perfectly
<BR>
in order to reject SUPERNATURALISM as I do, yet follow the path of the Adept
<BR>
in trying to &quot;equilibriate the personality in order to direct the forces of
<BR>
nature.&quot; Magick is about development of the magickal Will and ingenium, and
<BR>
enhancing our capacity for altered states. Transcendance, understanding and
<BR>
control over our environment.
<BR>
<P>Chaos Magick (Pete Carroll) is another natural magick system involving the
<BR>
suspension of disbelief. I see most of the rituals as a form of
<BR>
&quot;role-playing&quot; various deities in order to get an inside guide to their
<BR>
nature or associated powers. Enochian Chess (the enochian system was
<BR>
developed by Elizabeth 1st astrology, John Dee, also used by Golden Dawn)
<BR>
can be played for brainstorming and psycho-strategic purposes even without
<BR>
believing in active divination.
<BR>
<P>After-human magick is of a more effective and truthful type than the occult
<BR>
philosophy from the supernaturalist theistic era. The Primal Eye
<BR>
psychotherapy work that I am involved with is not comparible with the weird
<BR>
atlantean 'Blavatskian' &quot;third eye&quot; theories. Nor am I concerned with flaky
<BR>
extraterrestrial fantasies.
