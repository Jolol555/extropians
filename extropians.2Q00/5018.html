<EM>&gt; Somebody has said that you can go from being a radical, over moderate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and conservative, to become a reactionary, without changing a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opinion in your entire life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyways, some people actually start as reactionary ...uhm.. conservative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and move the other way to become some kind of anarchists at the end.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would they have a different kind of DNA or something?

<P>Thats essentially how I've been. After my 15 minutes as a Red, I was a
<BR>
staunch Young Republican up until age 23 or so, even met George, Neil,
<BR>
and Dubya Bush, Al Haig, William Colby, John Sununu, Judd Gregg and Bob
<BR>
Smith. I was then libertarian with republican sentiments, and am leaning
<BR>
more toward anarcho-capitalism now. I must say that for any of you guys
<BR>
looking for hot intelligent hetero women, the GOP is the place to go. I
<BR>
met more fine fine women at GOP wingdings than just about anywhere.
