<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&quot;Cultural icon Ayn Rand (1905-1982) was known as much for her philosophy as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for her fiction. Her original theory of esthetics, which attacks many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;masterpieces&quot; of modernist art, is as combative and controversial as any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;her work, but until now has received little serious scrutiny. In What Art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is, the authors demonstrate that Rand's ideas are supported by evidence from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other academic fields.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Rand's lack of appreciation for art and the arts outside her own personal
<BR>
opinion (however, she called it objective) was more due to her inability to
<BR>
understand and appreciate knowledge outside her own sphere.  Her rigidity
<BR>
and lack of experience in Contemporary Art seems to be reflective of the
<BR>
rigidity in her psychology and her need for control.  This behavior runs
<BR>
contrary to the open mindedness and curious attitude which can be aroused
<BR>
by fluidity and uncertainty.  Such reactions as feelings of  fluidity and
<BR>
uncertainty stem are emotions experienced form contemporary art and which
<BR>
art modes.  Rand did not have the intellectual flexibility to understand
<BR>
such freeness of intelligent thinking, and such she disregarded as
<BR>
unimportant.  
<BR>
<P>Although an &quot;intellectual&quot;, she lacked a necessary ingredient of an
<BR>
intellectual thinker -- ability to develop knowledge and understanding from
<BR>
areas of thought outside one's one sphere of expertise.   
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;From the Back Cover (also as www.amazon.com)
</EM><BR>
(snip)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;A groundbreaking alternative to this view is provided by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand (1905 1982). Best known as the author of The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, Rand also created an original and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;illuminating theory of art, which confirms the widespread view that much of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;today's purported art is really not art at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>Narrow, limited, uninformed.  This is as ridiculous as claiming that
<BR>
today's purported science is really not science at all.  The subjective
<BR>
aspect of art is whatever the artists chooses his art to be.  the objective
<BR>
aspect of art is represented in the outcome of the artist's ideas -- the
<BR>
product.  
<BR>
<P>I find that art today is so fascinating -- so beyond anything ever thought
<BR>
of years ago -- it's just different.  This evening, I was watching a
<BR>
program on TV with Ray Kurzweil and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, and four other
<BR>
creative thinkers on the subject of &quot;Creativity.&quot;  I loved it.  The
<BR>
consensus was that there are no boundaries on creativity and that a most
<BR>
necessary element of creativity is to allow oneself to explore an open
<BR>
range of possibilities, to make mistakes, to rearrange ideas, etc.  If the
<BR>
only worthwhile art, as Rand preferred, was the Romantic period and artists
<BR>
kept making the same plays, fiction, music paintings and sculpture with the
<BR>
same ol' tools,  there would never have been challenge to artististic
<BR>
creativity.  How contrary to her own values!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&quot;The authors apply Rand's theory to a debunking of the work of prominent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;modernists and postmodernists from Mondrian, Jackson Pollock, and Samuel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Beckett to John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and other highly regarded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;postmodernist figures. Finally, they explore the implications of Rand's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ideas for the issues of government and corporate support of the arts, art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;law, and arts education.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh my.  This paragraph is painful to read.  Pollock (painter), Cage
<BR>
(musician), Cunningham (dancer/choreographer) were brilliant artists whose
<BR>
*innovative* abilities shook the very foundation of the old-world
<BR>
stifling-stamp on what society thought art was supposed to be. Their
<BR>
visionary approach to creativity helped society to break free of
<BR>
intellectual and emotional constraints.
