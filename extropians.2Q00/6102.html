<EM>&gt;Subject: comparison of underground economies (was Commie Nonsense)

<EM>&gt;Date: Sun, 18 Jun 2000 20:35:43 -0500

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So here's a question that occurred to me and led me to use a different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;subject heading for this message.  In which country can there exist a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;healthier underground economy--Mexico or the U.S.?  Will the partial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dissolution of borders change this? As far as I can tell, there seem to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at least 2 underground economies in both the U.S. and Mexico.  One kind is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;controlled by organizations similar to governments where a small elite 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;controls the rest of the parties involved in the economy (&quot;organized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crime&quot;)and, I suspect, though I don't have first hand knowledge, that these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;underground economies have close ties to the governments alongside of which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they operate. The other kind is a true free-market economy. I'm asking the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;question about both kinds, but in particular the latter, the free market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;underground economy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bonnie
</EM><BR>
I haven't seen much evidence of a real free-market underground economy in 
<BR>
Mexico.  The stores in the border cities at least all stock the same 
<BR>
merchandise at the same prices - reminiscent of the old Soviet Union.  It's 
<BR>
pretty obvious that there are bosses behind the scenes taking their cut in 
<BR>
every transaction.  I know people who have second homes down there and have 
<BR>
been themselves involved in both the above and underground economies.  They 
<BR>
assure me that nothing happens without the hierarchy of Jefes approval and 
<BR>
participation.  When I thought about doing some info-organizing in TJ, I was 
<BR>
advised by them to consider the effects on my health.
