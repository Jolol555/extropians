A few general comments and replies.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real/professional criminals will find a way around surveillance,  if
<BR>
there's money to be made  from it. No technology is invulnerable. This leaves
<BR>
the general citizen to be watched, for no good reason.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is scratching your butt in public against the law? Would you want it
<BR>
recorded? How about any number of things you might do which aren't illegal, but
<BR>
you still wouldn't want people to see? How about restrooms? Ought they to be
<BR>
watched? Saying they're not public isn't quite true, since we limit which sex
<BR>
may enter, but no more.
<BR>

Subject: Re: Transparent society

<P>Your feelings are enough to make me submit to surveillance? I think not. Also,
<BR>
do you really expect a desperate person to care they're being watched?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I would like the peace of mind that if we are under constant scrutiny that this
</EM><BR>
will in someway make me feel safer. Why
<BR>
<EM>&gt;would i need to worry about being mugged if a potentail assailent knew his
</EM><BR>
actions would be monitored and therefore he &gt;has a high risk of being caught. He
<BR>
is likely not to bother as the risk will be too great.
<BR>
<P>I say, without reservation, that if this is EVER made law, I'm leaving this
<BR>
country. Period.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    On a slightly different note but very related. One thing I have thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about considerably is the Tagging of the general population. By this you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably guessed I mean Subcutanious Data transmitters giving the identity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and location of any individual.
</EM><BR>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
I assume some people on this list are aware of internet sites which have
<BR>
pictures of up-skirt or down-blouse shots. They'vebeen in the news a lot lately
<BR>
(at least here), so someone else must have seen it. Do you really want cops
<BR>
taking videos of your wife home to watch? I sure don't. And you cannot tell me
<BR>
it won't happen.

<P><EM>&gt;We tend to talk about transparent society as tho it is some kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future threat, but let us look at where we are now.
