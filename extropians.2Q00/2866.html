<P>
During a historical period in China, it was custom to fill government 
<BR>
positions with people who have no evidence that they have ever had a desire 
<BR>
to govern, and anyone who aspired to govern was suspect.
<BR>
<P>If privacy is property, as are all other Rights, how can my property be 
<BR>
taken without due process?
<BR>
<P>Is asserting that only criminals value privacy, the same thing as saying 
<BR>
privacy is contraband?
<BR>
<P>If privacy is only to be held by the govmnt for national security purposes, 
<BR>
then is it not munitions as encryption is?
<BR>
<P>If my personal information has value, and that personal information is made 
<BR>
use of, where is my payment for the use?
<BR>
<P>Can the govment take responsibility for any damage that may be cause because 
<BR>
of dispersal of my property to those who would do me harm?
<BR>
<P>If disclosure of some information that is not volunteered by me causes me a 
<BR>
harm, who is liable?&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><P>------
<BR>
<P><P>After I sent this the first time, I was worried I wrote this in too 
<BR>
obnoxious a
<BR>
way, and given the list's latest arguments, I'm glad no one took me to task 
<BR>
for
<BR>
that.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anway, to respond... (what Spike wrote should be italicized, and below 
<BR>
my
<BR>
response)
<BR>
<P>Here is where I say something that a lot of people are probably going to 
<BR>
tell me
<BR>
I'm full of it for, but -  I don't necessarily limit this to government;
<BR>
companies can be just as bad or worse. (Think of data sifting for ways to 
<BR>
sell
<BR>
you crap you don't need). However, for now, it is govt. which has the real
<BR>
power. I'll say, for this to be honest, I go to at least one place I know is
<BR>
under heavy surveillance by the owners. I couldn't care less. I'll do what I
<BR>
want, and not worry about it. The problem I had was the part where Zero said
<BR>
that only criminals would worry about the surveillance, a variant on the 
<BR>
&quot;anyone
<BR>
not like me must be defective&quot; argument. Why should we have to accept being
<BR>
watched, or be branded a criminal? It may be inevitable that we have a 
<BR>
heavily
<BR>
watched society (given how people seem to live through their tvs, they may
<BR>
simply not protest as much as I do. But then, I'm weird) but do we have to 
<BR>
like
<BR>
it?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big question I have is this - Do we really think people will watch 
<BR>
the
<BR>
government any more than they do now? I mean, what do people care about 
<BR>
C-Span
<BR>
or Monica Lewinsky? The only reason Clinton was impeached was because his
<BR>
'crimes' involved sex. Otherwise, no one would care. Do we really think this
<BR>
'transparent' society (I've GOT to read Brin's book) will get people to pay 
<BR>
more
<BR>
attention? Technology gives out power, I think that's true, but how few 
<BR>
people
<BR>
are willing to use it, no matter how easy it is?
<BR>
<P>From: Spike Jones &lt;<A HREF="mailto:spike66@ibm.net?Subject=Re:%20Transparent%20society&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000511204505.52312.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">spike66@ibm.net</A>&gt;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is not necessarily to stop society from become ever more
<BR>
transparent [which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is like holding back the tide from coming up the beach] but rather to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the way people with power operate.  Such as, arranging
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government so that there are fewer people, less power.  With
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sufficient surveillance, every act of people with power is open
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to public scrutiny.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Do we really want this? I mean, it's difficult to get good people to run for
<BR>
office now, what would the incentives have to be to get anyone to be in 
<BR>
govt?
<BR>
Ultimately I'm in favor of anarchy, but we are a long way from being that 
<BR>
able
<BR>
to self-govern. If we make the dis-incentives for being in office this 
<BR>
strong,
<BR>
will we really be able to attract good, honest people into office? Not that 
<BR>
I
<BR>
have an answer, but I think it's a question about which we ought to think.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Giving people who've shown a fairly consistent record of being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; untrustworthy more power is insane.
</EM><BR>
Right again Mike!  I couldnt agree more.  Those who are
<BR>
untrustworthy with power must come under ever more scrutiny.
<BR>
Anyone who runs for public office must be watched constantly,
<BR>
every move, every word, every deed.  Cameras dont blink.
