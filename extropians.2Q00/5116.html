<EM>&gt; I posted a message including a question I was pondering:  Are there people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who've undergone such radical personality changes that they wouldn't enjoy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being with their former selves?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Someone posted the response that such people would be known as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; schizophrenics. (Sorry, I deleted the earlier posts, so I can't reproduce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them here).

<EM>&gt; What if a person had undergone such a radical personality shift that he wold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loathe his former self and wish to forget the former self as though it(he?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had never existed?  Was the former self a necessary precursor of the present
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self?  If so, could loathing the former self be considered the same sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unpleasant emotion as loathing one's present self?  If it were possible to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destroy or alter a portion of the brain so as to entirely eliminate the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory of the earlier self, would this change the present personality of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person?
</EM><BR>
<P>In extreme cases this could (and has) resulted in dissociative identity
<BR>
disorder (aka multiple personalities disorder). Please not that this is
<BR>
*not* what schizophrenia is (although that is a common misconception).
<BR>
<P>These cases tend to develop in childhood, especially following abuse.
