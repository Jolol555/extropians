</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, I've included my comments, mainly pointing out where the writer is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; either forgetting something, or is completely wrong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course.  Was the writer ever right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Before going on let me state, I don't agree with all that Mr. Thomas says in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his article.  A lot of it is hyperbole -- of which I'm often guilty of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too!:/ -- and some of it appears to a piling on more and more arguments in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hopes that enough of them will be right to sway the reader to agree with all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of them.  But I don't agree with Michael S. Lorrey's _seeming_ whitewash of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the US's role in every war mentioned in the article.  (Note:  I wrote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;seeming&quot; there.  I don't think Lorrey really believes that.  I point this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out for the people on this list who like to put words in my posts that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weren't there or take them out when it will make their arguments appear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;better, stronger, faster.&quot;)

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; MORALITY OF NATO'S BALKAN VICTORY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; by Raju G. C. Thomas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Historical Justice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;             The victors of wars habitually claim that God and morality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were on their side, and that they were incapable of committing crimes. Only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the anquished are&gt; war criminals deserving of all the punishment. In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Versailles Peace treaty of 1919, at end of the First World War, Germany was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; punished severely through the&gt; imposition of exorbitant economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reparations. More significantly it was compelled, on French insistence, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accept a &quot;guilt clause.&quot; Some 19,000 soldiers were&gt; identified by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Entente powers as war criminals at the end of the First World War, none of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them British, French, Russian, or American.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My comments:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The American Army regularly punished its own who were found by courts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; martial to have committed war crimes, though I cannot speak for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; British, French, or Russian armies (note that the Russian Army had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pulled out of the war in 1917 after the Bolshevik Revolution and signed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their own armistice with Germany separate from that of the western
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; allies, one that included no guilt clause, and which made no demands for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; war crimes to be punished, indeed, the Bolsheviks punished the Czarist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; army officers themselves far more harshly than any other army officers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; were in the other armies, including the Germans.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think he is overgeneralizing here, though, usually, the losers in any war
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are always the ones on trial.  Currently, it looks like the Hague will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hear the Yugoslav charge of war crimes against NATO.  Shouldn't they, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least, have their day in court?  (And is bombing a commuter train with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people on it a war crime?  Is bombing a TV station a war crime?  What about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a sweage treatment plant or water pumping station?  Last I heard, this were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not military targets.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Any infrastructure facilities are strategic targets. TV station =
<BR>
propaganda and military coordination capability that was in fact seized
<BR>
by the milosevik government. The commuter train happened to be crossing
<BR>
a bridge that was targeted, the train was not the target.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The specific example Raju G. C. Thomas uses is WW1.  All nations do have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; military courts to deal with bad conduct, though I think his point was that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in this particular war, no British, French, Russian, or Americans were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; punished for particular war crimes.  The Soviets don't really count because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they had a different ax to grind and, no doubt, their purpose in punishing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Czarist officers had more to do with their ideology and making sure there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were no strong threats to their regime than with war crimes per se.
</EM><BR>
<P>I doubt very much that Mr Thomas knows or even cared to research any of
<BR>
the court martial records of the US Army. As far as the Soviets are
<BR>
concerned, the Bolsheviks charged them all with war crimes, mostly
<BR>
against their own people. Whether they had an axe to grond or not is
<BR>
irrelevant. They still punished more than any Germans got punished,
<BR>
which contradicts Thomas' claims.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;       The atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the firebombing of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tokyo and Yokohama, the demolition of Dresden along with its civilians, were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; subject to war crimes trials. The destruction of the people and land of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Vietnam over a period of ten years in the name of freedom are all but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forgotten. There were no&gt; apologies made or compensations paid, but instead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Vietnamese were subjected to American economic sanctions for the next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quarter-century.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My comments:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Strategic carpet bombing of cities that contained defense facilities was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; considered by the US to be barbaric, at least in europe, which is why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the US Army Air Forces all used the secret Norden bombing sight for far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more precise bombing attacks on true military targets, while the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; british, who bombed at night, continued to use carpet bombing due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their bombers innacuracy, and the navigational limitations of flying at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; night.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll have to read up on this more.  I've heard otherwise, but want to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sure about this first.  Certainly Dresden was not a military target and was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bombed specifically as a nonmilitary target.  Only later did the Allies find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out they bombed a lot of POWs there.
</EM><BR>
<P>There was a very good documentary done on Dresden not too long ago. The
<BR>
British were the ones who specifically ran a two wave HE and incindiary
<BR>
mission against Dresden, while the Americans came along later with a
<BR>
targeted mission against a neighboring military facility.
<BR>
<P>Now, are you saying the Germans were housing POWs in the city, as human
<BR>
shields? That, in itself, is a war crime.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Carpet bombing of Japanese targets by the US was considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unfortunate, but considering the psychotic fanatical loyalty to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; emperor of most Japanese people at the time, it was considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; necessary, and considering the lack of respect for the Laws of War that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Japanese showed toward the Chinese people for eight years of prior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; warmaking, it was obvious they did not care to operate by the laws of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; war. Considering the lack of respect for human rights shown by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Germans for Jews, Gypsies, Catholics, Ukrainians, and others, it seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; obvious in retrospect that the Germans had no reasonable expectation to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; see the allies respect the human rights that the Germans dismissed so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; willfully.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This sort of logic would justify anything.  That kind of collectivistic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking is the basis for racism and bigotry of all sorts.  I suppose the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Germans and Japanese who did not support their rulers or whose support was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immaterial or who were too young to even make such choices are somehow as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evil as the regime and its soldiers?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not trying to whitewash the Axis nations here.  Their governments were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dispacable, but does that justify any action taken against anyone living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; within their borders?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not ANY action, however, people get the government they deserve. No its
<BR>
not racist, it merely is true, although you might recall the level of
<BR>
anti-japanese racism here during the war, even kids comic books were
<BR>
using terms like 'nip', 'jap', 'slope', that sort of thing, so I suppose
<BR>
you could lay some blame on racism, though, in fairness, you'd have to
<BR>
look at what sort of racist propaganda the Japanese government was
<BR>
spewing as well, which was significant, as they have always put
<BR>
themselves up as a superior race. Ask any American who was in a Japanese
<BR>
POW camp what THAT was like, if you want to know about war crimes, being
<BR>
used as a subject in chemical and biological warfare experiments. And
<BR>
consider the tens of thousands of 'comfort girls', the korean women
<BR>
enslaved by the Imperial Army. Things like the Bataan Death March were
<BR>
burned in the minds of many Americans by the time we got around to
<BR>
bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Laws of War were created for a
<BR>
reason, and they only work if all sides obey them. When one side stops
<BR>
recognising them, then all gloves are off, and it is only the self
<BR>
respect each side has for itself that restrains it. The Japanese and
<BR>
Germans took the gloves off VERY early, and thus any action on our part
<BR>
in response was justifiable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Likewise, in Vietnam, the US was assisting an internationally recognised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government fight an insurgency backed by a foreign power (North Vietnam,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Russia, and China). That the North Vietnamese Communists and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; southern geurrilla communists refused to operate by the Laws of War when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it was inconvenient for them to do so, but willingly hid behind them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; when it was to their advantage shows that they were not to be trusted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; obey any international convention, and the fact they treated captured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; soldiers and pilots not as prisoners of war should be treated under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Geneva Conventions, but instead labeled them as 'pirates' and 'air
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pirates' so that they could legally torture, maim, brutalize, and kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with impunity, as well as the fact that the southern viet cong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; guerrillas frequently attacked completely peaceful civilian targets,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; non-combatants, and hospital facilities with terrorist bombs illustrates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that they had and have no right to claim any sort of victimhood under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Laws of War.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that North Vietnam and the Viet Cong were pretty much evil, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think the point is that the US government committed many acts of evil too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In such cases, it is best to stay out of the conflict.  The US also, recall,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helped to overthrow the elected government of South Vietnam.
</EM><BR>
<P>They supported a Vietnamese General who overthrew the government that
<BR>
was rife with corruption and penetrated by the insurgents. As stated
<BR>
above, when you don't act in compliance with the Laws of War, when you
<BR>
hide within the civilian population, when you dress as a civilian rather
<BR>
than as a soldier, when you hide your military forces under and withing
<BR>
civilian communities, when you forego conventional military
<BR>
confrontation in favor of terrorist bombs, you give up your right to be
<BR>
protected under the Laws of War, as you become criminals. The NVA had no
<BR>
concern about the Law of War, and never obeyed them except when
<BR>
conducting propaganda pieces for western media or hosting a tour for
<BR>
Jane Fonda.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;       As the Gulf War drew to its close and Iraq accepted an initial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cease-fire that the US rejected, American and British bombers continued to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kill thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Iraqi soldiers fleeing across the open desert with no defense. This does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not qualify as a &quot;Srebrenica.&quot; And nobody will know how many wounded Iraqi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soldiers were&gt; buried alive in the sand by American military bulldozers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after the cease-fire because it was too much hassle to check every body
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lying in the sand.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My Comments:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The Iraqis did not accept a cease fire until a full day AFTER the US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; declared unilateral cease fire had gone into effect. The US declared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that it would cease operations at a given time and date, and the Iraqis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; did not respond until after US combat operations ceased. To counter the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; claims of the author, we will never know how many Kuwaiti women were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; saved from short lives as pleasure prisoners of Iraqi military units due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the air power induced panic imposed on the Iraqi forces. The raping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and pillaging that the Iraqis committed on the Kuwaiti people, IMHO,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; obviated any moral requirement that the Iraqi soldiers be treated with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any respect that normal soldiers deserve. Those soldiers were not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unarmed, they were not non-combatants. Any who surrendered were given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sanctuary, safety, shelter and food (which is far more than they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; received when they were released back to the Iraqi high command, who had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; most shot). Under the Laws of War, any armed soldier is a legitimate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; target, irrespective if he is charging or retreating. A wild dog who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; flees is just as likely to come back for another nip if you don't break
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; him of the habit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I generally agree here the Iraqi military, though I was and am against that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; war and the continued bombings.  I'm not for Saddam or his style of tyranny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or any for that matter), but I don't see why civilian targets have to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; targetted and why the US should support the Kuwaiti regime, which is merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another form of tyranny.  Again, the Iraqi infrastructure and civilians who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were targetted were not military targets -- unless one broadens the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definition so much as to make the distinction arbitrary and useless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And why does the bombing continue?
</EM><BR>
<P>The Kuwaiti government is not a regime, it is a democratically elected,
<BR>
multi-party system. The parliament frequently votes against the Emir (as
<BR>
it recently did when the Emir wrote a law giving women the right to
<BR>
vote, the parliament voted it down).
<BR>
<P>What civilian targets are we talking about? The Iraqis have taken to
<BR>
hiding their military sites now in civilian neighborhoods, to use the
<BR>
communities as human shields. If those communities allow those units to
<BR>
remain, and if they don't leave the area to avoid becoming statistics,
<BR>
they are at least partly culpable in their own demise.
<BR>
<P>Using civilians as shields are war crimes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Some 1.7 million&gt; innocent Iraqis, mainly children, have died slow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deaths because of economic sanctions. But there are no CNN cameras to record
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this tragedy, and besides they died&gt; because of well-intentioned US policy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Such pain, suffering and tragedy do not count in the American concept of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; morality. Meanwhile, Iraq is bombed routinely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; killing untold numbers of soldiers manning military installations or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merely sleeping in their barracks, together with other &quot;unintended&quot; Iraqi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; civilians. These do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; count as war crimes. They are legitimate targets or collateral damage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; yes they are. The children who die cannot be blamed on us. Saddam is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; quite free to import however much food and medicine as he desires.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, he turns around and sells that food and medecine on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; black market to generate money to pay for more weapons, weapons systems,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and for building his weapons of mass destruction. This silly argument is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; much like the terrorist who shoots a hostage and says to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; negotiator,&quot;Look at what you made me do.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think so.  First, what is the goal of the sanctions?  Do you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they will achieve that goal?   If it's to keep Saddam from doing whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad he's doing, they are not working.  Second, if a limitation of war is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limit the pain and killing of innocents, then one must ask who do the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sanctions hurt more?  To borrow Lorrey's analogy, imagine terrorists do take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a house in a neighborhood, would the police be justified in bombing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whole city, killing thousands of innocents in the process?  I don't think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so.  I don't think Lorrey would think so either.  Thus, the sanctions are an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inappropriate &quot;weapon&quot; here.  The reasoning should never be &quot;because X is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evil, any thing we do to stop X is okay, and we can blame X for all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unintended consequences of our actions.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>We don't kill the kids. Saddam has been importing ALL of the medicine he
<BR>
needs to treat the kids. He simply is not letting it get to the kids,
<BR>
get it? And your analogy has NOTHING to do with mine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Notably, Saddam has not been stopped.  He continues to rule and seek ways to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expand his power, the coalition against fell apart mainly because of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US's and Britain's highhanded policy in the region, and the general lesson
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every other nation and people is being taught is that might makes right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kosovo is much the same.  Milosevic is still in power, now the KLA is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; killing Kosovar Serbs, the genocide that never was is generally ignored
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because it's not news, Serbia might be bombed out but it's army is intact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and Russia used the American strategy to its advantage in Chechnya.  (How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the two -- Chechnya and Yugoslavia -- are different is one that will have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be explained to me.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, there is little difference, with the sole exception being that
<BR>
Serbs started killing ethnic albanians first, while in Chechnya, the
<BR>
Chechens started killing Russians first. While Serbia is small enough
<BR>
