Subject: Welcome here, Steve Nichols!  (our resident extropian mesmerizer
<BR>
and wizard)
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Steve, this list can at times be a tough crowd!  I also read over your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;website pages and felt there needed to be much more detailed and scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information on exactly how 'magick' and hypnosis can lead to moving one's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life in a transhuman direction.  It did come off as being very &quot;new agey.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Considering your interests and education it should not be a problem for you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to improve the content and I realize you are just getting started.  I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like how you are trying to find the power and value of ancient systems of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought and religion.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I do think there are some 'timeless' themes on which ancient thought
<BR>
can still be relevent. It helps keep us grounded maybe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I am a big fan of hypnosis and have a strong interest in bettering my own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life.  Do you sell audio or videotapes for self-hynosis?  I have bought
</EM><BR>
this
<BR>
<EM>&gt;type of thing before but never garnered the results I wanted.  I look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;forward to learning more from you.  I hope you new ezine really takes off.
</EM><BR>
<P>I make hypnosis tapes for my clients on a personalised basis having worked
<BR>
with them. Very few &quot;general purpose&quot; hypnotherapy tapes will be much good
<BR>
.... for example, if you have a fear of water the instruction to &quot;float
<BR>
gently down a river&quot; will not be very relaxing, even counterproductive!
<BR>
Individuals have differingexperience of trance, and it helps to address the
<BR>
person by name, and also to have some idea of the type of mentation they
<BR>
experience in trance (lights, colours, noises or mainly kinaesthetic
<BR>
impulses &amp;c.). You can then amplify these, or use cues you know will help
<BR>
the client enter trance.
<BR>
<P>Having said all that, I find Stephen Brookes' (British Hypnosis Research )
<BR>
general purpose tape worthwhile since it is very non-specific, and he is a
<BR>
good hypnotherapist.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for comments about Extropia.net -zine ...... we are busy improving
<BR>
the content continually, and take on board the various points that have been
<BR>
made.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;best wishes,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;John Grigg
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;There is no part of me that is not of the gods &quot;(Mathers)
<BR>
