<EM>&gt; In both cases the benefits of relatively free deployment of the technology

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to support strict keep-it-away-from-lunatics regulation, and nothing like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that has happened.  Which raises an interesting question - why haven't we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had any serious problems with terrorist use of these technologies?
</EM><BR>
<P>Just a theory, but maybe...
<BR>
<P>* In order to effectively use these technologies, one must acquire a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lot of knowledge.
<BR>
* In the process of acquiring said knowledge, people typically learn of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ways to solve problems better (cheaper/faster/more effective) than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;violence and mass slaughter.
<BR>
* By the time one amasses the facilities and knowledge to actually use
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;these in a terrorist capacity, one has usually moved beyond terrorist
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tactics and onto tactics that actually accomplish whatever ends were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;desired.  (Exception: if one is extremely devoted to a cause that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;acknolwedges no solution except death to one's enemies, for instance
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Iraqi weapons labs.)
<BR>
<P>Does this seem plausible, or is there some major logic hole that I'm not
<BR>
seeing?
