<EM>&gt; Speaking of the unhealthy American binge for high-glycemic carbohydrates,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of the worst is sugar. There is a potential alternative in a plant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; substance called stevia, but do a subject search on the net for stevia to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see how it was blocked by bureaucracy and money politics.
</EM><BR>
<P>I assume this is no longer the case, since we have stevia at my place of
<BR>
work and I've also seen it on sale in food stores.:)
<BR>
<P>I agree with the rest of Don's sentiments against the FDA.  Check out
<BR>
www.lef.org for more on the FDA and letters you can send to your
<BR>
Congressperson (for US citizens) if that's the route you want to go.  (I've
<BR>
done this before and intend to keep doing it.  It's a very cheap form of
<BR>
activism.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Stevia has been used by South American Indians for hundreds of years as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sweetener. It currently has about 40% of the sweetener market in Japan and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is also used widely in Europe. It's hundreds of times sweeter than sugar,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but has essentially no calories. It doesn't degrade when heated, so it can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be used for cooking. It has the potential to be a powerful tool in
</EM><BR>
building
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a diet that avoids blood insulin spikes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've used stevia before and I've one problem with it.  This is that it
<BR>
invariably makes everything it touches taste like licorice.  Now, don't get
<BR>
me wrong here.  Licorice is a fine taste indeed.  However, I don't want
<BR>
every sweet thing I eat to taste like it.
<BR>
<P>Aside from that, my way of lowering carbs in my diet is to lower carbs in my
<BR>
diet -- not to seek a sugar substitute.  But I've never been overweight.  In
<BR>
fact, I'm more toward the underweight side of the spectrum.  So perhaps
<BR>
stevia is the answer for some people.  Can't hurt to try.
<BR>
<P>Hope you like the taste.:/
