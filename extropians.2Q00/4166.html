<P>&lt;&lt; If I remember correctly, her order's assets at the time of her death
<BR>
&nbsp;were on the order of US $250M. She was used to being ferried around in
<BR>
&nbsp;the executive jets of her friends -- who included some rather dubious
<BR>
&nbsp;dictators. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;One might argue that if one runs a multinational organisation dedicated
<BR>
&nbsp;to looking after the sick and dying, one ought to be spending a _little_
<BR>
&nbsp;of that money on medical care. And there's a certain contradiction between
<BR>
&nbsp;that vow of obedience, chastity and poverty and a quarter of a billion
<BR>
&nbsp;bucks ... &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>YES!  Many of times she had been seen out sunning herself by her fancy pool 
<BR>
or shopping at Sax 5th Ave on her New York retreats while the sick lay dying 
<BR>
in her hideous dungeons.  I also heard that she had a fondness for exotic 
<BR>
pets!  Many a time she had been noted to bring in &quot;leopards&quot; off the street!  
<BR>
That must have been where she spent all the money, ON EXOTIC CATS!  Ooooh how 
<BR>
she suckered those people at the Nobel Prize association I'll never know.  
<BR>
Why just yesterday I was reading on the Jack T. Chick web site that she had 
<BR>
been seen on a regular basis snorting Coke with the Dalia Lama!  Flaunting 
<BR>
her jewelry at him as they sipped Champaign and laughed at all the little 
<BR>
people.  &quot;Suckers&quot; they would whisper to each other and giggle with delight.
