<P>Abstract:
<BR>
<P>The first 9 inch carbon nanotube based color field emission displays
<BR>
(FEDS)
<BR>
are integrated using a paste squeeze technique. The panel is composed
<BR>
of .576 x 242 lines with implementation of low voltage phosphors.
<BR>
The uniform and moving images are achieved only at V/µm.
<BR>
This demonstrates a turning point of nanotube for large area and full
<BR>
color applications.
<BR>
<P>Speaker Bio:
<BR>
<P>Jong Kim received his Ph.D. in EE from New Jersey Institute of
<BR>
Technology in 1991.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From 1988 to 1992, he served as a Research Associate in Field Emission
</EM><BR>
devices
<BR>
development for the US Army Research Lab. From 1992 to 1994,
<BR>
he worked at Hopewell Junction as a senior development engineer
<BR>
and during that period, was a visiting research
<BR>
Engineer with MCNC( Micro Electronics Center of NC)
<BR>
<P>In 1995, he joined Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology
<BR>
(SAIT) as FED team leader. He was made the director of SAIT's
<BR>
display lab in 1996 and worked on FEDs, high speed LCDs, PDPs,
<BR>
Laser TV, and 3D display development. He now leads the FED team at
<BR>
the Samsung Corporate R &amp; D group
<BR>
<P>Dr. Kim was appointed Director - Electron Source Group, National
<BR>
Creative Initiatives of Korean Government in 1997. He has a
<BR>
number of patents to his credit and has over 130 publications on Field
<BR>
emission related subjects in international journals and technical
<BR>
digests( his team's CNT based FED was listed as news of the week in
<BR>
&quot;Science&quot;, Dec.1999 ).
