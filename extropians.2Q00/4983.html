<P>Somebody has said that you can go from being a radical, over moderate
<BR>
and conservative, to become a reactionary, without changing a single
<BR>
opinion in your entire life.
<BR>

<BR>
and move the other way to become some kind of anarchists at the end.
<BR>
Would they have a different kind of DNA or something?
