I had been away from the list for a few days because I had moved across town.  When I opened up my hotmail inbox I thought for a moment that I was misreading a post heading about Sasha being dead, but very sadly I was not.  I am in a state of shock and disbelief.
<BR>
<P>I have spent many hours pouring our Sasha's colorful website and the innumberable links that branch off from it.  His website fired my imagination and gave me a greater understanding of the great men and women of science.  I loved his list of organizations which he thought worth investigating.  
<BR>
<P>I remember reading his brief bio where he told of his &quot;coming to America&quot; experiences and his desire to live in a better society.  I felt though, that he was a better man for having a foot in two different worlds.    
<BR>
<P>I smiled at his reminisces about serving in the Russian army and being stuck in the middle of a desert with the rest of the guys in his tank unit because some idiotic commander felt they should be there.  I can see how he could bond with others who had served in their own nation's militaries.
<BR>
<P>I had never met him in person.  I did have a few brief correspondances with him.  I was touched that he would offer me work in a private email on behalf of his company, even though I had to tell him I really didn't have the skills they were looking for!  I was still touched that he would think of me.  
<BR>
<P>I was proud of him for having as an extropian, achieved a position of power as the head scientist for his company.  He held out to us all the offer to help get business ideas off the ground!  I hope some of you had what it took to accept his offer.
<BR>
<P>This is so hugely unfair, though I suppose no one said life would be fair.  I am horrified to hear that Sasha was not signed up for cryonics.  He may have thought the singularity would come to be before it was needed for him.  I don't know.  
<BR>
<P>I just want to say I believe there is at least the chance that Sasha has past on to a new existance and that his intellect and personality has not been extinguished.  He may be marvelling right now at the afterlife and feeling very surprised!  I hope so.
<BR>
<P>I always wanted to meet him in person.  Perhaps some day.  My heart goes out to those who knew and loved him.  Eugene, I am so sorry for your loss.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
