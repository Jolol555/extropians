<P>
I have a modest proposal, it's a low tech way to test the Many World's
<BR>
interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and as a bonus it'll make you rich too.
<BR>
First you buy one lottery ticket for tomorrow's 11pm  $200,000,000 drawing
<BR>
then you make a simple machine that will pull the trigger on a 44 magnum
<BR>
aimed at you head at exactly 11:01pm UNLESS yours is the winning ticket.
<BR>
Your subjective experience can only be that at 11.01pm despite 80 million to
<BR>
one odds stacked against you a miracle occurs and the gun does not go off
<BR>
and you're rich beyond the dreams of avarice. Of course for every universe
<BR>
you're rich in there are 80 million in which your friends watch your head explode,
<BR>
but that's a minor point,  your consciousness no longer exists in any of those
<BR>
worlds so you never have to see the mess, it's their problem not yours.
<BR>
<P>I absolutely guarantee this will make you filthy rich, by that I mean after you
<BR>
perform the experiment if you find it doesn't work as I have said all you have
<BR>
to do is tell me and I will happily refund the dollar you spent for the lottery ticket.
<BR>
