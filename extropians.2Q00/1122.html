<EM>&gt; &gt;  I don't, however, feel cold hearted about execution. Anyone who has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  demonstrated no respect for their fellow man is no longer human.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are joining in a self deception that is a dangerous argument; useful when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you are called upon to murder. When you enter into this terrain you join a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charade that has been in place for centuries. Calling humans non-human is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; convenient lie, a fairy tale in order to treat them inhumanly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Calling innocent humans non-human due to unimportant characteristics like skin
<BR>
color, eye shape, gender, or how they rub blue mud in their belly buttons is in
<BR>
fact, evil, and I beleive as you do. Calling non-human humans who have
<BR>
demonstrated by deed as individuals that they do not regard other humans as
<BR>
worthy of living for no good reason (like those no good reasons stated above) is
<BR>
not evil, and is merely putting rabid dogs down.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Richard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ramirez no doubt deserves, really deserves to be treated like animal. But it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not because he really *is* an animal, it is because he is evil.  We have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decided to treat him like one -- out of an abhorrence for what he does -- and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to guarantee our own safety.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He is in a cell alone, no bed, no furniture, only himself on the floor, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his underwear. And there he shall stay until perhaps one day he is murdered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by us.
</EM><BR>
<P>And you don't think he deserves to die? I think its a crime that he's been
<BR>
permitted to live this long.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Not all murderers are inhuman. I know it. I work with them. We make art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; together.
</EM><BR>
<P>You work with children, the 'noble savages'.  We are discussing adults, who
<BR>
supposedly 'know better'. Just because a creature is polite, engaging, and
<BR>
gregarious when it is not on a vicious rampage does not make it human, you might
<BR>
say it is human, but not a civil or civilized human. Goebbels and Hitler were
<BR>
both considered to be gregarious, yet I don't think either of them deserved to
<BR>
live. Mao would go skinny dipping with his 'ladies' between a breakfast on the
<BR>
Yangtse and signing an order to kill off hundreds of thousands of
<BR>
'counterrevolutionaries'.
<BR>
<P>Hitler loved to paint too. Would you have painted with him in prison had we
<BR>
gotten our hands on him? I don't think so.
