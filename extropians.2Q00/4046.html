<P><EM> &gt; &gt;This doesn't happen very much in our online communities.  I think this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt;is in large part because we can't see who's here!  We only see who is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt;talking, we can't tell who is listening.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  On the page you go to on extropy.org to subscribe to this list, there is
</EM><BR>
an
<BR>
<EM> &gt;  option to have the list send you the e-mail addresses of everyone on the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  list. If someone suddenly stops posting, you could check to see if they
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM> &gt;  still on the list. If their name is not on the list, they have (probably)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  not died.. or took the time to unsubscribe just as they took their last
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  gasp.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt;If someone stops posting,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt;has he lost interest, become depressed, or merely decided to observe
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  &gt;for a while without saying much?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  Or become busy.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  If you want everyone online to know if/when you pass away, it would be a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  good idea to keep a list of e-mail addresses, someplace where someone
</EM><BR>
would
<BR>
<EM> &gt;  find it, with directions to make an announcement of your death if it
</EM><BR>
occurs.
<BR>
<EM> &gt;  I have a page which I try to update every month to let people know I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  dead. It has no content. It just says &quot;Today is --- and I am not dead&quot;.
</EM><BR>
The
<BR>
<EM> &gt;  idea is that if that date is several months old, I could be dead.. or just
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  forgot to update it, which I almost always do.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be nice if we had a live chat room where we could at least talk
<BR>
in real time. Or even video conferencing !. Obviously it would be hard to get
<BR>
everyone in the same place at the same time but maybe scheduled talks on a
<BR>
specific topics might be a good idea.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you guys think ? maybe an ICQ room, is there isn't already one.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex.
