<EM>&gt; Unfortunately, the &quot;square/cube law&quot; that works against you re heavier than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; air flying things, works for you in much the same proportion re lighter than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; air craft.  I've often thought that you ought to be able to build a vacume
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dirigible, using foamed metal or ceramic for the hull.  The hull would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very thick, but actually thin relative to the total size.  If you built in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orbit and figured out how to get it down into the atmosphere, you could end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up with a permanent airostat with quite a lot of lift left over.
</EM><BR>
<P>Getting the airship down shouldn't be too hard: ablative panels to take
<BR>
care of the heat, and a one-use rocket to slow the airship down from
<BR>
orbital speeds to get it down just far enough to where air drag can take
<BR>
over.
<BR>
<P>Once you're in the atmosphere, though, you're going to want it to be
<BR>
massive so it can be stable (partly so significant weight changes, as
<BR>
things land or take off or shift around, don't upset the whole works).
<BR>
Alternately, you might want to add semi-flexible containers (which bend
<BR>
when you give a signal, but stay rigid at all other times), or maybe
<BR>
make part of the edges this way; which would allow you to shift lift as
<BR>
required, or even lose lift and be able to gain it back later if, say, a
<BR>
visiting 777 takes off.
