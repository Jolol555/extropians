<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One of the philosophical objections sometimes raised here against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immortality is that you would change so much over a long lifespan as to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have little relation to the being you were originally. In that case,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the original person is really gone, just as surely as if he had died.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All that is left is someone who was influenced, perhaps only marginally,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the person who began the process.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;This wouldn't mean that you could never change, only that as you do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;change, you would remember the person you used to be. Even as your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tastes, desires and beliefs change, you would continue to at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;occasionally do things the way your old self would have wanted. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would cultivate a sense of connectedness to your past and future,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;put down roots into your own timeline.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Hal,
<BR>
<P><P>Perhaps this is a prosaic suggestion to something more imaginative
<BR>
that you might have been holding in your mind, but
<BR>
<P>How about recording ourselves using the suggestion I said some
<BR>
weeks back? (Answering &quot;What does it feel like to be ME?&quot; at
<BR>
regular intervals.) It conects backwards, but one can always
<BR>
make committments to future selves at the same time.
<BR>
<P>It's a way to see our own tracks through our own life-forest.
<BR>
Looking at one's life-tracks can be enlightening. It also
<BR>
shows how the sum of every experience makes us who we are today.
<BR>
<P>(I don't agree with the &quot;influenced, perhaps only marginally part&quot;,
<BR>
that you wrote. Yes, we can change ourselves in large ways over
<BR>
long lifetimes, but we are still the sum of or experiences, what
<BR>
we have learned.)
<BR>
<P>Amara
<BR>
<P>&quot;If this is today, I must be where I am.&quot;  --Ashleigh Brilliant
