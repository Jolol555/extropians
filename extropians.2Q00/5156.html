The July issue of Wired (the one with Sealand/HavenCo on the cover)
<BR>
has about ten pages of responses to Bill Joy's article on the danger of
<BR>
21st century technologies.  85 different readers respond.
<BR>
<P>I expected, given Wired's generally upbeat take on the prospects
<BR>
for future technology, that readers would rake Joy over the coals
<BR>
as we have done here.  To my disappointment, most of the responses
<BR>
are generally favorable.  At a minimum they applaud Joy and Wired for
<BR>
publishing this &quot;important&quot; document and bringing these issues forward
<BR>
for public discussion.  Many of them express agreement with Joy's (and
<BR>
the Unabomber's) forebodings.
<BR>
<P>Even names which I recognize as being technology advocates often have
<BR>
something good to say about Joy's warning:
<BR>
<P>Bruce Sterling, author, Distraction: It's a good, healthy development to
<BR>
see some ubergeek guy come out of the obscurantist shadows, step right
<BR>
up to the public podium like a responsible adult, and bluntly come up
<BR>
with a moral crisis and a personal confession....  I strongly approve
<BR>
of this approach on his part; clearly you should always have the moral
<BR>
crisis *first*.
<BR>
<P>Tim O'Reilly, president, O'Reilly &amp; Associates: I am mindful of the
<BR>
farewell speech that Sir Joshua Reynolds gave to the Academy - his
<BR>
repudiation of a lifetime of academic art, and a call for a return to the
<BR>
passion of Michelangelo.  Edmund Burke, who was in the audience, rose up
<BR>
and strode down the aisle, saying, &quot;I've heard an angel speak.&quot;  I could
<BR>
only wish that our own political leaders would be so moved by Joy's words.
<BR>
<P>Ray Kurzweil, inventor and author of The Age of Spiritual Machines: Bill
<BR>
Joy and I have dialogued on this issue both publicly and privately, and
<BR>
we both believe that technology will and should progress, and that we need
<BR>
to be actively concerned with the dark side.  If Bill and I disagree, it's
<BR>
on the granularity of relinquishment that is both feasible and desirable.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandonment of broad areas of technology will only push them
<BR>
underground, where development would continue unimpeded by ethics
<BR>
and regulation.  In such a situation, it would be the less stable,
<BR>
less responsible practitioners (e.g., the terrorists) who would have
<BR>
all the expertise.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I do think that relinquishment at the right level needs to be part
<BR>
of our ethical response to the dangers of 21st-century technologies.
<BR>
By itself, fine-grained relinquishment won't solve these problems, but
<BR>
it will give us more time to develop the necessary defensive technologies.
<BR>
<P>Vernor Vinge, author, A Deepness in the Sky: Granularity of relinquishment
<BR>
is a nice way to think about all this.  There may also be categories
<BR>
or levels.  Categories of relinquishment that require nonrelinquished
<BR>
enforcement are probably bad.  Hopefully the debate will continue into
<BR>
post-human forums :-).
<BR>
<P><P>It appears that &quot;relinquishment&quot; will be the new buzzword for the 21st
<BR>
century, with the debate only over which technologies go on the Index
<BR>
of Forbidden Works.  I'm sure we can count on every interest group
<BR>
which hopes to coerce others to find ways to couch their demands in the
<BR>
language of relinquishment.  I can't wait to see what Greenpeace or the
<BR>
Moral Majority call for us to relinquish next.
