<P><EM>&gt; It almost sounds like you are saying that the ends justifies the means.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is, as long as another person is similar enough to you to carry out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your plans, you don't need to exist anymore.  You don't seem to want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue living just because you like to be alive, but to acheive some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future goals.  As long as someone else is programmed with your meme-set to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; carry out your goals, you seem ready to die.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sort of.  I think certain means are justifiable by ends, and that stunting
<BR>
a consciousness stream is one of them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Why did you want to preserve your &quot;self&quot; (as such) in the first place?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't have a good proof for why I shouldn't die.  I just would like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; avoid it.  It seems like you question whether self-preservation is a useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goal.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I was asking the question rhetorically.  I want to preserve my &quot;self&quot;
<BR>
as well.  That's an end that I pursue for its own sake.  If it somehow
<BR>
came to light that &quot;I&quot; was really my consciousness stream, then that's
<BR>
what I'd want to preserve.  But I don't think it's very likely that this
<BR>
will somehow come to light; I think I'm going to be the one making the
<BR>
decision for myself, and so, in light of that, I'd better make the
<BR>
decision based on my goals.  (The goal &quot;preserve myself&quot; being a not very
<BR>
relevant goal, seeing as that goal sheds no light on what I am, or what
<BR>
sort of definition of &quot;me&quot; I ought to have.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; More to the point, if &quot;you&quot; turn out to be the program that's running on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the fantastic machine that is your body, then shutting down a copy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shouldn't be too big a problem.  If you happen to be your current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consciousness stream, or control over it, or whatever, then destroying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that is a pretty big deal as far as our primitive desires are concerned.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is where the semantic problems come in.  We do not all agree on what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the self.  I don't know all the answers, but I find it hard to agree with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definition of self that allows selves I cannot detect.  I don't know if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their are other copies of me.  How can they be me if I don't even know that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they exist?  I think, therefore I am.  But I cannot think with the copy's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brain, anymore than I can think with your brain.  Until I get a replacement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brain that I can think with, the replacement is unacceptable.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the answer is obvious: one consciousness stream might not be aware
<BR>
of another similar consciousness stream, but &quot;you&quot; (the collective bounded
<BR>
by the predicate &quot;is Harvey Newstrom&quot;) are necessarily aware of all of
<BR>
&quot;you&quot; simultaneously.  You(1) are aware of you(1), you(2) are aware of
<BR>
you(2), so some member of you is aware of you(1), and some member of you
<BR>
is aware of you(2).  So &quot;you&quot; are aware of all of you, even on the
<BR>
&quot;adjective&quot; view.
<BR>
<P>If you can't feel your hand, does that mean the hand isn't part of you?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I take it as axiomatic that our goals, our ends, are what we are striving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for; that the correct goals/ends are the correct things to strive for.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; With that in mind, do we have it as a goal to preserve our current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consciousness stream?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahem.  You have it as a goal to preserve your &quot;self,&quot; but you have chosen
<BR>
to define &quot;self&quot; as consciousness stream.  I'm arguing that this was a
<BR>
mistake, that you'd be better served with another definition.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If self-preservation is just to create a new individual and allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ourselves to die, then why limit ourselves to exact copies?
</EM><BR>
<P>Uhm, your phrasing of my position is especially loose here.  But anyway,
<BR>
as I noted earlier, I DON'T limit myself to exact copies; pretty recent
<BR>
(within months) seems OK to me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why not make better individuals?  Why not genetically engineer our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; children or build a race of superior robots?  All of these may be fine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goals, but they have nothing to do with my personal survival.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continuing this current consciousness stream is not the goal, then why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make the copy similar to me at all?
</EM><BR>
<P>You knew the answer to this before you said it.  It's because the copies
<BR>
have the similarity of meme-sets, the similarity of goals, necessary in
<BR>
order for someone to be pursuing my goals with the special interest with
<BR>
which I pursue them.
<BR>
<P>Replacing me with you, on the other hand, is unacceptable.  (Though I
<BR>
might even go for that if the goal were important enough and I knew you
<BR>
shared it with me.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; As far as I can tell, the answer is no.  My lizard brain has nothing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; say about whether I'm an adjective, as John Clark has been known to put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it, or a noun, as you might have it.  My intuitions just tell me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; preserve &quot;myself,&quot; and to avoid &quot;death.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a twin.  He is not me.  I have had some people tell me that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couldn't tell us apart.  This does not convince me that I can die.  I still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perceive an obvious difference between him and me.  I have never gotten us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confused.  I am obviously in this body, and he is obviously in that body.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No similarity in thinking or perceptions will suddently merge our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousnesses into a single individual.  From that point of view, I must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insist that different similar objects can and do exist.  The question is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not, &quot;Does the universe need two Newstrom brothers?&quot;  The question is, &quot;Do I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to continue living?&quot;  I see no connection between these two queries.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yet, I posit, you just might die for your brother given a pretty good
<BR>
reason.  And he just might die for you.  This should be a hint to you to
<BR>
probe your intuitions further on this matter: if these desires are coming
<BR>
from your primitive imperatives, then, as far as I can tell, the primitive
<BR>
imperatives are not only willing to make exceptions for exact copies, but
<BR>
also exceptions for someone who shares only your genes.  (Or even just
<BR>
half your genes, in the case of your children.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; In light of that, and in light of my other goals, it seems to me like it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; might be most efficacious to choose the definitions of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;death&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; under which I'm best able to accomplish my goals.  Now, only *I* have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; special knowledge of my own goals, and therefore *I* am in a unique
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; position to pursue them.  But as far as I can tell, the most useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; definition (from the point of view of my goals) is the &quot;adjectival&quot; view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know what you are saying, but it sounds too much like fudging the answer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A lot of people on this list like to choose definitions that best support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their goals.  Sometimes reality is not cooperative.  Sometimes things are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not the way we want them to be.  I think we need to answer the questions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about reality first, and then choose goals that are possible within that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality.
</EM><BR>
<P>Look, it's not like we can perform an experiment to check and see if a
<BR>
copy is &quot;really me&quot; or not.  This is a matter of definition, it's a matter
<BR>
that we have to decide for ourselves on the basis of our other beliefs and
<BR>
desires.  I take it that the most you can say on this point is that my
<BR>
definition doesn't jive with your goals, not that my definition doesn't
<BR>
line up with reality.
<BR>
<P>But if it doesn't jive with your goals, with which goals does it conflict?
<BR>
I've already made the case that it doesn't conflict with your desire for
<BR>
&quot;self&quot; preservation, whatever &quot;self&quot; turns out to be. Rather, instead, it
<BR>
only seems to conflict with your goal to preserve consciousness streams.  
<BR>
And as far as I can tell, you adopted that position because you took it
<BR>
that this was the only way to preserve your &quot;self&quot;.  I'm arguing that this
<BR>
is not the case, that you can preserve yourself while stunting your own
<BR>
conciousness streams.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Continuing my consciousness stream is my goal.  You seem to discount this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goal and ask what other good goals come out of my life.
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  I discount this goal as a conflation with the goal of preserving your
<BR>
life.  They are distinct.  One goal demands you preserve your &quot;self;&quot; this
<BR>
goal remains mute on what the self is.  Another goal demands that you
<BR>
preserve your consciousness stream.  This goal is substantially different
<BR>
from the former, and I can find no motivation for asserting that these
<BR>
goals are the same, or deserve the same weight.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If I can't come up with any great purpose for my life, should I kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself?  Maybe I will think up a great purpose later.  For now, maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll just stick around for the entertainment value.  Continuing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness is a goal in and of itself.  If this stops, why would I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; care about any other goals that occur afterwards?
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I can grant you all this.  I'm more than happy to say that my life
<BR>
is an end in itself.  But I have to choose what constitutes me.  Are you
<BR>
going to take the hard line that &quot;defining myself as a consciousness
<BR>
stream&quot; is an end in and of itself?  If so, then I suppose I really can't
<BR>
persuade you to give it up.  But I bet you don't take defining to be an
<BR>
intrinsic goal, that you've taken it up on account of other goals that you
<BR>
have.
