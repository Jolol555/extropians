<P>
You may have heard by now about how the national missile defense
<BR>
is all a big reaganesque fantasy, etc.  I was just wondering if anyone
<BR>
here has any strong opinions in this regard.
<BR>
<P>The local paper, the San Jose Mercury News, decided to cash in
<BR>
its credibility thus: they ran an article with a column on the front page
<BR>
and the entiiiiirrrre baaack paaaage, going on and on about how the
<BR>
concept is flawed, would neeeeever work, how it was all a big boon-
<BR>
doggle, how 4 out of 5 defense scientists surveyed agreed it would
<BR>
never work, etc.  That was in Wednesday's paper.  The entire back
<BR>
page.
<BR>
<P>In all that verbiage, there was not one word in there, not a single word,
<BR>
about the last two THAAD missile firings, both successful.  I suppose
<BR>
there was some bizarre line of reasoning that lead to the decision that the
<BR>
<P>fact that a feat has already been accomplished is irrelevant to the
<BR>
arguement of whether or not it is possible.
<BR>
<P>The saaaammme daaaaay that the huge negative article was running, the
<BR>
defense scientists at Sandia used a ground base laser to destroy an
<BR>
incoming missile.  Think about that for a minute.  That story was
<BR>
reported in the Merc, on page 10A, twoooo seeennnntences, one of
<BR>
which was totally irrelevant to the event, having to do with Israelis
<BR>
vs Lebanese or something.  So.  One sentence.  Vs the back page.
<BR>
<P>I would have let it drop, but today they ran ANOTHER eeyore
<BR>
article.  you remember Eeyore, the donkey?  Dismal, droopy
<BR>
character, not extropian at all:  &quot;It'll never wooork, oh deeear,
<BR>
woooe is meeee...&quot;, whereas Tigger is more my style, bouncing
<BR>
around on his tail, always having fun and enjoying life: Woo hoo!
<BR>
Wooo hooo!
<BR>
<P>So I fired off a letter to the editor, scolding him, asking if they
<BR>
had anyone there at that paper who was responsible for *balance*.
<BR>
In the Eeyore article, there was no actual news.  All of it was
<BR>
merely political commentary.  When an actual news item happened,
<BR>
they gave it two sentences.  Was this the Mercury *News*, or was
<BR>
it the San Jose Mercury Propaganda Sheet?  Could they manage
<BR>
to mix a little Tigger with the Eeyore?
<BR>
<P>I know some say the National Missile Defense could be made
<BR>
to work but shouldnt.  I guess we need to wait until a city
<BR>
is actually nuked off the face of the earth to start developing
<BR>
such a thing?
<BR>
<P>What say ye, extropians?  spike
