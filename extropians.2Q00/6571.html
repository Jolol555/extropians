Hi

<EM>&gt;Certainly, by altering genes related to insulinlike resistance or genes for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;SOD and catalase you can extend the lifespans of mice, fruitflies and even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worms...and by supplementing with things like CoQ10 you can increase average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lifespans of mice... but the processes are so wickedly coupled that the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;biological way you'll get to that 1,000 year birthday is by modifying the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;action of dozens or scores or thousands of genes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wasn't saying that p66 (the gene leading to 40% life extension in mice)
<BR>
was the cause of aging. I was merely pointing (as there are other examples)
<BR>
that senescence might not involve so many genes as you're saying. I agree
<BR>
many genes affect aging. But if we can eradicate senescence probably most
<BR>
age-related diseases will disappear; while some will remain and we'll
<BR>
afterwards need to eliminate them too.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As you extend the lifespan horizon you're going to collide with even more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;forbidding barriers to eternal youth... barriers that are not directly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;placed by simple darwinian restrictions on optimum individual reproductive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lifespan, but that arise from the fact that we metazoans are all clonal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;colonies. You'll have to keep redesigning  the entire genome as you push the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;threshold back...
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree. But we have to take one step at a time. First end senescence, then
<BR>
take care of the other diseases (what I call post-mortem lethal genes).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Already, there is some evidence that ageing in the &quot;young old&quot; is of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different nature than ageing in the oldest old. The oldest old are a genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;elite who have withstood the killing processes that plague us early on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But they die nevertheless...and the mechanism of their ageing seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different. Overtly cellular processes as opposed to system processes seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kick in. So we may end up peeling an onion in the quest for biological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;immortality.
</EM><BR>
<P>I find that hard to believe. Do you have any data showing different causes
<BR>
of death in centenarians and people, say, from 65 to 100? I don't think you
<BR>
do. Until further evidence I follow Occam's razor: 1 cause of senescence
<BR>
instead of 2.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Lastly, in species where death by predation, misadventure etc. is high and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thus there is no real &quot;danger&quot; of loading the gene pool with oldies (...the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;survival curve will be exponential anyway!!) we should sometimes see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long-lived non-ageing species. Maybe sea turtles; carp; and certain catfish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fit this model to a certain extent...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But then they STILL eventually age and die when captive reared  in suitable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;habitats. Is ageing different then... are they coming up against cellular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ageing constraints specific to the genetic complexities of being a metazoan?
</EM><BR>
<P>That's new! Do you have any references showing Marion's tortoise's aging in
<BR>
captivity? Or the Galapago's tortoise? Or lobsters? Or rockfishes? I've
<BR>
never read one single paper showing aging in any of these species, either in
<BR>
the wild or in captivity. Besides, I didn't get your argument of species
<BR>
with higher mortality being the ones where one can most easily find
<BR>
long-lived and non-aging individuals?!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Just because you can find several instances where fixing up ONE gene can add
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;another 50% or 100% to maximum lifespan does not mean that INDEFINITE life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extension is easy... on the contrary the finding that fixing any one or two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of a set of many totally different genes can do this... seems to indicate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that a very complex system is at work...
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course there are backup-ups and overlapping pathways but finding single
<BR>
genetic lifepan determinants (of over 50 or 100%), as I said before, is
<BR>
what's expected if aging is governed by a simple mechanism (and it is not
<BR>
expected if aging is governed by thousands of genes).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Fixing such systems so that they'll achieve biological immortality seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me well nigh impossible.
</EM><BR>
<P>What a lack of vision and ambition! Even if you are right, you can't be sure
<BR>
of it and should well damn try to end aging. I'm a gerontologist and I might
<BR>
fail in my mission but I will never give up.

<EM>&gt;If you have *nothing* but a variety of accumulating late-acting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pathologies, that alone will create &quot;aging&quot;: increasing mortality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plus decreasing function accumulating thoughout life, following 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a roughly Gompertzian curve.  So the pathologies can indeeed be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the basic cause of aging.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, the phenotype of aging does not indicate such an origin. I'll tell you
<BR>
why: (1) the large differences in aging phenotypes amongst closely-related
<BR>
species indicates simple mechanisms (for example, amongst teleosts); (2)
<BR>
Occam's razor: what's easier to evolve, 100 mutations for age-related
<BR>
diseases or 10 mutations upstream of age-related diseases; (3) Gompertz'
<BR>
curve is not a rough one; in human populations it shows a good correlation
<BR>
(see Hayflick's book) (4) there is only one age-related dysfunction
<BR>
(presbyopia) that affects all humans; so, unless thousands of back-up
<BR>
pathologies are constantly at work, your argument does not stand; (5)
<BR>
despite what I said in (1), in mammals that is not true. Mammals have a
<BR>
large amount of similarities in the aging process (read Finch's book for
<BR>
references). If aging is just the diseases that evolved due to lack of
<BR>
evolutionary pressure in old ages, then larger differences are expected. Yet
<BR>
mice -- with maximum lifespans of 5 years -- have roughly the same diseases
<BR>
we do at age 65. And the best (and simpler, I'm sure you can think of other,
<BR>
more complex and therefore more unlikely, explanations) explanation is that
<BR>
there is a single mechanism causing aging in mammals that in turn leads to
<BR>
all age-related diseases. (You might be confused of what I said in (4) but,
<BR>
although (4) is true, the fact is that the statistical distribution of
<BR>
age-related pathologies and causes of death in captivity is quite similar
<BR>
amongst mammals; there are punctual differences: for example, mice have
<BR>
higher incidences of kidney failure than humans; but in general this is true
<BR>
for all well-studied mammals.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;and (ii)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  the negative benefits of loading the genepool with archaic combinations in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  the face of rapid environmental change....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Man, it seems like I have this argument a lot!  That's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not really a problem; if the archaic combinations are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bad, the possessors will be dead anyway. Often, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;archaic combinations will carry valuable information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which is being lost due to fluctuating selection or drift.
</EM><BR>
<P>Read Bowles J, 2000. He makes a good argument against what you just said.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes.
