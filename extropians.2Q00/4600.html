<P><EM>&gt; A dictatorship implies an organization capable of resorting to violence to

<EM>&gt; enforce its will. Corproations do not have this ability. There are no IBM

<EM>&gt; secret police arresting their rival's customers, no Microsoft assassins
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eliminating key enemy personnel, and no armies of Dell and Compaq
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infantrymen clashing to secure the buying public's dollars.
</EM><BR>
<P>The only reason corporations can't use violence is because there's
<BR>
someone bigger and nastier who won't let them. Under anarcho
<BR>
capitalism there would be no such constraint, in which case they're
<BR>
free to detonate and maim to whatever extent the benefits outweigh the
<BR>
PR costs. Would people boycott a company that assassinated it's rivals?
<BR>
Maybe, but the same people keep reelecting politicians who advocate
<BR>
similar solutions to perceived domestic and foreign problems. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The only thing companies can do now that they couldn't do in a pure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anarcho-capitalist society is bribe politicians to pass laws - and lobbying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for protectionist legislation is one of the few things I haven't heard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft accused of.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Since companies buy and sell the stuff, it seems only natural to me that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anarcho-capitalism will not work too well in that environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The PC market is one of the least regulated markets in existence. It should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; therefore be expected to work better than most other markets, and any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; failures it does exhibit should be a result of government intervention.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're drawing a false dichotomy here - either markets are perfect, in
<BR>
which case they should never be regulated, or regulation is superior
<BR>
and everything should be decided from the top down. Why can't the
<BR>
optimum be a mix of the two? I think there are instances where
<BR>
regulation can improve the functioning of a market. It does not
<BR>
logically follow that I think government ought to be deciding how many
<BR>
bars of soap get manufactured.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, what do you do when a company you consider to be inferior comes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dominate the market? Accusing them of evil anti-competitive practices misses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the point - companies would do the same kinds of things in a stateless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society, and in that case there would be no one to stop them. No, there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really only two viable explanations: either free markets don't actually work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very well, or your personal evaluation of which companies ought to do well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is somehow flawed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Free markets work, in general, very well indeed - that doesn't mean
<BR>
there aren't situations when they don't. Who 'ought to do well' is a
<BR>
function of what you're trying to optimize. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, the interesting thing here is that our standard arguments for why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; central control is bad predict that the second explanation will usually be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correct. In general, I can't reliably tell which product is best for you,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can't predict which one is best for me, and neither of us can speak for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tom, Dick or Harry. It should therefore not be surprising if the dominant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; product in an industry isn't the one you like - all that means is that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the market has different needs than yours.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then government is optimal. Model the historical evolution of top-down 
<BR>
control as a bottom-up market process and the aggregate result of billions of
<BR>
locally  rational, self-interested decisions. If you don't think the best
<BR>
political/economic system won the market, you're just another mistaken expert
<BR>
trying to out-guess the emergent result.
