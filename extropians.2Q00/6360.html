<P><EM>&gt; By itself this observation doesn't seem to establish your conclusion.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would agree.  I've suggested before, I think, that it will take
<BR>
something like extensive SNP analysis or a lot of DNA sequencing
<BR>
on a cell by cell basis to *really* settle this question.  It is
<BR>
however a smoking gun...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The fact that DNA is damaged, and damage accumulates, doesn't imply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it is a cause of the phenomenon that we call aging.  It could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be that aging is caused by something else, and that while DNA damage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would eventually lead to death, the symptoms and the time scale would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be completely different from what we think of as aging.  Maybe you'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live 1000 years and then your cells would all turn to cancers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, probably not.  It seems that after a period of time, (70-90 years),
<BR>
cancer rates start to decline.  When the unravel the genetic background,
<BR>
I suspect they will discover a &quot;gene combination&quot; that just &quot;happens&quot;
<BR>
to have fantastic DNA repair and a lack of genes that turn environmental
<BR>
substances into carcinogens.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There may be other reasons to believe that DNA damage is a cause of aging,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but the mere fact that damage accumulates over time isn't enough.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Its the observations in aging (decline in protein synthesis, changes
<BR>
in hormone levels, decreased cellular replication ability, etc.)
<BR>
that lead to the plausibility that the original program is being
<BR>
damaged over time.  This fits into the dysdifferentiation hypothesis
<BR>
of aging if as mutations accumulate they gradually distrupt the
<BR>
ability of the cell to maintain its differentiated state.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As we've discussed before, intentionally producing brainless humans is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not going to be considered by most people as a way to resolve ethical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issues.  Rather, it raises a host of questions of its own.  Start off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with Huxley's Brave New World and discuss whether that system, which has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some similarities to this idea, is moral.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, individuals such as myself who haven't read BNW aren't going
<BR>
to be interested in what it says if we can make a pre-emptive argument.
<BR>
a) Here is a live person with &quot;lots&quot; of information/experience/etc.
<BR>
b) Here is a &quot;body&quot; we can grow that will be constructed in such
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a way that it has nothing other than pre-programmed information and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no experience (as well as no consciousness, self-awareness, free-will,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc.)
<BR>
c) (a) is more valuable than (b) [from an information content standpoint]
<BR>
d) Making (b) and using it to preserve (a) is the correct thing to do
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(if one assumes organized information is valuable as presumably
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most extropians do).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In particular, the epsilons are produced by poisoning their brains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; during development so they are nearly mindless, drooling automatons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's not a very attractive image.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, and &quot;attractiveness&quot; isn't something I personally care about
<BR>
when it comes to whether we will kill individual.  I'll *rationally*
<BR>
adopt the position of a physician in a triage situation who has to
<BR>
save the greatest number of lives with the resources and techniques
<BR>
at his disposal.
<BR>
<P>If a person doesn't want to be &quot;saved&quot; using a &quot;clone&quot;, then that
<BR>
is their choice, but if the technology could exist, then I strongly
<BR>
object to society making that choice for me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is it reasonable that as many as one cell in 30 has escaped harmful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DNA mutations, so that it is in good enough shape to create a whole new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organism from scratch?  These are ordinary cells that have been dividing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and growing and metabolizing for a substantial fraction of the lifespan of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the animal.  If DNA damage is the limiting factor, I would have expected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ordinary tissue cells to be more than 30 times worse than the egg cells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which presumably have extra protection against damage).
</EM><BR>
<P>The devil is in the details here of course.  I would have to go through
<BR>
the literature to refresh my memory, but I'm fairly certain that
<BR>
transcribed genes and replicating tissues have higher levels of DNA repair
<BR>
than untranscribed/replicated genes (RNA or DNA polymerase get &quot;blocked&quot;
<BR>
while running down the strand and that triggers a repair response).  So that
<BR>
allows damage to preferentially accumulate in the non/rarely transcribed
<BR>
or copied genes (particularly in the developmental program).  There is a low
<BR>
level of generic repair that occurs but it is not clear how complete or
<BR>
effective it is.
<BR>
<P>This makes sense -- why would you want to expend resources repairing
<BR>
genes that the average cell will never use again?  Now the *sticky*
<BR>
part comes into play with the *rarely* executed subroutines.  You
<BR>
only execute the apoptosis (cell-death) program once, but presumably
<BR>
when the immune system tells a cancer cell to execute that program
<BR>
you *would* like it to work (at least most of the time)...
<BR>
<P>In looking at this it seems to me that nature will have tuned
<BR>
repair mechanisms (you don't think running ECC checks on 3x10^9 BP/cell
<BR>
that are receiving thousands+ mutations/day is cheap do you???)
<BR>
to match the requirements -- &quot;frequently used programs&quot; ==
<BR>
&quot;highly active repair&quot;, &quot;less used programs&quot; == &quot;less active repair&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;never used programs&quot; == &quot;very rare repair&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Since it isn't a well designed system you would expect some
<BR>
overlap between the groups.
<BR>
<P>So I stand by my position that the program is likely to be highly
<BR>
defective in those processes that clones will require (leading to
<BR>
many clonal failures).  [This agrees with normal human reproductive data.]
<BR>
The corrolary of that situation would appear to me to be part of
<BR>
the aging process, in that lesser used parts of the program
<BR>
(e.g. those subroutines that stimulate slow-dividing stem cells
<BR>
to divide) are likely to have problems.  Lose your stem cells
<BR>
(in replicative tissues) and you eventually lose the organism.
