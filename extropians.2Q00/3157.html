<EM>&gt;     &gt;I claim that they are thinking the same thoughts because the copy's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;blank brain just got overwritten with the original's thoughts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If a computer file is overwritten by the exact same file it is not erased.
</EM><BR>
<P>What does this have to do with my statement above?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; My definition of &quot;one&quot; person is:  single consciousness not about to
</EM><BR>
diverge
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; in thinking, in a single location, connected to all parts of itself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A brain can not detect its position so if consciousness even has a
</EM><BR>
location
<BR>
<EM>&gt; (Where is &quot;red&quot; or the number 17?) it must be  where its sense data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; originated. It's easy to put a splitter on a data line so several
</EM><BR>
different
<BR>
<EM>&gt; conscious entities could exist at the same location, or several brains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could generate the same consciousness at the same location.
</EM><BR>
<P>You misunderstood my definition.  I was not defining &quot;consciousness.&quot;  I was
<BR>
defining the difference between &quot;one&quot; and &quot;many.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Your definition of &quot;one location&quot; is imprecise.  A splitter puts data on two
<BR>
lines.  Even if you say the two lines are &quot;in the same location&quot;, they are
<BR>
not the same line.  They are separated by wire shielding and air.  Even if
<BR>
two brains are &quot;in the same location&quot;, they are not in overlapping spaces.
<BR>
There is an air gap between them.  You only call these things &quot;the same
<BR>
location&quot; because your resolution is not accurate enough to detect that they
<BR>
are inches apart.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Everybody on this list received you post, it was the same message,  they
</EM><BR>
were all
<BR>
<EM>&gt; identical, you only wrote one post. But now I changed one &quot;i&quot; to a &quot;e&quot; and
</EM><BR>
so now
<BR>
<EM>&gt; they can be distinguished, there are now 2 different messages.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a semantic problem.  They are NOT the same post.  One copy might get
<BR>
deliverd, while one does not.  One copy might get corrupted while one does
<BR>
not.  The very fact that your change only affects one copy and not the
<BR>
other, indicates that they are separate.
<BR>
<P>If your server tried to bill you for having a million megs of data online,
<BR>
would you seriously argue that you only had one meg?  Or, are you seriously
<BR>
aruging that of all the data in the universe, there are really only two bits
<BR>
of information:  a one and a zero?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No. I've been making a billion Harvey Newstroms and destroying a billion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Harvey Newstroms every second and will continue to do so. How are you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any poorer for it?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not harmed at all by you creating and deleting copies of me.  The
<BR>
copies that are created are harmed when you destroy them.  The universe
<BR>
might have missed the opportunity to have a billion copies of me, since you
<BR>
created them but then destroyed them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There never was an original Harvey Newstrom, I've been doing this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a billion times every second since the day you were born. It's my hobby.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are playing fast-and-loose with defintions.  Where did you get the plan
<BR>
for building a Harvey Newstrom?  From the original.  Every copy of Harvey
<BR>
Newstrom was generated from a pre-existing copy, except for one.  There was
<BR>
once an original that was produced the old-fashioned way.
<BR>
<P>You are using word-games and semantic smoke-and-mirrors to claim that there
<BR>
was no original.  Maybe there is no difference between the original and the
<BR>
copies, I agree.  But to retroactively claim that there never was an
<BR>
original is just wrong historically.
<BR>
<P>Do you have another term you want to apply to the first copy besides
<BR>
&quot;original&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;The killed copies have died.  The last remaining copy is still alive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But the last remaining copy is only &quot;alive&quot; for 10^-9 seconds and that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far too short a time to form a complete thought, and yet you still think,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you still feel alive, you still feel that life is continuos, and you
</EM><BR>
didn't even
<BR>
<EM>&gt; know I was doing this to you until I told you. Despite the trillions you
</EM><BR>
say
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have &quot;died&quot; something lives on, your conscious continues uninterrupted.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is smoke-and-mirrors again.  If you create a body and destroy it so
<BR>
fast that it doesn't have time to have a single thought, then you have
<BR>
failed to recreate my consciousness in a copy.  You have changed the
<BR>
definition of the copy from being a functional mind copy to a nonfunctional
<BR>
body copy.  If the copy cannot think a single thought, then this is clearly
<BR>
not the thought-synchronized copy you were discussing earlier.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; A brain that was thinking thoughts and would have kept thinking
</EM><BR>
thoughts
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;if left alone has suddenly  been forced to stop thinking thoughts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;This is my definition of death.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Every time I talk to you I change you, I cause you to think thoughts you
</EM><BR>
would
<BR>
<EM>&gt; not have thought if I'd kept my mouth shut. Do I commit murder whenever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I say &quot;hello&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>You misunderstood me again.  I didn't say any change in thought equals
<BR>
death.  I said any prevention of thought equals death.  You're saying
<BR>
&quot;hello&quot; generates new thoughts, it does not prevent them.  I welcome the new
<BR>
thoughts generated when you say &quot;hello&quot;.  I avoid the lack of thoughts when
<BR>
you destroy my brain.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;        &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        &gt;&gt;I have a red tomato in my right hand and a red apple in my left
</EM><BR>
hand, but
<BR>
<EM>&gt;        &gt;&gt;I don't think the tomato is communicating with the apple telling
</EM><BR>
it how to be red.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;But you are not claiming that the tomato is the apple. Bad analogy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well actually, although my world famous, incredibly intense, completely
</EM><BR>
mind bowing
<BR>
<EM>&gt; godlike modesty makes me hesitate to say so,  I think it's a damn good
</EM><BR>
analogy.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Neither the tomato nor the apple is important, only red is important.
</EM><BR>
Neither carbon
<BR>
<EM>&gt; atoms or hydrogen atoms are important, only you and I are important.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're not going to claim that the Platonic god-form qualia of &quot;redness&quot; is
<BR>
co-existing in both fruit, are you?  Is your whole claim of duplicates being
<BR>
a single object based on quantam many-worlds, qualia, Platonic forms, mystic
<BR>
souls, or anything else that can't be defined by atoms and energy?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;Give me an anology where you claim that the objects in either hand
</EM><BR>
are the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;same object, even if they are not touching or communicating.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, I hold the number 17 in my right hand and in my left.
</EM><BR>
<P>Very good analogy.  I think this clearly defines the difference between our
<BR>
belief systems.  Clearly, you believe a person is a quality or adjective,
<BR>
and anybody displaying that quality is that quality.  Clearly, I believe
<BR>
that a person is an instance of a quality and anybody displaying that
<BR>
quality is another identical person.
<BR>
<P>Again, I don't see where we disagree on any objective facts.  We disagree on
<BR>
the philosophical ramifications of the copy experiments.  We disagree on the
<BR>
semantic terminology we should use to describe the physics.  We disagree on
<BR>
our value judgements as to which attributes are important to us and which
<BR>
attributes are unimportant.
<BR>
<P>Is this a good summary of the discussion?  I don't want to cut off
<BR>
discussion, because it is very interesting to me.  However, I would like to
<BR>
know if we are discussing differences of philosophy, beliefs, and values
<BR>
instead of physics, atoms and energy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;What theory of mine are you testing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What a copy is, what the original is, at what point one changes into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other, and most important of all your theory that it matters.
</EM><BR>
<P>It may be impossible to discuss these with you, since your definitions
<BR>
preclude the concepts.  Your terms are defined a la 1984 doublespeak, such
<BR>
that decenting opinions cannot be expressed.
<BR>
<P>You claim that two brains or files or postings containing the exact same
<BR>
data are actually the same single entity.  If this is so, how can we even
<BR>
discuss making an identical copy?  If you start out with &quot;one&quot; entity, make
<BR>
a duplicate copy, and end up with &quot;one&quot; entity, how do you know that you
<BR>
succeeded?  How do you express in your terminology that a copy has been made
<BR>
or that a duplicate even exists?
