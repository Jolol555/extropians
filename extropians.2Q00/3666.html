<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
<EM>&gt; There's so far very little evidence that the small number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who have voted for a third party candidate in a U.S.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presidential election have altered the actual policies of any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the major candidates, at least in recent times. It's altered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rhetoric to some degree, sure, but very little else.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's fair, if subjective.  I think it has mattered quite a bit:
<BR>
even as little as 12 years ago, the word &quot;libertarian&quot; was never
<BR>
heard on any media despite some small success.  Today, all reporters
<BR>
know who we are and what we stand for--even those who only use the
<BR>
word in a derogatory way.  Political internet sites are pretty
<BR>
universal in including us as well, and that would have been a lot
<BR>
harder to achieve without being able to point to real polling
<BR>
results.  It's easy for such a site to dismiss a minor candidate,
<BR>
but it's a lot harder to justify them excluding a party that's
<BR>
been on every ballot for 12 years, and with a 20-year history of
<BR>
elected officials in office across the country.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In any event, the first question about the purpose of voting is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the nature of the problem we seek to solve with our vote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is it formal, or substantive? That is, is the problem the (de
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; facto) two party system, or is the problem that there is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PARTICULAR candidate we want elected who is better than those of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either of the Big Two parties?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You seem to think it's the latter. I think it's the former. (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also think the latter is a problem; and you probably also think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the former is a problem to some degree.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly--and the two-party system is not just de facto, it is
<BR>
also quite de jure with plenty of legal barriers to ballot access
<BR>
for third parties in many states, and discriminatory funding.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In my view, the goal is 1) to elect the best of the viable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; options, with respect to particular issues that matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (stem-cell research, etc.); and, FAR more importantly, 2) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elect somone who will increase the odds that the two-party
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system will (eventually) break down, in order that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conditions for the solution to the SUBSTANTIVE problem will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finally come about.
</EM><BR>
<P>If that's possible, I can't argue with that goal--my vitriol is
<BR>
directed at those (all-too-common) reporter who think one should
<BR>
_always_ vote for a viable candidate, not those for who such a
<BR>
vote might be rational for other reasons.
<BR>
<P>Yes, I too have even voted for one of the big two on some very
<BR>
rare occasions--for example, in the last California gubernatorial
<BR>
primary (which was an open primary that everyone knew would be
<BR>
ignored by the parties) I voted for Republican candidate Dennis
<BR>
Peron, author of our medical marijuana initiative.  This was to
<BR>
send a message about what I consider the most important issue, and
<BR>
I thought that message might be better served by that vote than by
<BR>
one for my own party.  I can also imagine some very close races
<BR>
where one of the major candidates is much more tolerable than the
<BR>
other might justify using a vote to prevent a really bad choice
<BR>
from happenning.  The final governor's race was that close,
<BR>
polling as a dead heat until the last moment (but alas, both
<BR>
major candidates were so repulsive I had no preference).
<BR>
<P>But in all of those cases, I am expressing a genuine preference
<BR>
with a vote that I expect to be heard, not just blindly following
<BR>
the crowd and picking the best of the viable ones.  Worst of all
<BR>
is voting for a viable candidate when the result is already known.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  A voter who chooses to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shirk that duty by hiding his true prefence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; among a sea of conformity, despite there being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no possible benefit to him or anyone else in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doing so, is not worthy of respect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hm.... okay, well, I suppose there's little point in discussing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this further then.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you think I'm non-persuadable just because I'm vocal, you are
<BR>
mistaken.  I commit my life to my beliefs, but that doesn't mean I
<BR>
can't commit my life to different ones tomorrow if I'm persuaded by
<BR>
good arguments.
<BR>
