<P><EM>&gt; However given that many of us remember the fight against the fascists &amp; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nazis and regard those terms as carrying an extremely heavy emotional load; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't you think that calling the entire U. S. economy fascist because some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fraction of probably one percent of the entire economy voluntarily does 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business with the U. S. government rather extreme?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the best definition of facism I've seen is &quot;technical private ownership
<BR>
but actual government control&quot;, more or less Bonnie's definition. If you've
<BR>
got a better definition, let's hear it; but by that definition the US is 
<BR>
heavily
<BR>
fascist.  More precisely, the US is run on a mixture of (semidemocratic)
<BR>
fascism and capitalism; exact figure would be very hard to come by but
<BR>
both components are large.
<BR>
<P>Government rules and regulations are hardly limited to the nuclear power
<BR>
industry.  They are ubiquitous in labor relations, education, medicine
<BR>
(especially drugs!), transportion, resource use, and land development, 
<BR>
to name a number of fields which make up well over 30% (no figures; 
<BR>
that's a lowball estimate) of the economy.
