<EM>&gt; &gt; Last night I watched a chilling BBC program by a journo who infiltrated a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bunch of soccer thugs in Britain and furtively filmed their antics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; boasts. These were not stupid men, by and large. Some of them had (or once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; had) reasonably demanding jobs. They just lerrrrved smacking and bashing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the shit out of other people. Their blood was up, it boiled with rage and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; delight, they had flow and peak experience. There's going to be a lot of it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; going around, even if Banks's Culture emerges.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And please don't tell me this won't happen if everyone's packing heat (as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they used to say on the mean streets)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ummm...I *do* spend a lot of time in places where most everyone &quot;packs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heat&quot; (and where the local populations consume more than their fair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; share of alcohol I might add).  The blood does not run in the streets and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people are generally very polite in their behavior.  These people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are *very* aware of the weapon they carry and the responsibility that goes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with it.  As is often noted, the American &quot;wild west&quot; had a lower incident
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of violent crime than the not-so-wild west ever had.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your claim is frequently made, but has proven to be invalid in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; numerous cases where everyone does in fact &quot;pack heat&quot;.  I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand how this assertion can be made any more, given the large body of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence that refutes it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps populations that &quot;pack heat&quot; have more evolved level of maturity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or at least personal responsibility, than those that don't.  One thing is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for certain: broadly armed populations definitely select for these traits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Very much so. Its much like nuclear deterrence. Note the lack of World
<BR>
Wars since the creation of the atom bomb, at a time when one would
<BR>
expect such basically incompatible political systems to be slogging it
<BR>
out toe to toe on an ongoing, full bore, basis. Nukes stood them off
<BR>
until one side collapsed as a result of its own memetic unfitness in the
<BR>
marketplace. The same process will occur with the future confrontation
<BR>
between China and the US, which I predict will be a far more dangerous
<BR>
period, while at the same time, China will have a greater capacity to
<BR>
collapse if treated right.
<BR>
<P>An armed society creates an implied threat that shuts up loudmouths,
<BR>
tones down the emotionally heated, and essentially spontaneously
<BR>
organizes a polite society. Of course, there are those that think that
<BR>
their right to wantonly assault or insult anyone that annoys them
<BR>
exceeds an individuals right to defend his life, love, liberty and
<BR>
property. Such individuals do not last where there is evolution in
<BR>
action, and they clearly resent the pressure.
