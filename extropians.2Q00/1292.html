<EM>&gt; a) there is no 'thrill' or 'rush' from packing heat. Anyone who does so for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that purpose or to get the chance to use it on somebody shouldn't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; carrying, or should really reexamine why they are carrying. This is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; typical response of the hoplophobes, that people who carry are a bunch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bloodthirsty sadists that wanna go out and kick ass. This couldn't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; further from the truth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I beg to differ from personal experience.  I have known a few people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; carried concealed weapons legally after having gotten a permit, and while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definitely not looking to blow someone away, did get a certain 'rush' from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, and had a 'try to mess with me now, scumbags!' attitude that they shared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with me in private.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure there are some people who have been or felt victimized or lived in fear
<BR>
and have gotten their permits do feel at least at first, like a weight has been
<BR>
taken off their shoulders, that they can stand up straight for once. Thats a
<BR>
natural consequence of empowerment. If that doesn't fade into calm acceptance of
<BR>
the added responsibility that the freedom to carry is, they they have some
<BR>
issues to work out. What I understood you meant by a  rush is the 'hoo-raw, lets
<BR>
go find some perps to wax' kind of swat/marine attitude. Thats really
<BR>
unacceptable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Fortunately, they had gone through a class that taught them well to think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; twice before pulling the gun out.  The full ramifications had been explained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in detail.  And they were basically sound individuals who just did not want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be threatened by punks.
</EM><BR>
<P>As any free person should be able to do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; you continue:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; b) in a society where everyone took such responsibility for themselves, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't need to go at it alone. There would be a good couple dozen other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; responsible citizens right there along with you. In such a society, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be no such thing as a 'dangerous area'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike, remember the wild west??  Even if everyone carried today, there would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly still be dangerous areas because of the nature of the local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; populations and the gangs there!  But if you went there with your 'posse' of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; friends and not alone you would have a decent chance of surviving because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 'bad guys' would not want to risk their lives with such odds.
</EM><BR>
<P>As James Rogers said, the wild west was actually not so wild. Outside of a few
<BR>
events like the OK Corral shooting, which were touted and sensationalized by a
<BR>
very bored and sleepy press looking for stories to publish and glamorize, there
<BR>
was little violence outside of the occasional conflict with recalictrant
<BR>
natives, etc. Keep in mind that Dodge City Oklahoma, Tombstone Arizona, and Fort
<BR>
Sumner New Mexico were all towns that did not permit the carrying of guns within
<BR>
city limits, so these 'hotbeds' of western violence were actually the Chicago,
<BR>
New York, LA, and DC's of their day crime and gun control wise.
