<P><EM>&gt; (((&gt;H connection more than strenuous, but sounds like good advice)))
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we are seeing here another application of the transhumanist
<BR>
approach to living. We want to live consciously designed lives, where
<BR>
we question the common assumptions about what and how things should be
<BR>
done. 
<BR>
<P>As for myself, I seem to be living like this lifestyle too. I started
<BR>
living rather frugal during my studies simply due to lack of money,
<BR>
and when I got a salary I almost did not know what to do with the
<BR>
money.  I could afford a larger flat than my current one room, but I
<BR>
don't *need* it and have no problems (except for where to put my book
<BR>
piles). By not having expensive hobbies and vices I get a lot of spare
<BR>
money to invest or spend on worthwhile stuff like books, good food,
<BR>
computers and going to transhumanist conferences.
<BR>
<P>There is a difference between materialism and consumerism. A
<BR>
materialist enjoys the material world (not necessarily exclusively; I
<BR>
regard myself as a materialist in this sense but I value intangibles
<BR>
like knowledge and information even higher), a consumerist follows a
<BR>
pattern of behavior imprinted from the surrounding culture. I think
<BR>
that to reach true transhumanist materialism you have to get rid of
<BR>
consumerism and find what *you* value the most, be it good service,
<BR>
food, design, state of the art equipment or anything else.
