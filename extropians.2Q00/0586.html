What do you think about (computer) networking the entire community? If the 
<BR>
proper provisions were made during the planning phases of residential 
<BR>
construction, future implementation would be less complicated and more 
<BR>
cost-effective, especially considering the potential returns. Using this 
<BR>
backbone, community members would not only have the perks of high speed 
<BR>
Internet connection, (which is becoming an increasingly important 
<BR>
consideration for prospective residents these days - for me, it was my 
<BR>
PRIMARY concern when choosing an apartment :-) ) but one might also be able 
<BR>
to use this as a basis for the implementation of a large-scale 
<BR>
bio-statistics monitoring network, or something of that nature. I'm not 
<BR>
really certain how people would react to this latter idea, but I imagine it 
<BR>
could be done.

<P>I will have to pass your excellent suggestions on to David Pizer.  I
<BR>
am not sure to the extent he plans on having an internet connection 
<BR>
infrastructure set up.  David has mentioned that he wants a large-scale 
<BR>
bio-monitoring network set up in the later stages of the project.  
<BR>
Ironically, you could have people dying and being left to decay in the 
<BR>
middle of a cryonics enclave, if you didn't have such a system implemented!
<BR>
