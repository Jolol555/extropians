<EM>&gt; &quot; [Fredkin] estimated the total amount of computation going on in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universe, producing, ironically, a figure that seems puzzlingly low. He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calls this the problem of the missing workload. Essentially what he has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done is calculate how large a cellular automation would need to be to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simulate the entire universe in all its details.  The answer, he argues,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that the CA that operated at the tiniest quantum scales known as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Plank length and Plank time would only need to be not much larger than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a bigish star to faithfully simulate the entire macroscopic evolution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of our universe from the Big Bang to the present in about 4 hours. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference in space time volume between the universe and such a system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a factor of 10^63.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's true, most of the universe is empty space.  It doesn't do much
<BR>
most of the time except propagate some wave/particles from one side to
<BR>
the other.  It's a pretty low level computation compared to what it
<BR>
could be doing.
<BR>
<P>I'll bet Fredkin didn't estimate the calculation if we assume that the
<BR>
many-worlds theory is true and the universe is really a &quot;multiverse&quot;.
<BR>
He is just calculating what it takes to do our branch of the multiverse.
<BR>
In reality (in this theory) the totality of the universe is enormously
<BR>
larger.
<BR>
<P>Still though I don't think there is any reason a priori to expect that
<BR>
the universe will be tightly packed with computations.  There isn't
<BR>
necessarily anything about this that has to be explained.
<BR>
<P>One of the approaches I like is to suppose that the universe is that
<BR>
which minimizes the information content needed to describe it, subject to
<BR>
the constraint that intelligence exist.  It could well be that spreading
<BR>
things out in space and time produces a simpler description than packing
<BR>
them together.
