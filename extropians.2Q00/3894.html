<EM>&gt; &gt;It's sad that Rand wasted such a brilliant mind on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;such a defeatist, &quot;mental-masturbatory&quot; philosophy...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and, before I get flamed for that statement, I realize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;we all share her ideals of independence.  Nonetheless,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as one who has studied her work thoroughly, I feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;confident (though, granted, not infallible) in saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that she turned a golden ideal into an empty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;rhetoric...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I won't flame you, but I will disagree.  Despite the direction Peikoff has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taken the Objectivist Institute in recent years,
</EM><BR>
<P>Correction: Peikoff is with the Ayn Rand Institute.  The Institute for
<BR>
Objectivist Studies is its rival and has been renamed The Objectivist
<BR>
Center.
<BR>
<P>Peikoff's stance has always been -- not just in recent years -- very
<BR>
orthodox and inflexible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; philosophical Objectivism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still has merit.  Very few who have been influenced by Rand's philosophy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have revoked that influence...most still try to attain the ideal.  I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; often suggested that Extropy is the next logical step to Objectivism:
</EM><BR>
using
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the acknowledgment of individual ability proferred by Rand's philosophy
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; uniting it with a focus on future progress.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd like to see how this is so, especially given the deeper aspects of
<BR>
Objectivism's view of man and ethics.  I think there is a lot to be gained
<BR>
from studying both views, though I do think there are some differences.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I will agree that her personal life (as cited in her biographies) did not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always match her philosophical offerings, but I would be hard pressed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that any of her ideals (or those in her books) can be considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rhetoric.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would say they are rhetoric, but not empty rhetoric.  I agree that Rand's
<BR>
life and the life of her followers (especially the soulless ones:) should
<BR>
not be used as an indictment of Objectivism as a philosophy.  That would be
<BR>
nothing more than a simple ad hominem attack.  (And even flawed people can
<BR>
be right.)
<BR>
<P>See my site for some of my criticisms/refinements of Objectivism.
<BR>
<P>Later!
