<EM>&gt; &gt; Basically, Michael is wrong on _every_ count he cites. But he's right in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; his overall assertion that the UK (or at least England/Wales, a distinct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; legal entity from Scotland or Northern Ireland) is not free.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm so right I'm wrong, I guess?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property crime high.... check
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did SAS kill dissidents? ... check  (that they aren't killing them ANYMORE is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irrelevant, only because everyone is now playing nice nice. When the next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dissident group shows up will prove if its a true change)
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahem: if we play this game, I'll have to cite the CIA's fun activities
<BR>
in the 1960's and 1970's. Or Oliver North's little escapades. Clue: the
<BR>
&quot;next dissident group&quot; is _already_ planting bombs -- it's nothing to
<BR>
do with the Irish issue and everything to do with militant animal rights
<BR>
protestors blowing up meat packing warehouses.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You say the income tax is lower? What are the brackets, the percentages? What are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the deductions? What is the cost of living?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, speaking as a non-accountant, I'm in the top income tax bracket -- 
<BR>
paying 40% on taxable income about 28K (pounds, not dollars). I don't have
<BR>
any recent figures to hand, but the last ones I saw suggested that the
<BR>
gross proportion of income we pay in tax here is about 39%, compared with
<BR>
38% in the USA and &gt;40% anywhere else in the EU. (Sweden, with the highest
<BR>
rate, was around 55%.)
<BR>
<P>One problem in the UK is the cosy marketing cartels. For example, automobiles
<BR>
cost a LOT more here than elsewhere -- not because they're rare or because
<BR>
they're heavily taxed, but because the UK is a captive market. Right hand
<BR>
drive vehicles, right? Makes it a bit hard to hop over the channel and buy
<BR>
one. So the manufacturers all sell via a nice cosy dealership arrangement
<BR>
that sees the same model selling for 30-40% more in the UK. (This particular
<BR>
example is now collapsing under the weight of anti-trust investigations and
<BR>
e-commerce entrepreneurs handling imports, and the dealerships are screaming
<BR>
blue murder, but it indicates a pattern underlying the cost of living in the
<BR>
UK -- which is high, but not necessarily because of taxation.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;you saying you don't have the right to refuse to participate in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the health care system and the social security system?
</EM><BR>
<P>Do _you_ have the right to health care or social security if you refuse to
<BR>
pay for them?
<BR>
<P>I have the right to refuse to use them.  But they're there. And they
<BR>
represent a _lot_ of personal insurance premiums I'd be paying if they
<BR>
weren't, and a lot of surplus value going into a fat, parasitic insurance
<BR>
industry.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;       ..... And the UK has been becoming increasingly, radically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; diverse since the end of the 1950's.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Its still lily white compared to the US.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Still into the one-upmanship?
<BR>
<P>These days, the UK is approximately 7% non-white. Yeah, that's lilly
<BR>
white compared to the US. It is, however, a major departure from the
<BR>
historical record.
