Very powerful rant!  I couln't agree more!  What does GTI stand for?

<EM> &gt; &gt;To be honest, I feel that the atheists who get pissed-off, under these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;generally, friendly circumstances of email exchanges, must feel challenged
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;anyone who is not an atheist.   I cannot imagine why, if this is true?  If
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;am foolish enough to believe in God and you don't;  how does that adversely
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;effect you?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I'm sure the precise source of the hostility for each individual is similar,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; but not identical to my feelings on the matter. See, growing up as a wee
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; fresh new human, we gaze up at these &quot;grown-ups&quot; with awe - completely
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; confident that they know everything about everything, and you will inherit
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; this knowledge when you &quot;mature/grow up&quot;. Later, when you find out that in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; fact, given the time that humans have been around, they've done pretty much
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; jack, except devise various ways of making a few persons comfortable at the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; expense of the many, and that they also know precisely squat about the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; universe, existence and everything. And instead of trying to find these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; answers, the vast, vast majority just &quot;believe&quot; in some moronic fairy tale
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to dull their nagging curiosity/fear. Not only that, but you find out that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; as a child, you were in many ways superior to the exhalted grown-ups, who
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; are really no different save some limited experience, and much less freedom
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in terms of motivation - (must have sex, must acquire resources, must
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; further my social status blah blah...).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Basically, it turns out that humans are lizard GTI, and that virtually
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; nobody has any interest whatsoever in matters beside those directly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; applicable to the animal. I have become what they claimed to be - and now I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; find myself alone. From this perspective, try and imagine how grating the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; zealous rant of the religious really is, when they have the potential for so
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; much more.
