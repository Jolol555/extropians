<EM>&gt; &gt; What's Tagging?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike, the fact that you don't know what tagging is may shine some light on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why you and I have a totally different world view. You are sheltered, boy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its funny that the gang bangers don't have the cojones to move into communities
<BR>
that WILL shoot back...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Tagging of course, is the gang names painted on (usually) city walls (though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in beautiful nearby Vasquez rock you still see it). It is similar to the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dogs mark their territory. If a gang tags a particular street or neighborhood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it means &quot;watch out his is ours&quot;. People her in Lovely LAPD land are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sometimes even shot on sight for this, but they do it anyway. Shootouts with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the police are common, as well as other gangs who's name you are spraying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over. It's more than vandalism, it signifies a whole way of life. It is one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the dumbest things a person can do, but it takes big BIG cohones; hence it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is respected by street fighters.
</EM><BR>
<P>It does go on occasionally up here, its just such a pathetically weak thing to do
<BR>
though, and not at all different from any other kind of vandalism. If you are
<BR>
going to spray paint on something, at least do it with a message. Its doesn't
<BR>
take any cojones to do it up here either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I could give a shit about fur coats.  Most people who feel the need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; procalim &quot;meat is murder&quot; really could look into helping peolpe instead. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't think they're animal lovers as much as people -haters; ). They want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pulbcity. No on e watching, what would be the point? Plus throwing red paint
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at a rich bitch isnt really such a big crime, it's just more vandalism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  IMHO OK Bad behaviors when nobody is watching or around:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  speeding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  catch &amp; not release
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  running red lights &amp; stop signs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  streaking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  outdoors sex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  billboard sabotage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  foodfights at MacDonalds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  One of my favorites:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Back in college, when someone passed out at our frat house, a group of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  'food' them, which entailed moving them to the banquet table, and dressing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  up with various foods from the kitchen such that they looked like a buffet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  spread.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ok Mike,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Except for catch and not release ( which is more archaic than anything else),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running red lights which could get you killed accidentally,
</EM><BR>
<P>not with my caveat 'nobody is around'. If there is no traffic, then what is the
<BR>
point?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and Billboard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sabotage, (which sounds suspiciously a lot like tagging...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...what is 'bad' about any of those things? They sound harmless, and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propbably like it if people *are* watching... ; - ) ; ) : )
</EM><BR>
<P>Sabotaging billboards with a message. I especially like the work the Bay Area's
<BR>
Billboard Liberation Front has done, especially the conversion of the Joe Camel
<BR>
billboard to  &quot;Am I Dead Yet?&quot;. Another great vandalism was to the &quot;Hammering
<BR>
Man&quot; scuplture in front of the Seattle Art Museum. This sculpture is about 50'
<BR>
tall, and has one arm of the man continuously going up and down with a hammer in
<BR>
it, signifying the dignity of all labor. A group of Seattle artists vandalized it
<BR>
a few years ago though, they clamped a big ball and chain to the leg of the
<BR>
statue.
<BR>
<P>This sort of vandalism is, IMHO, 'good' vandalism. I don't even necessarily need
<BR>
to agree with the message that the vandals want to get across. Its a matter of
<BR>
adding to pubic discourse messages that the corporate media don't allow unless
<BR>
you do something outrageous. Sasha and I used to talk about ideas like this, it
<BR>
was his opinion that terrorists would get much farther in the political process
<BR>
if they engaged in non-violent propa-vandalism like this. One thing he wanted to
<BR>
do was stink bomb a political convention...
