<P>That wouldnt last long at all.  The female children would become quite

valuable as soon as there became even a small deficit.

<P>I would truly *like* to see Afghanistan get the technology and produce
<BR>
a generation with only 10% female.  That would change things, would
<BR>
it not?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The short term, social effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of this would be bad. I'd expect to see an intensification of attitudes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which treat women as property.
</EM><BR>
<P>Disagree.  Those 10% women would be able to have aaaaaanything
<BR>
they wanted.  They would run the show.  I hear the few women who were
<BR>
in the American west in the early days were treated quite respectably.
