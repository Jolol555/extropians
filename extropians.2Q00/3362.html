<EM>&gt; The question nobody wants to answer clearly because is would just

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Question: I've been making and destroying a billion Harvey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Newstroms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every second since you were a one celled zygote, so who is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; original
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Harvey Newstrom?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I know why you've been hesitating and maybe I'm a little sadistic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for pushing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  so hard but I want to see if you can really say with a straight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; face that the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  true original is that one celled zygote.
</EM><BR>
<P>Pardon me for butting in, but in one sense the original IS the
<BR>
one-celled zygote, period. If you don't like this, I assume it is
<BR>
because you don't accept the zygote as being &quot;Harvey&quot; (or an adumbral
<BR>
stage thereof).
<BR>
<P>I assume this is because you (reasonably) value the sense of
<BR>
identity, and don't believe that the zygote would be capable of this.
<BR>
<P>BUT the said zygote would (if it were lucky) grow up to be a 
<BR>
conscious Harvey. It would have a continuous space-time line going
<BR>
back to when it was that *first zygote* that you began copying. The
<BR>
continuity of the space-time line seems to me to be the only
<BR>
reasonable standard.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; All human beings who are not in a coma have a sense of identity, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the reason we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fear death is we fear it will be lost and it's the only part of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's important. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The copies may well have consciousness and continiuty of *memories*
<BR>
with the original they came from, and value their sense of
<BR>
identity/consciousness, and good luck to them. 
<BR>
<P>This still doesn't mean that they ARE the original. 
<BR>
<P>[...]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I might add that my thought experiment is not really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that far fetched,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every second trillions of atoms leave out body and trillions more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take their place.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Yes but the pattern of the ensemble is reasonably constant, (and the
<BR>
majority of atoms will remain at each stage for what it's worth) and
<BR>
the ensemble will have a continous space-time line. I don't think
<BR>
this is the same as making a copy (with the same number of EXTRA,
<BR>
atoms) in another place.
