<P><EM>&gt;&gt;We too have public hospitals, Cook County hospital scene of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Chicago Hope being perhaps the most famous example.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;You don't need insurance or a nickel to your name to be treated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;there, but you have to wait, wait alot, and fill out reams of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;paperwork.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;And that's what all the fuss is about.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Interesting, but that doesn't quite explain Bonnie's sad tale:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;I've had to drink gallons of water to get rid of a bladder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;infection, because I couldn't afford to go to a doctor and get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;antibiotics. I know what it's like to take a risk.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know why Bonnie didn't pursue other options at that time,
<BR>
I merely pointed out that there are other options here.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Couldn't happen in Australia. And you wouldn't need to wait long,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or fill in *any* paperwork - just a local doctor, and a signature.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Major treatment would require a trip to the hospital, of course,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and attendant tedium. But there's nothing stopping people here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from buying insurance and getting swifter treatment.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I've had a taste of socialized medicine (U.S. Military).... no
<BR>
thanks.
<BR>
<P>If all went to hell, I have the second option of getting treatment
<BR>
at a VA hospital being a Vietnam-Era Vet, but I have private
<BR>
insurance negotiated as part of a Union benefits package.
<BR>
<P>I know people who live in giant houses, with summer homes, and 2
<BR>
SUV's who take 2 or more extended vacations a year, and have kids
<BR>
in private schools, who complain that they can't afford health
<BR>
insurance.
<BR>
<P>The same people turn up their snooty little noses at the idea of
<BR>
being a member of a Union.
<BR>
<P>To hell with them.
