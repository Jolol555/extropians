<EM>&gt; I know zilch abt all this, but what happens if &amp; when (a) the insurance

<EM>&gt; companies realise that medical/genomic/nanomed improvements in healthy

<EM>&gt; longevity are adding together into a lifespan revolution (on the face of it

<P>Well, there is always a basis for insurance against accidents, but in
<BR>
general I would agree that people will reduce life insurance as they
<BR>
see medical technologies able to repair or reverse most causes of
<BR>
death.  However(!), you might get people being insured for a lot more
<BR>
&quot;semi-elective&quot; health insurance.  You want to pay for the preventative
<BR>
maintenance, latest health monitors, organs-pre-grown-and-cryoed, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the whole customer base for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insurance industry collapses around the same time revival becomes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technically feasible - since both are constrained/enabled by the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; factors - then the cryo warehouse customers will be shit out of luck right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they need it most. No?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so.  When you are &quot;legally&quot; dead, the funds (from term
<BR>
or whole life) go from the InsCo to the CryoOrg.  Now, I would hope
<BR>
they don't put it back into any insurance managed fund.  Perhaps
<BR>
a market index fund would be the best approach.  You could probably
<BR>
review the cryo orgs funding approaches online if you look around a bit.
<BR>
Most people think their friends and family are going to pay for
<BR>
the revival costs.  The other alternative is to put something
<BR>
additional away to pay for the reanimation.
<BR>
<P>What *will* be interesting is what happens to the value of all those
<BR>
InsCo investments in skyscrapers, when nanotech (or even widespread
<BR>
optical fiber) makes city-centers obsolete (as is documented in
<BR>
Egan's Distress).  I think most InsCo's are starting to get the
<BR>
hint and are shifting away from hard assets into stock assets
<BR>
because the ROIs have been so much better over the last 10-15 years.
<BR>
<P>The really interesting part of the Singularity/Spike will be the
<BR>
equity shifts *required* to maintain any wealth.  You have to dump
<BR>
any assets where the valuation is based on &quot;mass&quot; assets or
<BR>
infrastructure, and move it quickly into software/bio/nano
<BR>
development companies.
<BR>
<P>Gotta be nimble, gotta be quick, oh lord, how can you tell
<BR>
that you made the right pick.
