<EM>&gt;   violence and mass slaughter.

<EM>&gt;   these in a terrorist capacity, one has usually moved beyond terrorist

<EM>&gt;   tactics and onto tactics that actually accomplish whatever ends were

<EM>&gt;   acknolwedges no solution except death to one's enemies, for instance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   with the Iraqi weapons labs.)

<P>You may or may not have all the details right, but I think you're on the
<BR>
right track.  For some reason, the mindset of the terrorist (or the mad
<BR>
bomber) seems to be incompatible with the mindset required to become an
<BR>
expert in nuclear, biological or chemical weapons.  AFAIK the rare
<BR>
exceptions to this rule all involve chemical weapons, which are by far the
<BR>
easiest of the three types to make.
<BR>
<P>All of which makes me a little less paranoid about abuse of nanotech than I
<BR>
otherwise would be.  Not happy, mind you - I'd much rather find real
<BR>
defenses than rely on this kind of guesswork - but at least we have
<BR>
something of a backup defense if we get unlucky enough to need it.
