<P><EM>&gt;When privacy has no value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It will be a boon to all the pedophiles lurking about.. santaclause even 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sees you when your sleeping.. He knows when your awake..&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't foresee transparency getting to the point that it is legal for dirty 
<BR>
old men to leer at people while they are in various states of undress within 
<BR>
the privacy of their own homes.  Perverts will be perverts, but I can't see 
<BR>
their behavior ever getting the sanction of law.
<BR>
<P>Sure, once tiny and powerful surveillance technology is in the hands of the 
<BR>
masses we will all be vulnerable to the inquisitive and prurient interests 
<BR>
of our neighbors.  But the same tech that threatens us will also be there to 
<BR>
protect us.  It is, of course, a double edged sword.  So you watched me 
<BR>
lounging in the nude last night?  Well guess what?  Someone watched you, 
<BR>
watching me and now *you're* going to jail.  Nyah, nyah.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Wow nasty double masectomy scars your mother has.. can't she afford breast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reconstruction?
</EM><BR>
<P>See above.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Good morning  Jim.. we all saw you materbating on camera last night.. and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this is not good for our corporate image, your terminated.
</EM><BR>
<P>1.  You broke the law by spying on me while I was, er, &quot;massaging&quot; myself.  
<BR>
2.  Firing me for doing things on my own time which are not illegal is 
<BR>
against the law.  So now, I will wait til the $billion IPO and sue the 
<BR>
bejesus out of the company for invasion of privacy, wrongful termination, 
<BR>
intentional infliction of emotional distress and any number of federal civil 
<BR>
rights violations and...job?  I don't need no stinkin' job!  Thanks a bunch 
<BR>
boss!!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Hey George.. we should have Insta-patented that idea we discused last night
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;over a few beers.. Suzie has just stolen the whole deal.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah Bob, but good thing for us our whole conversation was recorded, as well 
<BR>
as the fact that Suzie was listening in.  All we have to do is submit this 
<BR>
data to the Patent Office and her patent never gets issued.  Or better yet, 
<BR>
we could just sit back and see if the idea actually works.  If so, we just 
<BR>
wait til the $billion IPO and sue the bejesus out of her for interference 
<BR>
with prospective business advantage, unfair competition, misappropriation of 
<BR>
trade secrets, commercial espionage and...idea?  We don't need no stinkin' 
<BR>
idea!  Thanks a bunch Suzie!!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Knock Knock. hello!!! We noticed YOU use this non biodegradable tampon..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;please have a free sample of our green friendly tampon !
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey thanks!  It's free *and* green?  Just what I was looking for.  I'm 
<BR>
really glad you were able to anticipate my needs like that!  Sure beats the 
<BR>
days when I had to go the the market and hunt up and down the aisle for just 
<BR>
the right kind of widget.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Damnit I'm sick of never getting a &quot;date&quot; because my penis is too small..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Why cant they get to know me first!
</EM><BR>
<P>Would you really be interested in someone who would not date you because of 
<BR>
that?  Would you really be interested in someone who would *break the law* 
<BR>
and violate your privacy to find that out about you?  If you are that 
<BR>
desperate, chances are you would never get a date no matter how big you are.
<BR>
