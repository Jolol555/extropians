<EM>&gt; &gt; Bull. a) resources are only as limited as the inefficiencies of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; socialist governments make them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Last I heard, resources were limited.
</EM><BR>
<P>What does limited mean? Practical unlimited resources mean that the
<BR>
resource utilization efficiency provided by present day technology
<BR>
causes the supply of a resource to exceed demand, forcing suppliers to
<BR>
participate in a commodity market. For example, the retrofit kit I
<BR>
invented for exit signs reduced power demands of those signs from 40
<BR>
watts down to 1/3 of one watt. If all lighting products attained such
<BR>
efficiency in short order, then there would be a huge surplus of energy
<BR>
supply, prices would drop, and producers would have to purposely
<BR>
restrain their production to try to bring prices back up. So long as
<BR>
efficiencies increase over time, they cannot ever return to the previous
<BR>
monopoly/oligopoly price points.
<BR>
<P>There is no shortage of food. A person in the US today can eat their
<BR>
full Recommended Daily Allowance of all nutrients for less than $5.00.
<BR>
There is no reason a person should suffer from malnutrition or
<BR>
starvation unless it is intentionally. What I do see in behaviors in
<BR>
homeless people is that they spend their money on luxury items:
<BR>
espresso, booze, drugs, cigarettes, etc. These are intentional choices.
<BR>
They can choose to drop bad habits (been there, done that, so don't cry
<BR>
to me how hard it is).
<BR>
<P>For those that think I'm talking out of my ass, I was homeless once too,
<BR>
back in 1991 before I started my lighting business. I knew where every
<BR>
place there was in Seattle to get stuff for free or little money, where
<BR>
to get daily cash jobs, etc. One of the most interesting things was the
<BR>
daily bag lunch. There was this charitable group that would give out bag
<BR>
lunches in front of the federal building every other day in Seattle. I
<BR>
found it to be rather insidious programming to have the handout in front
<BR>
of the federal building, a subliminal reinforcement of the idea that big
<BR>
government was the solution to all your problems...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; b) current production efficiency and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; capacity here in the US are such that every person could live quite a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nice life. As it is, only about a third of the population or so actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; works.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And yet many live in (abject) poverty; this supports your position?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, as it is, a third of the population supports the other two thirds
<BR>
(kids, retirees, disabled, homemakers, etc.) Many live in abject poverty
<BR>
because they made the choices that excluded them from the market
<BR>
economy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; c) food production, with spoilage, would provide a 3500 calorie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; diet to every person on earth if the socialist governments got out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the way and let their people acheive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We are talking about the planet Earth, yes? The food's already available;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's just that some people have it (more than they need), and some don't.
</EM><BR>
<P>No. Some people have it, and want to sell it so they can pay off their
<BR>
cost to produce and distribute the food, and pay for their own labor in
<BR>
producing and distributing it. If the producers and distributors go
<BR>
bankrupt, then there really will be not enough food.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There should be made a further distinction here between forms of socialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; World System theory makes a rough (maybe quite distinct) division between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countries in what it calls the Capitalist World System. The two types are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Core and Peripheral countries (there are also in-between countries termed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Semi-periphery, but that's not so important here).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Core countries are the wealthy capitalist countries, where industry is,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where the wealth is. The Peripheral countries are the poor countries (the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; third world), where industry and wealth is not. There is a history of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; centuries of the core countries of the world dragging natural resources out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the periphery, and using them internally; wealth moves out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; periphery and into the core.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The distinction between forms of socialism then is between core country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socialism (really semi-periphery, since socialist countries are not part of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the capitalist core) and socialism in the periphery - basically, between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eastern-european socialism and third world socialism (I'm not sure where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; China fits in here).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many third world countries may call themselves socialist, but are just your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; common or garden tyrranies when you get down to it. Similarly there is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea of substantive and formal democracy; throughout the third world you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find countries which call themselves democratic (and capitalist), but are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing more than military dictatorships. I would suggest calling both forms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of political/economic system simply dictatorships, because that's how they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is, in fact a hyrbid called mercantilist socialism, where the
<BR>
oligarchs in a country control the leadership, use the government to
<BR>
externalize their business costs onto the population, while packaging
<BR>
those externizations as 'socialist reforms' Most european countries, the
<BR>
US, and many smaller countries actually use this system, but call
<BR>
themselves other things for propaganda purposes. Just as many communists
<BR>
claim that true communism has never been done, true capitalism, which
<BR>
was once the primary economic system of the early US, currently only
<BR>
exists on the local level here in many areas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So back to the point above... when you talk about socialist governments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;getting in the way&quot;, there is a large class of countries, mostly poor, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call themselves socialist but are nothing of the sort; they should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; treated seperately in any argument re the above.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, there is much to discuss regarding third world, or peripheral,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countries, and their utter exploitation by multinationals and foreign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governments wielding massive amounts of foreign capital (&amp; foreign debt). It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the modern colonialism. It involves the core stripping the wealth from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the periphery, it renders their economies massively impoverished in the long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; term, and it means that &quot;if the socialist governments got out of the way and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; let their people acheive&quot;, the result would be sweet f*ck all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Note that peripheral countries cannot opt out of this lock, or fight their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way out; when they try to opt out, they usually go socialist (capitalism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we'rnt treetin em so gud) and are reviled and economically sanctioned by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; core, sometimes attacked; when they try to fight their way out, they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; squashed like puny bugs by certain &quot;world police&quot; that shall remain nameless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is apparently NOT the case, considering that most countries
<BR>
economically peripheral to the US are socialist, and we don't squash
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; NOTE: starvation only happens in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; socialist and econimically authoritarian countries.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo the pain hoo hoo hoo hoo oh I forgot, america has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dumpsters where you can put the spoiling food from the supermarkets
</EM><BR>
<P>The only people that eat out of dumpsters are those that pointedly
<BR>
refuse to participate in the market, due to mental or other personal
<BR>
problems. There are plenty of private charitable organizations that will
<BR>
feed anyone who comes to their door.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Demanding that a small minority do all the productive work, confiscating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; half their production as 'taxes', so a majority can live in sloth is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what is really greedy and inconsiderate. Its modern slavery.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So quit your job and bludge. Go on. Better to die on your feet than to live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on your knees, and all that stuff.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since I'm self employed, I'm pretty close. Because I can expense many
<BR>
things that an employee cannot, my taxable income is extremely small.
<BR>
Once I get my banking done offshore, then I should be home free.
