<EM>&gt;&gt; The choice is not difficult at all if you don't fall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; for the idiotic and dangerous idea that you have to vote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; for someone with a chance of winning.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The choice is indeed very difficult, if you don't fall for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idiotic and dangerous idea that voting for someone with no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chance of winning achieves anything positive.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm.  A vote is an expression of preference.  If I choose to
<BR>
express my preference for a minority candidate, that preference
<BR>
is duly recorded and reported, and the total of these votes may
<BR>
well influence the particular positions of major candidates in
<BR>
the future.  I would consider this a &quot;positive&quot; result, while
<BR>
I would consider no one ever hearing my real opinions because I
<BR>
chose to lie about them to be one of the unheard masses who
<BR>
voted for a popular candidate to be a &quot;negative&quot; result.  Do
<BR>
you have a different evaluation of those outcomes?
<BR>
<P>It is contrary to the goals of the voting process to suggest
<BR>
that one should deliberately lie about one's preference.  What
<BR>
is the benefit of voting for a winner?  Do I win something?
<BR>
Money?  Bragging rights?  No, I win a shitty government.  A
<BR>
vote is a moral duty because it affects how an agency of force
<BR>
chooses to exercise that force against the people.  A voter
<BR>
who chooses to shirk that duty by hiding his true prefence
<BR>
among a sea of conformity, despite there being no possible
<BR>
benefit to him or anyone else in doing so, is not worthy of
<BR>
respect.
<BR>
<P>Some things (like death, slavery, censorship, and mindless
<BR>
conformity to them) are so utterly contemptible that insults are
<BR>
the only honest form of expression about them.  I hear reporters
<BR>
use the &quot;wasted vote&quot; epithet many times, and I feel revulsion.
<BR>
Those people are enemies of freedom, and it is my moral duty to
<BR>
fight them and their dangerous ideas.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
