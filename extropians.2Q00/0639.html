<EM>&gt; Actually, if there were 13 months of 28 days each,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that makes 364 days a year. It would take almost a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; century for your birthday to change seasons. Isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that close enough? And the 13th month could be named
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Smithember&quot;, because I thought of it! Yeah! And all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you people who were born on the 29th, 30th, or 31st
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would just be out of luck, no birthdays for you...
</EM><BR>
<P>I've seen this proposed (non-seriously) more than once, in various
<BR>
places.  Sometimes the main desire is to keep the months more stable;
<BR>
sometimes it's just a wish for a break from the past little enough for
<BR>
most people to accept (say, doing away with the month names in favor of
<BR>
A-M; fill in your personal historic heros for the actual names).
<BR>
<P>It might have benefits, arguably...but I can't see any way in which the
<BR>
benefits of switching would overcome the cost of conversion in any
<BR>
timespan that the people one would have to sell this to could personally
<BR>
relate to.  (Maybe once life extension gives people enough perspective
<BR>
that average personal horizons start becoming more than a year, or even
<BR>
a month...)
