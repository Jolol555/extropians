<EM>&gt; Now I know that many people with physical science expertize are

<EM>&gt; expertize.  But such people are just wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>Robin, I'm curious as to how social science views the decline in
<BR>
birth rates that is expected to lead to balanced or declining
<BR>
populations in &quot;developed&quot; countries in the not-to-distant
<BR>
future?  Is there any &quot;law&quot; of social science that says
<BR>
individuals must always reproduce?  Is there any reason
<BR>
they could not self-impose a completely balanced population
<BR>
policy?  I.e. you only self-reproduce or engineer another
<BR>
when an existing entity de-materializes?  If you assume that
<BR>
there are diminishing returns to expanding (due to increasing
<BR>
delays in thought times) and increasingly diminishing returns
<BR>
to reproducing endlessly (because most of the interesting 
<BR>
combinations have already been tried and you have to think
<BR>
more and more to come up with interesting things to create),
<BR>
then it would appear that though you may have ever-growth, it
<BR>
may occur at increasingly slower rates over time.  It may
<BR>
become so slow that it becomes almost unnoticable on the scale
<BR>
of billions of years.
<BR>
<P>I think &quot;social&quot; science only works at scales that are not
<BR>
at the largest and smallest limits.  Current economic growth
<BR>
seems to be driven largely on the fact that we are currently
<BR>
colonizing &quot;smaller&quot; scales of construction.  Past economic
<BR>
growth has relied on colonization of &quot;larger&quot; scales (e.g.
<BR>
the &quot;new&quot; world).  One could argue you also get growth by
<BR>
making things more &quot;efficient&quot; -- but what if there are
<BR>
hard limits to &quot;efficiency&quot;?  If you have arguments or sources
<BR>
that discuss how social science operates when it *knows*
<BR>
it is at the scale or efficiency limits, I would be interested
<BR>
in reviewing them.
