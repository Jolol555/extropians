<P><EM>&gt; EXACTLY!  The whole copy question is a semantic problem.  There is no right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or wrong answer.  The question of self-identity is a semantic question of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terminology.  There is no right or wrong answer.  It is a question of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-value and what portion of oneself one desires to preserve under one's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own name.  How can anyone argue that one such choice is &quot;right&quot; and one such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choice is &quot;wrong&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, but I think you can still ask some meaningful questions about
<BR>
which forms of behavior will come to predominate.
<BR>
<P>It's not right or wrong to try to preserve yourself.  It's not right or
<BR>
wrong to want to reproduce.  It's not right or wrong to sacrifice yourself
<BR>
in order that close relatives who share many of your genes may survive.
<BR>
<P>Yet we can predict that all of these behaviors will become common because
<BR>
they all share the property of favoring the spread of the genes of the
<BR>
organisms who act this way.
<BR>
<P>Similarly, we can predict that memes which favor reproduction will spread
<BR>
as well.  It will come to be viewed as &quot;right&quot; to duplicate your own mind.
<BR>
It will come to be viewed as &quot;right&quot; for one mind to die if enough copies
<BR>
of it can live.  It will come to be viewed as &quot;right&quot; to make copies of
<BR>
your mind in different substrates and different forms.
<BR>
<P>All of these behaviors will be viewed as &quot;right&quot; because they all favor
<BR>
the spread of minds which adopt them.  Minds which see such actions as
<BR>
&quot;right&quot; will become numerically dominant, just as organisms which try
<BR>
to reproduce and preserve themselves are dominant today.
