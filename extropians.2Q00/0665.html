<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; The ABA is a government supported monopoly.  Without the government to back

<EM>&gt; e.g., _The Rule of Experts: Occupational Licensing in America_ by S. David

<P>A State Supreme Court ruling in Vermont a few years ago found that the legal
<BR>
requirements that a person's lawyer be an attorney did not explicitly require
<BR>
that the person have a law degree and be a member of the bar. It was shown that
<BR>
there is historical evidence that there is a distinct difference between what
<BR>
the definitions of an attorney is, and what an attorney-at-law is. The VBA was
<BR>
rather miffed at this....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The remedy for this situation seems quite clear:  Eliminate government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interference in the market.  Of course, one could choose the typical route:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Increase government interference to undo the problems of previous government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interventions.  BUT that only results in a spiral of regulations, protected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; businesses and people, and politics coopting consumer choice.  At least,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this has almost always been the case when people opt for more and stricter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regulations.  (In fact, I can't think of one counterexample to this claim.:)

<EM>&gt; * Recently, the law clinic at some Louisiana law school was banned from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helping people unless the people being helped could prove they made less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than some minimum income standard.  The reason?  People were using the law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clinic to sue one of the governor's supporters over, I believe, some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pollution issue.  The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that this was practicing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law without a license -- except in the case of the indigent.  In other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; words, the court protected the monopoly privilige of lawyers from an actual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competitor.  (I believe this was on either &quot;60 Minutes&quot; a few months ago.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds typical, though Lousiana's legal system practices Civil Law rather than
<BR>
Common Law, so I'm not sure how this would be different.
