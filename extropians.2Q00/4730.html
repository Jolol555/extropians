<P>
Some people wont have read these for a while. I recommend taking a minute to
<BR>
have a read and re-absorb.
<BR>
<P><P>1. Perpetual Progress - Seeking more intelligence, wisdom, and
<BR>
effectiveness, an indefinite lifespan, and the removal of political,
<BR>
cultural, biological, and psychological limits to self-actualization and
<BR>
self-realization. Perpetually overcoming constraints on our progress and
<BR>
possibilities. Expanding into the universe and advancing without end.
<BR>
2. Self-Transformation - Affirming continual moral, intellectual, and
<BR>
physical self-improvement, through critical and creative thinking, personal
<BR>
responsibility, and experimentation. Seeking biological and neurological
<BR>
augmentation along with emotional and psychological refinement.
<BR>
3. Practical Optimism - Fueling action with positive expectations. Adopting
<BR>
a rational, action-based optimism, in place of both blind faith and stagnant
<BR>
pessimism.
<BR>
4. Intelligent Technology - Applying science and technology creatively to
<BR>
transcend &quot;natural&quot; limits imposed by our biological heritage, culture, and
<BR>
environment. Seeing technology not as an end in itself but as an effective
<BR>
means towards the improvement of life.
<BR>
5. Open Society - Supporting social orders that foster freedom of speech,
<BR>
freedom of action, and experimentation. Opposing authoritarian social
<BR>
control and favoring the rule of law and decentralization of power.
<BR>
Preferring bargaining over battling, and exchange over compulsion. Openness
<BR>
to improvement rather than a static utopia.
<BR>
6. Self-Direction - Seeking independent thinking, individual freedom,
<BR>
personal responsibility, self-direction, self-esteem, and respect for
<BR>
others.
<BR>
7. Rational Thinking - Favoring reason over blind faith and questioning over
<BR>
dogma. Remaining open to challenges to our beliefs and practices in pursuit
<BR>
of perpetual improvement. Welcoming criticism of our existing beliefs while
<BR>
being open to new ideas.
<BR>
<P>I have a bone to pick about the first principle. I don't think that it adds
<BR>
much that the other principles don't already say, and I think it is overly
<BR>
simplistic about &quot;progress&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Principle 1 breaks down as follows:
<BR>
<P>Seeking more intelligence, wisdom, and effectiveness,
<BR>
&nbsp;- See principles 2,4
<BR>
<P>an indefinite lifespan,
<BR>
&nbsp;- principle 4, although it is good to have it stated overtly like this
<BR>
<P>and the removal of political, cultural, biological, and psychological limits
<BR>
to self-actualization and self-realization.
<BR>
&nbsp;- Political Limits, Principle 5. Cultural &amp; biological limits, Principle 4.
<BR>
Psychological limits, maybe all the rest of the principles except Principle
<BR>
5
<BR>
<P>Perpetually overcoming constraints on our progress and possibilities.
<BR>
&nbsp;- Why not just &quot;Perpetually overcoming constraints on our
<BR>
self-actualisation and self-realization&quot;? Removes that dogmatic
<BR>
&quot;progressive&quot; tone.
<BR>
<P>Expanding into the universe and advancing without end.
<BR>
&nbsp;- &quot;To boldly go where no one has gone before&quot;. Keep this, it's fantastic.
<BR>
<P>I'm not trying to heap crap on the principles, I'm trying to apply some
<BR>
constructive criticism. In particular, I think they ought to be as
<BR>
orthogonal as possible, meaning relatively clear demarkation between each
<BR>
one, and not saying the same thing twice (like I just did). Principle 1,
<BR>
besides the final sentence (best spoken by Patrick Stuart), adds little of
<BR>
merit, and adds an unfortunate implication of intellectual closemindedness,
<BR>
and ignorance of the complex, non-linear nature of the complex systems (us,
<BR>
and the rest of the universe).
<BR>
<P>Thoughts?
<BR>
