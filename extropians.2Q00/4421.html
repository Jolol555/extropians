<EM>&gt; survival foods and has strong belief in the Second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Amendment; and who distrusts big government.  Any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these may qualify a person as a cultist but certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than one of these would cause us to look at this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person as a threat and his family as being in a risk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situation that qualifies for government interference.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>While Janet Reno didn't say this (as has been noted by other individuals),
<BR>
this is almost verbatim from an FBI pub from around the same period on how
<BR>
to identify potential domestic terrorists.  And yes, people who dislike or
<BR>
don't trust the government, people who own guns, and people who advocate
<BR>
home schooling were mentioned.  In fact, sections of it sounded like they
<BR>
were describing the Libertarian party platform.
<BR>
<P>I read it last year so I don't remember the details, but it basically
<BR>
profiled a large section of the population that doesn't fall into some
<BR>
definition of &quot;mainstream&quot; as being potential terrorists.  A fair
<BR>
percentage of the people on this list would probably meet their profile,
<BR>
myself included.  Advocating a position not popular with the current
<BR>
government makes you somebody the FBI needs to look into according to the
<BR>
FBI.
