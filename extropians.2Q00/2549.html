<EM>&gt; &gt; Thats not a problem, thats a solution.  {8^D  Thanks John.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I guess an upvert would be a person who wished to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sexual relations with any enhanced post-human entity.  Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the only one of those I know of is 7 of 9, im waaaay upverted.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, no, no, since sex in a post-human world will be entirely
<BR>
meme exchange based, an upvert is one who wanted to resort to
<BR>
attempt a meme transmission using nanobots carriers delivered by
<BR>
actual physical coupling.  I mean really, what is the bandwidth for
<BR>
that operation!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Death to 7 of 9, the Borg, Data, and Spock, proud upholders of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frickin' *stupid* tradition that intelligent people are supposed to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unable to understand emotions.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  7 of 9 understands emotions quite well, but views them
<BR>
as useless or counterproductive.  The Borg as a collective has no
<BR>
&quot;evolved&quot; center to generate emotions and the emotions of the individuals
<BR>
are subsumed into the purposes of the collective (its like asking a
<BR>
&quot;city&quot; to have emotions).  Data, I think understood the motivations
<BR>
behind emotions, he just couldn't produce them himself (again no
<BR>
evolved emotion center).  Presumably, &quot;duty&quot; and &quot;logic&quot; provided
<BR>
emotions for Data since you have to have something to &quot;motivate&quot;
<BR>
any activity.  So Data simply had different emotions.  Now, Spock
<BR>
on the other hand, did in some circumstances have emotions, but
<BR>
was trained in many respects to suppress them as undesirable,
<BR>
in a way not too dissimilar from 7 of 9.  Its a different mindset,
<BR>
altering the context of emotions so they are like &quot;mosquitos&quot; sitting
<BR>
on your arm sucking blood, with neural responses signaling that a
<BR>
response may be desired.  In Spock or 7 of 9, you simply notice
<BR>
the mosquito, make a decision as to whether it is likely to represent
<BR>
a hazard (from a health standpoint) that would warrent the expenditure
<BR>
of effort to kill it and go to sick bay for a bioscan.  Somewhat different
<BR>
from the standard human response of &quot;kill the damn sucker&quot;.
<BR>
<P>So, the management of emotions has a variety of subtle aspects
<BR>
in the history of Star Trek, and I would not denigrate them quite
<BR>
so easily.
<BR>
<P>Now, back to &quot;upverting&quot; (clearly an illicit act in a future context).
<BR>
My curiosity is aroused, given the nature of this community [overintellectual,
<BR>
potentially stay-at-homes, but with very active imaginations...] as to
<BR>
what the frequency of &quot;unusual acts or observations&quot; among the group.
<BR>
Assuming a standard of &quot;acts that contemporary individuals would be
<BR>
'shocked' by&quot; *or* &quot;acts that would merit serious consideration for
<BR>
Penthouse Letters&quot; *or* something that might merit a serious discussion
<BR>
with a representative of the &quot;law&quot;, what is your personal frequency
<BR>
of occurence?
<BR>
<P>I'm not looking for details here, I'm simply looking for frequency:
<BR>
(1/day, 1/month, 1/year, 1/decade, 1/century, etc.).  Note, you
<BR>
personally do not have to be directly involved, you may be an
<BR>
intentional or unintentional observer.  (Just not &quot;I heard ...&quot; stories).
