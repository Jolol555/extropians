CNet has an interview with Kevin Mitnick at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1781398.html?tag=st.ne.1002.thed.1005-200-1781398">http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1781398.html?tag=st.ne.1002.thed.1005-200-1781398</A>.
<BR>
Here, an important new piece of information comes out which suggests
<BR>
that the actions to restrict Mitnick's speaking engagements is in fact
<BR>
based on terms which he agreed to for his probation:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: Why do you think they've given you this prohibition?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: The conditions of my probation are that I couldn't act as computer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consultant or advisor, and the probation department is interpreting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that to be that I'm not allowed to speak or write about technology.
<BR>
<P>Earlier the only provision mentioned from his agreement was that he could
<BR>
not use computer technology, and it was hard to see how making money
<BR>
speaking about computers would fall under that prohibition.  But if
<BR>
Mitnick also agreed not to act as a computer consultant or advisor,
<BR>
then I think it is very reasonable to interpret that to preclude his
<BR>
speaking about computer issues for a fee.
<BR>
<P>My guess is that the purpose of this provision is to restrict Mitnick
<BR>
from profiting due to his notoriety as a hacker.  Otherwise there is
<BR>
danger that he could become a role model, which might encourage others
<BR>
to try to emulate his celebrity by commiting computer crimes of their own.
<BR>
<P>Mitnick's probation lasts for three years.  After that he has all the
<BR>
rights and privileges of any other convicted felon.  But until then he
<BR>
is under close judicial supervision.  Probation is granted in place of
<BR>
jail time.  It's sort of a halfway condition.  Even though Mitnick is
<BR>
walking around freely, he doesn't have the rights of a free man.
<BR>
