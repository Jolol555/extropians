<EM>&gt;  Greg, I disagree, the problem wasn't that space didn't pay,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the problem was that we *gave space away*.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  And no.  See below.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Still, I bet we *really* showed those socialists with our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  government funded space missions, huh?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep - what a colossal irony that was; and just to put the last (?) ironic 
<BR>
punctuation on the story, Mir is rescued by private interests, while ISS 
<BR>
lumbers along in its statist, inefficient way.  (And to add a minor insult, I 
<BR>
read last week that NASA has NOT yet committed to the X-38 as the ISS life 
<BR>
boat.  I thought they'd finally done something right by letting Rutan develop 
<BR>
the X-38 mainly with inexpensive off-the-shelf components . . . Now they'll 
<BR>
probably fiddle-fart around and let some huge GovCorp contract to study and 
<BR>
spend for a decade before they build something ten times more expensive and 
<BR>
half as capable.  Hopefully, some bright entrepreneur will pick up the X-38, 
<BR>
bolt it on top of a rocket and get the hell up there on her own.)

<P><EM>&gt; Not completely true.  Space access would have been cheaper under a free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  market regime from the start.  Recall where Goddard got his funding from.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  But be that as it may, the problem is not that space access is expensive,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  but that the governments subsidize space programs to begin with.  This made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  private launches untenable.  Surely, government programs cost more, BUT the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  whole cost is not passed on to Hughes or other users of government launch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  vehicles.  Instead, the taxpayer funds that.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, I'll certainly agree that as a rule and on the whole government projects 
<BR>
cost more and are less efficient than an equivalent program carried out by 
<BR>
private interests.  But consider the possibility that the Apollo effort was 
<BR>
DISECONOMIC to begin with, given the then-state-of-the-art, i.e. given the 
<BR>
available incentives, sufficient private investment simply wouldn't have been 
<BR>
forthcoming in the 1960s.  You must at least concede the possibility that 
<BR>
this was true.  The original quote I offered from David Harland's book really 
<BR>
suggested this interpretation of history - i.e. that the Kennedy/NASA effort 
<BR>
was simply &quot;ahead of its time&quot;.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; I'm no rocket scientist (but I play one when I take people down to MSC 
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; tour), but I think simply reproducing the Saturn V would get you nowhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; fast.  It was designed on the premise of non-reusability and LOTS of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; money.  I think you agree that that design philosophy is NOT the way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  go.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The main point is: it's a proven technology.  Ergo, you don't have to spend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  lots on R&amp;D to come up with your super special design.  A secondary point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is: reusability does NOT guarantee efficiency.  The American Space Shuttle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is proof that reusable vehicles can cost more to fly and maintain.  
</EM><BR>
Remember
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  also, if you're making a disposable launch vehicle, then you need not worry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  about a lot of maintenance problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>All true, and this discussion's been done to death (and beyond) in space 
<BR>
policy and space business circles.  Given that my thinking about REAL space 
<BR>
development is now ALMOST entirely focused on the era of semi-mature 
<BR>
Drexlerian nanotech, I might well agree that &quot;reusability&quot; as it's currently 
<BR>
conceived may not be as important as I once thought.  Instead, &quot;mutability&quot; 
<BR>
may be the watchword for good design :-)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Daniel, if you're going to ask Earth to support an extraterrestrial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  economy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; I think you have to come up with an economic rationale.  I'm waiting . . 
</EM><BR>
.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I don't mean that at all.  What I mean is that the Biosphere concept has 
</EM><BR>
got
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  to be put into the context of merely one plan to colonize and exploit 
</EM><BR>
space.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I would rather look for a way to get the resources that will be spent in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  other ways, such as, e.g. (and this is just an example; I'm trying to break
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  people out of the Biosphere idea), oxygen from Moon rocks, than worry about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a delicate ecosystem recycling my oxygen.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed there, as well.  With the kinds of technology that will ultimately 
<BR>
make REAL space development an economically and socially viable possibility, 
<BR>
truly &quot;closed loop&quot; biosystems may well not be necessary.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  As for economic rationales, there are plenty.  Power from orbiting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  satellites is an oldie.  Manufactured goods from space is another.  Moving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  pollution creating industries to space is another.  Moving dangerous 
</EM><BR>
biotech
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  and nanotech research off the Earth.  Tourism.  Etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>With respect, I agree: there are plenty of economic rationales, there just 
<BR>
aren't any good ones right now, outside of Earth observation and 
<BR>
communication.  I can offer the opportunity to engage in Zero-G Ballet as an 
<BR>
economic rationale for space development.  I can do it passionately.  But it 
<BR>
shouldn't convince anyone, because the numbers just don't work.  If you find 
<BR>
someone who has RIGOROUSLY worked out the economics for large-scale space 
<BR>
development with current technology, please let me know - I haven't seen it 
<BR>
yet.
