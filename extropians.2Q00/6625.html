<P><EM>&gt;         As I understand it, melatonin is responsible for the reset of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the biological clock and is released during the night.  I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frequently been told that when you are forced to operate on night
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hours, the best way to ward off sleepiness is to work in a low or no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light environment, as this triggers the release of melatonin.  Is this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generally true and are there safer and more useful ways to sustain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well-being during these conditions?
</EM><BR>
<P>I would rather say you should do the opposite. Light inhibits the
<BR>
release of melatonin, which is (among other things) why we feel more
<BR>
alert and happy in bright sunlight and why people often have trouble
<BR>
falling alseep in lit rooms. Conversely, if you work in the dark you
<BR>
have a higher chance of becoming sleepy. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         As far as I can tell, the general symptoms of this behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are depression, fatigue, and anxiety.  I'm interested as to if anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has any knowledge of the long term effect of this behavior on one's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general health and longevity, as well as ways to counter any possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effects.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds likely. You essentially get a form of jet-lag as your
<BR>
biological rhythms do not fit with your activity patterns. Try working
<BR>
in brightly lit areas during the night, and sleep in carefully
<BR>
darkened rooms during the day. Possibly melatonin supplements could be
<BR>
used to really fix the schedule.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	Further, are there any technologies in development that are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feasible tools to reduce the general amount of sleep required by an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not as far as I know, although there are likely some gains to be made
<BR>
from learning to sleep more efficiently (however that is done :-). The
<BR>
memory consolidation that appears to go on during sleep is likely
<BR>
tricky to speed up, but if I find a way I'm sure you will notice. :-)
