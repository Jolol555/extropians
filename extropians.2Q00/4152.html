<EM>&gt; &gt; They are certainly many scenes in the movie that do not correspond to hard

<EM>&gt; &gt; science, nor to precedence within the movie.  When Trinity shoots the agent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on the roof, she says &quot;dodge this&quot;, why does he not?  Well that it did not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It actually goes beyond this.  Why do any of the agents bullets ever miss?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems that the agents have virtually unlimited processing capacity at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their disposal but limited bandwidth into the Matrix, less apparently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than even the humans.  Clearly the agents aren't a physical part of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Matrix, otherwise they would be able respond almost instantaneously to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rapidly changing event streams in the Matrix.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One thing that is clear from the movie, and which may have ramifications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the sequels, is that there seem to be several very large systems in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existence with Matrix-class computational abilities, all of which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loosely interconnected.  These systems appear to be quite capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running one or more AIs.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're onto something James. I've been thinking on the same lines...
<BR>
<P>Thing is, the old cracker versus sysadmin storyline doesn't hold up to
<BR>
much. If the AIs were truly in control of the system, the resistance
<BR>
wouldn't have a chance. They could do whatever they liked with the
<BR>
simulation, and they could also just not allow the Nebuchanezzar's
<BR>
signal to access the system.
<BR>
<P>My idea - they're not.
<BR>
<P>I should introduce a little project of mine. I'm an avid roleplayer,
<BR>
and so are thw two friends I was with when I first went to see the film.
<BR>
About five minutes after walking out of the film, in the middle of
<BR>
conversation, we all suddenly stopped and had the same thought...
<BR>
<P>&quot;Damn, wouldn't a Matrix RPG be cool?&quot;
<BR>
<P>And so, I'm writing it.
<BR>
<P>This is an interesting challenge. You know how, when a good book or
<BR>
something gets made into a film, it is inevitably simplified and changed,
<BR>
in a somewhat predictable manner?
<BR>
<P>Well, basically I'm working to do the reverse. Also, since the objective
<BR>
is an RPG, the universe has to be even more well thought out and
<BR>
consistent.
<BR>
<P>Now - where was I? Oh yes, the AIs. No, they don't control the Matrix.
<BR>
If they did, the resistance wouldn't stand a chance. The Matrix is the
<BR>
ultimate development of the 'net. The AIs have taken over much of it,
<BR>
and connected vast numbers of humans to it via their own constructed
<BR>
systems (the ones you see Neo awake in). They can monitor the I/O of
<BR>
everyone connected to the Matrix *through their systems*. That's what
<BR>
the Agents are doing with their earpieces - they are alerted to surprise
<BR>
reactions from anyone in the city. And they can then take over that
<BR>
person's connection (this is how they 'posess' their bodies).
<BR>
<P>At this point, I should introduce you a little to the client/server
<BR>
structure of the Matrix.
<BR>
<P>There is a master server. The AIs do not have control of this. In fact,
<BR>
it seems no-one even knows where it is, or who controls it. It is that
<BR>
system which runs the simulation.
<BR>
<P>There are secondary servers, to which the end clients (people) actually
<BR>
connect. The AIs have built there own, and interfaced it to the network.
<BR>
Now, the master server requires a *lot* of integrity checks on the
<BR>
secondary servers. One of these is to ensure the physical statistics
<BR>
(speed, strength, etc) for the connected clients are not tampered with.
<BR>
<P>Fortunately for the AIs, there was a loophole in this part of the
<BR>
system, which allowed them to introduce a small number (three) of
<BR>
entities with all attributes pushed to maximum. This gives them their
<BR>
speed and their strength... but as Morpheus says, &quot;they still live in a
<BR>
universe based on rules&quot;.
<BR>
<P>So, what are the resistance fighters doing to bend the rules?
<BR>
<P>Ever played Quake 3?
<BR>
<P>One of the features of that game's multiplayer system is client-side
<BR>
processing. With older multiplayer games, you had to rely on the server
<BR>
for all your information. Now, the server can just tell you that player
<BR>
4 has fired a rocket on whatever trajectory, and your machine can track
<BR>
it itself. This allows the game to require less bandwidth, and be less
<BR>
limited by the players' network latency. The dreaded Laaaaaaaagggg...
<BR>
<P>This isn't exclusive to Quake 3. It's been done before - one of the best
<BR>
examples is Jedi Knight. The usual problem with lag is that other
<BR>
players look like they're in one place, but they've actually already
<BR>
moved from there - you just havent' been informed of the move yet. This
<BR>
makes shooting them bloody difficult, and insanely frustrating. JK
<BR>
allowed the player's game client to have a say in whether they made a
<BR>
hit. That is, if your opponent looked like he was standing in front of
<BR>
you, and your client thought you'd hit him, the server believed your
<BR>
client and they took the appropriate damage.
<BR>
<P>Now... see what I'm getting at? These systems rely on the closed-source
<BR>
nature of the clients - because by sending the appropriate signals to
<BR>
the server, one can cheat (in JK, the trick on LAN games was to wait
<BR>
till your opponent was right in front of you, disconnect your network
<BR>
cable, whack him a few times with your lightsaber, and then plug
<BR>
yourself back in...)
<BR>
<P>So what the resistance fighters are doing is exploiting the system's
<BR>
support of client-side processing. If they *believe* they can move that
<BR>
fast, they do.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Don't think you can... *know* you can!&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Morpheus
<BR>
<P>All goes quite neatly, n'est pas?
<BR>
<P>Hmmm... what else? Oh yes... what are the AIs actually *doing*. Well,
<BR>
there's a number of guesses. Maybe they're observing us. Perhaps they
<BR>
think existence inside the Matrix is in our own best interests [this is
<BR>
my actual thinking behind it all - when the AI consciousness was
<BR>
started, it was given a set of imperatives similar to Asimov's laws -
<BR>
it was to protect the humans and make them happy. This is how it chose
<BR>
to do it]. Oh, and there's even some crackpots who think they're using
<BR>
us for batteries... [Morpheus's nonsense is debunked thoroughly in my
<BR>
version].
<BR>
<P>Other bits and pieces...
<BR>
<P>The Oracle? Ew. Yuck. Leaving that out - I can't find any useful way
<BR>
to explain that.
<BR>
<P>The One? Yuck also. I am sick of Messiah plotlines.
<BR>
<P>Neo's death &amp; revival - although I didn't particularly like the Sleeping
<BR>
Beauty ending, this can be covered. His real body wasn't actually
<BR>
damaged, of course. And his mind had become sufficently free from the
<BR>
system and aware of its nature (see the scene where he begins to see
<BR>
the whole world, and the agents, as green lines of code to be
<BR>
manipulated at his will) that he wasn't quite as immersed. Although his
<BR>
heart stopped briefly, external stimulus (Trinity touching him, and
<BR>
telling him she loved him) was enough to bring his attention to the real
<BR>
world.
<BR>
<P><P><P>I've got quite a lot more ideas on this going round - but I'd quite like
<BR>
to hear everyone's opinions on what I've said so far.
