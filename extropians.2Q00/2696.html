<P>GEORGE SOROS LAYS DOWN CHALLENGE TO BROWN BY BUYING GOLD.
<BR>
<P>Word has it that George Soros, the Hungarian genius, is buying gold. OK,
<BR>
Everyone knows that when such news gets around it is usually because he is
<BR>
poised to sell
<BR>
to those who think they can make money by riding on his back. In the case of
<BR>
gold, which has performed abysmally for a long time apart from the brief spike
<BR>
when
<BR>
the central banks made their announcement last September, such a ploy is
<BR>
unlikely.
<BR>
<P>Only last week Soros announced that he was withdrawing from aggressive hedge
<BR>
fund management because markets are now &quot;too volatile.&quot; This could reasonably be
<BR>
translated as saying that the equity, bond and currency markets in which he has
<BR>
made so much money are now too transparent. In other words it has become ever
<BR>
easier for his operations to be tracked and this means, in turn, that he can no
<BR>
longer remain one jump ahead.
<BR>
<P>The man is no longer a hungry fighter and as his book, The Crisis of Global
<BR>
Capitalism&quot; shows he is happy to give more of his time to philosophising. He has
<BR>
argued
<BR>
that the ideals of tolerant democracies can be threatened by those with an
<BR>
absolutist faith in the free market to the extent that market mechanism is
<BR>
allowed to assume
<BR>
a position of overriding importance.
<BR>
<P>Once a man gets wrapped up in philosophy his thoughts turn to the longer term.
<BR>
The dollar, as Soros knows better than most, is in a high risk area. The US
<BR>
economy
<BR>
has been pumped up on the strength of a private sector credit bubble, and the
<BR>
dollar depends on huge capital inflows. There is also a head of political
<BR>
pressure
<BR>
building up to persuade the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, slow down
<BR>
the US economy and take the pressure off the euro.
<BR>
<P>To the new long termist Soros this must provide an ideal opportunity. He can
<BR>
pick up gold easily enough from politicians and central bankers who have never
<BR>
made a
<BR>
trading profit in their lives. Such buying would be difficult to detect, so he
<BR>
would be under no pressure. And when the moment eventually comes, as come it
<BR>
must,
<BR>
when the dollar falls he will pull off the coup of a lifetime.
<BR>
<P>Gold went up US$4 last week despite the news that the Swiss were going to put
<BR>
120 tonnes on the market by September. Brown will continue with his gold sales.
<BR>
All Soros has to do is sign cheques and sell off loose holdings in his Quantum
<BR>
portfolio. Gives him plenty of time for philosophy in the long summer months.
