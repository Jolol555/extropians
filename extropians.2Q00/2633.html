<P><EM> &gt; What I want to know is the explanation for wanting to have
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; an opinion on killing a copy of one's self.
</EM><BR>
<P>The copy question is to transhumanism as black holes are to
<BR>
theoretical physics.  It's an extreme.  Its only immediate
<BR>
value is to provide us with clues about important subjects
<BR>
like identity - for instance, &quot;how different is different?&quot;
<BR>
Transhumanism is *about* the malleability of identity, so
<BR>
this is not a topic we can or should ignore.  Further more,
<BR>
the copy question, and therefore your concepts of self and
<BR>
identity, can lead to insight in other areas of philosophy.
<BR>
<P>And, if you accept the redundancy of your copy now, you'll
<BR>
get a free clock radio.
<BR>
<P>[We often talk about there being &quot;borganist&quot; transhumanists
<BR>
and &quot;individualist&quot; transhumanists.  I personally think a
<BR>
better split, if we have to have one, is on the question of
<BR>
identity.  I'm thinking &quot;continualist&quot; for those flaky,
<BR>
&quot;sanctity of the original&quot; types, but I don't have a name
<BR>
for the other side of this coin (the first person to say
<BR>
&quot;murderers&quot; receives their merit badge for superior wit).]
