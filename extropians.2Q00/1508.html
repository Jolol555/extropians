<P><EM>&gt; Experimental economists have been able to reliably induce asset bubbles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in lab experiments.  In such experiments, almost all traders are saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something like &quot;why are those fools still buying&quot;, as they then buy more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves.  Traders tend to think they can pull out before it falls, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it takes a fair bit of experience for them to learn otherwise, at which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point assets bubbles no longer happen.  Appropriately constructed futures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; markets can also make assets bubbles go away even with less experienced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traders.
</EM><BR>
<P>How about the existing financial futures markets?  Are they adequate to
<BR>
prevent irrational bubbles?  There are LEAPS options which are relatively
<BR>
long term (by market standards), two years or more.  If there are new
<BR>
kinds of financial instruments which could stabilize the markets, that
<BR>
would be very interesting to hear about.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Second, as far as hard landings: through most of history there has not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;been the understanding that we have today of macroeconomics.  Yes, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is still much to be learned, and people do not always behave predictably.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;But at the same time we can't deny the effectiveness of the US Federal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Reserve over the last two decades in moderating the business cycle and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;keeping the economy on a generally even keel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think many people do deny this.  I'm not sure I share your confidence.
</EM><BR>
<P>Take a look at <A HREF="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">http://www.nber.org/cycles.html</A>.  We see that the most
<BR>
recently completed business cycle, 07/81 - 07/90, had 16 months of
<BR>
contraction followed by 92 months of expansion.  The next, uncompleted
<BR>
cycle, had 8 months of contraction followed by, so far, 108 months of
<BR>
expansion (that last figure is not shown; it is 03/91 - 03/00).
<BR>
<P>So we will have two cycles in a row averaging over 100 months each
<BR>
of expansion.  This is unprecedented.  No earlier entries in the chart
<BR>
have anywhere this period of sustained economic growth.
<BR>
<P>If you look at their figures over the last 150 years we find that the
<BR>
down/up month ratio has gone from 18/35 pre WWI to 11/50 post WWII.
<BR>
The economy spent 1/3 of its time in recession back then, and only 1/6 of
<BR>
the time now.  This is a big improvement and I think we can give credit
<BR>
to our improved understanding of economic theory.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Stock prices may fall and even crash eventually, but we should not expect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a 1930s style depression as a result.  ...  There is still every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reason to expect significant, possibly unprecedented, economic growth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;over the next few decades, based on technology.  Ultimately that can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;support very high valuations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But there was also significant unprecedented technology growth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the 1930s.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is true, technological advances in themselves do not guarantee a
<BR>
healthy economy.  But if we avoid the monetary mistakes of the 1930s then
<BR>
technology growth should be able to continue to produce economic growth.
