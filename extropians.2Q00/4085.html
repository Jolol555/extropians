<EM>&gt;  &gt;how can anyone be angry at a dead person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  How do you feel about Hitler?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not anger. Actually I feel nothing about the individual. About the harm he 
<BR>
caused, and the murders he commited, I feel sickened,shocked,  horrified, 
<BR>
apalled and  distressed. He was terribly disturbed. Also many other 
<BR>
individuals contributed to that particular situation and I feel the same 
<BR>
emotions regarding the entire Nazi movement, of course!. I can make judgments 
<BR>
about his character, &amp; call him evil.  But to be angry at the man himself 
<BR>
would be pointless, wouldn't it? Wasted emotional energy. He is dead. 
<BR>
I *would* be angry at anyone alive today if they began espousing his views 
<BR>
however, since my anger could be turnedinto something rational, like a 
<BR>
protest, idictment or intervention. Perhaps I could modify their behavior in 
<BR>
some way. At least I could feel as if I tried. Those who do not remember the 
<BR>
past are doomed to reapeat it, as they say.
<BR>
<P>The past is over, so getting angry at, or it's denizens, it is a profitless 
<BR>
exercise.
