Hey Brian,
<BR>
<P>I'd like to see more on this topic.  I've been living this way for a few
<BR>
years now and have never been happier.  It's not that I wouldn't like to
<BR>
have more money--or, more accurately, to have more of the things money
<BR>
buys--but the opportunity to savor each day fully is worth more to me than
<BR>
the money would be.
<BR>
<P>When I was in the process of making the decision to discontinue my urban law
<BR>
practice and move to the country I pondered the lifestyle I'd choose if I
<BR>
had a nearly unlimited supply of money. I decided I'd live in the country
<BR>
and divide my time fairly evenly between gardening, study, and writing, with
<BR>
enough social interaction thrown in to keep me from becoming a hermit (I
<BR>
tend to be a rather solitary person).  I realized I didn't have to
<BR>
accumulate a large sum of money in order to do this very thing, and I'm now
<BR>
living a lifestyle that's close to my ideal. Perhaps if I had more money I'd
<BR>
live in a mansion rather than a self-built adobe hovel.  But then again,
<BR>
maybe not...every square foot of my house was built for my own purposes; the
<BR>
place fits me like a well-worn shoe, and it's been fun building it.
<BR>
<P>Did any particular event prompt you to investigate a simpler lifestyle?  My
<BR>
eyes began to open to wider possibilities when I spent a morning hanging out
<BR>
with a woman named Donna.  She was one of those generally referred to as
<BR>
&quot;homeless&quot; although I don't think she would have characterized herself in
<BR>
that way.  She'd found some pieces of lumber and sheet metal and built a
<BR>
shelter in a vacant city lot; she'd planted a little vegetable garden there
<BR>
next to her shelter.  She told me that the night before she'd found some
<BR>
lobster and shrimp in a grocery store dumpster and had invited a bunch of
<BR>
homeless people to share in her bounty.  &quot;I have so much,&quot; she told me, &quot;I
<BR>
feel as though I should share.&quot;
<BR>
<P>It occurred to me that overall, Donna's quality of life was higher than
<BR>
mine, although she was jobless and I enjoyed a position in one of the more
<BR>
highly paid professions.  Her days were her own; she lived by her own clock
<BR>
and didn't feel constantly rushed by this or that deadline; and she felt
<BR>
herself wealthy enough to indulge in charity. I'm forever grateful to this
<BR>
woman, whom I never saw again after that day.
<BR>
<P>Meeting Donna didn't move me to take up a life on the streets, but I began
<BR>
to give my thoughts a much wider scope in imagining possible futures for
<BR>
myself.
<BR>
<P>Bonnie

<BR>
<P>I am currently pursuing a more advanced state of what could be
<BR>
termed &quot;voluntary simplicity&quot; in pursuit of this goal.
