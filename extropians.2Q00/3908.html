According to Barbara Branden's biography of Rand, she was an admirerer of 
<BR>
the works of Salvador Dali. Dali's work, by his own admission, was 
<BR>
completely &quot;anti-reason&quot;. Branden says that Rand admired Dali's later work, 
<BR>
specifically his crucifixion scenes which he painted after his conversion to 
<BR>
Catholicism. Given Rand's theories of art, I would expect that such pictures 
<BR>
would be considered by her to be just a Christian glorification of suffering 
<BR>
(i.e. bad). And even in these paintings, Dali's surrealism makes itself 
<BR>
present (for example, Christ crucified on an unfolded hypercube). 
<BR>
Nevertheless, Rand liked his paintings.
<BR>
I think that the connection between artistic tastes and 
<BR>
philosophical/political bent is mainly imagined, especially by the artists 
<BR>
creating the work. This can be seen throughout art history. Dadaism, which 
<BR>
was an attack on all &quot;bourgoise&quot; values, is very similar in visual style to 
<BR>
Futurist works, but many Futurists ended up being supporters of Italian 
<BR>
Fascism. Much of Nazi art is glorification of the beauty of the human form, 
<BR>
such as in the films Olympia. This is the kind of visual art I would think 
<BR>
Rand would find most appealing, yet I cannot think of a single 
<BR>
political/philosophical belief she would have in common with the agenda it 
<BR>
is pushing. Many of the surrealists considered their work to be close to 
<BR>
communist ideals, and many of them joined the communist party, but Salvador 
<BR>
Dali, who epitomized the movement's visual look, was a supported of Franco. 
<BR>
Soviet filmmakers of the 1920s, like Eistenstein and Pudovkin, used an 
<BR>
editing style they considered to be particularly suited to communist 
<BR>
propaganda, yet their methods were highly influenced by an American 
<BR>
filmmaker they admired, D. W. Griffith, whose movie &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; is 
<BR>
probably the most racist movie in film history.
<BR>
Art history is full of examples of individuals of completely different 
<BR>
belief systems producing art of such similar styles, each claiming that the 
<BR>
aesthetic theory they are following reflects their convictions and social 
<BR>
goals, and Rand was not the first to claim that her own subjective tastes 
<BR>
somehow reflected an &quot;objective&quot; truth.
