</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Marines in the early-to-mid fifties, and came back with a profound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respect and desire for Jeep products.  For the rest of his life, he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bought Jeeps of all kinds and types.  His profession was realtor in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some pretty rugged territory in NE California and he was constantly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bemoaning how his Jeeps would crumble under the strain ( except for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the early versions).  The rest of the family tried for years to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him to try something, anything, else, but he never would.

<P><P>Me and my friends have thoroughly abused many vehicles in our frequent
<BR>
offroad excursions across the moutains and deserts of the western U.S. 
<BR>
We've put most popular makes of 4WD vehicles across some of the harshest
<BR>
terrain around here.  Most of the vehicles are only mildly modified for
<BR>
offroad usage e.g. improved suspensions, extra clearance, better tires.
<BR>
<P>Our collective experience:
<BR>
<P>Jeeps:  We've had numerous problems with both the Wranglers and Grand
<BR>
Cherokees.  Transmission failures seem to be common, and in general they
<BR>
have not lived up to their reputation as the ultimate offroad vehicles.
<BR>
<P>Nissan/Toyota/etc:  While decent and reliable for light offroad usage,
<BR>
they really suffer under more adverse conditions.  After destroying a few
<BR>
of these vehicles, no one I know actually has theirs any more.  Generally
<BR>
speaking, they are not rugged enough for our usage.
<BR>
<P>Classic American SUVs (full-size Bronco and similar):  These have become
<BR>
the predominant vehicles of my offroading friends, although none of
<BR>
us started with them.  These are some of the toughest, most indestructible
<BR>
vehicles ever created IMO.  We've never lost one in the field and never
<BR>
done significant damage to one.  Full-size American trucks are as good. 
<BR>
It is probably no coincidence that these are *the* most popular vehicles
<BR>
in the deep outback.
<BR>
<P>Modern American SUVs:  These aren't what they used to be.  The newer ones
<BR>
are more like 4WD Minivans than offroad capable vehicles.  We've never
<BR>
really put any of these through the paces, but offhand they do not look
<BR>
nearly as rugged or as capable as their predecessors.  And don't get me
<BR>
started on the luxury SUVs &lt;shudder&gt;.  
<BR>
<P>BTW, Landcruisers are a good choice.  Definitely among the best of the
<BR>
imports.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
