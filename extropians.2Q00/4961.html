</EM><BR>
<P>I'd include myself in that category.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What if a person had undergone such a radical personality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shift that he wold loathe his former self and wish to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forget the former self as though it had never existed?
</EM><BR>
<P>While I'd hardly say I loathe my former self (although if I
<BR>
were to loathe anyone, it would most likely be him), if
<BR>
possible I'd have parts of 'him' removed.  The only time I
<BR>
experience anger/resentment is in relation to &quot;baggage&quot; from
<BR>
my past, although this is usually fleeting (seconds to
<BR>
minutes) it's still unpleasant.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Was the former self a necessary precursor of the present
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self?  If so, could loathing the former self be considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same sort of unpleasant emotion as loathing one's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; present self?
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, while I don't loathe my present self, I am not
<BR>
satisfied with him.  I doubt I'd have a fun time with an
<BR>
exact copy - we'd both be too busy looking for flaws.
