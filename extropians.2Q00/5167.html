<EM>&gt; If they follow along our path then soon they will have to get into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whole singularity stuff, and whether or not accelerating it might provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another path for us instead of relinquishment or &quot;wait and see&quot; approaches.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Have they even done one article on the singularity before?
</EM><BR>
<P>They had an interview with Vinge back in 95, but searching their archives
<BR>
doesn't reveal much else.
<BR>
<P>One thing I did notice in the comments was that several people focused
<BR>
on one or another of Joy's troika: biotech, nanotech, and AI.  As I
<BR>
commented earlier, IMO these three technologies have very different
<BR>
properties in terms of their threats, and it is unfortunate that Joy
<BR>
has started off the conversation by lumping them together.
<BR>
<P>With nanotech the main fear is misuse.  There may be nanotech accidents
<BR>
but they are likely to be more restricted in scale because most nanotech
<BR>
will not be self-replicating, as that would make it relatively bulky
<BR>
and slow.
<BR>
<P>With biotech the main concern at this time is accidents, although misuse
<BR>
is also something to watch for.  Biotech is inherently self-replicating
<BR>
and so any mistakes could have widespread consequences.  Biotech based
<BR>
weapons are probably an even greater danger, but they are not new and
<BR>
so Joy couldn't have stirred up much fear by talking about them.
<BR>
<P>Then with AI the problem is not replication or misuse, but more likely
<BR>
it is the subtle challenge of living in a world in which humans may
<BR>
not be the most intelligent entities.  Obviously such a world has
<BR>
enormous potential for benefits, but there could easily be significant
<BR>
problems as well.  As with nanotech, it is the transition period where
<BR>
the greatest dangers lie, as we try to chart a course to a safe haven
<BR>
where the technology is mature.
<BR>
<P>Hopefully the ongoing debate about these issues will begin to consider
<BR>
these nuances as we move beyond Joy's fearmongering.
<BR>
<P>Wired has set up &quot;an email address&quot; (whatever that means - a mailing
<BR>
list?), <A HREF="mailto:whythefuture@wired.com?Subject=Re:%20Responses%20to%20Joy%20in%20Wired&In-Reply-To=&lt;200006141833.LAA24454@finney.org&gt;">whythefuture@wired.com</A> (rather discouraging name, that), &quot;so that
<BR>
readers can receive updates and alerts on issues and events related to
<BR>
the article, and to GNR technologies in general.&quot;  I sent in a subscribe
<BR>
message but didn't hear back yet.  Maybe this will be an opportunity to
<BR>
make our views heard.
