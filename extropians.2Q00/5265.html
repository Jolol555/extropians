<EM>&gt; Zero, I like what you've had to say. Defending communism (or is that

<EM>&gt; socialism?) on this list is a brave move!!!
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, thankyou Zero.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A distinction should really be made between Marxism, which is a bunch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting stuff with a very democratic edge to it, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Leninism/Stalinism/et al ism, which is what was put into practice in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;communist&quot; countries, and which actually bears little resemblance to what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Marx had to say. State socialism as practiced in the 20th century has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shown to fail (under less than ideal circumstances; that is, plonked in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; middle of a 300+ year old world capitalist system, which was extremely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hostile to it). Marxism, idealistic as it is, has never really had a run.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was meaning to post words to this effect in response to Michael
<BR>
LaTorra's comments earlier. You have said well what I was meaning to, so
<BR>
I will not add further other than to state I agree.
