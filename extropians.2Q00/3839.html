<P>My father notes that the soon-to-burn-up Iridium network has excellent
<BR>
potential as an uncontrolled communications medium.  As such, it might
<BR>
be a useful public service - for China in my father's example, although
<BR>
targeting Iran, or Iraq, is likely to generate less political fallout. 
<BR>
The classic Stiegler scenario involves mass-produced palmtops rather
<BR>
than large, bulky Iridium phones, but a global satellite network is at
<BR>
least a step towards the ideal.  Does anyone know how much it'd cost to
<BR>
run the ground control stations (assuming you can buy the satellite
<BR>
network for $1 or whatever); does anyone know when the network
<BR>
irreversibly de-orbits; and does anyone know of a handy 'illionaire (or
<BR>
a network of Chinese dissidents) who'd consider it worthwhile?
<BR>
<P>Personally, I think it unlikely that anyone will step up to fund this in
<BR>
time.  But the idea is certainly worth passing on - as is the underlying
<BR>
challenge.  For example, if it turns out that active Iridium phones are
<BR>
too easy to detect:  What would it take to overlay static on a voice/fax
<BR>
line, or bit twitches on a digital cellphone connection, that were
<BR>
distinguishable from random noise *only* if you possessed the encryption
<BR>
key?  And what bandwidth could you get?  Could you run a FreeNet network
<BR>
over random, innocently-made cellphone calls that happened to be made
<BR>
from phones plugged into a FreeNet laptop?  And is FreeNet a good
<BR>
architecture for supporting revolutionary cells?

<P>From:  M. Yudkowsky (<A HREF="mailto:m.yudkowsky@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Iridium%20dissident%20network&In-Reply-To=&lt;392EF2B6.8B6F9399@pobox.com&gt;">m.yudkowsky@pobox.com</A>)
&gt;
&gt; When speaking to a friend the other evening, he mentioned the &quot;folk
&gt; theorem&quot; that if access to fax machines were available to some magic
&gt; percentage of the population of China, the Chinese government would lose
&gt; control of information, and thus control of the people.
&gt; 
&gt; I disagreed. US corporations, not to mention European ones, would
&gt; cheerfully sell the Chinese government software to monitor all telephone
&gt; lines for faxes. I can easily imagine a system that requires each fax to
&gt; identify itself, with copies of each fax kept by the government.
&gt; 
&gt; However, there is a complete telecommunications system accessible by
&gt; Chinese dissidents that isn't under the control of the Chinese
&gt; government. I refer to the Iridium system, now bankrupt and so
&gt; hopelessly un-economical that the sattelites are about to be deorbited.
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine, if you will, that a consortium of expatriate Chinese purchase
&gt; the satellites for $1 apiece, and pay for the ground stations to run
&gt; them. They would have a system available to the Chinese dissidents that
&gt; the Chinese government can't control.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, there's lots of questions to be answered about this idea; to
&gt; solve the problems, I am thinking of a process that can perhaps be
&gt; described as the first open-source revolutionary manifesto. 
&gt; 
&gt; Some thoughts to seed debate:
&gt; 
&gt; * The cost of a satellite phone would have to drop dramatically. Of
&gt; course, it would no longer have to look pretty -- it'd simply have to be
&gt; &quot;concealable.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; * The cost of putting Iridium into orbit is irrevocably gone; but if the
&gt; bankruptcy lawyers smell money, the sharks may gather, which would put
&gt; paid to the project. Perhaps they can be bought off by promises of
&gt; future profits.
&gt; 
&gt; * A good 60% of the cost of running a phone system is in billing. If the
&gt; dissidents dispense with billing, the costs drop dramatically.
&gt; 
&gt; * Authorization of users would still be needed to prevent
&gt; denial-of-service attacks by the Chinese government.
&gt; 
&gt; * This system would also be of use to Iranian dissidents.
&gt; 
&gt; * Politically, the companies who sell Iridium to dissidents will be
&gt; targeted by the Chinese government. Can this problem be overcome? Or
&gt; will the Iridium consortium members decide to make a long-term
&gt; investment in the future, in the next Chinese government?
&gt; 
&gt; * If the Iridium consortium decide NOT to sell, can the satellites be stolen?
&gt; 
&gt; * This project must be financed on a voluntary basis: this is an
&gt; extremely modern model of doing business; it may not work; the backers
&gt; must be willing to shoulder losses. Perhaps some brave company will
&gt; advertise over the network...
