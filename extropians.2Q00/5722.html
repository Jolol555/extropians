<P><EM>&gt;The Chinese never really used gunpowder as more than a curiousity, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they never invented anything that could properly be considered a gun in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any conventional sense.  
</EM><BR>
<P>No guns, but they did have cannon, which were a critical part of the
<BR>
Ming military system against steppe nomads.  It's certainly true they
<BR>
did far less with it than the Europeans did.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Another example of this is Chinese shipbuilding in the late 15th and early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;16th century (IIRC), which was around the time the Portugese were the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dominant European sea-faring nation.  Towards the end of the 15th century,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Chinese took an interest in shipbuilding and proceeded to produce very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fine ships, some of which were over twice as long and had ten times the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;displacement of the largest European vessels being produced at the time. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They sailed these around Asia and into the Indian ocean, trading with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;local merchants and occasionally with the Europeans by proxy.  By the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1530's though, the Powers-That-Were decided that there was no value to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being an sea-faring society and had the enormous ships dismantled.  Had the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Chinese exploited their excellent shipbuilding technology to its fullest,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the world might be organized differently today.
</EM><BR>
<P>Possibly, although the European were far ahead in a number of seafaring
<BR>
technologies.  They were far better at navigation, sailing into the
<BR>
wind, and they had designed good shipborne cannon.  The Arabs could
<BR>
also make large sturdy ships in huge numbers, but the Portuguese still
<BR>
blew them to bits.  I often see claims that the European did not catch
<BR>
the Chinese technologically prior to 1700 or so, but I don't see that
<BR>
as justified.  
<BR>
<P>It would be interesting sociology to discuss the differences between
<BR>
the innovative and outward-looking Southern Song and the conservative
<BR>
and repressive Ming (which government was responsible for the innovation-
<BR>
squashing you discuss).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The Chinese are an interesting example of a society structured in such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way that the impact of technology on the social order is reduced to an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;abolute minimum.  I don't think most of us would be comfortable in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;type of environment, but it does describe a stable form of change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suppression that has a long history of working well in isolation.  If they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;had not been faced with the more aggressively competitive environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;created by the Europeans, I suspect China today would have changed little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from its historical forms.
