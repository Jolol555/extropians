<P>
I don't want to get into the Microsoft debate, but I do have some history
<BR>
from my 20 years in the computer industry.

AM,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; In actual fact, Microsoft has never relied on secret APIs. Sometimes they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get lazy about documenting everything, but I have yet to see anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially important in an undocumented API function (and I've done a LOT
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Windows programming). What they have done is to write their apps to take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every possible advantage of their OS.
</EM><BR>
<P>The have written their APIs to act differently depending on whether it was
<BR>
being called from a Microsoft program or from a competitor's program.
<BR>
Microsoft's font smoothing routines used to check for the calling program,
<BR>
and returned smooth fonts to Internet Explorer while returning jagged fonts
<BR>
to Netscape.  Their printer software used to grab the printer queue from a
<BR>
Novell NetWare queue, and then playing &quot;keep-away&quot; by passing control among
<BR>
the Windows PCs until they were all finished before returning control back
<BR>
to the Novell queue for non-Microsoft clients to use.  Microsoft servers
<BR>
used to prioritize web page requests and serving all Internet Explorer
<BR>
requests before serving Netscape requests.  They also used to give false
<BR>
error messages to Netscape browsers claiming that it could not read the file
<BR>
type, when in reality it could, but the server refused to give it to
<BR>
Netscape.  The original Windows used to refuse to let non-Microsoft DOSes
<BR>
call some of their routines which they considered propriatery.  The Mac
<BR>
version of Excel was found to have timing loops that actually made it run
<BR>
slower than the Windows version.  The disk formatter used to seek out OS/2
<BR>
partitions and corrupt them.  The MSN network used to edit the CompuServe
<BR>
and AOL prefs files and corrupt them.  MSN changed the format of the
<BR>
Macintosh control panel so that Microsoft products would work, but all other
<BR>
products stopped working.  Microsoft claimed that all of these were
<BR>
accidental programming errors.  They never could explain why they were
<BR>
editing competitor's product files anyway.
<BR>
<P>I say &quot;used to&quot;, because after these things were discovered, Microsoft fixed
<BR>
them and claimed they were programming errors.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Microsoft does not own the hardware companies, and it does not have a
</EM><BR>
magic
<BR>
<EM>&gt; wand that controls the industry. If hardware vendors pre-install MS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software, they do so because they thing their customers want them to.
</EM><BR>
<P>Microsoft used to claim a rediculously high price for Windows.  They would
<BR>
give a rediculously low price to hardware manufacturers who shipped only
<BR>
Microsoft OSes on their PCs.  The price of the Microsoft product depended on
<BR>
whether a vendor was working with Microsoft's competitors or not.  As an
<BR>
employee of IBM, I know that it was impossible to ship a PC with OS/2 on it.
<BR>
We had to ship PCs with Windows pre-installed, and instructions on how to
<BR>
remove Windows and install OS/2.  Every purchase of OS/2 included a purchase
<BR>
of Windows, whether the customer wanted it or not.
<BR>
<P>This also warped the product counts.  Every copy of OS/2 also counted as a
<BR>
purchase of Windows, so OS/2 never could catch up with Windows in the
<BR>
market.  Similarly, Microsoft now claims that their Internet Explorer
<BR>
browser is part of the operating system.  When you see statistics about the
<BR>
number of IE users, be aware that this counts all Windows systems as being
<BR>
IE users.  There is no way that Netscape could outnumber the number of
<BR>
Windows OSes sold.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The ability to deliberately break competing software via changes to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; system confers advantage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe a small tactical advantage, as long as you don't do it very often.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Microsoft also has a habit of reinterpretting standards such that their
<BR>
customer's files only work with Microsoft and not with competitors.  For
<BR>
example, webpage style sheets require that sizing measurements always have
<BR>
units (pixels, ems, inches, centimeters, something) on them.  The standards
<BR>
specificallly state that measurements without units are supposed to be
<BR>
ignored.  Microsoft's program produce all their measurements without units.
<BR>
These are magically interpretted by Microsoft products, but are correctly
<BR>
ignored by other vendors.  The result is that these broken pages work only
<BR>
with Microsoft products and no one else.
<BR>
<P>Now, before anyone claims that I am anti-Microsoft, you should know that I
<BR>
choose to use my Windows 95 PC over my Macintosh, and I choose to run the
<BR>
Microsoft Internet Explorer browser over my Netscape browser.  I use all
<BR>
these products extensively for different purpose, including testing my web
<BR>
pages, so I am not tied to one or the other.  (I also have SunOS, AIX and
<BR>
Linux Unixes running.)
<BR>
<P>I don't want the government interfering with the free market or with any
<BR>
technical decisions in the computer industry.  But I also get tired of
<BR>
people saying that there is a government plot against Microsoft.  There is
<BR>
no evil conpiracy theory.  The fact is that Microsoft has played some pretty
<BR>
obnoxious games to trample the competition.  While they may not have been
<BR>
illegal, they certainly seem to go against the free-market method of
<BR>
choosing the best product.  Many government officials believe that Microsoft
<BR>
has crossed the legal line.  (And getting caught faking their evidence in
<BR>
court didn't help their case either!)
