<P><EM>&gt; In the April 28 issue of &quot;Science&quot; ,the one about the improvement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in cloning technology, I found the following two paragraphs, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem important to me, I'd like somebody to tell me why I'm wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>John, its a rare day when you are &quot;wrong&quot;... :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot; Another sign that the cloning process had somehow turned back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the clock on the animals' cells came when the team cultured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    fibroblasts, a type of connective tissue cell, from the calves' ears.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The cells expressed high levels of a gene called EPC-1, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    typically found at high levels in young cells and may be involved in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    cell division and proliferation.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An imperial result independent of telomeres that seems to indicate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cells really are more youthful, or rather act more youthfully.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have absolutely no problem with the fact that they have increased
<BR>
telomere length and maybe even have (accidentally) flipped a switch
<BR>
favoring the maintenence and repair common in &quot;youth&quot; over the diversion
<BR>
of resources into reproduction (common in early adults).
<BR>
<P>However, that is a *far cry* from keeping alive an organism
<BR>
over many years (where background radiation plays a significant
<BR>
hazard).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;In a related experiment, the team cloned five calf fetuses from adult cells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   kept in culture until senescence. They removed the fetuses at 6 weeks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   of gestation so they could compare their cells with those of normal fetal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   calves. The clones' cells divided an average of 93 times compared to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   only 61 for cells from normal calves. If this increased life-span extends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   to the whole animal, Lanes says, there is &quot;a real possibility&quot; that cloned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   animals might live as much as 50% longer than their normal counterparts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   --up to 180 to 200 years in the case of humans--an idea, he says, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &quot;is going to raise an eyebrow or two.&quot;&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's even more direct evidence. I grant you it still doesn't prove the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entire animal will live longer but it does give considerable weight to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that idea; and a increase from 61 to 93 divisions is not small and is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theoretical, it's a concrete experimental result.
</EM><BR>
<P>No argument.  So I'll live to 150 with skin cells that are &quot;pretty&quot;
<BR>
(execpt where they are malignant), and with intestinal and stomach
<BR>
cells that are &quot;pretty&quot; (except where they are malignant) and with
<BR>
a very robust immune system (except where they are malignant).
<BR>
<P>Ever since Fossil's book, everyone has thought that &quot;aging&quot; is
<BR>
associated with telomere shortening and quite simply that is crap.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I know Robert Bradbury has expressed some contempt for this work but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I confess I just don't understand why. Perhaps the effect was caused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because the telomeres got longer, perhaps it was caused by something else,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but whatever the reason the result if true is pretty damn interesting.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And I happen to think it probably is true, I mean It's not like the report
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; came out of The National Enquirer, &quot;Science  along with &quot;Nature&quot; are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two most respected science journals in the world.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that the journals are reputable and the experimental results
<BR>
are valid (with the caveats previously mentioned).
<BR>
<P>When you look at aging, the way to look at it is *What makes people die?&quot;*.
<BR>
The #1 cause of death is heart disease followed by cancer.  Heart disease
<BR>
is usually an &quot;overproliferation&quot; disease (too many platelets or endothelial
<BR>
cells causing clots), as is cancer.  The &quot;underproliferation&quot; diseases
<BR>
(such as poor nutritional absorption in the oldest-old due to a failure
<BR>
of cell division in the gut) are a distinct minority.  Stroke, is also
<BR>
sometimes an &quot;underproliferation&quot; disease as cells at &quot;high stress points&quot;
<BR>
in the arteries wear out their telomeres, cease division, eventually become
<BR>
senescent, and presumably die or fail to maintain structural integrity
<BR>
in the long term.
<BR>
<P>The essence of longevity in humans is for cells to divide enough
<BR>
in situations where replacements are needed and to never divide
<BR>
where local functions are sufficient.
<BR>
<P>So I view any solution that lengthens telomeres, particularly
<BR>
without knowing the underlying mutational load that has been
<BR>
incorporated into the genome as a very mixed blessing, 
<BR>
