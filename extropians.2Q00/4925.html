<P><EM>&gt; A few years ago they claimed to have solved the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem and had a successful test, but much later it turned out that they'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installed a electric heater on the mock warhead so it gave off a much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stronger infrared signal.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right.  That test, the Homing Overlay Experiment, was a test
<BR>
of the kill vehicle, not the seeker.  The seeker technology was
<BR>
not advanced enough at that time, so they, the customer and
<BR>
the contractors, decided not to risk the kill vehicle test by
<BR>
combining it with a seeker test.  Later a reporter without
<BR>
a clearance felt he had uncovered some kind of scandal or
<BR>
cover-up upon learning of the &quot;hidden electric heater&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The latest round of testing is no more honest a inside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; informant told the New York Times on Friday.
</EM><BR>
<P>Inside informant.  How would the Times know if they had
<BR>
a *real* inside informant?  If the inside informant had a clearance,
<BR>
they would risk going to prison for leaking info.  Why would
<BR>
that inside informant do that?  What if the informant had a
<BR>
clearance, but not in that particular area?  This is an inherent
<BR>
problem with reporter digging up a scoop within the cutting
<BR>
edge of defense:  those who know do not tell.  Therefore those
<BR>
who tell ________.    Fill in the blank.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With realistic decoys the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system had absolutely no luck finding the warhead so they just dumbed down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; testing.
</EM><BR>
<P>So goes the story.  In fact I would not expect they would combine
<BR>
a test of decoy discrimination with a kill vehicle test.  Reason: decoy
<BR>
discrimination can be tested on the deck, in an anechoic chamber.
<BR>
If they felt it necessary to do such a test in space, the results would be
<BR>
highly secret, for obvious reasons, and there might even be intentional
<BR>
misinformation leaked to the press.   The customer would never want
<BR>
such a test to be combined with a test that cannot be kept secret,
<BR>
such as a hit-to-kill intercept, which cannot be kept secret.  A space-
<BR>
based decoy test can be launched from a sounding rocket out in
<BR>
Nevada somewhere, where no one is watching.  Keep in mind that
<BR>
the results of these tests have convinced those who pay the bills that
<BR>
this technology is worth pursuing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think it's a screwy idea. It would never work against a massive attack because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defense will always be more expensive than offence,
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.  I agree.  However, the comparison is irrelevant.  For
<BR>
instance, the cost of the lock on your car is much higher than the
<BR>
cost of the tool used to defeat it, yet still we lock our cars.  The
<BR>
cost of the lock on our houses is very high with respect to the
<BR>
cost of the brick thrown thru a window.  The costs that should
<BR>
be compared is the cost of the defense compared to the cost of...
<BR>
Seattle.
<BR>
<P>Or Los Angeles, or New York.  Name a city, and please
<BR>
help me estimate its value.  How would you do it?  Assume the
<BR>
value of all the real estate, then add the number of people times
<BR>
their average annual salary times the average remaining years
<BR>
of their career?  Then add a few bucks apiece for the children?
<BR>
John, what is the *value* of the city you live in?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; well if I were an insane dictator of some little jerkwater country I wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use ICBM's to deliver my bombs, they're harder to make than nukes and much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expensive; I'd use FedEx or UPS to deliver my H Bomb,
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.  But before this becomes much greater of a risk, we
<BR>
need the technology to determine if any given package contains
<BR>
fissionable material, which is actually now doable, with thermal
<BR>
neutron detectors and other technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; a rocket can be tracked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so everyone would know who was responsible for having Manhattan vaporized,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; America might be irritated at me.
</EM><BR>
<P>That they would.  In fact, if some Dr. Evil fired a missile at
<BR>
the U.S. he would likely never get the satisfaction of knowing
<BR>
whether or not it made it thru the defenses, since an advanced
<BR>
adversary has countermeasures aboard submarines, which are
<BR>
likely closer to him than he is to the U.S.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Better if things just go boom and nobody knows why.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I could even send a letter of condolence afterwards.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, yes, do that.  Now of course, you have raised an issue that
<BR>
leads directly back to our favorite old topic: universal surveillance.
<BR>
I want someone to explain to me how we can possibly go another
<BR>
100 years without some form of national missile defense and
<BR>
eventually some form of unisurv, one that cares not if it sees you
<BR>
scratching your fanny but rather is focussed on those who try to
<BR>
make nukes, bioagents or nanoweapons.  spike
