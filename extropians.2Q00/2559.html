<EM>&gt;  Oh, I agree completely. But please do not exempt Gould from the category of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinkers whose theories are made to fit the social ramifications they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prefer. Gould's scientific work is not generally held in high regard by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other paleontologists. His trendy politics are another story. Since, as he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; once said in an interview, he &quot;learned [his] Marxism at [his] father's knee&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many people -- although I would hope few on THIS list! -- are willing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overlook the weakness of his theories.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Yes, of course, and I think he is aware of the particular foibles which 
<BR>
plague his opinions, if not empowered to change them. I am not sure that I 
<BR>
understand how his theories are weakened by his dad; Marxism has little to do 
<BR>
with the land snails, or slugs or whatever he studies. Whether I am on THIS 
<BR>
list or any other, regarding his politics: I have no problem with tolerating 
<BR>
other people's viewpoints, nor his Jewish/Atheist/Liberal persona. 
<BR>
<P>The book I am speaking of is called &quot;The Mismeasure of Man' . It is not 
<BR>
theoretical, or scientific... it's just a rare historical view, documenting 
<BR>
(somewhat humorously) various (at the time highly respectable, though now 
<BR>
laughable) scientific experiments in which race and genetics were analyzed to 
<BR>
account for certain hegemonous nationalists to posit that they deserve a 
<BR>
biologically &quot;superior&quot; intelligence over other races. Phrenology for 
<BR>
instance. It is amusing.
