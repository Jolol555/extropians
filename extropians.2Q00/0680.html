<P><EM>&gt; &gt; And another thing.... we already put minimum sentences on lots of crimes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I sure as hell wouldn't want someone convicted of murder to get a sentence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that is part suspended and the rest as 'time served'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem with mandatory minimums is that it encourages plea-bargaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and dishonesty in the system.  Guilt or innocence for a crime should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a matter of determining whether the facts meet the elements of the crime,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and nothing more.  The judge then should have the ability to exercise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some judgment about what remedy is appropriate under the circumstances.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A wife who has been habitually abused for years, for example, may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decide to take some &quot;burning bed&quot; action that would technically meet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the elements of a charge of premeditated murder, but I would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consider her a threat to society, and would not care to second-guess a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; judge who deliberated on the issue and chose to give her time served.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Deciding who did what should be a matter of facts and evidence;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deciding the interests of justice are, and should be, a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human judgment that simply cannot be inflexibly legislated.  I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encouraged a bit by a recent ruling finding that California's &quot;three
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strikes&quot; law unconstitutionally usurps the power of the judiciary,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I'm afraid that ruling doesn't apply to mandatory sentences in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general.
</EM><BR>
<P>I understand what you are saying Lee, however considering the number of lenient
<BR>
judges we've seen in the judiciary (and those entering the judiciary now. If how
<BR>
many baby boomers treat their kids is any indication, they are gonna be useless
<BR>
judges) Judges need to know that there are minimum acceptable standards for
<BR>
crimes. Your burning bed example above would and should involve mitigating
<BR>
circumstances, and judges should be able to allow for mitigating circumstances.
<BR>
Too many treat the minimums as an average, though, rather than seeing it as a
<BR>
reward for mitigating circumstances. If the minimum is 5 years and the max is 10
<BR>
years, then the bell curve on a judges convictions for that offense had better
<BR>
peak out at 7.5 years. Seeing a judge impose the minimum on 90% of his cases
<BR>
indicates incompetence to me
