<EM>&gt; Mike, why is that??  Is it some sort of paperwork hassle for the cop?

<P><P>In some states, a CCW is a &quot;certified good guy&quot; card and cops are extra
<BR>
lenient to those that carry them, because there is a presumption that any
<BR>
&quot;crimes&quot; committed by the holder are without criminal intent.  
<BR>
<P>The CCW holder, having usually gone through a relatively extensive
<BR>
background check at the local and federal levels, is often treated
<BR>
differently legally as well.  For example, in Nevada (where I happen to
<BR>
have a CCW), many state felonies are automatically reduced to misdemeanors
<BR>
if you have a CCW.  Again, the idea is that a person who has maintained a
<BR>
clean criminal record for this much of their life is unlikely to
<BR>
intentionally commit a crime in the future.
<BR>
<P>When you consider that, statistically, cops are several times more likely
<BR>
to commit felonies than CCW holders, this makes a reasonable amount of
<BR>
sense. As a statistical group, CCW holders are among the least likely
<BR>
individuals to commit a crime in this country (orders of magnitude
<BR>
below the general population), hence the special treatment.
