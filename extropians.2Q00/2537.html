<EM>&gt; I hear they can do that across the street in Vermont now.  {8^D

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BTW, lets hear it for Vermont!  Live Free or Die!

<EM>&gt; Ive always wondered about that saying as a motorcyclist.  Vermont
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has no helmet laws, one of the last states to have none.  Consequently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you ride in Vermont, you need not choose between live free or die.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can do both!  {8-]

<EM>&gt; What say ye, Mike?  spike

<P>Well, I had predicted that the legislature would wind up coming to just
<BR>
this compromise, where gays, as well as family members, can obtain
<BR>
'civil union' recognition, but that civil unions are not, in fact,
<BR>
marriages. I'm actually surprised that nobody has been making cracks
<BR>
about this as a form of legalizing incest, that there must be a lot of
<BR>
brothers and sisters or fathers and daughters living together if this is
<BR>
such an important thing, etc...it is, after all, Vermont. Not quite West
<BR>
Virginia, but pretty close... ;)
<BR>
<P>Vermont and NH reflect a pretty good example of the minor differences
<BR>
between anarcho-socialists and anarcho-capitalists, though NH is
<BR>
beginning to suffer from political osmosis from Massachusetts. People
<BR>
move up here to get away from taxes and how bad things are down there,
<BR>
but then try to turn NH into the same sort of wasteland they escaped
<BR>
from. Those that escape to Vermont from New York are following a
<BR>
slightly different strategy, once they've gotten to Vermont, they then
<BR>
lobby to close the door tighter against other people coming in, but at
<BR>
the same time they are squeezing the traditional Vermonter out as
<BR>
well... You can basically say that the Vermont Legislature is the New
<BR>
York Liberal Government-in-Exile on many issues, trying to make Vermont
<BR>
the gated community of the northeast.
<BR>
<P>Yeah, Vermont doesn't require helmets, but they do require seat belts.
<BR>
NH does require helmets but doesn't require seatbelts for adults.
<BR>
Vermont does require car insurance for everyone, NH only requires it for
<BR>
DWI convicts and people who have caused an accident causing over x
<BR>
dollars in damages. Vermont doesn't require any permit to carry a
<BR>
concealed weapon (but no other states recognise a Vermonter's right to
<BR>
carry reciprocally) while NH requires a permit, but they are required to
<BR>
issue it within 14 days if you are not a felon, and at least a half
<BR>
dozen states reciprocate (because its not a discretionary permit,
<BR>
because its locally issued, not by the state, and because its not a
<BR>
permit with a photo, even though the permit with your drivers license is
<BR>
supposed to be sufficient corroboration, many states insiste on at least
<BR>
one of these conditions to reciprocate). NH does have an
<BR>
anti-discrimination law that recognises gays equal rights, and they are
<BR>
equally free to marry a member of the opposite sex whenever they want
<BR>
to, just as I am.
