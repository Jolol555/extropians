3. MEDICAL BIOLOGY:
<BR>
MISREGULATION OF MITOSIS AND HUMAN AGING
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea that human aging is controlled by genes is not the
<BR>
end but the beginning of research: Does the aging process involve
<BR>
one gene, or a fixed group of specific genes, or groups of
<BR>
various genes at different times and in different individuals?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;messenger RNA&quot; refers to the ribonucleic acid
<BR>
molecule transcribed from DNA that carries the coded information
<BR>
specifying the sequence of amino acids in a protein. Since the
<BR>
various messenger RNAs present in any cell can be isolated and
<BR>
identified, the population of present messenger RNAs can be used
<BR>
to establish a profile of the active genes of that cell.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fibroblasts are a type of connective tissue cell secreting
<BR>
structural proteins such as collagen, the proteins forming a
<BR>
matrix in which the fibroblasts become embedded. These cells can
<BR>
be easily obtained from skin, and they can be easily cultured
<BR>
outside the body.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progeria (Hutchinson-Gilford disease; Hutchinson-Gilford
<BR>
syndrome; premature senility syndrome) is a condition of
<BR>
precocious aging, with onset at birth or early childhood, the
<BR>
condition characterized by growth retardation, a senile
<BR>
appearance with dry wrinkled skin, early occurrence of
<BR>
*atherosclerosis in blood vessels, and premature death (usually
<BR>
before the age of 20) due to coronary artery disease. The disease
<BR>
is apparently genetic, but the details of the etiology are not
<BR>
clear.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the term &quot;phenotype&quot; refers to the specific
<BR>
individuality of an organism as determined by the interaction
<BR>
during development between its genetic constitution (genotype)
<BR>
and the environment.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the term &quot;mitosis&quot; refers to the entire
<BR>
cell division phase of the cell cycle, with &quot;cell cycle&quot;
<BR>
referring to the entire life history of a single cell from
<BR>
mitosis to mitosis, including the sequence of intervening phases.
<BR>
In this context, the term &quot;postmitotic cells&quot; refers to cells
<BR>
that normally do not undergo mitosis once they have fully
<BR>
differentiated (e.g., neurons and muscle cells).
<BR>
... ... D.H. Ly et al (4 authors at 2 installations, US) report
<BR>
an analysis of aging correlates in human genetic profiles, the
<BR>
authors making the following points:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The authors measured messenger RNA levels in actively
<BR>
dividing fibroblasts isolated from young, middle-age, and old-age
<BR>
humans and humans with progeria. Messenger RNA levels were
<BR>
analyzed with high-density *oligonucleotide arrays containing
<BR>
probes for more than 6000 known human genes.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The authors report their results suggest that an altered
<BR>
expression profile of genes involved in mitosis occurs with age,
<BR>
and that these changes result in increased rates of *somatic
<BR>
mutation, leading to numerical and structural *chromosome
<BR>
aberrations and mutations that manifest themselves as an aging
<BR>
phenotype.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The authors suggest that these chromosome pathologies,
<BR>
which begin to occur in dividing cells relatively early in life
<BR>
(but in the postreproductive stage), may lead to misregulation of
<BR>
key structural, signaling, and metabolic genes associated with
<BR>
the aging phenotype, such as the apparent misregulations
<BR>
characteristic of *osteoporosis, *Alzheimer's disease,
<BR>
*arthritis, etc. Misregulation of this sort is expected to
<BR>
increase in each round of cell division, and it may be propagated
<BR>
to other normal mitotic cells (e.g., *leukocytes, *epithelial
<BR>
cells, *glial cells, etc.) and postmitotic cells (e.g., neurons,
<BR>
muscles, etc.) through changes in the *extracellular matrix and
<BR>
oxidized fatty acid derivatives that affect signaling pathways.
<BR>
Aging, the authors suggest, may therefore occur gradually and in
<BR>
mosaic patterns, rather than as a uniform phenomenon
<BR>
characteristic of cancerous growth (which is clonal -- deriving
<BR>
from a single mutated progenitor cell)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) The authors conclude: &quot;Additional studies are required
<BR>
before we can understand the aging process in complex organisms,
<BR>
both in mitotic and postmitotic tissue, but the studies reported
<BR>
here highlight important mechanisms that may contribute to aging
<BR>
and age-related problems.&quot;

... ... *atherosclerosis: &quot;Arteriosclerosis&quot; is a generic term
<BR>
for several diseases in which the arterial wall becomes thickened
<BR>
and loses elasticity, and &quot;atherosclerosis&quot; is a form of
<BR>
arteriosclerosis characterized by patchy thickening (atheroma) in
<BR>
the subintimal layer (i.e., immediately below the innermost layer
<BR>
[intima]) of medium and large arteries, the thickening capable of
<BR>
reducing or obstructing blood flow.
<BR>
... ... *oligonucleotide arrays: (DNA microarrays) DNA
<BR>
microarrays are chips containing hundreds or thousands of gene
<BR>
snippets laid out in precise arrays that provide rapid snapshots
<BR>
of the expression of whole suites of genes. The general method in
<BR>
microarray analysis is to a) isolate messenger RNAs (mRNAs)
<BR>
produced by a genome; b) convert mRNA into complementary DNA
<BR>
(cDNA); c) add a fluorescent tag to the cDNA for tracking
<BR>
purposes; d) wash a solution of tagged cDNAs over a DNA
<BR>
microarray chip. Each DNA snippet on the chip will bind the cDNA
<BR>
from the corresponding gene, and by measuring the fluorescences
<BR>
arrayed on the chip, the profile of gene expression is revealed. 
<BR>
... ... *somatic mutation: In general, a mutation occurring in

bone density (bone mass per unit volume) that causes skeletal

weakness. The ratio of mineral to organic elements is unchanged.

fractures resulting from a reduction below the fracture threshold
<BR>
of the amount of bone available for mechanical support.

produced by various causes. Alzheimer-type dementia (Alzheimer's

cellular and histological degenerative processes, with loss of

cells from several specific brain areas, the brain showing

moderate to marked atrophy. Memory loss is the most prominent
<BR>
early symptom.
<BR>
... ... *arthritis: In general, inflammation of a joint or a
<BR>
state characterized by inflammation of joints.
<BR>
... ... *leukocytes: White blood cells, of which there are

various types.
<BR>
... ... *epithelial cells: In animals, &quot;epithelial cells&quot; compose
<BR>
the cell layers that form the interface between a tissue and the
<BR>
external environment, for example, the cells of the skin, the

lining of the intestinal tract, and the lung airway passages.

matrix is a layer consisting mainly of proteins and

ON NEW APPROACHES TO HUMAN AGING
<BR>
It is probably safe to say that research on the biological basis
<BR>
of human aging will remain a central interest in the sciences as
<BR>
long as there is any research at all. However, despite the
<BR>
general public attention to the subject, it is only during the
<BR>
past few decades that cell biologists have begun a vigorous
<BR>
attempt to understand the aging process. A major reason for this
<BR>
is that the new knowledge provided during the past 40 years by
<BR>
molecular biology concerning fundamental cellular processes
<BR>
suggests that an understanding of the biological basis of human
<BR>
aging is indeed possible. The cell biologist Leonard Hayflick
<BR>
(University of California San Francisco, US) first demonstrated
<BR>
in the 1960s that the mortality of biological cells is either
<BR>
directly or indirectly programmed in each cell, and that this is
<BR>
an important aspect of the aging of human tissues (see related
<BR>
background material below). Hayflick now presents a provocative
<BR>
essay on the subject, the author making the following points:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The author points out that in the past 100 years life
<BR>
expectancy at birth in developed countries has increased from
<BR>
approximately 48 years to 76 years, the same gain that occurred
<BR>
over the previous 1900 years. But this progress has neither
<BR>
advanced nor resulted from our understanding of aging. Instead,
<BR>
it is the control of infectious diseases of the young that
<BR>
explains the increase in life expectancy during the 20th century.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The author suggests that the failure to distinguish
<BR>
between the diseases of old age and the aging process is
<BR>
widespread even in the scientific community. The virtual
<BR>
resolution of various childhood diseases such as poliomyelitis
<BR>
and iron-deficiency anemia did not increase our knowledge of
<BR>
childhood development. Similarly, the resolution of the leading
<BR>
causes of death in old age -- cardiovascular disease, stroke, and
<BR>
cancer -- are unlikely to advance our knowledge of the aging
<BR>
process.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The author suggests that one example of the consequences
<BR>
for science policy of the failure to distinguish research on age-
<BR>
associated diseases from research on the fundamental biology of
<BR>
aging is that &quot;it is virtually impossible to raise funds for
<BR>
research on aging, because in the minds of policy-makers and the
<BR>
public no one suffers or dies from it.&quot; More than half of the
<BR>
budget of the US National Institute on Aging is spent on
<BR>
Alzheimer's disease, yet the elimination of this disease &quot;will
<BR>
have only a trivial impact on life expectancy and will not
<BR>
advance our knowledge of the fundamental biology of aging.&quot; The
<BR>
author suggests that greater attention must be given to a
<BR>
question that is rarely posed: Why are old cells more vulnerable
<BR>
to disease than young cells?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) The author concludes: &quot;The resolution of all causes of
<BR>
death currently written on the death certificates of those older
<BR>
than 65 will result in an increase in life expectancy of only
<BR>
about 15 years. An increase in our knowledge of how age changes
<BR>
occur does not put a 15-year limit on what is possible.&quot;

CELLULAR AGING: DONOR AGE AND CELLULAR REPLICATION LIFESPAN
<BR>
Fibroblasts are a type of connective tissue cell, secreting
<BR>
structural proteins such as collagen, the proteins forming a
<BR>
matrix in which the fibroblasts become embedded. These cells can
<BR>
be easily obtained from skin, and they can be easily cultured
<BR>
outside the body. Normal human fibroblasts have a finite
<BR>
replicative lifespan in vitro (i.e., they divide a finite number
<BR>
of times), and this has been postulated to be a cellular
<BR>
manifestation of aging of the human organism. Several studies
<BR>
have indeed shown an inverse relationship between donor age (the
<BR>
age of the persons from which cultured cells are derived) and
<BR>
fibroblast culture replicative lifespan. But in all cases the
<BR>
correlation was weak, and with few exceptions the health status
<BR>
of the donors was unknown. Thus, the relationship between the
<BR>
replicative lifespan and the age of the donor from which the
<BR>
cells are derived has remained equivocal (*Note #1).
<BR>
... ... V.J. Cristofalo et al (5 authors at 2 installations, US)
<BR>
now report a study of the replicative lifespan of 124 skin
<BR>
fibroblast cell lines established from donors of different ages.
<BR>
All donors were medically examined and were declared &quot;healthy&quot;
<BR>
(according to Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging protocols) at
<BR>
the time the biopsies were taken. The authors report that both
<BR>
long- and short-lived cell lines were observed in all age groups,
<BR>
but no significant correlation between the proliferative
<BR>
potential of the cell lines and donor age was found. A comparison
<BR>
of multiple cell lines established from the same donors at
<BR>
different ages also failed to reveal any significant trends
<BR>
between proliferative potential and donor age. The authors
<BR>
suggest their results clearly indicate that if health status and
<BR>
biopsy conditions are controlled, the replicative lifespan of
<BR>
fibroblasts in culture does not correlate with donor age.

Text Notes:
<BR>
... ... *Note #1: The possibility that the process of cell aging
<BR>
and death is under genetic control was first suggested by Leonard
<BR>
Hayflick in 1961. Hayflick reported that normal human fibroblasts
<BR>
apparently have an intrinsic limit to the number of times they
<BR>
can proliferate, with human fibroblasts removed from an embryo
<BR>
and grown in culture dividing approximately 50 times before they
<BR>
deteriorate and die. In contrast, human fibroblasts removed from
<BR>
adults multiply only 15 to 30 times before dying. Also,
<BR>
fibroblasts removed from young children suffering from Werner's
<BR>
syndrome (a rare disease that causes premature aging) divide only
<BR>
2 to 10 times in culture. Further evidence for a relationship
<BR>
between aging and the replicative capacity of cells was provided
<BR>
by the discovery that the number of replications in culture is
<BR>
apparently related to the lifespan of organism. For example,
<BR>
cultured cells of the Galapagos tortoise, whose maximum life span
<BR>
is approximately 175 years, divide more than 100 times in
<BR>
culture, whereas cells from the mouse, whose maximum life
<BR>
expectancy is only a few years, divide fewer than 30 times in
<BR>
culture. The correlation roughly holds for other species as well.

BIOLOGY OF AGING: ON TELOMERES AND REPLICATIVE SENESCENCE
<BR>
Telomeres are defined ends of chromosomes that contain specific
<BR>
repeated DNA sequences. They are essential for normal chromosome
<BR>
replication, and since their length shortens a bit with each
<BR>
replication, they are believed to be involved in the aging of the
<BR>
cell. Telomerase is an enzyme that repairs damage to telomeres,
<BR>
and it is thought by some that cancerous cells may have mutant
<BR>
telomerase, the mutant enzyme conferring immortality on the
<BR>
cancer cell. ... ... In a review of cell senescence, the aging of
<BR>
cell cultures, and the immortalization of mammalian cells, John
<BR>
M. Sedivy (Brown University, US) makes the following points: 1)
<BR>
Finite replicative lifespan (senescence) of mammalian cells in
<BR>
culture is a phenomenon that has generated much curiosity since
<BR>
its description. The obvious significance of senescence to
<BR>
organismal aging and the development of cancer has engendered a
<BR>
long-lasting and lively debate about its mechanisms. 2) Three
<BR>
classical observations are usually cited to argue that in vitro
<BR>
replicative senescence is a phenomenon with biological
<BR>
significance: a) the correlation of in vitro lifespan with the
<BR>
age of the donor; b) the correlation of in vitro lifespan with
<BR>
the average life expectancy of species; and, c) the reduced in
<BR>
vitro lifespan of cells from patients afflicted with premature
<BR>
aging syndromes. 3) Two major theories have been used to explain
<BR>
limited replicative capacity. The first hypothesis invokes the
<BR>
gradual accumulation of mutations, and the second hypothesis
<BR>
invokes the existence of a molecular clock (or clocks) that can
<BR>
keep track of cell divisions. The second theory is now believed
<BR>
to be generally true. 4) It is known that cell senescence can be
<BR>
overcome, because many cell lines in common laboratory use are
<BR>
quite obviously immortal. Rodent cells can overcome senescence
<BR>
spontaneously. Human, chicken, bovine, and horse cells rarely, if
<BR>
ever, immortalize spontaneously. 5) Certain viral or biochemical
<BR>
interventions in human cell cultures can overcome cell
<BR>
senescence, typically by causing 20 to 30 extra population
<BR>
doublings. At the end of this extended lifespan, there is a
<BR>
decline and death of the culture in 4 to 6 weeks, which has been
<BR>
termed &quot;crisis&quot;. Senescent cells, on the other hand, can be
<BR>
maintained in vitro in a viable non-proliferative state for very
<BR>
long periods of time (reports of from 4 to 6 months, and up to 2
<BR>
years). 6) The author suggests it is amazing that in spite of
<BR>
very long periods of apparent &quot;immortality&quot;, the senescent
<BR>
program in cells remains intact in cells in which senescence has
<BR>
been overridden, so that on removal of the overriding agent, the
<BR>
program is capable of establishing rapid growth arrest. 7) The
<BR>
current prevailing hypothesis for the nature of the molecular
<BR>
clock involved in cell senescence is the attrition of telomeres.
<BR>
*Germ cells, and some key *stem cells, are known to express
<BR>
telomerase catalytic activity, whereas the majority of somatic
<BR>
cells lack it. Murine (mouse) embryonic stem cells express
<BR>
telomerase and are functionally immortal, and elimination of
<BR>
telomerase eventually results in loss of proliferation. 8) The
<BR>
author proposes that immortalization of human cells requires a
<BR>
bypass of both cell senescence and crisis, whereas in rodent
<BR>
cells cell crisis does not exist and culture lifespan is limited
<BR>
only by senescence. 9) Evidence indicates that, at least in human
<BR>
cells, telomere length appears to be linked critically to the
<BR>
triggering of senescence. The author suggests that although it
<BR>
remains to be rigorously demonstrated, this strongly implies that
<BR>
activation of telomerase can result in one-step immortalization.
<BR>
In conclusion, the author states the two most significant
<BR>
questions in this field: a) Does cell senescence limit organismal
<BR>
lifespan? And, b) Is telomerase expression necessary for cancer
<BR>
progression in vivo?
