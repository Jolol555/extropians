<P>The rest of your post seemed valid but this paragraph surprised me. I doubt 
<BR>
that the IRA are able to out gun the SAS in the context of fighting an 
<BR>
equivalent battle. The IRA are regarded as terrorists and so will be fought 
<BR>
within the rule of appropriate law.
<BR>
<P>If Britain were to regard the IRA as a legitimate army, I'm sure a lot of 
<BR>
them would die, very rapidly, most likely with a fair ammount of collateral 
<BR>
damage (to use that odious phrase).
<BR>
<P>However, within British law, they're regarded as an in-between (terrorists) 
<BR>
which means that various normal criminal/human rights are waivered. 
<BR>
However, they cannot be killed/attacked in an offensive manner, well at a 
<BR>
public level, that is. At a covert level, it sometimes appears to be a 
<BR>
different story, but only the govnerment/spooks/victims know the true story 
<BR>
there.
<BR>
<P>In Britain, everyone I've ever met wants peace. But start discussing the 
<BR>
detail and the viewpoints diverge dramatically.
<BR>
<P>regards,
