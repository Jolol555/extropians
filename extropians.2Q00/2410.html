<BR>

<BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmm.  I had not considered that.  If that is what Eugene had in mind, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't suppose I could argue with that.  I find it difficult to imagine a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replica of me that is exact in every way, yet still not having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness.  But if it could somehow be done, and the copy was
</EM><BR>
terminated
<BR>
<EM>&gt; before the last step of igniting the consciousness, then moral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ly I don't suppose I'd have a problem with that.  Although I still believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that would raise a sticky *ethical* issue.
</EM><BR>
<P>To keep the record straight, I don't think Eugene agreed with my
<BR>
interpretation.  But in my mind, if the copy is still being artificially
<BR>
caused to have the same thoughts as the original, instead of being allowed
<BR>
to directly experience the world and generate its own thoughts, then I would
<BR>
not consider it conscious yet.  I would think that the process of
<BR>
artificially causing it to keep in synch with the original was part of the
<BR>
original creation/copying process.  As soon as it is disconnected from
<BR>
machinery that control its sensory input to match the original's, and it
<BR>
starts perceiving the world from its own viewpoint, then it becomes
<BR>
independently conscious in my opinion.
<BR>
<P>I believe that Eugene's &quot;copy&quot; must be kept in synch with the original, or
<BR>
else he no longer considers it to be an identical copy.  I don't think he
<BR>
believe in killing a copy as soon as it has had its first independent
<BR>
thought.  In this sense, I am not sure that different participants really
<BR>
disagree on when a copy can be killed and when it becomes an independent
<BR>
being who should not be killed.
