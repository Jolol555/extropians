<EM>&gt; Set aside Joy's disappointingly juvenile views on political economy (lifted 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; straight out of Dickinson) and his muddled thinking about how some collective 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;we&quot; chooses the shape of the world (ignoring Arrow's Theorem).
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert Bradbury replied:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Arrow's Theorem&quot;?  Ref by any chance?
</EM><BR>
<P>Type &quot;Arrow's Theorem&quot; into any search engine and you will find many
<BR>
references.
<BR>
<P>By itself the theorem is strictly about the impossibility of constructing
<BR>
a voting system that satisfies seemingly reasonable principles of
<BR>
fairness.  However its philosophical implications go beyond this,
<BR>
just as the unsolvability of the halting problem has implications in
<BR>
computer science and philosophy beyond the bare question of predicting
<BR>
which computer programs will keep running.
<BR>
<P>The more general lesson is that it is impossible to create a fair and
<BR>
reasonable society.  Even an omniscient, omnipotent being cannot create
<BR>
a world which satisfies the most basic postulates of fairness, at least
<BR>
not without turning everyone into some kind of zombie.  Any time you
<BR>
have mutually exclusive choices, there is no way of deciding without
<BR>
making someone unhappy in a way that is arguably unfair.  It's tough,
<BR>
but that's how the world is.
<BR>
<P>I think what Tom is saying is that we as a society can't choose the kind
<BR>
of ideal world Joy might like to see, because there is no choice algorithm
<BR>
that works well.  We are stuck with bad compromises, and someone always
<BR>
gets hurt.
