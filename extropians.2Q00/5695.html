<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The real question is, as the paragraph above says, do these philosophical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; views, followed to their ultimate conclusion by someone with the courage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of his convictions, lead to destructive ends?  I think the answer is, yes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inevitably.  Kaczynski's mail bombs, Joy's call for an end to progress,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the violent activism of environmentalists and creationists alike, all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are part of the same pattern.  If modern technology is harmful, and if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it seduces us onto a path to even greater and more powerful technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which will produce greater harm, then the only way to force people off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this path is by violence.  Technology is too seductive, too attractive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for persuasion to succeed.  Inevitably force must be used.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>There are in history some examples of civilizations which gave up major
<BR>
technologies.  I believe it was China, where gunpowder was invented, where
<BR>
people gave up guns after having them for some time. I can think of a number
<BR>
of less drastic examples, such as when the use of gold as money was outlawed
<BR>
in the US (I'm defining technology maybe more broadly in this case than you,
<BR>
but surely money should count as a technology).
<BR>
<P>Kaczynski certainly seems to want an end to all but the most primitive
<BR>
technologies.  I didn't get the impression from Joy's paper that he's
<BR>
anywhere nearly so radical. I would think that an end to progress would be
<BR>
easier to acheive without widespread violence than destroying existing
<BR>
technology. If you outlaw certain kinds of research, you only have to exert
<BR>
violence or the threat of violence against the small part of the population
<BR>
that would have been engaged in the research. The outlawing of gold as money
<BR>
involved force or threat of force against an entire population.
