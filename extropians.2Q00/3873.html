<P>
First off can you explain to me what the difference is between Isp and
<BR>
Fsp, thanks.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Well I am not a rocket scientist :0 But I can scan in a chart from their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; business plan (or perhaps it is on their old site at nanopropulsion.com)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; showing how their system is waaay better than the shuttle or other methods.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The idea is that the nanoaluminum allows for a much denser mix with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; other materials in the fuel, and therefore much faster reaction rates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and therefore much much higher thrust than what you get from conventional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mixing techniques.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I read through their site, and yes, it does appear that they can make an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end-burning solid motor work well.  Their &quot;specific thrust&quot; figure of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merit merely shows that the end burning is possible- which I grant could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improve solid motor loading density by perhaps 35 to 40 percent, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amount of empty volume normally cast into solid motors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, the simple fact remains that the sea level Isp of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Al/perchlorate/HTPB motors is at best about 260 seconds, while even low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tech pressure fed LOX/kerosene is about 280.  The vacuum performance is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even more strongly in favor of the liquids.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok I am going to verbally describe what I see in their biz plan, you
<BR>
tell me if this makes sense. I am considering the fact that they handed
<BR>
these out indiscriminantly at the conference as making it ok for me
<BR>
to go on about these details :-)
<BR>
<P>First in the marketing section they claim to have validated their
<BR>
orders of magnitude improvement in thrust through something called
<BR>
The Aerospace Corporation. Ever heard of them?
<BR>
<P>In the technology section they show a graph of how in different kinds
<BR>
of explosions (conventional explosions vs. thermite) the reactant
<BR>
diffusion distance is inversely proportional to reaction velocity.
<BR>
Farther away reactants have to move to get to each other, the slower
<BR>
the reaction velocity.
<BR>
<P>They show a picture of a typical chunk of fuel/oxidizer from regular
<BR>
fuel- about 200 microns wide (they relate it to a table salt grain),
<BR>
and then make the claim that whereas in regular fuel this would be
<BR>
a single pair of materials, in their fuel this would contain tens of
<BR>
billions of fuel/oxidizer pairs.
<BR>
<P>Next page is a table showing burn rates and chamber pressures of three
<BR>
technologies: stinger (.33 inch/sec and 1300 psi), boeing delta II
<BR>
(.23 inch/sec and 800 psi), their end burning rocket (6.8 inch/sec and
<BR>
25 psi). Below that is a graph showing Fsp of various rocket types along
<BR>
with their burn rates. What that seems to show is most conventional stuff
<BR>
such as Shuttle SRB, Titan IV, sidewinder are all grouped near each other
<BR>
at around .4 burn rate and .005 specific thrust (psi/psi). Meanwhile
<BR>
they show their caseless motor up close to 8 inch/sec burn rate and a
<BR>
specific thrust of 1. Assuming this graph is correct, what are the
<BR>
consequences? The graph also shows a different version of their system
<BR>
which is apparently not caseless... this would be used in sidewinders
<BR>
and such I guess. This one has multiple points along the graph line,
<BR>
from much slower than the others to about the same point as the caseless.
<BR>
So I guess they are saying they can control the reaction rates pretty
<BR>
well.
<BR>
<P>On the next page they show a cutway pic of a regular solid rocket motor
<BR>
vs an end burning. Both show nozzles. They point out that their motors
<BR>
with the highest specific thrust are nozzleless and sometimes caseless,
<BR>
and they make the claim that a caseless rocket would be capable of SSTO.
<BR>
But no real details on how that would work. :-)
<BR>
<P>Most of this seems to be on the web here if you didn't see it:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.nanopropulsion.com/propulsion_technology/index.html">http://www.nanopropulsion.com/propulsion_technology/index.html</A>
<BR>
<P>In fact after re-reading that page just now it has all this info I
<BR>
am talking about, but presented in a better format.
<BR>
<P>I guess what I would like to know is what impact if any do these Fsp
<BR>
and other numbers above have? Assuming they got caseless, nozzleless,
<BR>
end burning rockets to actually work using such Fsps, would that allow
<BR>
for SSTO?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Also they go on about how this would also allow for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nozzleless rockets that could even consume their casing on the way up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There would be no &quot;hole&quot; in the center of the fuel, it would just burn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at the end. What do you think?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here they are flat-out wrong.  Without a de laval nozzle to efficiently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expand the hot gases to supersonic velocity and collimate the exhaust
</EM><BR>
<P>Well it seems that their reaction rates alone are fast enough to create
<BR>
the supersonic velocities without having to do anything else.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; into a unidirectional flow as opposed to a hemisphere, their Isp will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drop in half.  The only way to get around this would be to use a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; micro-orion method as proposed for laser launchers- detonating a thin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surface on a large area produces very high pressures so that you *can*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get good expansion off a flat plate. (Basically the expansion from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ~50,000 psi to 1 psi takes only a few inches, so that the gases expand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a 1-dimensional manner except near the edge.)  Alas, the nozzleless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; method only works with detonations, so either a gigawatt laser or a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; block of TNT are needed. Deflagrating propellants need not apply...
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting, but what if you were using their super-well-mixed nano
<BR>
aluminium fuel. Could you get an effect like this?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; They seemed to think their biggest problem is that the missle tracking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; systems are unable to handle the higher speeds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, an end-burning solid rocket motor would only have slightly increased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Isp due to more efficient combustion and a small increase in enthalpy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and a longer burn time due to the larger propellant charge.  Software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes would take that incremental change in stride.  Basically, it's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neat hack, but with limited potential.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The one big bad ugly thing is that any sort of disbond or crack in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grain would be even more dangerous than for a center-burning motor.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Titan SRMs have a bad habit of blowing up when the buring area increases
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by a few percent from a crack- imagine how critical propellant integrity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be at 100x the burning rate.  A small void that would make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slower burn rate motor merely hiccup would double the burn rate of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end-burner... instant pretty fireworks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Would this really be a problem if you are burning at the end rather than
<BR>
inside a case with a nozzle? At any rate on the web page I cite above
<BR>
they claim that their fuel has stable burn rates to over 1600 psi.
