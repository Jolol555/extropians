<P><EM>&gt; It is not that hard to believe that the Oracle could be an AI. Remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that these AIs had complete access to the minds of Neo, Trinity, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  while they were in the Matrix growing up. The good AI could have built up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a &quot;copy&quot; of their minds (think uploading via training neural nets that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  are hooked directly into your experiences) that it uses to run simulations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of what their near term actions will be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a far simpler explaination for the Oracles ability. What if the 
<BR>
simulation had already been run before. The out come of all events would 
<BR>
already be know by the matrix and therefor accessable by an extrernal hacker. 
<BR>
Unfortunately the only way this theory holds water is if the escape from the 
<BR>
matrix was also part of the simulation. If not then the Oracle couldn't 
<BR>
accurately predict Neo's actions in the *real world*.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the matrix created the simulation of a distant past for the 
<BR>
humans to live/interact in so it stands to reason that it had the power to 
<BR>
set back the clock and start it again. It must have had the ability to wipe 
<BR>
the memories of the humans, if not there would have been people in the matrix 
<BR>
with memories of the outside world which they would without a doubt have 
<BR>
talked about. Even if enough time had passed that these people had died. 
<BR>
There would still be some record of it. Probably as legends and myths.
<BR>
