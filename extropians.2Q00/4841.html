<P><EM>&gt; implication is that as soon as we use a device, say, fridge, TV, car, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our choices will be uploaded to the Internet and a record will be made of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every detail of our life.  It will be like having an aircraft &quot;black box&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recorder in every device. No hope of any privacy here!

<P>And you know, it wont be as bad as we think.  It never is.  Thousands
<BR>
of mechanical sensors will note how we walk, how we smell, the shape
<BR>
of our faces, and will figure out where everyone is at all times and what
<BR>
we are doing, and yet it will be ok.  People will become special, kind
<BR>
of like gods in a way, will we not?  Our machines will look up to us
<BR>
and respect us and help us.

<P>Just thought I would toss this out to see what happens.  {8-]  spike
