<EM>&gt; Did he waive his right to a speedy trial?

<P>Mike Lorrey replies:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; No, he didn't. Moreover, he was in jail for something like 3 years before he was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even arraigned. They wouldn't let him have access to evidence, or participate in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his defense, and he was refused access to simple electronic devices like phones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and calculators.
</EM><BR>
<P><A HREF="http://cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/mitnick.background/">http://cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/mitnick.background/</A> puts a little different
<BR>
spin on this:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitnick's trial had been delayed several times due its complexity,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and often at the request of the defense.
<BR>
<P>If the defense is requesting delays, that is not consistent with
<BR>
demanding a speedy trial.  The defense doesn't get to drive the whole
<BR>
process, setting the timetable which all parties must follow, for their
<BR>
own convenience.  They can demand a speedy trial and then both sides are
<BR>
handicapped by the rapidity of the proceedings.  But once the defense
<BR>
starts requesting delays, the prosecution gets to do so as well.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randolph tried repeatedly to get Mitnick a computer so he could review
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence that reportedly includes witness statements totaling 1,400
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pages, 10 gigabytes of electronic evidence and 1,700 exhibits in all.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after one hearing, Randolph told reporters that Judge Pfaelzer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;didn't seem to want to hear 'computer' and 'Mitnick' in the same
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sentence.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court ultimately allowed Mitnick access to a laptop, but it was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a room for attorney-client meetings, and he was always monitored by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;someone from Randolph's office. And there was no modem or phone line.
<BR>
<P>So it wasn't that he was denied access to evidence, he was denied access
<BR>
to computers.  From what I read here it implies that if his lawyer had
<BR>
simply printed out the relevant data on paper and carried it in, Mitnick
<BR>
could do whatever he wanted with it.  But the lawyer wasn't allowed to
<BR>
bring in a computer until late in the proceedings.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meanwhile, Mitnick has been serving out a 14-month sentence
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for violating his probation in the Digital break-in and eight months
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a 1995 North Carolina charge of possession of an unauthorized
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;access device.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Kevin's problem is that he has been convicted multiple times,&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said journalist Markoff. &quot;Whatever you think of his crime, he has
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tripped the relevant federal guidelines. And the judge gave him
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a break before. Now he's before her again for another series of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;federal crimes.&quot;
<BR>
<P>He was denied bail, but he was a known flight risk.  He had been a
<BR>
fugitive for three years until Shimomura caught him, and law enforcement
<BR>
couldn't count on the assistance of a top rank computer security expert
<BR>
to catch Mitnick next time.  So I can fully understand the denial of bail.
<BR>
<P>Plus it sounds like two years of his jail time was counted as working
<BR>
off previous sentences.
<BR>
<P>Putting all this together, Mitnick has had a rough ride, but he has
<BR>
brought it on himself.  He violated his probation and he fled from
<BR>
justice despite lenient treatment by the judges in his earlier arrests.
<BR>
Under those conditions no one could not expect kind treatment from the
<BR>
criminal justice system.  At least some of his jail time was owed due
<BR>
to previous convictions, and he himself requested delays in his trial.
<BR>
<P>The judges may have been excessively paranoid in keeping Mitnick away
<BR>
from phones and computers, but these are not technological people and
<BR>
it was hard for them to know what harm Mitnick might accomplish with
<BR>
access to this equipment.  And these limitations do not prevent Mitnick
<BR>
from participating in his defense.  For hundreds of years prisoners have
<BR>
gotten by without computers.
