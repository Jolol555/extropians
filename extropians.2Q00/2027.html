<EM>&gt; Sorry, but his reality is a lot closer than yours.  As a former Microsoft

<EM>&gt; employee involved in O/S work (NT 3.1 in my case), I agree that there was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never any specific intent to hide APIs from application developers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Indeed, Microsoft donated office space in its own building for various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application developers to work with APIs under development.

<P>You really worked on NT 3.1? I would love to hear more about it, as might
<BR>
others on this list. I've just started serious forays into the land of COM,
<BR>
DCOM, ActiveX, and a whole bunch of recycled acronyms like Ole (&quot;COM is
<BR>
Love&quot;, and you linux people better believe it, because it's coming...), and
<BR>
I'd love to hear something about the early development of Ole &amp; ActiveX.
<BR>
<P>Anyone who is bored by such discussion, just remember that your future
<BR>
wearables/surgical implants may very well run an MS or MS derived OS,
<BR>
meaning that somewhere, embedded in your head, under thousands of layers of
<BR>
newer, similarly incomprehensible code, COM will be lurking...
