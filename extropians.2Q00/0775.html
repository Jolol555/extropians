<EM>&gt; And you are saying that more taxes and government controls are a good thing?

<BR>
Under some circumstances, yes.
<BR>
<P>Clue: I am _not_ a libertarian; I'm a liberal, in the classical sense
<BR>
of being a member of the Liberal Party of the United Kingdom (not to be
<BR>
confused with those running-dog revisionist-socialist Liberal Democrats).
<BR>
I'm on your side on the civil liberties issues, but I don't believe in
<BR>
simplistic economic nostrums and uncontrolled free-market economics as
<BR>
the final solution to all our woes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If you remove OPEC, bad things happen:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Firstly, the price of oil crashes. Each oil producer in the middle east will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; start pumping like crazy in an attempt to maximize revenue, because everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will be trying to undercut their neighbour and when you cut your prices you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have to make it up on volume.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Outstanding. This is NOT a bad thing. This is a very good thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>In dealing with a finite resource?
<BR>
<P>You gotta be joking.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There won't be a shortage, this is bull. The market will finally meet the demand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at a market determined price, not a producer determined price. If the british
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oil unions go out of work, well, I won't cry for them.
</EM><BR>

<BR>
There ain't no such animals; just high-tech companies that specialise in
<BR>
extracting oil from under half a mile of frigid and turbulent ocean.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Basically, prices will yo-yo violently. The whole process will be aggravated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by the diminishing reserves -- wildly fluctuating prices will discourage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; oil companies from exploring for new fields, too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fine. We already have plenty of fields as it is, most of which are not being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explored only because of governments setting these areas aside in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintain an artificially high oil price.
</EM><BR>
<P>Check out last year's Scientific American run -- there was a rather
<BR>
worrying feature in it (by some geologists specialising in petrochemical
<BR>
prospecting) who pointed out that the official figures for known reserves
<BR>
have been gerrymandered by governments (yeah, OPEC members) for political
<BR>
reasons relating to their OPEC-assigned extraction quotas. Basically,
<BR>
they moved a lot of stuff that was officially off the books onto the
<BR>
books in the last decade, in order to justify increasing their output
<BR>
at a time of diminishing prices.  The actual undetected but retrievable
<BR>
reserves are believed to be pretty small -- nobody is too interested
<BR>
in oil fields where the energy cost to extract a barrel exceeds the
<BR>
product. By their estimate, we pass the 50% exploitation level some
<BR>
time between 2005 and 2010, and from there on out oil prices _will_
<BR>
climb as the accessible reserves are worked out and the only new fields
<BR>
coming on-stream are highly inconvenient (e.g. the Atlantic fields).
<BR>
<P>Encouraging people to think that oil is cheap and will remain so in
<BR>
perpetuity is a Bad Thing(TM) in terms of long term collective self-
<BR>
interest; we need to be able to migrate from an oil-burning civilization
<BR>
to something more efficient and sustainable, and cheap oil encourages us
<BR>
to stay fat and lazy and not bother doing things like developing 
<BR>
nuclear or renewable energy sources. By the time the oil price begins
<BR>
climbing steeply because the oil is running low, there may not be 
<BR>
enough money around to begin such a large-scale conversion without
<BR>
widespread economic dislocation.
<BR>
<P>I _hope_ I'm wrong about this, but I really don't want to see unhampered
<BR>
deflationary price wars in the oil industry end up forcing us back into
<BR>
the nineteenth century by the mid-twenty-first.
