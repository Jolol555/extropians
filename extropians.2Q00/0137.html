YES! They would protect the citizens from bad cops, protect the cops from 
<BR>
bad citizens, make court cases much faster, better, cheaper etc, and we all 
<BR>
get those wonderfully hilarious &quot;Worlds Wildest Police Videos&quot; as free

lowbrow entertainment.

<P>In Anchorage we used to have two daily newspapers but now we only have one.  
<BR>
To counter the influence of it a group of local journalists put together a 
<BR>
weekly paper called the 'Anchorage Press' which has now won numerous awards 
<BR>
and does a great job of muckraking(in the positive way my journalism prof 
<BR>
taught us the term)!  It is a very colorful little paper to say the least.  
<BR>
When a local youthgroup put an ad in it for a summer camp, it wound up next 
<BR>
to an ad of similar size for a stripjoint!  They never did that again!
<BR>
<P>Anyway, in the latest issue the story is told about an APD officer got into 
<BR>
a scuffle in an arrest attempt with a martial arts instructor who was at his 
<BR>
workplace.  The charge the cop was acting on had been dropped and the 
<BR>
instructor wanted to talk about it and not be cuffed for he knew he was an 
<BR>
innocent man.  It was a clerical mistake that sparked the event.  The 
<BR>
stories of the instructor and his students were quite different from the 
<BR>
cop. lol!  Video surveilance would have really helped.  The story is a good 
<BR>
read.  Look for, 'Cops k.o. karate school.'
