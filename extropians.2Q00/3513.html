<EM>&gt; &gt;Actually, in all the transparency debate no one has really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;brought out the fact that our society is quietly at war with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;itself in a sense.  There are members therein who *want*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the freedom to litter, tag, etc, whereas there are other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;members that do not want to look at the mess or pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to have it cleaned up and painted over.  I do not know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;how to satisfy both sides.  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about segregrated inclusiveness?  What's that mean?  Well in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; context it means a sort of Randesque egoism, allowing everyone to do what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they feel, without infringing the right of others to do the same.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Specifically, how about designating certain spaces as taggable (galleries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even, for this &quot;artform&quot;).  Those of us who don't appreciate that sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;art&quot; are not subjected to it during our daily commutes, but those who must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; express themselves that way have an outlet for it.  Basically it comes down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to &quot;live and let live.&quot;

<P>There's a wasp's nest out on the patio.  It was started a couple of months ago
<BR>
by an idiot wasp that figured it would make a nest right above the path of
<BR>
traffic.  Since then it is still there, and it grows incrementally, it is about
<BR>
an inch or two across.  Every day or so I see the wasp flyng from place to
<BR>
place, and a few times it has buzzed me, or a plant.
<BR>
<P>I was loathe to destroy this wasp nest when it was first undertaken, and
<BR>
somewhat enjoy it being around, not having been stung.  Yet, if anyone is stung
<BR>
by the wasp, then I will destroy it.
<BR>
<P>The issue resolves to be how long the wasp is allowed.  It is relatively
<BR>
innocuous, and attractive in its way, but carries the capability to sting.  The
<BR>
actuaries will tell us that the longer the wasp is around the more likely a
<BR>
sting.  So then, the courses of action are to destroy the wasp's nest
<BR>
immediately upon finding one, randomly, or when it is deemed intolerable by
<BR>
some objective or subjective standard, or to let it remain indefinitely while
<BR>
the probability of a wasp sting approaches one or is past..
<BR>
<P>In this case, then, I am the party with the requisite physical force to destroy
<BR>
the wasp, of course the only reason to do so being that it has a sting.  As it
<BR>
is, I do it no harm and let it multiply.
<BR>
<P>The moral is fight the power.
<BR>
<P>This message brought to you by the general effort to relegalize.  &quot;If it was
<BR>
legal before, why not now?&quot;  Especially, George Washington smoked marijuana, it
<BR>
is said.
<BR>
<P>About this art issue in relation to transparency, I think many people have
<BR>
quite legal disgusting habits that would be quite more unnerving to the rest of
<BR>
the naked public then any kind of graffiti habit.  The larger issue would be
<BR>
that of the so called victimless crimes, largely, those cases where a person
<BR>
chooses to self-prescribe themself some kind of drug, for medicinal or
<BR>
recreational reasons.
<BR>
<P>I didn't reply to some replies about the Waco business, when it happened,
<BR>
people let it happen too easily, and there wasn't two to five independent
<BR>
cameras covering the scene as there should have been, that is to say, where the
<BR>
government employs action of force, notice, or policing of any kind against its
<BR>
citizens, then it must be recorded in a nonrepudiable, consistent, and reliable
<BR>
way.  At this point, as ever, it's a circus, and I think anyone can agree that
<BR>
having twenty independent video reporters on site as it happened would make a
<BR>
lot more people confident of the truth as it happened.
<BR>
<P>At issue is how to balance that with the citizenry's assumption of innocence.
<BR>
That is to say, every citizen is assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Thus,
<BR>
some of these encroachments of automated monitoring are shadowy violations of
<BR>
the explicit right to be free from undue searches.
<BR>
<P>So, when an agent of government is at work monitoring the citizenry, then he
<BR>
shall be monitored for the citizenry.  Anything less is a slope towards the
<BR>
Orwellian nightmare dilemna.  It is recognized that the agents are citizens
<BR>
themselves.
<BR>
<P>As ever, it is not only who is watching, but who is paying the watchmen.  In
<BR>
this case, it is the citizenry, indirectly, but the problem lies in that the
<BR>
budgets are assigned by bureaucrats with insufficent accountability for the
<BR>
preservation of rights, yet at least there are systemic means of seeking
<BR>
recourse of grievance.  In the sense of this thread of privatized law
<BR>
enforcement and judicial undertakings, badges for hire are almost inherently
<BR>
bad for real justice.

<EM>&gt; &quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; --Thomas Jefferson
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, enjoy that peace pipe, homes, because if you ignore the past, the end
<BR>
result of which is the present, it will ignore you.  Now then, I do not think
<BR>
that you, Powers, or Thomas Jefferson ignore or ignored the past, although I do
<BR>
think T.J. had a much better grasp of it.  Thus from him and other idealists at
<BR>
the time was born our quite defensibly open, honest, and free nation, largely
<BR>
able to not have a history.  The problem which perhaps he would forsee is how
<BR>
to keep it that way.  The founders were incredibly brave and have given us a
<BR>
gift that is not to be taken lightly, as well, its lofty goals must be
<BR>
preserved and expanded with the zeal that they are due.
