Not meaning to belittle this whole experience.  Believe me; I've been there. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, writing our Amiga SIG's newsletter column, I - humorously, I thought 
<BR>
- referred to a no-show demonstrator as someone whose name &quot;shall thereafter 
<BR>
be Mudd.&quot;  I didn't even provide the info that anyone could have used to 
<BR>
actually identify the guy.  Nevertheless, he contacted the clubs Board of 
<BR>
Directors, lodged an official complaint, threatened legal action, and then 
<BR>
someone else came on board with a defense of the implicitly maligned &quot;Mudd&quot; 
<BR>
name.  Jeez.
<BR>
<P>Not that I'm trying to make a direct comparison - or get involved in any way 
<BR>
- please, no, no, no.  I realy am coming in on the middle here and don't 
<BR>
want to imply that I even understand the debate - just that it seems like a 
<BR>
lot of time got wasted somehow.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, your experience and that of the other correspondents involved makes 
<BR>
me feel good in comparison about some of the lengthy debates I've gotten 
<BR>
into here.
<BR>
<P>As a general suggestion, however, wouldn't it be nice if all posts contained 
<BR>
a back trace.  It is really almost impossible to find the time to try to go 
<BR>
back and retrieve all the previous posts in a particular thread - at least 
<BR>
from Hotmail.  Thus, I often find myself coming in on the middle without 
<BR>
ever hearing the full context, and I'm sure that others have this 
<BR>
experience.
<BR>
<P>This must be doable within the newsgroup software.  We used to have it on 
<BR>
BBS's as a matter of course.  Perhaps this is just my ignorance and someone 
<BR>
can tell me that this is already available???
