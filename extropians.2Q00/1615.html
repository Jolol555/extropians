Mike Lorrey Writes:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Unfortunately, we have a tradition of booting the British out here, so our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sympathies tend to go to the 'underdogs'. After the rev war here, many
</EM><BR>
tories
<BR>
<EM>&gt; stayed. Some got picked on, sure, while others hightailed it for Canada
</EM><BR>
and then
<BR>
<EM>&gt; sicced their lawyers to try to regain the property they had abandoned (and
</EM><BR>
when
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that didn't work, they instigated the War of 1812 (the 'British' troops
</EM><BR>
were
<BR>
<EM>&gt; mostly Canadians)). You might call Canada the North American equivalent of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Northern Ireland, and you've also got a put upon Catholic minority up
</EM><BR>
there too.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure Canadians just love the Ulster Unionists...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As for myself, a Catholic Scottish American whose family got relocated to
</EM><BR>
Nova
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Scotia from the Gordon's Highlands, I've got little or no sympathies for
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; headaches the Protestant British have brought on themselves, while at the
</EM><BR>
same
<BR>
<EM>&gt; time I have no sympathies for the marxist ideology of most IRA members.
</EM><BR>
Frankly
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you deserve each other.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks a lot. It's good to know that you think I should be bombed by a bunch
<BR>
of madmen because of something my countrymen did several hundred years ago.
<BR>
<P>A lot of people seem to be under the misapprehension that the IRA are
<BR>
freedom fighters struggling against the evil oppression of the British
<BR>
(English) Empire.  They are not.  They (and the UVF) are just drug runners
<BR>
and pimps with an extremely brutal streak that use the politics/religion as
<BR>
an excuse to play gangsters.
<BR>
<P>The British soldiers are there to keep the peace, thankless task though that
<BR>
is.
