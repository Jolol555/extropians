This appeared in the &quot;Letterbag&quot; section of the current
<BR>
NewsScan..................
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in the remarks on manners vs.
<BR>
morality, and think it is a useful subject for our society
<BR>
to contemplate. Thank you for opening the dialogue. Years
<BR>
ago I was struck by a scene in the film Laurence of
<BR>
Arabia. King Faisal is talking with a reporter who is
<BR>
heading into the desert to observe an upcoming battle.
<BR>
(Whether the remark was actually made by Faisal, or is
<BR>
simply good screen writing, isn't critical here.) The king
<BR>
says, &quot;Ah, yes, mercy. Laurence has a passion for mercy.
<BR>
With me it is simply good manners. You shall have an
<BR>
opportunity to observe which motivation is the more
<BR>
reliable.&quot; That the battle ends with the fictionalized
<BR>
Laurence opting for total carnage doesn't prove one thing
<BR>
or another -- films go the way the script goes. But
<BR>
Faisal's remark is an interesting view of an issue that
<BR>
will become more and more critical as we become more and
<BR>
more of a global society. The peoples of Islam, of
<BR>
Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and Judaism -- to name
<BR>
only a few -- draw on overlapping but different
<BR>
moralities. And we are increasingly linked by economic
<BR>
realities while separated by competition for shrinking
<BR>
space and finite resources. What motivation do we want
<BR>
everyone to rely on when we are toe to toe, armed with
<BR>
conflicting moralities and weapons the people of Faisal's
<BR>
day never dreamed of: morality, or good manners? (Lynn
<BR>
Kearny)
