<EM>&gt; The outgoing video should be time sequenced and encrypted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If it is tightly enough integrated with some self-checks for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things like changes in impedances, you aren't going to be able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to &quot;hack-in&quot; and divert the transmitter video feed.  If the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outgoing data sequence is time-stamp encoded, you aren't going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to switch the feed to a different video unit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If people can make secure electronic transactions, they ought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be able to make secure video feeds (after all, it only has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to go one way, while electronic transactions have to go in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both directions).
</EM><BR>
<P>If you can put all that data into the video feed easily, then it can easily be
<BR>
counterfeited. Video feeds carry a lot of data, a lot of bandwidth. The security
<BR>
of any encrypted message is directly proportional to the size of the message.
<BR>
The larger the message, the easier it is to break the encryption. Encrypted
<BR>
financial transactions consist of packeted records that are typically less than
<BR>
a few thousand characters in length, optimally less than 400 characters. To gain
<BR>
the same level of security for a hundred megabyte per minute video feed as you
<BR>
do for 400 characters encrypted at a 60 bit encryption level, you'd need
<BR>
something along the lines of 10,000-50,000 bit encryption on the video feed.
<BR>
This high a level of encryption requires significant processing, and time to
<BR>
process. You won't get anything near real-time video feeds, which will allow
<BR>
sufficient lag for splicing in counterfeited data, artificial time stamping, as
<BR>
well as outright destruction of the camera while it is processing video, so the
<BR>
home station will never see who destroys the camera because that footage was
<BR>
still being processed on the camera.
