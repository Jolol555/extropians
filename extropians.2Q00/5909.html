<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Relatively speaking, any man made device today is puny compared to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;volume of solar wind, but it's locally very intense. I remember reading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about Soviet Topaz reactors trailing a plume of energetic particles that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could fry microcircuits &quot;down orbit&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Adding to this -
<BR>
<P>Satellites in orbit shed alot of junk- paint flakes, plastic and metal
<BR>
erosion and so forth. All of this junk is usually charged, and it
<BR>
leads to chemical contamination and erosion of satelite comonents
<BR>
like solar panels, optical windows, etc
<BR>
<P>When satelites are boosted from geo transfer orbit to geostationary orbit
<BR>
(GEO = 6.6 earth-radii), many of the solid rocket motor burns release
<BR>
aluminum oxide spherules, (which become quickly charged) adding even more
<BR>
stuff to the space  environment. This debris in the .01 to 10 micron size
<BR>
range outnumbers the natural micrometeroids (in this size range).
<BR>
<P>About 80% of the exhaust particles hit the Earth in a day or less, some
<BR>
after just a few hours. However about 20% can have stable orbits
<BR>
of lifetimes of many years- depending on the magnetospheric conditions.
<BR>
(Strong magnetospheric conditions will cause the charged submicron particles
<BR>
to lose energy and eventually hit the Earth in a month or so.)
<BR>
<P>(BTW, a tiny number of these spherules can leave the Earth's environment and
<BR>
the Solar System, under the right conditions too)
<BR>
<P>I have a colleague, Hakan Svedhem, at ESTEC in Noordwijk that is flying
<BR>
a dust detector in GEO, piggy-backing to a Russian satellite. This detector
<BR>
is twin, a spare unit actually, of the Ulysses and Galileo dust detectors.
<BR>
Hakan's particle impact data is quite unusual- he is seeing impacts
<BR>
of particles carrying potentials of thousands of volts. There are several
<BR>
possible explanations having to do with various charging processes and what
<BR>
can happen to particles of particular material properties and in particular
<BR>
plasmas, but it seems  sure now that a correlation exists for a large
<BR>
number (say &gt; 50%)) of those  highly charged particles occurring at a
<BR>
close proximity in time to a geo-transfer orbit (GTO) burn. In fact I
<BR>
hear that he's able to identify from his data whether the boost
<BR>
was a NASA rocket boost or an ESA rocket boost.
<BR>
<P>The Earth's enviroment is really dynamic. The magnetosphere is
<BR>
constantly changing in close response to the Sun and the energy
<BR>
of electrons can easily be in the kilo-electron Volt range. Geostationary
<BR>
orbit conditions are highly variable- the orbit location skims the inner
<BR>
boundary of the Earth's magnetospheric plasma sheet, and the radiation
<BR>
belts are located nearby as well.
<BR>
<P>ESA models these &quot;debris plumes&quot;, by the way, and spends a huge amount
<BR>
of time, effort, and money measuring the effect of rocket debris on
<BR>
satellites and determining the natural and man-made Earth debris populations
<BR>
and how those populations evolve in time, and also the  charging
<BR>
and dynamics of the particles in the Earth's magnetosphere (that's
<BR>
the part I'm involved with).
<BR>
<P>I realize that most of this discussion  was about conditions at low Earth
<BR>
orbit (and below), but I thought I'd tell you a little bit about what
<BR>
is happening further up.
