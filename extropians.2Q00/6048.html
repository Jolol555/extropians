<EM>&gt; There's been discussion about the space treaty and how it applies to land

<EM>&gt; ownership - who cares?

<EM>&gt; Land ownership is a social construction. I own land if a certain amount of

<EM>&gt; people around me believe that I own it, meaning that they will not walk on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it without permission or try to build on it, and that to get these rights,

<EM>&gt; they recognize that they need to obtain them from me, and that I may decline

<EM>&gt; any contract to do so.

<P>A nation that says you should not be able to &quot;claim&quot; the land could take
<BR>
action to ruin whatever land you live on (if not by outright military
<BR>
action, then possibly by sending all kinds of probes to do &quot;experiments&quot;
<BR>
right in your way, where you touching them or interfering with them in
<BR>
any way would be an excuse for armed conflict); or, if you set up trade,
<BR>
or at least resupply, runs with someone still on Earth, then just
<BR>
interfering with that someone.  That they would gain nothing from it is
<BR>
beside the point: they would feel more secure without someone that does
<BR>
not report to them living so dramatically outside their perceived reach.
