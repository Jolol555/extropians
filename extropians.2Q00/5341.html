Title
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prolongation of life in an experimental model of aging in Drosophila
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;melanogaster.
<BR>
Source

&nbsp;&nbsp;Neurochemical Research.  24(2):227-33, 1999 Feb.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(R)-Deprenyl, the archetypical monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor, has been shown
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to increase life-span in a number of species. Although many theories for this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;effect have been suggested, for example, an increase in superoxide dismutase
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(SOD) activity, the mechanism of action has yet to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;elucidated. To investigate this phenomenon, we have examined the effects of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(R)-deprenyl, and some aliphatic propargylamines, in an experimental aging
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;model in Drosophila melanogaster. Both wild-type Oregon-R type flies, as well
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as a SOD knock-out mutant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;strain were used. Flies obtained from a series of paired mates were divided
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;equally among treatment groups. In all studies, flies were treated for the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;duration of life following adult emergence. The aging model consists of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;substitution of sucrose with galactose in the regular food media of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flies. Initial experiments confirmed that such a substitution resulted in a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significant (p &lt; 0.01, Breslow test) reduction in mean and maximal life-span
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of flies, an effect not due to nutrient deprivation. Inclusion of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(R)-deprenyl and the aliphatic propargylamines in the media, at average daily
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;doses in the range 0.5-1 ng/fly/day, led to a significant increase in mean
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and maximal life-span of galactose-treated, but not control flies. This
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;effect was seen in both wild-type and mutant flies.
