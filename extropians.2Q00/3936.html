<EM>&gt;subsequent evidence forced him to change.  I, OTOH, had simply stated that

<EM>&gt;of incompetence or dishonesty, and Ian, among others here, did indeed do this,

<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: The VDS FLIR test is still properly criticized for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their deliberate alteration of the thermal conditions on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ground in order to highlight reflections and obscure
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gunshots. That they would do that could suggest that they
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need to hide something. Howver, I'm satsified that none
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the alleged events, including what Ghigliotti said
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were people running around, are what plantiffs experts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have said they are, and with the new tape I have (which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a high-grade copy of a copy of attorney James Brannon's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy, I've seen all and what I have is virtually identicle,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what I had was horrible by contrast), it is hard to believe
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the findings of the plaintiffs experts. There are two walls
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with windows that fall directing onto both areas of courtyard
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where there are key flashes said by Allard et al to be gunshots.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we can draw the trajectory of a falling window to each of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the key courtyard locations. In fact, key flashes that Allard
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says are gunshots on the Emmy-award winning &quot;Waco: The Rules
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Engagement&quot; occur exactly as one of the walls with window
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is crashing down, depositing glass shards to the spot. At
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no time before it fell were there flashes there, and then
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there were periodic flashes there every time the aircraft
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comes into the right quadrant of sky (as Hal has noted).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explaining how glass gets to key flash locations was a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary prerequisite cited by Maurice Cox, one of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FLIR experts, to invalidate the gunshot theory. It's done.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;until the evidence became so clear that he could no longer deny it.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: I felt it was not proper to abandon the gunshot
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theory until the rapid-flash problem was resolved. The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VDS report didn't resolve it, but I believe that I have.
