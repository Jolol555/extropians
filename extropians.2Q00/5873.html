Steve van Sickle writes, regarding anti-semitism on Extropians:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps it was the thread a few weeks back that included the term ZOG in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the subject line.  I'm not sure if the people using it understood its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meaning, and there was probably some subject creep.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ZOG stands for &quot;Zionist Occupation Government&quot;.  It is a term used for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; U.S. federal government by the sort of degenerate creeps who think the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Turner Diaries&quot; is great literature and claim the Holocaust was all a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jewish hoax.  You might as well be waving a swastika.
</EM><BR>
<P>At the time the owner of the email account which posted that message
<BR>
explained that he had not sent it, it was sent by a friend who had logged
<BR>
in under his account.  The account owner agreed that the message was
<BR>
not funny and in poor taste.
<BR>
<P>Only one person posted that he thought it was funny.  Everyone else
<BR>
either objected or asked what ZOG meant.
<BR>
<P>This incident can hardly be considered evidence that Extropians are
<BR>
anti-semitic.
