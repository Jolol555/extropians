<P>
Cameras wouldn't reduce accidents.  Are they going to be some kind of huge
<BR>
inflatable airbag cameras?
<BR>
<P>It is true that some drivers have bad driving habits and they, along with 16-18
<BR>
year olds, and various drunk people, are the most likely to cause accidents. (I
<BR>
have very good driving skills and habits, in my opinion).
<BR>
<P>I don't run red lights, even when there is no one there.  That's pointless when
<BR>
no one is there, but it's not a bad habit to observe the traffic signals.  In
<BR>
terms of driving speed, I am normally aware of the posted speed limits.  I don't
<BR>
engage in road rage nor cutoff others, and I endeavor to look out for others
<BR>
while highway driving as I pass them.
<BR>
<P>In terms of truck rigs, they have a longer stopping and starting time and some
<BR>
blind spots.
<BR>
<P>Consider a twenty mile radius around any major metropolitan area, and say that
<BR>
for surprise one day every time a driver passed the posted speed limit on any
<BR>
road, that they were fined. (As an aside, the winning strategy would be to only
<BR>
pass the posted speed rate once and maintain a higher rate of speed, or to
<BR>
actually not speed).  First of all, a large variety of government workers, police
<BR>
officers, nuns, and little old ladies would receive fines. Second, 95+% of all
<BR>
other drivers would.  There would be huge negative feedback.  Next, monitor every
<BR>
lane change and turn for appropriate signalling.  That is ludicrous.
<BR>
<P>I have digressed from the point that monitoring wouldn't reduce accidents.  A
<BR>
record might serve after-the-fact to establish liability for an accident in
<BR>
addition to the drivers' and passengers words along with smears on the pavement,
<BR>
which might justify rigs sporting cameras, but there's no reason for the
<BR>
government to do it, and thus for TAXPAYERS to PAY for it.
<BR>
<P>I think dangerous driving would be better served by education programs to
<BR>
drivers.  For example, how about a &quot;Drive Safely Campaign&quot; and a &quot;War on Bad
<BR>
Drivers&quot;, seeing as how automobile accidents cause &quot;some 40K people&quot; to die per
<BR>
year, that being &quot;some 40K people&quot; more than have ever from marijuana alone.
<BR>
<P>Do red-light cameras on downtown DC intersections reduce accidents?  No, they
<BR>
make money for Lockheed Martin and press for monitorists.  Do they infringe
<BR>
rights?  Arguably, yes.
<BR>
<P>So I do agree that traffic accidents are bad and that they are moreso caused by
<BR>
passenger automobiles than freight trucks, but my opinion is that monitoring
<BR>
would not decrease accidents.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Im interested in how the cryonics crowd will see this red light camera
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  business.  If one is young, healthy, and has no dangerous habits, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  most likely cause of death (seems to me anyway) is being T-boned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  in an intersection by some crazed yahoo burning the red light.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The way some (many) people drive is a dangerous habit.  I would support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cameras in many more highway locations other than just redlights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I speak from experience......you would not BELEIVE what i see on a daily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basis.&lt;sigh&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh yeah.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some stats.(all approximations)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some 40K people die each year (last year....lowest in history) on the highway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (1.5 per 100M miles driven)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some 5K died in truck/auto accidents.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some 70% of all truck/auto accidents are the fault of the auto (according to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Federal DOT).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The new federal hours of service regulations (which will disrupt &quot;life as we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know it&quot; more than Y2K's worst nightmare ever would....city dwellers take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; note.) is aimed at reducing that 5K by half....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not possible as I veiw the numbers....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5k -(.7(5k))=1500 vs .5(5k)=2500
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neglecting to consider that not all (even many) truck/auto accidents involve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fatigue.....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;sigh&gt;
</EM><BR>

<P>As an aside completely not about this, Xiaoguang Li's post &quot;neurohacking?&quot; is
<BR>
very interesting.
<BR>
<P>About this, the subject being &quot;law enforcement for profit&quot;, law enforcement based
<BR>
on any direct profit subverts justice and is wrong.  Law enforcement should be
<BR>
for the people and the peace, only, and while this yields indirect profit to all,
<BR>
any direct form of payoff to enforcers yields corruption.
<BR>
<P>About log files, there are many log files.  They can be subpoenad just like any
<BR>
other form of information, unless they belong to the government they aren't
<BR>
property of the government.  It should be easy, just look how easy it is to get
<BR>
e-mail from the executive.
