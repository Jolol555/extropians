<EM>&gt; The Amish have been a theme running through a bunch of recent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; messages.  I'm moved to mention a few of the visions that thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the future of the Amish gives me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) The Amish slowy evaporate ala the Shakers because they lose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; critical mass.   Doesn't seem to be happening at the moment, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty cool.  I know the Shakers (no sex) are a bad example on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continuity side.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Shakers evaported because they were celibate and did not marry. The
<BR>
Amish beleive in good sized families, so I don't see a problem there,
<BR>
and they do allow young people to go into the 'English' world for a
<BR>
number of years, sample the pleasures of our decadent civilization, and
<BR>
only return to the Amish fold when they decide they want to marry and
<BR>
settle down in the Amish lifestyle. An interesting thing about the Amish
<BR>
is that because of their religion, they get some special tax breaks that
<BR>
you can't get otherwise. For example, they pay no social security taxes. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) The Amish disappear because their way of life becomes economically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unsustainable.  Any number of reasons present themselves, such as:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  o No market for their products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  o No remaining sources for the tech that they need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  o Can't expand to support population growth because the rest of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; galaxy has been converted to computronium.....
</EM><BR>
<P>Authentic Amish products command a premium in the marketplace due to
<BR>
their handcrafted nature, their reputation for high quality products,
<BR>
etc.
<BR>
<P>Amish don't have an opposition to technology per se. The
<BR>
gas/propane/steam/pneumatic powered equipment they use is VERY
<BR>
sophisticated stuff. They always pay in full, in cash, for all equipment
<BR>
they buy. They don't finance things. The equipment they buy is very
<BR>
rugged, and lasts for many years. They mostly only have opposition to a)
<BR>
motorized transportation, and b) electrically powered devices. I once
<BR>
saw an Amish farmer with a big steam harvester, steel, not rubber tires
<BR>
(sparks coming up off the road like gangbusters), being pulled by a team
<BR>
of horses to his fields a few miles away on the paved road.
<BR>
<P>I don't know how the Amish would deal with non-electronic computers, I
<BR>
would imagine that they would adopt them.
