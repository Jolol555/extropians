<P>Joe, did you really write these?  If so you have real talent writing bawdy 
<BR>
lyrics.  You should put them to music!  You could have a real career in the 
<BR>
comedy category of country music!
<BR>
<P>I saw a skit on a comedy show where the actor, Randy Quaid was the host.  In 
<BR>
the skit he played a very redneck country singer with song titles like &quot;if 
<BR>
you don't like America, go straight to hell!&quot; and &quot;I love America, to hell 
<BR>
with all foreigners!&quot;  They mentioned the names of about twenty of his songs 
<BR>
and they all only slightly varied on this theme.  As he sang the flag waved 
<BR>
in the background, of course.  The skit skewered its subject pretty well.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
