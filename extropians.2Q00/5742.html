One
<BR>
<EM> &gt; of the few Poul Anderson novels I haven't read is ORION SHALL RISE &gt; 
</EM><BR>
(1973),
<BR>
<EM> &gt; one of his Maurai series. I wouldn't be surprised if...
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  Yep, that's what the book's about.  It was nominated for the LFS Hall of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Fame award a few years ago, which is when I read it.  Pretty good, too.  
</EM><BR>
In
<BR>
<EM> &gt; this book, the northwestern section of the US has evolved from its 
</EM><BR>
current
<BR>
<EM> &gt; reputation as eco-freaks to anti-government isolationists.  When the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; government starts to get uppity again and talks of reining them in, they
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hatch their plan to leave. Chris ---  Chris Hibbert

<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I understand there has been some concern over the radio activity involved 
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM> &gt; launching the Orion space ship design from the surface of the Earth.  
</EM><BR>
However
<BR>
<EM> &gt; has anyone done a study on that subject?  Have the Engineers, as they so
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; often do, found a way to avoid radio activity in a launch from the 
</EM><BR>
surface?

<P>While there have been many designs for 'clean' atomic bombs, they are only 
<BR>
clean
<BR>
in relation to normal bombs, as demonstrated in Project Plowshare, the 
<BR>
'Bombs
<BR>
for Peace' program, where the AEC tried to develop interest in using nukes 
<BR>
for
<BR>
large scale excavation and mining projects...
<BR>
<P>Considering the amount of atmospheric testing already done to date, with 
<BR>
little
<BR>
long term ill effects outside of a few small areas, and considering the 
<BR>
amount
<BR>
of mass an Orion can put into orbit (measured in hundreds and thousands of 
<BR>
tons,
<BR>
not in pounds or kg.) I wouldn't mind  one or a dozen launches specifically 
<BR>
to
<BR>
bootstrap us into a decent industrial and exploratory capability in space. 
<BR>
Heck,
<BR>
you could launch a full Mars Base mission off of one Orion alone, get
<BR>
terraforming started early... MARS NEEDS WOMEN!
