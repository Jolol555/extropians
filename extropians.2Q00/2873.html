Hello,
<BR>
<P>I've been lurking on this list for a little while but have had little to add
<BR>
until now.  Forgive me if the following is incoherent--I'm thinking as I
<BR>
write rather than thinking things through completely and then writing.
<BR>
<P>My own experiences lead me to suspect that the fragments of consciousness we
<BR>
think of as our minds are capable of operating at only a small fraction of
<BR>
their actual potential while experienced within the human body.
<BR>
<P>I noticed some of your recent posts referring to the &quot;Singularity&quot; and
<BR>
followed some links to discover which singularity this might be.  I find
<BR>
that after reading a couple of the essays my take on the idea of
<BR>
greater-than-human intelligence is different from that of the authors of the
<BR>
essays.
<BR>
<P>These authors seemed to view the coming of super-human intelligence as a
<BR>
cause for alarm or sadness, rather in the same way they view the ending of
<BR>
the life of a human body.  I see another possibility:  the opportunity for
<BR>
the expression of a greater fraction of the &quot;ultimate consciousness&quot; than is
<BR>
possible from within a human body.
<BR>
<P>I had not thought to bring up the possibility of human consciousness apart
<BR>
from the body on this list, since most of the participants seem to see the
<BR>
mind and body as inseparable and to think of physical immortality as a
<BR>
prerequisite to mental immortality.  However, since Sasha's death, there's
<BR>
been more talk of the possibility that consciousness can exist apart from a
<BR>
physical container for some length of time.
<BR>
<P>Earlier in this post I mentioned experiences I've had which lead me to
<BR>
believe that our minds are only fragments of a greater intelligence.  One of
<BR>
these experiences involves a sort of super-data-base which can be accessed
<BR>
from altered states of consciousness such as a trance state. I haven't
<BR>
studied enough psychology to know if this is the sort of thing Jung referred
<BR>
to as the &quot;collective unconscious&quot; but I've heard the term, and it seems to
<BR>
fit the experience.
<BR>
<P>I think that rather than going on at greater length, I should post this and
<BR>
see if anyone else on this list is interested.  I should probably add that
<BR>
I'm not associated with any formal religeon and that my &quot;spiritual&quot;
<BR>
experiences have more in common with science fiction than with Sunday
<BR>
School.

<P><P>Michael LaTorra mused:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I doubt that our computational devices are capable of hosting human-level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information processing yet. That being said, there is a part of me that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hopes that somewhere, on a Net-connected machine, Sasha's mind still
</EM><BR>
lives.
<BR>
<P>True... but isn't it the case that the Buddhists believe that one can
<BR>
reincarnate into a lot of things that don't have the processing power
<BR>
to host a human?  (grasshoppers, etc?)
