<EM>&gt;  &gt; What if there is a convention adopted by the entities involved that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; unconstrained replication is not allowed.  Any unconstrained replication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This assumes monoculture, or a singularly powerful all-controlling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; species (and I do really mean singularly powerful). Even if such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing would be possible (without self-destruction, as a trivial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solution) is not obvious. I mean, how a Darwinian system can leave the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolutionary regime, that does not follow.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see it as either a monoculture or a single controlling entity.
<BR>
Rather, there only has to be a consensus that replication is disastrous
<BR>
and must be prevented.  As long as the bulk of the power is held by
<BR>
agents with those views, replication by the others can be held in check.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; is viewed as a threat and is prevented.  Some entities would like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; replicate, but they cannot.  Most do not want to replicate, and attempt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; to prevent others from doing so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A mechanism? Both for action, and how an evolutionary regime can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stripped? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, my first cut at the problem is that the majority would say that
<BR>
they would clobber those who reproduce without constraint.
