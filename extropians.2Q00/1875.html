<EM>&gt; &gt; That's absolutely incorrect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ActiveX was rejected (by just about everyone, including people using MS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; software) primarily because it's a HUGE security problem. 'ActiveX'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; programs (there's nothing special about them, they're just Windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; programs your machine downloads and runs) would load automatically and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; run with full priveledges on your machine. They could trash your hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; disk, read your files, send your data to someone. ActiveX was an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; absolute *disaster*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It's only a secondary point It meant people producing content for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Web that was only viewable by people using Microsoft browsers on Intel-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; based computers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wrong. So long as browsers on other OS's are made with runtime's to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operate these programs, it really doesn't matter what OS is browsing it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've done this with cobol programs. You can run acucobol programs on any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine you want so long as you have the runtimes installed. That is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; failure of other browser manufacturers who refused to implement ActiveX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; runtimes in their browsers simply because it was a Microsoft creation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is they who were being anti-competetive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Additionally, there is no problem with making a runtime that disallows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or allows the user to disallow) certain types of system functions, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as Java does. So the only security hole is due to the release of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unready implementation. That is a typical Microsoft fault, premature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; releasing things. I'm sure that many of those suffering from Bill-envy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will extend that failure to his personal life.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wrong.
<BR>
<P>ActiveX components are simply Windows executables. Making a runtime for
<BR>
them would basically mean making a runtime to allow Windows programs to
<BR>
run on other OS's. This is *not* a simple task, and not one Microsoft is
<BR>
willing to allow (they refuse to document the APIs, hence everything has
<BR>
to be reverse-engineered). Witness the Wine project (allowing Windows
<BR>
programs to run on Linux) - which has taken years to get as far as it
<BR>
has, and although an impressive job is *still* only experimental.
