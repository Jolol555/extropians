<EM>&gt; &gt;...references are cited at that website. Note that sample
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;boundaries are very fuzzy: &quot;toddler,&quot; &quot;infant,&quot; or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;pediatric population.&quot;  Comparisons with firearms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Accidental Discharges are difficult because of recent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;years' use - and contamination - of the stats for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;political purposes.  Mike Lorrey's point natheless is well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;taken IMO:  firearms AD's do not occur frequently enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to justify hysteria; the rationale for the agitation to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;prohibit guns must be sought elsewhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most toddlers (under the age of 4) would have a hard time opening a desk &gt;drawer, lifting the gun and pulling its trigger, so within this age group, &gt;drowning deaths are greater than gunshot deaths.  Most unintentional self- or &gt;other-child-inflicted gunshot deaths of minors (unintentional including &gt;bang-bang games where the child does not understand the reality of the result) &gt;occur in ages 6 - 12, during a dip in child drownings, and in this age group, &gt;when drowning in five-gallon buckets is much less of a danger, gunshot deaths &gt;are most likely greater.  For ages 15-24, when drowning deaths once again spike, &gt;intentional firearm homicides and suicides are also higher than for those &gt;younger or older.
</EM><BR>
<P>My 3 year old nephew is quite capable of all sorts of mischief and is
<BR>
quite strong, so no, I contest your dismissal of toddlers, now that it
<BR>
has been proven that your hysteria with regards to them is not supported
<BR>
by the statistics. Anyone on this list with kids that age can probably
<BR>
contest your claims on that score. The rise in 6-12, 12-15, and 15 and
<BR>
up shootings can be directly correlated to the decrease in the number of
<BR>
children who are taught responsible gun safety from an early age. I shot
<BR>
my first 22 at age 7, and safety, responsibility and the consequences of
<BR>
shooting were taught to myself and every other child in my family. Since
<BR>
the governments own studies support the contention that children who are
<BR>
raised thus are far less likely to either cause accidental shootings or
<BR>
commit intentional shootings, and the once plentiful and popular
<BR>
shooting programs at public schools are now mostly non-existent, I think
<BR>
its quite obvious that we need firearms safety back in schools as much
<BR>
as we need sex safety, drug safety, and driver safety.
