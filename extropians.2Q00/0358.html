<EM>&gt;Given the demonstration in the gulf war, it would seem unfeasible any

military could launch a credible conventional battlefield assault against
<BR>
the U.S. and its allies.  Weapon development, of course, has not remained
<BR>
frozen.  The autonomous armaments appearing in the pipeline would seem to
<BR>
increase this likelyhood.&lt;
<BR>
<P>Absolutely! Not only is it not frozen, buts its accelerating rapidly
<BR>
compared to rest of the world. The article &quot; Boeing UCAV [Unmanned Combat
<BR>
Aerial Vehicle?]aims for September rollout&quot; appeared in the March 27th issue
<BR>
of Aviation week and Space Technology. 
<BR>
Some highlights:
<BR>
<P>Same wingspan, half the length of an F-16
<BR>
Weight: 7500 lbs
<BR>
Weapons payload: 1-3000 lbs
<BR>
production models 90% composite
<BR>
<P>Two flying prototypes will be ready to go sometime in September '00 
<BR>
<P>In the April 3rd issue, the Army Battlelab [Do ya think theres a &quot;Peoples
<BR>
Liberation Army Battlelab&quot; out there? :-)] is developing the &quot;Jedi Vest&quot;
<BR>
which incorporates a palmtop computer, Iridium-like satellite phone, GPS
<BR>
reciever, Viper laser range-finder binoculars (with a 3.5km range!!)  These
<BR>
guys will be fully connected to the entire Army battlefield sensor net in
<BR>
near-real time.  Think of the implications.  All this is going on right now,
<BR>
let alone in 2025.
<BR>
<P>Can you say Kick-ASS!!

<P><P><P>As a result, as many members of the list are probably aware, the military is
<BR>
beginning to advance their capabilities for conducting urban warfare against
<BR>
smaller groups.  Its usually called MOUT, military operations in urban
<BR>
terrain.  Or something like that.  In response, they are initiating
<BR>
something called the Smart Sensor Web initiative with the purpose of
<BR>
providing real-time information from an array of sensors down to the lowest
<BR>
echelons (individual soldiers and squads).  The intent is to get inside the
<BR>
enemey's cycle times, which get shorter all the time.
<BR>
<P>If these trends continue, it would seem the military is preparing for
<BR>
singularity-enabled warfare.
