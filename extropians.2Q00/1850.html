<EM>&gt; &gt; Mike, that 20 MPG number is a fantasy bud.  Otherwise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  its back to aerodynamics 101 for me.  {8^D  spike

<EM>&gt; I don't have Spike's technical prowess in aerodymanics (althoughI know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they're great - someone who has the sense of flight at Mach 20 is my hero),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but to this stick-and-rudder guy, the Moller Aircar &quot;just don't look right&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>WOW!  Thanks Greg, I gotta reply to THAT comment just to see
<BR>
it on my CTR again! {8^D
<BR>
<P>The reason Im having difficulties with Moller's aircar is a neat
<BR>
little estimating technique for the thrust required to maintain straight-
<BR>
and-level flight: you need to know the power-off glide ratio.  If it is
<BR>
10 forward to 1 down, then it takes a thrust of about 1/10 the weight
<BR>
of the aircraft to fly at the power-off glide speed.
<BR>
<P>The Moller aircar looks like it would power-off glide like a set of
<BR>
car keys.  What is that little airfoil way back aft for?  Just to look
<BR>
cool?  Glide ratio 10 down for every one forward?  In any case, it looks
<BR>
like you would need to be making power at *almost* the vertical
<BR>
takeoff rate just to fly straight and level, and with the numbers they
<BR>
call out on the website, with those little tiny rotors, the straight and
<BR>
level power requirement looks like in the neighborhood of 800 hp.
<BR>
Recall that a typical modern Detroit mobile, ambling down the
<BR>
freeway at 100 kph only requires about 30 hp, if I may mix units.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen,  if we want to theorize a really high horizontal speed
<BR>
associated with that 800 hp, we are up against the drag-as-square-
<BR>
of-velocity problem, and so we still have a voracious fuel appetite.
<BR>
Perhaps Doug Jones will weigh in on this, hes more aerominded than
<BR>
I am.
<BR>
<P>I am uncomfortable being in the nay-sayer position, dont like
<BR>
doing that.  But the Moller aircar as shown on the website
<BR>
wont fly in that configuration.  spike
