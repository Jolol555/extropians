<EM>&gt; However, you still don't gain anything by using a VR. For example, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efficient implementation of your example is to dispense with the robot and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its VR maze entirely, and simply run the robot's search algorithm on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mathematical model of the topology of the maze. All the other features of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the VR are wasted bits. The same is true of any computation - running a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; full-blown VR is far more expensive than running an abstract operation that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only implements the features you are interested in working with.

<P>Yes, if your only goal is to solve some particular abstract problem
<BR>
that is the case.  But if your goal is to live life, you need to have
<BR>
a world to interact with.  And it's more than just a &quot;social amenity&quot;.
<BR>
For one thing, there don't necessarily have to be other people involved.
<BR>
It may be that certain kinds of problem solving work best when you do
<BR>
have a physical model of the problem that you can deal with, so as to
<BR>
bring all of your intuition to bear.
<BR>
<P>Say, for example, you are working on some kind of packing problem.
<BR>
Being able to interact with objects and see how they fit together may
<BR>
be a crucial step in developing the insight necessary to get the answer,
<BR>
even using the best (most intelligent) algorithms available.  You might
<BR>
be able to do this in the physical world, but a virtual world will have
<BR>
many advantages.  One of them is energy consumption, although it is
<BR>
probably a small advantage compared to the others.
