</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;Cultural icon Ayn Rand (1905-1982) was known as much for her philosophy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for her fiction. Her original theory of esthetics, which attacks many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;masterpieces&quot; of modernist art, is as combative and controversial as any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;her work, but until now has received little serious scrutiny. In What Art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Is, the authors demonstrate that Rand's ideas are supported by evidence 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;other academic fields.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Rand's lack of appreciation for art and the arts outside her own personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opinion (however, she called it objective) was more due to her inability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;understand and appreciate knowledge outside her own sphere.  Her rigidity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and lack of experience in Contemporary Art seems to be reflective of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rigidity in her psychology and her need for control.  This behavior runs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contrary to the open mindedness and curious attitude which can be aroused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by fluidity and uncertainty.  Such reactions as feelings of  fluidity and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;uncertainty stem are emotions experienced form contemporary art and which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;art modes.  Rand did not have the intellectual flexibility to understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such freeness of intelligent thinking, and such she disregarded as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unimportant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Although an &quot;intellectual&quot;, she lacked a necessary ingredient of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intellectual thinker -- ability to develop knowledge and understanding from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;areas of thought outside one's one sphere of expertise.
</EM><BR>
<P>To the contrary, Rand was noted for being able to grasp the essense of 
<BR>
information and theory far outside her expertise - i.e., theoretical physics 
<BR>
- in minutes, in areas where many people cannot pick it up at all, even with 
<BR>
years of study.  Rand was NOT stupid.  However, like so many extremely 
<BR>
intelligent creative geniuses, she developed some extremely effective and 
<BR>
powerful information filters, which she used as mental shortcuts to get at 
<BR>
the essense of things.
<BR>
<P>As I have noted elsewhere in this discussion group, one of the techniques 
<BR>
for improving signal to noise ratio is regenerative feedback.  Regenerative 
<BR>
feedback, however, always introduces distortion, generally in the form of 
<BR>
maintaining wave forms past their original decay period.  When you turn up 
<BR>
the regeneration too much, the feedback completely overcomes the input 
<BR>
signal and becomes a self-sustaining feedback loop - the unmistakeable 
<BR>
feedback squeal.  The kind of intense focus that Rand was notorious for 
<BR>
easilly lends itself to this very problem.
<BR>
<P>The feedback squeal, however, represents the parts of the receiving system 
<BR>
that you try to keep invisable.  It no longer has anything to do with the 
<BR>
triggering signal - just the harmonics of the receiver.  To avoid this, you 
<BR>
try to detune the receiver, or introduce - in modern high-end P.A. systems - 
<BR>
smart detection and auto-dampening of such feedback.  This corresponds in 
<BR>
one sense, roughly, to the Zen concept of the empty vessel for enlightenment 
<BR>
- combined, let's say, with systematic mental tricks for self-criticism.
<BR>
<P>I.e., you try to disengage your emotional attachment to ideas.  Any 
<BR>
emotional attachment to an idea is a block to truth anyway.  But Rand never 
<BR>
seems to have caught on to this.  In fact, most of her characters in her 
<BR>
novels clearly have major emotional ties to particular beliefs - and Rand 
<BR>
seems to applaud this!  I suspect that she sabotaged her own intellectual 
<BR>
integrity via this flaw in her thinking process - a flaw which was so 
<BR>
intimately tied to her very creative power!
<BR>
<P>I think that something of this sort happened to Rand, especially in her 
<BR>
later years as age and the disappointments of many of her personal and 
<BR>
professional relationships took their psychic toll.  Then is when we started 
<BR>
seeing more and more the hateful intolerance.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;From the Back Cover (also as www.amazon.com)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(snip)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;A groundbreaking alternative to this view is provided by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand (1905 1982). Best known as the author of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, Rand also created an original and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;illuminating theory of art, which confirms the widespread view that much 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;today's purported art is really not art at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Narrow, limited, uninformed.  This is as ridiculous as claiming that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;today's purported science is really not science at all.  The subjective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aspect of art is whatever the artists chooses his art to be.  the objective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aspect of art is represented in the outcome of the artist's ideas -- the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;product.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I find that art today is so fascinating -- so beyond anything ever thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of years ago -- it's just different.  This evening, I was watching a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;program on TV with Ray Kurzweil and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, and four other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;creative thinkers on the subject of &quot;Creativity.&quot;  I loved it.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consensus was that there are no boundaries on creativity and that a most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;necessary element of creativity is to allow oneself to explore an open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;range of possibilities, to make mistakes, to rearrange ideas, etc.  If the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only worthwhile art, as Rand preferred, was the Romantic period and artists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kept making the same plays, fiction, music paintings and sculpture with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same ol' tools,  there would never have been challenge to artististic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;creativity.  How contrary to her own values!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
But the process of creativity is not just one of freeing ones mind of 
<BR>
constraints.  There is also the deliberate creating of constraints in the 
<BR>
formulation of the final artistic product.  Art is, by its nature, a 
<BR>
_selective_ recreation of aspects of reality.  The selection may in large 
<BR>
part be unconscious at the moment of the selection itself, but it is 
<BR>
certainly not random.  That something is a real work of art reflects that it 
<BR>
successfully captured some essense in a way that we cannot or will not allow 
<BR>
ourselves to see in everyday experience, otherwise the concept is 
<BR>
meaningless.  An artist is someone who has the capacity to identify or 
<BR>
perceive essences AND recreate them on canvas or in music, etc.
<BR>
<P>I disagree that Romantic art is the only worthwhile art.  Art can capture an 
<BR>
essential mental process that we do not even have a name for, and we may 
<BR>
have no idea - conceptually - why we are drawn to it.  It can capture our 
<BR>
darkest, bleakest moments and feelings just as easilly as our best and 
<BR>
brightest.  Nevertheless it exists and works through and by capturing and 
<BR>
isolating essences.  It abstracts the essential in an experience and makes 
<BR>
what would otherwise only normally be an abstraction into a concrete that 
<BR>
can be experienced directly.
<BR>
<P>Most of what I have been saying could almost be quotes from Rand on art, as 
<BR>
best I recall her work.  What I believe was the essence of her legitimate 
<BR>
objection to &quot;modern&quot; art was that it rejected the essence of art itself.  
<BR>
That art is whatever an &quot;artist&quot; proclaims it to be, for example.  Not all 
<BR>
that is claimed to be art does in fact capture anything essential.  Some of 
<BR>
it is pure sensationalist crap.  Something either is or isn't art - or else 
<BR>
the word has no meaning.  If not everything is art, then there are 
<BR>
characteristics that can be used to identify it.  That's objectivism.
<BR>
<P>However, just because the artist is otherwise a nihilistic jerk that goes 
<BR>
around spouting subjectivist nonsense doesn't mean that he or she may not be 
<BR>
capable of real art.  I think that Rand tended to jump the gun from personal 
<BR>
critique and comdemnation to concluding that someone wasn't an artist at 
<BR>
all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;The authors apply Rand's theory to a debunking of the work of prominent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;modernists and postmodernists from Mondrian, Jackson Pollock, and Samuel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Beckett to John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and other highly regarded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;postmodernist figures. Finally, they explore the implications of Rand's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ideas for the issues of government and corporate support of the arts, art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;law, and arts education.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Oh my.  This paragraph is painful to read.  Pollock (painter), Cage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(musician), Cunningham (dancer/choreographer) were brilliant artists whose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*innovative* abilities shook the very foundation of the old-world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stifling-stamp on what society thought art was supposed to be. Their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;visionary approach to creativity helped society to break free of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intellectual and emotional constraints.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Sorry, maybe your appreciation is just more refined in certain areas - I 
<BR>
recall having to learn to like &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; as a kid with no 
<BR>
experience with dissonance or minor keys, and once I overcame my own blocks 
<BR>
to recognize the artistic idiom, it became one of my favorites - but I found 
<BR>
Cage, as best I recall after spending considerable time trying to listen and 
<BR>
appreciate him, mostly without merit, as with much modern dance - and I love 
<BR>
many kinds of dance.
