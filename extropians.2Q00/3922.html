<EM>&gt;  Why?  What would make one qualified in this area?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Does QueeneMUSE know Rand's definition of art?  Or why she takes a stand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  against Modern Art?  (I should mention, not all Objectivists and fellow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  travelers agree with Rand's stance here.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I have read all of her work, a guy I dated for a short time had this big 
<BR>
thing for her. Since I am open minded, i did the reasearch. I read it all -- 
<BR>
and with the exception of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; which is a very well written 
<BR>
novel, I found her work most clumsy and intolerant. When I think of her I am 
<BR>
struck with an image of a bitter, psthologically stricken person who survived 
<BR>
traumatic injuries in her homeland and came here to work through her psychic 
<BR>
wounds by outpouring onto paper. What she promotes is largely distrust, 
<BR>
dislike, disdain, contempt, scorn, and loathing. For meny many things. 
<BR>
This is not my style of thought, I am a person who loves.
<BR>
<P>She often refured things she had no knowledge of, if it infringed on her own 
<BR>
whims, even to the point where she wrote contradicting tracts on the effects 
<BR>
of cigarettes, proclaiming the medical community wrong.
<BR>
<P><P>Her attitude toward art was boorish, uneducated, closed minded and 
<BR>
out-of-touch. 
<BR>
<P>Her ideals were as square as you can get. Unhip, uncool, out of it..  very 
<BR>
germanic/idealistic/super-uber-stiffo. At a secular humanist meeting an old 
<BR>
guy called her an intellectual bimbo. When it came to modern art, she had no 
<BR>
talent herself, nor an art education. Yet she felt utterly qualified to 
<BR>
vilify with great passion, the greatest names of the day, simply because her 
<BR>
understandin gof it was limited. She trashed a whole genre simply because she 
<BR>
couldn't see the vlaue of it. 
<BR>
Her entire outlook was sneering, venomous, self-important and smug. If 
<BR>
instead of spending so much time on self absorbtion she had gone to the 
<BR>
trouble to educate herself on the current artscene, I'd have had more respect.
