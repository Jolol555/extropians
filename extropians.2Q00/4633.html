I agree with what you are saying and with the long term goals. What I
<BR>
don't agree with is the idea of spending your precious years here (which
<BR>
as you point out, may be limited due to you losing the race between death
<BR>
and medical tech) on simple pleasures. Based on today's technology you
<BR>
have a very limited time- let's put it in terms of money- you have perhaps
<BR>
$1,000,000 (say $10,000 per year of life). You can blow your money on
<BR>
gardening for 50 years or you can blow it on developing your personal
<BR>
empire to the point that you just might be able to nudge the medical
<BR>
technology forward a bit quicker thereby helping to save not only your
<BR>
life but a lot of other people who happen to be right on the dividing
<BR>
point between living forever and not living forever. Which, as an
<BR>
extropian, is the correct choice? Do you choose challenge or comfort?

<EM>&gt; &gt;And again no offense, but spending your days tending your garden is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;exactly helping you get closer to the days of posthumanism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think you need to step back and take a good, long philosophical look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at *why* you're an extropian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I tend to lurk more than post here, but if I were to try to sum up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extropian values in one sentence, it would be this: to create and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; harness technology for the purpose of extending the length and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improving the quality of human life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That seems to be a noble and practical goal, until one delves deeper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and asks: why?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The answer is obvious, and can be expressed by saying the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing in even simpler language: we want to live long, healthy and happy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why do we want to live long?  Because we want to have time to do stuff.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Stuff we *like* to do.  That's the &quot;happy&quot; part, and to me that's really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ultimate goal.  We want to be happy *as long as possible*.  That's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;long and healthy&quot; part.  Of course, until such time as life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extension techniques become commonplace, an extropian has some overhead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to attend to: *creating*, or at least supporting research into, life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extension.  But pursuing that goal to the exclusion of all else misses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the whole point of the life in the first place, which is to be happy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If Bonnie chooses to spend a substantial chunk of her thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future years in this world tending to her garden (because she enjoys
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it), who are you to claim that she's wasting her time?  If she has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough financial resources to do so, why should she instead hoard her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money entirely for the hollow goal of life extension for its own sake?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You must also face the sobering fact that you may simply die before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life extension techniques become available.  If that's the case,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hedging your bets and living life to it's fullest NOW (keeping a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; watchful eye on, and hopefully supporting, extropian values) is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly in line with being extropian.
