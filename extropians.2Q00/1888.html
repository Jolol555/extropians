<EM>&gt; As one who deeply respects Gates and Microsoft, I want MS to resume as it

<EM>&gt; has for the last decade: innovative, growing and successful; working within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a system which has none of those facets makes it hard for me to see how it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be done.

<P>Those of us who work in the software field have much more ambiguous
<BR>
feelings about Microsoft.
<BR>
<P>On the one hand, I don't know *anyone* who'd deny that Microsoft is the
<BR>
world's greatest marketing company. But in terms of technical excellence,
<BR>
innovation, and progress, they're complete fuckwits. They've probably
<BR>
put us back a decade, and they've _deliberately_ stifled innovation
<BR>
wherever it threatened them. If you read Judge Jackson's finding of fact
<BR>
you'll get a rather different picture of MS's behaviour from what you'll
<BR>
find in the popular press.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, it's galling to see the US government feeling compelled
<BR>
to intervene heavy-handedly, and even more galling to see them going
<BR>
after MS for basically irrelevent reasons and imposing a silly 'solution'
<BR>
that isn't going to help the situation. I can conceive of anti-trust
<BR>
settlements -- such as the EC one imposed on IBM in the 1980's over their
<BR>
maiframe business -- that would work. (To put it in perspective, when the
<BR>
term of oversight expired, IBM asked the court to continue it for another
<BR>
seven years! It was actually having a positive effect on their business
<BR>
relationships, and the other companies in the field were thriving; the
<BR>
regulation in question required IBM to publish their APIs and interfaces
<BR>
before deploying them. The result was an *expansion* of the market because
<BR>
third-party companies were able to produce add-ons for the IBM kit, meaning
<BR>
the systems could fit into more niche markets, and at the same time the 
<BR>
requirement placed upon IBM to 'play fair' encouraged customers to feel
<BR>
good about buying their products.)
<BR>
<P>Personally, though, I wish Microsoft would just go away. I run a Microsoft-
<BR>
free zone of about eighteen computers, and I *resent* being expected to be
<BR>
compatible with the latest version of Excel or Word by idiots in offices
<BR>
who wouldn't know an open standard if it bit them on the ankle.
