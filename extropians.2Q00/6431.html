<P>I've got Diamond's book, G**s, G**ms, &amp; St**l (gotta be an equal opportunity
<BR>
censor, ;-P), and I thought it was very good. He takes a very broad systems
<BR>
type
<BR>
approach to things, as he should with such big questions, and I think
<BR>
demonstrates quite convincingly *WHY* it was that European civilization
<BR>
happened
<BR>
to have become the most advanced civilization, and it has absolutely NOTHING
<BR>
to
<BR>
do with racism, but with the natural evolution of species OTHER than man to
<BR>
put
<BR>
europeans on top in civilization game. I think this is the reason why it
<BR>
hasn't
<BR>
gotten as much play as more controvertial books like The B*ll C*rve.
<BR>
<P>Its concept of multiple cultures synergizing to reach a critical mass of
<BR>
innovation and domestication are quite good.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The reason I reposted this earlier was that after the fact I noticed I had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quoted something many of us would perhaps like to see less of on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list, &quot;...put another round in the clip...&quot;  etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In light of last weeks flamewar, and the posts on bad PR, I ask that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all read carefully before we hit the send button, which I myself failed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do when I quoted the original question.  No rebuke intended here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at all, just asking all to subtract about 12 dB from anything that could
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; misinterpreted.  Its important.
</EM><BR>
<P>Gee, Spike, first your into surveillance, now you're getting all PC... ;)
