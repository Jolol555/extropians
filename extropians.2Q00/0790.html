<P>Regarding the Saturn 5 plans:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe an FOIA search might uncover something???
</EM><BR>
<P>I know that I've read something about this but I can't remember
<BR>
whether it was one of Zubrin's books (Case for Mars?), or
<BR>
perhaps something out of the Starflight Handbook, or other
<BR>
papers by Mallove &amp; Matloff et al.  But it has been researched
<BR>
to some degree, the problem is finding out who has the most
<BR>
recent info.  This was the mid-'60's so there have to be a
<BR>
large number of individuals who actually worked on designing
<BR>
and building Saturn 5's who are still alive and kicking.
<BR>
<P>Related to this, given modern day CAD tools and the fact that you
<BR>
know the Saturn 5 worked, how much of a reduction over the original
<BR>
effort do you think it would be to take to reproduce the engineering
<BR>
part of the job?  50% less? 90% less?  What fraction of the Apollo
<BR>
effort went into designing the Saturn 5 and getting it to actually
<BR>
work?
<BR>
<P>According to a paper by O'Neill on my desk, in 1975 dollars, the
<BR>
cost of Apollo was $39 billion, space shuttle development was
<BR>
$5-8 billion and advanced lift vehicle development was estimated(?)
<BR>
at $8-25 billion.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sad but true in a lot of places, but I still think this would be easier to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do than making a whole new launch system.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would have to think though, that scaling up the Arienne 5 or
<BR>
getting the Energia to be more reliable would be a cheaper approach
<BR>
than recreating the Saturn 5.
