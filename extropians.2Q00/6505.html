&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This quote doesn't contradict my statement. And did you notice that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the US death rate doesn't seem to fall any faster after the major
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medical events the graph indicates?
<BR>
<P>This is actually kind of funny, given Robin's skepticism of the Singularity
<BR>
and claims of exponentially increasing intelliegence.  I see major medical
<BR>
events, and I see a falling death rate.  It seems rather plausible that the
<BR>
stream of advances allowed the death rate to continue to fall, just as more
<BR>
and more effort allows chip speeds to increase steadily.  (I'm playing loose,
<BR>
since IA is supposed to feed on itself in a way medicine wouldn't directly.
<BR>
But medicine isn't making exponential claims, either.)  After all, advances
<BR>
probably wouldn't be implemented everywhere instantaneously.
<BR>
<P>There's not much drop after polio, consistent with Robin saying it was a teeny
<BR>
percentage of deaths to begin with.  But there's continuous fall from &quot;state
<BR>
health departments&quot; and &quot;chlorine&quot; and &quot;penicillin&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I also see, in the _next_ figure, causes of deaths in the US in 1900.
<BR>
Pneumonia and tuberculosis are each over 10%, strong suggesting that
<BR>
antibiotic control of tuberculosis would make a large dent in the death rate.
<BR>
Diarrhea and enterities are next at 8%; I think these would be controlled by
<BR>
water quality.  Closely followed by heart disease.  Diptheria's the next
<BR>
infectious disease, at about 3%.
<BR>
<P>So eliminating deaths from pneumonia, tuberculosis, the water diseases, and
<BR>
diptheria, would reduce the death rate by 31%.
<BR>
<P>Although pneumonia still shows up in the 1997 figure, sharing 4-5% with
<BR>
influenza, so it wasn't eliminated.
<BR>
<P>Now, the CDC does have an interest in all this, but unless Robin wants to
<BR>
accuse them of cooking the data, this seems good evidence of the utility of
<BR>
antibiotics and sanitation, and their connection with lower mortality rates.
