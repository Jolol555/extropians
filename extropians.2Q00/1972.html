<EM>&gt;From: Martin Ling &lt;<A HREF="mailto:martin@nodezero.org.uk?Subject=Re:%20Working%20Within%20the%20System&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000501190323.62250.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">martin@nodezero.org.uk</A>&gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I strongly advise you to read Judge Jackson's original Findings of Fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the Microsoft case, at:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://usvms.gpo.gov/ms-conclusions.html">http://usvms.gpo.gov/ms-conclusions.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Microsoft's practices have sought to establish and maintain a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the operating system field. They have then used the leverage this has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;given them to establish strongholds in other areas. In all of these,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they have ignored standards compliance, acted uncompetetively to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;point of illegality and in general been directly in the way of free and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;open control of technological development - something I know people on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this list support.
</EM><BR>
<P>The truth of the matter is that what is legal competition as opposed to 
<BR>
unlawful &quot;anti-competitive&quot; business practice is largely a matter of 
<BR>
opinion.  Judge Jackson's findings notwithstanding, it is quite feasible 
<BR>
that another judge, on the same facts, would have found MS not to have 
<BR>
violated the law.  There is no &quot;bright line&quot; in the law to distinguish legal 
<BR>
from illegal competition.  IMO, if there were such a bright line, far fewer 
<BR>
companies would cross it and there would be far fewer antitrust suits 
<BR>
brought.
<BR>
<P>Virtually every &quot;for profit&quot; business seeks to maximize its own profits.  
<BR>
Since the pool of potential customers is limited, capitalism is a &quot;zero sum 
<BR>
game&quot;.  Meaning the more customers I have, the fewer customers my 
<BR>
competition gets.  Thus, any attempt to maximize profits (which is what 
<BR>
*every* for profit business does) is an attempt to establish a monopoly.
<BR>
<P>Apple, for instance, not only wanted a software monopoly, they wanted a 
<BR>
hardware monopoly too.  They wanted every PC user to use the Apple OS *and* 
<BR>
they wanted to be the *only* company manufacturing the PC's to run the OS.  
<BR>
Apple was so confidence in their dominance in the PC space that they didn't 
<BR>
have the foresight to license the technology to other manufacturers.  They 
<BR>
wanted to keep it all to themselves.  Yet, while Gates is vilified, Jobs is 
<BR>
canonized as some sort of saint.  The reason for this is simply that Jobs 
<BR>
was not nearly as successful in his businsess endeavors as Gates was.  
<BR>
Gates' only sin was success.
<BR>
