<EM>&gt; I probably should have specified that the novel in question is a young
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adult sf book - resembling an early Heinlein YA book, to borrow the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comparison Poul Anderson offered of our 1999 YA book, STUCK IN FAST FORWARD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (only published in Australia, goddam it). Characters aged around 15/16. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't know if this will help or hinder, given that plenty of net users must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be that age themselves, and anyway I still enjoy reading Heinlein
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; juveniles. But those kids might not have instant access to credit cards (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; am I way out of date, so, like, this morning?).
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm.
<BR>
<P>A couple of thoughts:
<BR>
<P>1. Price it cheap. If it costs $2 to download, people are going to be less
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inclined to hold off buying it and hope for a bootleg copy. Also, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at _that_ price-point anyone who doesn't pay probably wouldn't pay
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under any circumstances, and is therefore not really a lost sales 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opportunity. (In any event, you don't have the paper/printing/warehouse/-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distribution overheads to contend with, so you can _afford_ to charge
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a bit less than the paper version.)
<BR>
<P>2. Don't encrypt/obfuscate it, but use steganography to track it and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get it removed from web sites or warez sites. If it's HTML, embed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some trackable strings in comments -- or better, in the whitespace
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between words. Then poll the web search engines regularly to look
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for those strings. Brand each download with an ID stamp specific to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the customer. If it shows up on a website via Altavista, you can then
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify the customer who leaked it. Put this in the license up front,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you'll be able to tell 'em, &quot;this is unencrypted; you have a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;license to use it 'just like a book' (harking back to the old Borland
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;license of the 1980's). You must _not_ put it on a file server. If you do,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you owe me a $2 fee for every download and a flat $500 license fee, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will send a debt collection agency after you.&quot;
<BR>
<P>3. This is probably going to work because the _real_ threat to you is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people sticking the work on a file server or CD ROM, not people passing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one copy to a buddy to read (which they do with your paper book anyway).
<BR>
<P>4. Credit card transactions over the net -- talk to me off-list. (I write
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;systems to do this in Europe and can probably give you some pointers.)
