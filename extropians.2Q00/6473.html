Hi!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;JOAO PEDRO SAID: &quot;...One of the major failures of gerontology has been in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cornering where are the causes of aging located....&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;CYMM SAYS: That's not strictly true, Joao. If it's one thing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gerontology has taught us is that ageing - and the diseases of ageing - are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;MULTIFACTORIAL in aetiology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you're looking for one major &quot;cause&quot; and one major &quot;cure&quot; for &quot;ageing&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you'll never find it. The &quot;failure&quot; lies in the interrelating of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;multiple factors to produce a very useful medical model.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're saying that aging is the sum of all genes affecting age-related
<BR>
diseases? I don't agree. I think many age-related diseases evolved pararell
<BR>
to aging but are not senescence. (I define senescence as the basic and
<BR>
intrinsic aging process, independant of all diseases.) And this process can
<BR>
well be a very simple mechanism. Just look at some progeroid syndromes and
<BR>
how simple they are originated; or look at the large diversity in lifespan
<BR>
and aging phenotypes in many phylum (including mammals), if aging had that
<BR>
many genes affecting it, these differences would not exist. There are more
<BR>
genes affecting age-related diseases than are genes differentiating us from
<BR>
chimpazees!
<BR>
As for experimental evidence, I can cite you the recent lifespan extension
<BR>
of almost 40% in mice by changing a single gene (in which senescence was
<BR>
clearly slowed down). Chaos theory says that simple phenomenon has simple
<BR>
origins; senescence is a very simple phenomenon (an exponential increase in
<BR>
mortality from age 19 until age 70), so it can well have a very simple
<BR>
mechanism.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes.
