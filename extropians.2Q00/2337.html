<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heck, you are your clone. The clone is you. The act of
<BR>
knowing it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changes nothing. You can't tell the clone whether it is going to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terminated, or not, because the act of telling would cause a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bifurcation. So you don't know whether you or not-you is going to
<BR>
meet
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the /dev/null in the sky. Even better, you don't have a 50% chance
<BR>
of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dying, because no one dies as long as one copy of the clone crowd is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still present. There is no difference between you both. Both state
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space trajectories overlap perfectly. If one clone is terminated,
<BR>
the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trajectory still continues.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole discussion is about as meaningless as whether it is better
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be dead, or alive. The comparision is invalid, because death is a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-state. If there's no you, you can't decide.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monkey business. Playing with words. Getting trapped in mental
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;states. A new iteration of Achilles/tortoise pseudo-dilemma.
<BR>
<P><P>Assertion 1: I disagree.
<BR>
<P>Assumption 1: Presently, we are all carbon-based 'persons', that take up
<BR>
space.  
<BR>
<P>Assertion 2:  It is therefore relevant to consider copies of both
<BR>
matter-based 'persons' and software-based 'persons'.
<BR>
<P>Assertion 3: I don't believe the matter can be addressed satisfactorily
<BR>
without introducing definitions of 'self' or 'person'.  
<BR>
<P>Definitions: (IMO), 'selves' and 'people' are processes.  They are
<BR>
carbon-based (so far) functions.  These functions are in a constant state of
<BR>
change, on both 'hardware' and 'software' levels.  As processes, 'people'
<BR>
are not only defined by their 'present state' (arrangement of matter, mode
<BR>
of thought), but also by their 'present external conditions', since a
<BR>
significant aspect of their function is to react to their environment.  I
<BR>
consider these 'conditions' to be: the variables (whether they be local or
<BR>
remote, accessible to that 'self's' awareness or not) that affect the
<BR>
'person', at that instant in time.  Of possible interest is the implication
<BR>
that a 'previous self' (the 'person' you were a moment before) both was the
<BR>
'process' and is a 'present external condition'.  Why 'external'?  Because
<BR>
that instant in time is 'external' to the present instant in time.  All
<BR>
'previous selves' are thus, in that sense, external to the 'present self'.
<BR>
<P>Justification for Assertion 1: Since a 'copy' of a carbon-based 'person',
<BR>
even if physically perfect, cannot occupy the same space as the 'original';
<BR>
from the exact moment of bifurcation, the 'copy' and the 'original' are
<BR>
subject to differing 'external conditions'.  As reactions to the 'external
<BR>
conditions' (whether by strict determinism, or by a loose framework of
<BR>
patterns based on random events), since the 'conditions' inevitably differ
<BR>
thereafter, the 'functions' will diverge in similarity from that time
<BR>
forward.  Even if both the original and the copy occupy the same room, for
<BR>
example, since they cannot occupy the same space, they will each see a
<BR>
different perspective of 'the room' around them.  Since the input is
<BR>
different for each, 'the room' will be processed differently for each,
<BR>
potentially invoking different thoughts and different (re)actions. Since
<BR>
these (different) thoughts and actions change and further define each
<BR>
'person', and since each 'person' is also a function of it's 'previous
<BR>
self', it is safe to assume that they will grow increasingly different as
<BR>
time extends away from the moment of bifurcation.
<BR>
<P>Assertion 3: Things that become different are not the same.  ;)
<BR>
<P>Questions: While considering the result of copying a 'self' that is not
<BR>
based in organic matter (a software-based person), I observe that you make
<BR>
the following assumption; the process of copying places both resulting
<BR>
'copies' in exactly similar 'external conditions'.  Is this necessarily the
<BR>
case?  Is this even possible?  Can two virtual persons occupy the same
<BR>
'virtual space' at the same time?  
<BR>
<P>Justification for Assertion 1 (virtual context): The suggestion that it is
<BR>
knowable whether the 'original' was even copied in the first place (i.e. I
<BR>
copied that 'person', there are two now, and that redundancy is going to
<BR>
save my ass) implies that there is some context in which the two are
<BR>
differentiable.  I assert that that contextual difference, whatever it may
<BR>
be, represents a difference in 'conditions', and will therefore potentially
<BR>
generate differences among the 'persons'.  If the virtual 'copy' is in NO
<BR>
way differentiable from the 'original', such as if, as you write, they
<BR>
occupy exactly &quot;overlapping state space trajectories&quot;, then under what
<BR>
conditions could you possibly kill one and not all of them?
