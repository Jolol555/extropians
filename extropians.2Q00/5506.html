</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assets is directly or indirectly held by an individual, one branch or another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the government actually controls many of the functions of the corporation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; I gave an example in an earlier post of a manufacturer of fasteners used in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the construction of nuclear power plants &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     During my career in manufacturing consulting I have on occasion worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with people doing business with some branch of the nuclear power industry.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand the way that the government can almost totally control the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacturing process in that instance.  The requirements in other cases
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where manufacturing is selling to the government are also rather heavy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     However given that many of us remember the fight against the fascists &amp;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nazis and regard those terms as carrying an extremely heavy emotional load;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't you think that calling the entire U. S. economy fascist because some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fraction of probably one percent of the entire economy voluntarily does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business with the U. S. government rather extreme?

<P>The nuclear power industry does not do its business with the US
<BR>
Government, but with the people, it is we who buy the power. Nuclear
<BR>
power should be the least expensive power source, but it is among the
<BR>
most expensive not due to safety systems, redundant systems, shielding,
<BR>
or waste disposal, but because of government paperwork and legal fees to
<BR>
fend off frivolous lawsuits from every whackjob group of tree huggers
<BR>
who ever never understood that you pronounce it nu-clee-are, not
<BR>
new-cue-lar.
