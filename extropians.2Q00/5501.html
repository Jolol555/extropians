<EM>&gt;I've been thinking about writing a novel (which is ironic

<EM>&gt;What I'd like to know is - has it be done before?

Actually, L. Neil Shulmann has written a couple of anarcho-capitalist 
<BR>
novels, &quot;Alongside Night&quot; being the first, a sort of Heinlein Juvie, but 
<BR>
without Heinlein's basic integrity.  I forget the title of the other.  
<BR>
Neither of them were particularly memorable, so you won't have to work that 
<BR>
hard to top him.
<BR>
<P>Then there is L. Neil Smith, who has written a whole huge series of 
<BR>
anarcho-capitalist novels, most of them highly extropian as well, but 
<BR>
written from something of a strange viewpoint.  Smith is a former cop, and 
<BR>
his novels tend to have a whole lot of violence and everyone goes around 
<BR>
loaded for cave bear. You aren't dressed without your peacemaker, even tho 
<BR>
Smith always reassures you about how relatively peaceful anarcho-capitalism 
<BR>
really is.  Smith has a lot of good ideas and sometimes decent plots, but 
<BR>
his characters are generally cardboard and usually talk like escapees from a 
<BR>
bad Western.
<BR>
<P>Then there is Victor Koman, whose anarcho-capitalist novels, starting with 
<BR>
his XXX rated &quot;Space Sluts,&quot; are really bad, but readable if you like 
<BR>
anything that vaguely matches your philosophical bent.
<BR>
<P>Next there is Vernor Vinge, whose &quot;Realtime&quot; trilogy  - &quot;The Peace War,&quot;  a 
<BR>
novella whose title I forget, and then &quot;Marooned in Realtime&quot; - are not to 
<BR>
be missed.  Vinge had not quite gotten up to speed with &quot;The Peace War,&quot; but 
<BR>
it's still a really good read.  However, I consider &quot;Marooned in Realtime&quot; 
<BR>
to be possibly the best SF novel ever written.  It's also where Vinge 
<BR>
explicitly introduces the singularity as an extropian concept - altho he 
<BR>
also discusses it in his forward to &quot;The Peace War.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I think that there are probably quite a few other novels that do explicitly 
<BR>
picture a post-state anarcho-capitalist society, but those come to mind 
<BR>
first.  Unfortunately, none of the good ones, such as Vinge's, tell you how 
<BR>
we got there in enough detail to be useful, so that's certainly a possible 
<BR>
venue for you.
