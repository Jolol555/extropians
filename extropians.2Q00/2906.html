<BR>
THE VITAMIN C CONTROVERSY 
<BR>
A pilot study to ascertain carotid artery status in high potency vitamin C
<BR>
supplement takers by Paul Wand, M.D. Neurologist 
<BR>
The news media has disseminated several articles over the last few months
<BR>
implying that dietary supplements are useless and dangerous. 
<BR>
Negative media hype against dietary supplements is nothing new, as the
<BR>
popular press has displayed a historical prejudice against dietary
<BR>
supplements that dates back to the 1940s. 
<BR>
At a meeting of the American Heart Association held on March 2, 2000, a
<BR>
presentation was made of an unpublished trial indicating that those who
<BR>
consumed high amounts of vitamin C supplements had increased carotid
<BR>
intima-media wall thickening over an 18-month time period.  The doctors
<BR>
who made this presentation described &quot;high amounts&quot; of vitamin C as up to
<BR>
500 mg a day. This presentation contradicts previous published studies
<BR>
showing that vitamin C protects against carotid atherosclerosis and
<BR>
intima-media wall thickening.  
<BR>
<P>In response to this unpublished American Heart Association presentation,
<BR>
The Life Extension Foundation asked me to oversee a pilot study of 30
<BR>
people who had been taking very high doses of vitamin C (and other
<BR>
nutrients) for at least four years.
<BR>
<P>The objective of this study was to ascertain whether those who have
<BR>
consumed more than 2000 mg a day of vitamin C have a greater or lesser
<BR>
degree of carotid artery wall thickening and atherosclerotic plaque in
<BR>
relationship to their age and other risk factors.
<BR>
The results of The Life Extension FoundationTs four-pronged carotid
<BR>
ultrasound test showed that in 23 out of 30 of these very high vitamin C
<BR>
supplement takers, there was no evidence of carotid plaque formation,
<BR>
obstruction (stenosis) or inti-mamedia thickening. Blood flow velocity
<BR>
through the carotids was completely normal in these 23 subjects.

GINKGO PROTECTS BRAIN FROM STROKE DAMAGE 
<BR>
The annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology was the site of a
<BR>
presentation of a study demonstrating the benefit of ginkgo biloba in the
<BR>
prevention of stroke &lt;<A HREF="http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-102.shtml">http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-102.shtml</A>&gt; damage
<BR>
in mice. The damage that follows a stroke is caused by free radicals,
<BR>
unstable molecules that are responsible for much of what we call aging and
<BR>
the diseases associated with aging. Ginkgo biloba is a popular herb used
<BR>
for several purposes among health consumers, including enhancing memory
<BR>
and learning, improving circulation and preventing blood clots. Ginkgo's
<BR>
antioxidant ability led to the investigation of its ability to mitigate
<BR>
some of the damaged caused by stroke. 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>NEW ANTIOXIDANT ASTAXANTHIN
<BR>
Astaxanthin is classified as a carotenoid, the family of over 700 pigments
<BR>
that includes beta-carotene, canthaxanthin and lutein. Although widely
<BR>
found in nature, it is only recently that its health promoting
<BR>
characteristics have been researched. Studies have demonstrated the
<BR>
ability of astaxanthin to enhance energy metabolism and immune function,
<BR>
increase HDL levels, protect against chemically induced cancers, reduce
<BR>
macular degenertion and protect against sunburn. Even more astounding is
<BR>
astaxanthin's antioxidant capability, ten times that of beta-carotene,
<BR>
xeaxanthin, lutein and canthaxanthin, and up to 550 times that of vitamin
<BR>
E! It is able to quench singlet oxygen as well as scavenge free radicals.
<BR>
Its effectiveness is better expressed in the lower oxygen concentrations
<BR>
found in tissues than higher levels associated with in vitro conditions.

<BR>
<P>REGION OF TELOMERASE POSSIBLE TARGET FOR CANCER; HIV THERAPY 
<BR>
Telomerase is an enzyme that replenishes telomeres, which are caps found
<BR>
at the ends of chromosomes that shorten with age, signaling cells to stop
<BR>
dividing. Telomerase copies the RNA within the telomeres into DNA and
<BR>
assembles it on the ends of the chromosomes, thereby lengthening the life
<BR>
of the cells. The May 5 issue of Science reported a study conducted at the
<BR>
University of California, San Francisco in which researchers found the
<BR>
area in telomerase that could be a target for regenerating damaged cells,
<BR>
for killing cancer &lt;<A HREF="http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-027.shtml">http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-027.shtml</A>&gt; cells
<BR>
and for attacking HIV &lt;<A HREF="http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-059.shtml">http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-059.shtml</A>&gt;. The
<BR>
researchers determined that a structure within the RNA of yeast telomerase
<BR>
controls how it performs its function. When this area was disrupted, the
<BR>
telomerase manufactured telomeres uncontrollably, until abruptly halting,
<BR>
resulting in cell death.

<BR>
<P>BLACK HOLES REDUCED BY DRUG 
<BR>
Those of you who hear the term &quot;black holes&quot; and immediately think of the
<BR>
far reaches of outer space will be interested to learn that the term is
<BR>
also used to describe hypointense T1 lesions found in the brains of people
<BR>
suffering from multiple sclerosis
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-077.shtml">http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-077.shtml</A>&gt;. At the annual meeting of
<BR>
the American Academy of Neurology, Ludwig Kappos MD of University
<BR>
Hospital, Basel, Swizerland reported that black holes were prevented from
<BR>
developing in the brains of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis
<BR>
patients by administration of the drug Betaseron(R) (Interferon beta-1b).

Disease Therapy Protocols
<BR>
-------------------------
<BR>
FIBROMYALGIA 
<BR>
Fibromyalgia is one of the more common problems seen in a general family
<BR>
medical practice. It is characterized by muscle pain, which may be
<BR>
generalized, and tender points, which are localized to known specific
<BR>
locations. Unlike arthritis, no inflammation is present and joints are not
<BR>
directly affected. The associated pain may cause aching or burning and is
<BR>
unpredictable in nature. In some people, the pain can be severe and
<BR>
disabling; in others there is only mild discomfort.
<BR>
There is currently no diagnostic or laboratory test to identify
<BR>
fibromylagia. A diagnosis is made by first ruling out other conditions
<BR>
that may mimic its symptoms such as thyroid disease, lupus, Lyme disease,
<BR>
and rheumatoid arthritis. 
<BR>
One study found that 55% of FMS patients suffered from sleep disturbances,
<BR>
and that these sleep disturbances were not caused by pain. Alleviating
<BR>
insomnia with antidepressant medication, melatonin, and/or prescription
<BR>
sleep-inducing drugs could alleviate pain.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-050.shtml">http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-050.shtml</A>
<BR>
<P>ATHEROSCLEROSIS 
<BR>
The most common form of heart disease is caused by atherosclerosis,
<BR>
generally known as coronary heart disease, hardening and/or thickening of
<BR>
the arteries. It involves the slow buildup of deposits of fatty
<BR>
substances, cholesterol, body cellular waste products, calcium, and fibrin
<BR>
(a clotting material in the blood) in the inside lining of an artery. The
<BR>
buildup that results, called plaque, may partially or totally block the
<BR>
blood's flow through the artery. This can lead to the formation of a blood
<BR>
clot (thrombus) on the plaque's surface. If either of these occurs and
<BR>
blocks the entire artery, a heart attack or stroke may result. 
<BR>
A study by Greenberg and Frishman found that 150 mg of coQ10 reduced the
<BR>
frequency of angina attacks by up to 46%, while improving the capacity for
<BR>
physical activity in those patients. That work was published in the
<BR>
Journal of Clinical Pharmacology in 1990.

CHROMIUM CAPSULES
<BR>
The trace mineral chromium has shown remarkable health benefits. In recent
<BR>
studies chromium picolinate has lowered blood cholesterol and sugar,
<BR>
burned fat and built muscle. Picolinic acid is produced in the human body,
<BR>
apparently for the purpose of improving the cellular uptake of trace metal
<BR>
ions. Scientists have demonstrated that minerals in picolinate form are
<BR>
many times more assimilable than other forms of these minerals. 
<BR>
Chromium polynicotinate is an equally well assimilated form which may have
<BR>
even less toxicity and more benefits for certain conditions than does the
<BR>
picolinate form. A recent study on antidepressant pharmacotherapy for
<BR>
dysthymic disorder in 5 patients showed that chromium polynicotinate
<BR>
supplementation led to remission of dysthymic symptoms and concluded &quot;
<BR>
Preliminary observations suggest that chromium may potentiate
<BR>
antidepressant pharmacotherapy for dysthymic disorder&quot;. Another study on
<BR>
chromium polynicotinate in rats prevented the sucrose-induced elevation of
<BR>
systolic blood pressure and decreased measures of lipid peroxidation.
