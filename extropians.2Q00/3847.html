<P><EM> &gt; As a networking/funding/meet people you know or heard about in person type
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; thing it was great.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Too early to form business alliances, though. Most first stage shops
<BR>
will burn out for sure.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; As for learning stuff you didn't already know, I found that the majority
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of the participants were not as well informed as myself or some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; other people on this list. Sure some of them are experts in certain
</EM><BR>
<P>I've expected thus much. Also, the 600+x $ price tag seems to be a bit 
<BR>
stiff for my current financial costume. (Same amount spent on the
<BR>
right books alone would seem to be much better invested, imo).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; fields, but as for well considered, REALISTIC opinions on what the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; singularity or even near-future holds it wasn't anything to write home
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; about. I was surprised at how conservative many of the people there
</EM><BR>
<P>By definition, realism breaks down nearby the event horizont.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; were- you would think these people who are all supposedly looking forward
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to the future and rapid technological change would want more than a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; simple star trekian future. But that seemed to be their outlook... I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; ran across VERY FEW people actually interested in trying to accelerate
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the singularity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Duh. Another data point.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; As for getting a better feel for where Foresight itself stands on these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; issues it was very good. I was disappointed to get the impression that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; they are remaining very focused on nanotech only, rather than branching
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; out and also focusing on other routes to a singularity.
</EM><BR>
<P>True to its name should move on into risk analysis and
<BR>
countermeasures, now that mainstream Has Gotten It. (See most recent
<BR>
Science issue on another neat bucky paper).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; There were some no-shows including Minsky and Kurzweil.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; It was quite evident that nanotech is gaining steam. Technanogy sponsored
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the event, they are a nanotech incubator backed by Ted Waitt (of Gateway
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; computers). Their first project is &quot;nano aluminum&quot;, which in its first
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; application is the creation of super high thrust solid rocket fuel. Think
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; single stage to orbit at $50 to 100 a pound. But for starters they are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; working on refitting stingers and other conventional weapons.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Nano and cheap path to LEO, now there are two speculative topics under 
<BR>
one roof.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; The food was pretty good :-) San Francisco was cold, and had waaay worse
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; traffic than last time I was there in 96.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thank you for your report. Much appreciated.
