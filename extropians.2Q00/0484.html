<P>Me too, and the mother of all monopolization is government. The DeBeers

diamond monopoly would never have been successful without sweetheart
<BR>
agreements with the governments of South Africa and India, and the C in
<BR>
OPEC stands for countries.

</EM><BR>
<P>Let me say something about the most famous government intervention of all.
<BR>
Standard Oil was incorporated in 1974 and its principle product, kerosene,
<BR>
sold for 23.5 cents a gallon. Standard controlled the largest percentage
<BR>
of the oil industry it ever would in 1899 and in that year kerosene sold for
<BR>
7.5 cents a gallon. That's not exactly sticking it to consumers I would say.
<BR>
<P>In 1899 non American oil was not a significant factor and Standard controlled 32%
<BR>
of American oil production and 86% of its refineries. In 1911, the year government
<BR>
came to the rescue and broke the company up, standard was already in decline,
<BR>
it had serious competition from Texaco, Sun, and Pure Oil. Domestic production
<BR>
was down to 14% from 32% and refining was down to 70% from 86%.
<BR>
Internationally things were far worse, Royal Dutch Shell and Anglo Persian Oil
<BR>
(later called British Petroleum) were huge, in fact America was no longer the leading
<BR>
oil producer, Russia was. A few years later Indonesia beat Russia, a few years
<BR>
after that the Mid East beat everybody. What exactly did the government save us
<BR>
from in 1911?
<BR>
<P>It's interesting that by 1917 even the government had to face realty, they were at
<BR>
war and needed as much oil as they could get as cheaply as possible. Believe it
<BR>
or not, the government of the United States of America urged the various companies
<BR>
that had been Standard Oil to &quot;pool&quot; some of the resources and cooperate among
<BR>
themselves more than they had in order to increase production and lower the price
<BR>
of oil.This is pitiful! I'm tempted to make some wise cracks at the government's
<BR>
expense but it almost seems in bad taste, sort of like making fun of a blind man.
