<EM>&gt; How do these figures cash out, Mike? I can only assume you're including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; children (do you really expect them to earn a crust?) and women looking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after children (unpaid, by and large--a scandal, in my view).
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that homemakers should be paid, but if you are the boss, you
<BR>
ought to be able to fire them as well???? ;) Next thing you know, you'll
<BR>
have wives suing husbands for sexual harassment in the workplace...

<EM>&gt; &gt;Demanding that a small minority do all the productive work, confiscating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;half their production as 'taxes', so a majority can live in sloth is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;what is really greedy and inconsiderate. Its modern slavery.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If half the earnings of a small minority is redistributed to a slothful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority, the slothful can't be doing too well. Is it possible that there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't as many satisfying jobs around for at least some of them as there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used to be, when technology was less pervasive and powerful?
</EM><BR>
<P>It doesn't cost as much to live when you are not employed. No daily
<BR>
commuting transportaiton requirements, no need for work clothes, no need
<BR>
for day care, and your health insurance costs are lower because you are
<BR>
not put under working risks.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; More to the point, we need to confront the reality--or so I assume--that in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the near future there'll be fewer and fewer jobs available for those not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; near the top end of the scale. With any luck, there won't be any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toil-demanding jobs at all. What you dub `slavery' sounds to me like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lucking in to a winning ticket in the genomic/cultural capital sweepstakes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If we can't manage a bit of humanitarianism, let's see some noblesse oblige.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would counter that since job creation is a function of the supply and
<BR>
cost of capital, when nanotech comes around, capital supplies with
<BR>
greatly increase while costs will decrese, causing a huge explosion in
<BR>
employment demand. A good chunk of this will be taken up by AI and other
<BR>
computerization, but I would say that until androids are possible, then
<BR>
there will always be a growing demand for human workers.
