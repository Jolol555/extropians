</EM><BR>
<P>True, but where are you launching from? Canada? Mexico? Frankly I'm not
<BR>
worried about sophisticated threats from terrorists. They don't have

this kind of capability, and won't for a long time.

<EM>&gt; Try spotting a helium-assisted electroflight delivery vehicle, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contains essentially no metal, and is 99% translucent. Or, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; camouflage as private aircraft, using teleoperation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Carrying a metallic bomb weighing several hundred pounds at the very
<BR>
least?
<BR>
(BTW: Backpack/suitcase bombs are not that small,  or that light)

<P>A helium lifting device would have to be at least 30 feet in diameter to
<BR>
life that much weight, and an aircraft would not be that much smaller.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Cheap balloon decoys.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; To do what? they have distinctly different ballistic characteristics and radar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; signatures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It should be not so very difficult to engineer decoys which look like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a warhead. In a pinch, just make inflatable warhead-shaped metallized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; baloons.
</EM><BR>
<P>You'd have to make the warhead have the same reentry shell as an IRV,
<BR>
the same mass as an IRV, and its own guidance, like an IRV. The only
<BR>
thing that won't be in your decoy is an actual nuclear weapon, while the
<BR>
decoy takes up as much space and weight as a real weapon. Decoys are
<BR>
dumb.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Armored warheads.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Added weight reduces the total number of warheads you can carry, and makes the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; warhead either larger, and thus easier to hit, or else denser, and thus a much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; hotter and easier to spot target.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course you deploy decoys before atmospheric reentry. As soon as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing encounters enough atmospheric drag to develop a plasma coat,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you don't have very much time to hit it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Terminal phalanx and other systems like THAAD are terminal systems like
<BR>
this. Its obviously feasible, otherwise, why would we be focusing on the
<BR>
terminal stage first?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Warheads in orbit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Easily detectable with xray and gamma ray observation platforms. Allowing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Huh? A dormant, well-shielded warhead? From a distance of some 100 km?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Uh, don't think so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; warheads in orbit automatically allows you to put warhead powered xray lasers in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; orbit, which are far far cheaper and more effective than any other laser
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; technology. Every bomb you use as an xray pump can kill 50-200 targets at once.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Er, you can only align the bomb towards one target. Nuke for nuke,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's quite expensive. Also, it is very, very difficult to destroy a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remote target which is shielded by, say, a few cm of tungsten. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; haven't heard of any successfull xRay laser tests in orbit (duh).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, no. The testing has all been underground for obvious
<BR>
legal/treaty reasons, but they've been designed with many focusing
<BR>
devices on a single bomb.
