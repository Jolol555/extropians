<P>&quot;Al, I believe you may be misinterpreting the results.  Studies with
<BR>
diabetics have consistently shown that maintenance of proper insulin
<BR>
levels extends lifespan.
<BR>
<P>More correctly, I believe you want to say that high *glucose* levels or
<BR>
perhaps high *glucose* level &quot;spikes&quot; (before insulin can be produced
<BR>
to bring the levels down to normal) correspond to diminished lifespan.
<BR>
There is a path, probably highly genetic, involving &quot;insulin resistance&quot;
<BR>
that may lead to a failure of the body to respond to the production
<BR>
of insulin.  That allows circulating glucose levels to remain higher
<BR>
longer, most likely causing more extensive damage.  The primary culprit
<BR>
here *is* the glucose and not the insulin. &quot;
<BR>
<P>Yes, you are absolutely right. But so am I! (I think)
<BR>
In both of T. Parr's works published in Gerontology in '97 and '99 &quot;insulin
<BR>
Exposure and ageing theory&quot; and &quot;Insulin exposure and unifying ageing&quot; He
<BR>
clearly outlines a mechanism for ageing caused by a hormone imbalance caused
<BR>
by elevated insulin levels dubbed the HI-GFE theory (Hormone
<BR>
imbalance-Growth factor exposure theory)
<BR>
<P>I am currently trying to scan these papers as we speak but the OCR is not
<BR>
cooperating due to the poor quality of the copies I have. I will make them
<BR>
available as soon as possible.
<BR>
<P>The points I believe you were speaking to Robert is what I believe to be the
<BR>
opposite side of the same coin, in a way.  Generally, If you have high
<BR>
insulin, you also have high glucose right? (we're talking about
<BR>
non-diabetics here) I am generally familiar with the concept of Glycation
<BR>
and how humans basically cook themselves to death over time. I'm focusing on
<BR>
this hormone imbalance thing first before I attack the high glucose/AGE
<BR>
thing, (See Alteon <A HREF="http://www.alteonpharma.com/">http://www.alteonpharma.com/</A> ) for their work on
<BR>
de-crosslinking drugs) though it seems to me right now that the two are
<BR>
closely related through the consumption of carbohydrates.
