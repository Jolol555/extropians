<EM>&gt; &gt;mother

<EM>&gt; &gt;benefit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Given Mother Theresa openly _professed_ views on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human suffering -- about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; its necessity; i.e., the necessity of it in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; form of the stifling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;poverty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; and rampant disease in Third World countries and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not in the sense of, say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; needing a little adversity to make us stronger --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd think there's a high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; cost associated with even one Mother Theresa.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever there was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;character
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; that seems almost out of a Rand novel, it is her.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I think that Mother Teresa was a deeply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unpleasant, immoral human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being and I can think of no ways in which she added
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world, except perhaps as an example of what not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do, how *not* to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live. I find it frightening that so many people --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even otherwise sane
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people -- think that she was a good person, or dare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not say otherwise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There appears to be a taboo against speaking out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against people like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mother Teresa. Perhaps it is the taboo against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criticising religious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting point and I must take up the &quot;St.&quot; Mother
<BR>
Theresa controversy.  As a former Catholic seminarian,
<BR>
current Zen Buddhist, and, above all, virulent
<BR>
atheist, you may imagine that I have a rather strong
<BR>
opinion on this (and virtually everything else - but,
<BR>
that's just because I'm a pedantic blowhard ;-)
<BR>
Mother Theresa as a person has been criticized quite
<BR>
thoroughly (and accurately) in these posts.  Her
<BR>
personal views on *many* (read &quot;all&quot;) topics were
<BR>
unfortunate.  As extropians, we must understand that
<BR>
the software (Mother Theresa v.1.5 beta) running on
<BR>
that particular hominid's wetware computer was largely
<BR>
culturally determined within the constraints set by
<BR>
her genetic design parameters.  
<BR>
What the hell does all this mean?  It gives us a
<BR>
context in which to understand how she developed her
<BR>
behavioral heuristics which is, of course, an
<BR>
explanation, not a sanction. [Author's note : Don't
<BR>
worry - there's a point coming soon]  Given that she
<BR>
was raised as a devout, pre-Vatican Catholic, we can
<BR>
understand that her moral and social choices were made
<BR>
based on a world-view and set or mores which are
<BR>
largely (at best) laughable to *us* (&quot;us&quot; in this
<BR>
context referring to transhumanists and extropians - a
<BR>
group that is not only more temporally current - like
<BR>
everyone else - but, also espouses highly
<BR>
futuristic/technophilic/individualistic values).  The
<BR>
particular character qualities (attitudes, beliefs,
<BR>
values, and opinions) which were beneficial in her
<BR>
circumstances have become, at best, quaint and, at
<BR>
worst, morally indefensible/reprehesible.  Thus
<BR>
concludes the discussion of Mother Theresa v.1.5 beta
<BR>
(and you thought I was going to defend her  ;-)
<BR>
[That was all just prologue - here's the point]  The
<BR>
far more interesting question is what damage, if any,
<BR>
did Mother Theresa do to others on the planet by her
<BR>
actions.  The obvious answer regarding poverty and
<BR>
disease - and her legendarily impotent stance against
<BR>
it - is quite a lot.  I would, however, argue that she
<BR>
has helped through some form of mimetic dissemination
<BR>
(a good will meme if you please) that we have all
<BR>
picked up on.  We all enjoy helping others (or, to
<BR>
argue the converse, people react empathetically to
<BR>
pain and, as such, seek to avoid it and help others to
<BR>
do the same) and we can be inspired by a dedication to
<BR>
help others.  I believe she did this.  Note that the
<BR>
fact that her method of help was ineffective
<BR>
(bordering on sadistic) is not in contention.  We are
<BR>
arguing deontologically that to see another try to
<BR>
help others both gladdens and inspires us vicariously
<BR>
- perhaps, even to the point of making us more aware
<BR>
of those around us and how we can lessen their
<BR>
suffering.  Stories of her have had this impact on me
<BR>
despite my full knowledge of her less-than-enlightened
<BR>
social politics.  
<BR>
Well - there's your topic!  Discuss!  Now, if I can
<BR>
get Anders to rip into me on this one, then I'll know
<BR>
I'm doing my part  ;-)
<BR>
And, if Mother Theresa was serving the right god - I
<BR>
would remind her that &quot;the road to hell is paved with
<BR>
good intentions!&quot;
