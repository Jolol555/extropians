</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Extropian principles: I was just rereading them in recent days. I agree
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them all, I think, except the first:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1. Perpetual Progress - Seeking more intelligence, wisdom, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; effectiveness, an indefinite lifespan, and the removal of political,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cultural, biological, and psychological limits to self-actualization and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; self-realization. Perpetually overcoming constraints on our progress and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; possibilities. Expanding into the universe and advancing without end.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Of course, I like a lot of the sentiment. Yet, it reeks of modernism;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; perpetual progress? more intelligence and wisdom? Perpetually overcoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; constraints on our progress, advancing without end? All very linear
</EM><BR>
stuff;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as simple as A to B:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     A: Where you are now --------------&gt; B: Glorious Posthuman future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Can't we do something a little better, a little more sophisticated, than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What do you think is 'more sophisticated'? Do you propose that we should
</EM><BR>
endorse
<BR>
<EM>&gt; luddism or technological or economic regression? We know where we want to
</EM><BR>
get
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to, anything other than a straight line is mere dalliance. What is the
</EM><BR>
point?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; People are DYING every day. The longer we delay progress, the more people
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; will die in the future.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, point taken. The problem is, when you are heading for the future, it's
<BR>
very hard to predict where you are going to end up. So a straight line
<BR>
course is very, very difficult to plot. You can try to plot a course to
<BR>
where you want to be, but this can take you somewhere excedingly strange if
<BR>
you are too committed to it; it is hardly ever likely to take you to where
<BR>
you envisioned yourself going (for a reference, see all of life).
<BR>
<P>As I see it, extropianism is much more about people heading off in all kinds
<BR>
of interesting and often unintuitive directions, those people trying to take
<BR>
in some imput every now and then to see if things are working out for them.
<BR>
A good example is body modification; that's not going to be anything about
<BR>
&quot;progress&quot;, well, the technology will be, but not the uses. The Extropian
<BR>
ideal as I see it would be people taking these on as they see fit, and
<BR>
&quot;advancing&quot; (really changing) in wildly different directions based on that.
<BR>
<P>Another example might be social &quot;progress&quot;. The world hasn't really made
<BR>
much that could be called social progress in the last couple of millenia,
<BR>
with the &quot;average citizen&quot; living a shorter, poorer, less meaningful life
<BR>
than ever in history (actually, there is some debate a to whether the
<BR>
average agrarian society citizen, a peasant,  lived a worse life, but that's
<BR>
a wobbly tangent). What society has managed to do is to accomodate 6 billion
<BR>
plus people in a more or less (less?) stable fashion; we (well, not actually
<BR>
&quot;us&quot;) have paid dearly for this.
<BR>
<P>So social &quot;progress&quot; is an extremely ill defined term. But social change is
<BR>
important, and we see Extropians suggesting such quite often, suggesting
<BR>
quite different avenues.
<BR>
<P>Intelligence and wisdom as single scores which can be raised or lowered is
<BR>
cool for Dungeons and Dragons, but a piss poor concept for real life.
<BR>
Multiple definitions of intelligence; well we'll not get into that argument
<BR>
here maybe, but you've got to concede that in the future of intelligence
<BR>
enhancements, you're not going to be choosing &quot;make me smarter&quot;, you are
<BR>
going to be making trade-offs and choosing styles of intelligence. And
<BR>
Wisdom; well, I can't really work out what that exactly is (being after all
<BR>
a rather foolish young man), so I'm not sure how you increase or advance or
<BR>
progress it.
<BR>
<P>So I don't &quot;endorse luddism or technological or economic regression&quot;; what I
<BR>
don't agree with is that we have strictly forwards and backwards directions
<BR>
(advancement and regression). It's just a damned lot more complex than that,
<BR>
and we'd better understand this point before &quot;moving forward&quot;, lest we end
<BR>
up somewhere really crappy. (resisting the urge to Hitler out)
<BR>
<P>Life extension? No question. You live longer, that's progress. I'm cool with
<BR>
that. Remember, I'm Davros.
