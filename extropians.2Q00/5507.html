<EM>&gt; &gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=Re:%20You%20may%20not%20believe%20in%20God%20but%20She%20still%20believes%20in%20you,%20most%20of%20%20the%20time&In-Reply-To=&lt;394DB647.18953061@turbont.net&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The problem arises with assumption of the One True Religion which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; does not exist. Atheism, on the other hand, has the equally silly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; claim that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; since none of them is the One True Religion, then none of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are True.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've seen Atheism practiced with the same intolerant zeal as Christianity or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Scientology.  But the Atheists aren't trying to save souls or to clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engrams.  What, then, would their motive be?
</EM><BR>
<P>The motive is to save minds from self imposed ignorance or self
<BR>
deception. Granted, many people have weak personalities that need to
<BR>
lean on odd metaphors or mass hallucinations in order to get through the
<BR>
day. Belief in a higher power of any supernatural sort to drop your
<BR>
troubles on is nothing more than a low grade version of Stockholm
<BR>
Syndrome or other mental illnesses that arise as mechanisms to cope with
<BR>
stress.
