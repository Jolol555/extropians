<EM>&gt; And we all dispute your automatic and unproven assumption that there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no real competition. Your assertion that the market is the i86 market,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as I have previously said, is also disengenuous, and typical of the big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brother mindset of trying to control the debate by defining the terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beforehand. The market is the desktop personal computer market.
</EM><BR>
<P>Big Brother mind set?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Considering that the big three automakers are all changing over to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; linux, and windows is not certified for secure use in classified
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; projects, most defense contractors that deal with such programs are also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moving over to linux systems, and that most college users use Mac, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well as most all of the entire publishing industry, the claim that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; windows is a monopoly that stifles competition in the personal computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market is laughable.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ha ha.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Now, obviously I think monopolization is a bad thing - so you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; insert all those standard arguments here. What it really comes down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to, I think, is that control of the PC platform is too important to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; trust to a single corporation: there's too much potential for abuse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; and we loose the advantages of distributed economic optimization. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; is an abstract compliant, not one specific to Microsoft. Perhaps you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; don't object to monopolization as strongly as I do, either because you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; think it's unstable or because it's a lesser evil than government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; interference.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Treating an operating system like a utility, where having a standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system provides for maximum benefit for all, according to the typical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; big brother/big government apologist, then an operating system monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be to the best benefit of all. And hell, you trust your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electricity to be provided by one company, your water and sewer are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provided by one corporation. Your police services are provided by one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporation. A government is a corporation, and a monopoly one at that.
</EM><BR>
<P>You know, I actually like living in a civilization. Honestly, this
<BR>
Mad-Max, me-and-my-gun libertarian stuff doesn't really appeal. What I
<BR>
don't understand is why you're so much more afraid of big government
<BR>
than big capital. What's the basis of this business good / government
<BR>
bad thing? It's all just power. If it weren't the US government, it
<BR>
would be someone else. It seems to me if you randomly switch
<BR>
&quot;Gnomes of Zurich&quot; and &quot;BATF&quot;, the ultra-leftist/ultra-rightist paranoias
<BR>
become indistinguishable. The fixation is the same - only the label on
<BR>
the obsession changes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Saying that about linux just shows you have no idea what you are talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about. Because of the nature of how linux is managed in the world, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; virtually impossible for any one corporation to become a monopoly using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; linux. Because Linus put his OS under a public license, anyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offers their own version must make all source code available to everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else.
</EM><BR>
<P>Give me some credit. 'no idea' is unnecessarily ad hominim. Surely I
<BR>
have some idea what I'm talking about or I wouldn't have provoked all
<BR>
this incredible vitriol. Linus still holds the copyright on Linux. It
<BR>
isn't in the public domain. The GPL only protects derivative works
<BR>
based on existing versions - he could release a new version under any
<BR>
license he likes. There's also a very grey area about what happens
<BR>
when vendors start shipping proprietary components in their
<BR>
distributions. Witness all the fuss a while back about QT and KDE. All
<BR>
these concerns are pretty far from practical reality, I readily admit,
<BR>
but the point I was trying to make was I don't bare any particular
<BR>
animus towards MS - rather I object to monopolization in general. But
<BR>
then, you know that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is also a really really dumb thing to do. Different parts of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government have different computing needs, and whether or not those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needs are met by open or non open standards is irrelevant. If you want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Windows to become open, fine, have your big brother government buy the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operating system rights from Microsoft. Try and seize the rights by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forcing MS to make it open is as blatantly an unpaid taking violation as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one can imagine.
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't suggest taking away anyone's rights anywhere in this thread.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I'd like to see a market where I don't buy an 'operating system,' I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; buy a memory manager, a tasking subsystem, a file system, a desktop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; environment, etc, from independent vendors - and they all work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; together because they all conform to open standards; in the same way I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; can purchase a nut and a bolt from two different manufactures because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; they come in standard sizes. I go down a check list getting the pieces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; that best suit my needs and my budget, or I just buy the whole thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; from a system integrater. Now, I don't really think that this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; possible in practice, at least in a pure form, but it's the sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; thing I'd like to see us strive towards.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You really don't know anything about programming, do you? Its 'possible'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but this sort of thing puts such an incredible drain on innovation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because every new thing has to go through a standards body and get voted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up or down by many different people, who all have competing interests,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many of which are against yours.
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite. This is why nothing productive was been done in C since the
<BR>
ANSI standard. What do those freaking commies think the preprocessor is
<BR>
for anyway?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is there any reason why HTML hasn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advanced for jack in the last few years? Too many freaking cooks in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pantry.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah - nothing since &lt;blink&gt;. Man, those were the good old days - when
<BR>
men were real men and HTML was whatever the fuck we said it was.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Bunch a socialist BS.
</EM><BR>
<P>I want to ban guns too.
<BR>
<P>nothing personal,
<BR>
