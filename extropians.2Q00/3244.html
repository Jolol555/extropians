<P>
I would like to add something to my most recent post in which I said I don't
<BR>
take the world's trials as seriously as I once did.  I don't want to seem as
<BR>
though I take the loss of a friend lightly.
<BR>
<P>About four years ago I lost my closest friend.  We'd been friends since we
<BR>
were babies; we were friends in a twin-sister sort of way. Intimate friends.
<BR>
Not lesbians, not that sort of intimate.  But intimate on an emotional
<BR>
level. We accepted each other totally, laughed at each other's faults,
<BR>
cheered at each other's good stuff, celebrated each other's accomplishments,
<BR>
cursed each other's enemies.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Her death was violent and took place under ambiguous circumstances.  It
<BR>
could have been suicide, murder, or just an accident.  Shortly before her
<BR>
death, she told me she didn't want to grow old.  I was shocked by this
<BR>
statement, because I'd always looked forward to being old women together--I
<BR>
was planning to live to be 120 or 150, or however long I could stick around.
<BR>
She was very beautiful when she was young, and as well as I thought I knew
<BR>
her, I'd never realized how important her beauty was to her.  She was
<BR>
growing older and her beauty was fading, and she couldn't bear to take on a
<BR>
new identity as a not-so-beautiful woman.
<BR>
<P>She would have liked the ambiguity associated with her death.  She would
<BR>
have loved it that the cops let the murder suspect carry away the most
<BR>
critical piece of evidence.  She would have laughed at the need I felt to
<BR>
know what REALLY happened.
<BR>
<P>Anyhow, for several weeks after her death I was disoriented.  Sometimes I
<BR>
felt as though I was the one who'd died, and I would be surprised to find
<BR>
myself walking around, touching things, talking to people, having them
<BR>
answer me.
<BR>
<P>I still miss her.  Even now after almost 4 years, I still sometimes break
<BR>
down and cry at what I lost when she died.  But as time has gone by, the
<BR>
wound has...not healed exactly...but sort of grown into something other than
<BR>
a wound, like when a plant grows new roots at a point where a stem has been
<BR>
wounded.  In talking about her to mutual friends I've come to see that some
<BR>
of what I thought I knew about her was illusion of my own invention; some
<BR>
was more...how shall I say?  Real?  Universal?.  To the extent that there
<BR>
was real communication between us, I've found that I'm able to access that
<BR>
same vein in other people (the idea of the collective &quot;database&quot; again).
<BR>
