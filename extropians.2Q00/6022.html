&lt;&lt; I don't know if its fascist as just a typical bully mentality. Two
<BR>
&nbsp;bullies in a playground won't face off against each other, they will
<BR>
&nbsp;find the weakest kid on the playground and make sport of him. I suppose
<BR>
&nbsp;if you look at it in a &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; way, you could make that
<BR>
&nbsp;association, and I'm sure there's plenty of schoolyard bullies that
<BR>
&nbsp;wound up leading the Reich.  &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can somebody help me?  I always thought that Mussolini was a fascist due 
<BR>
to his having split with the communist party over the Italian communist 
<BR>
leadership refusing to play up to the Italian WWI veterans.  On the other 
<BR>
hand the German leadership at that time were the Nazis or National Socialist 
<BR>
Party and not Fascist at all.  My reference for this is what I remember of 
<BR>
the history of that time and Frederick Von Hayek's book THE ROAD TO SERFDOM.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I am hearing that term thrown around in ways don't suggest those 
<BR>
definitions at all.
