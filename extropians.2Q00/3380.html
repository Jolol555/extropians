<P>Goats with spider gene produce webs
<BR>
By E.W. KIECKHEFER
<BR>
<P>MILWAUKEE, May 18 (UPI) - Canadian scientists have implanted spider genes
<BR>
in a herd of goats, resulting in the production of silky strands in goat
<BR>
milk that can be used for sutures and other applications.
<BR>
<P>The technique was perfected by Jeffrey Turner, a geneticist and president
<BR>
of Nexia Biotechnologies of Quebec.
<BR>
<P>&quot;We have combined the old and the new,&quot; Turner told UPI in a recent
<BR>
interview. &quot;The old is represented by the goats and their milk, which is
<BR>
used to make cheese. The new is genetic engineering.&quot;
<BR>
<P>In addition to sutures for eye surgery, the strands - which are harvested
<BR>
from the goat's milk -- can be used to reconstruct tendons or ligaments and
<BR>
to repair bones, Turner said, adding that companies like DuPont and 3M have
<BR>
been trying unsuccessfully to duplicate spider web silk in their
<BR>
laboratories for years.
<BR>
<P>Turner said he has been contacted by numerous pharmaceutical firms seeking
<BR>
to acquire the technique but he said he won't sell.
<BR>
<P>&quot;We may take on a partner for the marketing end,&quot; he said, &quot;but we will
<BR>
keep the ownership here in Quebec.&quot;
<BR>
<P>One major reason for that decision is the fact that Quebec's Caisse de
<BR>
depot et placement, which is responsible for investing Quebec pension funds,
<BR>
has invested several million dollars in the venture. Turner, a native of
<BR>
Ontario, said he decided to base his venture in Quebec because of the
<BR>
province's favorable economic climate.
<BR>
<P>Turner estimates the technology has a potential market of $2 billion. He
<BR>
expects the silk to go on the medical market within a year under the brand
<BR>
name BioSteelJ.
<BR>
<P>Additionally, he said, the substance likely has industrial applications,
<BR>
possibly replacing such things as Kevlar. It also could be used to cover
<BR>
domed stadiums and in the aerospace and communications industries.
<BR>
<P>Both the U.S. and Canadian military have expressed interest in using it
<BR>
for making anti-ballistic defense systems, he said.
