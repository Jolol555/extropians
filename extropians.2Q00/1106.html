<EM>&gt; &gt; I have never thought of the connection with the divine right of kings, very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; interesting.  The social contract between the citizen, other citizens and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their government is supposed to bind us together in mutual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; self-interest.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I didn't sign it, anybody claiming to have seen me sign it is a damn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liar, and you can't make me sign it!  :-) See Lysander Spooner on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; topic.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but have you ever voted? Served on a jury? Held public office or been
<BR>
employed by the government? Served in the military? Said the pledge of allegiance?
<BR>
<P>Verbal contracts are binding on the integrity of the individual. That being said,
<BR>
any man who won't sign a written contract can't be trusted on his word
<BR>
either...IMHO
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I take pride in seeing my nation kick some else's work over when their work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is going to be used for unjust aggression.  Kicking over Saddam Hussein's or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Omar Quadaffi's pile of blocks is no problem to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That Omar -- such a naughty boy!  Omar Quadaffi?  Oh well, whoever he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is, he probably has a good block kicking coming, right?  Or else why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would the U.S. be kicking his blocks?  Must be his fault.
</EM><BR>
<P>Anyone who orders the bombing of a plane carrying hundreds of innocent people
<BR>
deserves to get his own house targeted by laser guided bombs...
