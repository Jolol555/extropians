<EM>&gt; There are certain counties in northern CA whose whole economies depend on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cannibis trade.  The locals make very little effort to enforce anti-drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laws, not because they are personally paid to look the other way, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because EVERYone's business would suffer if the growers were seriously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; harmed.  If you could count on people's self-interest to work this way all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the time, a bit of payola here and there, plus building up the local economy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would keep you going; but it DOES seem to be true that there are people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live by the creed: &quot;If I can't have it, nobody's gonna have it,&quot; who would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destroy or obstruct out of envy, even though such destruction and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obstruction have negative effects on everyone's life, including their own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think many of the people who call themselves environmentalists fall within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this category.  And I say this as someone who has great concern that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human species may be in the process of exceeding the carrying capacity of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this planet.  The most vocal of the &quot;environmentalists&quot; are acting in ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that indicate they're concerned with destruction and obstruction per se
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather than with any love of human-kind.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually most active environmentalists are drifting toward an overt
<BR>
anti-human position. Take the Sierra Club, for example, supposedly a
<BR>
staid moderate environmental group, advocating the draining of Lake
<BR>
Powell, which would place a significant power deficit on the Southwest
<BR>
grid, forcing the construction of large numbers of fossil fuel burning
<BR>
power plants. This is actually an example of their short sightedness.
<BR>
While they might be successful in restoring the original habitat of the
<BR>
canyon, they will be exporting to the rest of the planet the costs of
<BR>
that effort, in the form of more greenhouse gases, that they are
<BR>
supposedly concerned about as well, but apparently not enough.
<BR>
<P>Then take for example the Makah, a small, poverty stricken indian tribe
<BR>
on the Nortwest coast that has always been shortchanged by the BIA,
<BR>
living on a small reserveation. The US govt finally stepped up and
<BR>
honored its treaty commitments protect the Makah's whaling rights, but
<BR>
now the environmentalists are doing their utmost to interfere with the
<BR>
Makah religious practices (the whale is the central deity of their
<BR>
mythology).
<BR>
<P>If you think Kazinski was alone, you are sorely mistaken. When
<BR>
universities in California host seminars titled &quot;Kazinski was Right&quot;, as
<BR>
they are now, then its a foregone conclusion that ecotage and
<BR>
eco-terrorism are now accepted political activities.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Back to the main subject of this post, though--I wasn't thinking of buying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom.  Rather, I was thinking in terms of maintaining low profiles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Inefficiencies in surveillance, that sort of thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Low profiles are good as a first line of defense. I don't keep a
<BR>
security system on my jeep, it has what I call 'urban camouflage', i.e.
<BR>
a couple sprayed over rust spots and some peeling paint. When I venture
<BR>
into the big city criminals look at my car and assume that there can't
<BR>
be anything valuable there...if and when I buy a new vehicle, I'll
<BR>
probably spraypaint a patch or two on it just for grins...
<BR>
<P>THe difficulty with buying freedom is that by conducting the purchase,
<BR>
you acknowledge that they aren't or weren't yours originally to begin
<BR>
with.
