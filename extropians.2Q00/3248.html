<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I know Extropians and trans-humanists love this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;3rd culture&quot; business, but sheesh, this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Freud-bashing is utterly ignorant.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Its funny that most virulent anti-freudians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are the dissillusioned freudians.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seems to me to be a case of them finally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting their phsychoanalytical credit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; card bill, and trying to wish it away by denying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it actually works.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Mind you, some of my best friends are trans-humanists!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But when TOG comes knocking at my door, trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to take away my constitutionally guaranteed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; right to free thought (by trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; banish &quot;2nd culture&quot;), they'll be in for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; big surprise!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'll be packin a mean can o' philosophical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; WHOOP-ASS!!
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Gee, where can I get one of those? I always in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the market for new forms of self
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defense.. ;)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Three things are needed:
<BR>
1. A powerful brain.
<BR>
2. An excellent education.
<BR>
3. The ability to be &quot;unzeitgem‰ﬂ&quot; (common, but not perfect
<BR>
translation: &quot;untimely&quot; -- more accurate translation, keeping in
<BR>
mind Nietzsche's usage: &quot;in opposition to one's time&quot;).
<BR>
<P>(Under #2, &quot;excellent&quot; means, among many other things:
<BR>
&quot;including fields other than the sciences.&quot;)
<BR>
(#3, in essence, translates to the Nietzschean &quot;being born
<BR>
posthumously.&quot;)
<BR>
<P>Key points:
<BR>
<P>#1 helps create the conditions for #2, but definitely can never
<BR>
substitute for it.
<BR>
<P>#2 can permit #3 to occur, and can, to a limited extent, make up
<BR>
for a deficiency in #1. (Some would say an excellent education
<BR>
simply _amounts to_ that which produces #3.)
<BR>
<P><P>With all three in place, let me spell out precisely what you
<BR>
have:
<BR>
<P>ONE MEAN CAN O' PHILOSOPHICAL WHOOP-ASS!
<BR>
<P><P>Warning: as soon as you have the can, you'll want to open it on
<BR>
very different people from those you might have guessed would be
<BR>
the target....
<BR>
<P>Love,
<BR>
Brian.
