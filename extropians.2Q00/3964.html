Dear Extropians,
<BR>
<P>I've been on and off this list for the past 6 years, so perhaps my
<BR>
mentioning  this is unforgivable.  However I could no longer resist the
<BR>
urge to pass it along.
<BR>
<P>Despite its network marketing overtones, I recently discovered a new
<BR>
product and service that is worthy in and of itself.
<BR>
<P>$100/yr gets you:
<BR>
<P>Unlimited Internet Access.
<BR>
15MB Web Space.
<BR>
Web Mail, Calendar &amp; Organizer.
<BR>
Online Web Educational Tutorial (which for some odd reason is their main
<BR>
product).
<BR>
<P>The catch is the internet access requires a task bar with the business
<BR>
name on it.
<BR>
<P>Frankly most of us are internet savvy enough that the product may be
<BR>
redundant.  However this product is geared towards enabling the average
<BR>
&quot;Elmer Fud&quot; to access the web and create their own web site cheaply and
<BR>
easily.  The fact that the internet population is going to explode over
<BR>
the coming decade further drives this product.
<BR>
<P>What especially piqued my interest was the fact that you get paid for
<BR>
referrals.  Although you can only sign up two people underneath you,
<BR>
they too can sign-up two and so on.  Like any pyramid scheme, the larger
<BR>
your &quot;downline&quot; gets the more you keep getting paid.   Since they've
<BR>
eliminating the need for overhead by creating a referral program , is
<BR>
why I'm assuming its so cheap.
<BR>
<P>My apologies if this post has offended anyone -  I'm only mentioning
<BR>
this because I know how much as extropians we place our wealth at a
<BR>
priority.  I've already made $135 off this program in two weeks -
<BR>
thereby paying for my initial $100 investment.  The cool thing is you
<BR>
don't have to quit with your other provider.  You can join just to reap
<BR>
the rewards of the referrals as I'm doing.
<BR>
<P>You can find out more and join if you like at the somewhat poorly laid
<BR>
out web site that you automatically get when you sign up.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Again apologies if this solicitation has offended anyone - I will not
<BR>
mention it on this list again in either case.
<BR>
<P>Paul Hughes

<BR>
<P>P.S.  The guy who signed me up just showed me his latest referral check
<BR>
of $860.
