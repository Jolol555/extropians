<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Just get me ~1.5 worth of critical mass of plutonium (or, better,

<EM>&gt; &gt; U235, machining Pu is really nasty), a budget, and a few henchmen.

<EM>&gt; I guess I was kinda expecting Eugene to be the builder :-)

<EM>&gt; Okay, count me in as a henchman (hope you've read the Evil Overlord's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Handbook...). A budget could be accumulated from others here, or we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might decide to operate some other dodgy scheme to make the cash first.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps we could come up with one that also happened to leave us with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some Pu or U...?
</EM><BR>
<P>Eh, well, assuming you could get the plutonium or uranium, maybe there
<BR>
would be better sites for a blast than smuggled into the US.  Sure,
<BR>
that might make a good test case, but if you can use the sofar buoys to
<BR>
deliver them, then might the mouth of the Persian Gulf make a good
<BR>
target for anyone tired of the less progressive Middle East nations
<BR>
getting so much attention just because they have oil?  (Not to mention
<BR>
that detonating one there would cause much head scratching among those
<BR>
who &quot;know&quot; that a nuke smuggled onto American soil &quot;must&quot; be the work
<BR>
of Middle East terrorists.)
<BR>
<P>In fact...can anyone think of a single target which would cause more
<BR>
damage to a specific group of people?  (The Panama and Suez Canals, for
<BR>
example, would probably cause more damage, but significant parts would
<BR>
be doled out to most countries; a lack of oil would mainly drive
<BR>
efforts to increase oil production at various other sites, and reroute
<BR>
M.E. oil to non-Persian Gulf ports.)
