<EM>&gt;That big Stanford schmooze with Hofstadter, Morovek, Ralph,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all the other dignitaries, it was all a huge elaborate April Fools
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gag.  Bunch of us nerds showed up, some weasley undergrad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;April Fooled us, told us we were all skepticism challenged, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;escaped before we could lynch him.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>That was pretty damn malicious!  I was going to ditch my family and fly in 
<BR>
just for that event, but changed my mind when they announced that it was 
<BR>
going to be web cast a couple days later.  Strange what some a**holes think 
<BR>
is funny.
