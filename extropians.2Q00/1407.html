<EM>&gt; For some years now I've fantasized about a laser fly zapper of similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; construction.  I understand that the focal length of a laser can be quiet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; precise.  In other words there would be no &quot;burn&quot; either in front of or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behind the fly.
</EM><BR>
<P>On the contrary, a narrow laser beam could be dangerous along a wide
<BR>
range of distances from the source optics, whereas a low f-number (large
<BR>
aperture, short distance) system would be defocused nearer and farther
<BR>
than the target point- much safer.  For max power a simple xenon
<BR>
flashlamp would have good conversion of electrical power to useful
<BR>
photons.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; My imaginary device had a &quot;no fly zone&quot; controlled by lidar...said volume of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space would be constantly moniotred and analyzed.  Anything  that flew (all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kinds of insectss) and that was not blood temp(or perhaps a size parameter?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be zapped.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd use several things to discriminate valid targets from clutter, to
<BR>
avoid zapping people, birds, cats, and livestock- although it would be
<BR>
fun to see the dish *watching* a cat, almost muttering, &quot;Here, kitty,
<BR>
kitty, kitty...&quot;
<BR>
<P>Some simple target rules would be:
<BR>
<P>* it must buzz or flutter and be smaller than a hummingbird
<BR>
<P>* the zapper is mounted at 6 ft above the floor and cannot aim less than
<BR>
ten degrees from the horizon
<BR>
<P>* a coaxial pyroelectric sensor would suppress firing if a warm-blooded
<BR>
critter were in line
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If such a device were to be made (I have no doubts that it's possible..but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably a mite pricey) then I'm pretty certain that a ready market would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available around daries, feedlots and processing plants...not to mention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; backyards...
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure that less flashy (pun intended) and much cheaper baited traps,
<BR>
sticky paper, and screens are a more economical solution... but nowhere
<BR>
near as much fun!
