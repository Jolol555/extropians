<EM>&gt; &gt; Ahem. Taxation in the UK is roughly on a par with the USA -- it's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lowest tax zone in Europe, and one of the lowest tax regimes in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; developed world. Welfare bureaucracy is minimal, too. This is the country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; where an allegedly left-wing government is privatising the air traffic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; control system and the post office, and has privatised most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; infrastructure items that are handled by local government in the USA.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was referring to the US on those, but is health care privatized yet? What is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ratio of police to civilians? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Healthcare: if you want private treatment, you can pay for it. There aren't
<BR>
any restrictions on private healthcare. (What there _is_ is a big supplier,
<BR>
funded via the tax system, that has 98% of the market.)
<BR>
<P>Police: not sure, but I think it's under 0.1% of the population. Certainly
<BR>
we hear more complaints about there not being enough police than about there
<BR>
being too many.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've heard that the violent crime rates are up some 28% or so over there... 
</EM><BR>
<P>In 12 months, yes. Note that there's a statistically significant correlation
<BR>
between violent crime and economic performance in the UK. The economy isn't
<BR>
booming by US standards, but it's doing better than at any time in the past
<BR>
thirty years. (Postulated cause: economy doing well == more young men with 
<BR>
money to spend on alcohol. Second postulated cause: those people who _aren't_
<BR>
doing well see more affluence around them and are more inclined to go in for
<BR>
crime as a way of augmenting their standard of living.)
<BR>
<P>What _is_ noticeable is a displacement of crime from surveillance areas to
<BR>
those places that aren't covered.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saying that rural villages are as tightly packed as the larger towns and cities?
</EM><BR>
<P>Nah, just that they're so insignificant (as a proportion of population) that
<BR>
the government and big businesses ignore them -- c.f. the current anti-hunting
<BR>
bill (wildly unpopular in the country, popular with the urban animal-rights
<BR>
people, so guess who gets to win) and Barclays bank (one of the largest
<BR>
acquirers in the UK) shutting all their rural branches because they'd rather
<BR>
put the resources into internet/telephone banking.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 1. Make BBZ's illegal, of course.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;What's this? Oh, its a camping microwave, oh, not that, no, thats a fleadle-o-meter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What does it do? Well, it would be a little hard for a layman like yourself to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand, being a highly technical piece of equipment, but its VERY SENSITIVE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equiment, expensive too. You wouldn't want to damage it at all, inspector. I'm here to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demonstrate it to various parties in the defence industry. Who? Well I'm not at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liberty to say....&quot;
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Try that on your average copper over here and you will rapidly learn how to
<BR>
say &quot;I just have a habit of falling down stairs in police stations&quot; to the
<BR>
local magistrate. _If_ you don't want to make things worse for yourself.
<BR>
<P>(Again, note: I'm not in favour of this shit, I'm just describing the way
<BR>
things work in the real world. The public image of the polite and unarmed
<BR>
British bobby is just that, these days -- public image spin.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 3. Fibre optics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which need to be resolved into digital form somewhere, or else processed in optical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circuits. Using a laser system would work wonders to fry such optical circuits.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Sure. I was thinking of cameras a few metres from the optical head,
<BR>
and some sort of attenuator or fuse to stop that sort of attack. Which,
<BR>
incidentally, is going to get you nailed _fast_. One of the obvious
<BR>
things for the law'n'order brigate to do with cameras is to vigorously
<BR>
prosecute people caught vandalizing them. Another obvious thing is to
<BR>
arrest anyone seen approaching a camera that goes blank. And one thing
<BR>
they _already_ do is put up cameras with overlapping fields of view, so
<BR>
that if you take out one, you'll be on tape via the other.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 4. Neural network detection of suspicious behaviour -- lurking with intent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    to zap a camera _will_ get you highlighted and questioned by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    police. (This latter is currently in active development by, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    example, London Underground, who want to be able to spot trouble on tube
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    train platforms -- like disturbances, bombs, pick-pockets, or potential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    suicide risks.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So I have a HUD on the inside of my sunglasses, and the BBZ fry-o-lator is disguised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as my breifcase. I use cortical scanning to identify targets, the AI of my fryolator
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; focuses the beam on the cameras as I spot new targets, and I simply walk on by....
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Here you're pitting future-tech against present-day tech. I sympathise, but
<BR>
it won't work. By the time you get your HUD and cortical scanning widget
<BR>
and AI, the control freaks will have something better.
<BR>
<P>Remember, they outnumber you, and they've got more money.
