&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; My intuition (and that's all I have on this point) doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find this one-sentence version of the broadcast architecture very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compelling in terms of cost or danger.
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; On controllability, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems that if nanobots can be broadcast instructions, then they, having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; security bugs, can be broadcast bad instructions.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are two different applications of this idea that I am familiar with.
<BR>
One is a strategy for implementing early assemblers - instead of trying to
<BR>
build a full-fledged assembler with onboard control, you build a much
<BR>
simpler device that can be controlled externally by an ordinary macro-scale
<BR>
computer.  This makes the problem of putting the very first assemblers
<BR>
together a bit easier, by making the target machine less complex.
<BR>
<P>The other use is a form of specialization in more mature systems.  Instead
<BR>
of trying to make completely universal nanobots with lots of onboard
<BR>
intelligence, you just build remote-controlled robots with a modest level of
<BR>
built-in smarts.  Then you can have a much more capable central system
<BR>
(either microscopic or macro-scale) controlling their activities using one
<BR>
of several broadcast communications methods.
<BR>
<P>The main effect on controllability is simply that you have far fewer copies
<BR>
of those complex control systems, and the ones you do have can have a
<BR>
correspondingly higher level of redundancy (since they don't have to be
<BR>
capable of moving quickly or fitting into constricted work areas).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Both seemed to indicate that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; today's computers simply don't have the storage or horsepower needed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can understand storage, but given an intelligent program and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glacially slow hardware, why can't it just be really slow?
</EM><BR>
<P>In theory it could be, if you had the storage, but the result would be
<BR>
useless.  What good is a human-level AI that runs 10^6 times slower than a
<BR>
real human?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; John Koza said that in numerous attempts to have a genetic program
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learn to model some tiny aspect of human intelligence or perception,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps equivalent to one second of brain activity (I know this doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really make sense, I'm fuzzy on the details and I don't recall any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the specific cases) that he found he required 10^15 operations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (requiring months on standard PCs).  So, a &quot;brain second&quot; is 10^15
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operations, and this huge number obviously poses a huge barrier to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine intelligence.  Or something like that.  I'll have to watch the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; webcast when it is available, seemed like an interesting point.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, not that big.  There is an experimental 10^15 FLOPS system under
<BR>
construction now (for ~$100M, I think), so it should only take a decade or
<BR>
so for that kind of power to trickle down to the ~$1M systems that AI
<BR>
researchers could actually get time on.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even while listening, I was confused concerning Koza's argument
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vis-a-vis the hardness of machine intelligence.  It seems (as Kurzweil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; later pointed out concerning his speech recognition software) that once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a genetic program &quot;learns&quot; a desired behavior, it can be copied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infinitely, so the operations required to get to a certain level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functioning are mostly irrelevant.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that it looks like it will take 10^15 FLOPS just to run a
<BR>
human-equivalent system in real time.  Evolving it using GAs would probably
<BR>
take years of run time for a much bigger system (say, 10^17 - 10^19 FLOPS,
<BR>
so you can run a population of hundreds or thousands of programs).  You
<BR>
might be able to evolve small sub-components on more practical systems, but
<BR>
putting it all together is a big problem.
