I am toying with that same notion, when considering a paper produced by 
<BR>
Physicist, Seth Lloyd, in his essay, &quot;Ultimate Physical Limits to 
<BR>
Computation&quot;. Interestingly enough, he briiefly examines the notion of 
<BR>
whether a Black Hole can be a computer in its own right, using Hawking 
<BR>
radiation.  Would a 30 x Cray XMP in a flashlight-sized processor be cheap 
<BR>
enough and trouble-free, though?  Massively parallel Computational Marble(s)? 
<BR>
I think one might then get a chance to produce a &quot;soul catcher&quot; as once 
<BR>
envisioned by a British Telcom maven, as well as Hans Moravec. The Yudkowsky 
<BR>
would get his chance at uploading.

<P>&lt;&lt; I propose we look into the future, with the knowledge that
<BR>
&nbsp;in 30 years, we will likely have 100-cray computers in
<BR>
&nbsp;packages the size of a marble.  Then what can we do?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;What about Rosie the maid from the Jetsons?  Given sufficiently
<BR>
&nbsp;high power computers and feedback loops, could we not build
<BR>
&nbsp;droids that could do all the things Rosie did, carrying on witty
<BR>
&nbsp;conversation at the same time?  It is all doable, with just
<BR>
&nbsp;superfast computers and sufficiently sophisticated digital
<BR>
&nbsp;feedback control systems!
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Let us think like Dr. THAAD, not simply dismissing a
<BR>
&nbsp;way-out idea, but rather estimating what would actually
<BR>
&nbsp;be needed to carry out your fondest dreams.  Then let us
<BR>
&nbsp;work to make that happen.  Wooo hoooo!  spike &gt;&gt;
