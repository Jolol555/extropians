<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Actually, it was me who said the first bit (pre [...]), not John.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Locations? Britain (London, Liverpool), Amsterdam, Rome, Venice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Naples, Paris. The apathy toward rape incident occured in London. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Rome my father's rental car was broken into and his camera bag was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stolen, mom was pickpocketed in Venice....
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm very sorry about your friend's and family's experiences. It sounds
<BR>
terrible.
<BR>
<P>I've travelled to all of the above that you listed with the exception
<BR>
of Rome and Naples, plus to other large European and central/eastern
<BR>
European cities such as: Strasbourg, Padua, Prague, Brno, Warsaw,
<BR>
Vienna, Salzburg, Bratislava, Riga, Budapest, Tallinn, Helsinki, and
<BR>
Munich and most large German cities. The conditions were usually by
<BR>
myself, sometimes with my bike, sometimes with a friend or with
<BR>
colleague(s) or a family member.  I usually spent large amounts of
<BR>
time using public transportation (buses, trains, subways) and spent a
<BR>
fair time in train stations, bus terminals, also. And I like exploring
<BR>
out-of-the-way places like alleys, old buildings, too.
<BR>
<P>I'm guessing the reason I experienced no trouble had something to do
<BR>
with where and how I travel and maybe how I look (not as a tourist?),
<BR>
although my camera would pinpoint me as a tourist, but there may be
<BR>
other reasons. (Perhaps it's the garlic :-) )
<BR>
<P>I'm well aware of the tricks that the thieves use on buses with their
<BR>
&quot;distract and pickpocket&quot; scheme, however, (I've seen it), and so I
<BR>
know what to do and how to carry my baggage. And I try to never put
<BR>
myself in too dangerous of a situation or in a dangerous location, and
<BR>
if I do find myself in something that my instinct tells me may be bad,
<BR>
I leave as quickly as possible.
<BR>
<P>Despite your friends and family's experiences, I don't think that the
<BR>
crime conditions are rough in Europe. There are fascinating places to
<BR>
see, and I would hate to know that folks restrained their travels
<BR>
because of what they thought the crime situation was like.
<BR>
<P>BTW, I hitchhike all over Heidelberg and between my tiny home village
<BR>
and Heidelberg too, and I feel very safe.
<BR>
<P>Amara
