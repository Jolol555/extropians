<P><P>(Mike Lorrey)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Served on a jury? 
</EM><BR>
<P>(JW)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;They wouldn't let me.  All because I told the prosecutor during jury
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;selection...
</EM><BR>
<P>Been there, same thing happened to me.  I have since come to the conclusion
<BR>
that this particular situation presents one of the few opportunities get
<BR>
direct and personal access to the reins of power.  So the thing to do is to
<BR>
tell them what they want to hear, get on the jury, and do what you consider
<BR>
to be the right thing.
<BR>
<P>I recommend this to anyone reading this post, and recommend that you pass
<BR>
the word to anyone who might ever find themselves with the opportunity to
<BR>
serve on a jury.  If you care, DO NOT tell them &quot;the truth&quot;, they'll boot
<BR>
your independent-minded self as far away from decison-making responsibility
<BR>
as they possibly can.  Spin it so you get in a position of power (again, if
<BR>
you care), and then do what's called for.
