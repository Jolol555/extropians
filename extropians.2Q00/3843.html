<EM>&gt; I haven't read any reports on the Foresight Institute's confronting the singularity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conference, how was it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>My take:
<BR>
<P>As a networking/funding/meet people you know or heard about in person type
<BR>
thing it was great.
<BR>
<P>As for learning stuff you didn't already know, I found that the majority
<BR>
of the participants were not as well informed as myself or some of the
<BR>
other people on this list. Sure some of them are experts in certain
<BR>
fields, but as for well considered, REALISTIC opinions on what the
<BR>
singularity or even near-future holds it wasn't anything to write home
<BR>
about. I was surprised at how conservative many of the people there
<BR>
were- you would think these people who are all supposedly looking forward
<BR>
to the future and rapid technological change would want more than a
<BR>
simple star trekian future. But that seemed to be their outlook... I
<BR>
ran across VERY FEW people actually interested in trying to accelerate
<BR>
the singularity.
<BR>
<P>The environment and setup for the group discussions was a bit too
<BR>
chaotic and simply noisy. Added to my feelings above, I didn't really
<BR>
find many discussions veering into territories I haven't already seen
<BR>
discussed before in other places.
<BR>
<P>As for getting a better feel for where Foresight itself stands on these
<BR>
issues it was very good. I was disappointed to get the impression that
<BR>
they are remaining very focused on nanotech only, rather than branching
<BR>
out and also focusing on other routes to a singularity.
<BR>
<P>There were some no-shows including Minsky and Kurzweil.
<BR>
<P>It was quite evident that nanotech is gaining steam. Technanogy sponsored
<BR>
the event, they are a nanotech incubator backed by Ted Waitt (of Gateway
<BR>
computers). Their first project is &quot;nano aluminum&quot;, which in its first
<BR>
application is the creation of super high thrust solid rocket fuel. Think
<BR>
single stage to orbit at $50 to 100 a pound. But for starters they are
<BR>
working on refitting stingers and other conventional weapons.
<BR>
<P>The food was pretty good :-) San Francisco was cold, and had waaay worse
<BR>
traffic than last time I was there in 96.
