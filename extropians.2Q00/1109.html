<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  The average high school graduate in 1920 was more literate than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  typical college graduate today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That's why the appeal of the Harry Brown book TOTALLY lost me ... hearken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a better life back then... How good life was before it all got interfered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with by those darn civl rights laws. Hogwash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; People are always going to whitewash the past.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In general I agree with you. However, that doesn't mean you can always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assume the past was worse than the present in every possible way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As it happens, this particular topic has been rather well researched. Mike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is exaggerating a bit, but it is certainly true that in the first half of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 20th century American high schools taught many subjects that are now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered advanced college fare. My favorite example is the fact that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; material colleges now cover in three semesters of calculus used to be taught
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in high school as a matter of course. Much the same thing has happened in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all of the sciences, not to mention literature and foreign languages.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, obviously that doesn't mean that every citizen of the day was actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proficient in all of these skills. It does, however, make it clear just how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far our current system's standards have declined.
</EM><BR>
<P>The average college graduate has a bachelors in business, political science,
<BR>
communications, subjects like that. I doubt you could get more than a small
<BR>
percentage who could quote Shakespeare, Livy, Pliny, Plato, or Socrates beyond a
<BR>
few well worn phrases. I just received a message from a girl on a newsgroup who
<BR>
is a senior in college and is so happy she came out in the top of her class in
<BR>
linear algebra...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Things weren't so good for &quot;others&quot;.  Others have it better now, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not much -- oh yes, and at a cost to the middle class non-ethnic, white
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; America. I know you have heard this before and discount it, but it's my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; POV.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Funding a free high school education for every child in America, using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1920s-era standards for materials, classrooms and student-to-teacher ratios,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would cost maybe 10% of what we currently spend on education. If money had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything to do with the quality of education, we'd have the best-educated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population in history.
</EM><BR>
<P>The year I graduated from high school, 1986, NH had the highest average SAT
<BR>
scores in the nation, while it had spent the least per capita on education for
<BR>
many years, and is still one of the five lowest funding states...  Our state
<BR>
Supreme Court is, at the moment, being dismembered by the Governor, the AG, and
<BR>
the legislature (ostensibly for other reasons, but we all know the real reason)
<BR>
all because the good 'ol boys couldn't seem to make the connection that money
<BR>
doesn't equal quality education, despite our history.
