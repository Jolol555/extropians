Interesting result considering the shape many of us are in.

<P>Abstract:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing rats were examined for the influence of a
<BR>
buckwheat protein diet on muscle weight and protein.
<BR>
In experiment 1, the rats were fed on a diet containing
<BR>
either casein or a buckwheat protein extract (BWPE)
<BR>
as the protein source (10%, 20% or 30%) for 5 wk. The
<BR>
relative weights (g per kg of body wt) of the gastrocnemius,
<BR>
plantaris and soleus muscles were higher in the BWPE-fed
<BR>
animals than in the casein-fed ones, but were unaffected
<BR>
by the dietary level of protein. These differences were not
<BR>
associated with growth. In experiment 2, the rats were fed
<BR>
on either a casein or BWPE diet at the 20% protein level
<BR>
for 5 wk. BWPE intake significantly elevated the
<BR>
gastrocnemius muscle weight, carcass protein and water,
<BR>
and reduced carcass fat. These results demonstrate that
<BR>
BWPE consumption causes muscle hypertrophy, elevates
<BR>
carcass protein and water, and reduces body fat.
