<EM>&gt; &gt; Rather that simply railing against the closed-mindedness of people who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mostly very old or dead now, I bring this up to make a point.  The key
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; element missing in the catalog of mental operations of most of the older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; generation - those now older than 60 - was the ability to think in terms 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; systems - complex feedback and control mechanisms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Taking a page from Papert's Mindstorms, those of us who were lucky 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; work with real models of such - mainly computers - have no trouble at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thinking in terms of systemic variables, but face a frustrating blank 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of uncomprehension in trying to convey our insights to those who have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; such concrete, experiential models in their minds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The way around that, at least in my experience, is to communicate the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;model as a preface to the data.  Sure, it takes longer than just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;communicating the data, but I've been able to get the concept of &quot;x at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time t+1 is controlled in part by the output of x at time t&quot; across to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who barely understood the concept of &quot;1+1=2&quot;, without spending
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hours and hours at the task.  Make sure you understand the concept well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yourself - a good excercise is to state the basic concepts to yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in words an average child could understand - then focus the conversation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the details needed to communicate the point, and show new ideas as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;combinations of what the target already understands (including concepts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only recently grokked during your conversation).  (Proceeding from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;basics to the advanced, never ever delving into jargon or concepts you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have not already defined, to yourself also makes good practice for this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It can also help you comprehend stuff you're not quite comfortable with;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just break down info about it into such an explanation and repeat it to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yourself.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, yes, I'm very familiar with all the above, really, although it is good 
<BR>
advice for those who haven't thought about such matters.  This only works, 
<BR>
however, if the other party is willing to take the time to seriously listen 
<BR>
and try to comprehend something new.  When you're the &quot;expert,&quot; then 
<BR>
sometimes other people will stop and really listen.  But when THEY are the 
<BR>
expert with decades of experience - they have usually developed some 
<BR>
intensely serious systems of screening out data that they've already decided 
<BR>
must be nonsense, and the fact that you're some 20-something amateur is not 
<BR>
likely to get you past the polite 30 seconds of pretending to listen.  I 
<BR>
recall being treated as a harmless nut for suggesting to the anti-aging 
<BR>
luminaries of the time that the aging clock hypothesis might have something 
<BR>
to it in the late '70's.
