<P>[regarding &quot;smart gun&quot; technology:]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't discount the possibility, and if such is possible (it likely is) I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  adamantly say that it should not be mandated until the technology can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  integrated into any gun of any price teir. 
</EM><BR>
<P>There are two different questions here.  The first is the general question of 
<BR>
whether an extropian should support pursuit of &quot;smart gun&quot; technology and the 
<BR>
other is whether it should be mandated by law at some stage of the 
<BR>
technology's development.  Regarding your point on the first question, Mike, 
<BR>
I think there would be good reasons to implement the technology, once it is 
<BR>
sufficiently robust and flexible, in new weapons, even if it can't be 
<BR>
practically retrofitted into older guns.  This is no different that seeking a 
<BR>
new car with airbags and seatbelts, even though it is impractical or even 
<BR>
undesirable to install those devices in older cars.  I dream of one day 
<BR>
having a &quot;full set&quot; of Corvettes - at least one from each of the five major 
<BR>
generations (to date).  It would be blasphemy to retrofit a well-preserved 
<BR>
1957 Corvette with seatblets, airbags and active handling control.  But that 
<BR>
doesn't stop me from expecting to find such devices in a 2000 model year C-5. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Likewise, it's hard to imagine that I would ever want to retrofit my 
<BR>
mint-condition 1953 SKS with a &quot;smart-gun&quot; module.  (But I can see putting 
<BR>
one on my later-model Chinese SK that's already been pretty well bastardized 
<BR>
into a utilitarian saddle-pack brush gun.)
<BR>
<P>The other question - mandating &quot;smart gun&quot; tech by law - isn't NECESSARILY a 
<BR>
simple binary one of intrusive state power versus the liberty of gun owners.  
<BR>
The common law of negligence can act as an evolutionary motor for &quot;mandating&quot; 
<BR>
incremental employment of improved safety devices through changing 
<BR>
perceptions of &quot;state of the art&quot; and the gradual imposition of civil 
<BR>
liability on those who do not keep up and thereby cause harm to others.  In 
<BR>
this regard I point you to my discussion of the use of this principle by the 
<BR>
distinguished Judge Learned Hand (yes, there was such a man) in the 
<BR>
celebrated case of The T.J. Hooper.  You can find a discussion of this 
<BR>
process and the T.J. Hooper case in a paper I delivered at the 1998 Foresight 
<BR>
Senior Associates Gathering:

<BR>
<P>Thus I can envision a time when it would be negligent to not make a weapon 
<BR>
that was &quot;loyal&quot; to its owner.  It might well not be considered negligent to 
<BR>
&quot;upgrade&quot; legitimate antique weapons, but the standards for their use would 
<BR>
then be much higher.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The fact is that the 'smart'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  technologies that are out right now are highly restrictive, highly prone to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  failure, and add a minimum of $1000.00 on the price of any given gun. When 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  average pistol costs $350.00-450.00, putting what amounts to a 200% tax on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  gun only does one thing: it makes it impossible for poor people, who are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  likely to live in high crime areas and are most freqently victims of crime 
</EM><BR>
(
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  are most likely of a minority group), to defend themselves against crime. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is an elitist and racist policy to propose until it can be afforded by 
</EM><BR>
all. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  dirty little secret of the Democratic Party is that most gun control laws 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; passed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  prior to 1950 were part of Jim Crow legislation. What cop is gonna let a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; black
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  man carry a gun?
</EM><BR>
<P>All these points fit neatly into the kind of analysis one finds in the T.J. 
<BR>
Hooper: You make a good case that the technology has not yet evolved to the 
<BR>
point where we can fairly consider it to be the state of the art.  On the 
<BR>
other hand, such arguments shouldn't be taken to be conclusive against the 
<BR>
impetus to continue developing that art - which I don't think you do.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Back to the cost: Those that claim the logic can be designed into a single 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chip
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and made for a few cents are thinking in the wrong scale. Chip 
</EM><BR>
efficiencies 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  scale of this magnitude occur when you reach hundreds of thousands, if not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  millions of units each year. While a couple million guns are sold each 
</EM><BR>
year 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the US at most, they are made by several dozen gun manufacturers. Each one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  these manufacturers will have to come up with its own chip design (if not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  multiple chip designs), since sharing designs like this is collusion and an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  anti-trust actionable offense. Each manufacturer will never make more than 
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  hundred thousand or so chips a year. For those of you in chip design, who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  want to advance gun technology so that it is affordable, I suggest you 
</EM><BR>
make 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  chip design, and make it free and open source like linux is, start 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacturing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  up, and get the prices down. And design it so that the government can't 
</EM><BR>
use 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  as a means of gun control/registration/permitting.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you're right about all this, but that an advanced MEMS robotics 
<BR>
technology could make a &quot;smart trigger guard&quot; practicable at a reasonable 
<BR>
cost.  Sketching designs for such devices in my mind has become a drive-time 
<BR>
pastime for me lately.  A key to this would be the development of a 
<BR>
general-purpose &quot;recognizer&quot; chip, that would have uses in many applications 
<BR>
beyond &quot;smart gun&quot; tech, and therefore could become inexpensive with 
<BR>
economies of scale from general demand from those other uses.  This would be 
<BR>
coupled with a &quot;trigger-inhibitor&quot; arm that would consist of an array of MEMS 
<BR>
lever arms.  This latter device would also be able to use many components 
<BR>
that would be useful in broader applications.  The only unique characteristic 
<BR>
would be the general arrangement of these components.  Newly manufactured 
<BR>
weapons could incorporate these components seamlessly into the general body 
<BR>
of the firearm, while retrofit kits might be somewhat more clunky.  In any 
<BR>
case, I don't see why a smart gun couldn't become an acceptable definition of 
<BR>
the state of the art in time.
