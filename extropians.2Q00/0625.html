<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; difference.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;In the USA perhaps, what about the oil company that torched a load of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; villages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in Africa that were protesting against some development (cant remember
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;exact details),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe that was Chevron in Nigeria.  WBAI did an expose on it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;or the slash and burn farming cartels in south america ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm unfamiliar with that example, though Pacific Fruit had a long history
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; paramilitary operations in Latin America.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;examples of companies 'oppressing' people by sending men with guns to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;murder the opposition.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This does happen, to be sure, but the cases where it does happen are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; peripheral and unlikely to happen in a developed nation especially if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizenry is well armed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Government/Business - only difference is the amount of power they can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wield.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True, though I would say that to the degree a business uses force, it is
</EM><BR>
no
<BR>
<EM>&gt; longer acting as a business on a free market, but is becoming the
</EM><BR>
equivalent
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of a government -- whether it be small time like a local mob or big time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like bankrolling a coup or a revolution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I think what Billy Brown was getting at was something like this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yesterday, I visited a friend of mine in Brooklyn.  We went out to eat and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; checked several restaurants before settling on a Thai place over on Park
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Slope.  We even went into two before settling on that one.  At no time did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone chase us down the street or threaten our very lives.  You just
</EM><BR>
don't
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have that kind of exit power with governments.  (Yeah, sure, one can move
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Canada if one doesn't like the US, but it's just not the same.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, government is defined basically by its ability to use force,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specifically in a given area.  A government that does not use force is
</EM><BR>
like
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a tiger without teeth and claws.  (This is ignoring, for the moment, when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and how a government should use force -- or whether there should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governments at all.)  When Chevron helped to attack villagers in Nigeria,
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; was acting as a government would.  It was able to do this because, for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most part, the Nigerian government is too busy trying to consolidate its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power (parts of the country want to secede) and it's extremely corrupt.
</EM><BR>
(If
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Chervon had tried the same tactics in, say, Japan or Iran, in
</EM><BR>
contradiction
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to the governments there, what do you think would've happened?  If Chevron
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't get the help of another government, chances are it would lose and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lose face.)
