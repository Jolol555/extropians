</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Clearly, in the ordinary party setting, only those present for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussion get to hear what is said and contribute.  By preserving the gist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on whiteboard or paper, the ideas become available to be worked on by all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;An elegant, almost embarrassingly obvious way of enhancing the event.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The holding of a conference in a semi-posh setting--hotel with meeting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rooms and catered dinners--is familiar as the conventional &quot;way it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;done&quot;.   It needs no rocket scientist to conceive of alternative, less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expensive, ways of accomplishing the same end.  On motorcycle rides through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the hills of the California central coast (not all that far from Asilomar,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in fact), I have often stumbled upon underused rustic park facilities which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could easily accomodate a campout/cookout variation of the conventional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conference, some even with substantial accomodations and meeting halls.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;am certain that the various list members know of similar facilities in each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of their various locales.  This is doable on the cheap and on the cheaper.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In fact, taking it to something of an extreme, the cost can be so low in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;terms of food and lodging, that even the expense of bringing special
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;friends from faraway (and not so faraway) places might be subsidized at not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unreasonable expense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What it takes more than anything is the will, some leadership, some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cooperation, and a modicum of organization.  But it's a great idea.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Before I put this post to rest, one last comment.  As enthralled by these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;futurist events as I am, I have entertained the idea of taping them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prefessionally and packageing them for wider media distribution--the Extro
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;TV idea.  (I pitched this idea to the Alcor folks re the upcoming Life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Extension conference, but they turned me down.)  This same possibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exist re the independently organized retreat/seminar/party/poster event.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sometimes these things can really be made to click.  A local SF fan group, 
<BR>
the &quot;Jedi Knights,&quot; used to have marvelous monthly events - sometimes even 
<BR>
more often.  For years, they went to Big Bear for the weekend, had serious 
<BR>
water battles in the local parks, excursions to Universal City, boatings, 
<BR>
the Renaissance Faire, amazing parties, you-name-it.  The costs per member 
<BR>
were astonishingly minimal.  I rarely spent more than $10 on an outing that 
<BR>
might last two days.  It was all volunteer effort.  I only dropped out 
<BR>
because I just couldn't afford the time.
<BR>
