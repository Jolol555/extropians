Subject: Re: Cryonics &amp; psychopharmacology
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A few weeks ago, someone challenged Damien about being signed up for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Cryonics.  His reply (included below, since it's been awhile) was that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he doubts that current cryonics technology will lead to viable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;freezings.  I think that misses one of the points about signing up now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You should buy insurance now so you can afford to get frozen when you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;older, insurance would be more expensive, and the technology will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;better.
</EM><BR>
<P>Insurance might be cheaper when you're older since the cryonics technology
<BR>
might have better economy of scale, and 'better' technology might not mean
<BR>
more expensive .....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you don't buy the insurance now, it's much harder to afford later.
</EM><BR>
<P>But maybe a more logical approach is to cover costs from your Will. My
<BR>
entire estate can support the cryonics cost at point of purchase, surely? Or
<BR>
do you need to do a lot of medicals/ booking/ preparation?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;If you're already in a position that you can set aside the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;appropriate amount of money now, you don't have to worry about getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the insurance now.  Signing up now gives a boost to the people working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the technology now.  You wouldn't want them to stop working on it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would you?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I think this is a good point, although maybe they should direct their
<BR>
marketing at 'silver surfers' and folks near to death's door (who can pay
<BR>
cash and don't need insurance) rather than relative youngsters.
