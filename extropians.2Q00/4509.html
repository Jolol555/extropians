<P><EM> &gt; What if there is a convention adopted by the entities involved that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; unconstrained replication is not allowed.  Any unconstrained replication
</EM><BR>
<P>This assumes monoculture, or a singularly powerful all-controlling
<BR>
species (and I do really mean singularly powerful). Even if such a
<BR>
thing would be possible (without self-destruction, as a trivial
<BR>
solution) is not obvious. I mean, how a Darwinian system can leave the

evolutionary regime, that does not follow.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; is viewed as a threat and is prevented.  Some entities would like to

<EM> &gt; replicate, but they cannot.  Most do not want to replicate, and attempt
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to prevent others from doing so.

<BR>
A mechanism? Both for action, and how an evolutionary regime can be
<BR>
stripped? 
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; This is a common theme explored in science fiction, where in an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; overpopulated world there are laws regulating the number of children.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; A moderate form of this is supposedly already being practiced in China.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; It seems to me that this would be a stable situtation, and one which
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; might be adopted because it produces a better outcome for the participants
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; than they would get in a world of unconstrained replication.
</EM><BR>
<P>Two ifs. How to get there from here, and how to enforce the mutation ban.
