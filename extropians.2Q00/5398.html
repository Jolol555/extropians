&quot;Terry W. Colvin&quot; forwarded:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I am only amazed that a terrorist group has not yet used this method!
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The problem is that you don't know exactly WHERE your buoy is going.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not to come down on either side of the buoy-bomb, but a terrorist might not
<BR>
be too picky.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The second problem is that spy satellites can pretty easily spot weapons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sized lumps of radioactive materials unless kept in a hefty lead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;containment system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Totally, absolutely untrue.   Satellites are more that 100 km from the
<BR>
ground, the air provides the same amount of shielding as 10 meters of
<BR>
water -- if the bomb is underwater, that just adds more shielding -- and
<BR>
bombs aren't all that radioactive to begin with.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Then you've also got the sonar nets that girdle the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;US. Anything that is metallic and is below the surface gets tracked when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it comes within a certain range.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, untrue. The SOSUS arrays listen for noise generated by submarines and
<BR>
ships.  The only way the proposed constant-depth drifter buoy would be
<BR>
detected is by a ship's active sonar, and, AFAIK,  those are infrequently
<BR>
used.  Or a hapless submarine might chance to bump into it, I suppose.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
But it's just around the corner. It's been in development for the past
<BR>
decade or more.
<BR>
<P>Testing was done with the ALEXIS and FORTE sats and CALIPOE systems to develop
<BR>
multi-spectral thermal imaging for the detection of nuclear materials for arms
<BR>
proliferation uses. 3 or 4 years ago they were able to detect radioactive dust
<BR>
in processing plants. And that's just the non-secret stuff. Although I still
<BR>
think detection of a bomb will be a few years off, it will happen soon. there
<BR>
are already &quot;sniffers&quot; in Washington, the Panama Canal and other places and
<BR>
once they have detection down with sattelites (if we don't already), next step
<BR>
will be tracking of materials, then bombs.

<BR>
<P>Given a million to one odds, they could be detected by magnetic anomoly
<BR>
detectors in a ship or helicopter, but only by chance and even if so, they
<BR>
probably wouldn't think a thing about it. About the same odds of a sub bumping
<BR>
into it unless, of course, they were looking for it and knew where to look.

<BR>
<P>UFO said
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But it's just around the corner. It's been in development for the past
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decade or more.
</EM><BR>
<P>If, as I think, we're talking about detecting the radiation given off by a
<BR>
nuclear bomb before it explodes, we'll never, ever have the capability of
<BR>
doing that from space, simply because there's nothing to detect outside the
<BR>
atmosphere if the bomb is on the ground. It's that 10-meters of water
<BR>
equivalent screening, plus the low radioactivity of bombs that gets you. The
<BR>
100+ km stand-off range doesn't help either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Testing was done with the ALEXIS and FORTE sats and CALIPOE systems to
</EM><BR>
develop &gt;multi-spectral thermal imaging for the detection of nuclear
<BR>
materials for arms proliferation &gt;uses. 3 or 4 years ago they were able to
<BR>
detect radioactive dust in processing plants. And &gt;that's just the
<BR>
non-secret stuff. Although I still think detection of a bomb will be a few
<BR>
years &gt;off, it will happen soon. there are already &quot;sniffers&quot; in Washington,
<BR>
the Panama Canal and &gt;other places and once they have detection down with
<BR>
sattelites (if we don't already), next &gt;step will be tracking of materials,
<BR>
then bombs.
<BR>
<P>Forte and Alexis are helping to develop new techniques applicable to the
<BR>
detection of nuclear explosions, a different and generally easier task than
<BR>
we're talking about. See &lt; <A HREF="http://www.fas.org/irp/news/1997/forte_pr.htm">http://www.fas.org/irp/news/1997/forte_pr.htm</A> &gt;.
<BR>
<P>CALIOPE is indeed intended for remote chemical diagnostics to help detect
<BR>
and diagnose WMD production and possibly storage facilities.  But it has no
<BR>
application in finding an assembled nuclear weapon.
<BR>
<P>I try to avoid being dogmatic about such things, but it's appropriate in
<BR>
this case: *There is no known physical principle that would allow the
<BR>
radiation from an unexploded nuclear weapon on the ground to be detected
<BR>
above the atmosphere, because the radiation doesn't escape through the
<BR>
atmosphere.*    Now if the weapon possess other signatures, such as being
<BR>
mounted on an ICBM sitting on a pad, or being in a crate labled &quot;NUCLEAR
<BR>
BOMB -- USE NO HOOKS,&quot; or having a radio transmitter attached to it,  then
<BR>
satellites could help.
<BR>
<P>BTW, you're right that ground-based or helicopter-mounted radiation
<BR>
(gamma-neutron) detectors can detect the radiation of a weapon, but
<BR>
generally only at ranges of a few tens of meters.  Back in the mid-1970s
<BR>
there was a flap when gamma-neutron detectors the US had installed in the
<BR>
Bosporus registered radioactivity from transiting Russian freighters.
<BR>
AFAIK, the affair kind of died without resolution.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Given a million to one odds, they could be detected by magnetic anomoly
</EM><BR>
detectors in a &gt;ship or helicopter, but only by chance and even if so, they
<BR>
probably wouldn't think a thing &gt;about it. About the same odds of a sub
<BR>
bumping into it unless, of course, they were
<BR>
<EM>&gt;looking for it and knew where to look.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I agree.   If some sort of advanced warning were received,  ships and
<BR>
aircraft could be deployed into the anticipated drift path to search with
<BR>
sonar and MAD and might have a decent chance of finding the infernal buoy.
<BR>
But if there were no warning, forget it.
