<P><EM> &gt; As I've said before, almost everyone I have known personally that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; has visited europe has been robbed at least once while they were
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; there, they've had their hotel rooms robbed, their cars broken into or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; stolen, and bags snatched out of their hands.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Europe is a quite large, heterogenous place. 
<BR>
<P>Blanket statements are less then helpful here. Clearly there is
<BR>
criminal industry catering to the tourists (=easy pickuhns), but it
<BR>
really depends on where you go. A touristy street in Mezzogiorno (or
<BR>
parts of France?) is *not* a walled community near a police department
<BR>
in the U.S., or, say rural South Carolina. Parts of Eastern Europe are
<BR>
notorious (I think Prague can be nasty, let Robert tell about Moscow),
<BR>
though, as usually, not being stupid really helps.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; The brazenness of theives in europe to me is incredible, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; testament to the fact that they know there is little a person can do
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to defend themselves against robbery in europe. I've heard many
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course you can, you can use mace and tasers, and just plain
<BR>
physical force (also, it is always advisable to call for help,
<BR>
*loudly*, especially if you're a woman). If you're travelling, it
<BR>
really helps to know the basic survival vocabulary of the country
<BR>
you're currently in. Notice that you will be very unlikely to
<BR>
encounter firearms in the hands of thugs there (but do not
<BR>
underestimate cold steel in the hands of a professional, or the
<BR>
confusing aspects of a head concussion). I don't know whether ATM
<BR>
robberies are really widespread in parts of Europe, but I really doubt
<BR>
it. In any case, refuse to be whisked away even if you're facing a
<BR>
firearm point blank, all the scary stuff happens elsewhere, where you
<BR>
can't call for help, and the criminal has a lot more time. The latter
<BR>
points are more or less universal, though probably more U.S.-centric.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; stories of women mugged and raped with bystanders just walking by,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; ignoring what went on. Non-gun crime is so prevalent I believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; most people there just don't see it, or refuse to see it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know, overwhelmingly most of Europe looks safer than urban
<BR>
areas with a lot of gangbangers. Oh, yes, and be very careful when you
<BR>
travel to Scandinavia. Extremely dangerous people up there, just look
<BR>
at Anders.
