<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A minor criticism first: the title of the paper seems unnecessarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opaque: &quot;Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with Public Policy Recommendations.&quot;  Here we have two unfamiliar terms,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;ecophagy&quot; and &quot;biovorous&quot;.  As far as I know these are coined terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which you will not find in the dictionary or the technical literature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (they do seem to have been used in some science fiction computer games).
</EM><BR>
<P>Hal is correct and Robert is a wordsmith.  However those are not
<BR>
reasons to object to the quantitative aspects of the paper.
<BR>
Doing so falls into the &quot;Scientific American pitfall&quot; of attacking
<BR>
the style or author when you cannot attack the technological discussion.
<BR>
Since Hal attempts to do this (below), I will put the above comments
<BR>
in the &quot;I didn't like the style&quot; editorializing arena.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; While the meaning of these words can be deduced from the root forms,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and &quot;ecophagy&quot; is defined at least indirectly in the introduction, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leaves me with the impression that jargon is being used unnecessarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to add political impact.
</EM><BR>
<P>It isn't politics.  Robert has had this style for ~20+ years of writing
<BR>
that I've reviewed his papers.  It is more along the lines of the
<BR>
&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; -- &quot;A word means exactly what I intend it to
<BR>
mean, nothing more, nothing less&quot; (paraphrasing on my part).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've heard of Drexler gloatingly putting up slide after slide of dense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equations from Nanosystems, to tweak his earlier critics who complained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that Engines lacked technical depth.  I can just imagine the glee with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which Foresight presentations will quote the mouthful of a title with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which this paper has been burdened.
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert actually pushed Foresight to restrain itself from commenting on Joy's
<BR>
perspective until there were some numbers on which productive discussion
<BR>
&quot;could&quot; be based.  I agree that the title is burdensome, but it serves
<BR>
as a much greater academic effort than Joy's fear-mongoring.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Well, that is absurd.  It will only take 20 months if the goo expects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to take over the biosphere without anyone noticing!  Don't you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone would notice?  Hey, we just lost New York.  Naw, couldn't be,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the global temperature hasn't gone up more than four degrees.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Obviously the goo can't help being detected at some point.  The 20 month
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scenario just doesn't make sense.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  The point of the paper is to define limits.  There were
<BR>
discussions behind the scenes on discussing the relative advancement
<BR>
rates in different environments, but the assumptions and equations
<BR>
rapidly become more complex than this paper could have dealt with.
<BR>
<P>The paper sets some general limits.  If potential nano-takeover becomes
<BR>
apparent at an earlier date (Oh my god, Hal has disappeared from the
<BR>
face of the planet, he must have been consumed by biovorous nanobots...)
<BR>
then that is fine.  There is no discussion of the things nanobots
<BR>
must avoid consuming to keep humans from suspecting that something
<BR>
is amiss.  The general analysis is one in which nanotech seeks
<BR>
to remain as unobserved for as long as possible.  There is ample
<BR>
room for subsequent studies to take the paths of &quot;natural&quot; biovorus
<BR>
replicators that do not care whether they are observed and &quot;synthetic&quot;
<BR>
biovorus replicators designed to be a stealthy as &quot;current&quot; technology
<BR>
allows.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A more plausible scenario is described where the gray goo grows somewhat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faster and the temperature is allowed to rise more: &quot;For example, taking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; t = 100 sec, TEarth = 300°K, and Ediss ~ 100 MJ/kg, the transition to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ETPL regime occurs when total global nanomass reaches ~5 ×1010 kg,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or only 0.001% of total global biomass, and the last ~17 population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doublings remain to be completed over a time span of ~2 tlast = 2×10^7
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sec (~7 months).&quot;  7 months still sounds like quite a bit of warning,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although not as generous as 20 months.
</EM><BR>
<P>The question here becomes whether or not people take the threat seriously.
<BR>
If enough ionizing/radiation-beam weapons have been stockpiled on the basis
<BR>
of the potential threat the difference between 7 and 20 months isn't
<BR>
significant.  If the threat is not taken seriously, then 20 months
<BR>
doesn't matter much to the eventual result.  If the defensive measures
<BR>
have been prepared, deployment should take days to weeks.  In those
<BR>
situations the 7-20 months make little difference.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However even with this scenario, it is sensitive to the efficiency of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the goo.  These two scenarios are assuming dissipation of 100 MJ/kg
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the conversion.  This is justified with &quot;Drexler [4] estimates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the typical energy dissipation caused by chemical transformations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involving carbon-rich materials will be Ediss = (q Dbio) ~ 100 MJ/kg of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; final product using readily-envisioned irreversible methods in systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where low energy dissipation is not a primary design objective.&quot;  Well,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we're assuming the goo is attacking using a stealth method where low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy dissipation is an important design objective.  Hence Drexler's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; estimate is not very relevant.
</EM><BR>
<P>I argued very strongly in pre-reviews that there is a significant breakpoint
<BR>
between the energy dissipative and reversible (low energy) methods.
<BR>
To grow faster than current biomass is likely to require higher
<BR>
energy dissipation because you have to invoke transport methods
<BR>
for molecules that require a significant production of heat.
<BR>
Most bio-transport currently is by diffusion which is slow but
<BR>
generates little heat.  To reduce energy consumption significantly
<BR>
you have to pay the price of slower (reversible) operations.
<BR>
<P>I very much doubt that early nanotech can operate in the energy
<BR>
efficient regime and when it does I expect it will be slow.
<BR>
<P>I know of no evidence that suggests that you can operate in an
<BR>
energy efficient regime and be &quot;fast&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The paper also suggests that the 100 MJ/kg estimate is appropriate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because highly dissipative designs are easier to produce and, given the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficulty of the problem, these are the kinds of gray goo threats most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely to be faced during the early and intermediate years of nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even if true, the paper has not previously stated that its estimate was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only meant to apply to immature nanotech systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>The paper underwent an evolution and would require significant modifications
<BR>
to divide it between the &quot;immature&quot; and &quot;mature&quot; nanotech threats.  There
<BR>
is an assumption, perhaps not well discussed, that the defense capabilities
<BR>
are roughly comparble to the offensive capabilities.  So the questions are
<BR>
whether immature nanotech can trump itself or whether mature nanotech
<BR>
can trump itself.  These should be explored further in individual detail.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even terrestrial vegetation is quoted as being able to do better than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this figure, dissipating 38 MJ/kg.  The paper is assuming that nanotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be less capable than biology.  That is not consistent with the usual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conservative design assumptions for nanotech.  Drexler and Merkle think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that 0.1 MJ/kg is possible in theory.
</EM><BR>
<P>Initially (immature) nanotech *will* be less efficient than biology.
<BR>
Biology has had billions of years to try and make things as efficient
<BR>
as possible.  That will not happen in nanotech overnight.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; If we assume 10 MJ/kg, modestly better than the biosphere, the 7 month
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scenario shrinks by a factor of 10 to about 3 weeks, much less time for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defense.  And if we ever did reach Drexler's optimum design, things would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be over in minutes (as little as 76 seconds from single nanite to total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conversion of world biomass, according to one of the more extravagant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extrapolations in the paper).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, the *BIG* question is *IF* you can reach Drexler's optimum design.
<BR>
If you cannot point out a concrete way of acheiving that, then you
<BR>
have to stick with numbers that are &quot;reasonably&quot; achievable.
<BR>
If you look at *highly* optimized systems such as ATP production
<BR>
in the mitochondria, you will realize that &quot;optimum design&quot; is
<BR>
a very nice theoretical concept that requires concrete paths to be
<BR>
something more than a pipe dream.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another problem is that the paper's emphasis is on detection.  In several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; places it seems to assume that this is the hard part of the problem and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that actual defense is relatively easy, which is certainly counter to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the conventional wisdom:
</EM><BR>
<P>The question is *where* is the conventional wisdom?  Do you have citations?
<BR>
<P>I'll cite a nanodefense based on the energy requirements for a highly
<BR>
disruptive beam of neutrons vis-a-vis the energy costs of constructing
<BR>
a highly organized nanobot.  Disruption is cheap, construction (esp.
<BR>
at the atomic scale is expensive).  Nanobots may be able to withstand
<BR>
hurricanes but they are going to drop like flies in lightening strikes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's ironic that the standard argument for gray goo advantage, that it can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be destructive while the defenders must preserve information, is turned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on its head here.
</EM><BR>
<P>Precisely -- the only situation in which grey goo is a threat is if
<BR>
it is *replicative*.  A single bacteria in Kenya that has developed
<BR>
the ability to kill any human is *not* going to be a threat to me
<BR>
*unless* it can replicate itself and get close enough to come into
<BR>
contact with me.  A single grey goo nanobot is worthless because
<BR>
the biosphere grows faster than it can destroy.  So in order for
<BR>
the badbots to be a threat, not only must the breakdown and consume
<BR>
the good stuff, they must do so while making sure they do not suffer
<BR>
an fatal damage to their own operating systems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now it is the gray goo which is struggling to survive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and replicate, while the defenders with their numerical superiority can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lay waste if necessary in order to destroy an infestation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why is this surprising?  It is what occurs *every* day with the current
<BR>
designs of our own immune systems.  There are volumes written on
<BR>
the use of anti-oxidant supplements to defend against oxidative
<BR>
damage from hyperactive immune system cells.  Our immune systems
<BR>
wage war and &quot;collateral&quot; damage is a necessary evil.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; This is not an early or intermediate level of nanotech development.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It would be among the most sophisticated nanotech applications imaginable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By the time such a global system could be designed, developed and put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into play, gray goo could have wiped out the world ten times over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There seems to be a fundamental mismatch between the sophistication of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the goodbots, who run an active immune system that checks every cell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the planet, and the badbots, who can't manage to operate even as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efficiently as green plants.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is precisely the point -- *if* the badbots *do* operate more
<BR>
efficiently than green plants they will be detectable.  Anything converting
<BR>
biomatter into nanomatter is going to alter its spectral signature -- how
<BR>
do you do that &quot;stealthfully&quot;?  The &quot;active immune system&quot; starts with
<BR>
simple monitoring of heat radiation and molecular gas abundances
<BR>
(using *current* technology).  It grows in complexity as nanotechnology
<BR>
becomes more sophisticated.  You have to make a concrete argument that
<BR>
badbots can hide their activities from goodbots at the same level
<BR>
of technological sophistication.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In summary, Robert Freitas does a good job in the quantitative analysis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the limitations faced by gray goo.  But the conclusion that the gray
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goo problem is readily dealt with is much less convincing.  The paper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be better if it just focused on the numbers, and left the strategic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; analysis to another day.
</EM><BR>
<P>A number of people (not myself) pushed for the inclusion of more
<BR>
strategic analysis.  The inclusion may not have been the best
<BR>
result (perhaps due to a failure to address things in sufficient
<BR>
detail in a paper that was already getting long).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It also should be much more objective about the seriousness of the gray
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goo threat.  Foresight seems to have made a political decision to downplay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gray goo in the last several years, and this paper unfortunately seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be consistent with that political position.
</EM><BR>
<P>I doubt Foresight has made a decision to &quot;downplay&quot; the threat.   More likely
<BR>
internal discussions (that I have not been privy to, but can imagine)
<BR>
have made it seem clear that the defences may provide effective countermeasures
<BR>
against attackers.  I actually was fairly shocked in my first read of
<BR>
the paper that 20 months was much too fast and we are all doomed.
<BR>
But then after considering the monitoring options and possible responses
<BR>
by defender-bots, I realized that 20 months gave us a wide margin
<BR>
of safety.
<BR>
<P>There is ample precedence for this in biology as we live in a very diverse
<BR>
bio-world and have yet to see a monoculture takeover occur 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Much more work needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be done before we have a clear picture of the true scope of the gray
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goo threat.  Robert Freitas has made an important contribution, but we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are not yet in position to settle the matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>No question.  Clearly the paper says, if we relax our vigilance, we may
<BR>
encounter problems.  Less clear is the fact that if we do not prepare
<BR>
ourselves adequately from a defensive perspective, we may be overwhelmed.
<BR>
<P>Hals comments however are useful.  They engage some of the really
<BR>
difficult problems regarding *what* are good and feasible defenses
<BR>
and how rapidly will more efficient nano-ecologies develop.
