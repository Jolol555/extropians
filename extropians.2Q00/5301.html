<P>This is an important point that should not be glossed over.
<BR>
In a full-nanotech era, assuming you don't copy yourself endlessly,
<BR>
you have more resources than you &quot;need&quot; (~= to the current
<BR>
situation for anyone with a net worth in excess of $1-10 million
<BR>
at current interest rates).
<BR>
<P>I'll make the general observation that many current high net-worth
<BR>
individuals do not have to work to survive (having reached pseudo
<BR>
communistic state condition), yet most of them still get up and go to
<BR>
work every day (Paul Allen being an extreme case in point).
<BR>
<P>So, the question becomes whether the handouts generate apathy
<BR>
(implying communism is self-defeating) or whether a significant
<BR>
majority of individuals would do nothing if they could still survive
<BR>
(implying communism cannot work due to human nature).  The question
<BR>
then becomes *what* would happen to capitalistic societies if you
<BR>
released a virus that killed all individuals that demonstrated a
<BR>
high degree of risk-taking/personal-drive (i.e. the high net-worth
<BR>
individuals who work when the really don't have to)?
<BR>
<P>Extending this, will full-nanotech result in a pseudo-communistic
<BR>
condition where the desire to excel has little survival advantage
<BR>
and is bred out of the population (presumably dooming humanity
<BR>
and leaving the solar system to AI's programmed with a &quot;succeed
<BR>
or commit suicide&quot; mentality).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Still playing DA, I could say that tens of thousands of years of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communism had left your villagers at the level of a stone age
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tribe.... ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I think that is a stretch.  I suspect you could attribute most
<BR>
of Western &quot;progress&quot; to a few individuals with excessive curiosity,
<BR>
talent, or genius level mentality and not to capitalistic systems
<BR>
per se.  It is worth noting that many of said individuals had
<BR>
state support in the form of the aristocracy or favor of royalty.
<BR>
One can note that communistic systems have been very effective at
<BR>
educating masses of people (do you *really* want to discuss the
<BR>
fraction of people *reading* on the Moscow metro trains vs. the
<BR>
NY metro trains???) and creating systems that can support a large
<BR>
base of engineers whose abilities seem to speak for themselves.
