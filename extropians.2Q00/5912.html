<EM>&gt; Following the recent Mars threads, and the parallel though unrelated outburst
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of heaton the &gt;H list, I feel I have to speak up about the public relations 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gap futurists, and especially &gt;H and Extropians are facing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Why live in a gravity well when you can disassemble the planets and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribute their mass...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Claims like these, even if made in jest, will turn what could be a very strong 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public relations asset to a serious disadvantage - instead of &quot;tour Mars: see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the majestic cliffs of Olympus Mons&quot; the slogan would be &quot;don't return to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1900s - save space from the industrialists&quot; or &quot;Don't repeat the mistakes of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Earth - Don't mine Mars!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think these comments are necessarily being made in jest.
<BR>
Some people do believe that planets are an inefficient use of mass.
<BR>
Most of the mass is on the interior and doesn't do anyone any good, aside
<BR>
from providing some gravity.  And if you need that, you can probably
<BR>
get it more efficiently by centrifugal force or stellar gravity.
<BR>
<P>It may be that these ideas are difficult for people to accept and do
<BR>
bring to mind the environmental catastrophes in the past.  But I don't
<BR>
think we should necessarily tone down our views as a result.
<BR>
<P>Nobody is going to be taking Mercury apart in the next decade.  But 50
<BR>
or 100 years from now, it may be possible and desirable.  At that point,
<BR>
society's social views will probably have changed at least as much as our
<BR>
own views have changed from those 50 or 100 years ago.  There is no way
<BR>
to predict whether future society will be radical environmentalists or
<BR>
&quot;pave the universe&quot; developers by our own standards.  I don't think we
<BR>
have to be that careful to couch our views in a manner which is acceptable
<BR>
to this month's mores.
