<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;A cultist is one who...home schools for their children;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; who...has strong belief in the Second Amendment;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; ...Any of these may qualify a person as a cultist but...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Janet Reno, Attny.  General of the United States
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; during an Interview on CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on June 26,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1999.
</EM><BR>
<P>So what was the final verdict?  This is a fake quote, right?
<BR>
It would hafta be.  I cant imagine any politician stupid enough
<BR>
to qualify a person for government interference for a strong
<BR>
belief in the second amendment, not even JR.
<BR>
<P>All this brings me to the following prediction:  In the days immediately
<BR>
prior to the November election, and every major election
<BR>
thereafter, there will be a huge scandal reported and widely
<BR>
distributed on the internet involving both candidates.  After
<BR>
the elections are over, the original stories will be thoroughly
<BR>
debunked, having already served their purpose.
<BR>
<P>The internet is the perfect vehicle for such, since we have
<BR>
demonstrated that there are no repercussions for false
<BR>
accusations and few mechanisms for insuring the true
<BR>
story is finally told.  spike
