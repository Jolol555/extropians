<EM>&gt; &gt; One problem here is that it is hard to determine who to target as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perpetrator of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; these kinds of erosions of freedom.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; For example, in this red-light camera situation, it is obvious that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lockheed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Martin, privately making money off some kind of law enforcement, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhat to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; blame for advancing this violation not only of privacy but of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Consitution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which states quite bluntly that citizens are innocent by default.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How, exactly, is putting up a camera at an intersection a violation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Constitutional rights? The presumption of innocence does not imply that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; State can't watch you to see if you do something illegal - if it did, police
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would not be able to patrol the streets giving out traffic tickets. So long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as the normal standards of evidence are observed in court (i.e. they have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; show that it was you, not just someone with your license plate number), no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rights have been violated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Likewise, there is no general right to privacy in public places. In practice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such a 'right' would be both nonsensical and coercive, since it would amount
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a demand that no one be able to look at you when you walk down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; street.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I'm afraid that if we want to turn this into a rights issue, we'll have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to campaign for a Constitutional amendment forbidding government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Anyways, I say this before, it seems quite obvious, any automated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; law-enforcement like a red-light runner camera is a violation of every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; who passes through that intersection's right to presupposed innocence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Constitution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In theory there is no legal difference between automated and non-automated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law enforcement. If a cop can sit at an intersection and watch for traffic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violations (a perfectly reasonable activity), he can put up a camera to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it for him. In practice the automated systems are actually held to a higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standard than human police - if a traffic cop says he saw you break the law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the courts will usually take his word for it, but an automated system has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collect enough evidence to convince the court that there is no reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possibility of error (usually your picture, a picture of your license plate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and an instrument reading showing your violation, all time stamped and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recorded by a tamper-resistant system).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Mr. Brown, you state that you think that it is not easy to require the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government to not monitor its citizens.  Well, its bad enough now and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; why we need proactive measures and law to protect the citizenry's explicit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to presupposed innocence.  It's in some ways as simple as suing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to prevent them from doing so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately, as I pointed out above, you don't have any grounds to sue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them. You might be able to trump up some strained interpretation of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implied right to privacy, or something equally iffy, but that's about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IMO such lawsuits are inherently harmful no matter what the cause is - if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you think we should have a right that isn't clearly recognized by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Constitution, the proper course of action is to work to get an amendment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; passed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, personally, I don't worry too much about this kind of observation. Even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if we end up with cameras everywhere, the results are not especially bad.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The danger is that they will want to expand the system to cover private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property and/or internet activity. However, I think that it not too hard to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; draw a distinction between public and private spaces, and to forbid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government surveillance of the latter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mind you, we will still have to come to terms with the fact that in 10 years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone is going to be able to inconspicuously record everything that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happens in their presence, whether you want them to or not.

<P>Yet it is too simple to assign blame to them when Anthony Williams has succumbed
<BR>
<P>to the the idea there were ever any red-light runners in the district.  There
<BR>
simply weren't that many, ever.  Sure, it used to have the highest murder rate
<BR>
in the country (because of drug prohibition), but people are generally pretty
<BR>
good about red lights.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps Williams thought that this setup would be as good for the city as its
<BR>
parking meters, which is one of the largest sources of income for the district,
<BR>
which means there are very many meter-readers.  Perhaps moreso L-M payola.
<BR>
<P>Overridingly, this is some kind of pilot program to gauge how far the public can
<BR>
<P>be shafted by those who would shaft.  I say to make it quite obvious that those
<BR>
would-be shafters should go about shafting themselves and leave the rest of us
<BR>
alone.
<BR>
<P>***Also, the fact that this is privatized and thus provides a financial
<BR>
incentive
<BR>
to the contractor for each ticket issued is an extremely bad precedent as the
<BR>
profit could be seen as a reason to further overstep the contractor's bounds.
<BR>
So, it is absolutely certain that the contractor or other private provider
<BR>
should be required not to be paid more for each infraction reigstered, that is
<BR>
to say, the profit incentive to violate any driver's Consitutional rights should
<BR>
<P>be removed.  That is completely simple, the city must arrange to pay one fee for
<BR>
<P>operation and all transactions, until such time as it is proven unconstitutional
<BR>
<P>and the whole thing scrapped.
<BR>
<P>Well, along these lines, drug prohibition is bad for our country on the whole,
<BR>
and should be abolished.  Relegalization and clemency for non-violent drug users
<BR>
<P>would be a step in the right direction.
<BR>
<P>Who's violating your rights today?  It's hard to tell exactly who, and also it's
<BR>
<P>not so obvious to each of us that each of the rest of us has also had their
<BR>
rights violated.  So, along those lines, everyone who feels that Constitutional
<BR>
rights are good things should be against this privatized program and find ways
<BR>
to unite generally for freedom.
<BR>
<P>It's pretty bad that we have one elected official and his appointed thug &quot;doing
<BR>
a hold-up of the law.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Just because a law is on the books, it doesn't mean that is a) right, b) moral,
<BR>
c) ethical, and/or d) Constitutional (ethical, mostly right).  Many are.  Let's
<BR>
take a good look at the books.
<BR>
<P>Ross F.
<BR>
<P>You have a good point in whether if a mechanism to detect a lawbreak is remote
<BR>
and mechanical or human might be moot.  Here is one reply I have about it:
<BR>
consider this red-light system.  If the camera _only_ captures pictures of those
<BR>
that actually run red lights, then it is more a valid mechanism, although I
<BR>
still do not see it as one.  However, any time where no crime has been committed
<BR>
where government resources are used to remotely record innocent citizens for the
<BR>
express or real purpose of identifying things the government does not like, then
<BR>
that is wrong.
<BR>
<P>I have a problem with the attitude that &quot;it's inevitable, accept it.&quot;  I guess
<BR>
first, nothing's inevitable, and second, if it's wrong it should not be
<BR>
accepted.  Of course, people have different definitions of right and wrong.
<BR>
<P>So I see a difference between a cop on his beat and an institutionalized system
<BR>
of citzenry monitoring.  I do think there are plenty of good policemen, in fact
<BR>
there are enough good policemen and we don't need any more policemen.
<BR>
<P>It is as this:  people use the roads.  People use the roads to commute from
<BR>
place to place.  Criminals (and in this case, red-light scofflaws) use the roads
<BR>
to commute from place to place.  People use phones and the Internet.  People use
<BR>
electronic methods of communications to communicate from place to
<BR>
place.Criminals (and in this case, red-light scofflaws) use electronic methods
<BR>
to communicate from place to place.  Should government be allowed to inspect all
<BR>
electronic communcations?  NO.
