<BR>
What's Hot
<BR>
----------
<BR>
DUAL MODE OF ACTION PROVIDES NOVEL APPROACH TO TREATING ALZHEINMER'S
<BR>
People trying a new treatment for  Alzheimer's Disease experienced
<BR>
significant cognitive, functional and behavioral improvement during a five
<BR>
month study. Like other Alzheimer's drugs on the market, galantamine (or
<BR>
Reminyl®), maintains acetylcholine levels by blocking the enzyme
<BR>
acetylcholinesterase from breaking down acetylcholine.
<BR>
Low levels of acetylcholine contribute to the disease's symptoms. What
<BR>
makes this drug different is that laboratory studies show galantamine also
<BR>
indirectly acts on nicotinic receptors to release more acetylcholine.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>ONE GENE MAY HOLD LINK TO AGING DISEASES
<BR>
Discovering a common genetic link to a variety of age-related diseases,
<BR>
researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) say their
<BR>
findings suggest the possibility exists that someday drugs targeted at the
<BR>
p21 gene could prevent or treat cancer, atherosclerosis, arthritis and
<BR>
Alzheimer's disease.
<BR>
The p21 gene stops cells from dividing when they become old and halts cell
<BR>
growth allowing for repair if the cell is damaged by toxins or radiation.

<BR>
<P>STIMULATING STROKE PATIENTS' BRAIN MAY AID REHAB
<BR>
Stroke and brain injury creates faulty connections in the cerebral cortex
<BR>
which causes patients to experience difficulty coordinating movements or
<BR>
performing tasks. Patients typically regain only limited function, causing
<BR>
experts to think that the brain is hard wired early in life and remains
<BR>
unchanged in adulthood. But now scientists believe that connections in the
<BR>
cortex, which controls voluntary movement, speech and reasoning, are
<BR>
continuously modified by experience and learning.

Disease Therapy Protocols
<BR>
-------------------------
<BR>
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE by Ben Best
<BR>
Alzheimer's disease is incurable. It leads to death within an average of 8
<BR>
years after diagnosis, the last 3 of which are typically spent in an
<BR>
institution. Besides memory loss, Alzheimer's patients show dramatic
<BR>
personality changes, disorientation, declining physical coordination, and
<BR>
an inability to care for themselves. In the final stages, victims are
<BR>
bedridden, lose urinary and bowel control, and suffer epileptic attacks.
<BR>
Death is usually due to pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
<BR>
Treatment of cultured neurons with vitamin E has been shown to protect
<BR>
them from beta-amyloid toxicity. This suggests that vitamin E and other
<BR>
antioxidants such as vitamin C (which regenerates vitamin E) and coenzyme
<BR>
Q10 may be of value in preventing Alzheimer's disease. In fact, melatonin
<BR>
has been shown to protect cell cultures from beta-amyloid toxicity.
<BR>
N-acetylcysteine has protected cultured cells from oxidative stress due to
<BR>
AGE-modified tau-protein.

<BR>
<P>STROKE (HEMORRHAGIC)
<BR>
A stroke is defined as the sudden reduction of blood flow to a portion of
<BR>
the brain. There are two main types of strokes: ischemic (also known as
<BR>
thrombotic) and hemorrhagic. A hemorrhagic stroke is an extreme medical
<BR>
emergency, and prompt treatment is imperative. Although hemorrhagic
<BR>
strokes account for only 15% of all strokes, they have a much higher
<BR>
mortality rate.
<BR>
Hydergine, an antioxidant medication that helps to protect brain cells,
<BR>
may be beneficial for the treatment of hemorrhagic shock. In Europe,
<BR>
Hydergine is administered on an acute-care basis for the prevention of
<BR>
brain damage following stroke. The recommended dosage of Hydergine in an
<BR>
acute situation is 10 mg administered sublingually (under the tongue) and
<BR>
10 mg given orally.
<BR>
Because the FDA has not approved Hydergine for use in the treatment of
<BR>
stroke, emergency room physicians may not be willing to administer this
<BR>
medication. Patients or their surrogates can, however, request that this
<BR>
medication be used. Hydergine has been approved in the treatment of other
<BR>
diseases, so it is available through the hospital pharmacy.
<BR>
Caution: Liquid Hydergine is contraindicated because of its high alcohol
<BR>
content.

Product of the Week
<BR>

<BR>
COGNITEX
<BR>
Cognitex was introduced by the Life Extension Foundation in 1982 as the
<BR>
first nutrient formula to boost short term memory and prevent some of the
<BR>
effects of aging in the brain. Since then, it has been improved regularly,
<BR>
with the addition of phosphatidylserine (PS) to provide additional
<BR>
protection for brain neurological structure and function.  CDP Choline has
<BR>
been added to fill a missing link in the conversion of choline to
<BR>
phosphatidylcholine in brain cell membranes, and to increase cerebral
<BR>
oxygenation.
<BR>
The newest addition to the formula is vinpocetine, a periwinkle extract
<BR>
that enhances circulation and oxygen utilization in the brain, increases
<BR>
tolerance of the brain toward diminished blood flow, and inhibits abnormal
<BR>
platelet aggregation. It also maintains brain cell electrical conductivity
<BR>
and protects against damage caused by excessive intracellular release of
<BR>
calcium.
