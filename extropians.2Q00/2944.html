<P>
Long time Extropians Sean Morgan, Ken Kittlitz and I recently formed a
<BR>
company, Javien Inc., to develop an enhanced online community system that is
<BR>
intended to eventually replace the majordomo mailing list and associated web
<BR>
archives. The system will include a subscriber database where anyone can
<BR>
attach information that they choose to their online identity with
<BR>
configurable access control.
<BR>
<P>We were working closely with Sasha to ensure that the new system will be
<BR>
able to support his automated collaborative filtering ideas. Last month we
<BR>
travelled to Boston where Sasha facilitated an introduction to 100xVentures.
<BR>
We had some great conversations about the future of the internet and
<BR>
before we left Sasha agreed in principle to become an equity partner in
<BR>
Javien and our consulting chief scientist. The formation of Javien was
<BR>
largely inspired by Sasha's ideas and we are still committed to making them
<BR>
a reality. We currently have four full time employees. The seed financing
<BR>
is in place to carry us for the next six months and we are in the process
<BR>
of raising more capital.
<BR>
<P>These products will be open source. If anyone is interested in contributing
<BR>
to the development of these ideas and/or joining our venture, join the
<BR>
discussion by sending &quot;subscribe connexus&quot; in the body of a message to
<BR>

<BR>
<P>In addition we are attending the Foresight Sr. Assoc. Gathering next
<BR>
week in Palo Alto and we have set aside the day after the conference, Monday
<BR>
the 22nd, to meet anyone interested in collaborating. Mail me if you are
<BR>
interested in attending.

<P><EM>&gt;         Here are some of my thoughts about what such a system would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;start out being.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         There would be a &quot;membership&quot; link off of the main
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.extropy.org/">http://www.extropy.org/</A> page.  People could go to this page and after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;logging in, check their membership status and update their personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information.  This would include information like interrests, areas of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expertise, extropian activities completed....  Everyone could specify
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the level of privacy for all data fields in their own DB file with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;following proposed values:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;[...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There would be a search page that would enable people like Sasha to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;find other extropians based on interrests, location, time....
</EM><BR>
<P>Brent: I'm very much in favor of this idea. If ExI had had the money, we
<BR>
would have hired someone to do something like this quite a while ago. It
<BR>
could be a great addition to the value of the website and help build the
<BR>
extropian community.
<BR>
<P>If we can gather the programming skills necessary and get commitments to
<BR>
get the job done (and be sure that someone will maintain it), I would be
<BR>
delighted. A members' interests/contacts page would not only be useful, it
<BR>
would be -- as you note -- a tribute to Sasha by following up on one of his
<BR>
ideas.
