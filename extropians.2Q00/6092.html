<P>This must be a trend.  I could not convince some teachers that the 
<BR>
moon kept the same face toward the earth, but did not keep the same 
<BR>
face toward the sun.  They claimed that it never rotated, kept the 
<BR>
same face toward the earth and the sun, and that the light side was 
<BR>
always light and the dark side was always dark.
