<EM>&gt; &gt; Consider this hypothetical situation: group A and group B have a dispute.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; After the fact, group A is dead, while at some point when they more alive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; group B was armed with armored tanks and automatic weapons and was in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the state of assaulting group A.  The consistency of group A was a set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of civilians and group B military.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Later some people who are still alive decide to have a simulation and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; see what they can determine about the facts as they occurred.  Group B
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; runs all aspects of the simulation without oversight, where group B's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; goal is to show certain things.  What conclusions do you expect to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; apparent from group B's simulation?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Don't forget, the plaintiffs (Waco survivors and heirs) have lawyers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as well.  The test was originally proposed by the plaintiffs and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;terms were agreed to by them.  I believe they also agreed upon the firm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to conduct the analysis (unfortunately I suspect the only organizations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with experience in this kind of analysis have military or law enforcement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ties because those groups are the main users of this technology).
</EM><BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Since VDS has a conflict of interest by being employed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the defense, and since most or all IR-based companies have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same conflict, a team composed of people selected by the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plaintiffs and the defense should have been assembled to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;review the tapes so that plaintiff experts could have had
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an oversight role during the actual analysis of the tapes.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turned out, even if the plaintiffs agreed to the terms,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tapes were analyzed only by a party employed by the defense.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what attributes of what flashes were used to compare flashes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the 1993 and 2000 tapes was left to the defense's employee.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's curious to note that ALL of the three FLIR experts for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the plaintiffs died or almost died within a month of the FLIR
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;test. A few days after the FLIR test, Dr Zegel collapsed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unconscious and barely survived after 10 days in the hospital.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diagnosis was blood poisoning. A few days before the FLIR
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;test Dr Allard almost died of a massive heart attack. Another
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expert to testify for plaintiffs would be FLIR expert Carlos
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghigliotti, who was found dead several weeks after the FLIR
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;test, and had been dead for a few weeks. Attorney David Hardy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had, however, spoken to him shortly after the FLIR test, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is what Ghigliotti told Hardy about the FLIR test:
<BR>
<P>&quot;I talked to him [Ghigliotti] after the re-creation, and his assessment
<BR>
was that it was pure junk -- the aircraft wasn't even at the right
<BR>
altitude, they didn't have the right procedures to verify that the sensor
<BR>
was functioning comparable to the one of 4/19, etc. He predicted (correctly,
<BR>
as I learned this week) that a British camera would be set to record on the
<BR>
European PAL format, rather than the American NTSC format, and this would
<BR>
create a major complication, since they use different frame rates and
<BR>
frame sizes. The best thing that could be done with any resulting tape
<BR>
(and this is BEFORE the results were known) was to drop it in the
<BR>
wastecan. The Independent Counsel had blown it.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I remember talking to him outside his office, after the first visit,
<BR>
standing there in the parking lot after dark. He'd mentioned that the
<BR>
guy with Infraspection Institute, who had analysed the FLIR for 60
<BR>
Minutes back in '95 or '96, and found FBI gunshots and shooters on it,
<BR>
had been terrified. In fact, he'd sent copies of the tape to Carlos and
<BR>
to several others in the IR field, with notes saying &quot;If anything happens
<BR>
to me, you'll know why.&quot; I asked Carlos if he'd ever been fearful. He
<BR>
said only for a while, between the time he made his findings and the
<BR>
time he reported them to the Committee. But once he told others of
<BR>
his results, he figured the cat was out of the bag.&quot;
<BR>

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a summary of Ghigliotti's preliminary report that he
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent to the Congressional Committee on Waco a few days before
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he got dead: <A HREF="http://www.newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000/4/30/160306">http://www.newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000/4/30/160306</A>
