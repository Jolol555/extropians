<P><EM>&gt; John Grigg quotes Nature, as forwarded by Robin:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;There is no such thing as bad publicity, it is sometimes said. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ever since Eric Drexler brought the term 'nanotechnology' into vogue in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; his 1986 book Engines of Creation, some researchers have felt that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; field has been burdened by unwanted baggage.
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting claim, without much explanation as to &quot;why&quot; that is the case.
<BR>
I read Engines, then I read much of Nanosystems and Nanomedicine.
<BR>
The writing is on the wall for those who want to read it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; These ideas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; were quickly seized on by transhumanists - people who imagine what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; world will look like after technology has rendered us extinct.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, only the grey goo problem would potentially render us
<BR>
extinct (and Robert F's recent paper casts some questions on those
<BR>
scenarios) [see below].  I think most &quot;transhumanists&quot; would value the
<BR>
diversity of a world (solar system?) that includes humans and trans-humans.
<BR>
I don't see any of us recomending &quot;Transhuman or die&quot; as a motto
<BR>
for our license plates (though there may be a few among us
<BR>
who are closet thinkers along those lines...) :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No, the article didn't say anything more about Drexler.  In fact my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perception is that the whole field is doing its best to pretend that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he doesn't exist.
</EM><BR>
The &quot;whole field&quot;, such as it is, consists of a couple of University
<BR>
centers, where I suspect there is a fair amount of respect for Eric's
<BR>
work.  The &quot;newly born&quot; nanotech researchers stepping up to the funding
<BR>
trough, probably haven't even read EoC.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I predict that the Foresight conference will soon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no longer be the premier nanotech conference.  The real academics will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to disassociate themself from the nanofanatics and set up a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respectable venue.  (Maybe this has happened already; I don't follow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the research.)
</EM><BR>
<P>The FI fall conference is moving to the East Coast this year, presumably
<BR>
to make it easier to pull in the East coast conservatives.  Academic
<BR>
conferences in general tend to move around to educate more people.
<BR>
As it moves, the FI influence may become less, but I don't see any
<BR>
other organization as likely to come along and &quot;bridge&quot; the various
<BR>
disciplines that MNT requires.
<BR>
<P>Some of the commercial education organizations have started nanotech
<BR>
conferences, but they are more expensive than the FI conference and
<BR>
are still much smaller.  NIH is having an NT conference this summer
<BR>
but it is more buzzword labeling than hardcore NT.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can't help thinking that a core problem is cryonics.  Cryonicists have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been hoping that nanotech will give them respectability for 15 years now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact, the opposite seems to have happened.  Cryonics is so disreputable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for most people, so firmly entrenched in the nonsense/fraud category,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the least association with the practice is enough to discredit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any activity.  Drexler wrote about repairing the damage from cryonic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspension in Engines, and thereby permanently branded his form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotech as nonsense, for many observers.
</EM><BR>
<P>You may be right to some degree.  But the same underlying problem exists
<BR>
for both Cryonics and Replicators -- you have to connect all of the dots
<BR>
between the inputs and the outputs.  I would say that people have as
<BR>
much trouble with Replicators as Cryonics because they &quot;break&quot; tradiational
<BR>
economics.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If Drexlerian nanotech comes about, in the full flower of its predicted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power, then there is a decent chance that cryonic suspension will work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And that means that everyone who has allowed a loved one to die has,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in effect, murdered that person.  This would be an intolerable moral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; burden for most people, making it hard for them to think clearly about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where this technology may lead.
</EM><BR>
<P>Or, if Replicators work, then the &quot;slow &amp; steady/save for tomorrow&quot;
<BR>
approaches are all wrong.  You want an all-the-stops-pulled-out
<BR>
sprint to the finish line.
<BR>
<P>Fundamentally, robust nanotech &quot;breaks&quot; many, many &quot;cherished&quot; beliefs
<BR>
and for most people their beliefs are what is really important.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Science (Nature?!?) article really didn't change this view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They seemed to be drawing a distinction between the blue-sky dreams
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Drexler and the practical, concrete research going on today in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labs studying buckytubes and crystals (much of which is not really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that closely related to nanotech as we know it).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, a lot of relabeling going on.  But the parallel-tip nanoscale
<BR>
writing AFM's are going to put another nail in the coffin of the
<BR>
naysayers.  The balance will tip and when it does, you don't want
<BR>
to be in front of the crowd rushing into the &quot;pro&quot;-nanotech pan,
<BR>
saying, &quot;See, I always said Drexler was right...&quot;.
<BR>
<P>It would be nice to get some of the people who are &quot;naysayers&quot;
<BR>
on record, so you can feed them their words in a few yeaers.
<BR>
<P>It is interesting to note that among the &quot;technical people&quot;,
<BR>
computer programmers and/or systems engineers seem to be those
<BR>
who can &quot;see&quot; the Drexlerian vision.  Scientists who are simply
<BR>
devoted to taking things apart (e.g. most health researchers) or
<BR>
engineers who have a micro-focus (e.g. one rivet in an airplane)
<BR>
can't see the big picture.
<BR>
<P>Robert
<BR>
<P>[Note: re: the grey goo/ecophagy problem -- I don't want to reopen
<BR>
that discussion, because, as Neil Jacobstein pointed out at the
<BR>
FISA conference, the problem is its too easy to get out-of-sync with
<BR>
regard to offensive/defensive technological levels.  Robert F. has
<BR>
laid a good foundation, the next level of the discussion would
<BR>
require a few dozen people versed in weapons tech and nanotech
<BR>
to sit down and do careful scenario planning and strategy analysis.]
