I had discusssed the problem of whether it will be feasible to know
<BR>
the difference between A(recreated)-humans vs. and the decorporealized
<BR>
originals.

<EM>&gt; Melzack's Neuromatrix theory of self seems to adequately explain this point.

I didn't understand the reference, so I went looking:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; { Melzack's neuromatrix theory of phantom limb[1] claims that body experience
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is genetic; he says, for example, that 'the neural network that underlies the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience of one's physical self is genetically determined'. This assertion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is based upon two studies carried out 30 years ago[2-4 ]which claim 'that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; substantial number of children who are born without all or part of a limb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel a valid phantom of the missing part'. Close scrutiny reveals that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these studies have methodological shortcomings. }

<BR>
<P>I must admit I still don't really see the connection.  Perhaps there is
<BR>
something I'm missing about the neuromatrix theory.
<BR>
<P>If you are suggesting that an A-human cannot effectively be the original,
<BR>
because there is no underlying genetic material, then I'd suggest you are
<BR>
treading on thin ice.  The neural matrix (hardware) is so similar among most
<BR>
humans that we should understand the basic wiring and the effects of specific
<BR>
polymorphisms enough to be able to simulate much of it quite accurately
<BR>
within 15-20 years.  I'll take the Turing approach here that if looks
<BR>
like a duck, walks like a duck and talks like a duck then from my perceptual
<BR>
standpoint, it *is* a duck.
<BR>
<P>In Sasha's case there would seem to be a fighting chance that there is enough
<BR>
original material around to provide a plausibly realistic simulation.
<BR>
This may be aided by the fact that the individuals are still available
<BR>
from which much of his personal genetic makeup could be determined.
<BR>
<P>In contrast millions of individuals die each year leaving behind
<BR>
nothing more than fading memories in the people they knew.
<BR>
I feel sad for their loss.
<BR>
<P>The cloning debates now will pale in comparison to the geno-reconstruction
<BR>
debates of the future.  [I'm not assuming that geno-reconstruction will
<BR>
be able to reproduce the mind of an individual, but that geno-reconstruction
<BR>
will allow a computer to produce a more accurate simulation if sufficient
<BR>
material regarding the person's life, opinions, thoughts, etc. is available.]
<BR>
<P>So, for those individuals who can't quite convince their parents or loved
<BR>
ones that lifespan extension, cryonics, etc is &quot;real&quot;, you can do an &quot;end-run&quot;
<BR>
around their lack of foresight.  Sit down with them with a video camera
<BR>
and get them to tell lots of stories about their life.  &quot;Interview&quot; them
<BR>
for their not-yet-born family so they will be able to &quot;know&quot; who Great-Grandma
<BR>
or Great-Grandpa was.  Get your cells and those of more enlightened family
<BR>
members frozen someplace (there are several organizations I believe that now
<BR>
do this).  If you can, request or even covertly harvest some of their cells
<BR>
(e.g. offer to vacuum the house then get the contents of the bag frozen),
<BR>
or clean off the individual's hairbrush....  Not guaranteed, but better
<BR>
than nothing.  Best would be to get them to arrange to have a vial of blood
<BR>
shipped to a cold-storage facility the next time they get a physical checkup
<BR>
and blood is being taken for routine lab workups.
<BR>
<P>It is worth thinking about this as a &quot;group&quot; activity at Extro5.
<BR>
Certainly a news-worthy and thought provoking activity to have hundreds
<BR>
of individuals interacting with each other with a goal of providing
<BR>
enough &quot;bits&quot; (that can be stored in multiple places) that they can
<BR>
plausibly be recreated or even recorporealized from such information,
<BR>
should an unforeseen or unavoidable accident occur.
<BR>
<P>I can see the list in 30 years -- &quot;Ok, will everybody please look
<BR>
at the Burch v.14 recreation and see if his desire for fast
<BR>
cars is tuned correctly?&quot;
<BR>
