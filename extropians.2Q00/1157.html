<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;The only protection offered against illegitimate use of deadly force in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;the U.S. is to kill the state agents/police at the time the incident
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;occurs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Murder is *already* a capital offense, even if you are wearing a cop uniform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at the time you commit the murder.  So I assume what you are suggesting is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some sort of summary execution which bypasses the jury trial process, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   That sounds like a really great plan.  Oh, except for the minor detail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that *no one in their right mind would become a cop*. I'm amazed that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can hire people as cops now to get paid marginally well to risk their lives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; every working hour of the day.  And now, in addition to getting reprimanded,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suspended, fired and sued for making an error, you think they should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *killed* too?  Yeah, sure I might take that job...if it paid $10 million a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; year.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it would make sure that cops make sure that their actions are legal
<BR>
before they take them. When you are dealing with life or death issues,
<BR>
why does the life of an innocent law abiding civilian mean less than
<BR>
someone who has been condemned to death by a jury? You seem to think
<BR>
that so long as the cops are doing their jobs and following orders, they
<BR>
can kill whoever they want with impunity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is legal *now*, and always has been; I wasn't making a suggestion.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is considered self-defense if you kill a cop executing illegal force,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether the use of illegal force is accidental or intentional.  The moment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone threatens lethal force against you without correct legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; authority, they become fair game in the eyes of the law whether or not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they come under the color of authority.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please note the importance of making sure the police are bearing correct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legal authority; if they are, one cannot legitimately resist them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, if they kick in the door of the wrong address, a violent response
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is justified even if they have a warrant for that address as the warrant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is effectively invalidated by being incorrect.  The courts have ruled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; repeatedly that killing police while they are threatening lethal force on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an illegal or invalid pretext is to be considered justifiable homicide.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are rules about where the lines are drawn, but the priniciple stands
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on its own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
The problem with such situations though is getting out of it alive. Once
<BR>
you've killed a cop, most other cops look at you as an open season
<BR>
target. They dont' want you to be alive to be able to question the
<BR>
legality of the warrant or their actions, especially those cops who
<BR>
operate in 'unconventional' units, like vice, gang violence, organized
<BR>
crime, or other units.
