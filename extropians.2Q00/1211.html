<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Short of this, you are just opening yourself up to being sued (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; criminally charged) for assault, battery and false imprisonment.  All in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I say you're better off just calling 911.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;These are standards no different than what cops face every day. If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;witness the crime, you are considered responsible to affect an arrest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well I can't speak for your part of the world, but in California the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standards for cops are less stringent.  So long as they can show probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cause, they are immune from suit regardless of whether or not the person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they arrested actually committed the crime, and regardless of whether or not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a crime has in fact been committed.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is pretty common, and what I actually meant. Its not supposed to be this
<BR>
way, according to the US code and most state law. The police departments have
<BR>
gotten themselves near liability free status and as a result are typically less
<BR>
qualified to use lethal force than an armed civilian, only because the state
<BR>
sets the bar high for civlians in terms of required training, etc. Armed
<BR>
citizens like to practice their skills. Most cops see practicing their shooting
<BR>
skills as a chore they would prefer to avoid.
<BR>
<P>Its not an accident that most all casualties on the side of the government at
<BR>
Waco were due to freindly fire... most of those people didn't know how to handle
<BR>
firearms, and/or had little to no tactical training.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, in California there is no responsibility to effect a citizens arrest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whenever you witness a crime.  In fact you have no obligation whatsoever to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even call the police.  So long as your conduct does not rise to the level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; the crime, you can sit back and enjoy the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entertainment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do recall a Seinfeld episode where Jerry &amp; the gang were arrested for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; failing to come to the aid of a crime victim when they traveled to (I think)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Massachusetts.  So there may be places in the world where the average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizen does have the obligation to stop crimes in progress.  California,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thankfully, is not one of them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its part of the Good Samaritan laws, as well as part of the Posse Comitatus Act
<BR>
at the federal level. Refusing to give aid  is what is called 'depraved
<BR>
indifference', which can be used against a parent who refuses to report the
<BR>
child abuse of the other spouse, refuses to give thier children health care, or
<BR>
watching idly by while another person suffers injury, harm or foul play.
<BR>
<P>The fact that states like New York and California do not have this standard of
<BR>
conduct in their legal system is another indication of why such states are
<BR>
hellholes that should not be emulated elsewhere, and should be avoided by
<BR>
tourists visiting our country.
<BR>
<P>The fact that you find the suffering of other innocent human beings to be
<BR>
'entertainment' is rather indicative that you'd prefer to live in an empirical
<BR>
socity of bread and circuses than a free society of respect and civic
<BR>
responsibility.
