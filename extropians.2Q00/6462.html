<EM>&gt; I haven't been getting enough other things done, and I've sworn off posting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to lists for a while, but I'm beside myself with rage after reading the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Green Party Platform.  This is the worst bunch of crap I've ever seen as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; party platform in this country.  At least the old socialist types didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to totally destroy industry. What's especially disturbing is that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparently have talented advertising people working for them.  They're using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the right buzzwords and have the thing laid out in such a way that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cursory reading would make it look at lot less scary than it actually is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Remember when I was lamenting about how people just see a couple of words
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and draw a conclusion without reading the whole document?  That's what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gonna happen here, I'm afraid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thank you, zeb, for bringing this to our attention.  I shall urge everyone I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know who might be taken in by this shit to read the whole thing and think it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through before supporting it.

<P>Ah, but we want anyone who would have otherwise voted for Gore to give a very
<BR>
serious consideration to the Green Party Platform. Really. Its principled stands
<BR>
on the issues are where Gore would be if he actually had the guts, and a real
<BR>
backbone instead of whatever he has up his butt, and how he would really feel
<BR>
about the issues if he actually had feelings instead of canned mediagenic
<BR>
programming...
