<P>Doesn't matter about the bullet - if it's metallic, in a metal chamber, 
<BR>
it's just like a dead short at the end of the waveguide. I guess we need to 
<BR>
get laws requiring RF transparent plastic bullets.

<P>The target ammo I have been using lately is marked &quot;lead free&quot;. Bismuth 
<BR>
alloy? Got to ask the range guys what they are using. Of course, we can 
<BR>
always go to gold or tungsten - supposedly the US Defense Department has 
<BR>
already decided that all our guns in the future will shoot good capitalist 
<BR>
mainland Chinese tungsten bullets..
<BR>
<P>There's an environmental lawsuit going on here near Chicago  - a South 
<BR>
Suburban skeet range was shooting over a drainage ditch that sometimes had 
<BR>
water in it. The antis got a suit claiming that it's a feeder to a river, 
<BR>
therefore under EPA control. I understand there's an EPA order issued 
<BR>
preventing use of the range until the facts are ascertained.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Expect shoot to kill orders by police against anyone using a mechanical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gun...after all, why would you be using, or why would you need a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mechanical gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if you didn't intend to commit a crime with it? Thats logical... ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>How are the poleece going to tell a mechanical gun from a modified &quot;smart&quot; 
<BR>
weapon until after they try to HERF it and it still shoots at 'em? Unless 
<BR>
they adopt a policy of shoot to kill anyone suspected to be carrying a gun. 
<BR>
That might just get some of the sheeple's attention, if it comes to that...
