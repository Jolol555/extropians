<P>
I agree with Charlie's somewhat pessimistic assessment of keeping
<BR>
isolated brains alive - it is quite hard. Some successful experiments
<BR>
have been done based on attaching the severed head to the circulatory
<BR>
system of the body through tubes, but that is really cheating and
<BR>
obviously not a long-term solution.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The nutrient requirements of a whole body are not exactly simple. I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; once involved in the preparation of TPN (total parenteral nutrition)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bags for patients who were too ill to digest food; TPN is a rich,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creamy emulsion that can be perfused through a vein and contains about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the minimum necessary to keep you alive -- vitamins, ions, glucose,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trilgycerides, and a load of other stuff. It tends to be unstable --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use within six hours -- and has to be prepared in a clean room with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aseptic technique (you really _don't_ want to inject bacteria into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone on TPN!).
</EM><BR>
<P>Still, it has become good enough to keep people alive for decades by
<BR>
now. A brain might be somewhat simpler, since its nutritional
<BR>
requirements are a bit simpler than the rest of the body, but TPN is
<BR>
still hard.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liver problem is more serious; keep recirculating blood through your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disembodied brain and it'll poison itself with its own waste metabolites
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unless you've got a whole bunch of liver cells filtering the crap out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it. The nearest thing to an artificial liver we're likely to see in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; next decade will be an external support column with a bunch of hepatocytes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (hopefully differentiated from clonal embryonic stem cells) growing in it.
</EM><BR>
<P>This has apparently been achieved, although I don't know how well it worked. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Next, you need oxygenation and perfusion and circulation. This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distinctly non-trivial, without a heart and lungs; we have machines to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do it in operating theatres, but they tend to knock the hell out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; erythrocytes and need a constant dribble of anticoagulants to keep from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clogging up. And then there's haematopoeisis -- all your erythrocytes (red
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blood cells) die by 14 days, so you need to produce a constant supply of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fresh blood. So either you need bone marrow, or your brain is going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be queueing up at the blood bank right behind Dracula.
</EM><BR>
<P>What an image! A brain in a vat with vampire fangs... :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The brain has sod-all immune response. So you need to keep the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing in a clean-room environment like unto a chip fab line -- operating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theatres are _much_ too dirty for this sort of job.
</EM><BR>
<P>It has some immune response from the microglia, but honestly they are
<BR>
more trouble than use - their response to infections leaves much to be
<BR>
desired.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Finally, there's sensory hook-up. We are nowhere near being able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give someone artificial vision (at any level much better than being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to distinguish night from day). Nor do we know how to hook up the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; various cranial nerves to a vocoder. Your disembodied brain is, in fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to be in sensory deprivation hell -- until it succumbs to a passing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; antibiotic-resistant infection, which will happen sooner rather than later
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (because of all the crap we're having to ferry in to keep it alive).
</EM><BR>
<P>On the other hand, keeping it unconscious is quite doable and useful
<BR>
if the brain-in-a-vat stage is just temporary (like when trying to
<BR>
find a body donor).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The best life-support system for a human brain today is still a working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human body. And I don't see this situation changing in less than one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decade. Without spinal regeneration and full-body cloning, or much better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prostheses with working neural control interfaces and sensory feedback, I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't see any medical demand for the Donovan's Brain treatment. (And I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expect those prostheses not to show up -- it's looking right now as if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's a race between bionics and regeneration, and regeneration is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; winning.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Regeneration can still likely be used to improve bionic interfaces by
<BR>
having cultured cells attached to a chip connecting to the brain; this
<BR>
will likely be less common and more expensive if everybody else is
<BR>
using regeneration for the patients, but it would still be important
<BR>
for some forms of paralysis.
