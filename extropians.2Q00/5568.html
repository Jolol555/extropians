<P>
My apologies if I offended you or any other who describe themselves as 
<BR>
atheists. My error, I think, is due to cross definitions. It has always been 
<BR>
my understanding that atheism was the claim that &quot;God does not exist&quot; while 
<BR>
agnosticism was &quot;we make no claim about Godhood&quot;. I again apologize for my 
<BR>
misunderstanding. However, this not being the case, what then is an agnostic?
<BR>
<P>Respectfully,
<BR>
<P>Ronin Cuervo
<BR>
<P>&quot;In this life he's filled with all these good intentions, but he's lived a 
<BR>
lot of things he'd rather not mention.&quot; - Be Like That, 3 Doors Down
