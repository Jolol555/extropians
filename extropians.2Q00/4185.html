</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;When privacy has no value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It will be a boon to all the pedophiles lurking about.. santaclause even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sees you when your sleeping.. He knows when your awake..&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't foresee transparency getting to the point that it is legal for dirty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; old men to leer at people while they are in various states of undress within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the privacy of their own homes.  Perverts will be perverts, but I can't see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their behavior ever getting the sanction of law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Whats all this about it being against the law Zero? I thought you don't think
<BR>
anyone has a right to privacy, so it CAN&quot;T be against the law, by definition.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sure, once tiny and powerful surveillance technology is in the hands of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; masses we will all be vulnerable to the inquisitive and prurient interests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of our neighbors.  But the same tech that threatens us will also be there to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protect us.  It is, of course, a double edged sword.  So you watched me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lounging in the nude last night?  Well guess what?  Someone watched you,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; watching me and now *you're* going to jail.  Nyah, nyah.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not everyone can watch everyone else all the time. Those who do unpleasant
<BR>
things or are unpleasant people will likely be watched much less than the
<BR>
pleasant people will be watched by unpleasant people. Thus it is only a risk
<BR>
that such people will be watched at any given time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Wow nasty double masectomy scars your mother has.. can't she afford breast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reconstruction?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; See above.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Good morning  Jim.. we all saw you materbating on camera last night.. and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;this is not good for our corporate image, your terminated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.  You broke the law by spying on me while I was, er, &quot;massaging&quot; myself.
</EM><BR>
<P>What law is that? If there is a law against violating a person's privacy, then
<BR>
what are all these cameras for? Using your logic, if there is a law protecting
<BR>
your privacy, then there is no need for cameras that violate your privacy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2.  Firing me for doing things on my own time which are not illegal is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against the law.  So now, I will wait til the $billion IPO and sue the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bejesus out of the company for invasion of privacy, wrongful termination,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intentional infliction of emotional distress and any number of federal civil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rights violations and...job?  I don't need no stinkin' job!  Thanks a bunch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boss!!
</EM><BR>
<P>Firing you is only illegal if you have not signed a contract to that effect.
<BR>
With ubiquitous surveillance, employers, government bureaucracies, and political
<BR>
parties will all mandate that their top people sign contracts that they will not
<BR>
engage in un-PC behavior. Once the public sees how well such clauses keep Slick
<BR>
Willy and his kind in check, such requirements will spread to more and more
<BR>
occupations, just as drug tests have done. Violating that contract, even on your
<BR>
own time, means termination.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Hey George.. we should have Insta-patented that idea we discused last night
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;over a few beers.. Suzie has just stolen the whole deal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah Bob, but good thing for us our whole conversation was recorded, as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as the fact that Suzie was listening in.  All we have to do is submit this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data to the Patent Office and her patent never gets issued.  Or better yet,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we could just sit back and see if the idea actually works.  If so, we just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wait til the $billion IPO and sue the bejesus out of her for interference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with prospective business advantage, unfair competition, misappropriation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trade secrets, commercial espionage and...idea?  We don't need no stinkin'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea!  Thanks a bunch Suzie!!
</EM><BR>
<P>If there is no privacy, then there is no misappropriation. Your ideas are public
<BR>
domain as soon as they leave your brain. Heck, I'll bet once surveillance proves
<BR>
to not work well on detering crime, you'll want to put mind taps on people.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Knock Knock. hello!!! We noticed YOU use this non biodegradable tampon..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;please have a free sample of our green friendly tampon !
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey thanks!  It's free *and* green?  Just what I was looking for.  I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really glad you were able to anticipate my needs like that!  Sure beats the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; days when I had to go the the market and hunt up and down the aisle for just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the right kind of widget.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you go back to use  those bad tampons after your free sample is used up you
<BR>
will be publicly excoriated for not being sensitive to the environment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Damnit I'm sick of never getting a &quot;date&quot; because my penis is too small..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Why cant they get to know me first!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would you really be interested in someone who would not date you because of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that?  Would you really be interested in someone who would *break the law*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and violate your privacy to find that out about you?  If you are that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desperate, chances are you would never get a date no matter how big you are.
</EM><BR>
<P>Tell me, who do you think attracts more women? Pee-Wee Herman or Woody Allen?
<BR>
