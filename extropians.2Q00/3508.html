<P>That is what happened to the Whos down in Whoville.  Nice

</EM><BR>
<P>Oh no, on the contrary.  We must provide incentives for parents
<BR>
to raise rotten over-indulged kids.  By producing a generation of
<BR>
truly distasteful offspring, those young couples who have not
<BR>
already borne children would be discouraged from doing so, thus
<BR>
rescuing humanity from the horrifying fate predicted [and programmed
<BR>
into kids from the 60s] that the world's population would go
<BR>
Malthusian, resulting in massive starvation.
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, self-centered unpleasant children would be less likely
<BR>
to themselves be marriageable, thereby further reducing birth rates
<BR>
and the risk of overpopulating the planet.  China is experimenting
<BR>
with this technique, as has America for some time now.  Who
<BR>
would have thought such an intractable problem would have such
<BR>
a simple solution?  spike
