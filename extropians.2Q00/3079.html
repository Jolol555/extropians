Subject: Is there freedom of speech on the Internet in Sweden?
<BR>
<P>Sweden implemented the European Union data directive as a
<BR>
law in 1998. This law formally makes it illegal to mention
<BR>
information about any identifiable individual on the
<BR>
Internet, without prior permission from that person. For
<BR>
example, the law makes it illegal to criticise a public
<BR>
official unless that official permits you to publish the
<BR>
criticism.
<BR>
<P>Because of widespread complaints, the law was modified in
<BR>
1998. The modification says that &quot;minor violations&quot; of the
<BR>
law will not be prosecuted.
<BR>
<P>There are now some decisions by the Swedish Data
<BR>
Inspectorate (the government agency responsible for
<BR>
implementing this law) which shows the limits of what kind
<BR>
of freedom of speech is allowed and not allowed on the
<BR>
Internet in Sweden.
<BR>
<P>How the Data Inspectorate has chosen to interpret the law
<BR>
is shown by some test cases.
<BR>
<P>In the first case, a person who felt that a large Swedish
<BR>
bank had wronged him, published a web page with the title
<BR>
&quot;Swedish Anti-Bank Activity&quot;. In this page, he named a
<BR>
number of bank directors, who, in his opinion, had acted in
<BR>
ethically unacceptable ways. He was prosecuted, and
<BR>
sentenced to fines. This decision was upheld, on appeal, by
<BR>
the first appelate instance. The second appelate instance,
<BR>
the Swedish Highest Court, has not yet decided on this
<BR>
case. One issue which the Swedish Highest court will look
<BR>
like is if you can really regard a web page in the Swedish
<BR>
language to be exported outside Europe, just because the
<BR>
page is formally available to any Internet user, also
<BR>
outside Europe. The lower courts, however, said &quot;yes&quot; on
<BR>
this issue.
<BR>
<P>In the second case, an animal-rights organisation published
<BR>
a list of fur producers in Sweden. This case has not yet
<BR>
been decided on by the Swedish courts, but the Data
<BR>
Inspectorate has asked the prosecutor to prosecute the
<BR>
case.
<BR>
<P>Looking at the way the law is used, one can see that
<BR>
unpopular or controversial opinions are suppressed. In at
<BR>
least the first case, it might be possible that the laws on
<BR>
slander could be used instead, but these laws are more
<BR>
restrictive than the personal information act.
<BR>
<P>In the case of the animal-rights organisation, one might
<BR>
guess (though this is not written anywhere) that this
<BR>
organisation published names of fur manufacturers in order
<BR>
to give information to people performing illegal acts of
<BR>
sabotage against fur farms. And one might guess, that this
<BR>
is the real reason why the personal information act is
<BR>
used, even if this is not officially said.
<BR>
<P>In a third case, the Swedish telephone directory is not
<BR>
available on the Internet for anyone. The reason for this
<BR>
is that in that case, people in countries without adequate
<BR>
security protection might access to phone directory.
<BR>
However, people living in Sweden can get a personal account
<BR>
and password, and can then access the telephone directory
<BR>
from the Internet. Also, the yellow pages are available to
<BR>
anyone, it is only the white pages which are unavailable
<BR>
outside Sweden.
<BR>
<P>One should note, however, that these are exceptional cases.
<BR>
In almost all other cases, the Data Inspectorate has chosen
<BR>
not to act. Note that in all the three cases above, the
<BR>
page did not only contain information about a single
<BR>
individual, it contained lists of names of people. So maybe
<BR>
the act is unofficially not applied to mention of single
<BR>
individuals, although the act itself makes no such
<BR>
distinction. Also, the Data Inspectorate mostly acts when
<BR>
someone complains to them. So a probable reason why we have
<BR>
relatively large freedom of speech on the Internet may
<BR>
simply be that no one has bothered to complain.
<BR>
