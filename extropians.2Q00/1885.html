<P>Curt makes a number of good points, rather bore people with
<BR>
too much discussion of fine points (since I'd like to see some other
<BR>
opinions), I'll only comment on a couple of points.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Real interesting to see your take on this.  I'm in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ecologically oriented biology department, and they say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same thing about diversity - but they like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; biodiversity and don't worry much about plagues,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so they see it as good!
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be real interesting to get some &quot;ecologists&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;microbiologists&quot; and &quot;doctors&quot; in the same room to
<BR>
discuss the relative merits of promoting or limiting the
<BR>
diversity of the biosphere.  I strongly suspect that
<BR>
there would be some more than &quot;mild&quot; disagreements.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Re: hygenic approaches to limiting bio-exposure...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Not a bad approach.  Ideally you would want to retrofit it so its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a permanent add-on.  I have my doubts as to whether that could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;done with biotech.  It might require hard nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We can stop current organisms just fine with current technology. (although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it would be pretty expensive!)  Both autoclaves and 0.22 micron filters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stop anything cellular.  Naturally there will be some leakage, due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to Murphy's law and incompetence.  However, we don't have to stop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *everything*, we just need to get transmission and spread rates of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; novel airborne pathogen down to the point where we can take countermeasures.
</EM><BR>
<P>Remember, that I tend to assume lifespan extending technologies are
<BR>
&quot;virtually&quot; a done-deal.  So each life becomes *much* more valuable.
<BR>
The net wealth accumulation presumably allows hundred-year-olds
<BR>
to spend millions of dollars &quot;protecting&quot; themsleves from possible
<BR>
&quot;accidents&quot;.  When you are spending that kind of money personally
<BR>
to protect yourself, options like dumping biocides worldwide start
<BR>
to appear relatively attractive.
<BR>
<P>I can see the ads now: &quot;Autoclave the world today, so your children
<BR>
can live a bug-free life...&quot;.  Maybe I can get Robert Freitas to
<BR>
do the calculation on how much diamondoid we would need for the
<BR>
autoclave.... :-)
<BR>
<P>It may take a while and perhaps never be completely done, but a complete
<BR>
global genomic bioinventory would allow one to &quot;reasonably&quot; consider this
<BR>
approach since the information loss would be relatively minimal.
<BR>
[Yes, I know some will complain about the loss of learned behaviors
<BR>
and such, but strategies such as extensive filming with ubiquitous
<BR>
cameras, possible future retraining with programmed robots, etc.
<BR>
would suggest that these problems can be worked around.]
<BR>
<P>Please bear in mind that I'm suggesting this tongue-in-cheek (as an
<BR>
exploration of an option no &quot;sane&quot; person would seriously consider).
