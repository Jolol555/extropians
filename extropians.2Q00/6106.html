<P>
<EM>&gt; I dont know how to deal with deniability of archived posts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other than to request a complete version of any quoted post
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and a request to confirm my authorship.    spike
</EM><BR>
<P>In the early days of the extropians list, there was a policy that archives
<BR>
were not allowed.  Each person was expected to agree not to store or
<BR>
publish any messages from other participants without their permission.
<BR>
<P>I think this was mostly to address the PR problem.  People were afraid
<BR>
that if they knew their words would come back to haunt them, they
<BR>
would censor themselves and we could not have a fully free intellectual
<BR>
discussion.
<BR>
<P>The early days of the list were heady and exciting.  I don't believe
<BR>
they were quite the &quot;golden age&quot; that some have suggested, but IMO they
<BR>
were the equal of many of our most productive periods.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the viewpoint of historical completeness, it is unfortunate that
</EM><BR>
no publishable record exists of those discussions.  (I would guess
<BR>
that individuals did keep at least partial archives in violation of
<BR>
the agreement, but they may have been lost by now and may never be made
<BR>
public.)  But at least it was one way to largely solve the PR problem.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps some thought could be given to the creation of a more freewheeling
<BR>
counterpoint to the extropians list, one which required agreement to a
<BR>
no-archive policy.  (I am presently on one mailing list which has such
<BR>
a policy.)  Then perhaps certain threads could be shunted to that list
<BR>
if they were getting into unacceptable territory.
<BR>
<P>Here's another idea, which just popped into my head.  It doesn't help
<BR>
with the &quot;extropians believe X&quot; taunt, but it would prevent individuals
<BR>
from being linked to their comments in the archives.
<BR>
<P>Imagine a &quot;pseudonymizing&quot; mail list.  Everyone who posts gets their
<BR>
name transformed into a pseudonym which is a deterministic but secret
<BR>
function of the email address (for example, the md5sum of a fixed secret
<BR>
string concatenated to the email address).  These are put in as the
<BR>
&quot;From&quot; addresses.
<BR>
<P>The idea is that each person gets a pseudonym, which will be stable over
<BR>
time as long as their email address remains the same.  People would
<BR>
get to know the personalities and characteristics of the pseudonyms,
<BR>
and the mailing list would have much the same &quot;feel&quot; as an ordinary list.
<BR>
It might even be that it was easy to make a guess about the real names of
<BR>
some of the pseudonyms.  The idea is not so much to have high security,
<BR>
but rather effective deniability.
<BR>
<P>By putting the work into the mailing list server it makes the list much
<BR>
easier to use.  You could even make it somewhat fun by using one of the
<BR>
funny-name generators on the web to create the pseudonyms.
<BR>
<P>Not a very well thought out idea, but perhaps some will like it -
<BR>
