<P>Bring em on, we'll bust em all!  {8-]  You bring up a good point: there
<BR>
are plenty of ways to deliver a nuke.  The systems that are being proposed
<BR>
do not deal with everything, just the ICBMs.  For that reason, they do not
<BR>
violate the ABM treaty of 1972.  They are not designed to defeat a massive
<BR>
attack by an advanced foe, but rather a limited attack by crazies and
<BR>
terrorists.  The current systems are just a start.
<BR>
<P>Actually I myself doubt the WMD of choice will ever be a nuke.
<BR>
Plutonium is just too hard to get, too hard to make, too hard to
<BR>
handle.  Uranium is not that much easier.  I suspect we will be
<BR>
looking at bioagents sooner than we would see a nuke.
<BR>
<P>Of course, I am straying from the original argument here, which
<BR>
is the question of whether national missile defense is even possible.
<BR>
I argue that it is feasible, and will leave the politics to the politicians.
<BR>
<P>Speaking of which, I was amused and alarmed to hear some of the
<BR>
arguments being used by the anti-NMD senator on the TV news
<BR>
this morning.  He said that the NMD was so vulnerable that it has
<BR>
a number of soft radar sites, so that if any one of these is taken out
<BR>
the whole system is useless.  Nowthen, it doesnt take an extropian
<BR>
to figure out that *no* weapon system is designed with multiple
<BR>
single-point failure modes and zero redundancy.  That would be like
<BR>
the scene from Star Wars where they knocked out the control
<BR>
system and all the fighter droids went dead.  {8^D  My amusement was
<BR>
at this senator's ability to tell such a tale with a straight face, alarmed
<BR>
that we have an elected decision maker who might be dumb enough
<BR>
to believe his own story.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You've already admitted that defense is much more expensive than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offence so just building more defense is simply not going to work unless your resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are infinite. They're not.
</EM><BR>
<P>I could have made this clearer.  In an ABM system, the cost is in the
<BR>
design and development stages.  Production is cheap, way cheap in
<BR>
comparison to that.  Once we design a space based laser system, an
<BR>
airborn laser system, a THAAD, they can crank out copies by the
<BR>
zillions.  It is pretty much analogous to building the first copy machine
<BR>
as compared to the cost of making copies on it afterwards.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;if I just buy some paint at Home Depot and paint my warhead white you'll have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;increase the power of your LASER about a hundred times.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure that somebody involved in the project had taken Physics in High School so the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea must have been tossed around.
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.  Recall that the photons that come out of the business end of
<BR>
a laser have *already* passed thru a highly reflective surface.  {8-]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However they concluded, quite correctly, that it had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing to do with the main function of the system, to provide employment for themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and their friends.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, a conspiracy theorist among us.  I have a hard time buying that
<BR>
for the following reasons:
<BR>
<P>1) those who design and build missile defense systems are not hurting
<BR>
for employment.  They could make waaay more money elsewhere, but
<BR>
dont.
<BR>
<P>2) there is not huge profit in most of the missile defense systems for
<BR>
aerospace companies, reason: the profitability of the phases of pretty
<BR>
much any space program increases as you go along.  The first phase,
<BR>
bid and proposal phase is usually a dead loss.  The early development
<BR>
stages are a breakeven if all goes well.  The prototype and test phase
<BR>
makes some money, but the real money is in the manufacturing.  Thats
<BR>
why all the headlines from the aerospace companies are about who
<BR>
will get the staggeringly profitable F22 contract and the Joint Strike
<BR>
Fighter.  Both LM and Boeing consider it a win or die contract.
<BR>
<P>THAAD is so-so on the profitability scale, since it is a lotta
<BR>
development, not so much production.  But the real heart of national
<BR>
missile defense is almost totally low-profitability development and very
<BR>
little high-profit production.  That might explain why they havent been
<BR>
lobbying for it much.  Makes sense to me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I mean, if the system is ever actually needed nobody expects to be held
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accountable afterward when it fails to work as promised.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats right.  If that system is needed and fails, being held accountable is
<BR>
the very least of our worries.  I would do everything I can to make
<BR>
sure the thing does work.  spike
