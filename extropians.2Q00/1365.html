<P><EM>&gt; I checked out the model plane club that meets at the Moffett
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Field blimp hangar yesterday to see how far they were from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  having the ability to violate our privacy rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Answer: close.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  A couple of developments: they have autostabilized four
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  prop electric helicopters which have the payload capacity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to carry a small transmitting camera.  Next, they have small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  transmitting cameras.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you saying there already are autostabilized helicopters?  This would be a 
<BR>
big improvement over the technology I am familiar with.  Up till about ten 
<BR>
years ago I dabbled in RC aircraft.  It's NOT simple or easy to learn to fly. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Not only do you have to have a pretty damned good grasp of basic 
<BR>
aerodynamics and flight dynamics, but you ALSO have to master the dreaded 
<BR>
&quot;turn-around problem&quot;, i.e. learning to pilot a vehicle that YOU'RE NOT IN - 
<BR>
when it's travelling TOWARD you.  (The &quot;turn-around problem&quot; in RC exhibits 
<BR>
itself when a novice pilot gets turned around as her aircraft is heading 
<BR>
toward her and, going to make a horizontal flight path correction, she makes 
<BR>
the opposite one from the one intended, exacerbating the problem.  You can 
<BR>
spot this one easily - an otherwise airworthy plane heading toward the pilot 
<BR>
all of a sudden goes into a tighter and tighter spiral, resulting in . . . 
<BR>
BANG!)
<BR>
<P>Another problem (especially with sailplanes, which I mainly flew) is not 
<BR>
having one's inner ear or other subtle momentum cues as a guide to finely 
<BR>
gauging the aircraft's energy.  In sailplanes in particular, this results in 
<BR>
what I used to call &quot;the stall reflex&quot;, i.e. &quot;got a problem? Pull back on the 
<BR>
stick!&quot;  Naturally you can only do so much of this before you're either 
<BR>
looping or, eventually, using up all the aircraft's momentum.  This results 
<BR>
in, at best, embarrassing porpoising and, at worst, a stall followed by a 
<BR>
dive, followed by â€¦BANG!
<BR>
<P>(Of course, there's also the problem of launching a sailplane off the 
<BR>
catapult with the receiver switched off.  This is a very humorous situation 
<BR>
where the seasoned pilot - yours truly - lofts the graceful two-meter bird 
<BR>
that he's spent dozens of hours building off the step and twiddles the sticks 
<BR>
helplessly as it accelerates up and over into a fast return to earth . . . 
<BR>
BANG!)
<BR>
<P>(Which is not to say that all of my air time ended badly - during my best 
<BR>
summer I got to the point where I could keep a sailplane aloft essentially 
<BR>
indefinitely.  Many were the hours I spent chasing hawks from one thermal to 
<BR>
another, which is one of the truly coolest things to do in the world.  The 
<BR>
little whirring sounds of the control surface servos interest the big soaring 
<BR>
raptors and I've spent hours gently playing with them in their own 
<BR>
environment, the great warm ocean of air above the coastal Texas prairie.)
<BR>
<P>It wouldn't surprise me if the RC nuts are now starting to incorporate 
<BR>
microelectronics and on-board logic to begin to address these things.  But of 
<BR>
course, the best thing would be to get a relatively high-bandwidth 2-way 
<BR>
digital radio circuit going . . . When that happens (and I don't have to work 
<BR>
so much that I'm too often on the bad part of the learning curve), I'll be 
<BR>
back in the air in a heartbeat.
