<EM>&gt; droplets ooze down the side leaving trails of color through the

<EM>&gt; alcoholic to drink
</EM><BR>
<P>==
<BR>
<P>I was sitting on the park bench with Rwanda, the birds fluttering
<BR>
gracefully through the almost shamefully blue sky.  Out of habit, I
<BR>
identified the surveillance drones; a CIA sparrow, an FBI robin, a
<BR>
bluetit from the Men In Black, and a flock of honking ducks that was
<BR>
probably one of the Illuminati's newfangled distributed devices.  The
<BR>
sun was partially obscured by the very edge of a few thin streamers of
<BR>
cloud; just enough to let us look up at the sky without wincing, not
<BR>
enough to change the feeling of sunniness.  It was an almost indecently
<BR>
perfect day, as if someone had broken into NASA's satellite weather
<BR>
system and made a few modifications.
<BR>
<P>&quot;So, have you ever really looked at a rainbow?&quot; Rwanda was saying, her
<BR>
legs dangling over the park bench.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; I said.
<BR>
<P>&quot;And the colors are all bunched up, right?  They come in bands?&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; I said again.  Then I saw where she was going.  &quot;Hey,
<BR>
yeah.  If rainbows are really caused by diffraction effects, then the
<BR>
frequency should change linearly over distance.&quot;  I started laughing. 
<BR>
&quot;I'm such a moron!  I can't believe I didn't see that one before!  So
<BR>
what do you suppose they really are?&quot;
<BR>
<P>She smiled.  &quot;Well, suppose that those UFOs we keep seeing aren't
<BR>
*really* working with the Trilateral Commission...&quot;  She trailed off,
<BR>
looking to my right.  I turned my head.
<BR>
<P>A thin, scruffy man, in a dirty brown overcoat, was walking towards our
<BR>
bench.  His eyes were wild.  &quot;I've got it!&quot; he hissed.  &quot;I've got it all
<BR>
worked out!&quot;  Rwanda and I scooted closer to listen to the whisper.
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's all so simple,&quot; he said, pausing dramatically.  &quot;*Lee Harvey
<BR>
Oswald, acting alone, shot John F. Kennedy!*&quot;
<BR>
<P>I heard Rwanda's sharp intake of breath, and my eyes grew wide.  &quot;Hey,
<BR>
man, be careful,&quot; I hissed.  &quot;There's a bluetit from the Men In Black
<BR>
listening to us not five feet away!&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;The Men In Black?&quot; he asked scornfully.  &quot;There's no such thing!  And a
<BR>
bluetit?  What kind of paranoid fantasy is that?  There's nobody
<BR>
listening to us.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I let out a disappointed breath.  It was just another nutter.  We've
<BR>
been getting those from time to time, ever since they started using
<BR>
Windows NT on the Orbital Mind Control Lasers.  The Men In Black would
<BR>
probably be around to pick him up shortly.
<BR>
<P>Rwanda must have felt sympathetic, since she kept on talking to him. 
<BR>
&quot;But you must know that the Men In Black exist,&quot; she said gently. 
<BR>
&quot;Didn't you see that movie?&quot;
<BR>
<P>The man started eyeing us nervously, like *we* were the nutters.  &quot;Yes,&quot;
<BR>
he said, &quot;but it was just a movie.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; Rwanda said, &quot;have you ever seen one of those little flashing
<BR>
memory-eraser devices?&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; said the man.
<BR>
<P>&quot;So you don't ever remember seeing one of them?&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; said the man.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; Rwanda said gently, &quot;there you go.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The man started to speak, then halted.  &quot;Oh, that's just bloody
<BR>
nonsense,&quot; he sputtered.  I grabbed Rwanda's arm.  &quot;Don't argue with
<BR>
him,&quot; I whispered.  &quot;He could be dangerous.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Fortunately, at that moment, the limousine pulled up.  I let out a
<BR>
breath, relaxed.  &quot;You took your sweet time,&quot; I said.
<BR>
<P>One of the Men In Black nodded.  &quot;Sorry, sir.  Ever since we started
<BR>
using Windows CE in the bluetits, it's been nothing but trouble.&quot;  The
<BR>
other two MIBs grabbed the crazy by the arm and started wrestling him
<BR>
into the car.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Don't listen to them!&quot; he shrieked.  &quot;Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone,
<BR>
shot John F. Kennedy!  Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone, shot John F.
<BR>
Kennedy!  Lee Harvey Oswald -&quot;
<BR>
<P>The limousine door closed on his outburst, leaving the park in blessed
<BR>
silence.  The Man In Black held up one of the blinky-flashy things.  &quot;If
<BR>
I could trouble you to look over here, sir?  And please take off those
<BR>
glasses.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I blinked.  &quot;The glasses?  Oh, I'd forgotten I had those on. 
<BR>
Certainly.&quot;  I took the glasses off my face, looked, blinked and -
<BR>
<P>&quot;...aren't *really* working with the Trilateral Commission,&quot; Rwanda was
<BR>
saying.  I had that odd feeling of disorientation that cued me to glance
<BR>
at my shoelaces; sure enough, I'd untied one of them, but had no memory
<BR>
of doing so.
<BR>
<P>I nudged her.  &quot;Hey, Rwanda.  MIBs again.&quot;
<BR>
<P>==
<BR>
<P>This is Harvey Newstrom.
<BR>
This is Harvey Newstrom on drugs.
<BR>
Any questions?
