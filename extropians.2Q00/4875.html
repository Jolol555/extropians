<EM>&gt; If I'm Microsoft, I can tell Dell to ship a copy of Office with every PC

<EM>&gt; or I'll decline to license them my OS and put them out of business.
</EM><BR>
<P>That isn't force. Besides, it is a power that absolutely must exist if we
<BR>
are to have anything even resembling a free market. If a business can't
<BR>
decide the terms under which it will sell its product, you've pretty much
<BR>
gutted competition. The result will be an anemic, dysfunctional market that
<BR>
invites even more intervention.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If I'm IBM and I don't like something your startup is doing, I can do a
</EM><BR>
search on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; my patent database, find a couple of dozen you could plausibly be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violating, and - right or wrong - bankrupt you in court.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here you have a valid point, but the problem isn't with the market. Rather,
<BR>
it is the fact that the U.S. civil justice system is badly broken. The
<BR>
solution is to fix the justice system (with a looser-pays rule, penalties
<BR>
for filing frivolous lawsuits, or other such measures).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the long run, as they say, we're all dead. Just because a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't last forever doesn't mean it can't do a lot of damage in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean time.
</EM><BR>
<P>My point is that the traditional approach to 'solving' these problems
<BR>
actually makes them worse, because it short-circuits the mechanisms that
<BR>
would normally act to erode monopoly power. I don't object (in principle) to
<BR>
the idea of fixing problems where they occur, but I want the solution to
<BR>
actually be an improvement over leaving things alone.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Gates isn't evil, he's just an asshole, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Windows wouldn't have succeeded if it didn't have some merit.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they're not very nice people, and, having often watched them trample
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people smaller than themselves, I can't really muster much sympathy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they're abused by someone bigger yet. Live by the sword, die by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sword. I am not greatly moved by MSFT's uncomfortable discovery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the world is an unfair place or that it too can be the victim of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dirty tactics. Nor will I shed a tear for the property rights of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; richest man in history.
</EM><BR>
<P>The true test of any system of rights is whether it protects the people that
<BR>
no one likes. If Microsoft can be subjected to arbitrary, senseless (and
<BR>
expensive) penalties just because it is unpopular, then so can anyone else
<BR>
the public doesn't like. Since I qualify as a member of at least a
<BR>
half-dozen unpopular groups, I find that a rather ominous trend.
