<P><EM>&gt; I wonder if extropians have resistance to consumerist memes, if only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because we pay attention to information sources other than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumerist media?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're post describing yourself seemed to describe me exactly.
<BR>
I've got my stereo speakers, cars, house(only this with a little
<BR>
remaining to pay of).... many years ago, who needs new ones?  Even my
<BR>
home computer is still an old upgraded P5/90.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the stock market keeps going up, I'll be able to pay cash
<BR>
for my cryonics membership in about 10 years or less.  That,
<BR>
retirement as soon as possible, and leaving funds for my kids so they
<BR>
can continue the growth, hopefully by them also living within their
<BR>
means, is by far my biggest goal.  Like you, I hate &quot;stuff&quot;.  I guess
<BR>
expensive food is my weakness, largely because it doesn't collect.
<BR>
