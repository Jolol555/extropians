[ Just a bit of late night writing ]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From Encyclopaedia Galactica, 456th Edition, Sagittarius Cluster:
</EM><BR>
<P>The Zombie Era
<BR>
<P>also called the consciousness struggle or zombie wars, time period of
<BR>
human (q.v.) culture from 2023 to around 2058 (local calendar)
<BR>
affected by the discoveries in neuropsychology that strongly
<BR>
threatened traditional philosophical systems. In 2022 the
<BR>
Henton-Kitano explanation of consciousness (a mental property of inner
<BR>
experience regarded as highly central by humans; other conscious
<BR>
species include the tesselators (q.v.) and the drones of the Grand
<BR>
Confluence (q.v)) was discovered. The following year it was tested
<BR>
using the newly developed URBS (Ultrafine Resolution Brain Scanners,
<BR>
q.v.) and firmly validated. Using a scanner it was now possible to
<BR>
detect the existence of inner experience in humans. While the impact
<BR>
of this on human philosophy was profound, the discovery of the Shalwar
<BR>
Condition proved explosive. It was found that approximately 3% of all
<BR>
humans lacked consciousness at all times due to a natural variation in
<BR>
brain structure. Their outward behaviour was indistinguishable from
<BR>
normal humans. The humans with the Shalwar Condition became popularly
<BR>
known as zombies or consciousness challenged (CCs).
<BR>
<P>The implications of the Shalwar Condition on human culture, philosophy
<BR>
and politics were profound. Traditional human ethics, especially the
<BR>
green moralism (q.v) prevalent in the 2020 period, was based on the
<BR>
assumption of humans (and in the case of green moralism some other
<BR>
selected lifeforms) as having consciousness. To aggravate the
<BR>
situation, this assumption had not been codified in most systems due
<BR>
to its apparent obviousness, prompting intense debate over how to
<BR>
adjust them to fit the new facts. While the majority of humans
<BR>
regarded individuals with Shalwar Condition as people with all the
<BR>
rights of conscious people, vocal groups claimed they lacked the
<BR>
essential property necessary for rights or personhood. In many nations
<BR>
nondiscrimination laws were passed, but prejudice or emotional unease
<BR>
with non-conscious people was widespread.
<BR>
<P>The situation was further worsened by the appearance of handheld URBS
<BR>
in 2038, making it possible to surreptitiously check for the presence
<BR>
of consciousness in other humans. Violence, several political scandals
<BR>
and increased polarisation between consciousness supremacists and
<BR>
non-conscious rights activists followed. In a few nations (q.v.) such
<BR>
as the later period Reunified Scandinavian Republic and the Concordate
<BR>
of Lebanon laws were passed denying humans with the Shalwar Condition
<BR>
rights due to their lack of inner experience; it was considered
<BR>
ethically neutral to inflict pain or other negative emotional states
<BR>
on them. The International Arts Association declared that
<BR>
non-conscious artists could not be members as their art was clearly
<BR>
not derived from an inner life.
<BR>
<P>In 2046 the Henton-Kitano explanation was applied to the simple
<BR>
artificial intelligence software that was emerging, and it was found
<BR>
that it could be conscious (likely due to the implicit mental
<BR>
assumptions of their builders). By increasing the number of
<BR>
self-representation loops (q.v.) the quantity and quality of
<BR>
consciousness of the software could be increased beyond what was
<BR>
biologically possible for humans. One application of this technology
<BR>
was the introduction of prosthetic consciousness chips, which could
<BR>
give humans with the Shalwar Condition consciousness. Over the next 12
<BR>
years widespread implantation of consciousness prosthetics led to the
<BR>
near total eradication of non-conscious people. The practice of adding
<BR>
consciousness prosthesises continued until the encounter with the
<BR>
Kelderu species (q.v.) in 2194 and subsequent uplink with the galactic
<BR>
network, which spelled the end of the particular human assumption that
<BR>
consciousness was essential.
