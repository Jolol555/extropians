Preservation and Resuscitation of Rat Isolated Heart for 10-26 Days in
<BR>
Perfluorocarbon and Silica Gel
<BR>
<P>Seki, K.
<BR>
<P>Cryobiology 39(4): 305-306 December 1999
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Abstract:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical transplants of human lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and 
<BR>
pancreas are routinely performed today. However, with the number of people
<BR>
waiting for transplants increasing yearly, the shortage of donors has
<BR>
become a serious problem, prolonging the waiting time until
<BR>
surgery. Moreover, at present even if a donor is found, organs, unlike
<BR>
blood, cannot be preserved over long periods, and the supply system for
<BR>
such organs remains inadequate. the inability to preserve donor organs for
<BR>
long periods is the main reason why no system similar to a blood bank for
<BR>
organs exist. Cold preservation of transplant organs is the mainstream
<BR>
practice, but because of the preservation limit of 4-24 h, a new technique
<BR>
for immediate preservation and later resuscitation is needed. Here we
<BR>
demostrate through surface cardiac electrocardiogram (SECG) recordings 
<BR>
that a removed rat isolated heart, which has been surrounded by silica gel
<BR>
in a wire mesh sieve, immersed in perfluorocarbon solution, and
<BR>
refrigerated at 4 C for 10-26 days, can be resuscited upon irrgation with
<BR>
a Langendorff perfusion solution and that the nerve cells continue to
<BR>
function and support life. The idea that removed rat hearts could survive
<BR>
more than 10-26 days under ischemic conditions came from the discovery of
<BR>
Seki and Toyoshima 1998, Nature 395, 853-854 that, under anhydrous
<BR>
conditions, tardigrades had the viability to withstand high hydrostatic
<BR>
pressures of up to 600 MPa. We reasoned that lengthening the rat isolated
<BR>
heart preservation period would depend not on the components of the
<BR>
storage solution, but on the absolute amount of free water, and that
<BR>
resuscitation after a long preservation period would be possible by
<BR>
providing the same conditions for the physiological mechanisms of 
<BR>
dehydration and water absorption within the cells of the heart tissue as
<BR>
were used with the tardigrades. In future, studies to verify the present
<BR>
findings will be necessary. In conclusion, the present study: (1) verified
<BR>
by SECGs that an extirpated rat isolated heart could be preserved for at
<BR>
least 10-26 days and successfully resuscitated and, (2) demonstrated that
<BR>
preservation and resuscitation of an extirpated rat heart is made possible
<BR>
by active reduction of free water in tissue cells.
