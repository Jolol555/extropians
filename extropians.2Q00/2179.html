<EM>&gt; The work by Bennett, Landauer, etc. say the &quot;cost&quot; in computing is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cost of erasing information.  For example, if I have a capacitor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; storing some electrons, there is a heat produced in removing those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electrons to discharge the capacitor.  They way you reduce this problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is to allow the capacitor to charge and discharge very slowly (along the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas of reversible computing).  However in a virtual world it isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clear to me that those constraints exist.  If you have the freedom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to design the ecology, could there be a way that allows the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; virtual erasure of some information to result in the virtual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creation of other information (along the lines of allowing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the electrons to cycle between two capacitors).  You have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to design the system so that the transforms on the information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; waste less energy than similar transforms using &quot;real&quot; atoms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or molecules.  For example -- can I design a virtual system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where the energy cost of breaking a virtual C=C bond is cheaper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than the energy cost of breaking a real C=C bond (~1.19 aJ)?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we have some level-crossing confusion going on here.
<BR>
<P>The thing you have to remember about a VR is that it isn't an alternate
<BR>
universe. Any transformation that happens in the virtual world has to be
<BR>
implemented as an actual transformation on real particles in a physical
<BR>
system. It doesn't have to be the *same* transformation, but it has to be
<BR>
*some* transformation of equal or greater information content. No matter how
<BR>
cleverly you design the VR, it will always have this constraint due to the
<BR>
simple fact that the virtual world has no independent existence.
<BR>
<P>Now, of course you can simulate an event for less energy than it takes for
<BR>
the real event to happen. We do that all the time, and the relative
<BR>
efficiency will only grow as we find better ways to do the simulations. But
<BR>
the reason we can do that is because we discard all of the information we
<BR>
aren't interested in, instead of keeping it all. What you want is a way to
<BR>
have extra bits in the VR that don't exist anywhere in the physical world,
<BR>
or &quot;free&quot; computations that don't have to be performed by the underlying
<BR>
system. Unfortunately, neither of these things is possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ah, but there are many examples, say from mathematics, where a simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; formula can represent a huge amount of information.  Moravec's article
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; points out how optimizing compilers can transform one representation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a process into a much more efficient representation.  The Transmeta
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efforts show how you can design a machine that can refine processes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into increasingly efficient operations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but any transformation that could be used to improve the efficiency of
<BR>
a virtual computer can also be used to improve the efficiency of a real one.
<BR>
Or, to put it another way, a physical computer can use arbitrarily complex
<BR>
and abstract operations. Making a simulated computer doesn't get you any
<BR>
benefits you couldn't have gotten with a suitable abstraction layer, and it
<BR>
imposes a lot more overhead.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree there always has to be a physical representation.  But almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all &quot;information&quot; in the current &quot;real&quot; world is represented in atoms,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atomic bonds, electric charges in specific locations, etc.  I'm thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; along the lines of a &quot;virtual&quot; computer where the information is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; represented by photons at specific positions in space.  It seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely that a computer of that type (i.e. no matter, other than that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; required to produce the photons), could potentially have a much higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information density than &quot;matter&quot; based computers or Moravec's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Higgsinium or Monopolium (that are still based on &quot;atomic&quot; models).
</EM><BR>
<P>If photonic computers are the way to go, the efficient approach is to
<BR>
actually build one. Running it on some other kind of computer as a
<BR>
simulation doesn't get you anything - simply running a computation is always
<BR>
more efficient that running a simulation of a computer doing the same
<BR>
computation.
