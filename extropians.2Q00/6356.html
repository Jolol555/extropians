I've heard that the age of armor (tanks) is over with the invention of 
<BR>
shoulder launched anti tank rockets....but is that true?

<P>Greg Burch replied:
<BR>
Like the aircraft carrier, the death of the tank has been prophesied for 
<BR>
sometime. I do think the big lumbering giant M-1 is the last in that line; a 
<BR>
real dinosaur. I see the armored vehicle of 2025 as very light, very fast 
<BR>
and very smart. And maybe on legs instead of tracks.

<P>Do any of your remember the Steve Jackson microgame series _Ogre_?  The star 
<BR>
of the game was a late 21st century battletank(more like a battleship) the 
<BR>
size of a football field which had the firepower to take out multiple 
<BR>
targets on the land and in the air.  It's armor supposedly made it capable 
<BR>
of taking multiple direct hits and still keep going.   It was the high-tech 
<BR>
equivalent of a fire breathing dragon!
<BR>
<P>My favorite strategy when I played without an Ogre unit myself was to slow 
<BR>
my friend's ogre down with closeup attacks carried out by expendable units 
<BR>
like infantry and light armor.  Than I would use the extremely damaging, 
<BR>
long-range heavy artillery units I had to chip away at and destroy his metal 
<BR>
monstrosity.
<BR>
<P>Anyone else here play the microgames?  Remember _Chitin_, Ice War_, 
<BR>
_Invasion of the Air Eaters_, and _Warp War_ to name a few?  Interestingly, 
<BR>
Steve Jackson has an interest in cryonics and has posted on Cryonet a few 
<BR>
times.  I can't wait to play his postsingularity games! :)
<BR>
