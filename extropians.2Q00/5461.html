</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; winners again is new materials tech that allows a lower-mass pushrod.

<P>Hmmm now Im more curious than ever.  Composites wouldnt be any
<BR>
good for that purpose and I dont know of any materials breakthrus
<BR>
in the past several years in metals, unless they are using one of those
<BR>
new tricky sintering technologies.  But I wouldnt think that would be
<BR>
any good for a part as big as a rocker arm or a pushrod.  Curious.

<P><EM>&gt;  The benefits of getting rid of a long timing belt or chain, with all the lash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems and tension-maintenance issues they give rise to, may offset the

<EM>&gt; reciprocating mass cost of the pushrods.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, but I would think the answer to timing chain lash is a direct shaft
<BR>
drive with bevel gears for the overhead cam shafts.  That system is
<BR>
still reasonably light, reliable and very durable under high revs.
<BR>
<P>I notice the motorcycle world going back to push rods, which shocks
<BR>
me, but I assumed the reason was to imitate Harley Davidson.  Have
<BR>
you seen the Japanese Harley clones?  Yamaha is building one that is
<BR>
so Harley-like you need to be right next to it to tell the difference:
<BR>
pushrod, fat bob tank, softtail-like back-end, air cooled 98 CI Vtwin,
<BR>
even a belt final drive.  They must stopped.  I want one.  {8^D  spike
