<EM>&gt; &gt; Also, in his _The Mismeasure of Man_, I think his goal is quite clear:
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; blacken the notion of general intelligence so badly as to make it
</EM><BR>
completely
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unpalatable.  This he does not only by direct assault -- which, by the
</EM><BR>
way,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  he fails at -- but also by juxtaposing it with phrenology and the like.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  I.e., he tries to associate what he does not like but might have some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  credence with what is generally thought to be ridiculous.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You see, already having discounted IQ testing at about age twelve, I did
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; walk away from that book with that &quot;goal&quot; in mind. What I saw as his
</EM><BR>
&quot;goal&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; was to show how even scientists who truly believe they are doing honest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research are mislead by their own beliefs, even him.
</EM><BR>
<P>IQ testing might be flawed, but the notion of general intelligence might not
<BR>
be.  My point was not to support either, but to show that Gould is using
<BR>
faulty arguments.  Specifically, the juxtaposition I talk about above.
<BR>
Also, if his goal &quot;was to show how even scientists who truly believe they
<BR>
are doing honest research are mislead by their own beliefs,&quot; he's very
<BR>
one-sided.
<BR>
<P>I've read several of his books and his view seems to be this.  Anyone who
<BR>
supports a view which can be used against his egalitarian politics is
<BR>
obviously bad intentioned, while if someone knowingly distorts a view to
<BR>
support his eqalitarian politics, then that person is merely mistaken.
<BR>
<P>For instance, in _Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of
<BR>
History_ -- incidentally, my favorite book of his -- he does his best to
<BR>
paint Walcott as a farty conservative bigot.  Granted, Walcott missed a
<BR>
great opportunity, was extremely nearsighted (intellectually, that is), and
<BR>
was also guilty of the &quot;shoehorning&quot; Gould accuses him of, but was this
<BR>
because of Walcott's political views?  (Note also, he does not go into the
<BR>
politics of Harry Whittington, Derek Briggs, or Conway Morris.)  I came away
<BR>
from the book, which I recommend, with the view that Gould wanted his
<BR>
readers to believe so.
<BR>
<P>Again: this is not a matter of me disagreeing with Gould's politics.  (I
<BR>
disagree with Albert Einstein's politics, which are laughable, but that
<BR>
doesn't color my view of his spacetime theories.  I imagine if Gould were a
<BR>
Conservative and he wrote on Einstein, he would trace relativity theory back
<BR>
to Einstein's socialism and debunk it from there.:)  It's a matter of me
<BR>
disagreeing with his reduction of everything else to politics or class
<BR>
interest motives.  (A very Marxist view of the world: everything is class
<BR>
interest.  Walcott was a rich, white male, so he had to support a certain
<BR>
ideology, namely conservativism.)  Surely, all sorts of thinkers err, but
<BR>
they do not always err because of their political views.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
