<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; I didn't know we lived in a oppressive society? A question: since Europeans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; live in an oppressive society and legal system, how come we never riot as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; it happens in LA? No racism?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Never riot?  Perhaps there are Europeans, and Europeans.  When I lived in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Zurich, I saw a very nice, full-out riot in the center of the city - complete
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with broken windows up and down the Bahnhofstrasse, riot police, looting, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anything else you might want.  I also saw skinhead attacks more than once,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and quite blatant police brutality numerous times.  I actually became more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;concerned for my safety walking around there sometimes than I am home in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;NYC - because in Zurich, I found I wasn't able to accurately sense that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;situation was becoming dangerous - the violent things I saw happen seemed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to come out of nowhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So Zurich stopped being a member of my &quot;future places to visit&quot; list.

<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't know what kind of exaggeration you get on your media, but we see all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;kinds of rioting in the news going on in europe: the french on trade and labor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reforms, the germans against immigrants, then you've got your organized violence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in the Balkan states.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let me remind you of my words: &quot;. . . how come we never riot as it happens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in LA?&quot; Skinheads attacks are not riots as it happens in LA. The Yugoslavia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; war is not a riot, it's a war (what's next, WW2?) Soccer fans rioting on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; square -- destroying cars, robbing stores, etc. -- is not a riot as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happens in LA. I didn't said there were no riots in Europe; I said European
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; riots are nothing close to US ones.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>So its not that they don't happen, just that you claim that yours are
<BR>
qualitatively different than ours. Have you ever been in an LA riot? What
<BR>
parameters do you use to judge which riots are 'better'?
<BR>
<P>It is quite arguable that warfare is merely widespread organized rioting. This
<BR>
is something that europeans seem to excel at, which is why a european has about
<BR>
a 50 times higher risk of dying a violent death at some point in his life than
<BR>
an American. Its therefore understandable that you'd like to disregard deaths
<BR>
during war as somehow not 'counting' towards 'violent crime'. Considering the
<BR>
number of people convicted of war crimes after both world wars, its rather
<BR>
obvious that any deaths that occured during either world war were in fact,
<BR>
violent crimes. If the Nazis were in fact war criminals, then all the people who
<BR>
died during the war they started were in fact victims of violent crime.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Although I don't have stats I'm pretty sure that, for example, Spain or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Italy have higher non-violent crime rates than the US.
</EM><BR>
<P>Britain has far higher non-violent crime rates than the US. Britain's property
<BR>
crime rates are five times higher than the US. I would accept that countries
<BR>
like Switzerland would have  lower crime rates than the US, then again,
<BR>
Switzerland has a higher rate of gun ownership than the US as well, fancy that.
