<P>Huh? Now you are making no sense at all.  What &quot;If&quot;?? That's the whole point, no
<BR>
one has yet been able to duplicate any said function.  You're caught in some
<BR>
weird self referential tautology!  You might want to clear your head and start
<BR>
reading this discussion from the beginning since the crux of this argument has
<BR>
obviously lost you.
<BR>
<P>As the 1992 study of the Purkinje demonstrates, it was an extremely difficult
<BR>
task to simulate the function of a single neuron - and this was an admittedly
<BR>
simplified simulation at that.  It took an i860 processor almost 60 minutes to
<BR>
simulate a single firing!  So the question still remains how many xflops it's
<BR>
going to take to simulate a *typical* neuron of the human brain not including
<BR>
any of its self-maintenance functions.
<BR>
<P>So far both Robin Hanson and Anders Sandberg admit that a single transistor
<BR>
isn't going to do the job.  That much we all agree on.  What exactly are you
<BR>
arguing?
