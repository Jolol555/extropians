<EM>&gt; This past monday, in case it wasn't in your local paper (and considering
</EM><BR>
they
<BR>
<EM>&gt; way they lean usually, it probably wasn't), the Supreme Court ruled in
</EM><BR>
favor of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the defendant, Lopez, in deciding that the Gun-Free School Zones Act is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unconstitutional in its overly broad claim under the Commerce Clause. They
</EM><BR>
ruled
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that a person carrying a weapon on school grounds or within 1000 feet of
</EM><BR>
school
<BR>
<EM>&gt; grounds does not fit the definition of engaging in interstate commerce.
</EM><BR>
With
<BR>
<EM>&gt; this ruling, we have one more nail in the coffin of gun control.
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't uncork the champaigne too soon.  The general mood, as exhibited by
<BR>
polls, is still in favor of more gun control.  And that particular law was
<BR>
heinously stupid.  Why does crime X -- whether you agree X should be a crime
<BR>
or not -- suddenly become so much worse because it takes place near a
<BR>
school?  Imagine if all laws were like that.  You get caught driving with an
<BR>
overdue inspection sticker and you get a higher fine because you're within
<BR>
1K feet of a school.  Your dog barks at two a.m. and the judge increases the
<BR>
punishment because a high school is nearby.
<BR>
<P>I gather such laws arose either to overcome local opposition to the law or
<BR>
to make it look like politicians are being tough on crime.  I wonder if
<BR>
anyone has assessed their impact.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The fact this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; came so soon after the Million Mutha March (oops, make that the 100,000
</EM><BR>
mom
<BR>
<EM>&gt; march) indicates that the conservative block of Rhenquist, O'Connor,
</EM><BR>
Kennedy,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Scalia, and Thomas that steadily maintains the fundamental principle that
</EM><BR>
&quot;Every
<BR>
<EM>&gt; law enacted by Congress must be based on one or more of its powers
</EM><BR>
enumerated by
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the Constitution&quot;, will likely continue on this track when and if it hears
</EM><BR>
US v.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Emerson next year,
</EM><BR>
<P>I would not praise them too highly.  In several recent decisions, they
<BR>
expanded police powers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Assuming Bush gets elected, I forsee US. v. Emerson passing the Court with
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; devastating victory for gun owner rights and the 2nd Amendment.
</EM><BR>
<P>Assuming he gets elected...  But the problem is, a Conservative Court is no
<BR>
friend to freedom in general.  Surely, we might -- ah, might! -- get some
<BR>
gun control removed, but in other areas, such as police power, we might have
<BR>
more freedoms curtailed.
<BR>
<P>All power to the Libertariat!
