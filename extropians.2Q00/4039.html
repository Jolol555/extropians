Well, Daniel, (I know your comments were addressed to Nadia and not to me;
<BR>
please excuse me for butting in) when you said there was nothing wrong with
<BR>
stoking the fires of debate, it came across to me as though your main
<BR>
purpose in entering into the conversation was to manipulate the behavior of
<BR>
the other parties to the conversation.  It's like a put-down, like you're
<BR>
making fun of them for taking the issues seriously or something.  I could
<BR>
understand why Nadia felt like moving on to some other conversation.
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt;  Seriously, I figured some of you might want to read more on the book

and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  that comments might ensue.  I see nothing wrong with wanting to stoke

the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  fires of debate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Look,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I had known that this was only about a &quot;debate&quot; war to be stoked, I'd
</EM><BR>
<P>Must have used the wrong word.  I was unaware that Nadia assumed debates are
<BR>
wars that must be won or lost.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; never have taken the time to answer your questions about what the
</EM><BR>
standards
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of art education were. I thought you were intrerested in my knowledge, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now I find it's a one way street where you only want use debate tactics,
</EM><BR>
so
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you can -- win win win?
</EM><BR>
<P>I replied to her questions, agreeing with her on several points.  I see by
<BR>
her above answer that she has locked on to the word &quot;debate&quot; and is now
<BR>
closed to any further communication.  Guess, the myth of Nadia's open mind
<BR>
is finally shattered.  Didn't think my joking comment would be the one to do
<BR>
it.:/
