<P><EM>&gt; I've come to accept that some things can't be hurried, but by slowing the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tempo of my perceptions and expectations and carefully paying attention to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the small signs of slow change in the developing plants I husband, I've been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to tap into a reservoir of insight and calm I never knew before.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think astronomy can do this too, I take great enjoyment in tracing
<BR>
the progress of the moon through its phases, where the planets and my
<BR>
favorite constellations are from day to day. And of course the sun -
<BR>
right now the night is just four or five hours long, and since I often
<BR>
work at night I get the chance to see the light slowly change from
<BR>
sunset to blue twilight to summer night to dawn. Beautiful.
<BR>
<P>Of course, there is a kind of opposite aesthetic enjoyment, the quick
<BR>
flashes of enjoyment and understanding. This morning I was truly hyper
<BR>
after having spent the entire weekend working on yet another magnum
<BR>
opus (a transhumanist gastronomy text) and found that I had the
<BR>
attention span of a butterfly but found aesthetic pleasure in almost
<BR>
*everything* - the colors of the clear blue sky, the way trees move in
<BR>
the wind, the spring flowers, the ingenious gratings of air vents, the
<BR>
dynamics of traffic, the angles of buildings, the smells of people,
<BR>
the intricate mathematics of plant growth, the patterns of dirt on an
<BR>
ATM and everything else. Impossible to concentrate at anything, but
<BR>
everything was delightful. I felt like the protagonist in Egan's
<BR>
_Reasons to be Cheerful_. A very nice state but I think I wouldn't
<BR>
want to remain in it indefinitely. There is much to be said for
<BR>
stability.
