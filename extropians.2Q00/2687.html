&quot;Technotranscendence&quot; says:
<BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I prefer to look at Star Trek as an allegory in which the different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; characters are archetypes for aspects of humanity.  It is possible, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I think Robert Anton Wilson has suggested, to view the principal Star
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Trek characters as emblems of various aspects of consciousness, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Enterprise itself serving as one of them.  Leary's eightfold
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even if true, it's still stereotypical thinking.
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh?  No it isn't.  Allegory is not the same as stereotype.  It might
<BR>
be that literal reading of an allegorical figure sounds
<BR>
stereotypical.  Perhaps &quot;Star Trek&quot; viewers frequently do that.
<BR>
Perhaps the authors should have thought more carefully to avoid it.
<BR>
But if they meant the characters allegorically they did not set out to
<BR>
create stereotypes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I prefer characters that are more full, more realistic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, then, you would prefer more realistic and less allegorical
<BR>
stories.  My suggestion is that read as allegory, (think of myths,
<BR>
&quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot;, some parts of Tolkien, especially &quot;The
<BR>
Silmarillion&quot;) &quot;Star Trek&quot; can be more fun.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I still believe Eliezer right here -- the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligent (and the rational) are projected in a one-sided way.  The reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they split people into characters like that is because deep down, too many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accept the notion that reason and emotion are antagonistic and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I disagree.  I think the reason they split the characters into
<BR>
archetypes of particular modes of consciousness is to explore
<BR>
different ways of reacting and responding to complex problems.  Each
<BR>
character has a different facility for dealing with the unknown, and
<BR>
their interactions illustrate the way those facilities interact.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I also prefer &quot;the unknown&quot; that is a bit more unknown and a lot less like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finding more of the same in space.  (_Star Trek_'s alien races -- choose any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; series -- are a bit too much like humans from look to culture.  And the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things the crews discover range from cliche to platitude.:)
</EM><BR>
....
<BR>
<P>My assessment is that &quot;Star Trek&quot; is really largely allegorically
<BR>
about the confrontation of the unknown in typical human life *now*.
<BR>
In other words, it represents a plea for a humanist perspective, and
<BR>
an optimistic, flexible, open-minded attitude in response to typical
<BR>
interpersonal problems people actually confront.  So of course the
<BR>
allegorical figures would likely be similar to things on Earth.  &quot;Star
<BR>
Trek&quot; isn't really about the far reaches of the galaxy.  It's about
<BR>
our society, or rather the late '60's U.S.
<BR>
<P>All the best,
<BR>
James
