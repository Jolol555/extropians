<P><EM>    &gt;You only call these things &quot;the same  location&quot; because your resolution is
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;not accurate enough to detect that they  are inches apart.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I've already said if consciousness even has a location (and that's doubtful in
<BR>
most cases) it's where its sense data originated. There is no reason two very
<BR>
different brains (and I don't give a damn about brain location) could not receive
<BR>
identical sense data, hence two consciousness exist at the same place.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Where did you get the plan  for building a Harvey Newstrom?  From the original.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been making and destroying a billion Harvey Newstroms every second since
<BR>
you were a one celled zygote, so you tell me, who is the original Harvey Newstrom?
<BR>
<P>Yea yea, &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot;, but just calling it a trick is not good enough unless
<BR>
you can explain how the &quot;illusion&quot; works. You haven't done that.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Do you have another term you want to apply to the first copy besides &quot;original&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>Mythical.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;If you create a body and destroy it so fast that it doesn't have time to have a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;thought, then you have failed to recreate my consciousness in a copy.  You have
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;changed the definition of the copy from being a functional mind copy to a nonfunctional
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;body copy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not at all, the brain functions as well as ever, it's just that any single copy can't think
<BR>
much in 10^-9 seconds. And yet you think, you're conscious, something survives
<BR>
that is bigger and more important than any one copy.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;If the copy cannot think a single thought, then this is clearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; not the thought-synchronized copy you were discussing earlier.
</EM><BR>
<P>No they're synchronized, you can't think about much in 10^-9 seconds either.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;You're not going to claim that the Platonic god-form qualia of &quot;redness&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;is  co-existing in both fruit, are you?
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly not! I'd never say such a thing, a tomato is a vegetable not a fruit.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Is your whole claim of duplicates being a single object based on quantam
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;many-worlds, qualia, Platonic forms, mystic souls, or anything else that
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;can't be defined by atoms and energy?
</EM><BR>
<P>I do claim that some things are very real but are neither atoms nor energy, like
<BR>
redness or thought or 17 or consciousness or any adjective.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; I don't see where we disagree on any objective facts.
</EM><BR>
<P>We disagree on subjective facts, I think they can probably be deduced pretty
<BR>
well by studying objective facts,  you don't.
