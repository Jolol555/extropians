<EM>&gt; How do you suggest conflicts between two people with different providers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be solved?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think that's a problem - you retain the notion of fault, so if
<BR>
I get drunk and hit you I'm responsible for your damages. If I put you
<BR>
in hospital for 6 months my liability is huge, and therefore my
<BR>
insurers is too, since I'm required to carry some significant amount
<BR>
of coverage for injuries I may potentially cause other people. It's
<BR>
then in his interest to prevent me from driving like a maniac, even if
<BR>
I own a tank full of airbags.
<BR>
<P>In cases where fault is disputed, then our insurers can take each
<BR>
other to court - usually though you'd hope it could be solved by
<BR>
mediation, since both sides would want to save to cost of litigation.
