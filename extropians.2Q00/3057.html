<P>&lt;&lt; I will simply observe that I made a concrete suggestion
<BR>
&nbsp;about what *we* could all as individuals do to allow
<BR>
&nbsp;the recreation of &quot;beings&quot;, in the not too distant
<BR>
&nbsp;future, with reasonable probabilities of looking like former
<BR>
&nbsp;individuals whose mental and biomaterial had been preserved.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;This seems to have gone from A, to B, to Z, where Z
<BR>
&nbsp;represents the &quot;Wouldn't it be nice if we had some more
<BR>
&nbsp;magic physics so we can have everything we ever wanted.&quot; &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Interesting what one would consider 'magic physics' and what one considers 
<BR>
within the realm of coherent probability?  Many people, yes even scholars 
<BR>
educated in physics, astronomy, biology, and computer science; would, sadly, 
<BR>
be very scornful of this entire mailing list and the subjects that govern it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Perhaps some guidence might be in order for levels of acceptability on what 
<BR>
falls into the realm of reality and what is beyond the pale? Are multiple 
<BR>
universes magic physics or non-locality?
