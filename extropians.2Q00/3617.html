<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Formally, I have the right to a good education, but in a tax-free,

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; service-free system, I may not have the effective freedom to have it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; But by removing some of one of my freedoms (the right to choose how I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; spend my money), one of my other rights is protected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You have the right to educate yourself, or to buy an education. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could volunteer to participate in the public school system, but forcing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; others who choose to send their kids to private school to also pay taxes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to support you sending your kids to school is criminal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Erm, no. You may happen to think it's *wrong*, but it's not criminal. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact, it's currently criminal for them *not* to.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Please get your terms right.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, its what is called a 'taking' here. The government cannot confiscate
<BR>
your property without compensating you for it at fair market value, so
<BR>
technically they cannot tax you without giving you something of equal value at
<BR>
market rates in exchange for it. If you don't receive a government funded
<BR>
education, then the funds they took for that purpose are an unconstitutional
<BR>
taking.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; You are only gaining your education by stealing from others. At least be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; honest about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, terms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's not stealing if those people have agreed to pay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which, technically, they have. By remaining in the country, and by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upholding the government and its taxation policies.
</EM><BR>
<P>So if we don't agree to write a blank check, with no itemized receipt for
<BR>
services rendered we should get out? I don't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You've stated before on that thread that you think people should accept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they have agreed to the government they have allowed to hold power.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is nothing in the Constitution, federal or state (at least for NH) that
<BR>
says anyone is entitled to an education. That the SCOTUS' opinion of
<BR>
congressional legislation is that they are limited to those areas enumerated by
<BR>
the Constitution, then they really don't have any say in the matter. Unlike
<BR>
some, I do beleive we should live by the limitations of the Constitution.
