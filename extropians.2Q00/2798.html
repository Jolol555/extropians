<EM>&gt; &gt; The UN will not and cannot be representative of &quot;the planet&quot;.  It

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1: that &quot;it doesn't even&quot; is a telling point.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2: isn't that why the US elects a govt?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>If I am not mistaken, the U.N. representative for the U.S. is an appointed
<BR>
position; in other words, they represent the interests of whoever
<BR>
appointed them, not of the country in general.  Fortunately, some U.N.
<BR>
associated issues require congressional ratification.
<BR>
<P>Despite the influence of the U.S. in the UN, I think many Americans view
<BR>
it as more of a European institution than an American one.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Have you considered how many people would have to die to get to that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;comfortable&quot; stage?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nope! How many?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Have you considered how many people will die via any other method you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; care to think of?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Most of the biggest slaughters of humankind in history have been the
<BR>
result of such political and social normalization.  Expecting that this
<BR>
time around will be any different is dubious at best.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The titanic wars between nation-states have bodycounts that are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dwarfed by the bodycounts inside nation-states caused by ill-run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; governments.   
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I really really really doubt that.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Check your history. 
<BR>
<P>Here are some 20th century statistics for you.  These figures only include
<BR>
the largest incidents, as the myriad of smaller ones do not significantly
<BR>
impact the totals:
<BR>
<P>Domestic state-sponsored killings:  50-55 million dead
<BR>
WW1 + WW2 total killed:  40-45 million dead
<BR>
<P>These figures combined encompass about 10 events, approximately half of
<BR>
which occured in the &quot;civilized&quot; first world.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; And I think you'll find that there would be a small minority of states
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which would account for most of the deaths, as opposed to a world war
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where the deaths are spread all over the place.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And I still fail to see your point.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>Does it really matter if the deaths occur in one place or all over?  Fact
<BR>
is, in the last hundred years just about every government on the planet,
<BR>
including most of the &quot;civilized&quot; European nations have been responsible
<BR>
for at least one significant mass killing of populations under their rule.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; I think it is quite plausible that those &quot;titanic wars&quot; *reduced* the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; total bodycount.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Looking at it from a long-term perspective, sure.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Does anything else matter?  Two killed every day of the week is better than
<BR>
five killed every Monday?  This is the same kind of argument used by
<BR>
people who think it is horrible when a plane crashes but don't care that
<BR>
far more people die in automobile accidents.  Situational and
<BR>
historical myopia.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; And WWII did more to bring us closer to a single world govt than any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other single thing you can name.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>WW2 didn't bring us any closer to a single world government.  The primary
<BR>
result was to undo the political stupidity that resulted from WW1.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; It's six of one, half dozen of another. Ideally, I'd like to see the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world broken up into tribal city-states, anarcho-collectives, etc., but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's just me.   But, I think a single world govt would result in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far more peaceful world than the one we have now.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The more decentralization the better.  City-states would be better than
<BR>
what we have now.  In fact, modern technology could alleviate many of the
<BR>
old problems that surrounded this type of sovereignty.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a matter of opinion whether or not people's &quot;liberty&quot; would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infringed, but your liberties tend to be torpedoed in a war zone, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what the hell.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Wars are usually started by governments.  Most wars are between
<BR>
governments and their own people.  This does nothing to support your case.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Hey, dude, can you drag your mind out of this weird &quot;governments exist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only to kill you&quot; mindset, as I'm just not interested in discussing an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issue I consider patently mindless?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Don't mark yourself a nitwit by denying the implications created by the
<BR>
very definition of government.  This has nothing to do with paranoid
<BR>
ranting.  If your premises can't be questioned, the rationality of your
<BR>
position falls into question.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; And besides: what on earth makes you think such a govt would have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; death penalty, given that most nations don't?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>You must be talking about official death penalties as opposed to the
<BR>
unofficial ones that just about every government in the world uses.  There
<BR>
are many western governments with no death penalty that routinely and
<BR>
intentionally kill their own citizens, and in a manner far more insidious
<BR>
than simply having a judicial death penalty.
<BR>
<P>I know for a fact that U.S. covert op people were helping European
<BR>
governments kill undesirables within their own countries during the '80s,
<BR>
including ones with &quot;no death penalty&quot;.  I have friends who
<BR>
killed dozens of European citizens under the command of (and
<BR>
working with) European government agencies.  (The people I know who did
<BR>
this eventually left the military as a result of these experiences; one
<BR>
became a total pacifist.  By their own accounts, many people were killed
<BR>
for no apparent reason.)  I know of a few other, similar types of
<BR>
situations, and most are uglier than this particular historical footnote.
<BR>
<P>You forget that Disneyland is the way it is because all the ugly stuff is
<BR>
actively hidden.  Conservation of Evil seems to be an axiom for
<BR>
governments.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; And wouldn't it be a GOOD thing if the really bad guys had nowhere to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>And who defines &quot;bad guys&quot;?  Oh yeah, the same people who want to
<BR>
imprison/kill the &quot;bad guys&quot;.
