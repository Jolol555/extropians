<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Question: I've been making and destroying a billion Harvey Newstroms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; every second since you were a one celled zygote, so you tell me, who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; is the original Harvey Newstrom?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; For what definition of &quot;original&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You tell me, it's not my term, Harvey is the one who thinks it's cosmically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important, I think it's nonsense.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, then: an &quot;original&quot; is that instance of a thing which existed at the
<BR>
point in time at which the process of &quot;copying&quot; commenced, where &quot;copying&quot;
<BR>
is understood as the process of creating another instance of a thing that
<BR>
shares as many properties with the existing thing as physically possible.
<BR>
Note that this definition of &quot;original&quot; requires an act of copying to be
<BR>
meaningful--no act of copying, no &quot;original&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;For what definition of &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Harvey Newstrom needs no such definition, he has something much much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better, an example. Definitions are seldom important in life and certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not in this case.
</EM><BR>
<P>But he doesn't have an example (although his subjective impression of
<BR>
the continuity if his consciousness might lead him to mistakenly believe
<BR>
that he can point to a single lump of atoms as an example), but you've
<BR>
just told him that you are in the act of creating copies at will and
<BR>
destroying them--so now he knows that by the time he points to a lump
<BR>
of atoms, there may be a different lump of them in the same place.  Let's
<BR>
say you're flipping a coin after each copying act to decide which one to
<BR>
destroy. In that case, you are destroying half a billion &quot;originals&quot; per
<BR>
second, and there is no single thing to point to.  At each interval, the
<BR>
then-existing object evolves its state in some way that depends upon the
<BR>
state of all the previous Harvey-like things that have occupied the space
<BR>
of your experiment, giving the impression of a continuity--a process--that
<BR>
one might choose to identify and name, say, &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot;.  If that
<BR>
is the name of this process, then your question is meaningless, because
<BR>
we haven't defined &quot;original&quot; or &quot;act of copying&quot; in terms of processes.
<BR>
If the name attaches to the thing, then the question is underspecified:
<BR>
you must ask which is the original with respect to a particular act of
<BR>
copying.
<BR>
<P>We could, if you wanted, define &quot;process-copying&quot; a as the act of
<BR>
thing-copying a thing that manifests the process.  We then have two
<BR>
things behaving in similar ways, and must now decide whether the name
<BR>
of a process applies to the class of processes or to each particular
<BR>
instance of that process running on different things.  If &quot;Harvey
<BR>
Newstrom&quot; is the name of an instance of a process, then that instance
<BR>
which was being manifested in the &quot;thing-original&quot; lump of atoms whose
<BR>
thing-copying predicated the process-copying, then it makes sense to
<BR>
call that the &quot;process-original&quot; Harvey.  These too, then, only apply
<BR>
to a single act of process-copying; if you do billions of them, you
<BR>
will have billions of originals.
<BR>
<P>We could of course define these things in other ways and get entirely
<BR>
different answers.  But I still don't see any real question here worth
<BR>
answering.
