<P>&lt;&lt; Yes, and there were artillery shells developed for 4 and 8 inch guns that 
<BR>
were
<BR>
&nbsp;nuke capable. Once the gummint had a better idea of what lingering radiation
<BR>
&nbsp;could do, many of those were retired and dismantled. Some were kept in europe
<BR>
&nbsp;for helping to winnow down the 20 to 1 odds against us in armor capability 
<BR>
the
<BR>
&nbsp;Warsaw Pact had if they tried to take western europe. So far as I know, many 
<BR>
or
<BR>
&nbsp;most are no longer in service. Those still in storage are kept at places like
<BR>
&nbsp;Dugway which are VERY secure. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Not to change the subject, but I believe that the technology was also 
<BR>
developed by Defense Department scientist, Ted Taylor, as a component for 
<BR>
Freeman Dyson's Orion Spacecraft, affectionately known as Bang Bang.  Orion 
<BR>
would've produced a lot of nuclear 'fallout' as it passed through the 
<BR>
atmosphere on its way to the moon. Nuclear Concussions against a pusher plate 
<BR>
seem fairly wasteful, but fast. It may somehow be used someday in solar 
<BR>
system travel-but not to orbit!
