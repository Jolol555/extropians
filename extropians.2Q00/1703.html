Being a fav subject of mine, I would also suggest that the Jupiter Brain 
<BR>
emmulation concept, conjectured by Roboticist, Hans Moravec is also in the 
<BR>
works, as it utilizes  
<BR>
a neutron star as the the source of computation. I believe the bit-stream for 
<BR>
such a emmulation of the entire earth history is well bellow the estimated 
<BR>
10^60 bits per second that a small neutron star is supposed to be capable of. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Another extreme is the Max Tegmark Ensamble of Universes, and that deserves 
<BR>
its own mailing list-which surprisingly there is.

&nbsp;Tipler's notion is completely additive: if other immortality bids fail,
<BR>
&nbsp;his idea might still somehow come thru for us.  I estimate cryonics
<BR>
&nbsp;gives you about a 10% chance of resurrection, Tipler adds another
<BR>
&nbsp;1% or so, Singularity deciding it likes you: 5%, nanotech/uploading
<BR>
&nbsp;about 20%, all other notions including traditional religion, negligible.
<BR>
&nbsp;So the good news is we have better than a one in three chance of
<BR>
&nbsp;indefinite survival, and yes I acknowledge the possiblity I am fooling
<BR>
&nbsp;myself.  {8^D  spike

&nbsp;Mike:
<BR>
&nbsp;Those are not really such bad odds -- whether you are fooling yourself or
<BR>
&nbsp;not! IMHO, it really boils down to a version of Pascal's Wager (i.e., I
<BR>
&nbsp;paraphrase: &quot;If God does not exist and I believe in him, I lose nothing; if
<BR>
&nbsp;God exists and I do not believe in him, I lose the chance for eternal life.
<BR>
&nbsp;Ergo, believing is the best bet.&quot; This presumes, of course, that God
<BR>
&nbsp;requires your belief before he'll resurrect you.) By this reasoning, our
<BR>
&nbsp;best gaming strategy is to pursue any and every chance at life extension
<BR>
&nbsp;and/or immortality that does not exact unacceptable costs in the present.
<BR>
&nbsp;(Unfortunately for some, the price of a cryonics contract is still
<BR>
&nbsp;unacceptably high right now.)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding a Tiplerian resurrection/emulation, Anders Sandberg has pointed
<BR>
&nbsp;out that, short of Tipler's Omega Point, a similar resurrection/emulation
<BR>
&nbsp;could be possible via AI superobjects (Jupiter/neutron star size/density AI
<BR>
&nbsp;brains) albeit for a less than universal coverage of the deceased. (How do
<BR>
&nbsp;we get on the resurrection/emulation waiting list? Maybe this Extropians
<BR>
&nbsp;list is IT!)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point in time, I'd rate Anders' idea as the more likely of the
<BR>
&nbsp;two.
<BR>
