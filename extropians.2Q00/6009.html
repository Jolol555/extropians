<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20followers/leaders%20(was%20You%20may%20not%20believe%20in%20God%20but%20She%20still%20believes%20...&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGKECMFHAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>

<EM>&gt; &gt;  What is the difference between a tribal leader and a political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leader, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  respect to personality?  I'm assuming here that a tribal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leader does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  force to get people to follow her but is followed voluntarily,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and only so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  long as her leadership is beneficialy to the other members of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the tribe.  A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  political leader, by definition, uses coercion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bonnie, with respect, this sounds like you're laboring under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yoke of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Meadeian anthropology of &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot; (which was just a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientistic restatement of Rousseau's fantasy of the &quot;noble savage&quot;).  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't know of any real empirical basis for this view of primitive social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organization and leadership.  For instance, the Yanomamo of the Amazon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jungle, once thought to be the very epitome of the &quot;noble
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; savage&quot;, have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found to have a fairly violent culture, full of bloody power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; struggles, war
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and casual rape.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I never read &quot;Coming of Age in Somoa.&quot;  I heard that everything in it was
<BR>
questionable, since when the Somoan girls were being interviewed, they made
<BR>
up a bunch of stuff as a joke (but they didn't let Meade in on the joke).
<BR>
<P>I was categorizing more along the lines used by Jared Diamond in...what was
<BR>
that book called?..._Guns, Germs, and Steel_ or something like that...with
<BR>
tribal cultures defined as those in which leaders are chosen for specific
<BR>
purposes and continue to lead only so long as the people agree to have them
<BR>
lead; in such cases the leaders are unlikely to enjoy special material
<BR>
advantages. The definition refers to political powers and says nothing about
<BR>
the level of violence practiced by individual people in the course of day to
<BR>
day life, although in kinship based tribes violence is more likely to be
<BR>
turned against non-members than members. This is in contrast to, say, a
<BR>
chiefdom or a kingdom, where the leader continues to lead even when a
<BR>
substantial number of members of the group are against his or her
<BR>
leadership; in chiefdoms, the leader enjoys material advantages such as
<BR>
fancier clothing, nicer housing, special foods.
