<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not wrong just on the simple fact that psychoactive drug induced
</EM><BR>
states of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness are directly correlated with neurotransmitter activity
</EM><BR>
within the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; neuron itself to say nothing of the larger neural network pattern.  That
</EM><BR>
alone
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is proof that there is *extra* computation taking place within the neuron.
</EM><BR>
<P>It proves nothing even remotely relevant to the argument.
<BR>
<P>If we know that some particular set of neurons performs a certain function,
<BR>
and we know we can duplicate said function with X MFLOPS, we have an
<BR>
accurate estimate of the computational demands of replacing said neurons.
<BR>
Period.
<BR>
<P>It doesn't matter whether the neurons do computations using chemistry,
<BR>
quantum mechanics, or black magic. It doesn't matter how complex their
<BR>
internal states are. It doesn't even matter if we have any clue how they
<BR>
actually work. The fact that we can replicate their effects on the external
<BR>
world with X MFLOPS is the only thing that matters.
<BR>
<P>If you want to argue against estimates based on this method, you need to
<BR>
show that the sample tissue does less computation than an equivalent volume
<BR>
of neurons from other regions of the brain, or that it does computations
<BR>
that are somehow easier to duplicate on a computer than those of the rest of
<BR>
the brain, or that the sample is somehow atypical in some other respect.
<BR>
<P>Going on about how complex the individual neurons would be to simulate in
<BR>
detail isn't relevant. Once you've got an empirical measurement of the
<BR>
amount of computation that they do, the question of how the work actually
<BR>
gets done becomes academic.
