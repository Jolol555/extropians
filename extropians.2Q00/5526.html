<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but I think I know enough to make a relatively firm decision on the point,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even with my layman's understanding of the science and technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>Greg, I'll take the &quot;layman's understanding&quot; and chew on it a bit
<BR>
(because all those people believing in the resurection are &quot;laypersons&quot;
<BR>
as well... :-)).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 1.  The mind is a function of the material operation of the brain.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, though you have to jump up and down on Penrose with spiked heels
<BR>
to get that through to people.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2.  Identity persists through highly varied states of brain functioning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (although identity may be effected significantly by those changes in brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; states).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and given that many people wake up beside people who clearly have
<BR>
a different identity (or mental state) than the person they went to sleep
<BR>
beside the night before, this begs the issue of what cryonics reanimations
<BR>
will &quot;wake up&quot; as.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3.  Freezing with good cryoprotectants can preserve at least some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; informational content of a dead or dying brain.  Information preservation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will get better as cryopreservation techniques improve.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
I'm coming more and more to believe that the cryoprotectant issue is a noop.
<BR>
Fundamentally it comes down to the computer power you have to put the pieces
<BR>
back together and whether the pieces *largely* have the information content
<BR>
of the brain before freezing.  Freeze a piece of meat (w/o cryoprotectants)
<BR>
and you still get back a piece of meat when you thaw it out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4.  Technology is advancing on a broad front such that &quot;reading&quot; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information content of a cryopreserved brain will be more and more complete
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and precise.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.  But there is clearly a threshold of &quot;readability&quot; that must be reached.
<BR>
Below that and cryonics is useless.  Above that and the marginal benefits
<BR>
are probably small.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 5.  Not cryopreserving your brain will result in a near-complete loss of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information content in a relatively short period of time.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;near-complete&quot;??  Unless you are a Tiplerian, the loss is so close to complete
<BR>
that it *is* complete.  However, there may be leftovers unrelated to your brain
<BR>
(e.g. Sasha's memoirs) that allow the reconstitution of a relative approximation
<BR>
of individuals.  Now, there are going to be a lot of people with raised eyebrows
<BR>
if a combination of genetic backtracking, historic pattern matching and
<BR>
simulation integration with known outcomes allows you to by and large recreate
<BR>
an individual without any frozen wet-matter at all!  How much of the &quot;Greg&quot; personality
<BR>
could I get knowing the time and place of years of the crystallization of your
<BR>
firmware?
<BR>
<P>IMO, you can throw away the rest of the arguments and simply stick with #5.
<BR>
Even a 0.000001 % chance of survival is better than the 10^-??? chance
<BR>
allowed by dependence on &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;belief&quot;.  The cost is minimal relative
<BR>
to the potential benefit.
<BR>
