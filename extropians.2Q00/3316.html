<EM>&gt; Funny thing about these &quot;culturally neutral&quot; tests, is that you get better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at them the more of them you do. It gets easier to spot patterns in the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the questions are formulated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, powers of 2, pascal and fibbonacci sequences, come on. That's got to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be heavily culturally biased. Or maybe people who don't know the powers of 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by sight are thickies?
</EM><BR>
<P>A better choice would have been powers of 7, which is far less likely to
<BR>
pick up a familiarity bias.
<BR>
<P>I would expect that many computer programmers and some types of engineers
<BR>
would not only recognize powers of 2, but could do arbitrary manipulations
<BR>
of them in their sleep; I also would not expect the average person to
<BR>
catch on as quickly.  This is especially true for programmers that use
<BR>
languages that require you to be familiar with the hardware.  I certainly
<BR>
know that I can effortlessly and naturally manipulate integers in base
<BR>
16/10/2 that are binary encoded whether their representation is in
<BR>
decimal, hex, or binary, largely as a result of doing C programming for
<BR>
many years.  Recognizing the power set of a given base is pretty
<BR>
fundamental to manipulating numbers in that base.  
<BR>
<P>I suspect that any symbolic manipulation will be subject to the biases
<BR>
that result from culture specific activities that do cognitively similar
<BR>
manipulations.  I do think it is possible to create a nearly bias-free
<BR>
symbolic test, but it would probably require a lot of research to do well.
