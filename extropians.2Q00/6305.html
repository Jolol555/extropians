Robin writes, quoting Greg:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Actually, I think the e-commerce cost-recoupment idea is also impractical.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It seems like &quot;window dressing&quot; for the core idea of making a modular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;power/water/net/clinic unit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then data I mentioned on the ineffectiveness of water/clinics is relevant.
</EM><BR>
<P>Earlier Robin wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Comparisons across poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countries, regions, and individuals almost never show any substantial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; health effect of variations in medical spending or water and sanitation.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the problem here is that this result is so surprising, so
<BR>
unintuitive, that it is hard for people to believe it, or at least to
<BR>
fully internalize the belief and build on it.
<BR>
<P>We are accustomed to paradoxical results these days.  You can find
<BR>
thousands of web pages explaining why simultaneity varies between moving
<BR>
observers, or how something can be a particle and a wave at the same time.
<BR>
<P>But where can you find an explanation of why giving people clean water
<BR>
and good health care for the first time won't improve their health?
<BR>
It flies in the face of intuition just as much as those physics phenomena,
<BR>
and is really far more relevant to our daily lives.
<BR>
<P>You do occasionally see explanations of other paradoxes with an economic
<BR>
flavor: adding airbags to cars won't necessarily improve highway safety
<BR>
(because people will increase the riskiness of their driving, knowing
<BR>
they have additional protection); increasing the minimum wage won't
<BR>
necessarily give more money to the poor (because some people won't be
<BR>
able to get jobs at the higher wage).
<BR>
<P>Maybe the economic profession could improve their communication to the lay
<BR>
community by writing more about these paradoxical results.  (Or perhaps
<BR>
this has been done, in which case I'd like to know where to look...)
