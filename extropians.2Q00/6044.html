<EM>&gt;&gt; The best defense against this is to make sure the mainstream of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; discussion is held in a polite and understandable manner, to create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; clear principles that can help people understand that the extremist is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; just that, and overall try to gain a good reputation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Anders, *you have* a good reputation, and I am honored to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;associated with you.  I dont recall ever seeing an unkind word from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you or even a micoflame, even against those who richly deserve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it.  {8-]  However there are posters to this list that I hope I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;never associated with, (and they surely feel likewise about me)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and I have no control over what they post.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There are many cases where we quote a previous post then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;refute that stated viewpoint.  Any debate opponent doing a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;keyword search would get hits with someone else's quote with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;our name on it.  If they wanted, they could delete out our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;comment and quote someone elses words under our name.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think Anders has crystallized the direction of behavior is an aptly
<BR>
positive light, but it's often easier to write down the words than to deal
<BR>
head on with an adverse poster.  If Anders had to defend his reputation,
<BR>
how would he do it?  For example, if Anders was told something very
<BR>
unbecoming about himself or his family, I don't even want to imagine, but
<BR>
something that could humiliate or hurt him professionally, would he
<BR>
continue politely to respond when the flamer wouldn't let up.  Or, would he
<BR>
walk away knowing that he did the best he could under the circumstances,
<BR>
and better judgment told him to ignore the flamer.  I would never want
<BR>
Anders to experience such a thing, but it does build character -:)
<BR>
<P>I suppose it depends on how curt the flames are, how public the forum is,
<BR>
and how other people in the forum are dealing with it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I dont know how to deal with deniability of archived posts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other than to request a complete version of any quoted post
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and a request to confirm my authorship.    spike
</EM><BR>
<P>This is great idea for self-protection.  But how many times do we write
<BR>
something and don't think to save it, or have no idea how it might be used?
<BR>
&nbsp;Hopefully not too often.
<BR>
<P>I think that Bonnie touched on important issues also:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&quot;What are the bad things that could happen if the Extropians didn't have a
<BR>
good reputation?  With whom must they try to maintain a good reputation?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Last night I was at a life extension summit and we were talking about all
<BR>
the recent PR in the news about biotech, nano and cryonics, etc.  Someone,
<BR>
maybe me since I have a thang for culture, will write about the people
<BR>
behind the ideas.  Robert Freitas (_NanoMedicine_) is a really cryo guy, as
<BR>
is Michael West (formerly with Geron) and others on this list, etc.  The
<BR>
point being, there are so many interesting people in &quot;our&quot; culture and it
<BR>
is becoming more and more mainstream.  Since our ideas are disturbing to
<BR>
many people, it's best to present them in ways that are not threatening.
<BR>
Thus, a good reputation is beneficial.  Maintaining a good reputation with
<BR>
each other (first), and then with the public would mean those who are our
<BR>
colleagues, those who we do business with us, and those who interview us in
<BR>
the media.
