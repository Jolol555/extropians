<P><EM>&gt; I then asked around among the people I know who are law 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  buffs, and they were all aware in considerably more detail, it seemed, of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the same material, although some of them probably fit the categories you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  indicated, for sure.  But then, Hitler liked dogs...
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't mean to suggest that the text hadn't at one time been considered as 
<BR>
an amendment to the Constitution, but rather that the interpretation seemed 
<BR>
far-fetched.  In the context of the period between the two wars with Britain, 
<BR>
it seems perfectly understandable.

<P><EM>&gt; Keep in mind Greg, that at that point in history, there had been the big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  anti-mason reactions IIRC. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, with respect, so?  Holding a title within an organization (such as the 
<BR>
masons) couldn't be the target of the proposed text, since &quot;President&quot; and 
<BR>
&quot;Congressman&quot; would also have been outlawed in such a case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Frankly I wouldn't mind if there were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  anti-trust actions taken against the bar.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I wrote before, I'm deeply ambivalent about the state sanctioning of the 
<BR>
bar.  On the other hand, as Zero Powers (Austin's little brother?) pointed 
<BR>
out, there's plenty of competition among lawyers (don't I know it!).  There's 
<BR>
certainly little or no price effect, as law schools compete like hell for 
<BR>
entrants and there's been plenty of downward pressure on legal fee rates 
<BR>
these last ten years.  I can assure you that there's no collusion to support 
<BR>
prices.  Poor people may well be underserved by the bar, but I don't know 
<BR>
that allowing anyone to hold themselves out as a lawyer would cure that.

<P><EM>&gt; One other thing weirds people over here out about the US; it's the 
</EM><BR>
assumption
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  that natural rights exist. But that's another matter. (In general, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  are two concepts of rights. One is that 'nature' somehow assigns certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rights to human beings, and those rights exist almost in a platonic sense;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  they're real things and you can't abolish or add to them. Another 
</EM><BR>
philosophy
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  of rights is that rights are an emergent phenomenon, that comes from people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  behaving towards each other as they themselves would like to be dealt with;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  your right to life is the corollary of my refraining from killing you. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  view of rights is that they're all essentially social constructs, and while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  they're desirable and necessary they're in no way automatic.)
</EM><BR>
<P>My (emerging and evolving) view of rights might be seen as a third 
<BR>
alternative, synthesized from these two.  I don't see rights as having some 
<BR>
platonic or supernatural &quot;reality&quot;, but I think they are by no means 
<BR>
arbitrary social constructs and therefore may well be seen to be &quot;automatic&quot; 
<BR>
in the sense you seem to use the word above.  In my view, rights ARE an 
<BR>
emergent phenomenon, but they are inherent in the fabric of social 
<BR>
interaction.  Thus certain fundamental principles of liberty and autonomy, as 
<BR>
well as some aspects of &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;transparency&quot; are aspects of any 
<BR>
creative and satisfying social order.  It's obviously possible to create 
<BR>
human social orders which thwart these rights, just as its possible to design 
<BR>
and build an engine that has high friction and low energy efficiency.  But a 
<BR>
study of society will INEVITABLY lead to such a high valuation of liberty, 
<BR>
individual autonomy, fairness and transparency that we will come to value 
<BR>
them as &quot;rights&quot;, just as a study of mechanics will cause us to value low 
<BR>
friction and energy efficiency as fundamental design values.
