I thought some list members might like this story I picked up on a work
<BR>
mailing list
<BR>
<P><P>According to The Straits Times of Singapore, NIIT, an information
<BR>
technology (IT) training institute in New Delhi, resides a few yards away
<BR>
from a slum. As an experiment, NIIT's cognitive engineering researchers last
<BR>
year made
<BR>
a hole in their office wall facing the slum and installed a powerful
<BR>
computer
<BR>
connected permanently to the Internet. The computer was available for anyone
<BR>
to
<BR>
use. It's just sitting there, apparently out in the open, on the street.
<BR>
<P>The result was extraordinary. The slum children, many of whom had had no
<BR>
primary school education, went over to check out the computer. There was
<BR>
no instructor on call; they were left to themselves. Within hours they were
<BR>
successfully finding websites on the Internet (Disney, Hindi films,
<BR>
cricket trivia) and learning other computing skills as well (not just
<BR>
Internet related).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Since nobody taught them &quot;correct&quot; computer terminology, they made up
<BR>
their own language. For instance, they call websites &quot;channels,&quot; and the
<BR>
mouse
<BR>
&quot;needle&quot; because of its &quot;sharp&quot; pointer.To date, the children have created
<BR>
more
<BR>
than 1,000 folders and used the computer for everything from games to
<BR>
helping their parents.
<BR>
<P>The article also provides some analysis of the implications for poverty
<BR>
stricken children, worldwide.
<BR>
