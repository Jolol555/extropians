<EM>&gt; &gt; The foreign consortium
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; was not operating a business as far as Australia is concerned, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gambling.  I believe at the time the U.S. tax code did not require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Australians who place bets on U.S. lotteries to pay capital gains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; taxes to the U.S., but rather to pay them to their home country (at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; least from what I recall in the Time or Newsweek article).  Of course
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Australia had no capital gains tax on gambling winnings.

<EM>&gt; This is weird.  Is this recent?  I know an Australian guy who was in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consortium several years ago to do just this, with the aim of eventually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starting a sovereign country with the proceeds (last I heard they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in negotiations with the Govt of Vanuatu or some other Pacific nation)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but the guy who put it all together skipped with the cash, and they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still trying to get it back.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This was about 95 or so I think.

<BR>
<P>I recall reading an article after in Newsweek or Time about this
<BR>
particular consortium after they scored their first big win in a
<BR>
U.S. state.  (I vaguely recall Tennessee).  I believe this was early
<BR>
'90's, maybe shortly after the gulf war.  Anyway, there was much
<BR>
speculation that the U.S. would move to close loopholes which taxed
<BR>
foreigners less on lottery winnings in the U.S. than it taxed
<BR>
U.S. citizens.
<BR>
<P>As Mr. Lorrey points out, this could still be a good deal in certain
<BR>
cases, because paying only U.S. capital gains taxes and no other tax
<BR>
to any other entity can still be a relatively good deal on a high
<BR>
E.V. lottery, and those do turn up with some frequency in the U.S.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I don't recall any further details.
<BR>
