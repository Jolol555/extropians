<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;If it ever becomes possible, I would do exactly that, in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;heartbeat. I want to figure out what it is ladies see in us ugly old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;boys. {8^D spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Really? You would try being a woman for a day?
</EM><BR>
<P>This exact topic came up before, but I may have some new insights.
<BR>
When I said about a year ago that I wanted to find out what it was
<BR>
like to be a woman, several posters suggested I dress up in women's
<BR>
clothes, but that misses the point.  I already *know* how I would
<BR>
feel in womens clothing.  I would feel silly.  Doubt it would be very
<BR>
insightful at all.  What I want is a pair of glasses that let me see the
<BR>
world
<BR>
from a womans view.  I want a pair of headphones with a switch
<BR>
that can translate ordinary sounds into the sounds that men hear, and
<BR>
another switch that translates that same sound into what women hear.
<BR>
<P>Then I wouldnt just look like some crazy goof in a dress.  I would look like
<BR>
<P>some crazy goof with a computer on his head with goggles and earphones.
<BR>
Saying things like Edith Bunker:   ooohh...oooooooooooohhhhhhhhh...
<BR>
<P>I already know I have a hard time mapping my own feelings and
<BR>
emotions on those of normal people.  I need to make a special
<BR>
effort to do that which comes natural to others.  So what I am
<BR>
suggesting is a brain prosthetic of sorts, that operates on the
<BR>
emotions.  It would be kinda like having a wooden leg, only it
<BR>
would be a wooden head.  I would want to see, hear and feel
<BR>
the world not only from a woman's point of view, but also a gay
<BR>
man's.  And a lesbian's for that matter.  [Actually, I think I already
<BR>
do on that one.]
<BR>
<P>It was suggested that taking certain hormones might do the
<BR>
trick, but I am kinda chicken on that one.  I was a teenager in
<BR>
the 70s and never did drugs.  I still think the mechanical route is
<BR>
the way to go.
<BR>
<P>I want Eliezer or one of his collegues to someday derive a map
<BR>
of the brain function, that can explain all the imponderables, a
<BR>
diagram, where he can point to it and say, &quot;See, here is what a
<BR>
normal brain looks like, and this other diagram is you.&quot;  I hope
<BR>
I live to see those kind of developments.  spike
