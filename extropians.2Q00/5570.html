<EM>&gt;However, this not being the case, what then is an agnostic?

<P>Huxley describes how he came to originate the term 'agnostic' as follows:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/sn-huxley.html">http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/sn-huxley.html</A>
<BR>
When I reached intellectual maturity, and began to ask myself whether I was an
<BR>
atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; a Christian or
<BR>
a freethinker, I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was
<BR>
the answer; until at last I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor
<BR>
part with any of these denominations, except the last. The one thing in which
<BR>
most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from
<BR>
them. They were quite sure that they had attained a certain &quot;gnosis&quot; -- had more
<BR>
or less successfully solved the problem of existence; while I was quite sure I
<BR>
had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble. And,
<BR>
with Hume and Kant on my side, I could not think myself presumptuous in holding
<BR>
fast by that opinion. [...]
<BR>
<P>So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of
<BR>
&quot;agnostic&quot;. It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the &quot;gnostic&quot; of
<BR>
Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I
<BR>
was ignorant; and I took the earliest opportunity of parading it at our Society,
<BR>
to show that I, too, had a tail, like the other foxes.

My definition of agnostic is probably different from any that you have
<BR>
previously heard. My (modern) definition is that everyone is an agnostic. That's
<BR>
right, everyone is either an agnostic/atheist or they are an agnostic/theist
<BR>
because no one can 'know' god. Atheists probably don't have a problem with this
<BR>
definition, but I'd be willing to bet that many theists who are reading this
<BR>
don't appreciate being labeled an agnostic.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
