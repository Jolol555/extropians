<P><EM>&gt; This means any random thing you write is archived for posterity (or at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a teime) Anyone can access it and use it -  any random assine blurtings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be pulled up by keywords and quoted in major publications - without your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permission. it has happened to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ive an idea.  We could take our extropian archives, download all
<BR>
our own posts, write a script that randomly removes sentences from
<BR>
each, scramble the order of the sentences and recombine the scrambled
<BR>
sentences to create new nonsensical posts therefrom, post these to
<BR>
the list.  The new nonsense posts would show up on every
<BR>
keyword search, which would foil those looking for quotes from you.
<BR>
We could do the same on the paragraph level.  Ideally, someone could
<BR>
figure out a way to do this without wrecking the archives.  We could
<BR>
quickly identify and eliminate the fabricated posts by some sort of
<BR>
password system, such as a little quiz that every extropian would know
<BR>
but few outsiders would know, such as:
<BR>
<P>1)  What is the name of the prominent young theorist
<BR>
whose sig line is yours in the singularity?
<BR>
2)  What is the acronym mnemonic that once applied to the
<BR>
extropian principles?
<BR>
3)  What is the middle name of the wife of More?
<BR>
<P>etc.  Knowing these answers would automatically filter the archives,
<BR>
otherwise, tons of garbage.  What say ye?  spike
