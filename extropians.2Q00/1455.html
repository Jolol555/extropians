<EM>&gt; (Amara Graps:   just learned that 1 nautical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mile = 1852 meters, more strange units for us astronomers!)

<P><EM>&gt;Oh damn!  So that's why I got the bends the last time I dived with my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;metric-thinking British friends?  A meter IS ten feet, right?  I mean,
</EM><BR>
that's
<BR>
<EM>&gt;why they call it the metric system, right?

<P>Ok now now you guys get to see why we 'muricans lose space

probes.  {8-[

<P>Just a couple comments on units please.   The nautical mile is the
<BR>
one non-metic unit that kinda makes sense.  It is one arc minute
<BR>
at the equator.  Since you know that originally the meter was
<BR>
proposed as one 10 millionth the distance from the pole to the
<BR>
equator, take 1E7 then divide by 5400 minutes in a quarter of
<BR>
a circle and you get 1852 meters per arc minute or nautical mile.
<BR>
If you want to estimate your latitude, this is a handy bit of wisdom.
<BR>
memorize the latitude of your favorite state line or landmark,
<BR>
then you just estimate the distance north or south and you know
<BR>
a nautical mile is a little over a statute mile or almost 2 km, so
<BR>
a degree of latitude is close enough to 70 miles or about 110 km,
<BR>
and so you can impress your friends by accurately estimating your
<BR>
latitude that way.
<BR>
<P>Secondly, those of you who know we lost a Mars probe by a
<BR>
little metric/english units goof, the final outcome of that was this:
<BR>
the Lockheed Martin engineers were exonerated, for they delivered
<BR>
exactly what they had contracted to deliver.  It was NASAs
<BR>
responsibility to convert the units, by contract.  It was done
<BR>
incorrectly, so we all lose.  {8-[  spike
