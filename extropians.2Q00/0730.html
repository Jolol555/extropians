<EM>&gt; &gt; Literally by your intepretation, yes, however the US has never brought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; an anti-trust suit against a foreign company. Considering the weight of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; corporate systems like the keiretsu, etc. as monopolistic enterprises,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Out of curiosity, have any of the keiretsu ever achieved a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; position in the USA?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I understand it, anti-trust law is applied within a nation-state by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that nation-state's government, with respect to the market within that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state's jurisdiction. A company can be nailed in a specific country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under anti-trust statutes even if it is based elsewhere -- but its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; external headquarters is probably immune to direct action; all it loses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is access to that market, or a hefty fine and/or regulation if it wants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to continue trading there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>My point exactly, but you and Zero seem to think that some european
<BR>
court is gonna issue an arrest warrant to the FFL to apprehend Bill
<BR>
Gates from his pad in Medina and that the US Gov't is just gonna sit
<BR>
idly by and let this shit go on.
<BR>
<P>The keiretsu acheived some 35% control of the US auto market at one
<BR>
point, but at the same time they acheived control of almost 60% of the
<BR>
auto parts market. Their underpricing of autoparts caused a lot of
<BR>
businesses to go out of businesses (not quite the same as giving away a
<BR>
browser for free, but close).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fail to see how the Justice department could tolerate a foreign national
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government monopoly bringing anti-trust action against a US corp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It would be anti-trust action against a US corp for monopolistic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activities in that nation's own jurisdiction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (especially in light of how nice we have been to the French with their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; desire to retain monopoly on the words 'Champagne' and 'Burgundy' for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their particular trade items that have been quite well duplicated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; elsewhere.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ahem: Champagne and Burgundy are _regions_ of France. Their produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is appelation controlee, meaning it's graded by quality. This is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some extent a hold-over from the agricultural age, and you'll note the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tendency to name modern wines by the grape they're produced from -- which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't a controlled designation.
</EM><BR>
<P>If someone in California makes wine that is indistinguishable from
<BR>
champagne to a panel of tasters in a double blind test, it is champagne,
<BR>
and they should be free to call it that. Accepting the claims of the
<BR>
French for 'cultural heritage', when that 'heritage' is nothing more
<BR>
than a desire to maintain their elite attitude as being the 'superior
<BR>
culture' of the planet is ludicrous.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I seem to recall a bit of give and take in this whole argument (which in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any case is neither yours nor mine, but a governmental wrangle); for example,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anheur-Busch are still allowed to call their product &quot;Budweiser&quot; in most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parts of Europe (although in the Czech republic and Switzerland &quot;Budweiser&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is an apellation controlee and AB's product isn't brewed in the right way or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the right place to carry the name &quot;Budweiser&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<P>Frankly I side with the Czechs. Budweiser (american) sucks. It would do
<BR>
us good to make them produce their products to a quality standard (any
<BR>
quality standard, just name one...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If the French were so keen on developing a 'viable' competition, why did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they not develop a Frogosoft corporation to compete with MS, as they did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to form Airbus to compete with Boeing (interesting Seattle parallel)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ahem. How much of Airbus is government owned? I seem to recall some rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large shareholders that are private companies, like British Aerospace ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess you're just sore because Airbus is outselling Boeing 60/40 at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; present, without the hidden subsidy of military R&amp;D contracts  ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>So the government subsidy of the workers benefits packages isn't a
<BR>
subsidy????
