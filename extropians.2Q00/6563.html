<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;Watched a TV program the other night on the efforts by cleaning and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;maintenance staff in Silicon Valley to earn enough to cope with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;explosion in rents and other prices in the area. The poor buggers seemed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;be working as hard as humanly possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;if they had value of themselves and their well being, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;willingness to rationally figure out how to attain goals which would make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;them happy, and then to actually ACT on the results, then they would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;more money and more happiness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dazzling! Then the Oracle offices would never get cleaned, the lavatories
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would stink, and all the geniuses in Silicon Valley would die of some vile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gastric lurgy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The simplest thing to do would be to move to someplace with lower rent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Another answer is to get a new job.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You're not paying attention here, buddy. Really. I'm talking about people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who seem mostly to be migrants, who are doing the traditional heartbreaking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; migrant thing of investing their own miserable lives working their arses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off doing the scutwork so their kids can go to school and get training for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those better jobs. (Which might not be there in another couple of decades,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of course.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Move to somewhere with a lower rent. In the Valley. I love it. They're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already in garages and subdividing their tiny apartments. Be serious.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's perhaps easier to think this through by looking at the area's school
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teachers. They don't get paid enough to rent decent houses in such an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inflated bubble world. Yeah, they could and maybe should move out, en
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; masse. Let the cyber zillionaires send their kids to computer kindergarten.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh, but it's the *market*, it's the *market*...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes exactly. They get what they settle for. Simple as that. No whining
<BR>
allowed. If you ain't happy then do something to make yourself happy or
<BR>
don't. I don't care. I can tell you this- if the teachers all moved out
<BR>
of the valley the people there would have no trouble raising the $$$
<BR>
required to start up their own private schools. Who gives a #### about
<BR>
public schools anyway? I'm sorry but I get tired of people whining about
<BR>
their own self-induced problems that they refuse to do anything about.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Will you tell me a bit about censorship in Australia?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Each Australian has an allocated Censor, who attends every movie with you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and covers your eyes or ears during the disturbing bits. The level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disturbance allowed to you has been established by E-meter at puberty. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Censors themselves are protected against moral danger by a committee of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; priests, ministers, rabbis and mullahs.
</EM><BR>
<P>LOL :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ahem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, I don't know - I don't earn enough to get to the movies much. For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some reason, neither American nor Aussie publishers are buying young adult
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science fiction at the moment, so I'm going to need to hit the net with my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuff and bypass the oligopolies. It's all Harry Potter right now and no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money left for much else, since fiction is marketed in the same way as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toothpaste and toilet paper. Makes sense, it's the *market*, it's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wonderful wisdom of the *market*... No, of course that's grossly unfair,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since as everyone here knows, what links the producer and the consumer in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the West *isn't* `the free market', it's a bottleneck of corrupt little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pishers (to use Courtney Love's nice recent phrase).
</EM><BR>
<P>Or it could be that mostly people only want to buy the Harry Potter stuff.
<BR>
Someone asked me the other day- why is it that the top 40 music is always
<BR>
sooo lame, no matter what decade you are in? Obviously this is because
<BR>
the majority of the people out there (think of a Bell curve here) _like_
<BR>
that music. Hard to believe, but yes it is true. So if you wanna get rich
<BR>
you are going to have to lower yourself to that level, or else charge a
<BR>
boatload of $$$ to the few people who want to buy your good stuff. Of
<BR>
course soon all media will be pirated in digital form so you are going to
<BR>
likely be SOL anyway. Consider a career change or find a wealthy patron.
