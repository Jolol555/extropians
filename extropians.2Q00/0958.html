The previous wasn't 119 years old, but, Jeanne Louise Calment who lived to
<BR>
be 122 until her death in 97. <A HREF="http://www.wowzone.com/calment.htm">http://www.wowzone.com/calment.htm</A>
<BR>
Sarah (Clark) Knauss lived to be 119 and died in 1999, perhaps they state
<BR>
this chronologically.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sunday April 16,2000 edition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By Mark Fineman Los Angeles Times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Portsmouth, dominica - At first glance, there doesn't appear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be much left of Elizabeth Israel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Her leathered and furrowed skin sags from a frail 90-pound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frame. She hasn't walked in a couple of years and went blind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in November. From time to time, her sentences trail off.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     But as she greeted a visitor in her simple plywood shack on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a recent afternoon, her handshake was firm. Her elegant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appearance confirmed what her friends and neighbours say:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; She insists that her hair and her earrings be just so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Through her neighbours, she reminisced in her native Cocoy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dialect about what a &quot;wicked boy&quot; that Adolf Hitler was, about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how rocky her only marriage was - coming so late in life, in 1925
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - and about the three grandsons she has outlived.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     All in all, not bad for a women who, according to church records
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; turned 125 in January.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     In fact, Dominicans beleieve Israel is the world's oldest person.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     This nation's Roman Catholic archdiocese issued an official
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; baptismal certificate just in time for Israel's birthday, declaring that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; she was born Jan. 27,1875. The document confirms an entry a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neighbour unearthed in December in a tattered church registry,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which recorded Israel's baptism on Jan 30 of that year.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Based on that certificate, Israel's friends have submitted her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; name for inclusion in the next edition of the Guiness Book of World
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Records, which will be out in October. And since Sarah Knauss,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the record holder listed in the lastest edition, died Dec 30 at age
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 119 in Allentown, Pa., Israel appears to have a good shot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     The story of Israel, known to all her neighbours as Ma Pampo,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goes beyond record books. It is a tale of roots, human endurance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the lessons that such a long life can teach.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     The daughter of a freed slave, Israel worked on a lime and coconut
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plantation for about 90 years for pennies a day. She retired about 21
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years ago and lives penniless in a blue clapboard shack. yet she is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blessed by the love and charity of her neighbours.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     By way of perspective, in the year the records show Ma Pampo was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; born, Ulysses Grant was president of the United States and Queen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Victoria was on the British throne. The following year, Alexander
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Graham Bell invented the telephone - a device Ma Pampo never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has owned.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     She has survived two world wars, the island's sometimes violent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; struggle for independence, a coup and countless uprisings,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although her clearest memory is of explosions from offshore naval
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; battles during World War II.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &quot;She's a no-nonsense women,&quot; said Dominican broadcaster Alexander
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bruno. &quot;She's aware of everything. She smiles. She laughs. She tells me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything she's heard on the radio.... She knows who she voted for last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; month. She knows she's 125.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
