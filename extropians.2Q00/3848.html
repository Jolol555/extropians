<EM>&gt; &gt; It was quite evident that nanotech is gaining steam. Technanogy sponsored

<EM>&gt; &gt; the event, they are a nanotech incubator backed by Ted Waitt (of Gateway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; computers). Their first project is &quot;nano aluminum&quot;, which in its first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; application is the creation of super high thrust solid rocket fuel. Think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; single stage to orbit at $50 to 100 a pound. But for starters they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; working on refitting stingers and other conventional weapons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nanopowdered aluminum is not all that remarkable- there's a product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called AlEx or some such which is nanoscale aluminum powder made by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exploding a wire with a capacitor discharge in a helium atmosphere.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has a slightly positive heat of formation relative to bulk Al, but solid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fuels are inherently a poor match for orbital launch- you get better Isp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and effective bulk density out of liquid fuels, and for SSTO or even a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cheap TSTO, delta-V is most important.  Solids are great for tactical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propulsion (ie missiles) but just can't compete with liquids for system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bulk density, mass fraction, and Isp.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is something I've wondered. If liquid fuel is so much better, why
<BR>
does the shuttle, the Delta, the Araine, the Titan, etc all need solid
<BR>
boosters to get decent enough mass fractions to put decent payloads in
<BR>
orbit? I was wondering if people were biased toward hydrogen merely for
<BR>
purists sake. Sure you get great Isp, but you get great Isp from an ion
<BR>
engine too, and you wouldn't want to power a launch system with an ion
<BR>
engine.
