<EM>&gt;  &gt;I LOVED your post.  It echoes something I've come to appreciate in the 
</EM><BR>
last
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;couple of years, especially the last few months; that is that consciously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;cultivating behavior aimed at a SLOWER pace has substantial benefits in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;aspects of my life.  In particular, I've come to appreciate working in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;garden around our house as I never had before.

<EM>&gt;  This sounds an awful lot like you are just changing as you get older.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Evolution has programmed humans to express different genes at different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ages, which changes both obvious things about our bodies and less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  obvious things about our minds.  We are in many ways just different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  people when we get older, with different abilities and preferences.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  People seem to talk all the time about how they &quot;discovered&quot; things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  about what they liked at certain crucial ages, whereas it seems much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  more likely to me that they just changed.  Thing of how differently sex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is to you at age 18 versus age 10.  This isn't because you learned new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  insights at age 15, it is because hormones were expressed that literally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  made you a different person.  Well changes in hormones don't stop at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  age 18, they continue all the way through life.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure there's a large element of truth in what you've written, Robin.  
<BR>
Until we gain a greater measure of control over our wetware, success and 
<BR>
happiness in life will largely be measured by how well we master and use the 
<BR>
tools dealt us by our current over-all state of being, which will be at least 
<BR>
to some extent beyond our control.  Thus, when I was young and had what seem 
<BR>
to me now to be amazingly quick reflexes, I enjoyed driving a motorcycle at 
<BR>
speeds that would surely be suicidal for me now.  Mastery over the 
<BR>
seasonal-scale progression of biological systems in my garden, on the other 
<BR>
hand, would have been quite beyond my competence in those faster days.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;
