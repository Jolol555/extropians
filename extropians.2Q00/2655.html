<P><EM> &gt; Yes, I see that you want full access to all parts of your consciousness,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and that one consciousness stream does not have full access to the other.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The problem here is that you're not quite playing my game.  Under my
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; definition, you DO have access to every part of yourself, and you DO think
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to yourself that &quot;I think therefore I am.&quot;  &quot;You,&quot; under my definition, DO
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; have access to every consciousness stream that is you, DESPITE the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that some of your parts aren't aware of the others, because &quot;you&quot; are the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; set containing ALL of the consciousness streams.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are now redefining the word self to mean multiple, disconnected
<BR>
entities.  This does not preserve my concept of self.  This merely requires
<BR>
me to restate my goals using the new terms.  Instead of making my &quot;self&quot;
<BR>
immortal, I now need to state that I want to make those portions of my
<BR>
&quot;self&quot; that I can access immortal, and ignore those portions of my &quot;self&quot;
<BR>
that I cannot access.  Any system that deletes the portions of the &quot;self&quot;
<BR>
that I can access and only saves those portions of the &quot;self&quot; that I cannot
<BR>
access deprives me access to my &quot;self&quot; which is exactly what I want to
<BR>
avoid.
<BR>
<P>You haven't explained how my goals are acheived with your system.  You have
<BR>
merely relabelled your system to use the terms that I use.  (Freedom is
<BR>
slavery!)  My goals are still incompatible with your system.  If you
<BR>
redefine the terms, I will just have to restate my goals using different
<BR>
terms again.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; You're right.  You're not too keen on preserving &quot;self&quot; as such.  My
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; error.  Instead, you're interested in avoiding your own &quot;death,&quot; whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; THAT turns out to be.  My argument can be fully restated in terms of you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; being mistaken about what &quot;death&quot; is rather than being mistaken about the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;self.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>You are merely relabelling things to use the labels I want.  This still
<BR>
doesn't provide the functionality that I desire.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &lt;blink blink&gt; Are you going to try to argue with me that you would have
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; little familiarity with an *exact copy of yourself*???
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, this was a tangent.  Discussing dying for a friend or brother or copy
<BR>
is not the same as believing you are the same person and can discard the old
<BR>
body.  I don't think this part of the discussion was useful.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; As for not being willing to die for a copy who WANTED to *replace* you, if
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; my &quot;copy&quot; turned out like that, I'd be quite skeptical that it was really
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; a copy after all.  Don't forget that your copy would have all the same
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; motivations as you, and all the concern for you that you would have for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; him.  (Yes, that includes not being willing to die for you if you wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; be willing to die for him.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  I assume my copy would not want to die even if I lived on.  He
<BR>
would want his own life.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Why did you decide to make an ending consciousness stream death?  I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; understand why you want to avoid death.  By why did you decide to make
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; THAT death?  More to the point, why not make it &quot;having an empty copy set&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; instead?
</EM><BR>
<P>That is my definition of death.  But let me try to be clear:  I do not want
<BR>
to avoid death.  I want to avoid having my current consciousness stream end.
<BR>
If that is not death, than I don't mind death.  For example, I don't mind
<BR>
dying, being cryogenically frozen, and then reanimated.  Maybe I died, but
<BR>
my consciousness stream still continued.
