<EM>&gt; (As an ignorant and provincial Aussie, I'm simply flabbergasted by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rumour I hear that in order to vote in the USA, citizens are required first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to *register* with *one of the parties*, although apparently they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allowed to change their vote once inside the booth [and even write in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; candidate's name, a cool choice not offered here]... Can this be true? The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind genuinely boggles.)
</EM><BR>
<P>In most states you must be a registered member of a political party to
<BR>
vote in the *primary* election where that party's candidate is selected.
<BR>
The justification is that Republicans should choose the Republican
<BR>
candidate, not members of other parties.  Some states have been going to
<BR>
a more open primary policy, however.
<BR>
<P>In the general election, in the fall, when the actual political offices
<BR>
are filled, anyone can vote, you don't have to be registered for any
<BR>
party, and you can of course vote for any candidate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Equally boggling to an outsider might be *our* laws penalising those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *don't* turn up at the polling booth. You're not obliged to vote, just to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take your pieces of paper, have your name signed off, and put them--checked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  or otherwise--into the boxes. I rather like this practice, actually. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you're going to have the pretence of free and universal representative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government, you might as well powerfully encourage everyone to confront the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choices on offer. Those who oppose compulsion can pay the fine, after all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a sort of market solution.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is amazing, that the government has the right to force people to
<BR>
vote, or at least to pretend to vote.
