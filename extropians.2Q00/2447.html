<EM>&gt;This is the basis of the old DoD Tempest requirements that government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;secured vaults be lead-lined and have no external cables of any kind for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;power or data.  A simple truck body does not meet the requirements for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Tempest shielding.

<EM>&gt;The ability to read computer screens and keystrokes via radiowaves has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around for decades.  It is very easy to do, also.  Keystrokes produce tiny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;radio bursts when the electrical connection is made.  Each key is slightly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different and has its own fingerprint.  Capturing these and displaying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;keystrokes in order is easy.  After that, simple code-breaking will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;determine which fingerprint matches which key.  For example, in English, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;letter &quot;e&quot; is most common.  The most used key is the space bar, followed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the most used letter &quot;e&quot;, etc.  The longer you monitor, the more exactly the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;frequency table will converge with standard statistical tables.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>Seems to me that simply running two or more computers in close proximity 
<BR>
will produce enough hash, especially if all the computers are of the same 
<BR>
make and model, as to obscure the signals from any particular one. It would 
<BR>
not be difficult to arrange some mechanism to &quot;type&quot; on the decoy units - 
<BR>
say, have one PC type out War and Peace on the other, while your typing on 
<BR>
a third machine is obscured.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;From my reading on Van Eck, the real information was not from the 
<BR>
keyboard, but from the monitor. The scan rates of the targeted computer are 
<BR>
replicated in the phreaker's monitor, and a sensitive receiver picks up the 
<BR>
RF coming from the screen itself, and uses this as a video signal. You lose 
<BR>
any color information, of course, but high contrast such as black text on 
<BR>
white background can be seen. Since LCD monitors use a different scanning 
<BR>
technique, they would be much less susceptible to this kind of attack.
<BR>
<P>I recall reading about special fonts specifically designed to provide a 
<BR>
&quot;fuzzy&quot; edge to Van Eck, while remaining easily readable to humans. I wish 
<BR>
I remember where that article was - it's been a few years.
