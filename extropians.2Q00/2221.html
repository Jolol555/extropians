<EM>&gt; On the one hand, you'd think there might be situations where a system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emulating its own substrate could actually yield a speed increase. For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instance, take a chip running a instruction-level simulation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself. To elaborate on your example, let's say multiplication on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chip is very inefficient: it takes longer to multiple 5 by 6 than it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does to do 5 adds. If I simulate multiplication by doing additions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then I'd get a speed increase.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But this is a one time optimization: If the emulator runs another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; layer of simulation, I won't get the same increase. And I only get a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speed up on programs using the multiplication instruction - so I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a faster chip, that is a chip that runs every program faster than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the substrate, I only have a chip than runs a subset of programs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faster. You always have to bottom out somewhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's an analogy here to data compression: There exists no algorithm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which can be guaranteed to shave a bit off any arbitrary bit string. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there were, applying the algorithm enough times would compress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything down to zero. All you can do is map frequently occurring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patterns down to short encodings at the expense of making less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frequent patterns more expensive to express.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem with compression, which is why simulations cannot accurately
<BR>
reflect a real reality, is that compression loses detail. Its lossy.
<BR>
Granted there are some ways to compress data that simply a more
<BR>
efficient method of organizing information or in the example above,
<BR>
using one fast method to simulate another method that actually runs
<BR>
slower, however at some point, you've optimized organizing and
<BR>
methodology to its most concise point, anything beyond that and you have
<BR>
to destroy actual data, for example, JPG images.
