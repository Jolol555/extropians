</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I see a lot of people pointing optimistically to some of the roadkill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the way to the fantasy of being able to hum and hear trumpets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's almost all roadkill.  It'll happen eventually, but it will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the result of using on the order of four different &quot;pitch-guessing&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processes, and voting.  And to get that to work will require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recognizing the instrument used as input.  This is, after all, what a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human does.  Our auditory processing is truely remarkable.  The real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reason that we haven't solved this problem is that the goal has a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;large fantasy element--it couldn't be made to work even using magic,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unless you somehow hacked the user's perceptions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Assuming that you can build hardware that somehow does discriminate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pitch as fast as we do, you have the latency issue that you are now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ready to start playing the note that the human audience has already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;heard from the source (whistle, guitar-string or whatever) and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;start late.  You just can't make this work in real time performance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;situations, even if you can hide the original control signal from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;audience.  The control signal matched the timing of the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;performers, but the resulting tone is unavoidably late.  Playing solo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doesn't solve it either because what you are hearing is the note that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you were humming, played as trumpets, not the one that you are trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to hum right now.   The actual note-rate (tempo) that can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accomplished is really slow.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'd love to see a real solution, but I don't think you can get there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even with use of EEG.

In the '80's there was a product called &quot;pitch-rider&quot; for the Amiga that 
<BR>
alleged to do just what you say is impossible.  I saw some impressive 
<BR>
demonstrations, with guys humming or whistling and having it come out as 
<BR>
MIDI guitar chords, or organ chords.  One guy who actually claims to have 
<BR>
the product, however, did say that it wasn't really that accurate in real 
<BR>
time - those guys must have practiced a LOT.  I would have liked to have had 
<BR>
it just for sequencing, however.
