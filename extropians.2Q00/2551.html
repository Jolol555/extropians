<EM>&gt; I happen to be willing to &quot;die&quot; (or whatever) so long as a pretty recent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copy of me lives on.  (By pretty recent, I mean on the order of months,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe a year under extreme circumstances.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why would a person be willing to do that?  Well, it's because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continued existence of this consciousness stream is not an intrinsic end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of mine.
</EM><BR>
<P>IMO the only relevant question is whether minds which adopt this position
<BR>
will come to outnumber those which are more conservative about letting
<BR>
themselves die under such circumstances.
<BR>
<P>The real reason we don't want to die is because our ancestors who feared
<BR>
death tended to survive better than those who didn't.  However dying
<BR>
in such a way as to leave enough genetic copies (as a bee who dies for
<BR>
a hive, or the mother cat dying to defend her chickens) was generally
<BR>
positive for genetic survival.  We aren't descendants of bees, so we don't
<BR>
think much of their ideas, but dying to defend children or relatives is
<BR>
a trait admired by most people.
<BR>
<P>If direct mental reproduction becomes possible, then dying in such a way
<BR>
as to save near-copies of the mind will probably be a rewarded trait.
<BR>
It will come to dominate morality, whether we like it or not.
