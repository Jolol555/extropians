<BR>
<EM>&gt; There has never in the history of humanity been a nation which allows its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizens as many freedoms as ours.
</EM><BR>
<P>That was true a century ago. Since then, most of those freedoms have been
<BR>
eroded to vestigial status, and many have vanished entirely.
<BR>
<P>First Amendment protections are stronger than ever, and the extension of
<BR>
full citizenship and equality before the law to women and minorities was a
<BR>
dramatic improvement. But, scanning the bill of rights, I can find only one
<BR>
provision that is not blatantly ignored on such a routine basis that most
<BR>
people don't even notice anymore. The sole exception - the provision
<BR>
forbidding the quartering of soldiers in private homes without
<BR>
compensation - is observed more because of its irrelevance to the modern
<BR>
world that out of any respect for constitutional principles.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There has similarly never been a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government which is as accountable to the populace as ours is.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes there has. Representative governments are nothing new, Zero - they go
<BR>
back at least two thousand years, maybe more. There have been hundreds of
<BR>
states where the people could vote their rulers out of office, and thousands
<BR>
more where rulership was a tribal matter based on the consent of the
<BR>
governed.
<BR>
<P>In fact, by vesting so much power in unelected bureaucrats hidden within
<BR>
vast government agencies, we have actually achieved a situation where the
<BR>
people have far less control over what their government does than was
<BR>
usually the case in early republics.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There has never before been a nation in which the press has had an
</EM><BR>
absolutely
<BR>
<EM>&gt; unfettered right to criticize the government.
</EM><BR>
<P>The First Amendment is in much better shape than the others, but &quot;absolutely
<BR>
unfettered&quot; is still overstating the case. Unless you are a reporter, you
<BR>
can be prosecuted for your speech if it involves classified information,
<BR>
slander, or emotional statements that could be construed as threats. Since
<BR>
the government gets to decide what 'classified', 'slanderous' and 'threat'
<BR>
mean, that is a bigger limitation than it might seem at first. You can also
<BR>
be punished in other ways (for example, the IRS used to have a habit of
<BR>
auditing anyone who criticized them too openly), and as long as the agency
<BR>
involved isn't unusually incompetent there isn't much you can do about it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There has never before been a populace which has been as well educated and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; informed as we are now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Except, of course, for all the other developed countries that regularly beat
<BR>
us on comparisons of scholastic achievement. And lets not forget that
<BR>
educational standards in America declined considerably between 1900 and
<BR>
2000, so the comparison with our own history isn't all that great either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There has never been a time where the average citizen could reach as wide
</EM><BR>
an
<BR>
<EM>&gt; audience as any member of the media or the goverment until now.
</EM><BR>
<P>And that ability is purely the result of technology, has nothing to do with
<BR>
our government or society, and is also available to the citizens of every
<BR>
other Western country and much of the Far East.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I mean come on!  In light of the recent thread regarding politeness, I
</EM><BR>
will
<BR>
<EM>&gt; guard my words as much as possible.  I am *not* calling anyone here
</EM><BR>
stupid.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; But, it seems to me that to believe that America of 2000 a.d. could
</EM><BR>
somehow
<BR>
<EM>&gt; suddenly devolve &quot;very easily&quot; into a totalitarian state is..., well...,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; um..., way, way, very much less than reasonable?
</EM><BR>
<P>Reading your history tends to undermine such feelings of security.
<BR>
Representative governments seem to have a natural tendency to mutate into
<BR>
autocracies over time, and the only sure defense against tyranny is a
<BR>
populace that cherishes its freedom and will fight to defend it. If you
<BR>
don't have that, all the legal protections in the universe will ultimately
<BR>
prove useless.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, most American's aren't even willing to vote for freedom, much
<BR>
less fight for it. We are fortunate in that there is little chance of the
<BR>
kind of external crisis that strongmen usually take advantage of to seize
<BR>
power, but that won't protect us forever. If the trend of the last hundred
<BR>
years continues the end result will be some variety of police state, and we
<BR>
are only a few decades from the end point of that curve.
<BR>
<P>The renaissance of classical liberalism might prove strong enough to turn
<BR>
back the tide. Future technologies will change the political landscape in
<BR>
unpredictable ways, and may act either to undermine the state or to make the
<BR>
whole issue moot. But the outcome of the struggle is far from certain at
<BR>
this point.
