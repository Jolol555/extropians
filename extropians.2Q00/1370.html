<EM>&gt; &gt; The so-called 'radical' transhumanism is no longer radically futurist -
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is just a philosophical wing of big business and the political
</EM><BR>
mainstream.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is an interesting accusation.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think accusation may be a strong word.  I do agree with Steve that a lot
<BR>
of the &quot;futuristic&quot; stuff we discuss around here is old hat.  I have been on
<BR>
the Internet for decades.  Only Microsoft users think the Internet was
<BR>
invented in the 90's by Bill Gates.  My old Apple IIe had a voice
<BR>
synthesizer and a voice input command interface (from Beagle Bros.?) back in
<BR>
the '70s.  I was programming my home computers from Apple, Radio Shack,
<BR>
Commodore, Atari, etc. a decade before IBM &quot;invented&quot; the PC.  In college, I
<BR>
studying biochemistry, which included gene sequencing and cloning
<BR>
techniques.  The idea of robotics and uploading was actually being discussed
<BR>
back in the '70 by real engineering students.  In science fiction, it was
<BR>
old hat and very common to read about.
<BR>
<P>I don't want to belittle the progress we have made.  Things are definitely
<BR>
advancing.  But I do get tired of hearing how &quot;ultra-modern&quot; we are.  When I
<BR>
was a kid, I assumed that I could get a job on the Moon or Mars by the time
<BR>
I reached middle management.  I assumed that with modern medicine, I would
<BR>
live long enough to see the &quot;Star Trek&quot; era of the future.  In many ways, we
<BR>
aren't advancing as fast as we had predicted.  Most new innovations are not
<BR>
very original.
<BR>
<P>I know these ideas seem new and radical for many youngsters.  But for a lot
<BR>
of us old-timers, we are finally seeing the rest of the world catch up to
<BR>
what we have been dreaming since before many list members were born.  Now
<BR>
that we are all dreaming similar dreams, how do we turn them into reality?
<BR>
I don't want to wait another 40 years for people to start talking about
<BR>
these &quot;new&quot; ideas and trying to turn them into reality.
