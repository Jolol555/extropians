<EM>&gt; &gt;The design philosophy in America evolved in the late 19th or early 20th
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;century to the engineering maxim that &quot;we can build anything for a dollar 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;pound.&quot;  It is worthwhile to compare the Amiga OS, which originated in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Britain as TRIPOS, a real-time industrial control mini-computer OS, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;LINUX, or Gasse's BeOS, with the American products - MS/DOS, Windows,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;MacOS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  With design and forethought, the Amiga OS could easilly run rings 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Windows or the Mac at the same clock speed, yet it was much easier to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;more stable, and a tiny fraction of the size.  (Imagine being able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;format
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;not one, but several floppies, simultaneously, while running five or six
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;applications and communicating online with no noticeable slowdown, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;able to switch tasks in 1/60th of a second, reliably.  The Amiga was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that in 1990.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Then look at the absolutely unbelievable bugs and stupidity of Windows,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;can't even recall from one instant to the next what kind of view you want 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;icons, list, details, big icons.  It's a random draw - except when 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;willy-nilly decides to default to some view permanently - which happens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;And the errors were carried forward from Win'95 to '98!  If someone had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;told
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;me that such an atrocity was going to be the dominant OS of the year 2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;1980, I would have thought they were insane.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've mentioned this before but I had an Amiga once....two of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually...the original and then the Amiga2000.  Some years passed and THEN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;i was introduced to MicroSloth....I was shocked!!  Shocked I say!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Disgustingly primitive and hard to use by comparison
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How come this happened?   How did the bad overcome the good?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Were not talking politics here (are we?) but engineering and software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;design.

The A-2000 was nice for its time, but a real clunker compared to the A-3000, 
<BR>
which was the real pinnacle of Amiga hardware, with 9 co-processors.  The 
<BR>
A-4000 was supposed to be its successor, but by then Commodore was really 
<BR>
falling apart internally, and the engineers will tell you that some major 
<BR>
compromises happened due to cost-cutting, although an A-4000 with a 
<BR>
68060/Power PC combo board really flies.
<BR>
<P>Nostalgia aside, the history of the Amiga is one of the all-time great tales 
<BR>
of the forces of genius, integrity, community and creativity directly pitted 
<BR>
against the worst aspects of dog-eat-dog sleazoid klepto-finance-capitalism. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember the competition saying things like &quot;who needs 
<BR>
multi-tasking?&quot;  &quot;Who needs 4096 colors?&quot;  Who needs 32-bit addressing.&quot;  
<BR>
&quot;Who needs stereo high-fidelity digital sound?&quot;  Etc., etc.
<BR>
<P>It will be interesting to see if the new Amiga system, which is a software 
<BR>
virtual machine, not hardware - after Gateway suddenly pulled the plug on 
<BR>
the super 3D-HD-DVD Amiga they had designed in San Diego last year (right 
<BR>
before Gateway switched from AMD to Intel; no connection of course)- will be 
<BR>
allowed to succeed.  It doesn't directly threaten any of the &quot;powers.&quot;
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, the fact that it works with everything - all the OS's - 
<BR>
and appears to speed up operations betweeen 500 to 1000 percent might make 
<BR>
for a nasty food fight over who can grab it and monopolize it.  Sun and Red 
<BR>
Hat together may have enough clout to stave off any such moves, especially 
<BR>
with MicroSoft potentially crippled, or at least weakened, but I've seen so 
<BR>
many great products smashed or &quot;disappeared.&quot;
