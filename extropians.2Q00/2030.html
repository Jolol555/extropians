<EM>&gt; Well, at least you would be giving plenty of 29 year old women an excuse
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; never age....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The extra day and a quarter could be kept as Memory Leakage Day, and would
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; belong to a month. Of course, you could make Memory Leakage Day equivalent
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; February 10th, since I already own that day (in Lowell, Massachusetts, Feb
</EM><BR>
10th
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is Michael Scott Lorrey Day).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
If you are going to have a Memory Leakage Day (every day for me I'm afraid),
<BR>
then there could be 1 and a quarter the first year, sure. But then the
<BR>
earth's orbit would expand due to some mass fluctuation property of the sun
<BR>
(of which we had previously been unaware), and we'd have two memory leakage
<BR>
days the next year, then three, then four, five, ten, twenty, and soon the
<BR>
calendar would be rendered entirely useless (not to mention the icy death in
<BR>
the void the rest of us).
<BR>
<P>An important life lesson is to never put yourself in a situation where the
<BR>
worst thing which can happen next would also be the most ironic; it is then
<BR>
naturally bound to occur.
<BR>

Like if my computer crashed righf$d #$#2.....
