<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Emlyn (pentacle)&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:pentacle@enternet.com.au?Subject=Re:%20Teleworking;%20teletransportation&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000417054009.70957.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">pentacle@enternet.com.au</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;Zero:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Seems a little strange to me too.  For my money I'd much rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; teleconference.  For me, the only reason to face-to-face with clients is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enhance interpersonal relationships (its hard to buy somebody a drink 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;via
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; teleconference link).  That goal would hardly be helped by sending a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stranger wearing a cell phone ear-plug and a VR headset.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I find teleconferences are a really poor medium for interpersonal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;communication, especially if it involves building trust, and such things as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;initial brainstorming sessions, design, stuff where the parties involved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;need to make something up from nothing/not much, and do not as yet share a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cohesive vision regarding whatever it is that they are embarking on. Also,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doing job interviews by teleconference is really, really awful.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Personally I think the robots would do better, but as has been said, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technology isn't quite up to it. That said, remember that this is not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;robot which must work on its own; it has a dedicated human pulling the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;strings, so the job of control is simplified immensely. Not, I think, down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the level where it is actually currently practical, but perhaps close.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Most important I think is high speed wireless communications. The same kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of links that will make net-connected wearable computing work might also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make the remote robot body a possibility.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well now you're talking a whole 'nother (as yet unfeasible) ball game.  I'd 
<BR>
be all in for a telepresence robot that would feed its &quot;sensations&quot; to me 
<BR>
and relay my thoughts/actions to a remote location.  At that point I can 
<BR>
hook up and never leave the house again (except for occasional outings for 
<BR>
biking 'round the local mountains).  At that point I'll buy *several* of 
<BR>
your telebots.  One or two for business, one or two for terrestrial travels 
<BR>
and at least a couple for tooling 'round the solar system.
