<EM>&gt;does not exist. Atheism, on the other hand, has the equally silly claim that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;since none of them is the One True Religion, then none of them are True. All 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of them are True in the sense that they can allow one to relate to Divinity. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Ronin,
<BR>
<P>I can see from the above quote that you honestly know nothing about
<BR>
Atheism, so here's the correct definition;
<BR>
<P>Atheist - One who is without God belief.
<BR>
<P>We don't make silly claims, we don't make any claims, we simply do not
<BR>
maintain a belief in a diety.  People who believe in a religion make god
<BR>
claims.  The concept of Divinity is meaningless to an Atheist, as s/he has
<BR>
no belief in any god from which, or on behalf of who, such Divinity claims
<BR>
spring.  Some Atheists may indeed claim that god doesn't exist (called
<BR>
strong Atheism), but by definition, without knowing any further details,
<BR>
the definition above is the correct one.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure many other Atheists on the list would also not like to be &quot;straw
<BR>
manned&quot; as the above quote attempts to do.
<BR>
<P>Thank you,
<BR>
<P><P><P>James...
