<BR>
<P>Interesting how the belief that the body and its cravings must be repressed
<BR>
has so permeated the Western societies, even among the Extropians.  To equate
<BR>
the support of the ancient urges with stupidity form part of this. (Actually,
<BR>
one should follow these urges since the species needs all the intelligence
<BR>
it can get.)
<BR>
<P>Biologically speaking, the whole species of humans apparently share the
<BR>
notion of beauty (and thus of ugliness), as shown by scientific research.
<BR>
<P>Since the current state of technology does not allow for cloning, or other
<BR>
cheap non-sex alternatives, one may well need to use ``sexist'' techniques
<BR>
in the area of reproduction until such time when the technology level has
<BR>
increased sufficiently.
<BR>
<P>I don't find the ancient reproduction techniques offensive.  Thus I see no
<BR>
reason to suppress this information.
<BR>
<P>Your mileage may vary.
