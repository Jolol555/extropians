<EM>&gt; James Rogers and Mike Lorrey wrote stuff about the socially calming

<EM>&gt; benefits of gun ownership in response to my comments about:

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a bunch of soccer thugs in Britain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; They just lerrrrved smacking and bashing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the shit out of other people. Their blood was up, it boiled with rage and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; delight, they had flow and peak experience.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I foolishly ended this post with a throwaway remark about personal weaponry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The guys said:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Perhaps populations that &quot;pack heat&quot; have more evolved level of maturity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; or at least personal responsibility, than those that don't.  One thing is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; for certain: broadly armed populations definitely select for these traits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;An armed society creates an implied threat that shuts up loudmouths,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;tones down the emotionally heated, and essentially spontaneously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;organizes a polite society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, that's a relief. And here I was supposing that I'd drawn attention,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by analogy, to something deeply worrying about a future where, say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotech minting provides much of the essentials of life very cheap or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free, where AI displaces most of the brain-based jobs, and where many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; healthy young people will be stressed by the lack of extrinsic meaning in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their otherwise comfortable lives.
</EM><BR>
<P>A better question for the short term is to ask what is it about society
<BR>
in nations where such things occur that not only causes or contributes
<BR>
to this happening, but also what is that allows it to continue? We don't
<BR>
have such problems here in the US over any sport I know of.
