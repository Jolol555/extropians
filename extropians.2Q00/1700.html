I have commented to Damien offlist about this, but it is worth
<BR>
noting to the list as well.  Any conclusions regarding telomeres
<BR>
length and aging in such animals as mice, sheep, cows, etc. are
<BR>
likely to be HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE if extrapolated to human aging.
<BR>
<P>Species that do not have long lifespans, such as mice, and farm
<BR>
animals (bred for fast growth and other qualities, not longevity)
<BR>
are likely to have different controls on teleomere length and
<BR>
the length will have different effects vis-a-vis aging.
<BR>
<P>Other species, C. elegans, Drosophila, lobsters, etc. have very
<BR>
different physiologies and are even further from mammalian models
<BR>
of aging, and any extrapolations into the human arena should
<BR>
be taken with an even greater grain of salt.
<BR>
<P>Telomere length is fundamentally an anti-cancer control mechanism.
<BR>
When you see someone discussing telomere length in whales and
<BR>
elephants, that will be something to write about (since it may
<BR>
answer the question of whether they have similar anti-cancer
<BR>
programs or different programs that we can steal).
<BR>
<P>Even when we fully understand telomeres and telomerase, and how
<BR>
to regulate them, that will not be a &quot;magic bullet&quot; for aging
<BR>
since it does not solve the problems of aging in non-dividing cells,
<BR>
cell loss with age, accumulated DNA damage, etc, etc.

<EM>&gt; &quot;The study authors found the telomeres in the cloned cows were much

<EM>&gt; longer than the cells used to create the original fetus.
