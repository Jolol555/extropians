<EM>&gt; Good point. However considering the piracy rates in most countries, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copyrighted software from most vendors (with the sole exception being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wares that you need to call the maker to get a key for) is totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capable of being copied, so its merely a matter of the 11th commandment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The rate at which software copyrights are enforced begs one as to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether copy rights, per se, are de facto still recognized as civil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rights in any case, due to the spotty and capricious nature of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcement.
</EM><BR>
<P>All valid points. (Wot, me and Michael Lorrey agreeing right down the
<BR>
line?  Preposterous!) I'd add, however, that if (like me) you take the
<BR>
point of view that rights are social constructions that exist to the
<BR>
extent that they're enforced universally within society, copyright was
<BR>
never a right to begin with; it was a construct invented by government
<BR>
to ensure that inventors got some remuneration, nothing more and nothing
<BR>
less. This is a very flimsy raft upon which to build a solid information
<BR>
economy, and it's uncomfortable for those of us whose sole occupation
<BR>
is creating intellectual property, but it's something we have to face
<BR>
up to sooner or later: you can't physically hold onto an idea and exclude
<BR>
others from doing so, any more than you can prove the existence of qualia.
