<P><EM> &gt; without asking the PC owner first.  Only Microsoft thinks is a good
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;feature.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Microsoft has an ancient well-documented tradition of releasing
<BR>
unstable, insecure, (ILOVEYOU is just a recent instance, see BUGTRAQ
<BR>
archive for a truly impressive accomplishment track) poorely
<BR>
engineered poorly performing products with proprietary extensions of
<BR>
standards (standards are sure wonderful, everybody should have one),
<BR>
notoriously excessive hardware requirements, extremely poor
<BR>
scalability and portability, paired with a remarkable lack of features
<BR>
with at best mediocre high latency support, which is frequently so bad
<BR>
it's not there. They don't understand version control and proper
<BR>
software upgrading. They don't believe in strict separation in kernel
<BR>
and userland, and minimization of kernel code. They don't release
<BR>
their source nor development tools with full source, so users can't
<BR>
help themselves and other users. I wouldn't be surprised if their
<BR>
OSses and apps would have back doors, fed-mandated, and others.
<BR>
<P>In short, they suck on all fronts as far as I can see. According to
<BR>
what I hear, Win2k seems their first more or less decent product
<BR>
developed in-house. However, they need to release much more than that,
<BR>
to be able to gloss over their other deficiences. Also, they need many
<BR>
years of angelic behaviour to compensate for their abysmal track
<BR>
record. Right now I trust them in the extent as I have MS stock in my
<BR>
portfolio (I don't have any).
<BR>
<P>Their business practices over almost two decades demonstrate a
<BR>
remarkable lack of interest in serving their customers but a strong
<BR>
incentive in maximizing their revenues. They routinely use legal
<BR>
action and leverage of economies of scale to create and maintain
<BR>
product monopolies. (I don't blame them, I blame their idiot customers
<BR>
which allowed them to become what they became). Their record track is
<BR>
bad, and their trend points to worse. They are a huge sink of
<BR>
first-rate minds and developers (in terms of mindpower, the absence of
<BR>
output is conspicuous), which thus become lost to humanity's other
<BR>
enterprises. If they have good engineers, they hide that fact
<BR>
remarkably well.
<BR>
<P>This is only a highly incomplete ad hoc list. I would have expanded
<BR>
the list to many times this size, only I have more constructive things
<BR>
to do with my time. If anyone would still think this is highly
<BR>
subjective MS bashing (heck, I've been fuming over PC/MS cruft since
<BR>
PC/XT and DOS), be my guest. Just please don't lump me together with
<BR>
clueless newbie lemming MS bashers, because I'm not that. Ok?
<BR>
<P>Microsoft bashing is there for a Reason. Strangely, techies of any
<BR>
mettle tend to despise MS violently. Misguided MS bashers, all of
<BR>
them? If yes, then I'm in very fine company.
<BR>
<P>I don't mind other people using their products, as long as I don't
<BR>
have to clean up after them, and don't have to deal with their
<BR>
proprietary &quot;standards&quot; and perversions of standards they inflict upon
<BR>
those of us, who don't use their products.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, because other people use MS products, I have to deal
<BR>
with their aftermath (smoking ruins and misconfigurations, systems
<BR>
which need constant doctoring and periodic reinstalls to keep them
<BR>
minty-fresh), flaky Internet infrastructure, useless tech support
<BR>
lines, unreadable websites, HTML poop in my INBOX, multimegabyte
<BR>
attachements in unreadable formats, spam about viruses and similiar
<BR>
crapola. GAH, ICK, PTUI.
<BR>
<P>Thank you Microsoft. We all love you, and your lame customers.
