<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; He goes into it later in the post. I personally can't dissagree witht
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  the logic either, even though I'm libertarian, I'm a libertarian of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  Spartan sentiments.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>This having to do with that amendment of the constitution which rules against 
<BR>
involuntary servitude except as a condition of punishment.  To which military 
<BR>
conscription is &quot;winked&quot; at.  In other words....military conscription fits 
<BR>
all the rules of involuntary servitude...but since it's in the best interests 
<BR>
of the government for such to occur...it doesn't 'count'
<BR>
<P>In other other words...the constituition only applies when it's convienient?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;A man who has nothing worth dying for has nothing
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  worth living for, IMNSHO. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Some people feel differently is suppose...or perhaps &quot;worth&quot; is an individual 
<BR>
thing instead of mandated by the state?  What was &quot;worth&quot; dying for in Viet 
<BR>
Nam?  Who said so...? 
<BR>
<P>Perhaps they didn't think much of that particular conflict? Who was trying to 
<BR>
invade?  How did it impact on Hoboken or Des Moines? Or perhaps there was 
<BR>
evidence of us being on the wrong side? I reference the history of french 
<BR>
colonialism...the activities of said french during WWII and thereafter...and 
<BR>
McNamara's autobiography.  
<BR>
<P>People who refuse to enlist or be drafted
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  ought to be stripped of citizenship, as far as I am concerned.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like something out of a Heinlien Juvinile..

<EM>&gt;  If you had declared yourself as a contientious objector, the closest to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  combat you could serve is as a combat medic (which tends in the end to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  make you change your mind about things like that). 
</EM><BR>
<P>Not that it matters...but what actually happened is that I was 'induced&quot; to 
<BR>
volunteer.  I choose the Air Force.....  I was in SEA within weeks of 
<BR>
enlistment....I didn't see a LOT of combat...but I saw a lot of combat 
<BR>
hardware...and got an idea of how things were run.....not that it matters...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I personally don't think that the baby boomer's general opposition to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the draft had much to do with principle, it was merely a snivling case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of cowardice in general.
</EM><BR>
<P>That seems mighty strong words..You've been there then?  Charged across rice 
<BR>
fields into enemy fire because ..........because of what?.......what was 
<BR>
gained?  
<BR>
<P>It seems to me that avoiding the military altogether during that time frame 
<BR>
was more &quot;honorable&quot; than being in the military but being in it in such a 
<BR>
manner as to avoid all harm.  Kinda like the mafia is an &quot;honest&quot; crook while 
<BR>
a politician is a dishonest one...if you follow my analogy.  The principle of 
<BR>
it all.......
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;Most of these kids had been told by their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  parents that their parents had fought WWII so that junior wouldn't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to fight again, that kinda crap. Their opposition to the war had more to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  do with their personal opposition to being drafted. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Personal opposition to being drafted seems reasonable...given what they(we)  
<BR>
were taught in civics class regarding &quot;involintary servitude&quot;...especially in 
<BR>
light of government corruption (ours and our allies) and the hypocrisy of 
<BR>
various government officials...
<BR>
<P>Also since about age ten we were treated to the sight of fire fights on 
<BR>
Walter Cronkite at six  pm.  And just about every high school class had 
<BR>
recent graduates come home in a body bag.
<BR>
<P>Imagine that...a high school junior....who attends the funeral of a guy who 
<BR>
had only recently been a football hero?  Imagine seeing/ hearing of such 
<BR>
funerals since he could READ!!
<BR>
<P>Some coward huh....to want to avoid that?
<BR>
<P>Or how about when he came &quot;home&quot;...but found that home wasn't there any more? 
<BR>
&nbsp;And getting pelted by eggs and rotten fruit upon arrival....being called a 
<BR>
baby killer...
<BR>
<P>Calling someone a coward and &quot;sniveling&quot; seems contraindicated given such 
<BR>
data....
