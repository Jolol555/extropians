<P>Way too Eeyore, Terry.  The important thing is to find the object long
<BR>
enough in advance.  If we have 30 years notice (like the earth grazer
<BR>
that was identified a couple years ago, to swing by a couple million
<BR>
km from Earth in 2026) then we only need to produce a delta vee
<BR>
of a meter per second in the impacting body to have it pass a safe
<BR>
million km from Earth.
<BR>
<P>OK can we push a 10 km diameter pile of rubble to produce
<BR>
a 1 meter per second delta vee?  I think so.  Use the density
<BR>
numbers you quoted, 1.3 g/cm, and assume a shotgun pellet
<BR>
cloud of rubble.  Total mass about 10^15 kg.  Surface gravity
<BR>
would be about .3 millimeters/sec^2.  So long as you dont accelerate
<BR>
the mass any faster than .3 mm/sec^2, then loose stuff on the
<BR>
surface shouldnt float away.
<BR>
<P>So if we managed to set up some thrusters on the surface to
<BR>
accelerate the rubble pile at one thousanth that number,
<BR>
3E-7 m/sec^2, it would pick up the necessary delta vee in
<BR>
about a year.  That would require the thrusters to produce
<BR>
about 300 million newtons.  This doesnt sound too far out
<BR>
of the question.
<BR>
<P>Considering the nuclear ion thrusters already in existence,
<BR>
I would think we could land a bunch of them on the surface
<BR>
of an Earth-threatener and turn them all on.  Especially if
<BR>
the fate of humanity were at stake.  Tigger would take on
<BR>
that task.  Wooo hooo!  spike
