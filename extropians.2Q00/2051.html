<BR>
Ahem ...
<BR>
<P>I've recently done some installation comparison testing. On a given
<BR>
laptop, (HP Omnibook 800 -- a little long in the tooth, but fine for
<BR>
testing), an installation of Windows 95 OSR2 -- the version that HP
<BR>
customised for this machine -- required four reboots during the install
<BR>
process and bounced me into six interactive configuration dialogues.
<BR>
Corel Linux 1.0 rebooted just *once* (at the end of the installation)
<BR>
and was significantly easier on the typing front, too. To be fair:
<BR>
Corel Linux detected the CT6550 graphics chipset fine, and the SCSI bus,
<BR>
but missed out on APM and PCMCIA support -- these are not built into the
<BR>
stock Corel distro kernel as of 1.0 -- and also missed out on sound (a bit
<BR>
more serious, but easy to remedy if you know where www.opensound.com is).
<BR>
<P>Note that this was a comparison of a generation #1 product with a
<BR>
generation #5 product. And the generation #1 product was in the same
<BR>
ease-of-installation bracket as MacOS.
<BR>
<P>I've also lately installed Red Hat 6.1 (not 6.2 yet, the review copy is
<BR>
in the post, delayed due to stupid crypto export headaches) and would
<BR>
say that it's harder to install than Corel Linux -- but not as hard as,
<BR>
say, Windows 98.
<BR>
<P>It's also worth noting that installability is _not_ the yardstick by
<BR>
which operating system performance and usability is measured; it's just
<BR>
the first speed-bump on the road to usability, which is why magazine
<BR>
reviews tend to fetishize it. (I speak as a sometime magazine reviewer,
<BR>
albeit a bit of an eccentric one :)
<BR>
<P>What Corel have done -- which is interesting -- is to file some of the
<BR>
rough edges off the stock KDE 1.1 desktop distribution (found in Red Hat,
<BR>
SuSE, Caldera, and Debian's non-free section). However, KDE 2.0 is due out
<BR>
this summer ... and _that_ (along with accessories such as Magellan and 
<BR>
KOffice) is going to start worrying people in Redmond. For example, KOffice
<BR>
is currently feature-poor, but _very_ clean and 100% componentized; as a
<BR>
competitor for, say, AppleWorks, it's at least on the map at release 1.0. 
<BR>
Magellan is another matter; as groupware products go it is looking like a
<BR>
rather nice toy -- it's got a way to go before it can crush Lotus Notes or
<BR>
the combination of Exchange/Outlook, but that's the target it's aiming for.
<BR>
<P>Bear in mind that Linux isn't aiming at the desktop market, yet; it's
<BR>
still expanding in the server and embedded sectors, while us lunatics who
<BR>
deploy it on the desktop are bleeding-edge fringies. The existing body of
<BR>
Linux desktop productivity suites and applications is woeful. However,
<BR>
it exists -- and it is rapidly being augmented, so that last months'
<BR>
objections need not apply.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This demonstration is totally leaving aside the fact that the case does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recognize new developments in the market, it merely looks at the market at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time that the suit was submitted, as a snapshot of frozen time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not necessarily. Contemplate the Findings of Fact from the point of view of
<BR>
a Linux patriot and they make unpleasant reading; Judge Jackson's dismissal
<BR>
of open source as a viable alternative to Microsoft (at the time the findings
<BR>
were issued) makes sense. This struck me as being a fairly timely point, 
<BR>
although I expect it to become hopelessly obsolete over the next year or two.
