<P>
Following the recent Mars threads, and the parallel though unrelated outburst
<BR>
of heaton the &gt;H list, I feel I have to speak up about the public relations 
<BR>
gap futurists, and especially &gt;H and Extropians are facing.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Why live in a gravity well when you can disassemble the planets and 
<BR>
distribute their mass...&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;You can't own real estate on Mars, but you can rape it for resources...&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Pave the Universe&quot;
<BR>
<P>Even though these statements might be intended flippantly, sarcastically, or 
<BR>
simply in poor taste, these are prime examples of the problems that the 
<BR>
populace at large has with the radical futurist movements (of which 
<BR>
transhumanism and extropianism are a part, fortunately or no) - the total
<BR>
affront to what are accepted as aestheticaly pleasing to many people.
<BR>
<P>Consider the movement to ban forestry and strip mining.  &quot;Great claws and 
<BR>
gouges ripped into the earth&quot;... &quot;Poisoned rivers running crimson like blood
<BR>
from the mine openings&quot;... &quot;denuded hills, blasted into a seemingly post-
<BR>
apocalyptic wasteland&quot;... And people are talking about disassembling entire 
<BR>
PLANETS?  During the 70s and 80s there was ahuge industry involved in painting
<BR>
beautiful and alien vistas based on data collected from astronauts on the 
<BR>
moon and the various Voyager and Mariner probes.  
<BR>
<P>Claims like these, even if made in jest, will turn what could be a very strong 
<BR>
public relations asset to a serious disadvantage - instead of &quot;tour Mars: see
<BR>
the majestic cliffs of Olympus Mons&quot; the slogan would be &quot;don't return to the 
<BR>
1900s - save space from the industrialists&quot; or &quot;Don't repeat the mistakes of
<BR>
Earth - Don't mine Mars!&quot;
<BR>
<P>We have enough of a problem with negative PR, and no amount of dismissing
<BR>
&quot;the masses&quot; will keep them from pressuring government to make laws that
<BR>
hamper our cause, or save us from international governance that would make
<BR>
some of our tools illegal to even pursue, let alone possess.  If we fail now,
<BR>
and turn public opinion against us, the best we will be able to do would be
<BR>
to pick a small nation with enough resources to support our goals, move in 
<BR>
and basically try to get the people to go along with us enough to get into 
<BR>
space ourselves - as refugees.  Our grand leap forward would be the desperate
<BR>
casting of a ship to the waves of an unforgiving ocean into an environment 
<BR>
impossibly mre hostile than the last time n exodus of faith like this took 
<BR>
place.  And the governments we leave behind will still have the ability to 
<BR>
reach out and smite our habitations from afar.
<BR>
<P>I am not an advocate for censorship - self- or externally imposed - even though
<BR>
at first blush it seems that way.  With the essay by Joy and the favorable 
<BR>
responses, however, is it wise to continue to feed the flames?  Choose your 
<BR>
word and phrasings wisely, so they say what you mean - nothing less, nothing
<BR>
more.  Talk of &quot;raping&quot; a planet carries images that are unpalatable to even
<BR>
some of your fellows.
<BR>
