<P>
If I encountered the Waldemar Ingdahl of 10 years ago, I don't think we 
<BR>
would have very much to discuss. The experiences and the knowledge I have 
<BR>
had since then have changed me and my outlook on life. I think that the 
<BR>
younger Waldemar would have great difficulties following many of my 
<BR>
arguments and thoughts.
<BR>
<P>And that is how it should be.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, too many people don't change at all over 10 year spans.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
<P>Waldemar
