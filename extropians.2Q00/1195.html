<EM>&gt; &gt; Sounds nice.  But the minute you hold the state to the same standard as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; individuals, the state gives up all police power (except in those few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; circumstances were governmental employees or property are harmed or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; threatened) and all prisons must be emptied.  That might sound like a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thing to you, but the day it happens here is the day I move to Costa Rica.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, this is not true. The only greater authority police have that you a
</EM><BR>
nd
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't have is the ability to give traffic tickets, and in some states, arre
</EM><BR>
st
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for misdemeanor offenses. We are all authorized and responsible to apprehend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criminals committing felonies, and in the face of threat of deadly force, wit
</EM><BR>
h
<BR>
<EM>&gt; unarmed individuals present, lethal force is generally legal, though there ar
</EM><BR>
e
<BR>
<EM>&gt; differing thresholds.

<P>In New York State, Murder 1 (Capital) is reserved for killing a police
<BR>
officer in the line of duty:

<BR>
<P>In New York City, the right to carry a weapon is so restricted that
<BR>
police are among the only people who can do it fairly automatically.
<BR>
(The City Council are, too.)  The legislatures of New York City and
<BR>
New York State have thus created a situation in which a police officer
<BR>
is both trusted with deadly force and protected from deadly force in a
<BR>
manner in which fellow citizens are not.  Then there are the kinds of
<BR>
guns and bullets police officers have access to -- &quot;cop killer&quot;
<BR>
bullets.
<BR>
<P>I believe this imbalance can be disastrous, and leads to the worst
<BR>
possible relations between the police and the public, but generally
<BR>
the NYPD have supported (at least officially) New York's laws.
<BR>
<P>All the best!
