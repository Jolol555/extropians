Well, I guess that is what I think. So, what percentage of the readers of 
<BR>
this list believe in miracles, I wonder?  To me, the blooms on my hibiscus 
<BR>
plants are miracles.  But I don't think that's what most people mean by a 
<BR>
miracle . . .
<BR>

<BR>
<P>I consider a person like Dannion Brinkley who has had a near-death 
<BR>
experience that transformed his life, as having experienced a miracle.  He 
<BR>
had been a very hate-filled person who used physical and verbal intimidation 
<BR>
to get his way around others.  After his NDE he had a total change of heart 
<BR>
and apologized to those around him for the way he had been.  His family 
<BR>
could hardly believe the new Dannion.
<BR>
<P>I realize we could debate whether this was an actual supernatural experience 
<BR>
on his part or simply hallucinations from a brain that thought it was dying. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, it was a miracle in terms of his psychological transformation.
<BR>
<P>There is another kind of miracle that I can think of.  Everytime I see a 
<BR>
beautiful women I think &quot;MIRACLE!!&quot;  And then I think &quot;mmm mmm good!!&quot;  I 
<BR>
had better stop there.  :)
<BR>
