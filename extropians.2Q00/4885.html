<EM>&gt; &gt; I wonder if extropians have resistance to consumerist memes, if only 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  we pay attention to information sources other than consumerist media?
</EM><BR>
<P>I know that has played a big part of it for me.  When my kids were born, I 
<BR>
knew I didn't want them raised in front of the TV like I was; so I cancelled 
<BR>
the cable TV subscription.  It has been about 4 years since we were able to 
<BR>
get network TV in my house and I have found that this has had substantial 
<BR>
benefits:
<BR>
<P>(Fortunately) the only channel that our set can clearly pick up is PBS.  If 
<BR>
there is a channel that I *do* want my kids to watch its PBS.  Not having 
<BR>
been raised on typical Saturday morning TV, they don't miss it.  In fact 
<BR>
they actually *enjoy* watching PBS, but (naturally) not enough to veg out in 
<BR>
front of it all day.  Not being subject to continual commercial ads, they 
<BR>
don't fall for every toy, fad, whatever marketed to kids by TV advertisers.
<BR>
<P>This has ended up saving us tons of money.  First the cable bill (~$40/mo. 
<BR>
for programming that I hardly enjoyed anyway).  I have also found that being 
<BR>
out of the loop in terms of current cultural trends has saved me bucks too.  
<BR>
I've never been much of a fashion maven, but when I watched MTV a lot, I 
<BR>
found myself (subconciously or not) trying to stay up with those trends 
<BR>
(buying the latest music, clothes, concert tix).  Now I find that I only buy 
<BR>
clothes when mine wear out.  As long as the shoes fit, who cares if they're 
<BR>
the latest Nike, or whatever?
<BR>
<P>Perhaps most importantly, I realize that I enjoy reading much more than I 
<BR>
ever enjoyed TV -- and my kids are beginning to feel the same way.  That IMO 
<BR>
is probably the biggest benefit of all.
<BR>
<P>Suffice it to say that, even if they gave it away for free, I'd never get my 
<BR>
cable TV hooked back up.  Plus, I spent the money I'd otherwise be spending 
<BR>
on TV on a high-bandwidth net connection, which I also find more useful and 
<BR>
enjoyable than I ever found TV to be.
