<P>OK but not necessarily.  My family tradition has it that we were the
<BR>
original rednecks: so named by urban dwellers because the coal miners
<BR>
of West Virginia would wear red neckerchiefs [not so different from
<BR>
the way boy scouts wear them today] with blue coveralls as they
<BR>
descended into the bowels of the earth to retrieve the coal that
<BR>
fueled the industrial revolution.  These simple hard-working proletariate
<BR>
were thus labelled red-necks, and they carried this derisive title
<BR>
with pride.
<BR>
<P>Racism would not be part of their repertoir, as there were men of
<BR>
every race among the coal miners, in fact they were far more accepting
<BR>
of the black man than any of their city counterparts.  *All* of these
<BR>
men were black at the end of the day.
<BR>
<P>As for the other charges: backward?  Probably.  Violent behavior
<BR>
against gays and hippies?  Well, the violent behavior part probably
<BR>
works, but I doubt they would necessarily specialize in gays and
<BR>
hippies, as the original rednecks most likely never encountered
<BR>
either of such species.  spike
