<EM>&gt; &gt; As one who deeply respects Gates and Microsoft, I want MS to resume as it

<EM>&gt; On the other hand, it's galling to see the US government feeling compelled

<EM>&gt; to intervene heavy-handedly, and even more galling to see them going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after MS for basically irrelevent reasons and imposing a silly 'solution'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that isn't going to help the situation.

<P>The things that most people don't understand is that there are two main
<BR>
reasons why the government went after Microsoft:
<BR>
<P>a) Microsoft doesn't donate money to politicians (i.e. they haven't
<BR>
gotten the clue about keeping the cops bribed)
<BR>
<P>b) Many lawyers in general, and their paralegals in particular hate
<BR>
Microsoft for turning what was once the best and best selling word
<BR>
processor into a virtual Canadian orphan (Word Perfect). Those that gave
<BR>
in to the marketing and bought Word wound up getting their investments
<BR>
in that software wasted when it became decertified for writing legal
<BR>
briefs, specifically because Word doesn't accurately count words.
