<P>I sure hope they've been warned about these guys, they should have moved the
<BR>
meeting to Canada. I've noticed that the meetings in Windsor Ontario and Calgary
<BR>
by various world groups have gone off well with few major disturbances.
<BR>
Apparently the FBI has supplied the Canadians with lists of anyone who has ever
<BR>
been busted for being in leftist demonstrations here in the US, and I'm sure
<BR>
there's some input from other countries as well. The Canadians are jailing
<BR>
anyone on the list that tries to cross the border for the duration of whatever
<BR>
meetings are going on, on the grounds that since most protest convictions are
<BR>
misdemeanors, its technically illegal for people with criminal records of
<BR>
misdemeanors or higher to travel into Canada. The Windsor cops had some
<BR>
undercover people at the DAG meetings to pick out the key organizers and
<BR>
strategists that got in anyways, who then got picked up by unmarked vans after
<BR>
the meetings while they were walking the streets.
<BR>
&nbsp;Very effective work, I must say, and the protesters are whining like stuck pigs
<BR>
about the inhumanity of it all, which is odd, since Canada is supposedly their
<BR>
picture perfect socialist democracy, multicultural, environmentally friendly,
<BR>
union friendly, with all the favorite wobbly welfare programs. Funny what
<BR>
happens when you set up your society so that the government controls what rights
<BR>
you have...
