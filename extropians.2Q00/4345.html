<BR>

<P>And you don't notice how stupid the above sounds?

<P>If snooping on your neighbour is illegal and everybody does it, then what?
<BR>
Put everybody in prison?

<P>If snooping on your neighbour is not illegal then everybody does it, and
<BR>
if some pedophiles masturbate over the young, then they are in their right.
<BR>
<P>Of course, if the Holier Than Thou start a jihad against anybody who is not
<BR>
like them, then they would naturally really _have_ to be holier than anybody
<BR>
else since everybody will really be out to check their personal lives.
<BR>
<P>The power mongers will naturally not like the idea that the commoners get to
<BR>
look at their magical kingdom, so you can be pretty certain that surveillance
<BR>
will stand in the hand of the mighty, anyway.
