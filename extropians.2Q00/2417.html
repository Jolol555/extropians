</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;With the speech recognition and synthesis software in its *current* state,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is not perfect but pretty good, it is clear that there is no longer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any need for people to learn languages. Rather they will buy them.
</EM><BR>
<P>However, this idea misses something that I think is an important aspect
<BR>
to learning a language: learning the culture.
<BR>
<P>Embedded in the language are the thousands of nuances that describe a
<BR>
culture of people.
<BR>
<P>I don't have an easy time with languages, however I am fascinated with
<BR>
language differences that say something about the people speaking
<BR>
that language.
<BR>
<P>For example, the verb is often placed at the end of a German sentence,
<BR>
and you may know that German sentences are often long. So if one wants
<BR>
to know the action of the sentence for which a speaker speaks, then one
<BR>
must wait until the very end. I noticed that the result of the Germans way
<BR>
of speaking is a kind of politeness with very few interruptions.
<BR>
<P>Now, native German speakers tell me that they know the action of the sentence
<BR>
from the context, so that interruptions still occur, but I propose that
<BR>
there are far fewer rude and impolite remarks in a German discussion than
<BR>
in an English discussion (where the verb is usually stated right away).
<BR>
<P>Another example is something I just learned regarding the French language.
<BR>
I spent the last two weeks in France, and I stumbled by with the basic words
<BR>
like hello, please, thank you, counting numbers, etc. but I had some trouble
<BR>
with &quot;you're welcome&quot;. You know, that word that you should say in any
<BR>
language when someone opens the door for you, or some similar nice
<BR>
gesture. Usually it is just one word.
<BR>
<P>However, I discovered that the French have a lot of different words
<BR>
for saying &quot;you're welcome&quot; with slightly different meanings, depending on
<BR>
the context! What can that tell you about the people? I interpret that
<BR>
charming language nuance as: the context of &quot;thank you/you're welcome&quot;
<BR>
has enough importance to this culture that they have expanded it into
<BR>
a flavorful variety of choices, to give the communicators more expression
<BR>
to this particular situation.
<BR>
<P>Now how would one put these thousands of charming language nuances that
<BR>
describe a culture into a language translator?  Perhaps this is a question
<BR>
to the linguists on the list.
<BR>
<P>I think that it is an impossible task, and furthermore, why would one
<BR>
want to?  (I wouldn't)
<BR>
