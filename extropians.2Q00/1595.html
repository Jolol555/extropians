<P>
The ideas for the cryonics enclave continue to roll forth.  The hospice will 
<BR>
be built in the advanced stages of the project.  I was somehow surprised but 
<BR>
delighted to read that an &quot;interfaith chapel&quot; of some kind would be built.  
<BR>
I just hope a bunch of bullying extropians don't come over and make trouble 
<BR>
there!  :)
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
<P>John

<EM>&gt;Subject: cryonics community need art
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Dave, this is Kaburagi. (Call me &gt;Kabu) Sorry for my &quot;turtle&quot; response, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;since my English ability is not so high-level. you said: What are the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;things you want?  Be specific!
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I want a musical instrument to play.
</EM><BR>
<P>Kabu:  You have to bring your own instrument, but we will have a place
<BR>
where we all meet in the evenings to relax, play music, sing and do other
<BR>
things to entertain each other.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My wife does musical therapy at hospices in Japan.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;She visits patients in their rooms with her keyboard,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Plays the songs they request her, And is appreciated by them very much.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds nice.  Not at first, but after we are further along with the
<BR>
community and other facilities, we want to have a hospice for cryonicists
<BR>
waiting to go into suspension.  I'm sure your wife's music and attention
<BR>
will be very welcome.  Are you both signed up for cryonics?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I want a small stage to do some performance.  It isn't necessarily a &gt;large 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Of course I want to hold a concert there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But even more fulfilling experience will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Putting making up a play with my friends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And putting it on the stage all by ourselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>Many people have asked for a place like this.  And as mentioned above, we
<BR>
will have a nice one. I want a place to pray.  It isn't necessarily a 
<BR>
chapel.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But it would be wonderful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If the building has a Buckminster Fuller's dome on its roof.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mike Perry will be in charge of this.  I am sure he will plan something
<BR>
very beautiful.
