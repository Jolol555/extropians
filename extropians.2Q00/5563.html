<P>THE SECOND COMING — A MANIFESTO
<BR>
By David Gelernter
<BR>
<P>Any Microsecond Now
<BR>
<P>Computing will be transformed. It's not just that our problems are big, 
<BR>
they are big and obvious. It's not just that the solutions are simple, they 
<BR>
are simple and right under our noses. It's not just that hardware is more 
<BR>
advanced than software; the last big operating-systems breakthrough was the 
<BR>
Macintosh, sixteen years ago, and today's hottest item is Linux, which is a 
<BR>
version of Unix, which was new in 1976. Users react to the hard truth that 
<BR>
commerical software applications tend to be badly-designed, badly-made, 
<BR>
incomprehensible and obsolete by blaming themselves (&quot;Computers for 
<BR>
Morons,&quot; &quot;Operating Systems for Livestock&quot;), and meanwhile, money surges 
<BR>
through our communal imagination like beer from burst barrels. Billions. 
<BR>
Naturally the atmosphere is a little strange; change is coming, soon.
<BR>
<P>Everything Old Is New Again
<BR>
<P>1. No matter how certain its eventual coming, an event whose exact time and 
<BR>
form of arrival are unknown vanishes when we picture the future. We tend 
<BR>
not to believe in the next big war or economic swing; we certainly don't 
<BR>
believe in the next big software revolution.
<BR>
<P>2. Because we don't believe in technological change (we only say we do), we 
<BR>
accept bad computer products with a shrug; we work around them, make the 
<BR>
best of them and (like fatalistic sixteenth-century French peasants) barely 
<BR>
even notice their defects — instead of demanding that they be fixed and 
<BR>
changed.
<BR>
<P>3. Everything is up for grabs. Everything will change. There is a 
<BR>
magnificent sweep of intellectual landscape right in front of us.
<BR>
<P>4. The Orwell law of the future: any new technology that can be tried will 
<BR>
be. Like Adam Smith's invisible hand (leading capitalist economies toward 
<BR>
ever-increasing wealth), Orwell's Law is an empirical fact of life.
<BR>
Ripe Ready and hanging by a thread
<BR>
<P>5. We know that big developments are inevitable in the software world — if 
<BR>
only because nothing in that world corresponds to a &quot;book.&quot; You can see a 
<BR>
book whole from the outside. You know in advance how a book is laid out — 
<BR>
where the contents or the index will be — and how to &quot;operate&quot; one. As you 
<BR>
work through it, you always know where you stand: how far you have gone and 
<BR>
how much is left. &quot;Book&quot; can be a physical object or a text — an 
<BR>
abstraction with many interchangeable physical embodiments. These 
<BR>
properties don't hold for file systems or web sites. You can't see or judge 
<BR>
one from the outside, anticipate the lay-out, tell where you stand as you 
<BR>
work your way through.
<BR>
<P>Whenever we are organizing information, the book is too powerful an idea to 
<BR>
do without in some form or other.
<BR>
<P>6. Miniaturization was the big theme in the first age of computers: rising 
<BR>
power, falling prices, computers for everybody. Theme of the Second Age now 
<BR>
approaching: computing transcends computers. Information travels through a 
<BR>
sea of anonymous, interchangeable computers like a breeze through tall 
<BR>
grass. A dekstop computer is a scooped-out hole in the beach where 
<BR>
information from the Cybersphere wells up like seawater.
<BR>
<P>7. &quot;The network is the computer&quot; — yes; but we're less interested in 
<BR>
computers all the time. The real topic in astronomy is the cosmos, not 
<BR>
telescopes. The real topic in computing is the Cybersphere and the 
<BR>
cyberstructures in it, not the computers we use as telescopes and tuners.
<BR>
<P>8. The software systems we depend on most today are operating systems 
<BR>
(Unix, the Macintosh OS, Windows et. al.) and browsers (Internet Explorer, 
<BR>
Netscape Communicator...). Operating systems are connectors that fasten 
<BR>
users to computers; they attach to the computer at one end, the user at the 
<BR>
other. Browsers fasten users to remote computers, to &quot;servers&quot; on the 
<BR>
internet.
<BR>
<P>Today's operating systems and browsers are obsolete because people no 
<BR>
longer want to be connected to computers — near ones OR remote ones. (They 
<BR>
probably never did). They want to be connected to information. In the 
<BR>
future, people are connected to cyberbodies; cyberbodies drift in the 
<BR>
computational cosmos — also known as the Swarm, the Cybersphere.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;From The Prim Pristine Net To The Omnipresent Swarm
<BR>
<P>9. The computing future is based on &quot;cyberbodies&quot; — self-contained, 
<BR>
neatly-ordered, beautifully-laid-out collections of information, like 
<BR>
immaculate giant gardens.
<BR>
<P>10. You will walk up to any &quot;tuner&quot; (a computer at home, work or the 
<BR>
supermarket, or a TV, a telephone, any kind of electronic device) and slip 
<BR>
in a &quot;calling card,&quot; which identifes a cyberbody. The tuner tunes it in. 
<BR>
The cyberbody arrives and settles in like a bluebird perching on a branch.
<BR>
<P>11. Your whole electronic life will be stored in a cyberbody. You can 
<BR>
summon it to any tuner at any time.
<BR>
<P>12. By slipping it your calling card, you customize any electronic device 
<BR>
you touch; for as long as it holds your card, the machine knows your habits 
<BR>
and preferences better than you know them yourself.
<BR>
<P>13. Any well-designed next-generation electronic gadget will come with a 
<BR>
``Disable Omniscience'' button.
<BR>
<P>14. The important challenge in computing today is to spend computing power, 
<BR>
not horde it.
<BR>
<P>16. The future is dense with computers. They will hang around everywhere in 
<BR>
lush growths like Spanish moss. They will swarm like locusts. But a swarm 
<BR>
is not merely a big crowd. The individuals in the swarm lose their 
<BR>
identities. The computers that make up this global swarm will blend 
<BR>
together into the seamless substance of the Cybersphere. Within the swarm, 
<BR>
individual computers will be as anonymous as molecules of air.
<BR>
<P>17. A cyberbody can be replicated or distributed over many computers; can 
<BR>
inhabit many computers at the same time. If the Cybersphere's computers are 
<BR>
tiles in a paved courtyard, a cyberbody is a cloud's drifting shadow 
<BR>
covering many tiles simultaneously.
<BR>
<P>18. But the Net will change radically before it dies. When you deal with a 
<BR>
remote web site, you largely bypass the power of your desktop in favor of 
<BR>
the far-off power of a web server. Using your powerful desktop computer as 
<BR>
a mere channel to reach web sites, reaching through and beyond it instead 
<BR>
of using it, is like renting a Hyundai and keeing your Porsche in the 
<BR>
garage. Like executing programs out of disk storage instead of main memory 
<BR>
and cache. The Web makes the desktop impotent.
<BR>
<P>19. The power of desktop machines is a magnet that will reverse today's 
<BR>
&quot;everything onto the Web!&quot; trend.
<BR>
Desktop power will inevitably drag information out of remote servers onto 
<BR>
desktops.
<BR>
<P>20. If a million people use a Web site simultaneously, doesn't that mean 
<BR>
that we must have a heavy-duty remote server to keep them all happy? No; we 
<BR>
could move the site onto a million desktops and use the internet for 
<BR>
coordination. The &quot;site&quot; is like a military unit in the field, the general 
<BR>
moving with his troops (or like a hockey team in constant swarming motion). 
<BR>
(We used essentially this technique to build the first tuple space 
<BR>
implementations. They seemed to depend on a shared server, but the server 
<BR>
was an illusion; there was no server, just a swarm of clients.) Could 
<BR>
Amazon.com be an itinerant horde instead of a fixed Central Command Post? Yes.
<BR>
<P>Stranger Than Fiction: Computers Today
<BR>
<P>21. The windows-menus-mouse &quot;desktop&quot; interface, invented by Xerox and 
<BR>
Apple and now universal, was a brilliant invention and is now obsolete. It 
<BR>
wastes screen-space on meaningless images, fails to provide adequate clues 
<BR>
to what is inside the files represented by those blurry little images, 
<BR>
forces users to choose icons for the desktop when the system could choose 
<BR>
them better itself, and keeps users jockeying windows (like parking 
<BR>
attendants rearranging cars in a pint-sized Manhattan lot) in a losing 
<BR>
battle for an unimpeded view of the workspace — which is, ultimately, 
<BR>
unattainable. No such unimpeded view exists.
<BR>
<P>22. Icons and &quot;collapsed views&quot; seem new but we have met them before. Any 
<BR>
book has a &quot;collapsed&quot; or &quot;iconified&quot; view, namely its spine. An icon 
<BR>
conveys far less information that the average book spine — and is much 
<BR>
smaller. should it be much smaller? Might a horizontal stack of &quot;book 
<BR>
spines&quot; onscreen be more useful than a clutter of icons?
<BR>
<P>23. The computer mouse was a brilliant invention, but we can see today that 
<BR>
it is a bad design. Like any device that must be moved and placed 
<BR>
precisely, it ought to provide tactile feedback; it doesn't.
<BR>
<P>24. Metaphors have a profound effect on computing. The desktop metaphor 
<BR>
traps us in a &quot;broad&quot; instead of &quot;deep&quot; arrangement of information that is 
<BR>
fundamentally wrong for computer screens. Compared to a standard page of 
<BR>
words, an actual desktop is big and a computer screen is small. A desktop 
<BR>
is easily extended (use drawers, other desks, tables, the floor); a 
<BR>
computer screen is not.
<BR>
<P>25. Apple could have described its interface as a pure &quot;information 
<BR>
landscape,&quot; with no connection to a desktop; we invented this landscape 
<BR>
(they might have explained) the way a landscape architect or amusement park 
<BR>
designer invents a landscape. We invented an ideal space for seeing and 
<BR>
managing computerized information. Our landscape is imaginary, but you can 
<BR>
still enter and move around it. The computer screen is the window of your 
<BR>
vehicle, the face-shield of your diving-helmet.
<BR>
<P>26. Under the desktop metaphor, the screen IS the interface — the interface 
<BR>
is a square foot or two of glowing colors on a glass panel. In the 
<BR>
landscape metaphor, the screen is just a viewing pane. When you look 
<BR>
through it, you see the actual interface lying beyond.
<BR>
<P>Problems On The Surface And Under The Surface
<BR>
<P>27. Modern computing is based on an analogy between computers and file 
<BR>
cabinets that is fundamentally wrong and affects nearly every move we make. 
<BR>
(We store &quot;files&quot; on disks, write &quot;records,&quot; organize files into &quot;folders&quot; 
<BR>
— file-cabinet language.) Computers are fundamentally unlike file cabinets 
<BR>
because they can take action.
<BR>
<P>28. Metaphors have a profound effect on computing: the file-cabinet 
<BR>
metaphor traps us in a &quot;passive&quot; instead of &quot;active&quot; view of information 
<BR>
management that is fundamentally wrong for computers.
<BR>
<P>29. The rigid file and directory system you are stuck with on your Mac or 
<BR>
PC was designed by programmers for programmers — and is still a good system 
<BR>
for programmers. It is no good for non-programmers. It never was, and was 
<BR>
never intended to be.
<BR>
<P>30. If you have three pet dogs, give them names. If you have 10,000 head of 
<BR>
cattle, don't bother. Nowadays the idea of giving a name to every file on 
<BR>
your computer is ridiculous.
<BR>
<P>31. Our standard policy on file names has far-reaching consequences: 
<BR>
doesn't merely force us to make up names where no name is called for; also 
<BR>
imposes strong limits on our handling of an important class of documents — 
<BR>
ones that arrive from the outside world. A newly-arrived email message (for 
<BR>
example) can't stand on its own as a separate document — can't show up 
<BR>
alongside other files in searches, sit by itself on the desktop, be opened 
<BR>
or printed independently; it has no name, so it must be buried on arrival 
<BR>
inside some existing file (the mail file) that does have a name. The same 
<BR>
holds for incoming photos and faxes, Web bookmarks, scanned images...
<BR>
<P>32. You shouldn't have to put files in directories. The directories should 
<BR>
reach out and take them. If a file belongs in six directories, all six 
<BR>
should reach out and grab it automatically, simultaneously.
<BR>
<P>33. A file should be allowed to have no name, one name or many names. Many 
<BR>
files should be allowed to share one name. A file should be allowed to be 
<BR>
in no directory, one directory, or many directories. Many files should be 
<BR>
allowed to share one directory. Of these eight possibilities, only three 
<BR>
are legal and the other five are banned — for no good reason.
<BR>
<P>Streams Of Time
<BR>
<P>34. In the beginning, computers dealt mainly in numbers and words. Today 
<BR>
they deal mainly with pictures. In a new period now emerging, they will 
<BR>
deal mainly with tangible time — time made visible and concrete. 
<BR>
Chronologies and timelines tend to be awkward in the off-computer world of 
<BR>
paper, but they are natural online.
<BR>
<P>35. Computers make alphabetical order obsolete.
<BR>
<P>36. File cabinets and human minds are information-storage systems. We could 
<BR>
model computerized information-storage on the mind instead of the file 
<BR>
cabinet if we wanted to.
<BR>
<P>37. Elements stored in a mind do not have names and are not organized into 
<BR>
folders; are retrieved not by name or folder but by contents. (Hear a 
<BR>
voice, think of a face: you've retrieved a memory that contains the voice 
<BR>
as one component.) You can see everything in your memory from the 
<BR>
standpoint of past, present and future. Using a file cabinet, you classify 
<BR>
information when you put it in; minds classify information when it is taken 
<BR>
out. (Yesterday afternoon at four you stood with Natasha on Fifth Avenue in 
<BR>
the rain — as you might recall when you are thinking about &quot;Fifth Avenue,&quot; 
<BR>
&quot;rain,&quot; &quot;Natasha&quot; or many other things. But you attached no such labels to 
<BR>
the memory when you acquired it. The classification happened retrospectively.)
<BR>
<P>38. A &quot;lifestream&quot; organizes information not as a file cabinet does but 
<BR>
roughly as a mind does.
<BR>
<P>39. A lifestream is a sequence of all kinds of documents — all the 
<BR>
electronic documents, digital photos, applications, Web bookmarks, rolodex 
<BR>
cards, email messages and every other digital information chunk in your 
<BR>
life — arranged from oldest to youngest, constantly growing as new 
<BR>
documents arrive, easy to browse and search, with a past, present and 
<BR>
future, appearing on your screen as a receding parade of index cards. 
<BR>
Documents have no names and there are no directories; you retrieve elements 
<BR>
by content: &quot;Fifth Avenue&quot; yields a sub-stream of every document that 
<BR>
mentions Fifth Avenue.
<BR>
<P>40. A stream flows because time flows, and the stream is a concrete 
<BR>
representation of time. The &quot;now&quot; line divides past from future. If you 
<BR>
have a meeting at 10AM tomorow, you put a reminder document in the future 
<BR>
of your stream, at 10AM tomorrow. It flows steadily towards now. When now 
<BR>
equals 10AM tomorrow, the reminder leaps over the now line and flows into 
<BR>
the past. When you look at the future of your stream you see your plans and 
<BR>
appointments, flowing steadily out of the future into the present, then the 
<BR>
past.
<BR>
<P>41. You manage a lifestream using two basic controls, put and focus, which 
<BR>
correspond roughly to acquiring a new memory and remembering an old one.
<BR>
<P>42. To send email, you put a document on someone else's stream. To add a 
<BR>
note to your calendar, you put a document in the future of your own stream. 
<BR>
To continue work on an old document, put a copy at the head of your stream. 
<BR>
Sending email, updating the calendar, opening a document are three 
<BR>
instances of the same operation (put a document on a stream).
<BR>
<P>43. A substream (for example the &quot;Fifth Avenue&quot; substream) is like a 
<BR>
conventional directory — except that it builds itself, automatically; it 
<BR>
traps new documents as they arrive; one document can be in many substreams; 
<BR>
and a substream has the same structure as the main stream — a past, present 
<BR>
and future; steady flow.
<BR>
<P>In The Age Of Tangible Time
<BR>
<P>44. The point of lifestreams isn't to shift from one software structure to 
<BR>
another but to shift the whole premise of computerized information: to stop 
<BR>
building glorified file cabinets and start building (simplified, abstract) 
<BR>
artificial minds; and to store our electronic lives inside.
<BR>
<P>45. A lifestream can replace the desktop and subsume the functions of the 
<BR>
file system, email system and calendar system. You can store a movie, TV 
<BR>
station, virtual museum, electronic store, course of instruction at any 
<BR>
level, electronic auction or an institution's past, present and future (its 
<BR>
archives, its current news and its future plans) in a lifestream. Many 
<BR>
websites will be organized as lifestreams.
<BR>
<P>46. The lifestream (or some other system with the same properties) will 
<BR>
become the most important information-organizing structure in computing — 
<BR>
because even a rough imitation of the human mind is vastly more powerful 
<BR>
than the most sophisticated file cabinet ever conceived.
<BR>
<P>47. Lifestreams (in preliminary form) are a successful commercial product 
<BR>
today, but my predictions have nothing to do with this product. Ultimately 
<BR>
the product may succeed or fail. The idea will succeed.
<BR>
<P>Living Timestreams
<BR>
<P>48. Lifestreams today are conventional information structures, stored at 
<BR>
web sites and tuned-in using browsers. In the future they will be cyberbodies.
<BR>
<P>49. Today's operating systems connect users to computers. In the future we 
<BR>
will deal directly with information, in the form of cyberbodies. Operating 
<BR>
systems will connect cyberbodies to computers; will allow cyberbodies to 
<BR>
dock on computers. Users won't deal with operating systems any more, and 
<BR>
won't care about them. Your computer's operating system will make as much 
<BR>
difference to you as the voltage level of a bit in memory.
<BR>
<P>50. A lifestream is a landscape you can navigate or fly over at any level. 
<BR>
Flying towards the start of the stream is &quot;time travel&quot; into the past.
<BR>
<P>45. You can walk alongside a lifestream (browsing or searching) or you can 
<BR>
jump in and be immersed in information.
<BR>
<P>51. A well-designed store or public building allows you to size up the 
<BR>
whole space from outside, or as soon as you walk in — you see immediately 
<BR>
how things are laid out and roughly how large and deep the space is. 
<BR>
Today's typical web site is a failure because it is opaque. You ought to be 
<BR>
able to see immediately (not deduce or calculate) how the site is arranged, 
<BR>
how big it is, how deep and how broad. It ought to be transparent. (For an 
<BR>
example of a &quot;transparent&quot; web site, Mirror Worlds — figure 7.6.)
<BR>
<P>52. Movies, TV shows, virtual museums and all sorts of other cultural 
<BR>
products from symphonies to baseball games will be stored in lifestreams. 
<BR>
In other words: each cultural product will be delivered to you in the form 
<BR>
of an artifical mind. You will deal with it not as you deal with an object 
<BR>
but roughly as you do with a person.
<BR>
<P>Institutions Afloat In The Cybersphere
<BR>
<P>53. Your car, your school, your company and yourself are all one-track 
<BR>
vehicles moving forward through time, and they will each leave a 
<BR>
stream-shaped cyberbody (like an aircraft's contrail) behind them as they 
<BR>
go. These vapor-trails of crystallized experience will represent our first 
<BR>
concrete answer to a hard question: what is a company, a university, any 
<BR>
sort of ongoing organization or institution, if its staff and customers and 
<BR>
owners can all change, its buildings be bulldozed, its site relocated — 
<BR>
what's left? What is it? The answer: a lifestream in cyberspace.
<BR>
<P>54. A software or service company equals the employees plus the company 
<BR>
lifestream. Every employee has his own view of the communal stream. The 
<BR>
company's web site is the publically-accessible substream of the main 
<BR>
company stream. The company's lifestream is an electronic approximation of 
<BR>
the company's memories, its communal mind.
<BR>
<P>50. Lifestreams don't yield the &quot;paperless office.&quot; (The &quot;paperless office&quot; 
<BR>
is a bad idea because paper is one of the most useful and valuable media 
<BR>
ever invented.) But lifestreams can turn office paper into a temporary 
<BR>
medium — for use, not storage. &quot;On paper&quot; is a good place for information 
<BR>
you want to use; a bad place for information you want to store. In the 
<BR>
stream-based office, for each newly-created or -received paper document: 
<BR>
scan it into the stream and throw it away. When you need a paper document: 
<BR>
find it in the stream; print it out; use it; if you wrote on the paper 
<BR>
while using it, scan it back in; throw it ou
<BR>
<P>55. Software can solve hard problems in two ways: by algorithm or by making 
<BR>
connections — by delivering the problem to exactly the right human 
<BR>
problem-solver. The second technique is just as powerful as the first, but 
<BR>
so far we have ignored it.
<BR>
The Second Coming Of The Computer
<BR>
<P>56. Lifestreams and microcosms are the two most important cyberbody types; 
<BR>
they relate to each other as a single musical line relates to a single 
<BR>
chord. The stream is a &quot;moment in space,&quot; the microcosm a moment in time.
<BR>
<P>57. Nowadays we use a scanner to transfer a document's electronic image 
<BR>
into a computer. Soon, the scanner will become a Cybersphere port of entry, 
<BR>
an all-purpose in-box. Put any object in the in-box and the system develops 
<BR>
an accurate 3D physical transcription, and drops the transcription into the 
<BR>
cool dark well of cyberspace. So the Cybersphere starts to take on just a 
<BR>
hint of the textural richness of real life.
<BR>
<P>We'll know the system is working when a butterfly wanders into the in-box 
<BR>
and (a few wingbeats later) flutters out — and in that brief interval the 
<BR>
system has transcribed the creature's appearance and analyzed its way of 
<BR>
moving, and the real butterfly leaves a shadow-butterfly behind. Some time 
<BR>
soon afterward you'll be examining some tedious electronic document and a 
<BR>
cyber-butterfly will appear at the bottom left corner of your screen (maybe 
<BR>
a Hamearis lucina) and pause there, briefly hiding the text (and showing 
<BR>
its neatly-folded rusty-chocolate wings like Victorian paisley, with orange 
<BR>
eyespots) — and moments later will have crossed the screen and be gone.
<BR>
<P>But What Does It All Matter?
<BR>
<P>58. If you have plenty of money, the best consequence (so they say) is that 
<BR>
you no longer need to think about money. In the future we will have plenty 
<BR>
of technology — and the best consequence will be that we will no longer 
<BR>
have to think about technology.
<BR>
<P>We will return with gratitude and relief to the topics that actually count.
