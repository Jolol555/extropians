<EM>&gt; HTML was not made by a company.  It was first written by a scientist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking for a better way to share information, and freely given away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There was no commercial incentive - at least, not until Netscape came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; along.  A number of other widely-supported computer standards - HTTP and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux, to name a couple of the more popular ones - similarly had no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporate backing before they became popular enough for companies to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take notice.
</EM><BR>
<P>And your point is?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Portability standards, like Java, HTML or POSIX, are essentially
</EM><BR>
marketing
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; efforts launched by coalitions of companies who do not have enough
</EM><BR>
market
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; share to be viable competitors by themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Interoperability standards, like TCP and HTTP, are another matter.
</EM><BR>
Because
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their purpose is to allow products from different vendors to work
</EM><BR>
together,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it is usually in everyone's best interests to fully codify and support
</EM><BR>
them.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I submit the up-and-coming Wireless Application Protocol as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counterexample.  It's an interoperability standard that, at its start,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was launched by Unwired Planet (now Phone.com) and whoever it could beg
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into supporting.  WAP is sufficiently unstable that, aside from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Phone.com, practically everyone who officially supports WAP also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supports WAP's competitors - for instance, UDP/IP.
</EM><BR>
<P>How is that supposed to be a counterexample? I never said that all standards
<BR>
efforts are automatically successful. I simply said that interoperability
<BR>
standards often succeed because it is in everyone's best interests to make
<BR>
sure that they do, while  portability standards tend to become useless
<BR>
political footballs because it is in the best interests of their promoters
<BR>
to do things that ultimately undermine the standard.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; No one is *entrusted* with anything in a free market. Commercial
</EM><BR>
entities
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can only control a vital technology if they are actually doing a decent
</EM><BR>
job
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of managing it, because the moment they begin making mistakes they
</EM><BR>
create an
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; opportunity for rivals to make big money by fixing things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So long as the screw-ups haven't placed so many barriers to leaving -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for instance, holding the domain name they bought for you even after you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; send notice to NSI that the ISP no longer has your business and thus no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longer has a right to your trademark, or just plain buying up the ISP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you were going to switch to - that switching becomes financially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infeasable.
</EM><BR>
<P>What on Earth does a random litany of service complaints about some ISP have
<BR>
to do with the general issue of control of technologies?
<BR>
<P>I hope you aren't going to try to convince me that some government agency
<BR>
should take over managing IP addresses (oh, I'm sure they'd be ever so much
<BR>
more responsive - NOT!).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Ten years ago this remark would have been on target. Five years ago the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; matter would have been arguable. Today it is simply ignorant prejudice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Microsoft's current performance in both these areas is in the top 25% of
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; industry, and still improving at a steady rate. They aren't the best in
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; world, but they are much better than average, and unless the Unix
</EM><BR>
vendors
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; get their collective act together they *will* be the best in another
</EM><BR>
five
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; years or so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...by virtue of having bought up or run out of business all competition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that did have their act together.
</EM><BR>
<P>As was demonstrated way back in the 19th century, it is not possible to
<BR>
drive competition out of a market simply by buying your competitors. If all
<BR>
you've got going for you is a big wallet, the smart thing for a
<BR>
newly-bought-out competitor to do is to use the money you paid him to start
<BR>
up another competing business. Then you buy that one, giving him an even
<BR>
bigger bankroll to use invest in his next business, and so until you either
<BR>
wise up or go broke.
<BR>
<P>No, the buy-out approach only works if the people getting your money don't
<BR>
want to be competing with you. Now, how do you convince people that they
<BR>
don't want to compete with you? Certainly not by throwing money at them! No,
<BR>
you do it by being a tough business rival - you have to be good at giving
<BR>
customers a product that they want at a price they are willing to pay. If
<BR>
you do that so well that your competitors don't think they can match you,
<BR>
they may just take their money and go play elsewhere.
