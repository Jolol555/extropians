<P><EM>&gt; What I forgot to mention is that we still have and use our VCR and DVD 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  players and a very well used Blockbuster Video account.  You don't need 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  cable to watch movies at home.  And, as I remember, the cable channels 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rarely showed the movies I wanted to see; and when they did the would 
</EM><BR>
replay 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  it over and over as if I really wanted to watch the same movie 5 times 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  within the same week.
</EM><BR>
<P>We recently got digital-cable-enabled in our neighborhood and I sprang for 
<BR>
the whole shebang on a trial basis.  The selection is now significantly 
<BR>
enhanced, such that we usually find more than one excellent offering 
<BR>
available at any one time.  As has been predicted, in fact, the diversity of 
<BR>
choices available has been somewhat daunting.
<BR>
<P>Also, as pretty avid cinemaphiles, Anthea and I tend to watch the movies we 
<BR>
find the most interesting quite a few times.  I'm sure you'd agree that a 
<BR>
great director or actor can create a work that can't really be grasped in 
<BR>
depth until it is experienced more than once.  Except for his last movie, 
<BR>
I've seen all of Kubrik's films MANY times (don't even ask how many times 
<BR>
I've seen &quot;2001&quot;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt;Oh - and fashion can be fun, too, you know.  It's nice to get dressed up 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;put on a show every once in a while.  We are monkey-men, after all, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;display and pageantry are also important means of expression.  Those great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;Texas philosophers, ZZ Top, were on to something, I think.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  To each his own.  I was thrilled the day I walked out of my office job, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  leaving my suits hanging in the closet at home.  They rarely get use 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  anymore, and that &quot;suits&quot; me just fine.  My idea of fashion is comfort, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  read: jeans, T-shirts and running shoes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have mixed feelings about this for myself.  &quot;Business casual&quot; is now 
<BR>
getting to be the norm even in stuffy &quot;big firms&quot; like mine.  We tend to 
<BR>
&quot;suit up&quot; only for actual courtroom work these days.  As social primates, 
<BR>
we're exquisitely tuned to send and receive visual signals among ourselves.  
<BR>
Complete &quot;casualization&quot; of our culture's wardrobe serves to decrease the 
<BR>
repertoire of available visual vocabulary, I think.  
<BR>
<P>I think there's some merit in having specialized wardrobes for specific 
<BR>
social functions, since it can serve to reinforce appropriate values for the 
<BR>
particular task at hand.  Thus, when an airline pilot puts on her uniform, I 
<BR>
think she's more likely to both perceive the importance of her own actions as 
<BR>
a pilot and also sends a signal to the passengers that she's a professional, 
<BR>
something I appreciate as a passenger.  I don't know if I'd like to board a 
<BR>
777 for a transatlantic flight and catch a glimpse of the pilot in cut-offs 
<BR>
and a t-shirt.
