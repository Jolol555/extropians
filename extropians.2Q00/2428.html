<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; Surveillance has *nothing* to do with freedom.  You are free now to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;No, of course not. Nothing at all. Slavery is freedom.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is like the umpteen millionth time someone has posted &quot;slavery is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom&quot; in these surveillance threads.  And it still has just as little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; persuasive power as the first time.  For the future, assume that everyone on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the list assumes that you have read _1984_.
</EM><BR>
<P>The question is, do you actually understand it? I don't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Currently, you can do a lot of perfectly innocuous, but illegal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;things, which won't result in any persecution, because no one will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ever find out about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly my point.  *All* criminals rationalize their crimes (&quot;I had to rob
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that store in order to survive&quot;; &quot;She deserved to be raped, look at the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; she was dressed&quot;; &quot;Of course I cheat on my taxes, I don't agree with what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Uncle Sam spends my money on&quot;, etc. etc.)  So merely because you rationalize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your crimes as being &quot;innocuous&quot; does not deprive them of their illegality.
</EM><BR>
<P>Innocuous meaning that they are victimless. Proper crime mandates that
<BR>
there be a victim. Prosecution of victimless crime is simply tyranny.
<BR>
The fact you won't identify yourself indicates that you have something
<BR>
to hide. A criminal record, perhaps? Maybe you are a politician or
<BR>
pundit whose actual goal is the institution of a 1984-like world
<BR>
government? Maybe you merely are a mental patient? 
<BR>
<P>Since we already know your first name is Michael, I can suggest a list
<BR>
of possible real names for you that would fit the statements you have
<BR>
made on this list:
<BR>
Michael Milken
<BR>
Michael Jackson
<BR>
Michael Tyson? (no, thats ludicrous...)
<BR>
Michael Kinsley (I definitely believe that one...fits his tyrannical
<BR>
self to a T, the only counter argument is that Michael Kinsley is far to
<BR>
busy a person to waste his time on this list...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Do you want to make many people miserable, you included? Then, vote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for transparent society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I, like most law-abiding citizens, have absolutely nothing to fear from a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transparent society.  If your deeds are good, you have no interest in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keeping them secret.  If you are willing to fight tooth and nail to keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your deeds hidden..., well do the math.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since you repeatedly refuse to disclose your real name on this list,
<BR>
when I and others have done so as a matter of standard practice, then
<BR>
you obviously have something to hide. You obviously beleive that this
<BR>
transparent society is meant for all the rest of us peons and not for
<BR>
someone like you.
