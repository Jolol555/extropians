<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is an entirely different issue from trademark law, and variants

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the USA but is widely recognized as having the weight of trademark
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; law elsewhere in the world).  Incidentally, it can be argued that those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Californian bubbly producers who call their produce Champagne have exactly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the same relationship to the real thing that Chinese software pirates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; have with Microsoft: they're simply infringing a form of intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; property that isn't recognized [much] in their home country.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Except that the people who originated appelation controlee are long dead, and Bill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Gates is quite alive.... a distinct difference.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh, indeed. (Speaking for myself, I'd rather it was the other way around;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I mean, given a choice between sharing the planet with most excellent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vintners and a marketing guy with a whiny voice, I don't think it's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult choice ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However I should not that the people who originated copyright and patent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law are also long dead. Does this mean we should ditch them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>No, appelation contrelee is a process, a standard of quality that is
<BR>
protected by intellectual property law in France. It is not covered
<BR>
however, by the IP sections of the GATT treaty, and therefore has no
<BR>
international weight. Now, saying you are appelation controlee is a big
<BR>
difference from saying &quot;produit du Champagne&quot; (or however it should be
<BR>
spelled), much as saying that your maple syrup meets the Vermont organic
<BR>
maple syrup standards, versus saying your maple syrup was organically
<BR>
grown in Vermont to the OMS standard. Anyone can make maple syrup that
<BR>
meets the VOMS standard, and can therefore put an 'organic' label on
<BR>
their maple syrup. The point of difficulty is with whether place names
<BR>
like Champagne or Vermont are more well known as product types, or as
<BR>
geographic regions. If the more common definition is as a product type,
<BR>
then any geographic restrictions should not really hold.
