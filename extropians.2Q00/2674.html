<EM>&gt; SOURCE:   'The Mail on Sunday' May 7 2000:

<EM>&gt; Dr Patrick Moore, the academic and renowned ecologist, was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a founder member of Greenpeace, and later became its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; president. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Two points to note for those who aren't intimately familiar with the
<BR>
British media ...
<BR>
<P>Firstly, the Mail on Sunday is the Sunday edition of the Daily Mail,
<BR>
probably the most right-wing (in a reactionary sense -- they're not
<BR>
exactly libertarian!) newspaper in the UK. (I'm talking xenophobic
<BR>
little-englanders here.) Their editorial attitude to Greenpeace is
<BR>
symptomatic of their attitude to _anyone_ who questions the Establishment;
<BR>
rather than examining issues on their merit, the Mail will examine issues
<BR>
on the basis of whether or not great-grandpa would have felt comfortable
<BR>
with them. It's almost as if the entire newspaper was placed in cryonic
<BR>
suspension in the 1920's and has just been decanted, angry and bewildered,
<BR>
in a century it doesn't understand. In fact, expecting a pro-Greenpeace
<BR>
article -- or even an unbiased one! -- from the Mail on Sunday would be
<BR>
a bit like expecting the Washington Post to feature a topless babe on
<BR>
Page Three and advocate compulsory nationalisation of industries without
<BR>
compensation in the business section.
<BR>
<P>Secondly, Patrick Moore, although a great media personality (and
<BR>
presenter of one of the world's longest-running weekly TV shows, &quot;The
<BR>
Sky at Night&quot;, on BBC TV) is noted for being somewhat on the barking mad
<BR>
fringe, politically. (According to a friend of mine who's worked with
<BR>
him, &quot;the BBC just takes care not to let him talk about anything except
<BR>
astronomy. And glockenspiels. And penguins.&quot;) If I remember correctly,
<BR>
his take on Margaret Thatcher was that she was a dangerous pinko commie
<BR>
leftist who was far too soft on immigration issues that would lead to
<BR>
Britain Drowning in a Sea of Darkies(TM).
<BR>
<P>I draw no conclusions for you about the accuracy of Patrick Moore's
<BR>
opinions on Greenpeace other than to point out that both he, and the
<BR>
newspaper he writes in, have a whole bushel of political axes to grind.
