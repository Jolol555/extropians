<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - Although I am not aware of any particular progress towards this goal, it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; makes perfect sense that soon, physical birth will be a thing of the past. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's dangerous, takes up a lot of time and energy, and I hear that it really 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hurts too. If I see a company which is making any progress towards womb-less 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; birth (via some kind of incubator), I'm going to invest my life savings. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't at first. While I agree that in vitro wombs make excellent
<BR>
sense (once the technology is developed far enough) *rationally*,
<BR>
childbearing is an intensely emotional, (dare I say it?) spiritual and
<BR>
socioculturally enmeshed affair that radical changes of it will at
<BR>
best take time. There will likely be some demand for it, and it might
<BR>
increase over time, but I wouldn't expect a sizeable group of parents
<BR>
immediately adopting it. It is something new, possibly frightening,
<BR>
expensive and lacks the emotional buffering caused by a traditional
<BR>
pregnancy. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What this means for human evolution is a massive increase in brain size. The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only thing limiting the brain size right now is the narrowness of the birth 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; canal. Intelligence is a valuable survival trait, and that's why it's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetically worth the increase in childbirth deaths that humans experience. 
</EM><BR>
<P>While larger skulls could allow larger brains and brainsize does
<BR>
correlate a bit with intelligence test results, in vitro wombs
<BR>
themselves do not enable any intelligence increase. Some genetic
<BR>
modification or hormone treatment could of course increase brain size,
<BR>
but it should be noted that the birth canal is not the only limiting
<BR>
factor. Energy demands can be quite critical in thinking, and I have
<BR>
begun to form the impression from my readings on glucose enhancements
<BR>
of cognition that local shortages develop with our current brains. A
<BR>
larger brain would need more energy and oxygen, and this in turn has
<BR>
to be supplied by the cardiovascular system - and here scaling laws
<BR>
might complicate things a lot. Not to mention the musculoskeletal
<BR>
system of the neck.  Just increasing brain size is not going to cut
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>One advantage which may play a significant role is health. Most likely
<BR>
many of the genes found correlating with intelligence really code for
<BR>
good health or resistance against childhood diseases that slow or
<BR>
impair cognitive development slightly. If in vitro wombs could provide
<BR>
an environment where infections, birth traumas and later diseases
<BR>
could be prevented (in utero vaccination?), then that would already
<BR>
lead to a measurable intelligence increase IMHO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - It is possible to seperate X-chromosome bearing sperm from Y-chromosome 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bearing sperm in a test tube, thus making it possible to choose the gender 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of your child (and I think it is even being practiced somewhat). In many 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cultures, female children are not valued as much as men children. The fear 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of this technology is based on the fact that it will skew gender populations 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as almost everyone chooses to have male children. I would not expect this to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be widespread at least in US culture, although a 60/40 skew is not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unimagineable. In extreme male-supremecist cultures like that being endorsed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Afghanistan, I would expect a 90/10 skew. The short term, social effects 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of this would be bad. I'd expect to see an intensification of attitudes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which treat women as property. Long term and biologically, I'd expect to see 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a general increase in any ability which has to do with survival, health, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wealth accumulation, and attracting a mate. The reason for this is that if 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only 10% of the population were female, only 20% of the population would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; breed. With the roughly 50/50 mix we have now, anyone who is fertile can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a child. The &quot;most fit&quot; males and females hookup with eachother, as do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;least fit&quot; males and females. If only 11% of the male population was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; breeding, the &quot;least fit&quot; 89% would be weeded out. In this case, whether 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;fit&quot; in the Darwinian sense correlates with good or desirable in the moral 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sense is debatable.
</EM><BR>
<P>You assume several things here that I find doubtful. 
<BR>
<P>First is that a gender inbalance would reinforce the misogynic
<BR>
tendencies, when it could just as well lead to an increased value of
<BR>
women.
<BR>
<P>Second, you assume that fit individuals in a population where few can
<BR>
reproduce will hook up with each other. First, fitness in an
<BR>
evolutionary sense (many grandchildren) have little to do with
<BR>
survival, health and wealth accumulation today - it would be the
<BR>
people who reproduced more that would be the winners, and as a general
<BR>
rule the higher the level of education and social status in modern
<BR>
societies the fewer kids on average. Second, you assume that in this
<BR>
scenario the good properties would be significantly inhereited
<BR>
(genetically or memetically) - this may hold only for some
<BR>
properties. Third, it assumes that only the best mate with the best,
<BR>
which is also not necessarily true.
