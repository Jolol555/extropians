<P><EM> &gt; Getting through the skull is a minor problem I presume...  Or have
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; you removed the brain and spine???
</EM><BR>
<P>Cutting is a seriusly bad idea (if you really want it, then why not
<BR>
LN-cooled isotopically pure diamond knifes? ;) -- you wouldn't want to
<BR>
cut a platter full of porridge, wouldn't you? I recommend going to
<BR>
your local slaughterperson, and obtain a relatively fresh animal
<BR>
brain. Try moving it, and handling it. It does really tell you a lot
<BR>
more than theoretizing about an object one has never held in one's
<BR>
hands.
<BR>
<P>Of course, one can dremel the skull open after perfusion with
<BR>
cryoprotectants, but it's tedious (=slow, and can be a source of
<BR>
mechanical injury), and the brain will tend to deform under its own
<BR>
weight because of lack of floatation due to absence of
<BR>
liquor. (Dremelling in a vat of liquid is a nighmare, at least for
<BR>
current humans -- sonar/touch guided robots might be different, but
<BR>
who's going to develop them?). It takes forever, is surprisingly
<BR>
messy, but is probably useful if you want to vitrify the brain
<BR>
(viscosity will soon prevent you from anything put passive thermal
<BR>
conduction cooldown).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
If there is really a threshold where current vitrification agents
<BR>
can't cool down human sized brain cleanly before massive nucleation
<BR>
occurs (I'm only talking about vitrification here, obviously), you
<BR>
could always attempt to bisect it *very* carefully. But, I don't think
<BR>
this is an issue at all. Use conservative approach, unless it's
<BR>
obviously failing. Do not hurt the patient unnecessarily, that's what
<BR>
experimental animals are for.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I doubt the cooling rate matters much.  There is still residual brain
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; activity in comatose patients or patients who have been dead for hours.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, your EEG is sure flat &lt;20 s after you arrest. At that point
<BR>
you've burned all your local ATP and the oxygen.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Since the brain is sterile you aren't going to have bacteria consuming
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; anything (as would be the case in the gut).  Since you are out of ATP
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; you can't do any breakdown (or construction) that requires energy.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; So so long as the non-energy requiring enzymes in compartments like
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the lysosomes remain in their compartments, not much is going to happen.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Ideally, there should be no arrest. (Of course that's currently quite
<BR>
illegal, so we're being purely theoretical here). You would want to
<BR>
keep perfusability as long as possible. For instance, as soon as you
<BR>
run out of ATP (abovementioned ~20 sec), cells can't maintain ion
<BR>
equilibrium, and tissue suddenly start to swell, ruining your
<BR>
perfusion infrastructure by closing up capillaries and vessels. There
<BR>
are subjective differences, but from a certain minimal duration the
<BR>
patient has clotted (unless given heparine etc. before the event), and
<BR>
you just can't perfuse. Then, straight freeze is your only
<BR>
hope. Personally I think that's snake oil, but that's just me.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; The only caveat here is whether the accumulation of CO2 in the brain
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; lowers the pH enough to create an acidic enough environment outside
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the lysosomes to activate the enzymes that haven't been delivered
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to those organelles yet.  [An area where the people interested
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in Cryonics should do some further study.]
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting thought. Of course, pH is being homeostated if you keep
<BR>
you on life support, as you should. Apparently, the gut/mucosa suffers
<BR>
extensive damage during ischaemia, which really limits sustained
<BR>
recovery. You can't impress the mainstream with excellent structural
<BR>
preservation if your animal is very dead.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I don't disagree that the razor-blade approach might cool things faster
</EM><BR>
<P>With most recent (research-grade, patients must pass for now)
<BR>
protocols cooling at least rabbit-head samples to vitrify
<BR>
quantitatively appears to be very possible. As a litmus test,
<BR>
rewarming shows surprisingly little nucleation. Huge progress is being
<BR>
made recently in R&amp;D, purportedly technology transfer is progressing
<BR>
without too much red tape, so let's keep our fingers crossed.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; and the computer probably could stick things back together, it seems
</EM><BR>
<P>Sticking them together is not a problem, but your interfaces are all
<BR>
mush (=information erasure). Why, if you don't have to?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; better however to keep the ultrastructure as intact as possible even
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; at the expense of a lower cooling rate, unless severe extralysosomal
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; degradation is occuring.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cooling down buys you time. After you go way below zero, you have to
<BR>
be quick, or things start to nucleate. So, there are two phases.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; It isn't the blood(O2/glucose)-loss that damages the brain, its
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the resupplying of energy resulting in excitotoxicity within the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; neurons causing them to lose control of ion storage and really
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh yes, EEG goes all wild if you reperfuse an ischaemically damaged
<BR>
brain. Because of this, you have to inhibit self-destructive activity
<BR>
by using a plethora of drugs as well as hypothermy.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; make a mess of things (I'm sure Anders could provide a more
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; technical explanation -- there is probably several sites on the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; net that discuss this as well).  Since brain reanimation will be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; a carefully controlled process, this is unlikely to occur.  We
</EM><BR>
<P>No one is going to reperfuse, and reanimate. You'd want to stay in
<BR>
solid state as long as possible, because if things start to flow you
<BR>
lose control. In theory, you can disassemble the patient, remove
<BR>
artefacts with a digital filter on the fly, add fractal retractable
<BR>
heat exchanger, and then rebuild the whole thing. However, technology
<BR>
as advanced as that means there is no point in reviving the patient,
<BR>
just upload him, and save resources. Running a whole ecosphere bubble
<BR>
in slowtime is expensive.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; may have drugs within the next 5-10 years that suppress this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; situation and in the more distant future nanobots within or around
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; neurons can obviously handle the problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>We do have very nifty drugs already, but you really need to
<BR>
pre/postmedicate the patient, and do not allow any noticeable
<BR>
ischaemic damage to occur. Ideally, cryonics procedures should take
<BR>
over with no hiatus when classical medicine fails. In many cases,
<BR>
euthanasia does really make sense, I really hope future legislation
<BR>
will address that, despite current trend to overregulation and a
<BR>
society *still* growing litigation-happy year by year.
