<EM>&gt;     This is what on the face of it seems a cut and dry issue. Criminals want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to hide and the law abiding citizen has no need to fear constant survailence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hmmmm....
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that given the current state of government and society is
<BR>
that 99% of us break a law at least once or twice a week, if not every
<BR>
day several times.  You literally have to be in a coma to not break one
<BR>
or more government regulations through the course of your day, and its
<BR>
only getting worse, not better. The same sort of people who are
<BR>
screaming for ubiquitous surveillance are also the sort of people who
<BR>
are always saying &quot;there should be a law against this or that behavior&quot;.
<BR>
They are incessant busybodies who think people are no damn good and need
<BR>
to be told what to do for their own good. I would not mind ubiquitous
<BR>
surveillance at all if there were only, say, TEN laws in existence, and
<BR>
if it were a widespread cultural more that anything else a person does
<BR>
is no damn business of yours.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Im not convinced either way. I have been thinking about Transparency in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one form another for several years and my viewpoint has swayed from For to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Against many times.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     My current mindset is that in general survailence is primarily good, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I still have reservations. I would like the peace of mind that if we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under constant scrutiny that this will in someway make me feel safer. Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would i need to worry about being mugged if a potentail assailent knew his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actions would be monitored and therefor he has a high risk of being caught.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He is likely not to bother as the risk will be too great. likewise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Burgulars,Car Theives and many other criminals. But then there is still the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Complete Nutter&quot; who would happily stab you if front of 1000 people so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survailence is not likey to stop this breed of people.
</EM><BR>
<P>THey are likely to use a surveillance system to track you down as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     I know for sure that In certain circumstances I would not like my every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; move to be monitored. I don't like the idea that survailence monitoring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personel might be sitting there laughing and calling over their colegues to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; watch me scratch my arse or worse !. Or that a tape of my actions could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circulating giving people a good laugh.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I can see that with out a doubt the system will be missused. Im sure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market researchers would pay the earth to monitor consumer and really see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what Joe average gets up to in his everyday life.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the surveillance system protecting me belongs to me, is under my
<BR>
control, is automated AI that recognises threats and dangers to me and
<BR>
my family, and is not penetrable by outside individuals, then I have no
<BR>
trouble with it, as it is a private security/surveillance system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     On a slightly different note but very related. One thing I have thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about considerably is the Tagging of the general population. By this you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably guessed I mean Subcutanious Data transmitters giving the identity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and location of any individual.
</EM><BR>
<P>Currently undergoing proof of concept trials with the dogs in your
<BR>
community (which is also meant to get the economies of scale up enough
<BR>
so there can be no economic objections to adopting it for people). Next
<BR>
will be your kids getting them 'for their own protection'. Then old
<BR>
people will get them as a condition of living in retirement communities,
<BR>
then large corporate employers will require them as a security badge....
<BR>
<P>Don't worry folks, Harry Tuttle (of Brazil fame) here to help free you
<BR>
from the system...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     I can see Incredible potential for devices like these. Imagine a scenario
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where someone is lost in mountainous terrain, Under an avalanche, at sea, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the desert, missing children etc etc . No doubt if this system was ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developed the data would be saved, this would be an exceptional crime
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fighting tool. No more false allabies. You could keep constant track off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prisoners and people on parole. Obviously these devices could be tampered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with or removed so doing either would probably be a criminal offence.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, you get arrested and while you are in jail they drug you and
<BR>
implant a chip with the incriminating evidence on it...
