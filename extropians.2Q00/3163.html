<P><EM>&gt; Dreams have content. That content must come from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  somewhere. A given theory of dream interpretation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  might be total rubbish, but it is obvious that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the content of dreams reflect in some way the content
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of the mind of the dreamer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Regardless of how kooky his theories might have been,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Freud was a pioneer in that he attempted to apply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a scientific spirit to the interpretation of dreams
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to learn something about the unconscious contents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of the mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think his downfall was to force his own personal interpretation on the 
<BR>
contents of other peoples dreams. Only the dreamer knows the proper 
<BR>
interpretation, which is purely relevant to their own experience and thought 
<BR>
process. I have had many frightening dreams of war and haulacaust. Freud may 
<BR>
well have interpreted these as repressed aggression or sexual desire whereas 
<BR>
I know this is due to my deep rooted fear and loathing of war.

<EM>&gt;  * If the dreamer HADN'T heard of Washington and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  his crossing of the Delaware, you'd have to start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  wondering about that collective unconscious stuff.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ive already put my head on the block about that one. :o)
