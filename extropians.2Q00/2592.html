<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, the answer is obvious: one consciousness stream might not be aware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of another similar consciousness stream, but &quot;you&quot; (the collective bounded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by the predicate &quot;is Harvey Newstrom&quot;) are necessarily aware of all of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;you&quot; simultaneously.  You(1) are aware of you(1), you(2) are aware of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you(2), so some member of you is aware of you(1), and some member of you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is aware of you(2).  So &quot;you&quot; are aware of all of you, even on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;adjective&quot; view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is where it becomes completely UNobvious to me.  You can define
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the self anyway you like, but my definition is the self-aware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness who says &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I see that you want full access to all parts of your consciousness,
<BR>
and that one consciousness stream does not have full access to the other.
<BR>
<P>The problem here is that you're not quite playing my game.  Under my
<BR>
definition, you DO have access to every part of yourself, and you DO think
<BR>
to yourself that &quot;I think therefore I am.&quot;  &quot;You,&quot; under my definition, DO
<BR>
have access to every consciousness stream that is you, DESPITE the fact
<BR>
that some of your parts aren't aware of the others, because &quot;you&quot; are the
<BR>
set containing ALL of the consciousness streams.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any thoughts being generated which are not accessible by me are not my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thoughts and are not coming from me.
</EM><BR>
<P>True.  But is it true under my definition that the thoughts of some
<BR>
consciousness streams are not accessible by &quot;you?&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If you can't feel your hand, does that mean the hand isn't part of you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The hand is not part of my consciousness.  It indeed can be deleted without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; killing me. It is my consiousness that I do not want deleted.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I had something else in mind, but it's not a very good point, so
<BR>
I'll cede this one to you. ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Ahem.  You have it as a goal to preserve your &quot;self,&quot; but you have chosen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to define &quot;self&quot; as consciousness stream.  I'm arguing that this was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mistake, that you'd be better served with another definition.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No.  I do not choose to preserve my self no matter what that self
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; turns out to be.  I choose to preserve my current consciousness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stream.  I think you believe that I am trying to preserve my &quot;self&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but have a mistaken belief of what that is.  My goal is to continue my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current consciousness stream.  Even if evolution, growth or other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; events define it to no longer be &quot;me&quot;, that is what I choose to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preserve.  I would even prefer to have my memory wiped and my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness continue rather than delete this consciousness and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; create a new one with all my memories.  I would like to preserve my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memories, but my definition of life is not based on the past.  It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based on the future.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oookaaay.  Allow me to try again.
<BR>
<P>You're right.  You're not too keen on preserving &quot;self&quot; as such.  My
<BR>
error.  Instead, you're interested in avoiding your own &quot;death,&quot; whatever
<BR>
THAT turns out to be.  My argument can be fully restated in terms of you
<BR>
being mistaken about what &quot;death&quot; is rather than being mistaken about the
<BR>
&quot;self.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A quickie to see what that argument would be like.  You're interested in
<BR>
preserving your consciousness stream because that's what you think
<BR>
&quot;avoiding death&quot; is.  But there's no experiment that would show us whether
<BR>
you're right that &quot;death&quot; is characterized by a stunted consciousness
<BR>
stream, or whether it's when happens when your copy set from turns out
<BR>
empty, or what.  So WE, as rational thinkers participating in language,
<BR>
have to decide what &quot;avoiding death&quot; is.  With that being said, we should
<BR>
do our defining with all of our goals in mind, and it's pretty clear to me
<BR>
that if your goal is to &quot;avoid death&quot; but not (intrinsically) to avoid
<BR>
stunting consciousness streams, you'll be better served defining &quot;death&quot;
<BR>
as an empty copy set, rather than as a stunting of your current
<BR>
consciousness stream.
<BR>
<P>Now, you might nonetheless insist that you DO take it as an intrinsic goal
<BR>
that you should avoid stunting consciousness streams.  If so, I really
<BR>
can't convince you.  But I doubt that you do hold the view quite that way.
<BR>
I suspect that you instead hold the view that you ought to avoid death,
<BR>
and you also hold the view that if your current consciousness stream ends,
<BR>
you die, and that you should THEREFORE avoid ending the consciousness
<BR>
stream.  Thus, preserving your consciousness stream is probably extrinsic,
<BR>
at least in the respect that you could decide to discard it if you had a
<BR>
different view on what death is.  Moreover, I argue, I bet it's compatible
<BR>
with all of the intrinsic goals you actually have to define death
<BR>
differently.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Genetics have little value to me.  I think people are too carried away in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to preserve their DNA.  If I could be uploaded into a robot without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DNA, that would be great.  My decision to die for my brother would be based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on life-long familiarity with him.  I am familiar with my friends and my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current consciousness stream as well.  I would not be as likely to die for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brother I never knew existed or a clone I had never previously met or a copy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who wanted to replace me.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;blink blink&gt; Are you going to try to argue with me that you would have
<BR>
little familiarity with an *exact copy of yourself*???  I can understand
<BR>
why you might think that at first.  &quot;Hey, who's this guy, he looks like
<BR>
me, but other than that, I don't really know him.&quot;  But talk to him for a
<BR>
few minutes and you'd quickly find that you know him quite well, as well
<BR>
as you know yourself.  (Which, poetic considerations aside, is quite well
<BR>
indeed.)  Really, imagine having a conversation like this, and you might
<BR>
see what I mean.  Imagine somebody who's literally lived your own life,
<BR>
shares all of your beliefs, asks all the same questions, loves all the
<BR>
same music; this guy, who knows you as well as all of your friends and
<BR>
your loved ones, remembers your first kiss (as well as you do, anyway). He
<BR>
remembers your biggest successes and your worst failures as if he was
<BR>
actually there, along with every other important defining event in your
<BR>
entire life.  Are you going to tell me that you would have NO familiarity
<BR>
with this man?  Or little more than a stranger?  I think you'd know him
<BR>
BETTER than you know your twin.
<BR>
<P>As for not being willing to die for a copy who WANTED to *replace* you, if
<BR>
my &quot;copy&quot; turned out like that, I'd be quite skeptical that it was really
<BR>
a copy after all.  Don't forget that your copy would have all the same
<BR>
motivations as you, and all the concern for you that you would have for
<BR>
him.  (Yes, that includes not being willing to die for you if you wouldn't
<BR>
be willing to die for him.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Some people would require a perfect memory from their previous body, or they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would consider themselves dead.  Some people would require the same body, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they would consider themselves dead.  Some people would require physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sensations and/or qualia or they would consider themselves dead.  Some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people would require a continued consciousness stream.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why did you decide to make an ending consciousness stream death?  I
<BR>
understand why you want to avoid death.  By why did you decide to make
<BR>
THAT death?  More to the point, why not make it &quot;having an empty copy set&quot;
<BR>
instead?
