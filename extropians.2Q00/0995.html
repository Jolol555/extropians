<EM>&gt; Jesus, this is frustrating.  What do you think we've been doing for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 20 years?  Do you think we haven't been trying like hell to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _allowed_ in the debates?  Do you think we haven't been sending
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; releases to the press every week for years?  Do you think we haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been using paper, the web, and every other medium available to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the message out?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From personal experience?  No.  Or rather, yes, but ineffectively
</EM><BR>
enough that it might as well be no, which is part of the problem, and I
<BR>
have seen how these media are used.  See below.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It doesn't matter that nearly every radio talk show host in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; country hs called or including the LP in debates.  It doesn't matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that most newspapers have as well.  It doesn't matter that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; league of women voters (who used to sponsor the big debate) called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for inclusion.  The Ds &amp; Rs took over the process and created the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;non-partisan&quot; commission on debates specifically for the partisan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purpose of keeping out the LP, and as long as the television network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; media let them get away with it, it will work.
</EM><BR>
<P>It sounds like the ones you need to work on here aren't the D/Rs, but
<BR>
the television networks themselves.  For instance, if you can document
<BR>
how non-D/R candidates are systematically barred (and you probably can),
<BR>
*especially* if you can give it the stench of illegality (this might be
<BR>
a bit more difficult), it might make for a good 60 Minutes story.  If
<BR>
the D/Rs won't acknowledge your existence, create controversy - which
<BR>
the media *will* lap up - until they do.  (Take as an example Perot's
<BR>
'92 shot, which started in basically your situation - with more money,
<BR>
perhaps, but probably not with as much political experience - and got on
<BR>
the public radar.)  Either way, you get the message that you exist into
<BR>
the public consciousness.
<BR>
<P>Examine the potential gain in publicity versus cost for each medium, and
<BR>
each use of the medium.  You have limited resources, so concentrate your
<BR>
resources on the high-yield media.  At least, that would seem to be one
<BR>
way out...
