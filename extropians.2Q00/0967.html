</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; You gotta be joking.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You are making the infounded assumpution that it is a finite or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; practically finite resources. This is an incorrect assumption.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Uh-huh. You've just _asserted_ that it's an incorrect assumption. We're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sitting on a planet that masses about 10^27 kilograms. I'd say that puts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a fairly clear cap on any particular resource that's embedded in our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planetary crust!
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats why I said PRACTICALLY FINITE. If the singularity comes before
<BR>
we've used it all up, then it might as well have been infinite, right?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Facetiousness aside, your point about the methane hydrates, Atlantic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fields, and so on, is taken. However, there are two problems with taking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it at face value:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Firstly, petrochemicals _can_ be extracted from these deposits, albeit at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a cost greater than today's oil price. However, the price of oil is dictated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to some extent by demand, which in turn depends on how useful the stuff is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to us. If it costs $1000 in today's terms to extract a barrel of oil, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I very much doubt that anybody would consider burning it for energy. Other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy sources will be around, and cheaper, at that price. As a bottom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; line, it doesn't make sense to extract petroleum for fuel when the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy cost of extracting it exceeds the energy it contains (plus any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other intangibles, like the fact that it's readily transportable).
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course. There are plenty of other alternatives out there, and the
<BR>
sooner we stop burning the stuff off the better. Oil should really only
<BR>
be used for making composite and polymer materials. As soon as the price
<BR>
per barrel raises the energy cost of oil based energy production above
<BR>
about $0.12-0.25 per Kwh, you will see it being replaced by many other
<BR>
sources, from nuclear, to wind, and solar. Solar PV roof shingles have
<BR>
been trying to come on the market for 8 years now, but are still not
<BR>
cost effective in 99% of all applications due to the alternative (oil)
<BR>
cost curve being where it is.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Secondly, if you keep on burning this stuff we ultimately run up against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a different limit: oxygen. Believe it or not, it's possible to admit that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we _do_ inhabit a planet where the oxygen mostly gets generated by C3 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; C4 photosynthesis cycle organisms, which in turn get their ATP by devious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; means from sunlight. This may strike you as a reductio ad absurdam, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even if our planet's mantle is swimming in dissolved hydrocarbons, there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a limit to our ability to oxidize them without fucking over our breathing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mixture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, its quite evident from the evidence at hand that nature in
<BR>
some areas is stepping up to the plate to absorb this. The forestation
<BR>
levels for North America, for instance are up some huge amount since the
<BR>
turn of the century, and apparently our natural resources actually
<BR>
absorb as much carbon emissions as we produce here, making N.A. a near
<BR>
zero net producer of carbon based emissions. If other areas can do the
<BR>
same...  The main net contributors to carbon pollution are mostly China,
<BR>
Japan, and Europe. This being said, you are overestimating by a huge
<BR>
amount the percentage of the atmosphere that humans can modify with
<BR>
pollution. CO2 is a very, very minor part of the atmospheric mix. It is
<BR>
up by some 30% over this past century though, with no ill effects, and
<BR>
further increases have a diminishing impact upon the greenhouse effect
<BR>
as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There won't be a shortage, this is bull. The market will finally meet the demand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at a market determined price, not a producer determined price. If the british
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oil unions go out of work, well, I won't cry for them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; There ain't no such animals; just high-tech companies that specialise in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; extracting oil from under half a mile of frigid and turbulent ocean.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Good, so answer my other point.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What other point -- that we should all bow down before the holy market,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because the invisible hand knows best?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Markets are a _tool_, Mike. We use them because they work, and they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remarkably flexible and general -- but like all tools, they have their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limits. I don't buy your religious belief that because you understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how a hammer works, it follows that all problems are nails. From the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outside, you'd be surprised how similar market fundamentalists look to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christian fundamentalists, or _any_ other followers of irrational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orthodoxy. Whether the followers reflect the veracity of their belief
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system accurately is, of course, another matter: but it's not a promising
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start.
</EM><BR>
<P>Markets have limits at any given point in time. What amazes me about the
<BR>
chicken littles is that they can't imagine the future market growing to
<BR>
the point where such things are possible. I'll bet you right now that by
<BR>
2050, the price of oil will be around $100 per barrel, and nobody will
<BR>
think that is especially expensive at all. Do you know how much oil is
<BR>
recoverable at that rate? About 300-400 years worth at current
<BR>
consumption rates.
