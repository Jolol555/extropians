<P>I've been thinking about wearing a permanent &quot;wire&quot; and
<BR>
archiving my conversations.  I'm not sure how much storage
<BR>
I'll need for the compressed voice data, but I'm fairly
<BR>
certain the size/cost of memory will easily keep up with the
<BR>
amount of data I could produce per year.  Also, there's the
<BR>
question of security - perhaps, if anyone else is interested
<BR>
in doing this, we could create a &quot;trust group&quot; to trade keys
<BR>
to the encrypted data (which could be kept on a secure
<BR>
server).  On the same server copies of all correspodences,
<BR>
usenet and mailing list posts, academic papers, old school
<BR>
books, childhood drawings, financial records, and so on,
<BR>
could also be kept (again, encrypted with keys going to
<BR>
other members of the trust group).
