<EM>&gt; Let me restate my question without all the baggage.  What exactly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would this coding cortext do?  How powerful is it supposed to be?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How intelligent?  The document is not very clear about these points.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since IMO none of the answers to this question have been very informative, I
<BR>
decided to take a shot at it.
<BR>
<P>An AI without a codic cortex would write code the dame way a human
<BR>
programmer does, using high-level conscious thought for every step of the
<BR>
process. It would examine the results of its work the way humans do, using
<BR>
very indirect interfaces and many levels of lossy symbolic transformation
<BR>
between the visible code and actual machine behavior. It would design
<BR>
systems by trying to 'visualize' the interactions between components, just
<BR>
like we do.  And so on.
<BR>
<P>Adding a codic cortex to this AI is simply an evolutionary process of
<BR>
replacing these techniques with more effective specialized software. Give
<BR>
the AI a dedicated system for modeling software components, instead of
<BR>
trying to use a visual system designed for actual physical objects. Add a
<BR>
facility for converting machine code to software representations, instead of
<BR>
relying on human-readable source code. Give it a library of code generators
<BR>
for common tasks, and an extensible architecture so it can write new ones
<BR>
for itself.
<BR>
<P>There are also less coding-specific changes that would yield big
<BR>
improvements in coding ability. Simply allocating a few gigabytes of
<BR>
high-reliability storage to memorizing the exact behavior of all its
<BR>
development tools would cut out a lot of wasted time compared to humans.
<BR>
Allocating more space to short-term memory (so the AI can think about more
<BR>
than 5-7 distinct 'things' at once) would be another big improvement.
<BR>
<P>Now, before Eugene jumps on me, allow me to point out that evolutionary
<BR>
approaches can also be incorporated in such a system.  A full-featured codic
<BR>
cortex should include a pretty elaborate GA system for evolving software
<BR>
components, as well as (ideally) a relatively automatic facility for
<BR>
converting specs into fitness functions. Better yet, you could have a
<BR>
library of different systems, all attempting to evolve useful bits of code
<BR>
in different ways, and a meta-system which allocates run time between them
<BR>
based on their track record for various types of problems.
<BR>
<P>Now, obviously, it would take a huge amount of work to create such an
<BR>
elaborate piece of software. But it isn't an all-or-nothing proposition -
<BR>
you can add individual refinements one at a time, and each of them will
<BR>
contribute somewhat to improved coding ability. At the beginning of the
<BR>
process you have a very human-like AI that writes human-like source code at
<BR>
a human-like rate. At the end of it you have an alien mind that uses
<BR>
specialized facilities to write incomprehensibly complex machine code
<BR>
several orders of magnitude faster.
