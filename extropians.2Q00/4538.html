<P>
Just wondering if anyone else has had a chance to read John Colapinto's
<BR>
fascinating, heartbreaking (and rhetorically loaded) book AS NATURE MADE
<BR>
HIM, about the famous case of the twin boy who lost his penis during a
<BR>
botched circumcision, was then castrated, surgically sex-reassigned and
<BR>
raised as a girl. His sponsor, Doc Money, claimed for years this was a
<BR>
triumph of adaptation. It became the classic instance cited endlesly in
<BR>
feminist and poststrucural `social construction' texts and courses. In
<BR>
fact, the poor kid was a psychological mess, and finally came out in
<BR>
adolescence as a male (and now married, with adopted kids). 
<BR>
<P>The argument urged in the book (so far; I'm only halfway thru) is what
<BR>
seems to me the obvious one: once the brain has been dimorphised into the
<BR>
male developmental cascade in utero and infancy, nurture can't re-set all
<BR>
the implicit behavioral templates, or many of the physiological ones, even
<BR>
in the absence of testicles. 
<BR>
<P>This case, however, fails to address the matter of eunuchs and more
<BR>
especially castrati, where I assume boy singers were lopped exactly because
<BR>
their voices thereafter mostly retained their soprano beauty (unlike
<BR>
Brenda/David, whose voice changed without added hormones). My working guess
<BR>
is that the history of castrati we see might be the result of several
<BR>
intervening filter effects: say, the sweetest singers are those boys
<BR>
already (somewhat) feminised in utero; the only castrati who make it into
<BR>
the annals are the ones who voices don't inconveniently crack anyway, the
<BR>
rest being chucked out...
<BR>
<P>In particular, I'd like to hear Loree Thomas's take on this.
<BR>
