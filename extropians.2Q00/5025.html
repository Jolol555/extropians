New York Times Magazine
<BR>
June 11, 2000
<BR>
<P>For the past four years, a group of writers and researchers has compiled
<BR>
the Dead Media Project, an online archive of obsolete technology started
<BR>
by two science-fiction writers, Richard Kadrey and Bruce Sterling. &quot;The
<BR>
future arrives through novelty,&quot; Sterling says. &quot;We recognize a new period
<BR>
by its technical accomplishments. But the character of everyday life is
<BR>
also influenced by the absence of things.&quot; Kadrey adds: &quot;We're probably
<BR>
generating more dead media than at any other moment in history. This is
<BR>
the golden age of cool junk. To understand this is to think differently
<BR>
about where we are and where we're going.&quot; Herewith, a brief sampling of
<BR>
the working list. 
<BR>
<P>RAMELLI'S BOOK WHEEL: The first workstation for scholars, this
<BR>
16th-century machine was for &quot;anyone who takes pleasure in study,
<BR>
especially those indisposed by gout.&quot; A scholar could stand in front of a
<BR>
Ferris wheel-like device from which eight lecterns holding books were
<BR>
suspended, and, by spinning a series of gears, bring a lectern and book of
<BR>
choice up right in front of him. 
<BR>
<P>THE CAT PIANO: Originated in Brussels in 1549, designed to be played by a
<BR>
bear. Inside the instrument were 20 cats, each with a cord tied around its
<BR>
tail. As the bear pounded the keys, the cords were pulled -- yanking the
<BR>
cats' tails and causing them to meow. 
<BR>
<P>THE TELHARMONIUM: A mammoth electrical generating plant and distribution
<BR>
system, invented by Thaddeus Cahill at the end of the 19th century,
<BR>
designed to provide music over telephone lines. The telharmonium's signals
<BR>
tended to overwhelm telephone switching systems and cause them to blow
<BR>
out. 
<BR>
<P>THE ZENITH PHONEVISION: For 90 straight days in 1951, Zenith broadcast
<BR>
Hollywood motion pictures to families, to be watched on their televisions.
<BR>
A coin-operated box, placed on top of the TV, retrieved decoding
<BR>
information over the phone line and unscrambled Zenith's broadcast signal.
<BR>
But viewers watched 1.73 movies per week, not enough to justify a
<BR>
continued commercial venture. 
<BR>
<P>AMERICAN MISSILE MAIL: In 1959, the postal service, in conjunction with
<BR>
the U. S. Navy, experimented with this new form of mail delivery. &quot;Before
<BR>
man reaches the moon,&quot; an official was quoted as saying, &quot;mail will be
<BR>
delivered within hours from New York to California, to Britain, to India
<BR>
or Australia by guided missiles.&quot; History proved differently. 
<BR>
<P>THE SCOPITONE: A precursor to the rock video, a coin-operated,
<BR>
large-screen visual jukebox introduced in France in 1963, showed brief
<BR>
16-millimeter films of the era's pop stars. Extinct by 1968, &quot;a victim of
<BR>
slot machines, racketeers and censorial prudes,&quot; according to Request
<BR>
magazine. 
<BR>
<P>THE SONY HANDYCAM: Released in 1998, some versions of Sony's Handycam came
<BR>
with infrared technology that allowed &quot;night shot&quot; mode. Sony recalled the
<BR>
product after it was discovered that, when the special feature was used in
<BR>
daylight or a lighted room, it could see through clothing. 
<BR>
<P>IRIDIUM SATELLITE PHONES: They promised to communicate &quot;with anyone,
<BR>
anytime, virtually anywhere in the world.&quot; The subscribers didn't come; $5
<BR>
billion was lost. Eighty-eight satellites will plunge smoking into the
<BR>
sea.
