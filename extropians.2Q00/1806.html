<EM>&gt; &gt;Seems to me she would have expected it, sooner or later.  She was totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;convinced that laissez faire capitalism would beat the pants off
</EM><BR>
socialism,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and she has proven to have been right.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, I wouldn't go that far...in fact, there are only a few countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which could even remotely be called laissez faire.  Capitalism itself
</EM><BR>
still
<BR>
<EM>&gt; sticks in the craw of many classes, and the country with the highest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population (and one of the largest land masses) is communist.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, though I think communism, as a social ideal is no longer as praised
<BR>
as it used to be.  In fact, there are a lot less people out there who want
<BR>
it than ever before -- except for those in communist countries (who are
<BR>
really not free to say what they want, or, if they are, have been
<BR>
propogandized into believing all other systems are evil especially because
<BR>
they have no experience of noncommunism).
<BR>
<P>Regarding China, more people are trying to get out than in.:)  Kind of gives
<BR>
an indication of what they really don't like.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To me, it is very uplifting to read that Russia may finally, at long last,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have sensible members of government, but the results remain to be seen; we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a long way to go.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree here on the &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude.  Though I hope for the best, I
<BR>
recall that Alan Greenspan also was influenced by Rand.  Now, granted, he is
<BR>
not the worst person ever to be on the FRB, what has he done to dismantle
<BR>
the FRS lately?  (Okay, I'm not privvy to everything that goes on in those
<BR>
meetings, but I'm pretty sure he's no for any fundamental change in the US
<BR>
monetary system in the direction of free market banking.)
<BR>
<P>Later!
