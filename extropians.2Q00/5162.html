<P><EM>&gt;Of course, if you've ever been to a nudist resort, you quickly realize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that you'd rather *not* see through clothing in most cases...
</EM><BR>
<P>Why do you say that?
<BR>
<P>The beautiful thing about what you see at a nudist resort
<BR>
is the sheer (!) number of different shapes and sizes of people.
<BR>
<P>I like seeing people completely comfortable inside their own skin,
<BR>
no matter what their &quot;skin&quot; looks like.
<BR>
<P>I like the attitude of the folks there: that a positive outlook
<BR>
and good health is more valuable than their percentage of body fat
<BR>
(or lack thereof)
<BR>
<P>And it's a good example for kids too- maybe the next generation
<BR>
of Amerians won't have such puritan attitudes about sex and nudity
<BR>
as many people in my generation (something that Americans can learn
<BR>
from the Europeans, in my opinion)
<BR>
