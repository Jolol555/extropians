<P>&lt;&lt;  actually do the same kind of genre hopping quite seamlessly, so I know
<BR>
&nbsp;what you mean.  In fact, people who are used to me as one easily
<BR>
&nbsp;identified group often show quite a bit of surprise when they see me in
<BR>
&nbsp;one of my other natural guises. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Al 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Heinlein in his story GULF (See Assignment in Eternity, a short 
<BR>
story collection) made a statement to the effect that folks like us make our 
<BR>
own rules.  Stereotypes are boring.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was raised on a raggedy pants cotton farm and still have many of those 
<BR>
types of tastes; but went on to graduate a couple of good universities, fly 
<BR>
and some other stuff.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember one boss that said to me, &quot;Harrison, you don't talk like any 
<BR>
one that could have graduated ___________.&quot;  (Why give the school a bad 
<BR>
name?)  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have cherished that remark because my boss put his finger right on the 
<BR>
one thing I liked most about that University: my professors didn't talk or 
<BR>
act like anyone from that University either; but, they were very high 
<BR>
performance.  &lt;G&gt;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to change the subject swiftly: I have seen various comments you have 
<BR>
made about diet and exercise.  I believe you were showing interest in life 
<BR>
extension and health improvement.  Have you looked at the work of Ronald M. 
<BR>
Klatz, MD with HGH?  He is on line and has a book called HGH, I believe.  In 
<BR>
addition I saw some ads in MD that implied you could reconstruct his program 
<BR>
for yourself at a much lower cost.  I decided to not pursue his program at 
<BR>
this time.  The second program that I thought might interest you is the REAL 
<BR>
AGE program.  Both of these have pages on line.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an old sailor I can't help but pick at a Marine.  So let me proceed; 
<BR>
in the 1950s I was in a Navy program in which our entire basic training, 
<BR>
except classroom training, was under the direct control and direction of 
<BR>
Marines.  I had a Marine DI, Sargeant Long, just as you did.  Can you name 
<BR>
the program?  And no, we were not being punished.
<BR>
<P>Ron Harrison
