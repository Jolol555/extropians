<EM>&gt; &gt; Sure, but you shouldn't hand them their weapons, should you? It is one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thing if they have to deliberately misrepresent us (and that can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exposed, scoring debate points), another to have to face some idiocy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some transhumanist said on a public list...

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anders, I dont see this as an issue, since any person could have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figured out a way to insert material in the archives with any name
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on it, and placed a false early date on it.  For this reason, no one should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever need to answer for anything they allegedly posted to the list.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is the logical answer, which is completely worthless in a
<BR>
rhetorical setting. Yes, maybe somebody forged that post where
<BR>
somebody said rape was right and extropian, but when your opponent
<BR>
reposts it widely to show what kind of evil people extropians are,
<BR>
your protestations will not be as effective as the emotional outrage
<BR>
the post causes. Judging from the effects of even utterly unbelievable
<BR>
hoaxes like the Protocols of the Elders of Sion have had in history,
<BR>
the fact that email can simply be forged does not help.
<BR>
<P>Even worse, if your opponent can dig up something offensive and stupid
<BR>
said by somebody who is still active on the list or even publicly
<BR>
stands by their views, then they don't even have to bother making
<BR>
things up. Unfortunately, there are always some extremist with a large
<BR>
mouth in any sufficiently large group, the trick for the opponent is
<BR>
to find him or her. 
<BR>
<P>The best defense against this is to make sure the mainstream of the
<BR>
discussion is held in a polite and understandable manner, to create
<BR>
clear principles that can help people understand that the extremist is
<BR>
just that, and overall try to gain a good reputation.
