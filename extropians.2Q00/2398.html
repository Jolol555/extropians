<EM>&gt;&gt;Surveillance has *nothing* to do with freedom.  You are free now to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;anything that is legal.  You would have that exact same freedom in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;completely transparent society.  Your only loss of freedom would be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;freedom to commit a crime and get away with it.  If you have a problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;with giving that up, I think that says more about you than it says about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem is the definition of &quot;crime&quot;. When any action that has no harm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to another person is labeled a &quot;crime&quot;, then surveillance becomes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tyrannical. We can look forward (for example) to smokers being fined by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mail, and as was stated earlier, a final breakdown of the &quot;innocent until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;proven guilty&quot; principle.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its not that I don't believe there are such things as victimless crimes 
<BR>
(sodomy between consenting adults comes to mind), but when you think about 
<BR>
the ultimate effect of many so-called victimless crimes, you begin to see 
<BR>
that society itself is the victim many times.
<BR>
<P>For instance, taking your example of smoking.  No one is harmed by the fact 
<BR>
that you smoke cigarettes, right?  Well, even putting aside the obvious 
<BR>
problem of second hand smoke, what happens when you come down with 
<BR>
emphysema?  On the off hand chance that you have sufficient private 
<BR>
insurance (or money) to cover your own medical care, then the only victims 
<BR>
(besides your own stupid self) are those who care about you and suffer 
<BR>
seeing you suffering to death.
<BR>
<P>In the more likely scenario where some form of public insurance is needed to 
<BR>
supplement your medical care, the victims of your &quot;victimless&quot; crime are (1) 
<BR>
you, (2) those who care about you, and (3) taxpayers like me who are paying 
<BR>
for your expensive medical care.
