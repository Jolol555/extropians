<EM>&gt; Regarding the Saturn 5 plans:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Maybe an FOIA search might uncover something???
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know that I've read something about this but I can't remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether it was one of Zubrin's books (Case for Mars?), or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps something out of the Starflight Handbook, or other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; papers by Mallove &amp; Matloff et al.  But it has been researched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to some degree, the problem is finding out who has the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recent info.  This was the mid-'60's so there have to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large number of individuals who actually worked on designing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and building Saturn 5's who are still alive and kicking.
</EM><BR>
<P>It might be a start.  If I had the money and time, I'd try to do the
<BR>
research.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Related to this, given modern day CAD tools and the fact that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know the Saturn 5 worked, how much of a reduction over the original
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effort do you think it would be to take to reproduce the engineering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; part of the job?  50% less? 90% less?  What fraction of the Apollo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effort went into designing the Saturn 5 and getting it to actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know, though I reckon it would be less than 100%.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; According to a paper by O'Neill on my desk, in 1975 dollars, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost of Apollo was $39 billion, space shuttle development was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $5-8 billion and advanced lift vehicle development was estimated(?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at $8-25 billion.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's $39 billion we don't have to spend again.  Overall, I prefer the
<BR>
Saturn V to the Shuttle because you don't have to worry about reuse.  The
<BR>
goal should be to make it cheap and reliable -- not to make it reusable as
<BR>
an end in itself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Sad but true in a lot of places, but I still think this would be easier
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do than making a whole new launch system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would have to think though, that scaling up the Arienne 5 or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting the Energia to be more reliable would be a cheaper approach
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than recreating the Saturn 5.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've nothing against using proven Soviet and Russian designs, but the Ariane
<BR>
5 has a habit of blowing up.:@  Plus, it's a very high end launch system.
