Well of course I have to defer to Max if he deigns to jump into this morass,
<BR>
but my view:
<BR>
<P>Everyone has their own view of what it means to be an Extropian. The
<BR>
obvious problem is that the line has to be drawn somewhere. If you have
<BR>
mormons, communists, etc. suddenly saying they believe they are Extropians,
<BR>
where are we headed then? I think the principles are there to provide some
<BR>
basic level, or backbone, of structure to draw that needed line. And if
<BR>
you fall to the other side of the line, then I don't think you can
<BR>
reasonably argue that you are an Extropian. There is nothing wrong
<BR>
with that, but I think people should go make their own sets of basic
<BR>
principles that they can live with; call it Queenetropy or Crocktropy
<BR>
or whatever, but identify yourself with some kind of word with some
<BR>
REAL MEANING behind it. If you call yourself a member of a philosophy
<BR>
that has a specific list of principles, and yet you do not agree with
<BR>
them all, then as you say it is a simple tautology that you are
<BR>
not actually a member of that philosophy, and continuing to use the
<BR>
term to describe yourself is either self-deceptive or insulting to
<BR>
others.
<BR>
<P>Is it any wonder that with so many differing views of what Extropianism
<BR>
is, that we have so much ongoing noise/conflict on the list along with
<BR>
little actual progress?

<EM>&gt; &gt; Why will you not concede the point: you may consider yourself an Extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if you agree with the principles (and in my opinion follow them). You are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not an Extropian if you cannot do that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's a silly tautology: &quot;I define X as people who believe Y, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who don't believe Y are not X&quot;.  So what?  The opposition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't arguing that, though they might think they are.  What they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really arguing is one of (a) The use of words to identify things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be less rigorous than set theory in some contexts; (b) the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; set of people who believe Y really /ought/ to believe Y', so the word
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; X should refer to Y'-believers as well; (c) while belief in Y is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; common among those calling themselves X, it's really a consequence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of those people having condition Z (which may or may not include
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beliefs), so we ought to use X to refer to Z-people, most of whom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also happen to believe in Y, but not necessarily; (d) Y itself is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so imprecisely defined that some people we don't think are X might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually be X after all, because their vision of Y is clearer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All of those are prefectly rational reasons for people to call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves &quot;Extropian&quot; when they espouse beliefs that are apparently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contrary to the principles.  Those people really ought to more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clearly state which of the above (or some other one I might have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; missed) is the case, and argue for it more clearly, but we can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dismiss them with tautologies and bluster over definitions.
