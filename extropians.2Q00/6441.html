<P>
Folks,
<BR>
<P>My inability to resist the morbid curiosity to find out what
<BR>
inanity gets said next in this mess, along with my inability to
<BR>
resist letting my attending outrage impel me unwisely, requires
<BR>
that I unsubscribe for a spell. It's taking too much time, and
<BR>
doesn't seem to be serving any purpose I think is good.
<BR>
<P>When people start making accusations of &quot;morphing,&quot; and at least
<BR>
one person makes an ad populum argument to support this
<BR>
accusation, it's clearly time to go.
<BR>
<P>The fact that I'm even responding to this is embarrassing.
<BR>
Anyway, here's a copy of part of a letter I wrote to Max (with
<BR>
some things added in, in this version):
<BR>
<P>----------------
<BR>
Max,
<BR>
<P>I'm literally sick to my stomach over this.
<BR>
<P>Carl is a well-known [...] member of [another]
<BR>
philosophy/transhumanist list. I told him about hotmail a year
<BR>
ago as a way of having regular email despite leaving grad.
<BR>
school temporarily in [location deleted]. He's a very sweet
<BR>
young guy who likes me and thinks I need defending here.
<BR>
<P>Carl told Stan I was being attacked, and that Stan should not
<BR>
use his normal email address if he wanted to defend, me becuase
<BR>
of the gun talk, and suggested hotmail. 
<BR>
<P>[....]
<BR>
---------------
<BR>
<P>To any lawyers who might be reading this: has slander or libel
<BR>
or malicious threatening or something occurred? -- against
<BR>
anyone, for that matter? I'm not familiar enough with the law to
<BR>
know. If so, this should go to court. This has gone so far
<BR>
beyond civility no other remedy will work.
<BR>
<P>Silence from the leadership here is chilling to me. (Although,
<BR>
_perhaps_, my expressed desire not to be supported by friends
<BR>
might have been taken to be a more general claim than I meant
<BR>
it.)
<BR>
<P>A quick word about Max's response to Stan. Although Stan is one
<BR>
of the people with whom I have talked extensively about this
<BR>
recent mess, and I believe it's clear that the main reason he
<BR>
posted his recent &quot;META&quot; post was simply to get people to stop
<BR>
worrying about 19th century &quot;ultra&quot; uses, it's conceivable that
<BR>
his anger over this business might have brought other
<BR>
motivations to bear on the issue, like a desire to have Max
<BR>
apologize yet again for things for which he's already
<BR>
apologized. If so, I definitely don't share that desire. Once is
<BR>
enough. The desire for more is petty.
<BR>
<P>As for the _new_ apology for the &quot;new&quot; issues. Accepted. For the
<BR>
record, I recall the events slightly differently. I'm not sure
<BR>
if the difference matter much. At this point, discussing any of
<BR>
this mess publicly, here in Extropians, seems to be serving
<BR>
other purposes than clarification.
<BR>
<P>I remain angry about many things here, including some that
<BR>
haven't been discussed at all.
<BR>
<P>Still, I remain interested in the many questions that have
<BR>
arisen here. Definitely worth discussing. But not here, not now.
<BR>
<P>I have told everyone I know in even firmer terms not to jump in
<BR>
here (I almost removed Carl's modem from his computer at one
<BR>
point). It seems the only way I can reign myself in is likewise
<BR>
to leave. (I might get on the digest version, though, which
<BR>
seems to intrude less into my mental space.)
<BR>
<P>A great loss for me, since there are so many interesting people
<BR>
here. Them, I will greatly miss.
<BR>
<P>Towards the Good!
<BR>
Brian.
<BR>
<P>P.S. 
<BR>
A request: no one email me about any of this, ever again,
<BR>
unless:
<BR>
1) we've exchanged email in the past (on anything),
<BR>
2) you're writing to apologize (I don't care much about
<BR>
apologies at this point, though), or
<BR>
3) you're Natasha.
<BR>
<P>P.P.S. Apologies to Zero Powers for the too general statement of
<BR>
yesterday (or whenever it was). I hope you can appreciate that
<BR>
someone spending a lot of time thinking about anti-Semitism
<BR>
recently might emit a typo or braino based on an unconscious
<BR>
assessment of the meaning of silence in this forum! (Even if
<BR>
such a meaning is completely absent.) I mean, compare what's
<BR>
been said about me and my friends to my ONE-liner retort to
<BR>
Natasah!!!
