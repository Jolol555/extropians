</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  an excuse to reject them is damned sloppy thinking.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Is it ever possible for you to disagree with me without throwing insults

my
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; way? Haven't I aske d you this before?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why do you interpret this statement as insulting you personally?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is no such thing; it is an honest expression of opinion on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point of philolophy--that a certain idea is stupid.  I didn't imply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in any way that you had committed such an act, and I didn't even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; include your name in the quoted text, because it wasn't relevant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you take offense every time I call something stupid just because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm replying to your message that brought the subject up, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you are going to be offended a lot, because I enjoy pointing out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stupid ideas when I see them.  It's nothing personal, it's just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what I do.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think most people would interpret it as an insult.  Whether it's true or
<BR>
not is another matter.  The problem is this.  If you call some idea or
<BR>
utterance stupid -- as opposed to using &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot; or &quot;invalid&quot;
<BR>
or a &quot;non sequitir&quot; or etc. -- it connotes a certain judgment about the
<BR>
thinker or the utterer.  For instance, if someone says, &quot;Madonna is the
<BR>
greatest artist of all time,&quot; and you reply, &quot;That's the stupidest thing
<BR>
I've heard all day,&quot; expect the person to not take you as objectively
<BR>
evaluating her or his statement and soberly relating your evaluation back to
<BR>
them, but as merely attacking her or his taste and character.  (I.e., only a
<BR>
stupid person would think that.:)
<BR>
<P>I know Lee Daniel probably did not intend it as an insult to anyone, but
<BR>
most people are going to take it that way.  Better instead to avoid such
<BR>
words where possible if, indeed, you want to discourse with others.
<BR>
<P>This does not mean there aren't stupid ideas or people out there or that we
<BR>
all don't sometimes blow off steam here.  A lot of times, too, people
<BR>
identify with their ideas and an attack on their ideas is taken as an attack
<BR>
on them.  (The worst offenders here are usually Popperians.:)
<BR>
<P>(&quot;And if you are a stupid person, please do not have sex.  There are enough
<BR>
stupid already.  And if you are stupid and you must have sex, please have
<BR>
sex with a nonhuman animal, preferably one that is smarter than you so that,
<BR>
if by some freakish accident, you do produce an offspring, chances are it
<BR>
will be smarter than you.&quot;  Thanks!:)
<BR>
<P>Of course, we all know that the Singularity will solve the problem of
<BR>
stupidity.:)
<BR>
<P>Blatantly understated,
<BR>
