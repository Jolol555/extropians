</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;OK, then: an &quot;original&quot; is that instance of a thing which existed at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;point in time at which the process of &quot;copying&quot; commenced, where &quot;copying&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;is understood as the process of creating another instance of a thing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;shares as many properties with the existing thing as physically possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I know why you've been hesitating and maybe I'm a little sadistic for pushing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  so hard but I want to see if you can really say with a straight face that the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  true original is that one celled zygote.
</EM><BR>
<P>The important part of my definition is that the term &quot;original&quot; can only
<BR>
have meaning with respect to a specific act of copying.  That zygote is
<BR>
the original with respect to the first copy you make--if you wish to make
<BR>
some connection between that and all the other originals for other acts of
<BR>
copying, that requires that you define such a relationship beforehand--
<BR>
you must already presume some continuity or some grouping relation among
<BR>
those acts of copying before you can ask which is original with respect
<BR>
to the whole group.  How you define the group, and how you choose to
<BR>
define &quot;original&quot; with respect to that group is up to you.  I still don't
<BR>
see any question here about reality that we don't all agree about.
<BR>
