Cogently said, Robert. Yet, where are the science/philosophy papers to light 
<BR>
this candle?  Example: how common is it for a scientists or other thinkers 
<BR>
like a Moravec or a Tipler to publish something, for want of a better word, 
<BR>
&quot;dramatic&quot; or dynamic? Very few and very far between is the apparent answer. 
<BR>
I would say and will say, that there has to be a critical mass for this 
<BR>
particular philosophy to takeoff. Moreover, there has to be a qualitative 
<BR>
impetus for this movement to sustain itself and succeed.

<EM> &gt; I had asked:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &lt;&lt;Where oh where did  the other folks go?&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Ah! The most fervently ignored area of interest under Extropian concerns 
</EM><BR>
or 
<BR>
<EM> &gt; TransHuman concerns.  Most peeps here on the list seem to be convinced 
</EM><BR>
that 
<BR>
<EM> &gt; they will live for 10,000 years; if not forever.  To me its the analog of 
</EM><BR>
a 
<BR>
<EM> &gt; trapeze acrobat working without a net; courageous but an extra hazard! So 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; when will those who are qualified, academically, to publish papers come up 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; with some plausible solutions for this 'situation'?  Or are we leaving it 
</EM><BR>
up 
<BR>
<EM> &gt; to Herr God?  
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I like working without a net (in Russia), it keeps you sharp.  Its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like the mental cringe our rocket engineers do every time they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;push the lauch button on those big inverted roman candles.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Speaking from experience, the costs of not getting your timing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right can be quite expensive.  Actually there seems to be quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lot of list related activity for people working in their various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ways at moving things forward.  Robin, Anders, Eliezer and a host of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;others are publishing papers on the directions in which we are going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and proposing various means for speeding things up.  Many of us who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aren't &quot;doing&quot;, are thinking about how and when &quot;to do&quot;.  When we do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do, you won't see us &quot;doing&quot;, because like Sasha or Eugene we will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;too busy to talk about it.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I think what you see is a selection effect.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;It is worth noting that when you grasp the big picture, the efforts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of single individuals are *almost* meaningless.  The trick is to discover
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the leverage points where a single individual may exert a small force
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and cause a large mass to move(*).  Then in the future, we will look back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at those points and say &quot;I stood there&quot;, realizing that that advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the pace of discovery by maybe a week, or a month, or if you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very very lucky a couple of years.

&nbsp;(*) Buckminster Fuller, I believe, used  supertanker rudder &quot;trim-tabs&quot; as
<BR>
&nbsp;the analogy for this.  Trim-tabs are at the end of a rudder and turn in
<BR>
&nbsp;a direction opposite to the motion of the rudder itself allowing water
<BR>
&nbsp;to flow around the rudder, thereby allowing the rudder to be turned
<BR>
&nbsp;more quickly with less force. &gt;&gt;
