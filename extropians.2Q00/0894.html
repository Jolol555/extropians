<EM>&gt;From this URL:
</EM><BR>

<BR>
we have:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Scientists Drs. Henry Kolm and Peter Mangeau at Massachusetts Institute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Technology believe that it would be possible to accelerate a one tonne
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; projectile to a speed of 12.3 kilometers per second in a time of only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one-and-a half a second. This would be achieved on a ramped track, built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the side of a mountain, and nearly eight kilometers long. The energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; required to operate the launch would be 76 billion Joules or, in power terms,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 50 billion Watts. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Costs of the proposal, which are discussed in the article, suggest that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either a direct electromagnetic space launcher, or a hybrid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first-stage-electromagnetic, record-stage-conventional-rocket system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could deliver payloads into space at costs very competitive with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conventional rocketry. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One of the features of the incredibly short launch time (one-and-a-half
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second of acceleration, with emergence from the atmosphere less than a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second later) is the enormous force to which any cosmonauts would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exposed. These are calculated to be as much as one thousand times the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; force of gravity. Currently, the limit for human endurance is a force
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about fifteen times that of gravity. 
</EM><BR>
<P>It goes on to discuss how you could engineer methods to allow humans
<BR>
to tolerate higher G forces.
<BR>
<P>Using the figures quoted above, and the converter at:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.bio-radiant.com/WattCalc.html">http://www.bio-radiant.com/WattCalc.html</A>
<BR>
and figuring a electricity cost of $0.10/kWh that works out
<BR>
to about $2000 to launch me and a 1 tonne-~70kg &quot;pod&quot; into orbit.
<BR>
You amortize the cost of the launch rail over a number of years
<BR>
and millions of trips and it shouldn't drive the costs up much
<BR>
more.
<BR>
<P>Hmmm, 8 km, thats about 5 miles (sorry!), anyone have a good feel
<BR>
for what the relative costs per mile are for light rail, TGV
<BR>
or Maglev?  It shouldn't be much more expensive than that.
<BR>
Maybe $10million per mile?  So at $50 million in construction
<BR>
costs, that works out to around $0.16/U.S. person.  Chump change
<BR>
by any measure.
