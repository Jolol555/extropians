<EM>&gt; &gt; Regarding controversial topics, there was a show on Discovery regarding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; surveillance camera tech.  It was in the most libertarian, low tax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; state in the U.S., Nevada, in the casinos.  Im surprised none of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; us thought of it:  its perfect.  With buttloads of untraceable money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; floating around all over the place and being a thief magnet as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as a strange attractor for every amateur card shark and trickster,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the casinos have every reason to buy all the latest and greatest high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tech surveillance gear, face recognition software, rooms filled floor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to ceiling with banks of whirring VCRs recording every wink and twitch.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And best of all, it has no Orwell angle: its all voluntary.  No one forces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anyone to go into a casino.  They had some wicked cool stuff there.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't have any problem with anyone having as much surveillance
<BR>
equipment on their own private property as they feel they need (its when
<BR>
it goes on my private property, or views my private property, that I get
<BR>
fussy). However I do think that they are a bit  unfair in their
<BR>
exclusion of individuals who are skilled winning gamblers. Being able to
<BR>
count cards is no great feat, its something that many people can learn,
<BR>
and its no different a gaming strategy than picking your favority color
<BR>
or going by your wifes and kids birthdays on the lottery or in roulette
<BR>
(though more successful on average). I can imagine that there will come
<BR>
a day when they will exclude all augmented individuals. I'd like to be
<BR>
the one bringing them to court and getting them to admit that their
<BR>
games are intended for suckers and dimwits, and with our augmentations
<BR>
we are incapable of being such.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It should also be noted that Nevada has very strict privacy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laws that are actually fairly &quot;anti-big brother&quot;.  It is generally known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the State of Nevada will not disclose many of the records it collects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the Federal government, and Federal regulatory agencies in particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (such as the IRS).  Since federal regulatory agencies do not have any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular constitutional authority to demand such access, this is often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used as a roadblock to keep things out of Federal hands (you see signs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on buildings here that state that federal agents must have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detailed federal warrant AND be accompanied by the local sheriff or their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requests will not be honored).  
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm getting to like Nevada more and more, and just wish that there was
<BR>
someplace in the state that remained relatively cool in the summer. My
<BR>
body just doesn't beleive in the old 'but its a dry heat' claim...
