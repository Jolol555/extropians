Excellent advice, Mike.  I've worked with many small businesses (some of
<BR>
which later became large)as a consultant and have run a couple of my own
<BR>
(and am currently working on another).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I'd add to the partnership portion of your advice:  if you MUST take on
<BR>
partners or investors approach the deal as you'd approach getting married.
<BR>
When I had clients who were entering into a joint business venture, I used
<BR>
to give them a modified version of some rules of conduct a psychologist
<BR>
friend of mine used for marriage counseling.  Then I'd advise them to go
<BR>
home and watch that great old Humphrey Bogart film *The Treasure of the
<BR>
Sierra Madre*.  Trouble often arises between co-venturers when the business
<BR>
begins to make serious money.
<BR>
<P>Also--in entering into contracts, write down all the terms.  Not necessarily
<BR>
because the other guy might try to screw you.  In most disputes I dealt
<BR>
with, both parties were acting in good faith.  But everyone sees and hears
<BR>
from his or her own viewpoint, and it's amazing how often the parties give
<BR>
entirely different interpretations to the same words.  Getting it down in
<BR>
writing doesn't guarantee you won't have problems, but it helps, because
<BR>
people tend to think more carefully when they write stuff down.

Ha. At 22 I started a business with two older guys with an idea that I
<BR>
thought would make me millions. Government policy changed, budgeting
<BR>
dissapeared, and well, those virtual millions did too. I did get an
<BR>
excellent education in start-up and operation of a business. Since then
<BR>
I've been self employed and making a decent living (with far less stress
<BR>
than being under someone elses' thumb), and am getting ready to launch
<BR>
my own ISP company up here.
