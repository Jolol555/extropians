<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two things I need to do: sign up for cryonic suspension and get
<BR>
an organ donor card. I can do the latter today, and the former in a few
<BR>
years, when/if I'm earning money. So, the question is: how compatible is
<BR>
organ donation with cryonics?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As things stand, I think I'm right in saying, a successful revival from
<BR>
cryonic freezing will require nanotech. I would suggest that a world with
<BR>
nanotech advanced enough to undo the damage of freezing would be a world in
<BR>
which compatible replacement organs could be grown from scratch, in situ.
<BR>
So, if I died tomorrow, I can't see any reason why I shouldn't be
<BR>
philanthropically Extropian and extend the life of a few other people with
<BR>
my (hopefully healthy) organs.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if a freezing/reviving procedure is developed in which
<BR>
somatic damage is nil, and thus nanotech is not a prerequisite, then the
<BR>
answer is different. In this case, for example, a cure for the disease from
<BR>
which I die may turn up a year later, long before nanotech is viable, and so
<BR>
it would be rather important, for a quick revival, that I still had all my
<BR>
internal organs. (Actually, in this case there is a question of strength of
<BR>
belief involved: if one is convinced that nanotech will develop and allow
<BR>
regrowth of removed organs at some point, one could still donate, as long as
<BR>
one is prepared to wait a little longer for revival.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has anyone else on the list thought about this question? As things stand,
<BR>
in the absence of a 'perfect' freezing/revival mechanism, I cannot see any
<BR>
reason not to carry a donor card. This position is presumably supported by
<BR>
all those who have opted for head-only cryonic suspension.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of the cryonics service providers (Alcor et al.), are
<BR>
they in a position to work alongside the teams removing organs, to begin
<BR>
procedures ensuring a minimum of neurological damage? Also, would the
<BR>
removal of organs, and the subsequent disruption to systemic organs (lymph,
<BR>
circulatory, etc.) interfere with the cryo-preservation procedure?
<BR>
