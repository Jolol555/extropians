<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20Commie%20Nonsense&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGKEGOFFAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately in a country with a bad government, a poor economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system, and high infant mortality having many children may be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only answer to having someone to care for you in your old age.
</EM><BR>
<P>Neither &quot;a government&quot; nor &quot;an economic system&quot; is an entity capable of
<BR>
holding beliefs, making decisions, or acting.  Individual people believe,
<BR>
decide, and act.
<BR>
<P>The poor women I know who have more children than they're able to take care
<BR>
of certainly didn't get pregnant time after time after time in order to have
<BR>
someone to take care of them in their old age.  Many of them were forced by
<BR>
their husbands to have sex when they didn't want to(and when they went to
<BR>
the priest to ask for advice, they were told to go home to their husbands
<BR>
and be good wives), and were prevented from using contraceptives or getting
<BR>
abortions by people employed by the Catholic church and various governmental
<BR>
entities.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Excuse me, this is most certainly NOT a definition of Fascism. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are confusing government corruption and the actions of greedy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people, with capitalism.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the way it was in Germany &amp; Italy in the 1930's and 1940's, and
<BR>
their form of economic/political system was referred to as fascist. This is
<BR>
why I defined the term in that way.  The U.S. is going farther down that
<BR>
same road every day.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Some have used abused capitalist inventions like the corporation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and were met by another capitalist invention, the trade union.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These people then tried (often successfully) to get the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to limit these groups. Others have used pure capitalist means to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successfully avoid unions. (Unions are a result of bad management)
</EM><BR>
<P>There were corporations benefiting from government intervention in the
<BR>
economy from the get-go.  To the best of my knowledge there has never been a
<BR>
pure market economy in the U.S.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What kind of government you have will determine what kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economic system you have. Capitalism is an economic system, NOT a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; form of government.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't understand what you mean in the above 2 sentences. Could you
<BR>
clarify, please?
<BR>
<P>Bonnie
