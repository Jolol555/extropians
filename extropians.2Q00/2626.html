<EM>&gt; &gt;And freedom is slavery.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;When I became part of the 'cryonics crowd,' I made a deal with myself that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I wouldn't become frightened enough of death to live a longer life less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;worth living.  That means I'm still willing to sacrifice my life for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;others if I see the need, and that I'm very cautious about sacrificing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;freedom for the sake of security.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Surveillance has *nothing* to do with freedom.  You are free now to do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything that is legal.  You would have that exact same freedom in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely transparent society.  Your only loss of freedom would be the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom to commit a crime and get away with it.  If you have a problem with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; giving that up, I think that says more about you than it says about society.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  It says that my ideas of morality are not identical to those of our
<BR>
current lawmakers.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My current life partner is of the same gender as I am.  Sometimes
<BR>
we hold hands when we are walking down the street.  Sometimes, when no one
<BR>
else is around, I even kiss her.  In many places, this is still listed as
<BR>
a crime.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm walking around with my friends, we often discuss
<BR>
possiblilities for the future--any and all, including futures in which the
<BR>
United States government no longer exists (we are none of us liable to act
<BR>
to further such a future, but it's awkward to insert disclaimers such as
<BR>
this one into all of our statements).  This is definitely illegal.
<BR>
<P><P>It says that I don't like being watched under the assumption that I'm
<BR>
going to do something nasty.  I don't like being stared at by policemen
<BR>
either.  I particularly don't like being watched by people I can't
<BR>
see.  This is a matter of aesthetic preference.
<BR>
<P><P>It says I believe that any sort of surveilance leads to conformity.  In a
<BR>
society of this complexity, most people are not entirely certain what is
<BR>
legal and what isn't.  If they know they are being watched by authority,
<BR>
they will therefore constrain their actions and appearance to be as much
<BR>
like those around them as possible.  While constraint of behavior is by no
<BR>
means equivalent to constraint of thought, the two do tend to go together
<BR>
psychologically.  Certainly dialogue, or communicative behavior, is
<BR>
constrained.  Furthermore, if people know the government is watching them
<BR>
at particular street-corners, they are likely to come into the habit of
<BR>
assuming surveilance elsewhere and modifying their behavior
<BR>
accordingly.  Therefore surveilance is likely to, long-run, decrease the
<BR>
flow of new ideas in public, and the diversity of public
<BR>
appearance/behavior.  This is not extropic.
<BR>
<P><P>(It also says, if I'm going to be honest, that perhaps I think
<BR>
Lockheed-Martin ought to buy their surveilance photos from private Russian
<BR>
satelite owners, same as the rest of us.  However, I am against the public
<BR>
surveilance that is already in place as well, with the exception of very
<BR>
limited things like the cameras that focus on ATM keypads.  Just because
<BR>
people tell me a development is inevitable does not mean I will not fight
<BR>
it if I think the effects will be overall harmful--even once it is in
<BR>
place.  Likewise, I continue to work for positive developments even when
<BR>
everyone says they are impossible, if I think the possibility is
<BR>
worthwhile.)
<BR>
<P><P>In the particular case being discussed, it also says that I don't approve
<BR>
of profit-based law enforcement, and that Lockheed-Martin is not my duly
<BR>
elected government.
