Subject: hospice cases
<BR>
<P>As we have reported several times, dying under hospice care is the best
<BR>
current way to minimize delay in initiating cryonics procedures after death 
<BR>
of the patient. We have had several such experiences, all good ones. In 
<BR>
Oakland County, Michigan, if the patient dies at home under hospice care, 
<BR>
and if there is no one there authorized to pronounce death, then someone 
<BR>
calls the EMS, which usually arrives within 5-10 minutes; they phone the 
<BR>
nearest hospital emergency room and report the (lack of) vital signs, and 
<BR>
the ER physician pronounces over the phone.
<BR>
<P>This is what happened with Walter Runkel and Helmer Fredriksson. There were 
<BR>
also others, including Andrea Foote in Washtenaw County. In Maricopa County, 
<BR>
Arizona, under local law and custom, if the patient dies
<BR>
at home under hospice care, a family member can pronounce death--so long as 
<BR>
you know a physician will later sign the death certificate. A hospice nurse 
<BR>
will come out if requested, but it isn't necessary.
<BR>
<P>When Mae died, her daughter Bonnie had the watch; she called me immediately 
<BR>
when Mae stopped breathing, and I confirmed death and we started the 
<BR>
cool-down etc. Not more than a minute or two delay.
<BR>
I plan to move back to Michigan this summer. Suicide is not illegal there, 
<BR>
although assisted suicide is illegal.
<BR>
<P>Before my death, if I have the luxury of anticipating it while still compos 
<BR>
mentis, I hope to persuade a medical examiner to have a representative 
<BR>
present at my suicide and ready to pronounce death and waive autopsy, with 
<BR>
our perfusion team on hand.
