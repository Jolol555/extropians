<EM>&gt; Well Brian, I took a look at Fool.com, but I couldn't find the figures you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mention in your post (11% average yield for over 75 years).  My suggestion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to hold low-risk bonds to maturity and then reinvest, as opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investing in the stock market(including mutual funds) is based on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; observations of my own and my clients' portfolios, and some research I did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when I was at the University of Texas School of Business.  I used S&amp;P 500 as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my data source, because they tracked the widest variety of stocks.  It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been a long time, and I don't remember the exact figures, but in general I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't think you can depend on stocks to do much better than break even at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best after inflation is taken into account.  It's true that some people DO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get rich in stocks.  Some people get rich from playing lotteries too. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know, I know, a lot of people have made money in the stock market lately,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I do try to keep an open mind.  Maybe I messed up when I was doing my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research.  Maybe I tended to attract clients who were unusually bad at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; playing the stock market.  Maybe things have changed. But Fool.com has not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; convinced me that I'm wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Brian is correct.  Depending on how you calculate it and the adjustments
<BR>
you take into account, the average return of the stock market is in the
<BR>
9-13% range annually when averaged over decades.  Most people cite figures
<BR>
in the 10-12% range, which Brian did.  These figures go back to when the
<BR>
American stock market was created in this country.  In fact, investment in
<BR>
individual stocks are among the very best long-term instruments in terms
<BR>
of beating negative return factors such as taxes and inflation.
<BR>
<P>The mistake people make is forgetting that this is the average for the
<BR>
entire market.  If you put all your money in one or two stocks (especially
<BR>
ones of dubious value), it obviously will not reflect the market as a
<BR>
whole -- this is why diversification is so strongly recommended by
<BR>
investment advisors.  A properly diversified portfolio (or an index fund
<BR>
if you are lazy) will never fail to yield good annual long-term returns
<BR>
for all practical purposes.  Short of a serious statistical anomaly and
<BR>
poor investment practice, the stock market provides some of the safest and
<BR>
best investment instruments available.
<BR>
<P>In short, a blind monkey with a diversified portfolio can expect an 11%
<BR>
return over the long-term.  A smart person with good investment practices
<BR>
can usually do significantly better and rarely fairs much worse. 
<BR>
Unfortunately, there is an uninformed percentage of the investing
<BR>
population that is not content to simply &quot;ride&quot; the market and tries to
<BR>
beat it through pure luck, an unnecessary risk.  These people should have
<BR>
listened to the blind monkey.
