<EM>&gt; &gt; As one who deeply respects Gates and Microsoft, I want MS to resume as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has for the last decade: innovative, growing and successful; working within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a system which has none of those facets makes it hard for me to see how it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can be done.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I strongly advise you to read Judge Jackson's original Findings of Fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the Microsoft case, at:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://usvms.gpo.gov/ms-conclusions.html">http://usvms.gpo.gov/ms-conclusions.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft's practices have sought to establish and maintain a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the operating system field. They have then used the leverage this has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given them to establish strongholds in other areas. In all of these,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they have ignored standards compliance, acted uncompetetively to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point of illegality and in general been directly in the way of free and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open control of technological development - something I know people on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this list support. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Speak for yourself.  I think we all know Microsoft has done these
<BR>
things--I certainly do.  My reactions is &quot;so what's your point?&quot;
<BR>
Sure, Microsoft has bent every rule in the book, but that's
<BR>
exactly Shaun's point: why does it continue to support a system
<BR>
with such silly rules that it has to stretch to build an honest
<BR>
monopoly?  Why support a system that makes it more difficult than
<BR>
it naturally is to subvert public standards for fun and profit?
<BR>
<P>Unlike Shaun, I would never have even used the word &quot;innovative&quot;
<BR>
since I know Microsoft has been anything but, but I still agree
<BR>
with his point. Why do we tolerate a system that foces people to
<BR>
play &quot;fair&quot; where that definition is ludicrous?
<BR>
