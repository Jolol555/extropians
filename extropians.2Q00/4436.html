<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;A cultist is one who...home schools for their children;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So what was the final verdict?  This is a fake quote, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It would hafta be.  I cant imagine any politician stupid enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to qualify a person for government interference for a strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; belief in the second amendment, not even JR.
</EM><BR>
<P>The giveaway in the &quot;quote&quot; was the phrase &quot;big government&quot;.  I've never
<BR>
heard an advocate of big government refer to it as such.
<BR>
<P>The quote seemed plausible enough at first glance, but as the about.com
<BR>
&quot;Urban Legends&quot; page points out, read it a couple of times and it begins
<BR>
to look, well, not quite right - unless you really want to believe.
<BR>
<P>Being a Second Amendment advocate in some parts is tantamount to insanity. 
<BR>
I live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the heart of old-school
<BR>
unreconstructed &quot;liberalism&quot;. You can lose friends by bringing it up,
<BR>
and your neighbors may shun you based on the junk mail they see you
<BR>
receiving (this is not always a bad thing).  I can easily see how in certain
<BR>
circles gun rights advocacy might be equated with, well, undesirable
<BR>
antisocial behavior that the government ought to be looking into, remembering
<BR>
that the position of many of these people is that the government ought to
<BR>
be looking into everything.
<BR>
