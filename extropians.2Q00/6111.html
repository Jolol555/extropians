....Marx's sharp
<BR>
<EM>&gt;distinction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;between workers and capitalists strongly suggests to me that he did not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;appreciate the nature of human capital. Capital to him was material stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accumulated by a capitalist class. If he did have the notion of human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capital, how could he make such a radical distinction between worker and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capitalist?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm not saying that Marx was an idiot for this. It's reasonably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;understandable at the time of his writings, during the late Industrial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Revolution, that he didn't appreciate human capital--knowledge, innovation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;coordination, exploration, etc. But, combined with his mistaken labor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;theory of value, it produces disastrous errors in his economics. (His labor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;theory of value also attributes all value to physical labor, ignoring the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;role of knowledge, coordination and other forms of human capital.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
One could almost wonder if perhaps Marx secretly spent a lot of time 
<BR>
studying in China.  His view of human capital - or lack thereof - is pretty 
<BR>
much in line with the traditional - and current - Chinese business view.  
<BR>
The only thing that matters, long-term, in that culture, for the majority of 
<BR>
people, is one's personal, and most especially family relations (as in &quot;la 
<BR>
familia,&quot; or &quot;la cosa nostra&quot;).  Everyone else is fair game, and naive if 
<BR>
they think otherwise.
<BR>
<P>Workers with key knowledge and essential skills requiring months or years of 
<BR>
experience are treated with as much contempt by management as newbies right 
<BR>
off the farm.  To do otherwise would be to upset their power structure, 
<BR>
which is what they absolutely depend on.  The workers accept this as natural 
<BR>
and good business, but at the first opportunity they take revenge, or 
<BR>
secretly sabotage, or sell the key information to the competition.
<BR>
<P>It's hardly surprising that Marxism would have such an attraction in a 
<BR>
culture where it really did model reality to such a degree.  Of course, it 
<BR>
only made things worse - out with the old boss, etc...
