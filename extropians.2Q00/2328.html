<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;I consider it a moral duty to hide from and cheat a tyrannical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; I would agree that it would be the right thing to do to try to evade the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; strictures of a malevolent government (tyrannical or otherwise), but 
</EM><BR>
since 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; do not have that opinion of my government, I am content to cooperate 
</EM><BR>
with 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If you cooperate with the present US Government to a greater extent than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to protect your own safety (i.e. paying to taxes to stay out of jail is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  OK, but buying T-Bills is not), you are morally complicit in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  atrocities committed by that government.  One MILLION Americans are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rotting in prison having harmed no person or property; armed agents of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the government routinely confiscate billions of dollars worth of property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  without trial or even accusation; thousands of immigrants are collected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and returned to more oppressive governments; if that's not tyrrany, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  what is?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and it is entirely legal and extremely costly to support the laws 
<BR>
against victimless &amp; political crimes. On this one, I have to agree with lee. 
<BR>
It may be that we disagree on WHICH activities our law should and should not 
<BR>
involve itself in (I for one don't think taxation is a crime, yet many of my 
<BR>
friends do, yet I think the things my taxes go for could be amended). 
<BR>
I don't share the viewpoint that we live in a totally harmful nation, we have 
<BR>
many lovely things to be thankful for : )
<BR>
But to state that you back every single political move as &quot;non-malevolent&quot; 
<BR>
(and we probably have no idea just how corrupt things really are) is an 
<BR>
ostrich-head move if I have ever seen one! 
<BR>
<P>N
<BR>
(PS: Lee: Notice that ostrich-head is a metaphor for not *wanting* to think 
<BR>
about stuff, which is entirely different from calling an idea itself stupid, 
<BR>
and actually more harmful than sheer ignorance or lack of intelligence).
<BR>
<P>(PSS: Just because you're not paranoid does not mean they're not after you)
