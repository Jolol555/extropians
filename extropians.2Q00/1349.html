Al, I have to agree with you on your decision to wait.  If we have an average 
<BR>
life span of 75 years then you have something close to forty years to go.  At 
<BR>
the rate we are progressing you will see practical immortality long before 
<BR>
your time is up.  I am sixty five and even getting that feeling about the 
<BR>
majority of people my age.
<BR>
<P>In the fifties all Marine and Naval aviators were trained in Pensacola, Fla.  
<BR>
A very high percentage of those aviators went through the program as Naval 
<BR>
Aviation Cadets or NavCads.  I was one of those.  All of our DIs and almost 
<BR>
all of our Battalion Officers were Marines.  The classroom and gym 
<BR>
instructors were a mix of civilians, Marines, Navy, Officers and Enlisted 
<BR>
according to some system that I never had a clue about.  So while I was a 
<BR>
four year sailor I had sixteen weeks under a Marine DI with mostly Marine 
<BR>
Battalion Officers.  The B_____s were good.  (I smile when I say that, 
<BR>
Pardner)  :))
<BR>
<P>I also held every level of cadet rank from cadet to company cadet commander.
