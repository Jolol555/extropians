The present retention rate for the Amish is about 75%, though estimates
<BR>
range from 50% to 85%. Leaving the Amish means leaving your family,
<BR>
not something to be taken lightly.  There are support groups in the
<BR>
Lancaster, PA area for the those who leave.
<BR>
<P>Many of the Amish have cell phones, faxes, and computers in their business
<BR>
ventures these days.  Some of what has been described on this list
<BR>
about the Amish is out of date and colored by media reporting.

<EM>&gt; Mormonism has a low retaining rate, however, from what I hear. How do

<EM>&gt; the other religious minorities fare? Amish, Mennonites, etc.?

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can Amish still claim a low rate of defection?
