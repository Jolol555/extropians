<EM>&gt; Removing the Internet Explorer &quot;E&quot; icon is not feasible.  It is scary for

<EM>&gt; neophyte users.
</EM><BR>
<P>Anyone who is that much of a neophyte isn't going to have an opinion about
<BR>
what browser they want to use, either.  I mean, come on, all you have to do
<BR>
is click on it and hit the delete key.
<BR>
<P>And for people who really are that ignorant of computers, the fact that they
<BR>
don't have to worry about choosing a browser unless they want to is a big
<BR>
benefit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As aWindows user, what I want is the ability to add and remove all
</EM><BR>
components of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the operating system and rebuild the kernel fine-tuned to my
</EM><BR>
specifications.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, as I am paranoid, I want to verify system security which is not
</EM><BR>
feasible
<BR>
<EM>&gt; otherwise.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cool.  I want world peace, a billion dollars and &lt;obscene comments deleted&gt;.
<BR>
Does that mean I can reasonably complain if I don't get what I want?
<BR>
<P>Making Windows highly configurable is actually a fairly big priority with
<BR>
Microsoft, but there are limits to what is practical. Customers also have
<BR>
lots of other things they want, like perfect stability, an infinite number
<BR>
of new features, and smaller/faster software.  You can't have all of those
<BR>
things at once, no matter how much money you spend.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, as a user of this software for which money was indirectly tendered
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft, I am the customer, and thus always right, and so want the
</EM><BR>
source code
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to build my own compiler and kernel, and basic operating system services,
</EM><BR>
and to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be able to then pick and choose what operating system enhancements I find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relevant, and then to pick and choose application software that best fits
</EM><BR>
my own
<BR>
<EM>&gt; personal requirements.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you want Linux, use Linux.  Most people emphatically do NOT want to be
<BR>
able to do such things, and that's the market MS is targeting.  Their
<BR>
approach is to give users and administrators nice GUI interfaces for
<BR>
everything they say they want to be able to manipulate, and then bury
<BR>
everything else under a layer of automation so that no one has to worry
<BR>
about it.
