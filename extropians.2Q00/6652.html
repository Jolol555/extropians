<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I don't think it's too presumptuous of me to suggest

<EM>&gt; &gt; that the thriving US biotech industry is due in no small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; part to the lack of a government monopoly in health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; care.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This might possibly be so. Then again, I see in the papers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the cures to flu and HIV infection have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developed by Australian labs. They have then been sold to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the people with the most money, but brilliant innovation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hasn't been noticeably stifled. Australians, pitiful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; victims of raging socialism though we are, developed in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vitro technology and a lot of the fundamental work in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immunology.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not just talking about the sort of innovations we see in
<BR>
university labs; perhaps more immediately important are the
<BR>
ones that simply reduce costs or make some treatment
<BR>
slightly more effective and therefore more available.  This
<BR>
is the sort of work usually done by the private sector.
<BR>
(Not to mention incubating and distributing the innovations
<BR>
that do come out of university labs.)  Overall I would tend
<BR>
to agree that innovation isn't being stifled - it may even
<BR>
be helped, I find it difficult to come up with convincing
<BR>
argument that a lot of &quot;pure&quot; research would get done
<BR>
without public funding - but biotech and other industries
<BR>
don't thrive on innovation alone.
<BR>
<P>I don't know how much privately funded research is being
<BR>
done in Australia, but in Britain, where we are also victims
<BR>
of raging socialism (not to mention &quot;draconian&quot; gun laws),
<BR>
we have quite a few biotech start-ups and so on.  However, I
<BR>
get the impression that they're fairly reliant on the US for
<BR>
money, which is why I'd be worried about the US adopting a
<BR>
health care system similar to ours.
<BR>
<P>Elsewhere you mentioned a &quot;guaranteed income floor&quot; and
<BR>
other similar measures; it occurred to me that I'd only
<BR>
really be comfortable applying my earlier argument to health
<BR>
care and other more direct forms of welfare that negatively
<BR>
impact their markets.  I could probably form an argument
<BR>
that a guaranteed income would impact the &quot;labour market&quot;
<BR>
but I think the issue is far more involved.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's a complex issue.
</EM><BR>
<P>At the moment we have a number of nations taking a number of
<BR>
different approaches, and I think that's our safest bet.
