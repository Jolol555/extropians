<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm a willing capitalist now.  But there are many in our society who don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have my luck and/or ability.  Some of them live at a level of subsistence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which IMO is beneath that fit for a human.  That saddens me.  I believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; someday we'll be able to do better.  That's *all* I was saying.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Such people are the way they are because they buy the lie that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deserve more than what they've got, that they should not have to work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for it. It saddens me that purportedly intelligent people like you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue to give such failed ideas credence, which condemns generations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of millions of people to lives of squalor, hate, resentment, and failure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because they are programmed to beleive the lie you give credence to.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't put it quite that black-and-white, Michael.  Yes, socialism
<BR>
in any form /will/ condemn those people to lives as second-class citizens,
<BR>
even in a world of material abundance.  But not necessarily by any fault
<BR>
of their own.  On an individual level, the relationship between work and
<BR>
success simply isn't as direct as Rand would like--there really do exist
<BR>
such things as blind luck, unequal opportunity, predation.  The greater
<BR>
the overall abundance, the less painful the consequences of them are,
<BR>
but they'll always be there.
<BR>
<P>While I disagree with Zero about the lot of the less fortunate--even
<BR>
some of the poorest Americans are far wealthier than the /average/
<BR>
Cuban--I do not for a moment think that each of those Cubans is personally
<BR>
responsible for eir squalid life because of their beliefs.  Most of
<BR>
them are probably quite rational and self-interested, making the best
<BR>
of the opportunities available to them.
<BR>
