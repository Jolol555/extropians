<P><EM>&gt;&gt; It's a way to see our own tracks through our own life-forest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Looking at one's life-tracks can be enlightening. It also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; shows how the sum of every experience makes us who we are today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is the exact reason I keep a diary. For those who do not, I cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recommend anything more highly. A month of life in which you have recorded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your thoughts and the things which have concerned and affected you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be worth an entire year which you went through without, in my opinion.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Question: Do your different moods affect the frequency or depth
<BR>
that you write in your journal? And if you write the same amount, and
<BR>
in the same way, what helps you do that?
<BR>
<P>I'm trying to write with the same frequency/depth in my journals
<BR>
no matter what mood I'm in, but I'm generally not successful.
<BR>
My writing is irregular- I write a ton of stuff in my journal
<BR>
when I'm working through something complicated or difficult, and
<BR>
I don't write much in it when my mood is neutral or feeling upbeat-
<BR>
those are the times that I feel more like writing email to friends
<BR>
and family.
<BR>
<P>My relationship with poetry works in a similar way- I write a
<BR>
lot of dark poetry when I am working through something difficult,
<BR>
and then when I'm upbeat, I like to read alot of poetry that
<BR>
resonates with me at that time. I have a friend who does exactly
<BR>
the opposite- when he's feeling blue, he finds other people's
<BR>
poetry that expresses his blue mood,and then when he's feeling
<BR>
neutral or upbeat, he writes alot of poetry.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps this just shows that creativity and the the art
<BR>
of expression may be expressed more easily when a person's mood
<BR>
is a particular way, but it's different for everyone.
<BR>
<P>I like very much this book for ideas of ways of expressing oneself
<BR>
creatively. It's not so much about journaling, but it shows
<BR>
the different and important ways that we reveal ourselves (to
<BR>
ourselves) when we write:
<BR>
<P>Deena Metzger, _Writing for your Life_ (A Guide and Companion
<BR>
to the Inner Worlds)
<BR>
<P>This book also helps to connect our &quot;little&quot; stories into &quot;bigger&quot;
<BR>
stories, to see the flow and patterns of our lives. I tend to look
<BR>
for and use symbols from mythology and the several-thousand year-old
<BR>
stories of different cultures when I connect my little stories.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Coupled with meditation (the two usually overlapping), it has brought me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an incredible insight into not just myself, but others also. I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surprised it didn't occur to me to mention here earlier, in fact.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for the tip! I never before thought of the two methods working
<BR>
together, but it makes a lot of sense to me.
<BR>
