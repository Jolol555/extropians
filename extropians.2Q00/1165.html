<P><EM>&gt; What I m the focusing on the obscure and strange notion of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'resurrection' that can be outlined in a pure, materialist, physicalist, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; objectivist, hypothesis.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've thought very hard about lifespan extension, the technologies
<BR>
involved, and the possibilities &quot;around&quot; the fatality of death
<BR>
for ~8 years.  I can see no basis for the classic &quot;resurrection&quot;
<BR>
hypothesis.  I can see a clear path for reanimation if you don't destroy
<BR>
the body.  Once the body is gone however (or most of the greater
<BR>
than molecule sized pieces), I can't see how you would recreate it.
<BR>
It becomes simply an information theoretic question about how
<BR>
much you have to disassemble it before the information contained
<BR>
in it can no longer be reassembled accurately.  *If* and its a
<BR>
very big *if*, you have a computer larger than the universe that
<BR>
is running the simulation, you *might* be able to run it backwards
<BR>
and recreate everyone.  But I believe that has to be an existing
<BR>
precondition, which is in the realm of faith and not things we
<BR>
can engineer ourselves.  It is also very questionable whether
<BR>
you can run the universe backwards given information loss down
<BR>
black holes (oops, there goes the last atom of Spudboys's old body...)
<BR>
and the random choices that get made by things operating at the
<BR>
quantum level *and* the limits dictated by chaos theory.  I suspect
<BR>
you would have to have a very big computer and you would get a multitude
<BR>
of &quot;backward&quot; running universes.  Which one do you want -- the one
<BR>
where you exist or the one where you don't?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am concerned with that amongst our August group (or anywhere else) there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appears to be a dearth of such intellectual creativity on this admittedly, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unusual, topic.
</EM><BR>
Well, Anders' IQ is about 10 points above mine and I think he is in
<BR>
the same camp I'm in on this scenario.  That means it requires someone
<BR>
on Tipler's level to begin to tackle the problem.  There may be a few
<BR>
people like that lurking amongst us, but most of them have better things
<BR>
to do with their time.   You are talking a very small set of people with
<BR>
this brain power.  Probaly only a few thousand of them on the planet.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Moreover, I believe that this line of study would make 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in-roads with the general public. I mean, if you have at least pointed the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way out of permanent death, then nonotech and macro-engineering would be much 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easier to gather support for.
</EM><BR>
<P>I *can* point out a complete engineered path out of permanent death
<BR>
up to the limits of the best understanding of the lifetime of the
<BR>
universe (when the protons decay).  I can even punt when it comes
<BR>
to SI level brain power being able to (maybe) create altiverses
<BR>
and tunnel us into them.  I cannot however find any way to
<BR>
&quot;resurrect&quot; individuals currently dead and not cryopreserved.
<BR>
<P>My impression when I explain this path to people is that they
<BR>
lose all standard frames of reference and don't have any idea
<BR>
what to do with it.  People have a hard time supporting things
<BR>
that they really don't understand.  So I usually have to punt
<BR>
and say you are going to live two thousand years (on average),
<BR>
be fabulously rich and spend most of your time redesigning your
<BR>
larger-than-Gates-style mansion while complaining all the time
<BR>
about the prices the nanobots are charging you for construction.
<BR>
Most people *even* have a hard time with that.
