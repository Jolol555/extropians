<EM>&gt; Which police are those? Last time I was at Heathrow, the place was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; positively crawling with 'police' with HK's and Uzi's.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Well, yes. Heathrow is something like the world's #2 airport by
<BR>
passenger volume and the world's #2 airport in terms of being a hot
<BR>
terrorist target. If you'd been there during the late eighties you'd
<BR>
have seen soldiers and tanks, too.
<BR>
<P>Drawing a conclusion about the state of policing in a country by
<BR>
looking at it's main airport during a terrorist scare is ... well, words
<BR>
fail me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How about the proposition that due to the better economy, the black
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market of the criminals is more valuable, and therefore more worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protecting, as well as affording criminals the ability to better afford
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; black market weapons. Granted you'll have a lot more Liverpool toughs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who can afford to go and cause trouble at the football games.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Interesting hypothesis; however there seem to be far fewer organised
<BR>
gangs in the UK than in the US.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Sure. I was thinking of cameras a few metres from the optical head,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and some sort of attenuator or fuse to stop that sort of attack. Which,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; incidentally, is going to get you nailed _fast_. One of the obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; things for the law'n'order brigate to do with cameras is to vigorously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prosecute people caught vandalizing them. Another obvious thing is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; arrest anyone seen approaching a camera that goes blank. And one thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they _already_ do is put up cameras with overlapping fields of view, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that if you take out one, you'll be on tape via the other.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So my earlier assertions of the number of cameras needed goes up if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have overlapping fields of view that are at sufficient resolution to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as evidence. More expensive system, higher taxes.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Er, no: it means bigger production runs for the cameras, which means
<BR>
economies of scale, which means they get cheaper -- nonlinearly. Today,
<BR>
you can buy the camera-on-a-chip bits from high street stores for about
<BR>
forty pounds, retail in quantity of one. That's also about the same
<BR>
price as the circuitry that goes into a GSM phone these days. (Do you
<BR>
know about broadband GSM, by the way?)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The point of active measures in civil disobedience is to make it as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expensive as possible for them to maintain their authority. A low level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; war of attrition on them, even if your side has losses, will sap their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will to the point where they will push for greater, more overt, control,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; raise taxes, and be more likely to public violate the human rights of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those of us they do catch. Standard ChiCom insurgency strategy. Works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wonders.
</EM><BR>
<P>Please be my guest and volunteer to have your human rights violated ;-)
<BR>
<P>Seriously, I don't like omnipresent surveillance. But the idea of 
<BR>
attacking it via a Maoist insurgency strikes me as even worse, because
<BR>
(a) it makes life _significantly_ worse for the majority of the
<BR>
population, (b) it accelerates the drift into authoritarianism
<BR>
(remember, the Maoist insurgency doctrine was _designed_ to produce 
<BR>
popular support for a dictatorship -- just not the one that was in
<BR>
power when it got started), and (c) the existence of the surveillance
<BR>
state militates against the effectiveness of the &quot;swim in the sea of
<BR>
the peasants&quot; doctrine -- modern industrial citizens are _not_ anonymous
<BR>
masses and your whereabouts can rapidly be traced by traffic analysis
<BR>
techniques.
<BR>
<P>As one item of comfort, there now exists in the UK a guaranteed
<BR>
untappable, anonymous communications medium that the government _can't_
<BR>
assert control over without causing massive popular discontent. Cheap
<BR>
GSM phones are available on pay-as-you-go tarrifs; you buy the phone,
<BR>
then periodically buy a new SIM card to put in it and keep it running.
<BR>
The cards are sold with a pre-counted number of call minutes of them,
<BR>
so it functions like a callbox. These things are sold over the counter
<BR>
for cash, and there is *no way* of identifying the owner of such a 
<BR>
phone unless they voluntarily register. If you're smart and keep it
<BR>
turned off when not receiving calls -- or use one for outgoing and one
<BR>
for incoming calls -- you have a de facto anonymous phone system.
