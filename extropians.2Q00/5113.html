<EM>&gt; I've kept written journals of my life since I was 13 or 14.  Unfortunately I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; burned the earliest stuff because my mother was going into my room and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reading my private papers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Genuinely sad to hear that, Bonnie. I'm lucky enough to still have
<BR>
everything I've written, and I'm *still* upset I don't have more.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When I read the stuff I wrote when I was in my early 20's, I'm amazed at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how stable my basic philosophy has been over the years.  I'm also amazed at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how my memory of specific events changes over time.  In some cases, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change is due to a new interpretation I give past events as a result of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gaining knowledge I didn't have before. In other cases, I remember certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moments clearly but separately from the context of daily life in which they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were embedded when they occurred.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've given a lot of thought to the extent to which I have remained
<BR>
partly constant, and the unusual phenomenon of being fully aware of
<BR>
ones development (to the point, in fact, where it is possible to fully
<BR>
forsee how you will change over a given subsequent period, and yet still
<BR>
have to actually live through it, breakdowns and all. I don't think this
<BR>
*entirely* a matter of self-fulfilling prophecy).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've loved being a whole series of slightly different people, united by this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basic philosophy.  I sometimes wonder what it would be like if I could have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all these different &quot;selves&quot;--the little child self, the teenaged self, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; young-adult self, etc. in a room with each other at the same time.  I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they'd like each other.  I wonder if anyone has some &quot;selves&quot; that wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get along well with their other &quot;selves.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm proud to say that I believe each of my selves would be pleased
<BR>
with the accomplishments of his successors, so far. And I'm reasonably
<BR>
comfortable with my early selves. In fact, recently I found myself
<BR>
finding a particularly clear pathway back to them.
<BR>
<P>On Millennium Eve [0], just as midnight passed, I recalled quite clearly
<BR>
a moment from when I was eight, looking out of a classroom window with
<BR>
a friend, as it dawned on us the reality that wow, we were going to see
<BR>
the year 2000. I had wondered where I would be at the time...
<BR>
<P><P><P>Martin
<BR>
<P>[0] I was not on this list at that time. No doubt you all joined in the
<BR>
rantings that there was nothing significant about this date, and/or that
<BR>
the new millennium begins in Jan 2001. I was on the same side, but all
<BR>
the same - the event became important *because* people felt that it was.
<BR>
In my case, I had the good fortune to spend it with most of my closest
<BR>
friends for the first time in a long while. Thus, it was a significant
<BR>
turning point.
