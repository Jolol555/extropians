<EM>&gt; &gt; You say the income tax is lower? What are the brackets, the percentages? What are the deductions? What is the cost of living?

<EM>&gt; &gt; Value added tax? ... check

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since when exactly was the level of taxation directly inversely

<EM>&gt; proportional to how 'free' a country is? Unless one is arguing for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system of no taxation and public services at all, the specifics seem

<EM>&gt; somewhat irrelevant.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The specifics are entirely relevant.  First, the amount of taxation
<BR>
essentially determines how much of your labor is slave labor (adjusted for
<BR>
rate of return, but that typically is pretty damn low).  Second, taxation
<BR>
that is tied more closely to service usage is more fair than taxation
<BR>
based on other arbitrary metrics.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Would you cut all taxation? Make all public services optional private ones?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Preferably yes, but at the very least I would prefer to have a use-based
<BR>
tax system.  Not only are use taxes fairer, but they introduce some market
<BR>
mechanics into the government that encourages more efficient and
<BR>
responsive use of tax dollars.
<BR>
<P>For example, the Departments of Transportation of California and Nevada:
<BR>
<P>California:  $400k/year per mile
<BR>
Nevada:  $37k/year per mile
<BR>
<P>These are both government agencies with similar missions, but they operate
<BR>
very differently, get their money from different places, and the results
<BR>
are profoundly different.  It is interesting to note that, while California
<BR>
spends greater than an order of magnitude more money per mile, the roads in
<BR>
Nevada are actually in much better condition in my experience.
<BR>
<P>California DoT gets money from dozens of sources and taxes to the extent
<BR>
that it effectively comes from the General Fund.  Road quality is mediocre
<BR>
and the agency has a reputation for being slow, wasteful, and
<BR>
non-responsive.
<BR>
<P>Nevada DoT gets its money from one source:  gas tax (although gas is
<BR>
actually cheaper in Nevada than in California), which means that their
<BR>
annual budget is determined by how many people drive on their roads and
<BR>
how often they drive.  NDoT is responsive to individual requests and
<BR>
private citizens are routinely involved in their decision making process. 
<BR>
It takes very little effort to get them to fix roads and intersections.  If
<BR>
they have extra resources available (they almost always do), they will
<BR>
upgrade existing roads if an individual makes a phone call (this happened
<BR>
to me -- I was shocked).
<BR>
<P>The difference in these two cases is that the tax revenue of one agency was
<BR>
dependent on its ability to deliver useful services to its customers. 
<BR>
NDoT treats its tax base (people who drive) like a business treats its
<BR>
customers.  CalTrans acts like a government bureaucracy.  I don't mind
<BR>
paying gas taxes in Nevada because I feel like I am getting my money's
<BR>
worth.
<BR>
<P>The point being that as a general rule, organizations are responsive to
<BR>
whoever pays the bills, since whoever pays the bills can refuse to buy
<BR>
the service.  For California DoT, this is the state government. For Nevada
<BR>
DoT, it is the individual people.  If you have to have a tax for
<BR>
government provided services, these direct use-based taxes are definitely
<BR>
better for the people; unfortunately, most tax jurisdictions are *not*
<BR>
setup this way.
