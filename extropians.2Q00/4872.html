Yes, Fortean Times likes to goof with the &quot;other side&quot; of purported 
<BR>
scholarship. Its basically a National Enquirer for psychics.  My only 
<BR>
observations are that David Irving  lost his case in the UK, and that the 
<BR>
testimony given by witnesses both pro and con, appear to convincingly, link 
<BR>
Irving to neo nazi orgs.  He was wont to sing a ditty to his daughter in her 
<BR>
baby carrige, every time a 'person of color' passed him by in the London 
<BR>
streets: &quot;I am white (aryan), not a mongrel Asian or Rastifarian&quot;  
<BR>
<P>My contention with this professor MacDonald, is that how were the Jews able 
<BR>
to accomplish intellectual superiority if over time large amounts of their 
<BR>
genetic composition has been altered over the centuries by  such things as 
<BR>
intermarrige, rape, and conversions in?  If I were to submit over a period of 
<BR>
time the contention that Nordic Europeans were subject to racial degeneration 
<BR>
by &quot;inter-breeding&quot;, I would hope at least some of you fine folks would challe
<BR>
nge this unsubstantiated, notion. Unlike the old German saying &quot;Lies have 
<BR>
short legs&quot; the truth is that lies stand wherever someone buys into them.

&nbsp;We've kicked around Courtney Brown of Emory University, who touts remote

<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Now there's Kevin McDonald of Cal State Long Beach calling Judaism a
<BR>
&nbsp;Darwinian strategy: 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&lt; <A HREF="http://www.newtimesla.com/issues/2000-05-25/faultlines.html">http://www.newtimesla.com/issues/2000-05-25/faultlines.html</A> &gt;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;A few excerpted paragraphs:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;In his books, MacDonald uses an approach called evolutionary
<BR>
&nbsp;psychology to argue that Judaism is not merely a religion; it is also a
<BR>
&nbsp;Darwinian strategy that serves to raise Jewish IQ, and that
<BR>
&nbsp;anti-Semitism can be understood rationally as a by-product of
<BR>
&nbsp;natural selection. He writes that Jews have reacted to
<BR>
&nbsp;anti-Semitism by taking over intellectual movements and attacking
<BR>
&nbsp;Gentile culture to promote Jewish interests. The result, he warns, is
<BR>
&nbsp;a &quot;present decline of European peoples in the New World.&quot; He also
<BR>
&nbsp;asserts that Jews protect their interests by suppressing criticism of
<BR>
&nbsp;Judaism, and cites David Irving as an example of a writer whose
<BR>
&nbsp;work has been suppressed by Jewish groups. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;(...)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Now, MacDonald finds himself immersed in intellectual warfare
<BR>
&nbsp;with his colleagues. His critics are careful to point out that they 
<BR>
&nbsp;believe firmly in MacDonald's academic freedom, and don't 
<BR>
&nbsp;question his right to research what he wants and to continue 
<BR>
&nbsp;teaching at the university. But, says [History Department Chair] 
<BR>
&nbsp;Sievers, professors are determined to make MacDonald answer 
<BR>
&nbsp;for the implications of his theories. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;Faculty can make him uncomfortable. And I think we've made him
<BR>
&nbsp;very uncomfortable. And we're not done yet,&quot; she says. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;History professor Don Schwartz has been one of the most vocal.
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;Academic freedom protects the kind of research that MacDonald
<BR>
&nbsp;is doing. But he's been asked to explain and defend his ideas, and
<BR>
&nbsp;that's a perfectly reasonable expectation,&quot; he says. No one,
<BR>
&nbsp;Schwartz says, is calling for some kind of action that would result in
<BR>
&nbsp;MacDonald's censure or expulsion. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;MacDonald complains that asking him to present his views publicly
<BR>
&nbsp;is not an appropriate thing to ask a tenured professor to do. His
<BR>
&nbsp;theories are too complicated, he argues, for him to present them
<BR>
&nbsp;orally to an audience that is likely to be hostile. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;(...)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Others, Fiebert says, complained that MacDonald's books had
<BR>
&nbsp;already passed peer review, and so it was inappropriate to subject
<BR>
&nbsp;them to further inquiry. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;(...)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Here's what Culture of Critique predicts, after MacDonald has spent
<BR>
&nbsp;nearly 1,000 pages in his trilogy describing the Jewish &quot;evolutionary 
<BR>
&nbsp;strategy,&quot;  which includes denigrating Gentile culture through
<BR>
&nbsp;Jewish-dominated intellectual movements: 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I believe that in the United States we are presently heading down
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a volatile path -- a path that leads to ethnic warfare and to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development of collectivist, authoritarian, and racialist enclaves.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I was especially taken with the ideas that it's 'inappropriate' to ask a
<BR>
&nbsp;tenured professor to publicly explain and defend his views, and to subject
<BR>
&nbsp;peer-reviewed books to further scrutiny.
<BR>

&nbsp;The origin of all science is the desire to know causes, and

&nbsp;the origin of all false science and imposture is the desire to

&nbsp;accept false causes rather than none; or, which is the same

&nbsp;thing, in the unwillingness to acknowledge our own ignorance.
