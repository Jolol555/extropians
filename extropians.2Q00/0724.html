<EM>&gt; Literally by your intepretation, yes, however the US has never brought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an anti-trust suit against a foreign company. Considering the weight of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporate systems like the keiretsu, etc. as monopolistic enterprises, 
</EM><BR>
<P>Out of curiosity, have any of the keiretsu ever achieved a monopoly 
<BR>
position in the USA?
<BR>
<P><P>As I understand it, anti-trust law is applied within a nation-state by
<BR>
that nation-state's government, with respect to the market within that
<BR>
state's jurisdiction. A company can be nailed in a specific country 
<BR>
under anti-trust statutes even if it is based elsewhere -- but its 
<BR>
external headquarters is probably immune to direct action; all it loses
<BR>
is access to that market, or a hefty fine and/or regulation if it wants
<BR>
to continue trading there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fail to see how the Justice department could tolerate a foreign national
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government monopoly bringing anti-trust action against a US corp
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be anti-trust action against a US corp for monopolistic
<BR>
activities in that nation's own jurisdiction. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (especially in light of how nice we have been to the French with their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desire to retain monopoly on the words 'Champagne' and 'Burgundy' for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their particular trade items that have been quite well duplicated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elsewhere.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahem: Champagne and Burgundy are _regions_ of France. Their produce
<BR>
is appelation controlee, meaning it's graded by quality. This is to
<BR>
some extent a hold-over from the agricultural age, and you'll note the
<BR>
tendency to name modern wines by the grape they're produced from -- which
<BR>
isn't a controlled designation.
<BR>
<P>I seem to recall a bit of give and take in this whole argument (which in
<BR>
any case is neither yours nor mine, but a governmental wrangle); for example,
<BR>
Anheur-Busch are still allowed to call their product &quot;Budweiser&quot; in most
<BR>
parts of Europe (although in the Czech republic and Switzerland &quot;Budweiser&quot;
<BR>
is an apellation controlee and AB's product isn't brewed in the right way or
<BR>
the right place to carry the name &quot;Budweiser&quot;).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the French were so keen on developing a 'viable' competition, why did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they not develop a Frogosoft corporation to compete with MS, as they did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to form Airbus to compete with Boeing (interesting Seattle parallel)?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahem. How much of Airbus is government owned? I seem to recall some rather
<BR>
large shareholders that are private companies, like British Aerospace ...
<BR>
<P>I guess you're just sore because Airbus is outselling Boeing 60/40 at
<BR>
present, without the hidden subsidy of military R&amp;D contracts  ;-)
