<EM>&gt;     &gt;You only call these things &quot;the same  location&quot; because your
</EM><BR>
resolution is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;not accurate enough to detect that they  are inches apart.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I've already said if consciousness even has a location (and that's
</EM><BR>
doubtful in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; most cases) it's where its sense data originated. There is no reason two
</EM><BR>
very
<BR>
<EM>&gt; different brains (and I don't give a damn about brain location) could not
</EM><BR>
receive
<BR>
<EM>&gt; identical sense data, hence two consciousness exist at the same place.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was referring to the location of the brain, not the consciousness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; Where did you get the plan  for building a Harvey Newstrom?  From
</EM><BR>
the original.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been making and destroying a billion Harvey Newstroms every second
</EM><BR>
since
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you were a one celled zygote, so you tell me, who is the original Harvey
</EM><BR>
Newstrom?
<BR>
<P>The thing that you copy *from* is the original.  The thing you copy *to* is
<BR>
not the original.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yea yea, &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot;, but just calling it a trick is not good
</EM><BR>
enough unless
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you can explain how the &quot;illusion&quot; works. You haven't done that.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have pointed out many fallacies in your logic.  You redefine terms
<BR>
half-way through an example.  You claim to make a second and third copy, and
<BR>
then later claim that there is only &quot;one&quot; copy.  You claim that the copy
<BR>
thinks and perceives identically to the original, then you claim it was
<BR>
destroyed before it had a single thought.  You claim to reroute sensory data
<BR>
from the original to the copy or from the copy to the original, and then
<BR>
claim there is no such thing as a copy or an original.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; Do you have another term you want to apply to the first copy besides
</EM><BR>
&quot;original&quot;?
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mythical.
</EM><BR>
<P>My current self is the original, since it exists first in time, and it is
<BR>
currently the only instance.  Why do you call this first instance
<BR>
&quot;mythical&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;If you create a body and destroy it so fast that it doesn't have time
</EM><BR>
to have a single
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;thought, then you have failed to recreate my consciousness in a copy.
</EM><BR>
You have
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;changed the definition of the copy from being a functional mind copy
</EM><BR>
to a nonfunctional
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;body copy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not at all, the brain functions as well as ever, it's just that any single
</EM><BR>
copy can't think
<BR>
<EM>&gt; much in 10^-9 seconds. And yet you think, you're conscious, something
</EM><BR>
survives
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that is bigger and more important than any one copy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then I must disagree with your whole premise.  A copy of my brain that is
<BR>
never allowed to think a single thought does not meet my requirements for
<BR>
being &quot;consciouss&quot; at all, much less displaying many attributes of my
<BR>
particular consciousness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;You're not going to claim that the Platonic god-form qualia of
</EM><BR>
&quot;redness&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;is  co-existing in both fruit, are you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certainly not! I'd never say such a thing, a tomato is a vegetable not a
</EM><BR>
fruit.
<BR>
<P>It's a fruit!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;Is your whole claim of duplicates being a single object based on
</EM><BR>
quantam
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;many-worlds, qualia, Platonic forms, mystic souls, or anything else
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;can't be defined by atoms and energy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do claim that some things are very real but are neither atoms nor
</EM><BR>
energy, like
<BR>
<EM>&gt; redness or thought or 17 or consciousness or any adjective.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we agree on this.  I just think that redness derives from the atomic
<BR>
structure of the fruit which reflects certain wavelengths of light energy.
<BR>
The quality is therefore generated by the atoms and energy.  If you try to
<BR>
ignore the atoms and energy, and just try to have &quot;redness&quot; exist by itself
<BR>
without any reliance on the real world, you are defining a mystical soul.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; I don't see where we disagree on any objective facts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We disagree on subjective facts, I think they can probably be deduced
</EM><BR>
pretty
<BR>
<EM>&gt; well by studying objective facts,  you don't.
</EM><BR>
<P>I still see the real question as a semantic one.  You label two computers
<BR>
running the same process as &quot;one&quot; process in two bodies.  I label two
<BR>
computers running the same process as &quot;two&quot; identical processes in two
<BR>
bodies.  We disagree on the labels.  I think we agree on all the atoms and
<BR>
energies involved, and both predict the same outcomes for every experiment.
<BR>
We just disagree on what to call these outcomes.
