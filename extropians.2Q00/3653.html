<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Assuming he gets elected...  But the problem is,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; a Conservative Court is no friend to freedom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; in general.  Surely, we might -- ah, might!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; -- get some gun control removed, but in other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; areas, such as police power, we might have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; more freedoms curtailed.
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt; Indeed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Speaking of which, I would think the U.S.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; presidential election choice would be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; difficult one for an Extropian. On the one hand,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; you have the obvious ZOG-type problems with Gore,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; but on the other hand, you have, with Bush, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; just the potential for expanded police powers (which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; doesn't bother me too much), but also the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; possibility of severe restrictions in stem cell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; research -- and not just the federal funding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; thereof.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Molly Ivins wrote a book about Dubya called &quot;Shrub&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In it she detailed how the fundamentalists that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got Bush elected to the Texas Governorship wound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up with a lot less than they bargained for, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the end wound up just being happy that &quot;THAT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; woman&quot; was no longer the Governor (Anne Richards).
</EM><BR>
<P><P>We'll see (well, most likely: stupid but charming Republican
<BR>
generally beats smart but phlegmatic Democrat).
<BR>
<P>It's an important question. My concern with Bush is that not
<BR>
only might there be even greater restrictions on federal funding
<BR>
of stem cell (and related) research, but there might even be
<BR>
greater restrictions on what can happen in the private sector.
<BR>
The former restrictions might not have a huge impact, if the
<BR>
economy continues to perform well, but the latter would be
<BR>
devastating. With relatively few restrictions, we could have
<BR>
radical life-extension technology available REALLY soon.
<BR>
<P>The few things Bush has so far said on this make me think that
<BR>
voting for him may mean suicide. Literally. (Depends on a LOT of
<BR>
other factors, of course.)
<BR>
<P>But maybe he'll change his tune once he's elected (as in Austin,
<BR>
per Ivins).
<BR>
<P>Difficult.
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
Brian.
