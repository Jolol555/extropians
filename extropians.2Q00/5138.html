<BR>
<EM>&gt; What makes you think antitrust law is an improvement? As I've already said,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the market does tend to correct these situations on its own, and government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intervention dramatically undermines the natural corrective process. I want a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good argument for thinking antitrust laws will be better than the markets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; natural corrective mechanisms (and, since we are also trampling on private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property rights and inviting a morass of anti-competitive regulation, it needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be a very good argument).
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is perfectly reasonable - once a problem is identified and a
<BR>
verdict is reached (putting aside how that happens) there must be a
<BR>
heavy burden on the plaintiff not only to demonstrate that the remedy
<BR>
he proposes will in fact be a an improvement on leaving the market
<BR>
alone, but also to demonstrate that no less intrusive a solution can
<BR>
suffice. This is exactly the sort of argument we'll be seeing when MS
<BR>
goes before the appeals court - they'll be arguing over the facts,
<BR>
whether the conclusions of law are tenable and supported by those
<BR>
facts, and over whether the remedy appropriately and minimally
<BR>
addresses the proven violations. It'll be interesting to watch - I
<BR>
wouldn't be surprised if the breakup itself gets dropped, but stuff
<BR>
like uniform pricing across the major hardware vendors, be they friend
<BR>
or foe, is likely to prove defensible.
<BR>
<P>(On a bit of a tangent, consider this: For what values of N is the
<BR>
following proposition true? 'It is better to let N guilty men go free
<BR>
than put one innocent man in prison.')
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; And it's absurd to equate antitrust with a system where government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; arbitrarily interferes with every contract and the terms of every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; business agreement. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why is it absurd? Unless you have  avery strong demarcation between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permissible and impermissible interventions, a government agency charged with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcing antitrust law will naturally become more and more interventionist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over time. The end result is someting like the SCC regulation of commodity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trading - an omnipresent blanket of senseless regulation that strangles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything it touches.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's as absurd as saying prosecuting violent criminals will inevitably
<BR>
lead to random Brazil-style kidnapping and arbitrary executions. (Though 
<BR>
there seems to be a vocal contingent on this list that doesn't see any 
<BR>
middle ground between a police state and anarchy.) Like I said above, there 
<BR>
must be a heavy burden of proof. But if that burden can be met, then 
<BR>
intervention is justified. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes. And before we pass such a law, we should demand actual evidence that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make things better. Almost our entire current regulatory regime was enacted on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing more substantial that wishful thinking, (or worse, a blind urge to &quot;do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something&quot; in order to curry favor and/or look important) and almost all of it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does more harm than good.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't necessarily disagree with that sentiment, at least in some
<BR>
areas. Drug policy is the example that most most readily to mind. 
<BR>
But in this case the solution is better antitrust law, not scrapping
<BR>
it all together. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Do you find not being able to yell fire in a crowded theater an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ominous trend? There's nothing arbitrary or senseless about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ruling, disagree with it though you might. Whether it's expensive, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whether it'll just be another MS stock split, only time can tell.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I call the MS ruling arbitrary and senseless because it is not based on any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sort of objective standard. If I don't want ot be arrested for shouting &quot;fire&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a crowded thatre, all I have to do is refrain from doing so. In contrast,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is no course of action Microsoft could have taken that would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protected it form an antitrust suit. The laws are so vauge that a hostile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; judge can plausibly find any successful business guilty of 'illegal'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activities, and impose pretty much any penalty he feels like levying. That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't justice.
</EM><BR>
<P>If MS can show Jackson's ruling was unjustified then it'll be over
<BR>
turned - that's why we have an appeals process. MS has yet to
<BR>
acknowledge they did _anything_ wrong, so barring a major reversal we
<BR>
can expect them to bring it all the way to the Supreme Court. If the
<BR>
issues you raise about the coherence / well-formedness of the law hold
<BR>
water, they'll probably take it.
