<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds nice.  But the minute you hold the state to the same standard as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; individuals, the state gives up all police power (except in those few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; circumstances were governmental employees or property are harmed or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; threatened) and all prisons must be emptied.  That might sound like a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; thing to you, but the day it happens here is the day I move to Costa
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Rica.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Actually, this is not true. The only greater authority police have that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't have is the ability to give traffic tickets, and in some states,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;arrest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for misdemeanor offenses. We are all authorized and responsible to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;apprehend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;criminals committing felonies, and in the face of threat of deadly force,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;unarmed individuals present, lethal force is generally legal, though there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;differing thresholds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well yes, and no.  In California if you're not a cop, you'd better be *darn*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sure that the suspect is guilty, especially if you resort to deadly force,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because if the suspect you shoot is not actually guilty of a felony you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up a creek.  Even if you use non-deadly force you had better be sure that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crime has in fact been committed and you had better have &quot;reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grounds&quot; to belive that the suspect you arrested is the actual perp.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Short of this, you are just opening yourself up to being sued (and possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criminally charged) for assault, battery and false imprisonment.  All in all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I say you're better off just calling 911.
</EM><BR>
<P>These are standards no different than what cops face every day. If you
<BR>
witness the crime, you are considered responsible to affect an arrest.
