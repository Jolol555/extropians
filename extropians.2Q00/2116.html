<EM>&gt;From: <A HREF="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Moravec%20article%20available&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000503020115.45362.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Robin forwards Moravec:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; An
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; immortal cannot hope to survive unchanged, only to maintain a limited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; continuity over the short run. Personal death differs from this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; inevitability only in its relative abruptness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is a dilemma, but I'm not sure I agree with Moravec's experession
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of it.  He suggests that change will be forced on us by evolution and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;competition, leading to some inevitable common outcome.  This would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a sort of monocultural climax ecosystem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However we see here on Earth a diverse ecology which includes organisms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that cover a wide spectrum of rates of adaption.  There are species
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which are almost unchanged from hundreds of millions of years ago,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and others which are less than a million years old.  This suggests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the ultimate end point is not necessarily the same for everyone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but may include similar degrees of diversity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In that case we have a choice, not between adapt or perish, but between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;adapt or stagnate.  It may turn out that there is an ecological niche
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for organisms who are wedded to their past, who refuse to change.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Their very stubbornness will become their raison d'etre.  They are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;monuments to themselves, as unchanging as stone.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is not a very appealing picture for Extropians, but it does seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the alternative leads to the kind of outcome Moravec describes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Even if we embrace change, not because the universe forces it upon us,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but for our own philosophical reasons, the outcome may be much the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in either case.  We will become unrecognizable to ourselves, like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;character in Egan's Diaspora who had rewritten himself so many times he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;considered himself his own grandchild.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It is still a more optimistic picture than Moravec's, because even if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we change as much or more than when we die, it is still our own choice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and our own path.  His more pessimistic view assumes that the path is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not ours to choose, that competition is so harsh that we have no control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;over where we end up.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't take Moravec's outlook to be nearly so pessimistic as you seem to.  
<BR>
I think the &quot;problem&quot; you may be having with his picture is the seeming 
<BR>
equivolence he suggests between change and death.  When I look back at who I 
<BR>
was, say, 10 or 20 years ago, that person no longer exists.  He has changed 
<BR>
a great deal to become the person I am today.  In a sense you could say that 
<BR>
the &quot;me&quot; of 20 years ago is dead, because he is just as non-existent today 
<BR>
as if I had died 20 years ago.
<BR>
<P>I believe this is more like what Moravec has in mind.  No matter how it 
<BR>
happens, if you live long enough, you are bound to change significantly, 
<BR>
albeit perhaps fairly gradually.  The only way for you to be the same person 
<BR>
100 years from now (not to mention 100,000 years from now), would be for you 
<BR>
to lock yourself away from the rest of the world and to severely limit your 
<BR>
experience of life.  If you're going to live like that why on Earth would 
<BR>
you want to live forever?
<BR>
<P>Plus, when you add such things as drastically improved human-machine 
<BR>
interfaces, neural implants and/or modifications, mind-uploading, telepathic 
<BR>
technology, ubiquitous, wireless &quot;always on&quot; ultra-high bandwidth 
<BR>
human-machine and human-human network connections, there seems little doubt 
<BR>
that, if you find yourself still living 100 years from now chances are that 
<BR>
the &quot;you&quot; of 100 years from now will be so different from the &quot;you&quot; of 
<BR>
today, that you will agree that the &quot;you&quot; of today is effectively &quot;dead&quot;.  
<BR>
However, I don't think that will be cause for mourning.  Instead it will be 
<BR>
cause for celebration.
