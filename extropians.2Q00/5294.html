<P><EM>&gt;Poverty has multiple causes, not all of which will automatically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be eradicated by free markets. But governments usually make things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worse. The welfare system (especially in Europe) has perpetuated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;poverty by subidizing it. State schooling which stifles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;competition for good education works especially badly in poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neighborhoods. There's a clear correlation between degree of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;education and income (though it's not perfect). Putting some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;competition into the (pre-university school system would immensely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;help the least well off gain real skills that can help them in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life. It would also make my part-time college teaching more fun.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm frustrated that in philosophy classes I have to first explain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;factual basics (whether in physics, biology, or finance) before I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can even tackle the philosophical issues. The United States still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has a rigid industrial style of education in an information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;economy.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that free markets are not an automatic cure for poverty,
<BR>
which as Max has pointed out has multiple causes. The effectiveness
<BR>
of the government being an important one. But I believe free
<BR>
markets supported by a democratic/republic are the best way of
<BR>
getting there.
<BR>
<P>I also agree that our education system isn't what it should be,
<BR>
which has lead to my interest in hyperlearning systems.
<BR>
<P>I just had an interesting idea for your class Max. You were
<BR>
mentioning how your students lacked many of the fundamentals, what
<BR>
if you gave an initial test of some of the basics that a potential
<BR>
student would have to pass in order to take your class?
<BR>
<P>Probably a political nightmare for the school, but it would make an
<BR>
interesting point.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;In the &quot;Third World&quot; (an increasingly outdated term), the state is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;usually pervasive, or else fails in the job it has taken on of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enforcing the rule of law, thereby making markets ineffective, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;making it hard to get out of poverty--unless you can become one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the rulers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agree completely.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Free markets are not the whole answer. Some unfortunate people do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;poorly  because of psychological disorders. Extropians of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benevolent disposition look forward to a time when medicine has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advanced to the point where Prozac and Zanax will look as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;primitive as ECT, and we can truly offer people the chance to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;function effectively.
</EM><BR>
<P>Free markets populated by benevolent people who live below their
<BR>
means would have sufficient resources to help those less fortunate.
