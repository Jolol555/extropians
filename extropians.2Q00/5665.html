<EM>&gt;Subject: Re: You may not believe in God but She still believes in you,
</EM><BR>
most of the time
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My apologies if I offended you or any other who describe themselves as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;atheists. My error, I think, is due to cross definitions. It has always been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my understanding that atheism was the claim that &quot;God does not exist&quot; while 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;agnosticism was &quot;we make no claim about Godhood&quot;. I again apologize for my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;misunderstanding. However, this not being the case, what then is an agnostic?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Respectfully,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ronin Cuervo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;In this life he's filled with all these good intentions, but he's lived a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lot of things he'd rather not mention.&quot; - Be Like That, 3 Doors Down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Ronin,
<BR>
<P>Apology graciously given, and graciously accepted.  My apologies in return
<BR>
if I seemed abrupt, I was merely &quot;attacking&quot; your statement, not yourself.
<BR>
<P>Your misunderstanding is quite understandible, as for most people their
<BR>
definintion of Atheism has a Theistic source, and can be subject to
<BR>
&quot;distortion&quot; as you can imagine.  It sounds as though your definition for
<BR>
Agnosticism given above is a possible definition for Atheism (the default
<BR>
variety of it)  A far better definition of Agnosticism than I can muster
<BR>
has been posted here, so I'll leave it at that.
<BR>
<P>Another definition often applied wrongly to Atheism is that they &quot;deny the
<BR>
existence of God&quot;, which of course is a presumption of God to begin with,
<BR>
topped off with an accusation of Atheists as being in a kind of God denial. 
<BR>
<P>My own reasons for my Atheism in order of importance (if anyone's even
<BR>
interested!:) are twofold;
<BR>
1)  Lack of evidence for Theism, and mountain of evidence for alternative
<BR>
(Science-derived) theories.
<BR>
2)  Horror upon seeing justifications for and acceptance of, many crimes in
<BR>
various parts of the bible, and consequent use of these even in todays world.
<BR>
<P>I guess most Atheists would state these two reasons (more or less) for
<BR>
their stance.
<BR>
<P>My 2.08 Euros worth:)
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P><P><P>James.....
