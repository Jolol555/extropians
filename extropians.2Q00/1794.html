<P><EM>    &gt;John, you and I sitting here couldn't possibly account for all of the technological
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;carryovers from the stealth  program to civilian industry.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh I bet we could and I don't think it would take very long either, I mean the damn thing
<BR>
was top secret and didn't even officially exist until 1988 or 89. And who but the government
<BR>
could afford gold plated, or rather, solid gold priced paint primers or adhesives.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;The electroluminescent laptop display found in many laptop computers was developed for
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the stealth bomber
</EM><BR>
<P>I could be wrong but I really doubt that's true.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Every chip we currently use is based on original generation designs that needed
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;to be compact, durable, and light for use in many military applications, from
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;air-to-air missiles to ICBMs to torpedos and tanks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not quite. Bell Labs funded research on transistors because they wanted a better
<BR>
way to amplify signals on their transatlantic cables, the government wasn't involved.
<BR>
Texas Instruments and Fairchild Semiconductor invented the integrated circuit
<BR>
by researchers who just thought the research would be fun, they didn't even have
<BR>
the full backing of their own companies much less a government contract, they did
<BR>
most of their work late at night and on weekends. INTEL invented the
<BR>
microprocessor to fulfill a contract from a Japanese calculator company and had
<BR>
nothing to do with the military.
<BR>
<P>I don't mean to say military research has never come up with something useful,
<BR>
but considering the fact that you'd need to use scientific notation to talk about
<BR>
the money spent the results have been extremely disappointing.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;No weather satellites, no communications satellites, no space probes, and no Iridium.
</EM><BR>
<P>Iridium?! Ah Mike, do you really want credit for Iridium?
