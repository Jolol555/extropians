Emlyn, what I'm working on are food production methods that are driven by
<BR>
direct solar energy rather than any sort of oxidation process, whether it be
<BR>
the burning of fossil fuel, alcohol, or glucose (in human or animal
<BR>
muscles).  I don't see any point in burning petroleum when there are so many
<BR>
other and more interesting uses for it.  Nor do I see any reason to do more
<BR>
work than  necessary. (When I say direct use of solar energy, I mean the
<BR>
storage of solar energy via photosynthesis.)
<BR>
<P>I don't buy the theory that population has driven the invention of new
<BR>
technologies of food production, though population pressure has surely
<BR>
driven the spread of technology.  Starving people don't typically invent new
<BR>
technologies.
<BR>
<P>One of the principles I work by is the following:  &quot;The yield of a system is
<BR>
theoretically unlimited.  The only limit on the number of uses of a resource
<BR>
possible within a system is in the limit of the information and the
<BR>
imagination of the designer.&quot;

From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20Extropian%20Principles&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGEEJOFDAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>
<BR>
<P>The yardstick when comparing technology through the ages, and across
<BR>
cultures, is food production technology; something like kilojoules/hectare,
<BR>
or number of people supported/hectare. Thus we have hunter-gatherer, simple
<BR>
&amp; intensive horticulturalists, agrarian societies, all defined in terms of
<BR>
their food technology. Food production is arguably the number one area of
<BR>
technology (or has been to date); as people adopt &quot;higher&quot; technologies for
<BR>
food production (which have traditionally required each person to work
<BR>
harder than before), you get order of magnitude changes in population, and
<BR>
societies nearby these technology adopters either follow suit or are crushed
<BR>
by the advancing wave (in relative terms) of humanity. In fact, there is
<BR>
strong argument that population has driven technology (you only adopt these
<BR>
'orrible new food production technologies when you ave no alternative) which
<BR>
in turn drives population up further, and so on.
<BR>
<P>This is why I recently suggested to Damien that maybe Extropians should be
<BR>
having more children, and urging others to have more children likewise;
<BR>
population pressure will ultimately push us to technological &quot;progress&quot;,
<BR>
just to cope. And it will be all about living space, and food. For instance,
<BR>
the only way to cope with more mouths might involve nanotechnology
<BR>
solutions, and so they will be found. A good thing.
<BR>
<P>Emlyn, breeder
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The following sentences are from Extropian Principles Version 3.0:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Transhumanists take humanism further by challenging human limits by means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of science and technology combined with critical and creative thinking.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;This document deliberately does not specify particular beliefs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technologies, or conclusions.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The document doesn't offer a definition of technology; therefore, it seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; safe to assume that for the purpose of interpreting the document the word
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to be defined according to its generally accepted definition.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dictionary I have sitting here on the shelf behind my desk (Webster's 9th
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; New Collegiate) offers a definition of technology which I think is
</EM><BR>
relevant
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to a recent post by Robert-Coyote which implies that the means used to
</EM><BR>
grow
<BR>
<EM>&gt; food crops should not be considered technology.  Here's the definition:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology:  the totality of the means employed to provide objects
</EM><BR>
necessary
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for human sustenance and comfort.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, Robert-Coyote, I'm wondering why you think that the means to grow food
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in beach sand with no fossil fuel consumed and without adding shipped-in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fertilisers, does not qualify as technology.  The predominate method of
</EM><BR>
food
<BR>
<EM>&gt; production used these days requires an input of several calories of fossil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fuel for each calorie of food obtained (including the manufacture,
</EM><BR>
shipping,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and operation of farm equipment &amp; the manufacture, shipping, and handling
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fertilisers and pesticides, the figure's between 3 and 5 calories input
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; every 1 calorie obtained--and I apologize for not having references for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these figures handy.  I'm looking through my stuff trying to find some).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is not good economics. It's a lousy technology, and from what I've
</EM><BR>
seen
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of most of the molecular-genetic technology being marketed, some of it
</EM><BR>
will
<BR>
<EM>&gt; help some, but it's not gonna change an overall lousy technology into a
</EM><BR>
good
<BR>
<EM>&gt; one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now you might argue that trans-humans won't need food.  And maybe at some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point they won't.  But I'll bet YOU do, and it's a safe bet that everyone
</EM><BR>
on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; this list needs food in order to stay alive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You might also argue that the only &quot;true&quot; technology is that which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developed in highly funded labs using all the latest high-dollar
</EM><BR>
equipment.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect this is what you believe. I think you're wrong about this and
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the research I'm doing will likely be more valuable as a means of
</EM><BR>
sustaining
<BR>
<EM>&gt; human (or early trans-human) life than much of what's touted as &quot;high
</EM><BR>
tech.&quot;
