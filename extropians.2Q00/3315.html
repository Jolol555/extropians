<EM>&gt; &gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Question: I've been making and destroying a billion Harvey Newstroms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; every second since you were a one celled zygote, so you tell me, who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is the original Harvey Newstrom?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lee@piclab.com?Subject=Re:%20Is%20the%20fourth%20%20time%20is%20the%20charm?&In-Reply-To=&lt;001f01bfc0ee$1daba1c0$13b84d0c@flrjs&gt;">lee@piclab.com</A> Wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; For what definition of &quot;original&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>You tell me, it's not my term, Harvey is the one who thinks it's cosmically
<BR>
important, I think it's nonsense.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;For what definition of &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>Harvey Newstrom needs no such definition, he has something much much
<BR>
better, an example. Definitions are seldom important in life and certainly
<BR>
not in this case.
