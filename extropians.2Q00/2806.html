<EM>&gt; &gt;  No matter how maliciously we choose to wield our growing power over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we can never begin to approach in capriciousness and sheer mind-boggling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; indifference the actions displayed by nature herself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yet our lives and deaths are simply a part of that beautiful symphony
</EM><BR>
called
<BR>
<EM>&gt; nature.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If we weild increasing power over &quot;her&quot; we are simply wielding increasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power over our own actions, not some being that has lack of emotion over
</EM><BR>
us
<BR>
<EM>&gt; separate and indifferent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sadness and anger are natural emotions in an occurance such as a loved
</EM><BR>
one's
<BR>
<EM>&gt; death. A word of caution however: What we cannot control, we must not
</EM><BR>
deride
<BR>
<EM>&gt; as cruel intention. To imagine we can gain control over everything and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone may only serve to cause us great pain.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have lazily taken on poetic license by portratying Nature as a being, a
<BR>
designer. I want to take that back, because that is not how I see it at all.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Nature&quot; is the sum of the mindless processes that govern the universe.
<BR>
Little rules make big complex systems, and the universe that we see, and the
<BR>
biosphere of this planet as a subset, are objects of the most awe-inspiring
<BR>
beauty, I will agree. To imagine the whole is to tremble before an entirely
<BR>
profound greatness that we cannot hope to approach.
<BR>
<P>Yet it is a mindless greatness, which is the important point. This amazing
<BR>
whirling machine of which we are part has no designer, no director. Thus, it
<BR>
does not care for us; indeed it cannot. We are entirely side-effects of a
<BR>
much larger process, whose sense of identity and importance is not shared by
<BR>
the system in which we exist.
<BR>
<P>I think the term &quot;nature&quot; is a bad one, because it is loaded with warm,
<BR>
fuzzy memes about protection, nurturing, all things benign and lovely.
<BR>
Nothing could be futher from the truth! We exist at the mercy of the
<BR>
universe, an abbaration that can be nothing other than temporary, a
<BR>
momentary local emergence of complex order in the flows, a fragile
<BR>
attractor, gone as suddenly as it appears.
<BR>
<P>A better term is &quot;Default&quot;. Substitute &quot;Default&quot; everywhere you might use
<BR>
the term &quot;Nature&quot;. The &quot;Default&quot; is many things; complex, profoundly
<BR>
beautiful, in many ways beyond our ken. But it cannot care; it's just the
<BR>
default.
<BR>
<P>We differ in that we care. We care about ourselves, about our own continued
<BR>
existence, as petty and insignificant as we may be in this maelstrom. It is
<BR>
important to grasp that we, alone, have this care. No one is looking out for
<BR>
us. There is no &quot;grand plan&quot; of the &quot;default&quot; to build humanity and nuture
<BR>
us in some kind of garden of eden. Planning is invented by sentients.
<BR>
<P>The term &quot;Default&quot; emphasises two important points:
<BR>
1 - there is no designer. While you can talk of &quot;nature's plan&quot;
<BR>
(erroneously), &quot;the &quot;Default's plan&quot; makes no sense.
<BR>
2 - we can change it. Sure, we don't know what we are doing, we break stuff,
<BR>
and we do nasty things to each other. But we continue, we learn, and we
<BR>
grow. There would certainly not be six billion people on this planet if we
<BR>
left it up to &quot;the default&quot;.
<BR>
<P>There can be no moral objection. The universe (or such of it as is unclaimed
<BR>
by other sentients) is ownerless, terra nullius. Natural Law is a lie. We
<BR>
are, and beyond that all is anthropocentricity. If we break nature, it is on
<BR>
our heads, but there is no one else who suffers. If we don't hack nature, we
<BR>
die, and the mindless machine whirls on, unnapreciated and unaware.
<BR>
<P>I don't imagine for one minute that we can control everything. But we can
<BR>
control something, many things. We can direct ourselves, and we must. No one
<BR>
else will. Nature be damned.
