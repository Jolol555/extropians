<EM>&gt; BUT:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I started the whole thing for one reason: Why would you tell a sweet person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like Bonnie, who is new, and learning, and expressing herself,  that she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should LURK?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey, thats like saying she isn't welcome to post here until she &quot;does some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more homework&quot;.

<P>I don't want to get into a newbies vs. the old codgers thread. There have
<BR>
been discussions before about restricting posting to only ExI members,
<BR>
but that was shot down in favor of making the nodes. I would just point
<BR>
out that recently someone posted a list of people who used to be on the list-
<BR>
where did they go and more importantly why? There certainly are two things
<BR>
I can think of, both of which are helped by cutting down on newbie posts:
<BR>
endless rehashing of previous discussions, and overall too many posts per
<BR>
day on the list for some people to be able to digest. We can go on and on
<BR>
that people should use better email readers with killfiles, etc. etc. You
<BR>
can if you want to. I just wanted get this off my chest.
<BR>
<P>P.S. I did not intend to mean that she should _only_ lurk. In fact I think
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encouraged her to ask questions.
<BR>
<P>P.P.S. regarding your comment that boundless expression would not imply
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we would be physically growing.. I have to ask you: where are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you going to store all your ever-expanding abilities and memories?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point your physical size will start expanding just in order
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to keep up with your mental storage needs. (this assuming you get
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uploaded into a digital system) At some point you might need a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jupiter sized storage system just for all your stuff.
