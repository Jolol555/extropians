<P>
Who owns the roads?
<BR>
<P><P>Jurisdiction over interstate commerce is reserved
<BR>
to Congress, and must be delegated to the State.
<BR>
<P><P>“It is in the 8th section of the second article, we are to look for cessions 
<BR>
of territory and of exclusive jurisdiction.”
<BR>
<P>“Congress may pass all laws which are necessary and proper for giving the 
<BR>
most complete effect to this power. Still, the general jurisdiction over the 
<BR>
place, subject to this grant of power, adheres to the territory, as a 
<BR>
portion of sovereignty not yet given away.”
<BR>
<P>“Consistent with this structure, we have identified three broad categories 
<BR>
of activity that congress may regulate under its commerce power. (Cites 
<BR>
omitted) First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate 
<BR>
commerce. (Cites omitted) (“‘[T]he authority of Congress to keep the 
<BR>
channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses has 
<BR>
been frequently sustained, and is no longer open to question.’” (quoting 
<BR>
Carminetti v. United States, 242 U.S. 470, 491, 37 S.Ct. 192, 197, 61 L.Ed. 
<BR>
442 (1917)) Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the 
<BR>
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate 
<BR>
commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. 
<BR>
(Cites omitted) Finally, Congress’ commerce authority includes the power to 
<BR>
regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate 
<BR>
commerce, (Cites omitted) those activities that substantially affect 
<BR>
interstate commerce. (Cite omitted)”
<BR>
<P>“We do not say that a case may not arise in which it will be found that a 
<BR>
State, under the form of regulating its own affairs, has encroached upon the 
<BR>
exclusive domain of Congress in respect to interstate commerce…”
<BR>
<P>“But we think it may safely be said that State legislation which seeks to 
<BR>
impose a direct burden upon interstate commerce, or to interfere directly 
<BR>
with its freedom, does encroach upon the exclusive power of Congress.”
<BR>
<P>“It is impossible to see any distinction in its effect upon commerce of 
<BR>
either class, between a statute which regulates the charges for 
<BR>
transportation, and a statute which levies a tax for the benefit of the 
<BR>
State upon the same transportation; and, in fact, the judgment of the court 
<BR>
in  the State Freight Tax Case, 15 Wall. 232, rested upon the ground that 
<BR>
the tax was always added to the cost of transportation, and thus was a tax 
<BR>
upon the privilege of carrying the goods through the State.”
<BR>
<P>“It is not the railroads themselves that are regulated by this act of the 
<BR>
Illinois Legislature so much as the charge for transportation, and, in the 
<BR>
language just cited, of each one of the States through whose territories 
<BR>
these goods are transported can fix its own rules for prices, for modes of 
<BR>
transit, for times and modes of delivery, and all the other incidents of 
<BR>
transportation to which the word “regulation” can be applied, it is readily 
<BR>
seen that the embarrassments upon interstate transportation, as an element 
<BR>
of interstate commerce, might be too oppressive to be submitted to. “It 
<BR>
was,” in the language of the court cited above, “to meet just such a case 
<BR>
that the commerce clause of the Constitution was adopted.”
<BR>
<P>“As such, so far as it operates on private messages sent out of the State, 
<BR>
it is a regulation of foreign and interstate commerce and beyond the power 
<BR>
of the State. That is fully established by the cases already cited.”
<BR>
<P>“Commerce with foreign countries and among the States, strictly considered, 
<BR>
consists in intercourse and traffic, including in these terms navigation and 
<BR>
the transportation and transit of persons and property, as well as the 
<BR>
purchase, sale, and exchange of commodities. For the regulation of commerce 
<BR>
as thus defined there can be only one system of rules, applicable alike to 
<BR>
the whole country; and the authority that can act for the whole country can 
<BR>
alone adopt such a system. Action upon it by separate States is not, 
<BR>
therefore, permissible. Language confirming the exclusiveness of the grant 
<BR>
of power over commerce as thus defined may not be inaccurate, when it would 
<BR>
be so applied to legislation upon subjects which are merely auxiliary to 
<BR>
commerce.”
<BR>
<P>“And if it be a regulation of commerce, …it must be of that national 
<BR>
character, and the regulation can only appropriately exist by general rules 
<BR>
and principles, which demand that it should be done by the Congress of the 
<BR>
United States under the commerce clause of the Constitution.”
<BR>
<P>“The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 requires all States to meet 
<BR>
the same minimum standards for testing and licensing commercial drivers. All 
<BR>
commercial drivers throughout the United States are required to have a 
<BR>
Commercial Driver’s License (CDL).”
<BR>
<P>“…the grant [the commerce clause] established the immunity of interstate 
<BR>
commerce from the control of the States respecting all those subjects 
<BR>
embraced within the grant which are of such a nature as to demand that, if 
<BR>
regulated at all, their regulation must be prescribed by a single 
<BR>
authority.” Milk Control Board v. Eisenberg Farm Products, 306 U.S. 346, 
<BR>
351.”
<BR>
<P>“The right to move freely from State to State is an incident of national 
<BR>
citizenship protected by the privileges and immunities clause of the 
<BR>
Fourteenth Amendment against state interference. Mr. Justice Moody in 
<BR>
Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78, 97, stated, “Privileges and immunities 
<BR>
of citizens of the United States … are only such as arise out of the nature 
<BR>
and essential character of the National Government, or are specifically 
<BR>
granted or secured to all citizens or persons by the Constitution of the 
<BR>
United States.” And went on to state that one of those rights of national 
<BR>
citizenship was “the right to pass freely from State to State.” Id. P.97.”
<BR>
<P>“…But [Mr. Justice Miller in Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35 (1867)]’s 
<BR>
failure to classify that right as one of state citizenship underscores his 
<BR>
view that the free movement of persons throughout this nation was a right of 
<BR>
national citizenship.”
<BR>
<P>“…Thus it is plain that the right of free ingress and egress rises to a 
<BR>
higher constitutional dignity than that afforded by state citizenship.”
<BR>
<P><P><P>RCW “46.30.010 Legislative intent. It is a privilege granted by the state to 
<BR>
operate a motor vehicle upon the highways of this state.”
<BR>
<P>Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition:
<BR>
“Privilege. A particular and peculiar benefit or advantage enjoyed by a 
<BR>
person, company, or class, beyond the common advantages of other citizens. 
<BR>
An exceptional or extraordinary  power or exemption. A peculiar right, 
<BR>
advantage, exemption, power, franchise, or immunity held by a person or 
<BR>
class, not generally possessed by others.”
<BR>
<P>“License. A personal privilege to do some particular act or series of acts 
<BR>
on land without possessing any estate or interest therein, and is ordinarily 
<BR>
revocable at the will of the licensor and is not assignable. (Cite omitted) 
<BR>
The permission by competent authority to do an act which, without such 
<BR>
permission, would be illegal, a trespass,  a tort, or otherwise not 
<BR>
allowable.”
<BR>
<P>“Easement. A right of use over the property of another.”
<BR>
<P>“Private or public easements. A private easement is one in which the 
<BR>
enjoyment is restricted to one or a few individuals, while a public easement 
<BR>
is one the right to enjoyment of which is vested in the public generally or 
<BR>
in an entire community; such as an easement of passage on the public streets 
<BR>
and highways or of navigation on a stream.”
<BR>
<P><P>“Having regard to form alone, the act here is an offer to the private 
<BR>
carrier of a privilege, which the state may grant or deny, upon a condition 
<BR>
which the carrier is free to accept or reject. In reality, the carrier is 
<BR>
given no choice, except a choice between the rock and the whirlpool-an 
<BR>
option to forgo a privilege which may be vital to his livelihood or submit 
<BR>
to a requirement which may constitute an intolerable burden.”
<BR>
<P>2.9 Congress’ exclusive authority and original jurisdiction over the

Defendant’s use of the highways, and the Plaintiff’s lack of original

having been firmly established, Defendant will proceed.

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.14 It is clear that the legislative body with the exclusive 2.17 The 
<BR>
Constitution for Washington state does bestow some authority upon the 
<BR>
legislature to regulate the activities upon the highways, and does so under 
<BR>
Article 12, § 13 which reads as follows:
<BR>
<P>“All railroad, canal and other transportation companies are declared to be 
<BR>
common carriers and subject to legislative control. Any association or 
<BR>
corporation organized for the purpose, under the laws of this state, shall 
<BR>
have the right to connect at the state line with railroads of other states. 
<BR>
Every railroad company shall have the right with its road, whether the same 
<BR>
be now constructed or may hereafter be constructed, to intersect, cross or 
<BR>
connect with any other railroad, and when such railroads are of the same or 
<BR>
similar gauge they shall at all crossings and at all points, where a 
<BR>
railroad shall begin or terminate at or near any other railroad, form proper 
<BR>
connections so that the cars of any such railroad companies may be speedily 
<BR>
transferred from one railroad to another. All railroad companies shall 
<BR>
receive and transport each the other's passengers, tonnage and cars without 
<BR>
delay or discrimination.
<BR>
<P><P>RCW 46.98.020 Provisions to be construed in pari materia.
<BR>
The provisions of this title shall be construed in pari materia even though 
<BR>
as a matter of prior legislative history they were not originally enacted in 
<BR>
the same statute. The provisions of this title shall also be construed in 
<BR>
pari materia with the provisions of Title 47 RCW, and with other laws 
<BR>
relating to highways, roads, streets, bridges, ferries and vehicles. This 
<BR>
section shall not operate retroactively.
