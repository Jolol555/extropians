<EM>&gt; OK! well thats quite a big subject.  I'll give an overview and then we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discuss various other issues in future posts.  Believe it or not, in one
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; my previous lives I was a Certified Personal Trainer for three years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (through ACE and NASM).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ME:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5'10&quot;/1.77m, 165 lbs/75 Kg, 8% bodyfat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 20-30min cardio training 5days/week
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 30-45 min weight training 5days/week
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Full vitamin supplementation:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Great Earth brand:Multi-vitamin,mineral, anti-oxidant, C (3000mg)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The only ones I take alot of (relative to me) is C, about 3-4g, and E,
</EM><BR>
about
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 1000IU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Right now  I'm investigating replacing some C with OPC (the effective
</EM><BR>
stuff
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in grape seed extract)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 50mg DHEA - My DHEA level was low. This is a whole thread unto itself, I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sure.  I had to go to a special &quot;Longevity Clinic&quot; to find a doctor who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could comprehend the fact that I was not obviously sick, yet wanted
</EM><BR>
medical
<BR>
<EM>&gt; testing/care.  At 35  (just a few months ago) I had a whole battery of
</EM><BR>
blood
<BR>
<EM>&gt; tests that a &quot;normal&quot; GP doctor wouldnt think to give someone my age.
</EM><BR>
Some
<BR>
<EM>&gt; very surprising results came out of those tests! (more on this in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future)
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you get blood and urine tests on a frequent basis?
<BR>
<P>I suggest everyone on this list get them done at least yearly.  One
<BR>
possibility, if you are very young, is to compare prices for insurance
<BR>
policies, then find a really low cost one that does blood and urine testing
<BR>
and will share results.  This means you pay a lot less than the actual cost
<BR>
of those tests -- unless you can find another means of funding -- and can
<BR>
always drop the policy after.  Repeat the process next year.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Diet: I've always been big on nutrient density and avoiding empty calories
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even before I knew anything about them, just seemed logical to me, I
</EM><BR>
guess.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The work of Walford, and then of Parr, served to really convince me of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couple of basic things. 1. Eat less food than you think you need. 2.
</EM><BR>
Avoid,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; as much as possible, added sugar of any kind in any food.  3.  Eat at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; low end of the glycemic index whenever possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So what do I eat then?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Chicken, turkey, fish, egg whites, cottage cheese
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; LOTS of vegetables
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nuts,fruit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1 glass red wine/day
</EM><BR>
<P>I try to stay away from all animal products.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Things I rarely/never/only eat in very small quantities:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bread, pasta, rice, potatos (high on the glycemic index, keeps insulin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; levels too high)
</EM><BR>
<P>One can substitute things like raw or cut oats, rye, and quinoa for low
<BR>
glycemic fillers in the place of the usual high glycemic ones.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, am I missing anything here people?  I believe this to be a reasonable,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practical, and above all sustainable plan for living long enough to
</EM><BR>
benefit
<BR>
<EM>&gt; from the coming revolution in genetic therapy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like a plan to me.  I wish you the best with it.
