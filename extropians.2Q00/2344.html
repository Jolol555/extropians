<EM>&gt;     Yes, last fall I got two tickets because the police checked my license
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plate number and found me on a list of people that had no liability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insurance.  They came very close together.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Twice the Judges sat there with the evidence before them and tried to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; angle me into admitting guilt even though there was no prosecuting evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against me.  &quot;No your Honor, I have received no other tickets.&quot;  &quot;No, your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Honor there are no dents or scrapes on my car.  It hasn't even been washed.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Oh yes, in this jurisdiction driving without libility insurance carries a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hefty fine.
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the things I really love about New Hampshire: If you haven't had an
<BR>
accident or been nailed for DWI, you don't have to have insurance. BTW: On the
<BR>
rare occasions I've been nailed on similar offenses in other states, I have
<BR>
gotten off by going to the prosecutor before the court date and showing him my
<BR>
insurance card and policy. Prosecutors hate losing cases, and will drop the
<BR>
charges given such evidence usually, in order to keep their convection rates up,
<BR>
and if you talk to them ahead of time, they won't get competetive about it
<BR>
either. Being in transit from one state, to another, and passing through a
<BR>
mandated liability state also helps get off, since it can be argued that such
<BR>
mandates on out of staters in transit is a prior restraint on one's right of free
<BR>
transit, and your ignorance of their law is also a mitigating circumstance, which
<BR>
also helps earn a dismissal...
