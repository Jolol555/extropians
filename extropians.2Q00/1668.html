<EM>&gt; &gt;Tell me, if cheap and easy nuclear fusion magically became possible

<EM>&gt; &gt;today, and within a few months most everybody had a fusion plant in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;their back yard, what do you think would happen to the economy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Power would become cheap and lots of people (power co. employees) would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably become unemployed.  What has that to do with health or happiness?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
For the power company employees, lots: they'll have less money, they're
<BR>
certainly not going to be happy (the majority who are compliant with
<BR>
the dominant live-to-work meme, that is), and unhappy/poor people have
<BR>
worse health.
<BR>
<P>Moreover, there's the sector of the economy that serviced their
<BR>
occupation- specific lifestyles (I dunno; fabricating and selling overalls
<BR>
and hard-hats?).  They're going to be unhappy, too.
<BR>
<P>Shutting down an obsolescent industry has health/happiness implications
<BR>
for a lot of people. Doesn't mean it isn't in the best interests of
<BR>
society as a whole -- the direct effects are short-term, or at worst
<BR>
last for a generation -- but in the short term it's something to be wary
<BR>
about. (That's one of the reasons Margaret Thatcher is widely hated
<BR>
in the UK. That something needed doing about the state-run industries
<BR>
isn't a bone of contention today; but the action she took was so brutal,
<BR>
and affected so many people directly, that it's had lasting effects on
<BR>
the whole of British society, effects that are still felt two decades 
<BR>
later. Bad effects.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about if nanotech became magically possible today? I'll tell you: the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;economy would go into a major depression for a good 3-10 years. You are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;talking about making obsolete a whole economy almost overnight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not even.  The economy would undergo a radical shift, but that is not the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same as a depresssion.  OK, so lots of people in the business of making 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things lose their jobs.  So what?  As long as you buy your near anything box 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before you get laid off, who needs a job?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The trouble is, you assume people would buy their near-anything boxen before
<BR>
being laid off. You also assume &quot;who needs a job?&quot;  As Luther said, &quot;the
<BR>
Devil makes work for idle hands&quot;. There's a dominant social meme, which at
<BR>
our current level of technological development we need, to the effect that
<BR>
work is _good_ for you. (I don't want to call it the protestant work ethic,
<BR>
because it isn't protestant-only; it's ubiquitous.) The corollary is 
<BR>
subliminally accepted; there's something wrong with people who _don't_ work,
<BR>
even if the reason they're not working is that their skills have been rendered
<BR>
obsolete overnight and they're not smart/flexible enough to re-train in
<BR>
anything that's still useful. 
<BR>
<P>The result of a move to a high-unemployment post-nano society is going to be
<BR>
a massive surge in social disorder, mental illness, and any number of other
<BR>
undesirable things -- unless we do something to mop up the labour pool of
<BR>
un-retrainables by giving them something to do that makes them feel needed.
<BR>
And I figure nanotech near-anything boxes are likely to show up a bit before
<BR>
intelligence augmentation techniques, and be much more socially acceptable,
<BR>
so we can't simply turn our unretrainables into retrainable geniuses.
