<EM>&gt; You're missing the point. I'll be generous, I'll give you infinite sequences with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no argument, it won't help you a bit, you still won't be able to make boxes as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have described.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You can't just conjure up 4 boxes unless you spell out exactly how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they're entangled. In my original specifications I said things like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;If one box is set at X then the other box [...]&quot;, if there are only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2 boxes then the meaning is clear, if there are 4 boxes then it is not clear.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not saying 4 boxes could not be entangled, but the rules describing their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behavior would be much more complicated and I doubt it would bring much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clarity to the experiment.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was positing that each of the 4 boxes was entangled with each other
<BR>
box in the same way that each of the original two boxes were entangled
<BR>
with each other.  But, if we assume infinite sequences (or sequences
<BR>
based on variables that are unknowable to any external observer, and
<BR>
thus might as well be random for all intents and purposes) and keep the
<BR>
algorithm limited to two boxes (which makes sense - we can entangle two
<BR>
photons with each other, but can we entangle more than two with each
<BR>
other all at once?), I can make the boxes like so:
<BR>
<P>Take six sequences, N1 through N6, all infinite length and random.
<BR>
These are the &quot;master sequences&quot; that box A will use at each of its six
<BR>
possible settings.  (Or maybe just one master sequence - since they are
<BR>
random, and each box A/box B pair has a unique sequence set shared by no
<BR>
other such pair of boxes, who can tell if a sequence changes?)  Box B
<BR>
generates its sequence as follows:
<BR>
<P>* If A and B are set the same, B uses whatever sequence A uses.
<BR>
* If A and B are set 30 degrees apart, B uses A's sequence, with 1 in 4
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;beats altered.
<BR>
* If A and B are set 180 degrees apart, B's sequence is the inverse of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A's.
<BR>
* If A and B are set 120 degrees apart, something else happens (exactly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;what doesn't matter to meet the needs of the experiment; it could be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2/3rds difference or just use whatever sequence A would have used with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that setting).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes but it's not my logic, I don't pretend to understand why things work that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way, as Richard Feynman said, nobody understands quantum mechanics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However the universe doesn't care if I think any of this makes sense or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not because that's the way things do work, there is absolutely no doubt,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and all you need is a filter that moves in 30 degree increments.
</EM><BR>
<P>Granted.  But the universe can't contradict itself.  Nobody *currently*
<BR>
understands QM fully - but that does not necessarily mean that QM can
<BR>
not eventually be made sense of (it could be, it could be not; the only
<BR>
way to know for sure is if it can and once we have).  I'm just tossing
<BR>
in my shot in the dark, on the off chance that it can help.
