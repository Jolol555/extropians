Bonnie (&quot;altamira&quot;) noted in passing that Jared Diamond said:
<BR>
<P>&quot;... murder is a far more common cause of death among tribal people
<BR>
than among civilized people.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Other anthropologists have remarked on this also. I recall reading somewhere
<BR>
about one scientist who was interviewing members of a remote tribe
<BR>
concerning the frequency of homicide. He mentioned that in his country (the
<BR>
USA) criminals sometimes killed people while robbing them or for other
<BR>
reasons. The tribal members were horrified; they said that such a thing
<BR>
never happened in their group.
<BR>
<P>But when the anthropologist asked them about witchcraft, the tribal folks
<BR>
said that witchcraft was a major problem. They had had to kill several
<BR>
witches in just the past year or so. When he asked them for precise names
<BR>
and numbers, and then calculated the &quot;witchcraft execution rate,&quot; he found
<BR>
it to be far higher than the murder rate in the most violent US inner city
<BR>
neighborhoods.
