Hello Extropes,
<BR>
<P>On the front page of my Int'l Herald Tribune this morning was an
<BR>
article titled: &quot;European Space Agency Boldly Goes to Sci-Fi Fans for
<BR>
New Ideas&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Now as part of Europe's bid for a technological lead, the European
<BR>
Space Agency, is asking the public to submit ideas from scienc-fiction
<BR>
novels that might warrant a fresh look in light of advances in
<BR>
technology and materials.
<BR>
<P>It takes an average 60 scientific flashes of brilliance to produce one
<BR>
that is usable, and the agency is casting the net wide for new ideas.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From that article, go to
</EM><BR>
<A HREF="http://itsf.spaceart.net/">http://itsf.spaceart.net/</A> and click on &quot;Information&quot;.
<BR>
<P>You will find these paragraphs
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&quot;How you can contribute (and why you should)&quot;
<BR>
<P>Some people tend to see Science Fiction as pure imagination with no
<BR>
serious scientific background.
<BR>
<P>The ITSF study is an opportunity to see not only if SF does indeed
<BR>
express ideas that are ahead of their time (in the field of space
<BR>
technologies), but also whether they could actually be developed. It
<BR>
is an in-depth look beyond the actual borders of science and
<BR>
techniques, and it deals with exciting concepts that might be explored
<BR>
in the next decades. This project could also contribute to some of
<BR>
these ideas being further studied by ESA engineers in the near future.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
For SF fans, the ITSF study should be a stimulating perspective, as it
<BR>
will create an unique review of imaginative ideas related to space
<BR>
technologies found in the SF domain. It might even give ideas to
<BR>
authors and affect new trends in Science Fiction...
<BR>
<P>Therefore, if you are interested in technology, new concepts, space or
<BR>
Science Fiction (literature, films or art), you are welcome to join
<BR>
the ITSF E-mail Discussion Forum: comments and explanations regarding
<BR>
the Fact Sheets or evaluation of technologies will be discussed there,
<BR>
as well the study itself and how it is (or should be) conducted. You
<BR>
can also use the Fact Sheet Submission Form if you have in mind any
<BR>
technology that hasn't been listed yet and that you think is worth
<BR>
considering (please refer to the &quot;Fact Sheet help menu&quot; to guide you
<BR>
in filling the form). Also, if you are aware of any resources on the
<BR>
Internet that may be relevant to this study, you are invited to add
<BR>
them to the ITSF Resources list.&quot;
