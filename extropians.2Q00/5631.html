In a message dated 6/20/00 10:22:10 AM Pacific Daylight Time, Martin Ling (?) 
<BR>
writes:&lt;&lt; &gt;...I'd rather be enslaved, a situation in which I am alive and 
<BR>
have a
<BR>
&nbsp;chance of escaping or being freed, than 'give the finger' and be 
<BR>
annihilated.  &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some one made a comment about the American Indian following the route of 
<BR>
the one finger salute.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their conduct might be understood that way but I believe generally the 
<BR>
Indian has to be understood in the light of their situation.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is believed by some that originally there were as many as fifty 
<BR>
million Americans spread from the North Pole to the South Pole.  It is said 
<BR>
that ninety percent of that population died; the majority died of disease not 
<BR>
violence; and they often died before the white man was even on the local 
<BR>
scene.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the white man arrived he made treaties and broke them, the Americans 
<BR>
kept dying of disease and sometimes violence, the white man ruined the 
<BR>
hunting and blocked the Americans off their hunting grounds in other cases.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying to paint a picture of the red man coming to realize that if 
<BR>
he fought he would die and if he didn't fight he would die.  If he went on 
<BR>
the reservation he would starve.  Finally he fought.  His chances of winning 
<BR>
were very poor but better than the alternative.
