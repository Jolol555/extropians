<EM>&gt; Speaking of hydrogen, yesterday I was talking to a guy in the Moffett
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blimp hangar with a hydrogen balloon.  He had a small H2 cylinder.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asked him if someone breathed hydrogen would it make one's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voice sound funny like helium does?  He didnt know, but since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the reason helium highes ones voice is because its density is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; low, seems like hydrogen would high it even more.  But we didnt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know if it would goof one to breathe hydrogen.  We couldnt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think of any reason why it would, but no one volunteered to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; breathe the stuff.  {8^D

<P><P>DO NOT BREATHE HYDROGEN. IF IGNITED IN YOUR LUNGS IT CAN KILL YOU.
<BR>
<P>Since the flammable limits in air are 4% to 74%, and mixing would vary
<BR>
from 100% air in the tidal volume to 100% H2 in the last of the
<BR>
inspiration, all it would take would be one small spark.  The
<BR>
overpressure would instantly burst your lungs, giving a fatal air
<BR>
embolism.  Ugly way to die.
<BR>
<P>Cyclopropane is sometimes used as an inhalation anesthetic, but its
<BR>
explosive limits in air are only 2.4 to 10.4 percent- and the
<BR>
anti-ignition precautions in that application are draconian. 
<BR>
<P>That said, hydrogen's solubility is like that of helium, and it is
<BR>
sometimes used in deep-sea breathing mixtures because it actually has a
<BR>
slight narcotic effect. This is used to reduce the high pressure nervous
<BR>
syndrome of parkinson's-like tremors caused by helium at depths beond
<BR>
800 FSW.  At sea level, hydrogen is physiologically inert.
