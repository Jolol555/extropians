<P><EM>&gt;Sure. How about we refrain from arguing about whether Windows is good or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bad, or even whether MS is nice or not, and stick with the question of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whether the government can do something to make things better by intervening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the market?
</EM><BR>
<P>That sounds very reasonable to me. 
<BR>
<P>The basic problem that I see is that there is no real competition in
<BR>
the i86 operating system market. Let's ignore how that situation came
<BR>
to be - I have nothing against Microsoft persay, I'm not interested in
<BR>
punitive damages - and talk about whether it's a bad thing and whether
<BR>
government intervention can do something constructive about it.
<BR>
<P>Now, obviously I think monopolization is a bad thing - so you can
<BR>
insert all those standard arguments here. What it really comes down
<BR>
to, I think, is that control of the PC platform is too important to
<BR>
trust to a single corporation: there's too much potential for abuse
<BR>
and we loose the advantages of distributed economic optimization. This
<BR>
is an abstract compliant, not one specific to Microsoft. Perhaps you
<BR>
don't object to monopolization as strongly as I do, either because you
<BR>
think it's unstable or because it's a lesser evil than government
<BR>
interference. 
<BR>
<P>There will never, without government intervention, be an
<BR>
implementation of Windows offered by anyone other than Microsoft. The
<BR>
API is too big and the target is moving too fast. Consider the
<BR>
failings of Win-OS/2, and the Wine project. Even putting aside
<BR>
copyright issues, the propriety kernel ABI for instance, binary
<BR>
compatibility with Windows is a pipe dream. The only way to compete is
<BR>
to create something new - and here the barrier to entry is
<BR>
applications support. I'm not making any value judgments here - I'd
<BR>
object as strongly if OS/2 had dominated the market or if, one day,
<BR>
Linux is in a similar position and turns to the dark side. It seems to
<BR>
me that the OS market, by it's very nature, tends towards
<BR>
monopolization. The resolution I see is insistence on public
<BR>
standards.
<BR>
<P>So, then, what is are appropriate remedies? I'd like to see, as I've
<BR>
suggested before, a prohibition against government itself purchasing
<BR>
software based on non-open standards. This minimally interferes with
<BR>
the market - it doesn't place any restriction on what you can write,
<BR>
buy or sell, and it doesn't specify what those standards might be or
<BR>
how they are developed and controlled. It doesn't target Microsoft
<BR>
specifically, it applies to all vendors and doesn't cripple one
<BR>
competitor while artificially rewarding others. It doesn't place any
<BR>
restrictions on what private parties are allowed to do. Microsoft
<BR>
would be free to choose whether it opens it's specification and
<BR>
provides the source for a reference implementation, develop a separate
<BR>
product to sell to government, or opt out of that particular market.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to see a market where I don't buy an 'operating system,' I
<BR>
buy a memory manager, a tasking subsystem, a file system, a desktop
<BR>
environment, etc, from independent vendors - and they all work
<BR>
together because they all conform to open standards; in the same way I
<BR>
can purchase a nut and a bolt from two different manufactures because
<BR>
they come in standard sizes. I go down a check list getting the pieces
<BR>
that best suit my needs and my budget, or I just buy the whole thing
<BR>
from a system integrater. Now, I don't really think that this is
<BR>
possible in practice, at least in a pure form, but it's the sort of
<BR>
thing I'd like to see us strive towards.
