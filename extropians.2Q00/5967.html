<P><EM>&gt; Sure, but you shouldn't hand them their weapons, should you? It is one

<EM>&gt; thing if they have to deliberately misrepresent us (and that can be

<EM>&gt; exposed, scoring debate points), another to have to face some idiocy

<EM>&gt; some transhumanist said on a public list...

<P>Anders, I dont see this as an issue, since any person could have
<BR>
figured out a way to insert material in the archives with any name
<BR>
on it, and placed a false early date on it.  For this reason, no one should
<BR>
ever need to answer for anything they allegedly posted to the list.
<BR>
<P>If in some future debate, someone calls you on something you posted,
<BR>
why not point out that you may or may not have posted that particular
<BR>
item?  Unless you put a digital signature on it, everything from Eliezer's
<BR>
anti-purple-dinosaur posts to my originally-incorrect calculation of
<BR>
Jeff Davis' planet cooling orbit analysis has total plausible deniability.
<BR>
Furthermore, I have intentionally had extropians who were guests in
<BR>
my home post stuff under my name.  Everyone who ever posted
<BR>
anything that now embarrasses you: it never happened.
<BR>
<P>That being said, imagine the greens attitude towards Mars colonization.
<BR>
It will be a loooong time before that place is filled with humans.  In the
<BR>
mean time, during the terraforming process, it would make a truly
<BR>
wonderful unspoiled and unraped wildlife refuge, would it not?  spike
