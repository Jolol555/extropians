From: &quot;Emlyn (pentacle)&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:pentacle@enternet.com.au?Subject=Re:%20Didn't%20need%20no%20welfare%20state&In-Reply-To=&lt;200004191426.HAA27984@well.com&gt;">pentacle@enternet.com.au</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Yet individuals will do this. This is the difference between the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;formal social rules and the real social rules.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For many people in circumstances of very low social buy in, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;local optimum action will be criminal behaviour.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The only reason that they should not pursue such action is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;externally imposed set of rules/moral values, by the powerful upon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the powerless. Big nasty govt?
</EM><BR>
<P>Those who opt for crime, will be incarcerated.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;They may not have the formal right, but they have the power. See
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;above.
</EM><BR>
<P>You may see above.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt;&gt; You can start by asking them, or you can insist upon an answer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;if they are caught in an illegal activity. You may help them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;yourself or refer them to social services.
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I would content that the same answers would come from people in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;either camp, if in fact the division between &quot;dole bludger&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;down on luck&quot; types actually represents reality, which I suspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it does not.
</EM><BR>
<P>Either way it doesn't matter. Help them if YOU chose, refer them to
<BR>
social service if you don't.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I agree that rights and duties must coexist. Power &amp;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;responsibility must travel in pairs. The problem is, being self
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supporting  means being self supporting all the time. If all of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were to be left to starve the first time we became non-self
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supporting, not too many of us would be reaching old age!
</EM><BR>
<P>Smart people will invest to cover these possibilities. Paying your
<BR>
dues by being an active part in a family group is also a good idea.
<BR>
Creating a Govt sinkhole that actually promotes irresponsibility is
<BR>
a bad idea.
<BR>
<P>Note from my previous post, handouts are a bad idea, they corrupt
<BR>
the well off as easily as the poor.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;.... and in time, these children are responsible for the welfare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the society at large as potential workers, and so the welfare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the aged (at least those unable/unwilling to work). Eventually,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these people benefit those who have not participating in paying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their &quot;cost of development&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I will be paying my own way, not relying on the goodwill of future
<BR>
generations.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;This is like saying that those who think roads are necessary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should build them, or those who think education is necessary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should build the institutions. Maybe this is libertarian thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;after all? The market will provide, and all that stuff. Is this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;truly what libertarians are peddling?
</EM><BR>
<P>Those who think roads, schools, and whatever else are necessary
<BR>
should build them, or at least pay to have them built. I am not
<BR>
claiming my position as Libertarian.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt; I don't have any problems with legal immigrants.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Mostly people don't. Are we going to be able to cope with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seriously increasing the number of legal immigrants?
</EM><BR>
<P>If we cannot, then the answer is clearly we should not.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;If all births were planned, we'd be extinct (that's not mine,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;obviously). What would western population demographics look like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if only those who could &quot;afford&quot; kids had them? Disastrous! And,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;our countries would be sad places containing only the aging, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kind of mockery of human existence that seems to stem again and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;again from economic rationalist dogma.
</EM><BR>
<P>I never said all births should be planned (although its not a bad
<BR>
idea). Just that those who have children should pay the costs
<BR>
involved.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Umm, too emotive and unsupportable. Sorry about that. Let me try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;again.
</EM><BR>
<P>Go right ahead.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If children are the single most precious resource of all, why are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they primarily the responsibility of parents, when the benefit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems to flow to everyone; that it flows more to the parents than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to other members of society would be a hard premise to support.
</EM><BR>
<P>That it flows to anyone besides the parents is a premise you have
<BR>
yet to successfully support.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;How about this: Many people with the bucks wont have kids because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they are too busy doing whatever it is that earns the bucks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Others have kids without the bucks because, well, what else are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they doing? So really, these second group are not a burden, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are actually providing social benefit, which the first group are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;free riding on.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have yet to prove these children are of benefit to me in any
<BR>
way. I have already pointed out I do not require any of their
<BR>
future earnings to support myself.
<BR>
<P>If I have need of their services in the future, I will pay them at
<BR>
the time of service.
<BR>
<P>Having said this I should point out that I have a number of
<BR>
nieces,nephews and sons and daughters of friends who get support
<BR>
from me in a number of ways and will continue to do so.
<BR>
<P>There is nothing inconsistant about this, I am free to &quot;invest&quot; in
<BR>
whomever I chose. Actually invest is a poor word since I don't
<BR>
expect any returns.....  ;)
