<EM>&gt; I'm quite suspect of private charity being able to make these fine grained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; judgement calls. I could accept that they might be able to only hand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charity to those in need; I am less convinced that all of (or even a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proportion of) those in need will necessarily receive handouts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Interestingly, from close observation of true slackers (not fun, I assure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you), I would even doubt the ability of private charities to seperate the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needy and the slackers. There are a good proportion of professional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charity cases out there, and they get a damned lot of non-govt handouts,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be assured!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wonder whether the truly needy could appear as needy as the professional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slackers have learned to?
</EM><BR>
<P>Let's remember who the 'truly needy' are here. My earlier argument was that
<BR>
those who are physically or mentally incapable of work are the only ones who
<BR>
should receive long-term assistance, and that there is an additional
<BR>
population of 'down-on-my-luck' cases who could use a helping hand for a
<BR>
short period of time. These people are all relatively easy to distinguish
<BR>
form a half-clever freeloader.
<BR>
<P>The short-term assistance cases are a self-limiting issue - if Fred the
<BR>
moocher shows up with a sob story, collects assistance for a few weeks, and
<BR>
shows no interest in ever doing anything about becoming self-sufficient, you
<BR>
can cut him off. He can stretch things out by making the rounds of different
<BR>
charities, but eventually word will get around that he's just freeloading.
<BR>
Unless he is a really talented con man, or he does a lot of traveling, he's
<BR>
going to end up being forced out of the charity system. The incapacity cases
<BR>
present a similar situation. Fred can pretend to be one for awhile, but it
<BR>
is very difficult to fool people about such things for long periods of time.
<BR>
<P>That leads me to expect that a private charity system with sufficient
<BR>
funding would tend to help everyone who actually needs it, plus a small
<BR>
additional population of moochers. The charities themselves will act to keep
<BR>
the moocher population in check, but the psychology of charity workers leads
<BR>
me to believe that they are unlikely to ever become so stringent that they
<BR>
exclude the genuinely needy.
<BR>
<P>There is also another beneficial effect operating here, which is that the
<BR>
population of incapacitated individuals is likely to shrink over time as
<BR>
medical technology improves. At the same time, improvements in diagnostic
<BR>
technology make it more and more difficult for cheaters to fake an illness.
<BR>
We should therefore expect that over time the amount of money the charities
<BR>
have will grow, while the population they need to help actually shrinks.
<BR>
<P>The only real question I see is whether we have reached the point where
<BR>
private contributions to charity would be sufficient to support such a
<BR>
system. I think the answer is yes, but I don't have any way to prove it.
<BR>
OTOH, if you think that is a problem you can always add in indirect
<BR>
government assistance (tax breaks, regulatory exemptions, etc).
