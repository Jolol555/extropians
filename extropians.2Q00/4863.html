<P>
We've had our fun with John Mack of Harvard, who supports the idea of alien
<BR>
abductions.  
<BR>
<P>We've kicked around Courtney Brown of Emory University, who touts remote
<BR>
viewing.
<BR>
<P>Now there's Kevin McDonald of Cal State Long Beach calling Judaism a
<BR>
Darwinian strategy: 
<BR>
<P>&lt; <A HREF="http://www.newtimesla.com/issues/2000-05-25/faultlines.html">http://www.newtimesla.com/issues/2000-05-25/faultlines.html</A> &gt;
<BR>
<P>A few excerpted paragraphs:
<BR>
<P>In his books, MacDonald uses an approach called evolutionary
<BR>
psychology to argue that Judaism is not merely a religion; it is also a
<BR>
Darwinian strategy that serves to raise Jewish IQ, and that
<BR>
anti-Semitism can be understood rationally as a by-product of
<BR>
natural selection. He writes that Jews have reacted to
<BR>
anti-Semitism by taking over intellectual movements and attacking
<BR>
Gentile culture to promote Jewish interests. The result, he warns, is
<BR>
a &quot;present decline of European peoples in the New World.&quot; He also
<BR>
asserts that Jews protect their interests by suppressing criticism of
<BR>
Judaism, and cites David Irving as an example of a writer whose
<BR>
work has been suppressed by Jewish groups. 
<BR>
<P>(...)
<BR>
<P>Now, MacDonald finds himself immersed in intellectual warfare
<BR>
with his colleagues. His critics are careful to point out that they 
<BR>
believe firmly in MacDonald's academic freedom, and don't 
<BR>
question his right to research what he wants and to continue 
<BR>
teaching at the university. But, says [History Department Chair] 
<BR>
Sievers, professors are determined to make MacDonald answer 
<BR>
for the implications of his theories. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Faculty can make him uncomfortable. And I think we've made him
<BR>
very uncomfortable. And we're not done yet,&quot; she says. 
<BR>
<P>History professor Don Schwartz has been one of the most vocal.
<BR>
&quot;Academic freedom protects the kind of research that MacDonald
<BR>
is doing. But he's been asked to explain and defend his ideas, and
<BR>
that's a perfectly reasonable expectation,&quot; he says. No one,
<BR>
Schwartz says, is calling for some kind of action that would result in
<BR>
MacDonald's censure or expulsion. 
<BR>
<P>MacDonald complains that asking him to present his views publicly
<BR>
is not an appropriate thing to ask a tenured professor to do. His
<BR>
theories are too complicated, he argues, for him to present them
<BR>
orally to an audience that is likely to be hostile. 
<BR>
<P>(...)
<BR>
<P>Others, Fiebert says, complained that MacDonald's books had
<BR>
already passed peer review, and so it was inappropriate to subject
<BR>
them to further inquiry. 
<BR>
<P>(...)
<BR>
<P>Here's what Culture of Critique predicts, after MacDonald has spent
<BR>
nearly 1,000 pages in his trilogy describing the Jewish &quot;evolutionary 
<BR>
strategy,&quot;  which includes denigrating Gentile culture through
<BR>
Jewish-dominated intellectual movements: 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I believe that in the United States we are presently heading down
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a volatile path -- a path that leads to ethnic warfare and to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development of collectivist, authoritarian, and racialist enclaves.&quot; 
<BR>
<P><P><P>I was especially taken with the ideas that it's 'inappropriate' to ask a
<BR>
tenured professor to publicly explain and defend his views, and to subject
<BR>
peer-reviewed books to further scrutiny.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>The origin of all science is the desire to know causes, and 
<BR>
the origin of all false science and imposture is the desire to 
<BR>
accept false causes rather than none; or, which is the same 
<BR>
thing, in the unwillingness to acknowledge our own ignorance.
