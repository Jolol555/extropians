<EM>&gt; &gt; Only in a debate where the parties have no interest in the outcome. When
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you are betting your life, you sure as hell want to know if the people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mean what they say, or only mean it to apply to other people, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; themselves. One indicates a potential altruist who walks the walk that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their talk describes, the other indicates a closet totalitarian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Allowing totalitarians to hide behind the rules of debate is what has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; caused the worst crimes against humanity to occur.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I completely disagree.  The rules of debate exist exactly to prevent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kind of personal attacks which you are supporting here.  I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe that you are claiming that attacking the personal character of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your opponent is a better approach than thoughtfully debating his ideas.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am curious, though.  If you did want to defend this position,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't your most consistent strategy now be to attack my character
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and reputation?
</EM><BR>
<P>You have not previously crossed the Rubicon. Mr. Powers has repeatedly
<BR>
in the past used the same strategies against myself and anyone who
<BR>
shares my opinions with respect to several issues. According to him, I
<BR>
am an ignorant simple minded rude reactionary yokel who belongs on the
<BR>
Rush Limbaugh show or at a Klan rally (this being a contatenation of a
<BR>
number of prior comments). He refuses to consider counterarguments as
<BR>
rational or reasonable. Despite being demonstrated that his ideas are
<BR>
the worst sort of tyranny, he continues to insist that he's all
<BR>
sweetness and light, that we can trust him (when he isn't even willing
<BR>
to walk is own walk) to look out for our best interests, etc.
<BR>
<P>When people say &quot;there is no hidden agenda&quot; is exactly when I need to
<BR>
start looking over my shoulder. Such people are not to be trusted to
<BR>
live by the same rules you and I do.
