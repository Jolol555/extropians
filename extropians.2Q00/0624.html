<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; All real power is based in force or the threat of force,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No, it isn't. Those who try to ignore the objective reality of natural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;law have to use force to fight against that objective reality.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know what you're talking about here - what's a natural law in
<BR>
this context? And anyway, so what if there are some? Maybe universal emergent
<BR>
principles. Who says we shouldn't fight against them? Gravity's an objective
<BR>
reality, that doesn't make airplanes impossible or useless.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I like the idea of collaborative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; anarchy - it would be great if we were all equals and we could mediate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; all our differences from bargaining positions of equal strength, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; don't believe it works. No one stays equal - you get kings,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; syndicates, warring city states - you get power which is unaccountable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to the people living under it. And that power preserves and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; strengthens itself and wipes out threats to it's survival.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So as I've said, people who think like you buy the precept of &quot;People
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are no damn good and need to be kept penned up for their 'own good'.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>No. As long as you're not hurting anyone else, do what you want. Buy
<BR>
all the guns you want - whatever totem it takes to ward of the black
<BR>
helicopters - so long as you don't shoot anyone it's none of my
<BR>
business. What I do think is necessary though are mechanisms to
<BR>
prevent abuse of power, be that physical power, economic power, or
<BR>
whatever.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You don't understand your own system. Your system is structured to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maximize the possible bribes that dumb middle class and wealthy people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have to pay to cops, prosecutors, and mayors in order to get off or get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;light sentences when they break the law. Since there are SO many laws in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;NY, the average person can easily be found to be in violation of any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;number of laws without knowing it, and that makes the average person on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the street and easy victim for a police shakedown.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that there's a disturbing authoritarian trend, but the
<BR>
solution is better government - not anarchy. I think you're being
<BR>
disproportionately paranoid. They'll be a counter swing. Giuliani is
<BR>
an example here - he swept in on a law and order platform, and now
<BR>
public outrage over police brutality looks like it might nix his
<BR>
senate run. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; And I'm fairly irked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; by paying $5 for a $1 pack of cigarettes because our leaders, in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; great and abiding wisdom, have decided smoking is bad for me and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; ought to be dissuaded or punished for a character flaw.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You aren't being punished, you are paying for the 'cost to society' that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your bad habit imposes, both environmentally and on the social welfare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;health care system, don't you KNOW that??? C'mon, you're a loyal New
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yorker, thats why you people are suing gun manufacturers too....
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm particularly loyal - having just sent of my taxes today, in fact I'm
<BR>
feeling even less loyal than usual.
<BR>
<P>The rationale behind the latest hike was to discourage under age
<BR>
smoking, on the theory kids have less money to set fire to than
<BR>
adults. The public health establishment views drinking, drug use,
<BR>
smoking, etc. as diseases to be eradicated, polio style, by public
<BR>
policy. Social cost is just a useful argument. If the prohibitionists
<BR>
gave more than lip service to social cost they'd take one look at the
<BR>
price of drug enforcement and prisons, not to mention the crime
<BR>
generated by a blackmarket economy and artificial inflated prices,
<BR>
then give up.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Business has no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; such restrictions - it's only charter is to maximize it's stock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; holders value and the only constraints on how it does that are those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; imposed by power from above. Without federal power to protect them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the principles of our democracy are bullshit. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bullshit yourself. The principles of our democracy have gotten run over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;roughshod by the federal government for the last 3/4 century.
</EM><BR>
<P>We've had unprecedented advances in rights for women and minorities,
<BR>
social welfare, working conditions, and the largest economy in the
<BR>
world. Let rampant roughshod running reign. But you've ignored the
<BR>
interesting question: What good is a constitution without a government? What
<BR>
prevents a private police force from searching your house without a warrant or
<BR>
seizing your guns if a fickle market so demands?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I object to the us-versus-them character that discussion of government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; has in so many of these debates. Government is us - it's elected by us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; and made up of us - it's not some alien force, some evil monster out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to crush all that's good and free in the world. I have faith that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; people in government are just like you and me, and most of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; believe in what they're doing and honesty feel they're doing what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; right - even when I disagree with them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Government is not US, its 50.00000001% of us crushing everyone else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thats the central fallacy of democracy. It doesn't represent everyone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just those who voted for whoever is in power.
</EM><BR>
<P>The majority doesn't become any less oppressive because they're voting
<BR>
with their dollars instead of in an election. Why is Microsoft's use
<BR>
of it's market power justified because people buy their product, yet
<BR>
government is oppressive because they do what people elect them to do?
<BR>
Think about the analogy and what it implies for anarcho-capitalism.
