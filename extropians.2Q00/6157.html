<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; I imagine, from the way you have conducted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; yourself here, that you are the sort of person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; who gives thanks every day for the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; duels are no longer legal means of settling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; personal disputes of honor. If you conduct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; yourself in your real interpersonal relations as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; you have here, I would imagine that you would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; not last long in such an environment.

<P>Mike, I am continually amazed at how you turn every conversation into 
<BR>
a discussion about guns.  In the last little bit, you have steered 
<BR>
dozens of threads to the topic of guns.  You must think about them 
<BR>
day and night.
<BR>
<P>When someone asked about &quot;wearable&quot; computers, you responded about 
<BR>
wearable guns.  When someone referred back to Y2K bugs, your referred 
<BR>
back to stashing guns.  When someone asked about claiming the moon, 
<BR>
you responded with the role of guns in the history of land disputes. 
<BR>
When someone compared political systems, you responded about how the 
<BR>
Communists and Nazis banned guns.  When someone complained about bad 
<BR>
statistics, you complained about bad gun statistics.  When someone 
<BR>
pointed out crime statistics, you pointed out gun-control statistics. 
<BR>
When someone described touring Europe, you described gun-control in 
<BR>
Europe.  When someone got into an argument with Max and Natasha, you 
<BR>
explain how guns could solve the problem.  When someone suggested a 
<BR>
&quot;Committee on Un-Extropian Activities,&quot; you mention your tendency to 
<BR>
shoot first and swear the carcass in later.  Why must every 
<BR>
conversation with you turn into a gun discussion?
<BR>
<P>Even if you don't mean to do this, are you aware that this is how it 
<BR>
appears?  Could you at least try to change the subject to include a 
<BR>
prefix of &quot;GUNS:&quot; when you do this?  That way people could filter out 
<BR>
the &quot;GUN:&quot; subjects instead of merely filtering out you.
<BR>
