It is an interesting idea, but couldn't anyone serious about wanting
<BR>
deniability go over to freedom.com or whatever and use their software
<BR>
to setup their own pseudonym? And they could use that nym on other lists
<BR>
too.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I dont know how to deal with deniability of archived posts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; other than to request a complete version of any quoted post
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and a request to confirm my authorship.    spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the early days of the extropians list, there was a policy that archives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were not allowed.  Each person was expected to agree not to store or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; publish any messages from other participants without their permission.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think this was mostly to address the PR problem.  People were afraid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that if they knew their words would come back to haunt them, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would censor themselves and we could not have a fully free intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The early days of the list were heady and exciting.  I don't believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they were quite the &quot;golden age&quot; that some have suggested, but IMO they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were the equal of many of our most productive periods.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From the viewpoint of historical completeness, it is unfortunate that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no publishable record exists of those discussions.  (I would guess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that individuals did keep at least partial archives in violation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the agreement, but they may have been lost by now and may never be made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public.)  But at least it was one way to largely solve the PR problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps some thought could be given to the creation of a more freewheeling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counterpoint to the extropians list, one which required agreement to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no-archive policy.  (I am presently on one mailing list which has such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a policy.)  Then perhaps certain threads could be shunted to that list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if they were getting into unacceptable territory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's another idea, which just popped into my head.  It doesn't help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the &quot;extropians believe X&quot; taunt, but it would prevent individuals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from being linked to their comments in the archives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Imagine a &quot;pseudonymizing&quot; mail list.  Everyone who posts gets their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; name transformed into a pseudonym which is a deterministic but secret
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; function of the email address (for example, the md5sum of a fixed secret
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; string concatenated to the email address).  These are put in as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;From&quot; addresses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The idea is that each person gets a pseudonym, which will be stable over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time as long as their email address remains the same.  People would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get to know the personalities and characteristics of the pseudonyms,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the mailing list would have much the same &quot;feel&quot; as an ordinary list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It might even be that it was easy to make a guess about the real names of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some of the pseudonyms.  The idea is not so much to have high security,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but rather effective deniability.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By putting the work into the mailing list server it makes the list much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easier to use.  You could even make it somewhat fun by using one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; funny-name generators on the web to create the pseudonyms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not a very well thought out idea, but perhaps some will like it -
</EM><BR>
