<BR>
|I took my college girlfriend to a physics seminar featuring Carl Sagan's
<BR>
|Cosmos, because she thought Sagan was the most gorgeous man on
<BR>
|two feet.  That changed both our lives: she soon threw me back
<BR>
|for another guy who looked more like Sagan, and I was led to study
<BR>
|Steven Jay Gould, which led to Douglas Hofstadter's Escher Godel Bach,
<BR>
|which led me to realize that my religion and all religions I know of are
<BR>
|self referential systems, unverifiable.  Changed my major from theology
<BR>
|to engineering.  Atheists make poor ministers.
<BR>
<P>I found that the leaders of the mainstream religion of the Western world
<BR>
used the religion as a means to control the believers, without themselves
<BR>
following the faith they preached, and since I have a basic distrust of
<BR>
authority, I came to to the conclusion that I did not need their religion.
<BR>
<P>The natural sciences, the use of the experimental method, and empirism
<BR>
have replaced the early indoctrination with religion in my case.
<BR>
<P>After extracting various metaprogramming methologies from them, most of
<BR>
religion, alchemy and other magical systems belong on the garbage heap
<BR>
of history.
