<EM>&gt; &gt; BTB: I just noticed they found a truck with 48 bodies in it in England. Will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; those be classified as 'accidental' deaths or is someone actually going to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prosecuted for it? Will they now be passing a ban on trucks due to their role as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tools of mass murder?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 58 bodies. The two survivors are under police guard while the cops
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try to track down the gangsters they believe were running the illegal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immigration ring and thought packing 62 people in an airtight container
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a heat wave was a good idea.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You'll note that the dead were illegal immigrants trying to get into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UK. It's also worth knowing that more people emigrate from the UK every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; year than immigrate. Do I need to make the obvious point about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immigration laws being inhumane and a generally bad idea?
</EM><BR>
<P>So the immigrants agreed to be a) packed into a hermetically sealed compartment
<BR>
with 61 other people, and b) were trying to immigrate to a country that is not
<BR>
known for being attractive to immigrants.
<BR>
<P>Frankly I don't find immigration laws to be inhumane. Why are they a bad idea? I
<BR>
suppose what you actually mean is immigration laws that are made to prevent
<BR>
immigration in general, not just to manage immigration? I don't want to hear sob
<BR>
stories about Mexican immigrants. As discussed a few days ago, the problems of
<BR>
Mexico include a population programmed by the Catholic Church to reproduce. Free
<BR>
immigration is merely the externalization of the bad family planning policies of
<BR>
one society on another society that does responsibly constrain its reproductive
<BR>
urges. Just as polluting industries should have to pay the cost of their
<BR>
pollution, societies that produce excessive numbers of people should pay the
<BR>
costs of those problems themselves, not pawn them off on others.
