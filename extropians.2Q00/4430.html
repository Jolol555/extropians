<EM>&gt;I think you would want portable partitions to absorb sound. The cross-talk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;between different discussion groups was an annoyance at the conference. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you I most enjoyed the informal discussions. Meeting some of the people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;post on this list was very enjoyable also.

I think that recording everything would be a good idea, too.  The great 
<BR>
advantage that a facility like this has is the permanence.  You can go back 
<BR>
to it at your liezure (as if) and rethink an argument or look up a 
<BR>
reference.  You lose that when it's just a verbal exchange realtime.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, I've seen some verbal exchanges that should have been 
<BR>
recorded for all time, like the debate over objectivity between David 
<BR>
Kennison and Michael &quot;Chaunticleer&quot; Green at the First Southern Libertarian 
<BR>
Conference in Atlanta in 1971.  It started as an informal exchange at a 
<BR>
party and ended up lasting literally all night.  Both participants had major 
<BR>
knowledge of the philosophical issues and genius+ level IQs. Both of them 
<BR>
were extremely well versed in science as well and could have taken part in 
<BR>
any of the Extropian discussions you see here now, without dropping a 
<BR>
stitch.  At about 7AM the next morning, Kennison - the objectivist - 
<BR>
triumphally declared &quot;A is A!&quot;, winning the debate.
<BR>
<P>By then, virtually every luminary of the libertarian movement was crowded 
<BR>
into the room, hanging on every syllogism.  If it had been recorded, it 
<BR>
would have been the set piece or paradigm for a whole lot of intellectual 
<BR>
inquiry, and saved a huge amount of time that I saw wasted as lessor 
<BR>
intellects rehashed the same issues over the years, blundering around and 
<BR>
committing every fallacy imaginable.
