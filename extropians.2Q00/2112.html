<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Note that this was a comparison of a generation #1 product with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generation #5 product. And the generation #1 product was in the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ease-of-installation bracket as MacOS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; As a brief point (maybe I'm jumping ahead of Michael here), it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; probably not quite correct to say Corel's is generation #1, being built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; on a good deal of Linux development in general, and specifically being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; derived from Debian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Iffy point. Corel took Debian 'Slink' and turned it into their own distro.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Along the way, they wrote their own installer -- the standard Debian one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is (cough, cough) not exactly user friendliness personified -- and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bolted KDE on top of it. They filed a lot of rough edges off of KDE (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suspect their usability testing experience came in very handy) and bolted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some extras into the distro.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I know - but since all the software it incorporates and builds on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goes back varying periods of time up to at least 16 years, it's very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; iffy to say it's a generation #1 product even if it is the first release
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by that company (it's a *distribution*, remember).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, Windows 1.0... ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I characterise it as a release 1.0 product; the kernel and command line
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stuff certainly isn't, but what everyone's judging Corel by is the quality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of their installer and desktop integration, and _that_ is definitely still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a bit fresh. Although their 1.0 beats SuSE's 6.0 into a cocked hat, IMO ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ew, ew, ew, comparisons of version numbers...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Remember when MS jumped Word from version 2 to version 6, so people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would think it was on a par with WordPerfect's 6.0 release?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Little pet annoyance of mine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, considering that there was a Word 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, and 2.0c, then
<BR>
6.0, while WP went just 2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0, I don't see it the same way
<BR>
you do.
