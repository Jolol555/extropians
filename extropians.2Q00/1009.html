<EM>&gt; For starters, nationalism -- which is inextricably linked with patriotism --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is deeply anti-libertarian. _Any_ ideology that tries to fit people into

<EM>&gt; extreme cases subordinates the individual to the state, is exactly that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Out of control nationalism is strongly linked with patriotism, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perversion of it that I discussed above.  I can see the point of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statement that any ideology that tries to pigeon-hole people is to some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extent anti-extropian.
</EM><BR>
<P>There will always be joiners. One of the reasons Extropianism isn't a huge
<BR>
organization is specifically because of its ethic of not shiving much of a git
<BR>
about group growth and group politics.
<BR>
<P>Joiners will join or follow whatever trips their trigger, be they nation states,
<BR>
city states, sports teams (which probably causes more total chaos in europe than
<BR>
anything else), rock bands, or car or software companies... or operating
<BR>
systems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; you continues:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd also like to note that from a non-American perspective making children
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swear an oath of allegiance in school each day looks positively Orwellian,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I don't see massive military power as being admirable, either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I sure don't consider children taking the oath of allegiance to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'brainwashing!'  There is nothing similar in England? I am surprised.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sad thing is that as a schoolboy in the U.S., I did not have the meaning of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it really explained to me.  I remember my friends and I purposely changing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the words to be 'funny' and making eachother laugh.  But generally I took it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seriously and felt patriotic as I spoke the words.  I would want any future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; child of mine to continue taking the pledge.
</EM><BR>
<P>I consider the pledge of allegiance to be falsely directed. The pledge should be
<BR>
directed toward the Constitution, a copy of which should be in every classroom.
<BR>
I don't see this as a bad thing at all.  Pledging allegiance to a flag, that can
<BR>
mean whatever the government and the media want it to mean, is a rather empty
<BR>
and mindless task.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; you continue:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The national system we've been bequeathed is just a degenerate form
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the monarchical system, with the powers devolved to a national level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is just a replacement for the Crown.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Modern democracies are just a degenerate form of the monarchial system?  For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasons stated above I would have to disagree.  I can see some connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but not the wholesale link you do.  I appreciate having the vast power one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; man used to have as king being spread around with various branches of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government that are limited by checks and balances.  And we can try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; influence or change things without being hung or imprisoned if the king
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really dislikes the idea.
</EM><BR>
<P>Charlie still lives under a system where the head of state IS in fact a monarch,
<BR>
and his system has no written constitution that recognises that all rights
<BR>
originate in the individual, who delegates them to the government. This is the
<BR>
primary difference between the US and every other english speaking country. They
<BR>
all still have the Queen as head of state, the sovereign, or else the Queen
<BR>
delegated her sovereignty to the parliament, the state, so that the citizens of
<BR>
such countries are still the subjects of the government.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I do think I understand your point as being that ultimately, the federal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gov'ts of even democracies still have incredible power over the citizenry,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even if it is generally more fairly used.  And we are expected as citizens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be generally loyal subjects to not a king anymore, but our flag and p.m.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or president.
</EM><BR>
<P>In which I agree with Charlie is totally wrong. The Constitution is the only
<BR>
thing that deserves or gets my loyalty.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I fervently hope that in the first world and especially in the United
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; States, that dialogue and change can be done in productive and peaceful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ways.  Rather then an elimination of the U.S. government, I see changes that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would simply reduce its size and influence, while handing over much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power to the people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<P>Returning it to its former lack of brilliance. Thats the crux of the matter
<BR>
though, youd have to chuck millions of people addicted to government power or
<BR>
government benefits out on their arses to sink or swim. Weaning would be easier,
<BR>
but it takes constant pressure to work the spoiled brat off the teat of the
<BR>
state.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Remember the Falkland Islands?  Now, that was a patriotic scene with all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those Brits waving at the ships loaded down with troops and equipment to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stop those vicious Argentines from trying to control land right off their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shores. ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>Not quite right off their shores. About as far as Iceland is from Greenland.
