<P><EM>&gt; Is there anyone even dealing tangentially, with nanotech in combination
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with cryonics? Is there some precepts of what the nanobots would do to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preserve or regenerate the patient's tissues?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, EoC discusses it in general terms.  Ralph Merkle has done some
<BR>
papers (see www.merkle.com) on the feasibility.  These papers generally
<BR>
make hard core medical people somewhat crazy (partially due to the
<BR>
assumptions and partially due to the knowledge base differences).
<BR>
I think Robert F. is supposed to do some more detailed analysis
<BR>
at some point for subsequent volumes of Nanomedicine.
<BR>
<P>Greg Stock, I believe is doing a presentation at the Alcor Conf. on
<BR>
whether all cryonics revivals will be uploads.  That is a very
<BR>
dubious assumption because it assumes the understanding of mental
<BR>
information maps (i.e. data encoding in your brain) will come
<BR>
before the nanotech that allows cryonics reanimation (highly
<BR>
questionable IMO, though Anders would be the real expert to ask).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How is this supposed to happen? Any URL's?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ralph's papers are the best that exist right now.  Other than
<BR>
that you would have to query Eric or Robert F. directly for
<BR>
their thoughts.
<BR>
<P>Its kind of interesting when you think about it, that you have
<BR>
dozens or hundreds of people depending on the intuitive beliefs of
<BR>
perhaps 4 individuals (including myself in the &quot;authoritative&quot; group)
<BR>
who have looked at this in enough detail that they claim to
<BR>
understand the problems well enough to say &quot;this will work&quot;.
<BR>
But then again, there are millions of people who believe in
<BR>
the resurection based on a considerably less robust analysis... :-)
