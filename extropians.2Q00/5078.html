<EM>&gt; &gt;  Actually, I thought she was nauseous at the idea that women at GOP get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  togethers could be attractive....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That was part of it. I am glad you caught the humor. ; )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And Mike,  I wasn't offended or anything. I just wondered what the heck you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought slutty male information about GOP women would do for ME, a list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; member. I know if you go to the Beverly Hills Polo Club you'll see good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking republicans - a girl can go look at a rich young man in an Armani
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suit too. But I wouldn't post it on the list so all the Extotopian girls
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could find out and hopefully get laid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My point was: I wondered about your own personal filters, can you filter out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ANY thing, or do you just post all your errant psychological ramblings to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list?
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, I do filter out SOME things. I expect though that most people on the list
<BR>
would know me well enough to tell when I'm being facetious, satirical,
<BR>
sarcastic, or whatever...I do also tend to be an instigator...
<BR>
<P>The main reason I brought it up is cause I see the occasional whine/pine by some
<BR>
guy on the list wondering where all the women are... As for me, I don't care
<BR>
that much, women usually find me, I'm not that interested in the chase. What
<BR>
they find me is another subject entirely...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  You know, I don't go to GOP things anymore. Nah, I much prefer those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Libertarian meetings, full of smelly, sweaty, stubbornly offensive nerds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  yapping Randisms and whining about their capital gains taxes....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the record, that's what is blatantly offensive abotu LDC's comment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's no self awareness. I wonder if he ever looked in a mirror?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are somewhat of a sexist Mike, but of the charming type who is also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chivalrous.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks, I think....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; THANK you Mike, for having the intelligence and awareness to make fun of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself!!!
</EM><BR>
<P>I was making fun of myself???? OK...;)
