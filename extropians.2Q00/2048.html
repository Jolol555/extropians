<EM>&gt; &gt;The issue isn't downloads, its hardcopy, and I'd be very interested in

<EM>&gt; &gt;finding sources of cds for 2-3 dollars. The utility cost of downloading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;100M or more, especially if your local phone usage rates are not capped,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is less than going out and buying the CD.

<EM>&gt; So for you, software isn't free unless the supplier puts it onto some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physical storage medium and brings it to you for no charge?  If that's the

<EM>&gt; case then, for you, there will probably never be STAAFL.

<P>The issue here is linguistic; we'd be better off speaking in French.

<P>In English, we have one word, &quot;free&quot;, that can be used in different
<BR>
contexts; &quot;you can drink as much free beer as you can&quot; versus &quot;you have
<BR>
complete freedom of speech&quot;. The first meaning is, &quot;you do not have to
<BR>
pay for this&quot;. The second is, &quot;nobody may legally stop you from doing
<BR>
this.&quot; Free software, by the OSD and the FSF, adheres to the second
<BR>
definition; whether it also adheres to the first is irrelevant. And the
<BR>
fact that free software is software liberty is one that the press tend
<BR>
to get confused over -- never mind the business community (who don't
<BR>
generally think in terms of civil rights), and the public.
