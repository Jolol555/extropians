<EM>&gt; &gt; One problem here is that it is hard to determine who to target as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perpetrator of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; these kinds of erosions of freedom.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; For example, in this red-light camera situation, it is obvious that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lockheed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Martin, privately making money off some kind of law enforcement, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhat to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; blame for advancing this violation not only of privacy but of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Consitution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which states quite bluntly that citizens are innocent by default.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How, exactly, is putting up a camera at an intersection a violation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Constitutional rights? The presumption of innocence does not imply that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; State can't watch you to see if you do something illegal - if it did, police
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would not be able to patrol the streets giving out traffic tickets. So long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as the normal standards of evidence are observed in court (i.e. they have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; show that it was you, not just someone with your license plate number), no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rights have been violated.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yet how many people are willing to go through the trouble of making the
<BR>
argument in court, insisting on a trial, etc.? The financial burden put
<BR>
on the accused in lost work time (you have to be at court in the
<BR>
morning, and they take hourse or all day to hear your case) is a heavy
<BR>
incentive to just pay the fine. This is not justice, its extortion.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Likewise, there is no general right to privacy in public places. In practice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such a 'right' would be both nonsensical and coercive, since it would amount
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a demand that no one be able to look at you when you walk down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; street.
</EM><BR>
<P>Observation in person is one thing, automated pattern recognition by a
<BR>
computer and issuance of tickets by computer is another ball of wax
<BR>
entirely. Unless they man every camera with a human being, this is in
<BR>
fact unconstitutional, because it violates your right to confront your
<BR>
accuser. You can't confront a computer, it is not a person.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Anyways, I say this before, it seems quite obvious, any automated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; law-enforcement like a red-light runner camera is a violation of every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; who passes through that intersection's right to presupposed innocence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Constitution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In theory there is no legal difference between automated and non-automated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law enforcement. If a cop can sit at an intersection and watch for traffic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violations (a perfectly reasonable activity), he can put up a camera to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it for him. In practice the automated systems are actually held to a higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standard than human police - if a traffic cop says he saw you break the law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the courts will usually take his word for it, but an automated system has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collect enough evidence to convince the court that there is no reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possibility of error (usually your picture, a picture of your license plate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and an instrument reading showing your violation, all time stamped and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recorded by a tamper-resistant system).
</EM><BR>
<P>Any means of gathering evidence not under immediate human supervision
<BR>
and control is mere hearsay evidence, no matter how accurate or well
<BR>
time stamped it is.
