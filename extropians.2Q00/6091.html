<P><EM>&gt; I've been watching flies alot lately.
</EM><BR>
<P>I loved hearing about your flies, Amara!  I'm still smiling, and yes,
<BR>
Larson's cartoons are great.  My teen aged daughter and I both got a good,
<BR>
healthy laugh at the one with the 2 flies on a date.
<BR>
<P>A person who enjoys watching insects and other small creatures is rich
<BR>
indeed.  I've read that only a small number of insect species has been ID'd
<BR>
and classified.  Almost every day I see a new one I've never seen before,
<BR>
some of them VERY strange looking.  I should start photographing them.
<BR>
<P>There's a spider who's lived behind the clock on my wall for several months
<BR>
now.  I don't know what kind she is, but she doesn't match any of the
<BR>
pictures of extremely poisonous ones, so I keep her around for
<BR>
entertainment.  Rather than one of the beautifully symmetrical webs that
<BR>
some spiders weave, this one's is sloppy and haphazard in appearance, and
<BR>
the spider adds a bit on to it every few days. It's beginning to make quite
<BR>
a mess of my wall.  She's shy and hardly ever comes out, so I have to entice
<BR>
her every now and then by catching a small insect and tossing it into her
<BR>
web. When she feels the web vibrating, she peeks out from behind the clock
<BR>
and slowly eases towards the trapped insect.  When she reaches her future
<BR>
meal, she wraps it up into a neat little package--probably she injects some
<BR>
digestive chemicals into its body at this time.  She must come out to have a
<BR>
leisurely feast at night when she's feels safe from my presence, which
<BR>
clearly annoys or frightens her.  The web now has little empty
<BR>
insect-wrappers hanging from it like Christmas tree ornaments.
