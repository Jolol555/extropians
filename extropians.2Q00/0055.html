<P><EM>&gt; I have to confess that I've only been skimming this thread due to the volume,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I think I see that the discussion is being carried out about what might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a straw man, i.e. the notion of truly UNIVERSAL surveillance.  I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help but wonder whether the discussion might be more fruitful if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered more possible scenarios.  For instance, what if a community
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decided that all police officers had to have a &quot;shoulder cam&quot; that recorded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only when that officer was on duty, extending the highway patrol car
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;pull-over&quot; cams that have been in use in new Jersey now for a year or so?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or even less intrusive, that courts were to decide that a search or an arrest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that wasn't recorded was presumptively unconstitutional?  Or that an oral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contract that wasn't recorded was voidable? Could those be bad things?

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         &quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;

<EM>&gt;                                           -- Desmond Morris
</EM><BR>
<P>I would say it would be a good idea for those that carry guns for government
<BR>
carry recording devices that were both required to be on when on duty, and that
<BR>
that data would be just as recorded evidence is now in terms of evidence for
<BR>
court proceedings, as well as protecting police officers from false accusations
<BR>
of mistreatment as well as citizens from mistreatment.  It would be good as
<BR>
feasible for it to actually be on all the time, and available to prosecution and
<BR>
defense to the extents ruled admissable.  By and large, I would think that
<BR>
untampered on-scene recorded evidence would be admissable, if that is spelled
<BR>
correctly.
<BR>
<P>I don't think we can say that without recording that arrest was unconstitutional
<BR>
in the case of some committed crime, but when it comes to two citizens' words
<BR>
against each other, it shouldn't matter who wears a badge.  Constitutional search
<BR>
requires probable cause which is a gray area which might be more objectively
<BR>
identified in retrospect.
<BR>
<P>One thing this leads to in the long run is jurimetrics and computer aided
<BR>
justice.
<BR>
<P>One issue that I have is that police reserve power for their application, and
<BR>
then some forget that it is only theirs due to the license of the public.  So,
<BR>
that is the case of any situation with people and power, some people would abuse
<BR>
it.  So, we can see ways that would be a) beneficial to the citizens be actually
<BR>
being able to retrieve data recorded of public official's actions, and b)
<BR>
beneficial to the good police by supporting their statements in court.
<BR>
<P>I think these reasons are justification for mandatory on-duty monitoring for
<BR>
police, fire, and emergency personnel.
<BR>
<P>I see little reason if any why having records of all police activity would be
<BR>
negative.  That is not to say I think it should be necessarily public record, but
<BR>
anytime that anyone's justice is at issue where data was recorded by the public
<BR>
safety officer, that data should be available to the concerned parties.
<BR>
<P>I think that static or remote cameras or other recording devices are not
<BR>
generally constitutional and should be subject to wiretap rules.  So, I guess
<BR>
that means I think out with automated red-light and radar traps unless there is
<BR>
actually a police officer there at the intersection.
<BR>
<P>In a similar vein in terms of data production by the government, we see that the
<BR>
White House's e-mail fiasco displays a wanton disregard and contempt by that
<BR>
administration for the American people.  I do not now speak further on that, you
<BR>
can infer my opinion on that.
<BR>
<P>An oral contract is valid except for real estate.  If it goes to court for breach
<BR>
then it is one party's word and supporting evidence against the other, that is
<BR>
why people use written contracts unless they trust the other party, I'm no lawyer
<BR>
so would suggest that no binding arrangement be not written.
<BR>
<P>It is troubling that the subject of this community discussion includes fascism, I
<BR>
would like to change it to &quot;Technological Reform and Liberty&quot; or &quot;The Bright
<BR>
Future of Democracy&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I have begun to write an essay about drug policy, or as it is termed by the
<BR>
government, &quot;drug control policy.&quot;  I think I can prove certain economic
<BR>
realities and how they contradict certain policies.  Anyways, that's something
<BR>
completely different.
<BR>
<P>It takes a lot of monitoring and review to keep government in line, I would
<BR>
think, government is by nature expansionist.  That is not bad in itself, but it
<BR>
is when bad people get power and try to expand the government in malicious or
<BR>
repressive ways that the people should congregate and cast out the offenders.
<BR>
So, it is a continuous process to keep a government democratic and representative
<BR>
of its people and even more so to the highest ideals of liberty and freedoms.
<BR>
<P>Well, thanks for reading. Citizen.
