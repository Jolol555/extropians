<EM>&gt; low that the poor houses became hellish prison camps.  Fortunately, attacks

<EM>&gt;  The failure of the Benthamite poor houses counts as one of the earliest

<P>Thanks for the cite Greg. However, prisoners today are paid about $0.20 per hour,
<BR>
far below minimum wage, and prisons haven't been 'swept away'. Now, this figure
<BR>
does bode ill for the electricity generation scheme. Power costs between $0.05
<BR>
and $0.15/kWh, depending on where you live. The typical bike generator operated
<BR>
by a human can generate something like 200 watts, or 0.2 kW, for an electricity
<BR>
cost (if prisoners are to be compensated for this work) of $1.00 per kWh, far
<BR>
above market rates (not counting amortization costs of the generating equipment).
<BR>
Now, if the purpose of the bikes is to power amenities for the prisoners that
<BR>
require electricity, like TV's, stereos, etc it does put a premium on the value
<BR>
of use of amenities. Of course we pay for the food they need to keep biking, so
<BR>
we pay for it in the end. However the potential for using this technique to make
<BR>
the opportunity cost of using TV's, stereos, and workout equipment much higher
<BR>
than the cost for a prisoner to attend school does have its attractions.
