To me Divinity is what you make of it. Through religion you can become quite 
<BR>
empowered, as well as disempowered. There are many methods and traditions, 
<BR>
each equally valid. Perhaps you are wondering if I &quot;believe&quot; in an outside 
<BR>
God. God is real because He affects me, indirectly through His worshippers 
<BR>
who &quot;believe&quot; in Him. I personally don't acknowlege any kind of objective 
<BR>
reality, but nor do I reject one. Gods are &quot;real&quot; because they affect me, 
<BR>
just as &quot;capitalism&quot; is real, &quot;homosexuality&quot; is real, &quot;mental illness&quot; is 
<BR>
real, etc.

Ronin Cuervo

<P>&quot;His followers called him Mahasamatman and said he was a god. He preferred to 
<BR>
drop the maha and atman however, and called himself Sam. He never claimed to 
<BR>
be a god. But then, he never claimed not to be.&quot; - Lord of Light
