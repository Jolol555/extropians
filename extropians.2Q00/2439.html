<EM>&gt; As I've said before, privacy is a thing of the present, not of the future.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure it will take quite some time for everyone to get on board, but
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; only way to real freedom is mutually assured surveillance.  Anonymity is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worthless to most law abiding citizens.  As fewer legal things become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;taboo&quot; anonymity will be completely worthless, except to criminals.  It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not Orwellian at all.  It's me watching you watching me watching Big
</EM><BR>
Brother
<BR>
<EM>&gt; watching us all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is transparency.  This is the way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -Zero

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Ubiquitous surveilance has its appeal. It is certainly an interesting
<BR>
approach to the problem of &quot;Big Brother&quot;; Big Brother may be watching, but
<BR>
so is everyone else, and Big Brother is as watched as anyone else.
<BR>
<P>However, it does not take account of the (necessary in my opinion) split
<BR>
between the private and public spheres. We all live in cultures where the
<BR>
formal, public culture is different from private, informal culture; we act,
<BR>
feel, and live differently in public than we do in private. This is a
<BR>
psychological effect which has nothing to do with criminal behaviour in
<BR>
private; people just like privacy, for a whole slew of reasons.
<BR>
<P>What I think would be interesting would be some kind of effort for people
<BR>
who wanted ubiquitous serveillance to don wearable cameras, and link up
<BR>
their surveillance systems in real time (likely over the net). This would
<BR>
build a huge database of surveillance information, and would normally be
<BR>
voluntary. Etiquette might dictate that cameras were always easily
<BR>
recognisable on wearers, or indicated prominently, by some kind of
<BR>
international &quot;surveillance&quot; symbol on clothing perhaps, if the equipment
<BR>
chosen is too small to be easily noticed.
<BR>
<P>Such a database would be an excellent base of information for other
<BR>
endeavours. For example, a system might be devised which could take all the
<BR>
most recent info from the database, and build a realtime, 3D, navigable
<BR>
model of the surveyed portions of the world; detailed information rich maps
<BR>
and their hi-tech equivalents could be produced from this database of
<BR>
surveillance (note this likely requires images to be combined with GPS
<BR>
info).
<BR>
<P>Another interesting possibility is for others to tap into the surveillance
<BR>
participant's video and perhaps audio feed, and experience what the wearer
<BR>
is experiencing. This could be connected to a royalty-based system of
<BR>
payments, and produce a direct way for people to make money from simply
<BR>
leading interesting lives; if it's interesting enough, others will tag along
<BR>
and pay for the privelege. For instance, imagine someone climbing Everest
<BR>
was part of the surveillance network; you would imagine they might attract
<BR>
quite an audience!
<BR>
<P>Steve Mann seems to be heading down these kinds of paths with his WearComp
<BR>
wearables; I assume that Zero is aquainted with his work.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, this whole attempt to disolve the private realm is interesting. For
<BR>
instance, imagine if a potential employer could examine your entire life in
<BR>
minute detail (presumably with the help of some very smart information
<BR>
filtering/collation systems), to decide whether to employ you or not.
<BR>
Eliezer has complained in the past of the fact that there are still very
<BR>
public searchable databases of his participation in various internet forums
<BR>
available now, from when he was 14, and held opinions which he does not hold
<BR>
now. Imagine that problem multiplied out to the level where every single
<BR>
instant of your life was available to all.
<BR>
<P>I've toyed with the idea of going down the constant wearable camera route,
<BR>
publishing the entire feed live on the net. But there are a lot of issues of
<BR>
privacy which need addressing. I'd like to have the, ah, gumption to do it,
<BR>
but for now its still in the &quot;Things to do when I go completely insane&quot;
<BR>
basket.
