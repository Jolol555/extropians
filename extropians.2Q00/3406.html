Just for a moment lets ponder the transporter experiment. Modified so that
<BR>
it is a non destructive transporter.  Meaning &quot;I&quot; step on the transporter
<BR>
pad and bam in two shakes of a tail (or preferably a much smaller
<BR>
measurement of time)an exact duplicate of &quot;me&quot; appears some arbitrary
<BR>
distance away.  This entity has all my memories, facial hair, tattoos,
<BR>
receding hairline, etc.  To that entity the experience is rather like
<BR>
stepping through a door.  Both entitities could even meet and play chess if
<BR>
they wanted.  However, as for &quot;me&quot;, &quot;I&quot; am still here. Now we have two
<BR>
seprate entities. imho if you were to kill either one you would still be a
<BR>
murderer.  For both of us, what matters now is the particular point of view
<BR>
of the particular stream of conciousness that exists as a function of the
<BR>
individual entities existance.  Both of us would avoid a destructive
<BR>
Transport like the plague because we both see that we are in fact seperate
<BR>
entities and that destructive transport would therefore be suicide on the
<BR>
send side.
<BR>
-----------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Why wouldn't the two of you reason like this: If this had been a
<BR>
destructive transporter, one of us would've made it, and the other wouldn't
<BR>
have.  We equally experience a continuity with the self that entered the
<BR>
transporter.  If either of us were to consider using a destructive
<BR>
transporter, he wouldn't know whether he'd be the one to make it, or the
<BR>
one that is terminated.  Since he doesn't have any basis for expecting
<BR>
anything other than an even distribution, he'd expect a 50% chance of his
<BR>
awareness being terminated, and a 50% chance of &quot;walking through a door&quot; to
<BR>
the new location.  UNLESS...transportations involved more duplications and
<BR>
terminations along the way.  Then you really wouldn't want to get in the
<BR>
transporter, especially if the copying/destruction happened in several
<BR>
distinct stages, in which case you'd expect your chances of termination to
<BR>
increase exponentially.  Even though the the guy who comes out at the end
<BR>
will have a 100% chance of having been you, you might have a
<BR>
0.00000000000001% chance of becoming him.

The Beyond outside us is indeed swept away, and the 
<BR>
great undertaking of the Enlightenment complete; 
<BR>
but the Beyond *inside* us has become a new heaven 
<BR>
and calls us to renewed heaven-storming.
