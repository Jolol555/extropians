As I've stated for may years (since my comments in the early
<BR>
'90's on sci.life-extension and bionet.molbio.ageing),
<BR>
DNA damage accumulation *should* be part of aging.
<BR>
I base this entirely on the observation that mutations
<BR>
are known to accumulate and in single cells that get
<BR>
amplified lead to cancer.  We have little idea what the
<BR>
mutations may be in non oncogene/tumor-suppressor genes
<BR>
with the exception of some work done in the HPRT
<BR>
gene (R. Albertini comes to mind) and some work
<BR>
that I believe has been done in blood group genes
<BR>
though the details slip my mind at the moment.
<BR>
<P>At any rate, many may be interested in &quot;The Second Creation:
<BR>
Dolly and the Age of Biological Control&quot;, by Ian Wilmut,
<BR>
Keith Campbell, Colin Tudge (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux).
<BR>
Reviewed in July 2000 Discover, pg 116.  The quote which
<BR>
caught my eye:
<BR>
<P>&quot;For ethical and other reasons, the authors do not condone
<BR>
the most unsettling use of cloning to create human genetic
<BR>
duplicates.  In the authors' experience, clones are 10 times
<BR>
more likely to die in the womb and three times more likely to
<BR>
die after birth.  They are also more likely to have deformities.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Now, so long as the cloning is done in a way to remove the brains,
<BR>
I think the ethical issues are specious, but this *does* raise the
<BR>
point that you may have to do 30 clones to get one good one
<BR>
(if you are interested in whole body transplants).
<BR>
<P>It does however in my mind provide a significant amount of gravity
<BR>
for the DNA Damage theory as being a factor in the aging process.
<BR>
The developmental genes in an adult can accumulate mutations and
<BR>
you will never know it.  But if you try to grow a new adult using
<BR>
those genes with accumulated mutations, then the results detailed
<BR>
above are a likely result.  It also suggests that if DNA mutations
<BR>
are gradually causing deaths in the latent stem cell population
<BR>
in the body, that over time you will have less and less reserve
<BR>
capacity from which to renew yourself.  Only if you can reactivate
<BR>
the program that *expands* the remaining subset of &quot;perfect&quot; stem cells
<BR>
(as probably happens during development) will you be able to
<BR>
revserse this aspect of the aging process.
