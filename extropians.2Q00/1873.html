<EM>&gt; &gt; I bought SuSe on a CD that was part of a linux book, that retailed for

<EM>&gt; &gt; $49.00. I bought it on remainder at a used book store for $15. A used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dual processor server I just bought from a guy for $50 happened to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a Red Hat cd stuck in the drive (and he just moved out to Arizona, oh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; well ;) ), so you could say i got that for free. But I doubt that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people are as cheap as I am. Both are 'previous release' issues, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've likewise seen Windows 3.1 and Win95 disks available for nothing or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; next to nothing in similar venues...Buying the latest release of an OS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is not likely to be gotten for free or next to nothing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes it is. You can always download the latest version of RedHat, SuSE,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mandrake, Debian, Slackware, and all the others I could come up with, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obtain the CD for $2-3.
</EM><BR>
<P>The issue isn't downloads, its hardcopy, and I'd be very interested in
<BR>
finding sources of cds for 2-3 dollars. The utility cost of downloading
<BR>
100M or more, especially if your local phone usage rates are not capped,
<BR>
is less than going out and buying the CD. Knowing cd production costs,
<BR>
they are losing money distributing at that rate. Moreover, the business
<BR>
models of companies like these are focused on making money on tech
<BR>
support. I doubt very much that half of the linux companies will be in
<BR>
business in a year or two.

<EM>&gt; Corel is a rather unusual example (it includes some commercial software,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; namely the personal version of WordPerfect).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and Corel is also coming out with linux versions of all of its
<BR>
applications. It intends to give Microsoft a run for its money through a
<BR>
user freindly version of the linux platform and a full linux product
<BR>
line, so long as they don't run out of money first. Michael Cowpland,
<BR>
CEO fo Corel, seems to be afflicted with the gee-whiz virus, and even
<BR>
though they are short onf cash, went ahead and bought Kai, at the same
<BR>
time that they are finalizing their Borland/Inprise merger. He is doing
<BR>
little to improve existing applications, preferring a strategy of making
<BR>
applications pay for their own improvements. Ventura, for example, is in
<BR>
many ways a superior DTP application to Quark, PageMaker, and
<BR>
FrameMaker, but lacks some features that I consider to be of utmost
<BR>
importance to be truly wonderful (though few other DTP apps offer them
<BR>
either, and in the rare cases they do, they are expensive aftermarket
<BR>
plug-ins from third parties.)
<BR>
<P>If Corel can keep its head out of its ass for another year or two, I
<BR>
think they will be positioned to be the major challenge to Microsoft.
<BR>
NOTE: Michael Cowpland is opposed to breaking up Microsoft.
