<P>&lt;&lt; Be careful about declaring space &quot;terra nullius&quot;. As well as the obvious
<BR>
&nbsp;error, there might be the more time honoured difficulty with that term, that
<BR>
&nbsp;the declared area is not empty at all...

Most of the area of space must be rather vacant of tool using life on a scale 
<BR>
which we are used to imagining in stories and cinema. Otherwise we'd have 
<BR>
evidence of it, Fermi-style. However, rather then say its uninhabited, I am 
<BR>
open to evidence and hope that there is tool users out-there and we can be 
<BR>
chums (to some degree). Maybe when our instruments improve and the room to 
<BR>
improve detection inventions and the room to improve the inventions must 
<BR>
really be  phenomenal, we will see splashes of intelligence all over the 
<BR>
visible universe.  But if its mostly dead, and mostly empty, then it seems 
<BR>
that our descendants to enliven the cosmos with their form, presence, works, 
<BR>
and spirit. Maybe its our duty, our ethics, to speed the plow; as long as 
<BR>
(you have suggested) there's nobody to 'plow under'.
