<EM>&gt; &gt; Then you've also got the sonar nets that girdle the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;US. Anything that is metallic and is below the surface gets tracked when

<EM>&gt; &gt;it comes within a certain range.

<EM>&gt; Actually Mike, the SOSA system to which you refer is a passive system.  It is only able to track things that make noise regardless of the chemical makeup.  Active sonar, where being metal really makes a difference is in itself detectable, due to the fact that it must send out the sound signal (ping) and wait for the reflection.  Now a magnetic detection system, which SOSA is not, would function as described in your above paragraph.

<P>I suppose most people are not aware of the sophistication of the newer
<BR>
systems. The newer systems do function passivly, but while they
<BR>
primarily work off of source transmissions, there are also some
<BR>
'undocumented features': they also 'image' the 3D space of the ocean off
<BR>
of ambient diffuse sound, much as whales do. So they can spot any object
<BR>
of a given minimum sonic cross section. A metallic bouy actually
<BR>
reflects quite well compared to soft animal flesh, which is the normal
<BR>
aquatic mammal target. Many whales echolocation capability is sensitive
<BR>
enough to sonically image an entire ocean off of  one or two calls, and
<BR>
the newest mikes were privately developed specifically for studying
<BR>
whales, but the tech was seized by the Navy at the patent orifice. So
<BR>
unless you grow your bouy out of a meat vat, your bouy is gonna stick
<BR>
out like an 18 wheeler on a Nevada highway patrolmans radar scope...
