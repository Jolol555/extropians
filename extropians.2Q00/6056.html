<EM>&gt;How can any state claim specficly that the right to Guns extends only to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as a armed govmt millitia and not for personal use without violateing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;equal protection act when the Washington state constitution cleary states
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they are for the individual citizen's  personal defense ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am a libertarian myself, but I often find these &quot;gun debates&quot; on extropy 
<BR>
quite pointless. I defend people's right to bear arms, but its important to 
<BR>
point out the philosophical reasons. The right to bear arms is there in a 
<BR>
vacuum, it is part of a greater whole. That is that people are entitled the 
<BR>
right to their lives, freedom and property. That's the context of the right 
<BR>
to bear arms. Then one can point out that banning guns wont be a very long 
<BR>
step from banning nanotechnology, cloning, computers, the right to change 
<BR>
one's body, the right of free speach etc, all rights that I hope that all 
<BR>
transhumanists agree on. If you start banning things the steps to ban 
<BR>
another thing are that big. It is through showing the principles behind the 
<BR>
right to bear arms that I think that most transhumanists will agree on it. 
<BR>
Next time its probably you.
<BR>
<P>Guns are not the most important thing in libertarianism either, they are 
<BR>
tools of defense (maybe for collection too). The need for them would be 
<BR>
superflous in a society where everybody respected the others' rights. Like 
<BR>
Jeff Riggenbach said ironacally &quot;just if we have drugs and guns we could all 
<BR>
live in a dump&quot;, but the libertarian vision is bigger than that- it is a 
<BR>
about a peaceful society (instead of the legalized warfare of the welfare 
<BR>
state)- and in that context it's easy for transhumanism to flourish.
<BR>
<P>So in my opinion- don't stress on guns, stress on the right to property and 
<BR>
the right to freedom, and we will certainly see better results.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Waldemar
