I don't know about &quot;recent&quot; past, but here in Germany (my part, that I know 
<BR>
about) cops don't give out speeding tickets. (They are good at giving 
<BR>
directions :-)) There are cams placed at a number of places, and when you 
<BR>
speed, your picture with your car license license is recorded, and then you 
<BR>
get a bill in the mail some weeks later. Those speeders with foreign license 
<BR>
plates get off scot-free, I believe..
<BR>
(end)

<P>I have a friend who was sent by the U.S. army to Germany and he loved being 
<BR>
transferred back to the states and knowing he could get away with not paying 
<BR>
his many speeding tickets!  He hated all the cameras that were all over.  He 
<BR>
was not happy when the Anchorage legislature experimented with cameras, and 
<BR>
neither was the public, so the project was canned.
