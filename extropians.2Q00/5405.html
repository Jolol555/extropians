</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one cooled to a very low temperature. One press slices the brain into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; several centimeter-thick wafers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Getting through the skull is a minor problem I presume...  Or have
<BR>
you removed the brain and spine???
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How irreprable would the damage be? I imagine that the super-computing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needed to reverse ice-damage would not have such a hard time figuring out 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which half-axon in wafer X matched up with which half-axon in wafer Y, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there would also be some &quot;dragging&quot; I think - ripping a cell apart and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smearing its contents over the blade and rest of the brain, fixing this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would indeed be like making &quot;cows out of hamburger&quot;, but how much of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; factor would it be? Also, are we even going on the correct assumption, that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faster cooling is better?
</EM><BR>
<P>I doubt the cooling rate matters much.  There is still residual brain
<BR>
activity in comatose patients or patients who have been dead for hours.
<BR>
Since the brain is sterile you aren't going to have bacteria consuming
<BR>
anything (as would be the case in the gut).  Since you are out of ATP
<BR>
you can't do any breakdown (or construction) that requires energy.
<BR>
So so long as the non-energy requiring enzymes in compartments like
<BR>
the lysosomes remain in their compartments, not much is going to happen.
<BR>
<P>The only caveat here is whether the accumulation of CO2 in the brain
<BR>
lowers the pH enough to create an acidic enough environment outside
<BR>
the lysosomes to activate the enzymes that haven't been delivered
<BR>
to those organelles yet.  [An area where the people interested
<BR>
in Cryonics should do some further study.]
<BR>
<P>I don't disagree that the razor-blade approach might cool things faster
<BR>
and the computer probably could stick things back together, it seems
<BR>
better however to keep the ultrastructure as intact as possible even
<BR>
at the expense of a lower cooling rate, unless severe extralysosomal
<BR>
degradation is occuring.
<BR>
<P>It isn't the blood(O2/glucose)-loss that damages the brain, its
<BR>
the resupplying of energy resulting in excitotoxicity within the
<BR>
neurons causing them to lose control of ion storage and really
<BR>
make a mess of things (I'm sure Anders could provide a more
<BR>
technical explanation -- there is probably several sites on the
<BR>
net that discuss this as well).  Since brain reanimation will be
<BR>
a carefully controlled process, this is unlikely to occur.  We
<BR>
may have drugs within the next 5-10 years that suppress this
<BR>
situation and in the more distant future nanobots within or around
<BR>
neurons can obviously handle the problems.
