<EM>&gt;From the perspective of someone who has attended 50 or more

similar conferences in the last 10 years, I can say they do

get old.  (For various reasons, primarily related to time
<BR>
constraints I will not be at the Alcor conference.)

<P>I only wish I had your perspective, since you have been to over 50 similar conferences!! lol!  For me, it was a chance at seeing the &quot;real world&quot; the people I had only read about and seen pictures of.  In other words, my first time to Disneyworld. ;)  Later conferences may not be as interesting, or at least this one may have special moments or points brought up in a way that never is again.  Because I failed to attend extro 4 I will never get to meet Sasha.  I just hate missing things and as I said before, doubt I will ever get access to transcripts or videos of the conference.  ARGHH!!!!!!!  
<BR>
<P>I need to get out of Alaska, get a degree, and get a decent job so I can attend these things.  Maybe going just once to a conference would get it out of my system.  I do feel obsessed by the idea.  I have sworn to myself that I will attend the next extro no matter what.  I get the impression they are the most fun of the Foresight, Alcor, etc. type conferences and that the most people come out to them.  I want to meet the people whose posts I read each day.  
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
Fundamentally, one has to separate the desirable stuff from the
<BR>
essential stuff.  With regard to cryonics, that comes down to the
<BR>
simple fact of whether or not you are signed up for suspension.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>An excellent point.  Perhaps I am a touch(or more) obsessive in my thinking which will need to be corrected post-singularity.  I do need to get signed up still for cryonics and plan to do that before the year is out.  I also need to try out deseryl for my depression to be able to handle life.  Man, I am messed up! lol  And my lunchbreak is long overdue and I have a ten minute jog back to work, I'm on my way to getting fired!   
<BR>
<P>I suppose ultimately I am just tired of feeling powerless in doing the things I want to, like attend conferences!  I hope all who attend have a great time.
<BR>
