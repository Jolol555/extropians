<EM>&gt; For about 15 minutes, at age 15, I was convinced I was a communist....
</EM><BR>
<P>I remember when I was, oh, 7 or so, saying something offhand to my
<BR>
mother along the lines of &quot;from each according to his ability, to
<BR>
each according to his needs.&quot;  As I recall I had come up with this
<BR>
whole theory myself.   She said if I wasn't careful people might start
<BR>
calling me Karl Marx.   I had no idea what she was talking about so I
<BR>
looked it up.  After a bit of further reading, that was the end of that!
<BR>
But it made great sense at the time.
