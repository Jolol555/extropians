<P>Indeed. I got a major buzz out of meeting Spike and Shelly Jones, my hosts
<BR>
in Milpitas, Robert Bradbury, who with astounding generosity flew me
<BR>
halfway around the world for the conference, Jeff Davis who scared the shit
<BR>
out of me on the back of his motorbike (I'm easily scared) during a side
<BR>
trip to Berkeley, and extropes at the Foresight event itself - Eli,
<BR>
finally; laughing Greg Burch; Robin Hanson and his smile (who would have
<BR>
guessed?); a bunch of others briefly met. 
<BR>
<P>That said, I was, um, disappointed to find myself for about 10 days within
<BR>
a bull's roar of the Bay area, which I believe is thick with extropians,
<BR>
and the only local extropes who emerged from the woodwork in response to
<BR>
several posted head-ups were the aforementioned Spike (who was stuck with
<BR>
me) and Jeff (a fun guy), plus a very pleasant phonecall from an extrope
<BR>
who couldn't make it to the Foresight schmooze. 
<BR>
<P>Next time we start plumbing our navels for insight into bursts of &gt;H gloom,
<BR>
maybe this sorta thang could be borne in mind.
