<EM>&gt; It seems that your criteria are mainly about avoiding death well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather than living well. While the above are certainly a big plus for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any location, it would hardly be the central issues if I wanted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; move anywhere. My list of criteria would instead center around the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; density of interesting people, information sources and events in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vicinity. &quot;Best&quot; is after all a highly subjective thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>YES!  It seems that so many people want to jump from past to future without
<BR>
savoring the present.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I love where I live, because it's remote enough to be private (I'm 3 miles
<BR>
from the farm to market road over 4-wheel drive type terrain); the
<BR>
prevailing winds bring clean air either off the Gulf of Mexico, the
<BR>
Chihuahuan desert, or the plains; we're within easy driving distance of
<BR>
Austin with its university, concerts, restaurants, museums, etc; close to
<BR>
San Antonio which still retains so many of the cultural influences of Spain,
<BR>
Mexico, and Germany; get Austin metro telephone service; we're at the top of
<BR>
the watershed, so we don't get anyone else's trash running downhill; the
<BR>
land is such that we have a fascinating variety of naturally occurring
<BR>
hybrid plants; the history and pre history of the area are very interesting;
<BR>
the people living around me are mostly of an independent frame of mind and
<BR>
don't believe in meddling with other people's business; my immediate
<BR>
neighbors are all exceptionally nice people; the climate allows me to grow
<BR>
probably 90% of temperate climate plants and, with some protection, many
<BR>
subtropical plants and with my attached greenhouse, tropicals such as citrus
<BR>
with very little heat other than solar; and we're only around 90 miles from
<BR>
the Mexican border (to some people this would seem a disadvantage, but I
<BR>
consider it a plus).
<BR>
<P>I took some photos of my place and put them up on my web site, if anyone
<BR>
would like to see my version of paradise.  One of the photo's is captioned
<BR>
&quot;View from north side of Altamira.&quot;  Altamira is the name of my place.  I
<BR>
named it after that cave in Spain with the prehistoric bison paintings.
