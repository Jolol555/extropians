<P>
<EM>&gt; I see complaints like this on the list continually, surely if as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Transhumanists we wish to be at the bleeding edge we should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accept and try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to accomodate all emerging forms of communication technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd quite like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a voice/video mail list with text summaries to enhance my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extropian learning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience (and see what you all look like). Harking back to 'pure text
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only' seems a little conservative/entropic.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>This isn't about accomodating &quot;emerging forms of communication
<BR>
technology&quot;, rather it is about effectively using the standards of a given
<BR>
communication medium.  For email, that is ASCII text.  Most of the useful
<BR>
content on a mailing list can be successfully communicated using nothing
<BR>
more than text, as it has for a long time.  Depending on how and where I
<BR>
am accessing my email, I may or may not be able to read non-text markup
<BR>
and attachments.  Generally speaking, email that is not text/plain ends
<BR>
up in my trash bin without getting read.
<BR>
<P>I think that you should also realize that the people who use text
<BR>
optimized environments for reading their email are not doing so because
<BR>
they are unsophisticated or technologically backwards.  In fact, these
<BR>
people are typically among the most technically savvy of mail users,
<BR>
choosing to use a text-based mail environment because they find it
<BR>
efficient.  Them thar perty winders email clients offer only one narrow
<BR>
interface for Internet communication, and by no means define the
<BR>
standard by which all others should be judged.  And of course, some people
<BR>
in the world have no choice but to use ASCII text environments for their
<BR>
email access.
<BR>
<P>I personally use UNIX-based environments for virtually everything,
<BR>
including email.  If I want to look at something in a non-text format, I
<BR>
prefer to explicitly fetch that item using my browser or some other
<BR>
appropriate utility.  Even when I was using Eudora on NT, I supported a
<BR>
strict ASCII only email policy.  Just because you can doesn't mean you
<BR>
should.
<BR>
<P>My $0.02,
