&nbsp;------------------ 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;There ARE some good things about the multi-track pattern of
</EM><BR>
the last two 
<BR>
Foresight SA gatherings.  The small groups allow better opportunities
<BR>
for 
<BR>
interaction and insure that there is always something interesting
<BR>
going on 
<BR>
for everyone.&lt;
<BR>
<P>Sorry I missed it this year.  My experience last year was educational.
<BR>
&nbsp;First, I appreciated the challening approach that Foresight
<BR>
set up for the gathering.  I found it visually appealing re:
<BR>
the large board display where ideas and sessions kept &quot;evolving&quot;
<BR>
and attendees could pick and choose how much data they wanted
<BR>
to take in for the weekend, with whom they wanted to learn, and
<BR>
with whom they wanted to nanoschmooze (as Chris says).  
<BR>
<P>Second, I enjoyed designing and leading a session.  From this
<BR>
perspective, the gathering was instructional because I had to
<BR>
deal with (a) how to get people to the session --whether or not
<BR>
my session would be full or if it would be a no show; and (b)
<BR>
how to keep participants focused and interested while much noise
<BR>
and movement was occuring around the session.  
<BR>
<P>Overall for most sessions, periferial factors such as lack of
<BR>
ecostics and physical partisions caused interference but in the
<BR>
overall scheme, they were minor.  The major interference was
<BR>
larger sessions scooping up participants from smaller sessions
<BR>
because of better seating arrangements, voical power, or person
<BR>
power.  In otherwords, I noticed that participants (such as myself_
<BR>
who might change sessions mid-point pending on popularity of
<BR>
session as well as content.  Now, this isn't necessarily a bad
<BR>
thing.  In fact, it creates a fluid and mobile environment (similar
<BR>
to the coctial party vision that Robin mentioned previously).
<BR>
&nbsp;The downside for people (like me) is that I want to know what
<BR>
is happening in other sessions!  
<BR>
<P>Problems occur when there is an imbalance with context and intent.
<BR>
&nbsp;If a conference is designed to function like the leaning Tower
<BR>
of Pisa, it needs to have some stabilazing turf to hold it upright.
<BR>
<P>&lt;I can envision trying to get the best of both kinds of conference.
<BR>
&nbsp;Perhaps a 
<BR>
traditional auditorium for single-speaker/panels with large-group
<BR>
audiences, 
<BR>
coupled with a separate, nearby area in which &quot;nodes&quot; could be
<BR>
set-up for 
<BR>
ad-hoc discussions.  The nodes MIGHT be labeled for use by people
<BR>
interested 
<BR>
in particular subjects.  These node areas would have comfortable
<BR>
chairs, 
<BR>
places to put up posters, whiteboards, etc. 
<BR>
<P>A &quot;conference architecture&quot; might be built around having only
<BR>
two large-group 
<BR>
presentations per day, and the rest of the time could be reserved
<BR>
for ad-hoc 
<BR>
discussions around the &quot;nodes&quot;.&gt;
<BR>
<P>This similar to the architecture Max is working on and Extro
<BR>
5 will be different than the conferences we have had in the past.
<BR>
&nbsp;This is a good thing.  
<BR>
<P>Natasha
<BR>
<P>&quot;The best defense?  Make ideas happen.&quot;
