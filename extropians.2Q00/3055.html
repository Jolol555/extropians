<P><EM>&gt; Seriously, though, Eliezer, when a person is in utter despair, their

<EM>&gt; reality is so completely distorted, that one can't remotely imagine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that happiness will ever again be possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.  Thats where the mental discipline comes in: one must
<BR>
tell themselves, we've been thru this before, the sun came out before,
<BR>
it will do so again.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One thing that you didn't mention in your message was the value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of vigorous exercise to combat despair.
</EM><BR>
<P>Heres something I found helpful.  I noticed that when I am despair,
<BR>
I eat less and sleep more.  To get back to normal, I tried eating
<BR>
more and sleeping less.  This helped to a certain extent.  This is
<BR>
the part that may sound absurd, because I am an engineer, not a
<BR>
poet, so I can only wish I had better words to describe these feelings,
<BR>
or had scored a few hundred points higher on the verbal SAT.
<BR>
<P>I have found there is some value in letting grief run its course,
<BR>
without trying to interrupt it.  If it can be done without life-threatening
<BR>
consequences, I have found it is OK to go ahead and stare into
<BR>
that abyss, as Amara has so eloquently discribed the feeling.  I
<BR>
have experienced depression as a phase in a cycle.  To let it
<BR>
run its course is the way to continue on to the next cycle.  spike
