<EM>&gt; I agree. He was trying to show that the phrenologists probably made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systematic errors without really being aware of it. It is just that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certain seemingly commonsense decisions in the process actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; escaped clear thinking. Political influences, might have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; favoured a particular result, and if research happened to lead to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; results in accord with this, there may have been less motive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to check results thoroughly.
</EM><BR>
<P>My point was not that this didn't happen, but that Gould uses it to prop up
<BR>
his argument(s) against general intelligence (and heritability of
<BR>
intelligence in general).  Has anyone, aside from me, actually read any of
<BR>
Arthur Jensen's work?  (Jensen is one researcher who Gould vehemently
<BR>
attacks in _The Mismeasure of Man_.  For the record, I'm not some scholar of
<BR>
this area, but I did read Jensen's _The Straight Talk About IQ Testing_)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think that the argument for cultural bias, at least in the earlier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; versions of IQ tests, is well presented. The tests depicted in his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; book were ridiculously parochial (like knowing details of certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; American sports), considering they were given to immigrants.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  Any test is going to have some bias.  Stuff like this is easy to
<BR>
uncover, however.  And the goals of the people giving such tests was often
<BR>
related to an overt political agenda.
<BR>
<P>Some extremely cultural neutral tests have been developed which use pure
<BR>
symbols to do things like pattern matching, simple induction, and so forth.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From what little I've read, there's a strong correlation between people who
</EM><BR>
do well on conventional IQ tests and these unconventional ones.  It's not
<BR>
100%, but it is high enough to perhaps make a case for general intelligence.
<BR>
<P>(The real problem with IQ Testing is not so much that the tests are biased,
<BR>
but that people tend to think not scoring high on them means they are not
<BR>
good and that their potential is lower.  Granted, higher IQ usually means,
<BR>
ceterus paribus, a lot more possibilities are open to one, BUT there are
<BR>
plenty of genius IQs (140+) I know who are not really doing all that much
<BR>
and who do not stay all that active in life itself, whether this be in
<BR>
intellectual concerns or everything else.  In fact, some of them are
<BR>
downright boring people.  One person I used to work with, who was genius
<BR>
level was also one of the most repressed people I ever met.  He was not the
<BR>
kind of guy I'd want to invite to a party or hang out with -- even to talk
<BR>
about intellectual stuff.:/)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even if Gould falsely one-sidedly motives to particular scientists,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this doesn't seem to me to discredit the basic idea of hidden
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prejudices/ sloppy thinking.  Whether deliberate or unconscious, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; result is distortion. Scientists *are* human, and although the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientific method correctly applied ought to guard against mistakes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they DO happen. People can have a lot on their minds.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, but to reduce all error to ideological bias is as large of a
<BR>
mistake.  I have never made the claim that scientists and other researchers
<BR>
are infalliable, perfect thinkers.  I do, however, reiterate the claim that
<BR>
not all bias and sloppy thinking is as Gould makes it seem.  If it were,
<BR>
then only drastic political changes would ever change science.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Surely, all sorts of thinkers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; err, but they do not always err because of their political views.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  No, but it can happen and should be considered.
</EM><BR>
<P>But my point was not that they don't ever, just that they don't always.  (I
<BR>
wish people would read what I write.  I tend to be very careful and to
<BR>
qualify my statements, often allowing precision to overcome style in doing
<BR>
so.:)  I think Gould is quick to look for a political explanation for
<BR>
disagreement.  Lots of other people are like this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Hopefully some thinkers might change their politics instead.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's hardly an issue here.  The issue is: should people allow their
<BR>
political views to color their nonpolitical thinking, especially in the area
<BR>
of science?  Gould is guilty of this because he allows his own prejudices to
<BR>
overcome his scholarship at many points.  (Note: for the reading challenged,
<BR>
I typed &quot;many.&quot;  &quot;Many&quot; does not mean &quot;all.&quot;  If any if you decide to
<BR>
criticize my statement, please be sure to keep this difference in mind.:)
<BR>
<P>And when the Singularity comes, we can have whatever IQ we want.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
