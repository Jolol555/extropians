<EM>&gt; &gt; Jesus, this is frustrating.  What do you think we've been doing for

<EM>&gt; &gt; 20 years?  Do you think we haven't been trying like hell to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; _allowed_ in the debates?  Do you think we haven't been sending
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; releases to the press every week for years?  Do you think we haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; been using paper, the web, and every other medium available to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the message out?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From personal experience?  No.  Or rather, yes, but ineffectively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough that it might as well be no, which is part of the problem, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have seen how these media are used.  See below.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It doesn't matter that nearly every radio talk show host in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; country hs called or including the LP in debates.  It doesn't matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that most newspapers have as well.  It doesn't matter that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; league of women voters (who used to sponsor the big debate) called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for inclusion.  The Ds &amp; Rs took over the process and created the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;non-partisan&quot; commission on debates specifically for the partisan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; purpose of keeping out the LP, and as long as the television network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; media let them get away with it, it will work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It sounds like the ones you need to work on here aren't the D/Rs, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the television networks themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>The TV networks are right in bed with the Republicratic power clique. The only
<BR>
tv that has given anywhere near a fair level of coverage consistently is C-SPAN.
<BR>
The dems know that if the LP got anything like decent coverage that they'd lose
<BR>
a lot of voters, the types who are fiscal conservatives but just can't stand the
<BR>
moral parsimoniousness of the religious wing of the GOP, then you've got the
<BR>
members of the GOP that aren't in the pockets of the mercantilists or beholden
<BR>
to the fundamentalists that would split to the LP in a minute if it looked like
<BR>
they had half a fair shake. We almost got that in 1992. Three republicans and a
<BR>
democrat in the NH statehouse defected to the LP. Then the D/R members that
<BR>
control the state election commission upped the number of votes you need to get
<BR>
your party on the ballot, and they then went after the defectors and ran them
<BR>
out of office or put the squeeze on them to return to the fold.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For instance, if you can document
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how non-D/R candidates are systematically barred (and you probably can),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *especially* if you can give it the stench of illegality (this might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a bit more difficult), it might make for a good 60 Minutes story.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problems that McCain had getting on the GOP primary ballot in New York
<BR>
barely made a ripple in the news, and that was the height of corrupt local
<BR>
machine politics. You think the networks are going to risk white house press
<BR>
accessibility for the sake of a party that can't get more than 2 million votes?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the D/Rs won't acknowledge your existence, create controversy - which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the media *will* lap up - until they do.  (Take as an example Perot's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; '92 shot, which started in basically your situation - with more money,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps, but probably not with as much political experience - and got on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the public radar.)  Either way, you get the message that you exist into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the public consciousness.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perot got media attention because he was a demagogue who said funny things,
<BR>
looked funny, had a good story, and was willing to spend tens of millions of
<BR>
dollars to make sure people paid attention to him.
<BR>
<P>If for instance, Bill Gates suddenly had a political religious experience and
<BR>
converted from his smarmy mercantilist democrat leanings to libertarianism, and
<BR>
he decided to run for the LP candidacy, retired from Microsoft, and started
<BR>
making stump speeches about how the whole anti trust thing is just one more
<BR>
socialist propaganda war, that nobody should have to pay income taxes, etc. and
<BR>
he backed it up with a hundred million of his own bucks, you can bet there will
<BR>
be a lot more interest in the LP. There would be a lot of left-libertarians
<BR>
pissed at him, but that would make for a good media showdown between
<BR>
socialist-libertarians and capitalist-libertarians...
