<P>
The Matrix has deeper problems than human-Duracell and &quot;why is he
<BR>
using Kung fu in the first place?&quot; if you make any attempt to assume
<BR>
that the Matrix is virtual reality, but it resolves its own problems
<BR>
if you grant it its ontological presuppositions.
<BR>
<P>The Matrix is NOT virtual reality.  You DON'T die when your VR Avatar
<BR>
dies, unless the system is specifically designed to kill you when that
<BR>
happens.  What's Morpheus's explanation for this?  &quot;The body cannot
<BR>
live without the Mind.&quot;  Oh, yeah.  THAT explains it.
<BR>
<P>Here's the can-stand-on-two-feet-barely explanation:
<BR>
<P>The Matrix is not a set of funny sensations sent to your nervous
<BR>
system.  It's an array of Consciousnesses, of the spooky variety.
<BR>
Think &quot;souls&quot; here.  These AIs are not Turing machines.  They're
<BR>
Artificial Consciousnesses.  (How they got to be that way is up to
<BR>
you.)
<BR>
<P>So, for the confused:
<BR>
<P>In this movie, Consciousness has a linguistic component, represented
<BR>
by the &quot;code&quot; of the Matrix.  The rules of the Matrix are the rules
<BR>
generated by the Consciousnesses in the Matrix via belief; strong
<BR>
enough beliefs can and do change the rules.  [&quot;You can't be dead,
<BR>
because I love you.&quot;]
<BR>
<P>The Matrix is not a computer, though it has some robots.  The AIs can
<BR>
change the rules both via beliefs as well as by Fully Understanding
<BR>
(tm) the code.  Neo can too, only, for some reason (some SPOOKY
<BR>
reason), he's better at it than they are.  This IS spooky, and has
<BR>
nothing to do with bandwidth.  This is metaphysical humanism, NOT hard
<BR>
science.  (Look at their message!  Why would they care about hard
<BR>
science?  Look at how awful their science is!)  One of the niftiest
<BR>
and most useful tricks you can perform via Complete Understanding (tm)
<BR>
is tabernacling into the object of your choice: if you have that kind
<BR>
of transcendental knowledge of a person in the Matrix, you control
<BR>
them completely, even to the point of acting through / replacing them.
<BR>
The AIs can do this to most of the unawakened people in the Matrix.
<BR>
Neo's good enough that he can do it to the AIs.  (ACs?  ASouls?)
<BR>
<P>The Matrix has no hard science explanation.  Do not seek one out; do
<BR>
not try to rewrite it so it acquires one.  Not even an explanation
<BR>
like: &quot;The movie claims that all our physics is wrong, so everything
<BR>
that happens in it could happen in whatever physical universe they
<BR>
inhabit.&quot;  That's fine if you're willing to call metaphysical humanism
<BR>
a physical theory, but the movie just doesn't bow to realism, and to
<BR>
fully enjoy it, you have to come to terms with that.  :)
<BR>
<P>Under the right interpretation, you can rescue the Oracle, as well as
<BR>
The One, and even the Duracell batteries as elements in the Matrix
<BR>
ruleset believed in by its participants.
<BR>
<P>Now make an RPG out of THAT.
<BR>
<P>Oh, right, that would be Mage or Changeling, depending on your mood. ;)
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-unless you love someone-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-nothing else makes any sense-
<BR>
