<EM>&gt;Excuse me, but isn't this discussion rather pointless?

<EM>&gt;I think it is more important to be a cosmopolitan than a patriot, because 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nations are just construtions. What distinguishes a Mexican from a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Honduran? Nothing, just political boundaries. And I personally see that I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have more in common with people on this international list than with most 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Swedes.

<EM>&gt;Fighting for civil liberties is very good, but just doing it in your own 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;country won't do it, because the world is so closely connected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Think locally, act globally!
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you are right in that, however you can't do something that radical 
<BR>
without starting gradually, first you have to assure that the place of land 
<BR>
you live aka country has a democratic government with the wish to cooperate 
<BR>
with their neighboors, when that starts to happen, the exchange of culture 
<BR>
and economies, starts to blur the barrier between them and help us be more 
<BR>
a global village, however like you've seen not all people thinks in this 
<BR>
way, and the antiglobal sentiment is very high, still I predict that 
<BR>
countries will start to disappear gradually as more and more people gets 
<BR>
connected, when we get higher bandwidth for all, and the emerging vr 
<BR>
technologies are perfected it won't matter anymore where you are from but 
<BR>
who you are.
