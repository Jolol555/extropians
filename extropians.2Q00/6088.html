<P>
Let's face it.  Delaney is an idiot.  We all know he's an idiot.  The
<BR>
quality of this list would go up immensely if we declared and kept a
<BR>
policy of kicking idiots off the list.
<BR>
<P>And no, nothing will go wrong if we kick Delaney off the list. 
<BR>
Heartwarming sentiments to the contrary, there is often very little to
<BR>
be learned from arguing with idiots.  He has no valuable contributions
<BR>
to make.  If this were one of my mailing lists, he'd have been out of
<BR>
here days ago.
<BR>
<P>I realize that the Extropy Institute feels an obligation to allow free
<BR>
debate, but I continue to insist that, in fact, this policy accomplishes
<BR>
nothing.  We would all be having a lot more fun if someone formed a
<BR>
Committee on Un-Extropian Activities that would ruthlessly mock every
<BR>
post that didn't have something useful to say.  We can all tell the
<BR>
difference between Eliezer daring to question Dynamic Optimism and posts
<BR>
from Luddites who happened to wander onto the list.  We can all tell the
<BR>
difference in our sleep.  *It's not that hard.*
<BR>
<P>There is absolutely no danger that Extropy will ever form a cult, and I
<BR>
don't think that all the scruples are worth all the spam. 
<BR>
Extropianism's cultural anxiety about social uniformity does us all
<BR>
credit, but I think it's time for us to get over it.  We couldn't form a
<BR>
dogma if we tried.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Eliezer.
