<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Can%20I%20kill%20a%20Copy?%20(long)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000504224653.13772.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt;It took a lot of thought, but I finally have an explanation for my position
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the question of killing copies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Killing a sentient being, whether an identical twin, an exact replica of you 
<BR>
or even a sentient computer, should be a crime.  If it is sentient (and 
<BR>
perhaps even if it is not) it has rights, first and foremost to life.  I 
<BR>
realize the thrust of your post wasn't exactly &quot;when is it OK to murder a 
<BR>
sentient being?&quot;  But you did seem to believe its OK for you to do away with 
<BR>
an intelligent being, so long as the intelligent being is an exact replica 
<BR>
of you.  Those on the list who feel that way, may want to try putting 
<BR>
themselves in the shoes of the replica and imagining how they'd feel about 
<BR>
such a policy.
<BR>
<P><P>-Zero

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
