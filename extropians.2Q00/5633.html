<P>
I personally live in one of the most dangerous cities in Europe: Stockholm.
<BR>
<P>You think it is strange? Well, Stockholm has in all its recorded history 
<BR>
been a violent city. For instance, today Los Angeles has a murder rate of 
<BR>
about 10.8 murders on every 100 000 inhabitants, Stockholm has 10.2! 
<BR>
Stockholm is the only metropolitan area in Sweden though, so the average 
<BR>
crime rate is comparatively low. The violence in Swedish society is also 
<BR>
very much concentrated on specific segments of society. Most often those 
<BR>
segments that don't receive much media coverage. &quot;Bum A and Bum B met at Bum 
<BR>
A's ratty apartement and started drinking, then Bum B killed Bum A in 
<BR>
drunken stupor&quot;, is the average Swedish murder, nothing sassy to write 
<BR>
about. But the violence is very much present in Stockholm, and its expanding 
<BR>
outside the usual segments of society.
<BR>
<P>Europe often points fingers at the US for its crime rate, while conveniently 
<BR>
forgetting its often higher (or at least comparable) crime rates. The US is 
<BR>
often more heterogenous that the European countries (that have been heavily 
<BR>
centralized) so comparisions between European countries and the US are often 
<BR>
not that good.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Waldemar
