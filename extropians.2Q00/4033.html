<EM>&gt;     As a bit of an artist myself (i'm not sure which bit) I have always
</EM><BR>
taken
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;...I know what I like&quot; train of thought.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only curious: what art does Alex do?  I dabble in poetry, drawing, painting,
<BR>
and short stories.  In the past, I tried music and still have the urge to
<BR>
try that again.
<BR>
<P>While I'm not strictly against the &quot;I know what I like&quot; school of art
<BR>
criticism, I don't think it's the end of esthetics.  After all, the question
<BR>
is still there of why one likes what one likes.  Also, the question of why
<BR>
all human societies have art while extant nonhumans appear not to have it
<BR>
remains.  Also, the major art forms -- literature, painting, sculpture, and
<BR>
music -- seem universal in human cultures.  Regardless of one's stand on
<BR>
Rand's esthetics, these are still intriguing questions which she tried to
<BR>
answer or, at least, provide a framework for further research on.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; IMHO Vangough couldn't paint
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for toffee, his pictures belong in  a school corridor somewhere with a
</EM><BR>
label
<BR>
<EM>&gt; saying &quot;1st year art class&quot;. On the other hand the work of Picasso amuzes
</EM><BR>
me
<BR>
<EM>&gt; greatly and I like it. This is my taste and I don't feel have to defend
</EM><BR>
it.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; If someone thinks its worth hanging in a gallery and putting a
</EM><BR>
multimillion
<BR>
<EM>&gt; price tag on it, thats fine by me and I respect their taste.
</EM><BR>
<P>No arguing with that.  No one really has to defend their taste.  Personally,
<BR>
I don't like and have never like Picasso, but I love van Gogh.  I didn't
<BR>
always feel this way about him, but the more I've looked at his works --
<BR>
quite a number in the flesh -- the more I like them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     Nothing winds me up more than some jumped up &quot;insert expletive here&quot;
</EM><BR>
who
<BR>
<EM>&gt; thinks they have the right to tell me what is and what isn't good art. I
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; never read any of Rand's opinions and don't intend to. Like wise my view
</EM><BR>
on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; most critics is that can stick them, I have my own mind and my own
</EM><BR>
opinion.
<BR>
<P>I don't think Rand was asking you to substitute her mind and opinion for
<BR>
anyone's in her _The Romantic Manifesto_.  Even by her explicit theory, she
<BR>
distinguishes between personal tastes and esthetic evaluation/judgment.  She
<BR>
even gives examples of works she thinks are great but which did not like and
<BR>
works she likes which are not great by her standards.
<BR>
<P>This is where the popular notion of &quot;guilty pleasures&quot; comes in.  No doubt,
<BR>
some of this is due to leftover cultural elitism, but I don't think this
<BR>
makes it completely invalid.  After all, sometimes our ideal of ourself is
<BR>
out of line with the reality.  Okay, most times our ideal is out of line
<BR>
with it.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     As for modern art, I can take it or leave it. I know one thing, I
</EM><BR>
don't
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have room for half a picked Cow in my front room.
</EM><BR>
<P>:)
