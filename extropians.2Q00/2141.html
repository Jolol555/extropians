<P>
Ah, the rudeness argument.  Lee, I think you've catalyzed this minor war
<BR>
at least three or four times over the years...  I happen to have found it
<BR>
pretty enlightening.  :)
<BR>
<P>My two cents:
<BR>
<P>It is obvious that one can imagine lots of examples in which being
<BR>
courteous would maximize the speaker's self interests, in much the same
<BR>
way that you can imagine being dishonest might maximize self interests.
<BR>
It's also easy to see that, at least in some cases, courtesy can maximize
<BR>
total interests of individuals, a la utilitarianism.  In general, the idea
<BR>
that one should be courteous at least SOME of the time, even in cases
<BR>
which aren't strictly &quot;self defense,&quot; has its place in any
<BR>
consequentialist act theory.  (Though I doubt that you hold such a theory,
<BR>
Lee.)
<BR>
<P>More generally, I think I can make the stronger case that this doesn't
<BR>
just happen in rare instances.  By and large, WHENEVER you're trying to
<BR>
convince someone that something is true, *whenever* you make a statement
<BR>
in the simple indicative mood, you're almost certain to be more convincing
<BR>
to a person if you don't call them an idiot or refer to their ideas as
<BR>
idiotic, and, of course, they're very likely to be happier about it to the
<BR>
extent that you avoid doing so, people being as they are.  (Though it
<BR>
might be better if they were otherwise.)
<BR>
<P>So, if you happen to be an act consequentialist, there's a strong argument
<BR>
in favor of taking &quot;be courteous&quot; as a rule of thumb.
<BR>
<P>You might admit all this, even admitting to me the advantages of courtesy
<BR>
as a rule of thumb, but you might go on to say &quot;but whenever courtesy gets
<BR>
in the way of honesty, honesty should win out.  If I believe that X is
<BR>
stupid, then, it's usually dishonest to withhold information like that.
<BR>
And, since stupidity is rampant, as everyone agrees, courtesy all too
<BR>
often has to take a backseat.  So I quite often SHOULDN'T be courteous;
<BR>
quite often indeed.&quot;
<BR>
<P>As I see it, most of those who have criticized you on this argument try to
<BR>
challenge your view that it is dishonest to withhold that your opponents
<BR>
or your opponents' ideas are stupid.  More generally, even if they ARE
<BR>
stupid, some would say, you still shouldn't SAY as much.
<BR>
<P>I'm going to take a different tack entirely and make a completely
<BR>
different argument:  most people, most ideas, even the most wrong ones,
<BR>
aren't stupid.  On the contrary, most views are quite reasonable.  
<BR>
They're the sort of views that reasonable and respectable people hold.  
<BR>
Even to the extent that they're wrong, it's VERY understandable how a
<BR>
reasonable person could come to believe what they believe.  More
<BR>
generally, almost every position which various thinkers have taken
<BR>
seriously over the years has been a reasonable position to take, even if
<BR>
many or even most of those positions are wrong.
<BR>
<P>Anyone who reasons in day to day life, yet turns out to be mistaken in
<BR>
some matter or other, must be familiar with examples in which reasonable
<BR>
beliefs, even the MOST reasonable beliefs, by almost any standard of
<BR>
reason, turn out to be wrong.  Smokers live to be a hundred.  People win
<BR>
the lottery.  Information is incomplete.  Best guesses are only guesses,
<BR>
and all too often turn out wrong.
<BR>
<P>Certainly those cases of incomplete information lead us to conclude
<BR>
wrongly even when our capacity to reason is working perfectly.  But even
<BR>
broader and totally contradictory positions in ethics, politics and
<BR>
religion can look reasonable if you view them with an eye towards the
<BR>
principle of charity, as well as the principle of humanity.
<BR>
<P>Could you imagine a reasonable person holding that negative freedom is NOT
<BR>
an important good?  What sort of first principles would they have to adopt
<BR>
in order to believe such a thing?  What sort of experiences would a person
<BR>
have to have in order for them to conclude that something like that were
<BR>
true?
<BR>
<P>What sort of axioms would have to be right in order for a belief in God to
<BR>
be justified?  Or for atheism to look implausible?  What would it be like
<BR>
to believe this?  How did that guy so-and-so, an otherwise excellent
<BR>
reasoner, come to reach this conclusion whereas we did not?
<BR>
<P>Working from a principle of charity and a principle of humanity, you'll
<BR>
find that it's easy to imagine yourself, or someone else whose capacity to
<BR>
reason is just as great as your own, coming to believe some things which
<BR>
are drastically different from what you believe.  If you can't see this,
<BR>
then you may lack a certain very important virtue which we human beings
<BR>
would do well to cultivate: empathy.  When you imagine a reasonable person
<BR>
believing the ideas, it becomes harder and harder to justify to one's self
<BR>
the claim that this idea or that person or that movement or that -ism is
<BR>
stupid.
<BR>
<P>Try it and see.
