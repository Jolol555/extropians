<P>&lt;&lt; The true test of any system of rights is whether it protects the people 
<BR>
that
<BR>
&nbsp;no one likes. If Microsoft can be subjected to arbitrary, senseless (and
<BR>
&nbsp;expensive) penalties just because it is unpopular, then so can anyone else
<BR>
&nbsp;the public doesn't like. Since I qualify as a member of at least a
<BR>
&nbsp;half-dozen unpopular groups, I find that a rather ominous trend.

For what its worth, I happended to catch the MacNeil Leher reporth other 
<BR>
night and they panelists who were computer industry &quot;experts&quot; seemed to agree 
<BR>
that the break-up was a good idea and that MS would be more valuable then 
<BR>
ever. Included in this &quot;august&quot; group was Jaron Lanier, who was also keen on 
<BR>
this reformation of Gatesville. Now maybe this group just represented 
<BR>
propaganda, but basically I have slowly come to agree that innovation needs 
<BR>
to be promoted, and that clearing the decks at MS might be a good way. We 
<BR>
shall see if crow appears on my menu in a few years.
