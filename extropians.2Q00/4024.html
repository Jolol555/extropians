<EM>&gt; I don't owe anybody anything, of course, but I've been doing something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's bad for me and in a small way bad for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Transhumanist/Extropian community. Apologizing to myself feels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insubstantial, so I'm apologizing to you. I periodically disappear from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all fora and stop reading even the list that I myself run. I get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overwhelmed by everthing that's going on, all the information that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comes pouring in. Maybe I'm afraid of succeeding at what I most want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do.
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the weaknesses of &quot;electronic communities&quot; is that we don't notice
<BR>
when people leave.  If Sasha didn't have real-life contacts we might not
<BR>
even be aware of his passing.  We have had many people come and go over
<BR>
the years, often without much notice.
<BR>
<P>It would be different if we were all meeting in the physical world, at
<BR>
a bar or a club, getting to know each other and talking the night away.
<BR>
If we met regularly, then when someone stopped showing up, we'd notice.
<BR>
Maybe one of us would give him a call or drop by just to make sure he
<BR>
was OK.
<BR>
<P>This doesn't happen very much in our online communities.  I think this
<BR>
is in large part because we can't see who's here!  We only see who is
<BR>
talking, we can't tell who is listening.  If someone stops posting,
<BR>
has he lost interest, become depressed, or merely decided to observe
<BR>
for a while without saying much?
<BR>
<P>Also, even if we do assume that silence is a sign of absence, it's not
<BR>
that easy to remember who is here and who has left.  We have a great
<BR>
many posters who are active in any given span of weeks, often hundreds
<BR>
of individuals.  That's a lot of people to keep track of.  Plus, the
<BR>
&quot;From&quot; line in an email message is not as distinctive and memorable as
<BR>
the appearance and sound of a person you meet physically.  It lacks body,
<BR>
substance, to help you fix him in your memory.
<BR>
<P>I looked back at the archive for two years ago, and I saw many familiar
<BR>
names who were once active but who have not posted recently (not the past
<BR>
month, anyway): CALYK, Damien Sullivan, Dan Clemmensen, den Otter, Erik
<BR>
Moeller, Grant Sparks, Hara Ra, J.R. Molloy, Mark Crosby, Mark Grant,
<BR>
Michael Nielsen, Nick Bostrom, Randall R. Randall, Scott Badger, Tony
<BR>
Belding, Tony Hollick, Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure most of these people are doing fine, and have just gone on to
<BR>
other things.  But it is strange to have all these departed ones who are
<BR>
around only in memory, ghosts who haunt our electronic gathering place.
