<P>
Robin forwards Moravec:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; An
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immortal cannot hope to survive unchanged, only to maintain a limited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continuity over the short run. Personal death differs from this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inevitability only in its relative abruptness.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a dilemma, but I'm not sure I agree with Moravec's experession
<BR>
of it.  He suggests that change will be forced on us by evolution and
<BR>
competition, leading to some inevitable common outcome.  This would be
<BR>
a sort of monocultural climax ecosystem.
<BR>
<P>However we see here on Earth a diverse ecology which includes organisms
<BR>
that cover a wide spectrum of rates of adaption.  There are species
<BR>
which are almost unchanged from hundreds of millions of years ago,
<BR>
and others which are less than a million years old.  This suggests
<BR>
that the ultimate end point is not necessarily the same for everyone,
<BR>
but may include similar degrees of diversity.
<BR>
<P>In that case we have a choice, not between adapt or perish, but between
<BR>
adapt or stagnate.  It may turn out that there is an ecological niche
<BR>
for organisms who are wedded to their past, who refuse to change.
<BR>
Their very stubbornness will become their raison d'etre.  They are
<BR>
monuments to themselves, as unchanging as stone.
<BR>
<P>This is not a very appealing picture for Extropians, but it does seem
<BR>
that the alternative leads to the kind of outcome Moravec describes.
<BR>
Even if we embrace change, not because the universe forces it upon us,
<BR>
but for our own philosophical reasons, the outcome may be much the same
<BR>
in either case.  We will become unrecognizable to ourselves, like the
<BR>
character in Egan's Diaspora who had rewritten himself so many times he
<BR>
considered himself his own grandchild.
<BR>
<P>It is still a more optimistic picture than Moravec's, because even if
<BR>
we change as much or more than when we die, it is still our own choice
<BR>
and our own path.  His more pessimistic view assumes that the path is
<BR>
not ours to choose, that competition is so harsh that we have no control
<BR>
over where we end up.
