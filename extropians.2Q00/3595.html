<P>No kidding?
<BR>
<P>You forgot to mention that if you let your door wide open on your house,
<BR>
you might get unwanted guests in your house.
<BR>
<P>Can we not simply sum up the facts once and for all for the FAQs:
<BR>
<P>&lt;rant&gt;
<BR>
Microsoft Corporation has decided that giving the Microsoft Windows systems
<BR>
good security would cost too much to implement, and so the users of those
<BR>
systems lose big time.  Since appropriate security is available with other
<BR>
systems, those who decide to use Microsoft Windows should either replace it
<BR>
with something secure, or stop whining about it.
<BR>
<P>If the users really cared, they could join up with torches and pitchforks
<BR>
outside chairman Gates' residence, and demand security.  Since they don't,
<BR>
they really don't care, and therefore they have themselves to blame.
<BR>
&lt;/rant&gt;
<BR>
<P>BTW, I happened to sit on a public transport some time ago and overheard
<BR>
the discussion between two humans. They discussed games, more games, and
<BR>
even more games. They discussed using online games, and then one of them
<BR>
told the other that the XYZ games site sucked, since you had to download
<BR>
and install security software on your machine. &quot;I didn't since there are
<BR>
so much junk on it already.&quot;  Then they complaind about getting hacked..
