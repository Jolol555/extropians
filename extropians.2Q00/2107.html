<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that this was a comparison of a generation #1 product with a

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; ease-of-installation bracket as MacOS.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As a brief point (maybe I'm jumping ahead of Michael here), it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; probably not quite correct to say Corel's is generation #1, being built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on a good deal of Linux development in general, and specifically being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; derived from Debian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Quite so. I expect any improvements Corel developed will quickly find their way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the gestalt of other distros and that Corels will improve much quicker than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their other product lines as well. I'd say that compared to a gen1 product like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the alpha release of Win95, there is some comparable ease of install and use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issues, for sure, but with the current level of maturity (and considering that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; linux has many tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working on improving it, MS has never had more than a few thousand people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working on windows upgrades at any given time, so logically, Linux should be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more mature, stable, easy to use, easy to install OS by now. It isn't.
</EM><BR>
<P>'Mature' is subjective, but Linux's basement on the long-standing Unix
<BR>
principles contributes a lot to a possible argument that Linux *is*
<BR>
mature.
<BR>
<P>I would argue that it already is the more stable. I have never had a
<BR>
non-development kernel or system daemon fail on me, in what over all
<BR>
my machines adds up to several years of uptime.
<BR>
<P>Ease of use is something that's only really been taken up into 
<BR>
development recently. A lot of Linux software is still very much 
<BR>
by-techies for-techies. Remember that despite an impression some 
<BR>
rather loud people may well have given you, Linux is not a project 
<BR>
to take over the world's computer systems. Except from the point of 
<BR>
view of the distribution companies, who - guess what - are now 
<BR>
paying programmers to work on ease-of-use aspects.
<BR>
<P>Similarly ease of installation, of course.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why is that?
</EM><BR>
<P>A good quick answer is: because most of them aren't being paid!
<BR>
<P><P>Martin
<BR>
<P>(also - perhaps we've taken the 'generation' descriptions somewhat
<BR>
differently. I would not have said Win95 was a first generation product,
<BR>
since it builds a lot on DOS and earlier Windows versions. I suggest we
<BR>
avoid the terminlogy, since it is ambiguous and depends on making
<BR>
difficult and somewhat pointless comparisons).
