<EM>&gt; you don't have the economic resources to be innovative, people in the

<EM>&gt; welfare states are poor- the government is rich.

<P><P>This is a lucid and concise expression of the problem with welfare states
<BR>
with respect to transhumanism in general.
<BR>
<P>Most innovation in the world is driven by self-interest, whether it is a
<BR>
profit motive or simply curiousity and knowledge-seeking as its own
<BR>
reward.  All these activities that lead to innovation require an
<BR>
investment by the individual, be it time, money, or some other form of
<BR>
investment.  Most innovation is done either by wealthy individuals, who
<BR>
have the option of pursuing their interest at their leisure, or
<BR>
individuals who are supported by wealthy entities expressly for the
<BR>
purpose of pursuing interests that may not be economically productive.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, welfare states make it difficult to become wealthy.  Wealth
<BR>
is built on investments of time and money, and often works best when such
<BR>
investments are frontloaded.  If most of the money Americans spent on
<BR>
taxes was invested instead, the average American would be a millionaire by
<BR>
the time they were 40.  Most people would become permanently
<BR>
self-supporting, rather than the small number that manages now.  This is
<BR>
what bothers me most.  The most productive and innovative individuals in a
<BR>
society waste a large percentage of their resources supporting the
<BR>
non-productive, with the net effect of not allowing the productive
<BR>
individuals to accumulate enough resources to *really* do something
<BR>
useful.  Instead, all the productive people are forced to invest their
<BR>
time and money towards worthless ends.  Additionally, most people could
<BR>
afford to become benefactors if their weren't taxed so severely in the
<BR>
first place.
<BR>
<P>Among my objections to government welfare is the enormous amount of waste
<BR>
involved.  I decided to look up the relevant US figures for 1990 (a year
<BR>
with readily available stats), and the figures are disturbing.  The amount
<BR>
spent per recipient was almost *twice* the income poverty line.  We could
<BR>
save 100 billion dollars just by cutting every recipient a check equal
<BR>
to the official poverty line.
<BR>
<P>I think far more people would be helped if we just abolished the thing and
<BR>
gave people the means to help each other.  It would also give people the
<BR>
choice between giving money to a needy person/deadbeat/etc. and investing
<BR>
the same money in ventures that will have a more beneficial impact.
<BR>
<P>Another statistic that should bother the more-or-less pro-welfare crowd: 
<BR>
Over the long-term in the US, as the amount spent per person on welfare has
<BR>
increased, the number of eligible recipients also has increased.
