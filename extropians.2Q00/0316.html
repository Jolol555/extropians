<P><EM>&gt; I don't know why Rand is being brought into this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Because of her anti-Communist ire. 
<BR>
<P>Of course she was correct, as a system it failed. Although beneficently 
<BR>
intended to fill mouths that were previously empty, it soon succumbed to 
<BR>
corruption and the system fell to pieces. Since it doesn't promote economic 
<BR>
flourishing, it withers away in entropy like Oroborous - the worm eating it's 
<BR>
own tail. 
<BR>
<P>Communism in it's pure form has been abandoned by all but the most 
<BR>
anachronistic states, and is dying a nasty death. 
<BR>
<P>Cuba is one of those holdovers. If you watched the Ry Cooder/Wim Wender film  
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; - white washed as they tried to make it, you can 
<BR>
see what a trippy place it is ... only cars from the fifties (beautiful!!), 
<BR>
abstract filth, poverty, alcoholism, voodoo, abandoned luxury nightclubs and 
<BR>
dancehalls... the country is experiencing mean hard times ... for decades it 
<BR>
has been...
<BR>
... sigh ... but the music ... ah si ... people are the same everywhere ... 
<BR>
heart and soul, love and laughter -- people will tend to survive.
<BR>
<P>It is not hard to see why the people there have no love of us, and our 
<BR>
freedom and arrogance. I can empathize with his father, and also with the 
<BR>
family here!! 
<BR>
Who, besides his kin who miss him, and who are NOT in this place, would NOT 
<BR>
desire to keep him here, where it is nicer, brighter, cleaner, more sane!!  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Both sides seek to control a life. Both want what is &quot;best&quot; for the boy. 
<BR>
<P>So does Piekoff.
<BR>
<P>There is irony there.
<BR>
<P>You ask why bring did someone bring in Rand?
<BR>
IMO Piekoff is like the loyal puppy dog who needs to bark something every 
<BR>
time he thinks he knows what she *would* have said.  Perhaps he has the 
<BR>
illusion that she has uploaded a copy of herself into his brain...
