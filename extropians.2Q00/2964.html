Subject: RE: Our friend Sasha (was RE: success of cryonics arrangements)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I had not thought to bring up the possibility of human consciousness apart
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the body on this list, since most of the participants seem to see the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mind and body as inseparable and to think of physical immortality as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prerequisite to mental immortality.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think there is a 'reporting' problem here ....... mental immortality might
<BR>
be (theoretically) possible for the subject, but without any physical
<BR>
substrate noone else can have evidence of this continuance.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;However, since Sasha's death, there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been more talk of the possibility that consciousness can exist apart from a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;physical container for some length of time.
</EM><BR>
<P>To understand where consciousness might be going, I have always thought it
<BR>
wise to understand its origins, and specifically the shift from FINITE-STATE
<BR>
E-2 brains to the modern INFINITE-STATE E-1 (minus pineal eye) systems such
<BR>
as our own. Your term &quot;physical container&quot; has a bias in supposing that
<BR>
consciousness is a 'separate' thing that is somehow 'contained' rather than
<BR>
continuous with the physical.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Earlier in this post I mentioned experiences I've had which lead me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believe that our minds are only fragments of a greater intelligence.  One
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;these experiences involves a sort of super-data-base which can be accessed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from altered states of consciousness such as a trance state. I haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;studied enough psychology to know if this is the sort of thing Jung
</EM><BR>
referred
<BR>
<EM>&gt;to as the &quot;collective unconscious&quot; but I've heard the term, and it seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fit the experience.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Bonnie
</EM><BR>
<P>Jung's psychotherapy works very well in practice with lots of people, and I
<BR>
use his Shadow Self theory and techniques quite often with clients. I find
<BR>
his collective unconscious idea more problematic, but it resonates with
<BR>
certain people. MVT overcomes many of the issues that you are concerned
<BR>
with.
