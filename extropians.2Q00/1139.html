<EM>&gt;The only protection offered against illegitimate use of deadly force in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the U.S. is to kill the state agents/police at the time the incident
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;occurs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Murder is *already* a capital offense, even if you are wearing a cop uniform 
<BR>
at the time you commit the murder.  So I assume what you are suggesting is 
<BR>
some sort of summary execution which bypasses the jury trial process, right? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds like a really great plan.  Oh, except for the minor detail 
<BR>
that *no one in their right mind would become a cop*. I'm amazed that they 
<BR>
can hire people as cops now to get paid marginally well to risk their lives 
<BR>
every working hour of the day.  And now, in addition to getting reprimanded, 
<BR>
suspended, fired and sued for making an error, you think they should be 
<BR>
*killed* too?  Yeah, sure I might take that job...if it paid $10 million a 
<BR>
year.
