<P>Zero, I was recently defeated in an eating contest by an 8 yr old boy who
<BR>
wasnt even trying.  This leads me to propose the following eating contest,
<BR>
a switch from the traditional hotdog quaffing competitions at the local
<BR>
4th of July picnic.
<BR>
<P>In this contest, one would see how *little* one can eat.  One would
<BR>
select 10 kg of food and water, and see how long one can survive,
<BR>
but theres a catch.  It isnt just seeing how long one can fast, for one
<BR>
must also maintain ones mass.  For instance, if a contestant weighs
<BR>
in at 70 kg, then the game is over when the combined weight of the
<BR>
contestant and any remaining food and water falls to 70 kg from the
<BR>
original 80 kg total.
<BR>
<P>This particular eating contest would not be harmful to the contestants
<BR>
bodies, like the more traditional eating contests.  There would be no
<BR>
particular advantage to total fasting, or in overstuffing the stomach before
<BR>
the contest, if you think about it.  However I can think of a strategy
<BR>
that might help: to clean out the system beforehand with laxatives and
<BR>
enemas etc, then choose high cal lo fiber food.
<BR>
<P>I think I could go 5 to 8 days on 10 kg of food and water.  If we
<BR>
were to hold such a competition, we would actually generate data
<BR>
useful for planning a Mars mission.  Whaddya think?  Has this been
<BR>
done before?  spike
