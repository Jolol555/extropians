&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what on the face of it seems a cut and dry issue. Criminals want 
<BR>
to hide and the law abiding citizen has no need to fear constant survailence. 
<BR>
hmmmm....
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im not convinced either way. I have been thinking about Transparency in 
<BR>
one form another for several years and my viewpoint has swayed from For to 
<BR>
Against many times.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My current mindset is that in general survailence is primarily good, but 
<BR>
I still have reservations. I would like the peace of mind that if we are 
<BR>
under constant scrutiny that this will in someway make me feel safer. Why 
<BR>
would i need to worry about being mugged if a potentail assailent knew his 
<BR>
actions would be monitored and therefor he has a high risk of being caught. 
<BR>
He is likely not to bother as the risk will be too great. likewise 
<BR>
Burgulars,Car Theives and many other criminals. But then there is still the 
<BR>
&quot;Complete Nutter&quot; who would happily stab you if front of 1000 people so 
<BR>
survailence is not likey to stop this breed of people.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know for sure that In certain circumstances I would not like my every 
<BR>
move to be monitored. I don't like the idea that survailence monitoring 
<BR>
personel might be sitting there laughing and calling over their colegues to 
<BR>
watch me scratch my arse or worse !. Or that a tape of my actions could be 
<BR>
circulating giving people a good laugh.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that with out a doubt the system will be missused. Im sure that 
<BR>
market researchers would pay the earth to monitor consumer and really see 
<BR>
what Joe average gets up to in his everyday life. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a slightly different note but very related. One thing I have thought 
<BR>
about considerably is the Tagging of the general population. By this you have 
<BR>
probably guessed I mean Subcutanious Data transmitters giving the identity 
<BR>
and location of any individual.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see Incredible potential for devices like these. Imagine a scenario 
<BR>
where someone is lost in mountainous terrain, Under an avalanche, at sea, in 
<BR>
the desert, missing children etc etc . No doubt if this system was ever 
<BR>
developed the data would be saved, this would be an exceptional crime 
<BR>
fighting tool. No more false allabies. You could keep constant track off 
<BR>
prisoners and people on parole. Obviously these devices could be tampered 
<BR>
with or removed so doing either would probably be a criminal offence. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, i've rambled enough. Please forgive the bad spelling, i'm a bit 
<BR>
dickslexgick !
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its too late in the day to worry. I'll be the first to sign up for a 
<BR>
spelling chip when  they are invented.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex
