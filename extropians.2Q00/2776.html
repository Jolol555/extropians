<EM>&gt; &gt; He used to be adamantly capitalist/free-market oriented.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Icky-poo.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; However he seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have reached his dotage, and he has taken on a very socialist/mercantilist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stance (which is consistent with his current preference for gold) against free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; markets,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As he said what his reasons are?
</EM><BR>
<P>The usual socialist garbage, essentially its the old 'people are no damn good and need
<BR>
other people to tell them whats best for them' mantra.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; and while he has been funding many enterprise development projects in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Soviet Union, he also funds quite a bit of leftist/liberal political causes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; here in the US, including large amounts of money for gun control groups,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh right so he's a good guy.  I thought you thought he was a bad guy?
</EM><BR>
<P>You might think so, I do not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as support for pro-world government like the World Federalist Society, and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anti-freedom causes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given the current polarisation of the world towards US hegemony, a world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; govt would be a good idea, but I'd rather no governments.
</EM><BR>
<P>Considering that the current UN peace keeping force in Sierra Leone can't seem to
<BR>
shoot its way out of a wet paper bag, and is the largest source of weapons supply for
<BR>
the communist rebels (sounds like  Pournelle novel, doesn't it?) while the private
<BR>
mercenary forces previously sent in by both the South African gov't and the domestic
<BR>
Sierran government were keeping things well under control until kicked out by UN
<BR>
mandate, the UN is possibly the worst possible organization to look out for individual
<BR>
liberty around the world.
