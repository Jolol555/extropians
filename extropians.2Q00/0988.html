<P>
<EM>&gt; I wonder if there is any way to get the Libertarians, or other &quot;third&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parties, seriously campaign?  Yes, I know, they need money which comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from donors exposed to the party by media attracted by the party
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spending money...but how can we get this cycle to *start*, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficient momentum that there would be a significant chance of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-Democrat and non-Republican President of the U.S. next year?  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems like the responsibility lies with these &quot;third&quot; parties to start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting the word out...for instance, challenging the Dem/Rep candidates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to debates *and making a major media flurry - major enough to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noticed by a significant percent of the American public - out of their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lack of response*.
</EM><BR>
<P>Jesus, this is frustrating.  What do you think we've been doing for
<BR>
20 years?  Do you think we haven't been trying like hell to be
<BR>
_allowed_ in the debates?  Do you think we haven't been sending
<BR>
releases to the press every week for years?  Do you think we haven't
<BR>
been using paper, the web, and every other medium available to get
<BR>
the message out?
<BR>
<P>It doesn't matter that nearly every radio talk show host in the
<BR>
country hs called or including the LP in debates.  It doesn't matter
<BR>
that most newspapers have as well.  It doesn't matter that the
<BR>
league of women voters (who used to sponsor the big debate) called
<BR>
for inclusion.  The Ds &amp; Rs took over the process and created the
<BR>
&quot;non-partisan&quot; commission on debates specifically for the partisan
<BR>
purpose of keeping out the LP, and as long as the television network
<BR>
media let them get away with it, it will work.
<BR>
<P>The existing system does everything in its power to supress third
<BR>
parties and keep them out of the process.  We have to spend most of
<BR>
our money just getting ballot access--the major parties talk about
<BR>
the democratic process, but when it threatens their power structure
<BR>
they are quick to subvert it and create barriers to entry, and
<BR>
they get away with it--because ignorant voters just assume that
<BR>
the process is working and the third parties just aren't trying
<BR>
hard enough.
