<P><EM> &gt; I kind of agree, though I think such floor cleaner robots could be built
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; cheaply now.  If you just need a vacuum cleaner that can guide itself, one
</EM><BR>
<P>Not household-usable ones. The amount of crunch and the code for
<BR>
building maps/navigating is very nontrivial. I trust Moravec's
<BR>
expertise on this. However, I'm placing such devices 2010, while he
<BR>
does it iirc 2005.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; could borrow Rodney Brooks model of robotics.  That is build simple,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; basically &quot;stupid&quot; robots that can only do not very complex things like not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; bump into a wall.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is too much that can go wrong with a robot in a house. Not
<BR>
falling down the stair, and not messing up stuff on the floor is very
<BR>
nontrivial. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Since this seems so easy (from my computer desk chair:), I wonder why
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; someone hasn't done it.  After all, there are a lot of big lobbies -- Grand
</EM><BR>
<P>Because it stops looking so easy if you go out, and try to do it.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Central Station, NYC, for example -- and such that could cleaned by such
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; robots.  (I think the average house or apartment would be a bit too much
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; here, but I could be wrong.  Not my area, you know?)
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Anything which is not cluttered, and changes only very slowly, and can 
<BR>
pay a lot for a single installation, is relatively easy.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Also, I believe making robots look humanoid would mostly be a waste.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Designs should be based on cost (including design, manufacturing, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; maintenance) versus functional efficiency.  Even an all around robot
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; probably would not be humanoid.  The only reasons I can see for making some
</EM><BR>
<P>A box with an arm or two would do just fine.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; consumer robots humanoid is for esthetics and for marketing.  Like tail fins
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; on cars.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sony Aibo.
