Ian writes, regarding the Waco report from Vector Data:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    IAN: What the VDS report fails to address is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the multiplicity of flashes in fixed locations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    which is the linchpin of the &quot;gunshot&quot; diagnosis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    In one rotation of Mt Carmel by the FLIR aircraft,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    around 20 shots can be counted in one fixed location.
</EM><BR>
<P>If there were some broken glass at that fixed location, you might well
<BR>
expect to see multiple flashes as you move around it.  This seems to be
<BR>
what the VDS report describes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    Bursts of flashes occur in a mechanical rhythm of 7
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to 10 times per second, like the cyclic rate of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    machinegun.
</EM><BR>
<P>VDS does not discuss this phenomenon, and I'm not sure why.  It is
<BR>
possible that the pattern is not as rhythmic and mechanical as some
<BR>
have led us to believe.  There could also be artifacts introduced in
<BR>
the processing, copying and digitizing of the tape.
<BR>
<P>A certain amount of flicker is to be expected given that the reflective
<BR>
surface is uneven, like broken glass.  It probably wouldn't be at a
<BR>
mechanical, even rate of repetition.  I would like to see a graph which
<BR>
shows the intensity of a flash over time, quantitatively.  This would
<BR>
help to determine whether the supposedly rhythmic pattern to the flashes
<BR>
is actually as mechnical as has been suggested.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    They are also linear and pointed toward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Mt Carmel.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so.  The pixels are very wide, either due to image
<BR>
degradation or the behavior of the camera.  From certain angles, this
<BR>
makes the pixels appear to be linear and oriented toward the compound.
<BR>
And for some reason the flashes are mostly seen from those angles.
<BR>
Are there any instances where there are linear flashes which are in the
<BR>
vertical direction on screen?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    The VDS report fails to include the rate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    of flashes in fixed locations as a critical flash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    attribute in their attribute comparison of the test-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    FLIR to the 1993 FLIR.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is true.  However we would need to see the test footage shot last
<BR>
month to see whether this is actually a gunfire attribute.  VDS used
<BR>
this footage to establish their criteria.  Maybe real gunfire does not
<BR>
show such patterns.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    Their claim that none of 1993
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    flashes have the necessary shadow is just false.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see how you could pick out shadows of gunshots (whatever that
<BR>
means) given the crude resolution of the Waco video.  VDS also talked
<BR>
about stereo imagery.  Is the FLIR a stereo camera?  If so then again
<BR>
they have more video information available than has been shown to the
<BR>
public.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    VDS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    also fails to offer any explanation for how there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    could be multiple solar reflections in fixed locations.
</EM><BR>
<P>On the contrary, this is one of their biggest arguments in favor of
<BR>
the sun reflection theory.  In some cases there are multiple flashes
<BR>
in fixed locations over a prolonged interval (many minutes) while the
<BR>
visible light images show reflective material at that exact location.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    However, in my recent report on the Waco FLIR I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    explore several explanations for how solar reflections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    might duplicate the rapid flashes seen on the FLIR,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    and one just might do it. But counter explanations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    either fail or are far less likely explanations for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    rapid flashes on the FLIR than that they are gunshots,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    which is further supported by whistle-blower testimony
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    that there was a gunfight around the back of Mt Carmel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    See why the rapid flashes are most logically gunshots:

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Part II: <A HREF="http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir03.htm">http://Ian.Goddard.net/waco/flir03.htm</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>I think if you look at the last figure in your flir02 URL above,
<BR>
you see right there a strong argument for the sun reflection theory.
<BR>
All the flash observations are clustered together in the left side of
<BR>
the diagram.  It's true, they aren't right on top of each other, but
<BR>
you'd expect some variation due to uneven ground.  This clustering is
<BR>
hard to explain if it is gunfire.
<BR>
<P>(I believe you suggested that the building would have blocked view of the
<BR>
&quot;shooters&quot; from other directions, but it didn't look to me like there
<BR>
was that much obstruction.  The camera was high overhead and looking
<BR>
down at a steep angle.)
<BR>
<P>Keep in mind, too, that VDS also attributed a number of flashes to heat
<BR>
from the hot underside of the tanks reflecting from debris on the ground.
