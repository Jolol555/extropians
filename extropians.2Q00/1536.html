<P><P><EM>&gt; 1.  &quot;... senses of smell, taste, touch, sight and hearing have decreased

<P>May 20,1998 article: Joseph Chilton Pearce interviewed by Walker
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.ratical.org/many_worlds/JCP98.html">http://www.ratical.org/many_worlds/JCP98.html</A>
<BR>
Walker:
<BR>
Will you speak to the neurological damage in modern children, as you've
<BR>
described in Evolution's End, which renders them &quot;ineducable&quot;?
<BR>
Pearce:
<BR>
It's been ten years since I wrote Evolution's End, and, believe me, the
<BR>
situation today has worsened by thousands of percentile. Most people
<BR>
involved in educational reform are speaking of curricular programs when the
<BR>
truth of the matter is the children they are dealing with now are, by and
<BR>
large, damaged past the point of educability in any real sense. The public
<BR>
has yet to recognize this is so. The clearest indications of such damage
<BR>
recently came out of Tunbingen University in Germany with a twenty year
<BR>
study of four thousand people. It shows three significant findings as a
<BR>
result of the failure to furnish appropriate sensory stimulation for growth.
<BR>
***First, there has been an average of one percent per year reduction in the
<BR>
sensory sensitivity of the human system*** and the ability to bring in
<BR>
information from the outside world. Compared to children twenty years age,
<BR>
the children we are looking at now are comprehending or registering
<BR>
information from their environment at eighty percent, which simply means
<BR>
they are twenty percent less consciously aware of where they are and what is
<BR>
happening around them. Secondly, the kind of stimulus that does break
<BR>
through the reticular activating system in the ancient reptilian brain, the
<BR>
brain stem, is only highly concentrated bursts of over-stimulation. That is,
<BR>
the only signals they're really bringing in from their environment are those
<BR>
bursts of stimuli which are highly charged. If it's sound, it must be a loud
<BR>
sound. If it's touch, it must be an impact. If it's visual, it must be
<BR>
intense. Subtleties cannot catch their attention because they are not
<BR>
sensitive to their environment. One comparison is that twenty years ago a
<BR>
child or young person was able to differentiate 360 shades of red, and today
<BR>
are down to something like 130 shades, which means the subtleties are lost
<BR>
to the pure, heavy impact of red now necessary to penetrate the reticular
<BR>
system. Once we look into the whole developmental system, the implications
<BR>
are profound....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2. &quot;Our brain is not adapting.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3. &quot;Red is no longer real red.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This extract is taken from the heading &quot;Thresholds of the Biological&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Recent studies out of Germany -- from Tuebingen University and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Gesellschaft fur Rationelle Psychologie in Munich -- show that our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contemporary environments have, in fact, already changed our biology. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the last twenty years, from repeated testings of four thousand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; participants, the senses of smell, taste, touch, sight, and hearing have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decreased at a rate of nearly one percent per year. &quot;15 years ago, Germans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could distinguish 300,000 sounds. Today, on average, they only make it to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 180,000. Many children stagnate at 100,000....

<BR>
Are Our Brains Changing?
<BR>
&quot;Our sensitivity to stimuli is decreasing at a rate of about one percent per
<BR>
year. Delicate sensations are simply being filtered out of our
<BR>
consciousness.&quot;
<BR>
[This is one of the conclusions reported in &quot;Research into Changes in Brain
<BR>
Formation,&quot; by Michael Kneissle (Waldorf Education Research Institute
<BR>
Bulletin, June, 1997). The report deals with the research at a couple of
<BR>
German institutions: Gesellschaft fuer Rationelle Psychologie in Munich, and
<BR>
the Institute of Medical Psychology at the University of Tuebingen. The
<BR>
report is not footnoted and is rather poorly and informally presented, so I
<BR>
don't quite know what to make of it -- read on at your own risk.]....
<BR>
<P>You know, Natasha, rather than eulogize the eugenickian evolutionary thrust,
<BR>
can't we just get on with that &quot;Create/Recreate&quot; stuff?  I mean....when the
<BR>
hominid anatomy is squishing multiple functions into dual purpose
<BR>
morphologies, isn't it time to discard some of those paisley and madras
<BR>
_enhancements_?!
