<EM>&gt; Sure, perhaps food production could be done more efficiently, and maybe you

<EM>&gt; have an argument for that.  But to merely compare calories between fossil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fuels and food is a really bad argument.

I've pointed out previously in the list (3-5 months ago) how very poor
<BR>
energy harvesting is in agriculture.  I haven't read all of the thread,
<BR>
but if the point was to promote &quot;green gardening&quot;, they I would argue
<BR>
against it.  You *want* to burn all those fossil fuels in agricultural
<BR>
production and put the CO2 into the atmosphere so there will be lots of
<BR>
&quot;free&quot; carbon available and a big incentive to push for self-replicating
<BR>
nanomachines to remove the carbon for nanotech construction purposes.
<BR>
The loss of life due to &quot;pre-global-warming&quot; will be *very* small
<BR>
compared with the lives saved due to the development of nanotech,
<BR>
nanomedicine, essentially &quot;free&quot; food replicators, etc.
<BR>
<P>IMO, the extropian (rational) position should be to minimize the
<BR>
years of potential life lost given anticipated technology developments.
<BR>
The economic value of keeping humans alive has to be greater than
<BR>
the value of the food they consume (or tradeoffs between the methods
<BR>
used for that).
<BR>
<P>The &quot;classic&quot; green position fails to acknowledge the benefits technologies
<BR>
have and will provide.  Both &quot;greenistic&quot; and &quot;industry-style&quot; agriculture
<BR>
fail by a wide margin in terms of efficiency, supportable population,
<BR>
minimization of land devoted to energy harvesting, etc. when compared
<BR>
with direct conversion of solar energy into food for people via biotech
<BR>
and eventually nanotech.
