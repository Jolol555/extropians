Cornell's new Keck Program in Nanobiotechnology will train

engineer-scientists to link living with mechanical

<BR>
<P><P>ITHACA, N.Y. --The emerging field of nanobiotechnology could hasten the
<BR>
creation of useful ultra-small devices that mimic living biological systems
<BR>
- if only biologists knew more about nanotechnology and engineers
<BR>
understood more biology.
<BR>
<P>They soon will.  Starting in June 2000, the first 12 Ph.D. candidates will
<BR>
hit the laboratories of Cornell University's new W.M. Keck Program in
<BR>
Nanobiotechnology.  The program has been inaugurated with a three-year,
<BR>
$1.2 million grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation of Los Angeles and is
<BR>
expected to receive other sources of support.
<BR>
<P>Keck Fellows will study with Cornell researchers who are working in the
<BR>
&quot;nano&quot; scale  (as small as a few billionths of a meter) to invent hybrid
<BR>
devices that combine the best of the organic and the inorganic, the living
<BR>
and the engineered.  Although this basic research at the interface of
<BR>
engineering and biology does not involve human subjects, the devices that
<BR>
will emerge could someday solve human problems:
<BR>
<P>-- Micro-mobile smart pharmacies, propelled through the human body with
<BR>
biomolecular motors that run on nature's ATPase energy, to dispense
<BR>
precisely metered drugs wherever and whenever cells (such as cancer cells)
<BR>
signal the need.
<BR>
<P>-- Nanofabricated surfaces with structural patterns to grow artificial
<BR>
pancreatic islets and reverse the effects of diabetes - or to grow &quot;neuron
<BR>
repair kits&quot; (brain-cell transplants) for those afflicted with Parkinson's
<BR>
or Alzheimer's disease.
<BR>
<P>-- Super-small, directionally sensitive hearing aids, based on the auditory
<BR>
organ of a tiny parasitic fly that homes in on the mating calls of crickets
<BR>
- as well as locomotory systems for microrobots based on the muscles of the
<BR>
flea, which can jump more than 100 times its own height.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;The first dozen Keck Fellows won't be the first students to cross the
<BR>
organic-inorganic boundary at Cornell.  Already, 12 graduate research
<BR>
assistants work in the Nanobiotechnology Center (NBTC), a national,
<BR>
Cornell-based consortium of institutions, under the direction of Harold
<BR>
Craighead, Cornell professor of applied and engineering physics, that
<BR>
includes the New York State Department of Health's Wadsworth Center, Oregon
<BR>
Health Sciences University and Princeton University.  The center was
<BR>
established last year with $19 million in aid from the National Science
<BR>
Foundation.  The first Keck Fellows will be joined by others as additional
<BR>
funding becomes available.
<BR>
<P>Keck Fellows will be able to earn degrees from departments in any of three
<BR>
colleges at Cornell - Engineering, Arts and Sciences or Agriculture and
<BR>
Life Sciences - and faculty members will come from specialized fields in
<BR>
those colleges.
<BR>
<P>According to Michael Isaacson, the Cornell professor of applied and
<BR>
engineering physics who is the director of the W.M. Keck Program in
<BR>
Nanobiotechnology at Cornell, scientists and engineers need all the help
<BR>
they can get to seamlessly merge the organic and the inorganic into useful
<BR>
devices.  And so will the entire new field of nanobiotechnology.  His
<BR>
solution is to train what he calls T-shaped individuals.
<BR>
<P>&quot;T-shaped scientists are educated at great depth in one field -
<BR>
electrophysiology, for example - but they also have an interdisciplinary
<BR>
reach in at least two other directions - such as biochemistry and
<BR>
nanotechnology,&quot; Isaacson explains.  In academic terms, this means that
<BR>
Ph.D. students who are Keck Fellows will major and minor in two distinct
<BR>
disciplines, one from the physical sciences or engineering and the other in
<BR>
the biological sciences, and their Ph.D. committee members will come from
<BR>
distinct fields as well.
<BR>
<P>&quot;And Keck Fellows will be trained in communication - with others in their
<BR>
specialties, with scientists outside their fields and with the general
<BR>
public,&quot; Isaacson says.  &quot;In the real world, one spends 10 percent of the
<BR>
time actually doing engineering and 90 percent of the time communicating -
<BR>
about what you and others have done, what you're trying to do now and what
<BR>
you hope to do.  Communication is hard enough in the language of your
<BR>
discipline.  These new scientists will be crossing boundaries all the time,
<BR>
and we need to know what they're talking about.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Some of the nanobiotechnology research-and-teaching venues already exist at
<BR>
the university, such as the College of Engineering's Cornell
<BR>
Nanofabrication Facility, but the best are yet to come with Duffield Hall,
<BR>
planned for completion on the Cornell campus in 2003. The state-of-the-art
<BR>
facility will include characterization and fabrication laboratories, to be
<BR>
equipped, in part, with funds from the Keck program.
<BR>
<P>Characterization labs will be used to study living systems &quot;the way nature
<BR>
made them, to see if  we're doing it right,&quot; Isaacson explains.  And
<BR>
separate fabrication laboratories are necessary, he notes, because
<BR>
nanobiotechnology involves many more materials than pure silicon, the
<BR>
traditional medium for integrated circuitry.  &quot;In silicon-based
<BR>
fabrication, some of the materials in biological systems, sodium for
<BR>
example, are contaminants and would not be allowed in the same building,&quot;
<BR>
Isaacson says.  &quot;Nanobiotechnology research may involve sodium and lots
<BR>
more, and our fabrication laboratory facilities will be specially designed
<BR>
to take that complexity into account.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&quot;We're not trying to disband the traditional academic specialties,&quot; says
<BR>
Isaacson.  &quot;In the academic world, specialized disciplines will always be
<BR>
the best environment to create new knowledge. But nanobiotechnologists will
<BR>
need the best education from several different disciplines.
<BR>
<P>&quot;And at Cornell, they will get that education by freely crossing boundaries
<BR>
and learning the principles, the skills and the languages of all the
<BR>
sciences they need to make living systems and engineered systems work hand
<BR>
in hand - or rather, molecule to molecule.&quot;
