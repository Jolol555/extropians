&quot;I grew up in a small village in Tasmania. Everything that we needed we
<BR>
made. We made our own boots, our own metal works; we caught fish, grew food,
<BR>
made bread. I didn't know anybody who lived there who had only one job, or
<BR>
even anything that you could define as a job. Everybody worked at several
<BR>
things.
<BR>
<P>Until I was about 28, I lived in a sort of dream. I spent most of my time in
<BR>
the bush or on the sea. I fished, I hunted for my living. It wasn't until
<BR>
the 1950s that I noticed large parts of the system in which I lived were
<BR>
disappearing. Fish stocks started to collapse. Seaweed around the shorelines
<BR>
had thinned out. Large patches of the forest began to die. I hadn't realized
<BR>
until then that I had become very fond of them, that I was in love with my
<BR>
country.
<BR>
<P>After many years as a scientist with the Wildlife Survey and the Tasmanian
<BR>
Inland Fisheries Department, I began to protest against the political and
<BR>
industrial systems I saw were killing us and the world around us. But I soon
<BR>
decided that it was no good persisting with opposition that in the end
<BR>
achieved nothing. I withdrew from society for two years; I did not want to
<BR>
oppose anything ever again and waste my time. I wanted to come back only
<BR>
with something positive, something that would allow us all to exist without
<BR>
the wholesale collapse of biological systems.
<BR>
<P>In 1968, I began teaching at the University of Tasmania, and in 1974, David
<BR>
Holmgren and I jointly evolved a framework for a sustainable agricultural
<BR>
system based on a multi-crop of perennial trees, shrubs, herbs (vegetables
<BR>
and weeds), fungi, and root systems, for which I coined the word
<BR>
&quot;permaculture&quot;. We spent a lot of time working out the principles of
<BR>
permaculture and building a species-rich garden. This culminated in the
<BR>
publication of the Permaculture books.
<BR>
<P>Public reaction to permaculture was mixed. The professional community was
<BR>
outraged, because we were combining architecture with biology, agriculture
<BR>
with forestry, and forestry with animal husbandry, so that almost everybody
<BR>
who considered themselves to be a specialist felt a bit offended. But the
<BR>
popular response was very different. Many people had been thinking along the
<BR>
same lines. They were dissatisfied with agriculture as it is now practised,
<BR>
and were looking towards more natural, ecological systems.
