<P><EM>&gt; Interesting what one would consider 'magic physics' and what one considers 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; within the realm of coherent probability?  Many people, yes even scholars 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; educated in physics, astronomy, biology, and computer science; would, sadly, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be very scornful of this entire mailing list and the subjects that govern it. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps some guidence might be in order for levels of acceptability on what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; falls into the realm of reality and what is beyond the pale? Are multiple 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universes magic physics or non-locality? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Mitch, from my perspective, anything that is outside the realm of
<BR>
what we can **construct** as engineers (software or hardware) *today*
<BR>
or in the *near term* future (because it does not violate laws of physics
<BR>
and is clearly on the path of current engineering technology) 
<BR>
*is* magic physics.
<BR>
<P>Time travel, multiverses, quantum computers are *all* in the realm
<BR>
of magic physics from my perspective.  Given our current understanding,
<BR>
the probability that they could be &quot;managed&quot; by us is highly
<BR>
doubtful.  On the other hand if they do become &quot;manageable&quot;
<BR>
they probably increase the likelyhood that we are all running
<BR>
on a simulation.
<BR>
<P>Please beware that I do not discount the possibility that your
<BR>
hopes and desires *may* be correct.  But I draw the line between
<BR>
what we *can* or *are likely to* do, and what we *cannot* do.  Tipler
<BR>
may be wonderful at inventing new physics, but if he cannot
<BR>
tell us how to make it useful for our lives in the next 10-20
<BR>
years, then it is irrelevant from my perspective.
<BR>
<P>Moravec on the other hand seems to have two possible perspectives --
<BR>
the humans are doomed because the robots are superior or the obsolete
<BR>
humans will be supported by taxes on sentient but controlled robots
<BR>
(e.g. salves).  Both of which I find highly undesirable.
