<EM>&gt; &gt; LM has its own commercial imaging satellites.  We need not buy

<EM>&gt; Ooooppppssss, Spike, you mean the Cubans and North Korean's I presume...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suppose you could consider China communist, but that rope is slipping.
</EM><BR>
<P>Haar.  Actually I use the term commies to refer to the Russians, even
<BR>
tho I dont use the term to refer to those who really are still communist.
<BR>
Its kind of a little inside joke for those of us who are thankful to have
<BR>
survived the cold war.  {8-]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps Steve Martin's &quot;Wild N Crazy Guy&quot; has taken possession of Spike?!?
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I mean, who is the only person on the list who has actually been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*trying* to attach little cameras to little aircraft? You gotta wonder.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now that ya mention it...  I think we might be better off using that
<BR>
flybot which nature has provided, so back to the sphex wasp.  The
<BR>
wearable computer crowd has reported that the military researchers
<BR>
have managed to create LCD arrays with pixels 10 microns on a side.
<BR>
So now instead of steering your bug with deployable control surfaces,
<BR>
we will make a littel bug helmet of sorts, or blinders with about a 100x100
<BR>
array of LCD pixels, a millimeter on a side.  Then to turn left, one
<BR>
sends an image of a sparrow to the right array, bug turns away from
<BR>
the image, left.  To make her fly up, fake in an image of the
<BR>
bird below, etc.  Steer the little sucker that way.
<BR>
<P>The sphex has been shown to be able to carry 1 gram grubs and
<BR>
caterpillars over a reasonable distance, so now all we gotta do
<BR>
is fit them with super-small its-a-virtual-bugs-life helmets, super light
<BR>
imaging cameras and we can take all the pictures that we want
<BR>
of the commies.  spike
