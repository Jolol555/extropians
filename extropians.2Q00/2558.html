<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;With the speech recognition and synthesis software in its *current* state,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which is not perfect but pretty good, it is clear that there is no longer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any need for people to learn languages. Rather they will buy them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, this idea misses something that I think is an important aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to learning a language: learning the culture.  Embedded in the language are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousands of nuances that describe a culture of people.
</EM><BR>
<P>After thinking this over, I can do better than the previous post
<BR>
in which I suggested every language could derive a subset of
<BR>
itself which conforms to a few universal rules.  Part of that still
<BR>
would apply, but consider Orwell's Newspeak.
<BR>
<P>Of course Orwell was using the concept to make a profound
<BR>
point:  Newspeak was invented to prevent thought-crime, since
<BR>
there would eventually be no words to describe illegal memes.
<BR>
<P>Allow me to suggest an Orwellian-inspired international
<BR>
language, and temporarily refer to it as spikespeak.  I
<BR>
acknowlege that it would be useless for understanding or
<BR>
even expressing cultural values, poetry, songs, seducing
<BR>
one's lover, etc, but it would be completely translatable.
<BR>
<P>The structure of spikespeak would be such that all words
<BR>
would map down to and back up from a universal interface.
<BR>
Using Orwell's example of the word &quot;good&quot;.  What need is
<BR>
there for the word &quot;bad&quot; when -good or ungood is the same.
<BR>
Orwell suggests plusgood and doubleplusgood etc, to
<BR>
express excellent, splendid, etc.
<BR>
<P>In spikespeak, all adjectives with shades of meaning &quot;good&quot;
<BR>
would be mapped onto a scale between 0 and 31.  So
<BR>
good:16 is more good than good:12, for instance.  Excellent
<BR>
becomes good:20, ultimate good = good:31.  Of course
<BR>
all the bad stuff is simply negative, so &quot;terrible&quot; might become
<BR>
good:-25.
<BR>
<P>Then we list all our adjectives in order and assign them
<BR>
numbers.  These translate down into a spikespeak interface
<BR>
which then can be translated back up into any language where
<BR>
others are playing the game too.
<BR>
<P>As before, spikespeak itself is not the language, its the interface
<BR>
between languages.  People would not use it or write in it,
<BR>
certainly not for interpersonal relationships, for it would not
<BR>
work at all:
<BR>
<P>Person female:31, you are good:31.  Eyes belonging to person
<BR>
you are appearance:good:31.  Hair belonging to person you is
<BR>
texture:good:26...
<BR>
<P>Might translate up into My lady, your eyes are beautiful and
<BR>
your hair is like silk....
<BR>
<P>And so on.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think that it is an impossible task,
</EM><BR>
<P>Or a very difficult one but possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and furthermore, why would one want to?  (I wouldn't)
</EM><BR>
<P>I want to.  {8-]  spike
