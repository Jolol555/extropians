<P>HEADLINE: VIOLENT OPPOSITION TO GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS IN EUROPE
<BR>
<P>ANCHORS: LIANE HANSEN
<BR>
<P>REPORTERS: SYLVIA POGGIOLI
<BR>
<P>BODY:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIANE HANSEN, host:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few issues have raised grassroots passion in Europe as much as what is 
<BR>
known
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as genetically modified food.  Much to the annoyance of American 
<BR>
agribusiness,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the European Union requires labelling on any food with more than 1 percent 
<BR>
of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;genetically modified ingredients.  There are strong differences in 
<BR>
the ways that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans and Europeans regard food, and that's the topic in our continuing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;conversations about Europe with NPR's Sylvia Poggioli.  Today, she 
<BR>
joins us from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rome.  Hi, Sylvia.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SYLVIA POGGIOLI reporting:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, Liane.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HANSEN: This is a very intense food fight that's going on.  I mean, last
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;week, you had environmentalists going mano a mano with the police in 
<BR>
Genoa at a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;biotechnology conference.  And we've heard about McDonald's in France being
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;trashed.  This is very serious, isn't it?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POGGIOLI: This is no joke.  You know, the food issue has become kind of a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rallying cry across Europe.  The British press calls genetically modified 
<BR>
food
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or GM food, 'Frankenfood' or mutant food.  I won't even tell you 
<BR>
what the French
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Italian press say about American companies trying to tell 
<BR>
Europeans what
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to eat.  You know, really seriously, European rejection of what--these are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;called GM crops, it's rooted in food scares, such as the mad cow disease in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain and the dioxin-tainted chickens in Belgium.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are other factors that have turned this into a kind of, you 
<BR>
know,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;battle of ideology and culture.  Deep down, Europeans do not share 
<BR>
Americans'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;trust in science and technology.  Now you often hear Americans accusing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Europeans of being hypochondriac about technological progress in the food
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;industry, and for their part, the Europeans see Americans as 
<BR>
manipulating food.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They kind of see them as the sorcerer's apprentice or, you know, the 
<BR>
witches in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Macbeth&quot; sort of cackling over their boiling cauldron.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HANSEN: I'm afraid this doesn't sound very rational at all.  This 
<BR>
sounds very
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;over the top.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POGGIOLI: The tone has gotten very strident at times, and even sounds 
<BR>
like a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;religious war.  But we got to remember that food is really a crucial 
<BR>
element for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Europeans in their cultural and national identity. Eating is a really 
<BR>
serious,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sit-down ritual here.  You're not going to see Europeans eating on the 
<BR>
street,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;on the go, at their work desks or out of packages and boxes. Those American,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;quintessentially American concepts, of hyperconvenience foods and dashboard
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dining are heretical over here.  Don't forget, Europeans have a different
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;relationship with nature.  It's closer to them.  It's less menacing for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Europeans than for Americans, who, you know, had to conquer the 
<BR>
frontier. Farms
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are still mainly family run.  They eat the same recipes that their parents,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;their grandparents and great-grandparents ate.  So you've got this sense of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;continuity.  It's very strong.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Italy, for instance, you've got olive trees that are several 
<BR>
hundred years
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;old.  They're still producing olives.  So this connection between the food 
<BR>
and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the land that produces it, it's so strong that some of the best and most
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;celebrated restaurants are not in cities, but in small, off the beaten track
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;villages in rural areas.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HANSEN: But is this just in Italy, which is known for the quality of its
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;food, or France, say, which is also known for the quality of its 
<BR>
food? Or is it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;widespread throughout Europe?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POGGIOLI: It's pretty widespread.  For instance, the anti-genetically
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;modified movement is very strong in Britain, which is definitely not known 
<BR>
for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;its great cuisine.  Supermarkets in Britain are said to be the institution
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that's most trusted by Brits, so when the supermarkets last year competed in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;declaring themselves GM-free, the agribusinesses had definitely lost 
<BR>
the battle
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the aisles.  So it's not surprising that according to a European 
<BR>
Commission
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;poll, Europeans are more likely than Americans--and I quote from what they
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;said--&quot;to view agricultural biotechnology as a threat to the moral order and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;more likely to associate biotech foods with menacing images of adulteration,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;infection and monsters.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HANSEN: Is this all about science, though, or is it more culture?  It 
<BR>
seems
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;very just anti-American.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POGGIOLI: There's a lot of anti-Americanism.  That feeling has 
<BR>
been latent in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the European psyche for a long time.  And now as the average European sort 
<BR>
of,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you know, looks around, sees all this Americanization, the dominance 
<BR>
of American
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;movies, of music, the Internet, their baseball caps everywhere, and now
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fast-food outlets, there's a sense of creeping American colonialism.  And 
<BR>
it's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;strengthening what the Europeans now call American culinary imperialism. 
<BR>
And I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;think you can recognize that's the language of the old European left. It's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fascinating to see how the old, you know, '68 generation of lefties and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;political activists has transformed itself in middle age into food 
<BR>
militants.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they've dived into the culinary trenches of what they see as the last 
<BR>
kind
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of battlefield against American cultural encroachment.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the most important of these trenches is the Slow Food Movement. You've
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;probably heard about it.  There's several chapters in the United States. 
<BR>
Well,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it was founded by Italian leftists as a means to protect local culinary
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;patrimonies and endangered recipes.  The slow food militants, they call
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves the Gastronomic left(ph), or the Greenpeace of Gastronomy.  And 
<BR>
one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of their slogans is, 'Reject Sheep,' which what they mean there is 
<BR>
manipulated
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;food.  They say material and moral pleasures are not free.  The century of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;egalitarian utopias has been buried forever under the well-stocked table.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HANSEN: My.  Well, you know, a lot of Americans are coming to Europe this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;summer.  You know, many of them coming to Rome.  What should they expect?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POGGIOLI: Well, I think this is really, Liane, the place to issue a formal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;warning to Americans coming to Europe.  I've seen many Americans at Italian
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;restaurants, after taking a bite from a regular mixed salad, I've heard them
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;exclaim in shock, 'This tomato is too intense.' So beware, everybody, 
<BR>
Italian
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tomatoes can be a stimulant for American tastebuds.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HANSEN: NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Rome.  She'll be joining us frequently to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;talk about her Europe.  Thanks a lot, Sylvia.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POGGIOLI: Thank you, Liane.
