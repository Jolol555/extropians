<P>
&quot;... and we thank Reverend Stewart Thundran for explaining why the
<BR>
Bible shows blacks, asians and liberals to be inferior to us. Our next guest 
<BR>
here at the Annual Racist Conference is Herr Doctor Wilhelm Zuckermann from 
<BR>
the Transhuman Research Institute. Welcome, Herr Doctor!&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Thank you. It is a pleasure to be here among similar-minded
<BR>
people. My research clearly shows the superiority of the white race on many 
<BR>
measures: intelligence, certain aspects of physical stamina, personality 
<BR>
factors and overall attractiveness.&quot;
<BR>
<P>[Shows diagrams, the audience cheers]
<BR>
<P>&quot;However, we decided to find out what aspects of these factors were
<BR>
genetic and cultural. We undertook a international study, where we did both 
<BR>
a genome and cultural factor analysis. Eventually we arrived at this:&quot;
<BR>
<P>[Huge, complicated diagram]
<BR>
<P>&quot;In short, we can see here the genetic basis for most of the inferior
<BR>
traits, and how the different alleles among most whites makes us better.
<BR>
<P>We then went on to investigate what to do about it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>[cheers from the audience]
<BR>
<P>&quot;While genetic therapy on adults is still not good enough, we think
<BR>
that gene therapy on the embryo stage might work. And germline engineering 
<BR>
certainly will. With the right viral vectors we can cure inferior races of 
<BR>
their genetic problems.&quot;
<BR>
<P>[the audience starts to look stunned]
<BR>
<P>&quot;In our experiments in animal models, we have found that it is indeed
<BR>
possible to use 'coctail viruses' to introduce the right antisense 
<BR>
inhibitors and express new alleles to make an inferior strain not just 
<BR>
normal, but actually to *enhance* it.
<BR>
<P>It turned out that since there are also alleles with positive effects even 
<BR>
in a strain that is overall somewhat weaker than the normal strain. So when 
<BR>
all the bad genes were fixed, the overall effect was that it became better 
<BR>
than the normal strain&quot;
<BR>
<P>[some members of the audience begin to look worried]
<BR>
<P>&quot;Using the technologies we have developed, it will not just become
<BR>
possible to cure blacks, asians and liberals, but to make them into superior 
<BR>
races.&quot;
<BR>
<P>[stunned silence, then pandemonium. Herr Doctor raises the volume of his 
<BR>
microphone and continues unfazed.]
<BR>
<P>&quot;I see you realize the wonderful possibilities too. Of course, not
<BR>
everything is genetic and there are cultural influences that are just as 
<BR>
important as genes. With increasing standards of living and education, we 
<BR>
can expect many of factors such as IQ differences to even out. But there are 
<BR>
other cultural factors that have negative effects on people, and we have set 
<BR>
up an applied memetics study group to develop the means to modify culture to 
<BR>
fix the cultural deficiencies of inferior cultures without losing the 
<BR>
positive elements of them; we fully expect a similar superiority effect to 
<BR>
occur.&quot;
<BR>
<P>[Herr Doctor notices a screaming Clan member]
<BR>
<P>&quot;But what about *us*?!!&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;Oh, isn't that obvious. We use the same technology to improve our
<BR>
defective genes and memes. Just as an example, given the ozon hole, it is 
<BR>
obvious that black skin is a big advantage we better get too. Not to mention 
<BR>
get rid off a lot of stupid memes like monotheism.
<BR>
<P>In the long run as everybody optimizes themselves with only the best genes 
<BR>
and memes, of course, the end result will be just one superior race. Any new 
<BR>
races after that will simply be different design choices. Isn't that great?&quot;
<BR>
<P><PRE>
