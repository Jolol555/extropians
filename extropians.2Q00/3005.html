</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         I'm not sure I completely understand where you are coming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from.  Could you help me out a bit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; One, you're humans, and suffering is wrong; two, you're humans who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tend to be important to the Singularity, and suffering might detract
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from that; three, I care about you, too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         When you say suffering is wrong do you mean it is wrong that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sasha died, or wrong for us to suffer over his death?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Are you saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we shouldn't be talking about sasha's death, but instead should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be working to bring about the singularity...?
</EM><BR>
<P>Would &quot;not talking about it&quot; decrease your suffering?  I thought not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Even so, the decrease in pain and suffering that might result from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; signing up for cryonics is not as great as the decrease in pain and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suffering that could be brought about by helping the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Singularitarians who remain, or (since I haven't, in fact, signed up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for insurance) brought about by spending my money on Singularitarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; efforts now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Tell me if I have this right.  Are you saying that instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spending $120K on cryonic preservation we should donate that $120K to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer R&amp;D or something that would bring the singularity here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faster?
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;We&quot;?  What's this &quot;we&quot;?  What's this unstoppable semantic leap between
<BR>
&quot;I choose X&quot; and &quot;you should choose X&quot;?  I, personally, would rather
<BR>
spend money on seed AI, and I, personally, would rather spend my money
<BR>
now than take out an insurance policy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It's just that, at least in theory, my life is not intrinsically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; worth more than anyone else's, and is therefore a vanishing quantity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in any equation which refers to six billion people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Some day I hope to be like a God that can be very intimate with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trillions of people and more all at the same time.  Some day I hope to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel more pain and suffering if one of those trillions dies, than I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know when one of the 100 or so extropians I know dies.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; singularity or when we start approaching the infinite it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly amplify, not diminish the importance of 1 in 6 billion will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it not?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I will confess to the extremely immodest but factually correct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; belief that my actions now have a significant probability of saving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; billions of lives, which provides a utilitarian justification for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; socially acceptable forms of selfishness such as not shipping all my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; money to starving Freedonia or whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Hmmm, I think I almost understand this.  So you are saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the $120K spent on cryonic preservation could be instead spent on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something that has the possibility of saving billions of lives right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If so this makes some sens and I must admit it is a good point.  So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you are saying you're going to give up your chance at eternal life,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forgo cryonic suspension, with the hope that doing so will save 6
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; billion others?  I guess if it even had a reasonable chance of saving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 20 or 30 of our children you'd be a real hero I'd think.  If so, what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is it you're working on or pushing for that might accomplish such?
</EM><BR>
<P>Right now?  &quot;Coding a Transhuman AI&quot; version 2.0 alpha.
<BR>
<P>And no, I don't want to be a hero.  I think it loses some of the whole
<BR>
point if you're a hero.  I'm not making a permanent moral commitment
<BR>
which, if abandoned or altered, would mean that I'd betrayed everything
<BR>
a Singularitarian should stand for.  Once you become a hero, then PR
<BR>
forces you to never re-evaluate your own choices.  And there's also a
<BR>
sort of gloating involved, where, even if you *say* you refuse to
<BR>
comment on the choices of others - well, obviously, they're still
<BR>
*wrong*, right?  Even if you're too *wise* and *tolerant* to call anyone
<BR>
else on it?
<BR>
<P>What I want to do is say that I'm making a particular decision using a
<BR>
particular type of logic, in total freedom from the usual social
<BR>
implications that would be attached to altruism.  Alas, even here, it's
<BR>
not easy to do so.
