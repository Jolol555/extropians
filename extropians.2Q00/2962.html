<P>
<EM>&gt; Think of it as a client, or interface, into the microprocessor's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;human&quot; API.  The point is not to augment the brain to be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handle computer instructions, but rather to augment it for more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efficiect bidirectional communication with the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aforementioned computer(s).
</EM><BR>
<P>The idea of brain augmentation via computer is something that has 
<BR>
interested me since I was a teenager. Beyond the practical issue 
<BR>
of how to achieve such a brain/computer interface, I'm curious 
<BR>
what applications the members of this list might imagine for such 
<BR>
a device.
<BR>
<P>Despite the time I've spent speculating about this, I can't help 
<BR>
feeling that my ideas about it are really pretty short sighted, 
<BR>
really just improvements of the same things we do now, and that 
<BR>
the real &quot;killer apps&quot; will be much harder to predict.
<BR>
<P>Here are some ideas that come to mind:
<BR>
<P>A &quot;math coprocessor&quot; for the brain.
<BR>
<P>An accurate data storage system that, while probably not as 
<BR>
extensively cross-linked as biological memory, would have the 
<BR>
advantage of not being subject to the well known distortions of 
<BR>
biological memory. Combining the brain's remarkable ability to 
<BR>
find connections between events (for example, remembering an 
<BR>
event that happened around the same time as another one, or an 
<BR>
event that involved the same people, or the same location, or 
<BR>
similar outcome, etc.), with the ability to then retrieve an 
<BR>
accurate record, would be a very useful capability. This might 
<BR>
work something like a minidisc recorder, with a relatively small 
<BR>
buffer that records sensory input continually, committing the 
<BR>
data to the larger long-term storage only when you make a 
<BR>
conscious decision to do so. This way you can capture the event 
<BR>
that triggered the decision to record, as long as it is recent 
<BR>
enough to still be in the short term buffer. &quot;Making a mental 
<BR>
note&quot; would become much more trustworthy. And hopefully such 
<BR>
ability might inspire a shift in education, away from acquiring a 
<BR>
collection of facts and methods, focusing instead on why the 
<BR>
methods work, how the facts became known, and how to generalize 
<BR>
this understanding in order to solve new problems.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Telepathic&quot; communication, by very practical, reliable, and 
<BR>
purely non-mystical means.
<BR>
<P>Interface to artificial sense organs, such as IR cameras, radio 
<BR>
receivers, xray detectors, etc.
<BR>
<P>GPS positioning, so you always know where you are (at least when 
<BR>
on earth). You could then navigate better than gueese flying 
<BR>
south for the winter, with no external equipment.
<BR>
<P>A constantly running &quot;backup&quot; of the brain's state, for emergency 
<BR>
uploading purposes. So you could survive events that telomere 
<BR>
repair or other longevity methods cannot save you from, like 
<BR>
plane crashes or skiing accidents.
<BR>
<P>Hmm.. These would be great to have, but surely there must be 
<BR>
other, more profound applications.  Any ideas?
<BR>

<P>The future is ours to create.
