<EM>&gt; What it seems to come down to is: do you think extropianism is what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is defined by Max with his principles, or do you think what really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matters is each person's own definition?
</EM><BR>
<P>Since Max's definition seems to set forth quite clearly that the
<BR>
Principles are not intended to be final, nor are they intended to be
<BR>
rules (and furthermore, they are directly opposed to arbitrary rules and
<BR>
dogma), these two answers are not currently different.
<BR>
<P>However, whether the Principles document (bearing in mind future
<BR>
versions) should be considered the definition (i.e, that he and ExI hold
<BR>
exclusive rights to the meaning of the word) remains a question to be
<BR>
answered.
<BR>
<P>I am reminded here of the long argument over use of the word &quot;hacker&quot;. I
<BR>
know for sure that if I were to bring that up here and defend my side of
<BR>
it, I would be told that usage has changed, there is nothing one can do,
<BR>
shit happens, get over it, by at least two of you.
<BR>
<P>Consider this parallel carefully when discussing use of 'extropy' and
<BR>
its derivatives. The same *will* happen, I assure you.
<BR>
<P>And if you're not familiar with that particular debate, 'communist' will
<BR>
do just as well.
