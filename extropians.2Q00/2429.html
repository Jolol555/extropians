<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;Surveillance has *nothing* to do with freedom.  You are free now to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;anything that is legal.  You would have that exact same freedom in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;completely transparent society.  Your only loss of freedom would be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;freedom to commit a crime and get away with it.  If you have a problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;with giving that up, I think that says more about you than it says about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The problem is the definition of &quot;crime&quot;. When any action that has no harm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to another person is labeled a &quot;crime&quot;, then surveillance becomes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;tyrannical. We can look forward (for example) to smokers being fined by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;mail, and as was stated earlier, a final breakdown of the &quot;innocent until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;proven guilty&quot; principle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Its not that I don't believe there are such things as victimless crimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (sodomy between consenting adults comes to mind), but when you think about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ultimate effect of many so-called victimless crimes, you begin to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that society itself is the victim many times.
</EM><BR>
<P>Such arguments are utter BS that only look at one side of the argument,
<BR>
much like the current claims of health care costs from gun crimes, when
<BR>
Prof. John Lotts study proves that gun ownership reduces gun crimes,
<BR>
therefore reducing gun crime related health care costs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For instance, taking your example of smoking.  No one is harmed by the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you smoke cigarettes, right?  Well, even putting aside the obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem of second hand smoke, what happens when you come down with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emphysema?  On the off hand chance that you have sufficient private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insurance (or money) to cover your own medical care, then the only victims
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (besides your own stupid self) are those who care about you and suffer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seeing you suffering to death.
</EM><BR>
<P>its been proven quite well by the Veterans Administration studying the
<BR>
health care costs of smoking and nonsmoking veterans over their adult
<BR>
lives in service and retired that smoking REDUCES total medical
<BR>
expenditures.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the more likely scenario where some form of public insurance is needed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supplement your medical care, the victims of your &quot;victimless&quot; crime are (1)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you, (2) those who care about you, and (3) taxpayers like me who are paying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for your expensive medical care.
</EM><BR>
<P>How does my family financially suffer from my death? The only group that
<BR>
pays is the life insurance industry, and if they haven't satisfactorily
<BR>
accounted for my smoking, then they deserve to take the loss. My family
<BR>
deserves NO money from me, get it? Where does it say I am obligated to
<BR>
let them inherit anything? Where does it say they have to contribute to
<BR>
my health care costs when they didn't make any contributions to
<BR>
attempting to help me stop smoking? 
<BR>
<P>For the record, I don't smoke.
