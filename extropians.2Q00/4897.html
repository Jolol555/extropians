<P><EM>    &gt;the last two THAAD missile firings, both successful.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd be very skeptical of the military's claim of success.  The main problem
<BR>
has always been distinguishing the warhead from the cloud of decoys that
<BR>
would certainly be there. A few years ago they claimed to have solved the
<BR>
problem and had a successful test, but much later it turned out that they'd
<BR>
installed a electric heater on the mock warhead so it gave off a much
<BR>
stronger infrared signal. The latest round of testing is no more honest a inside
<BR>
informant told the New York Times on Friday. With realistic decoys the
<BR>
system had absolutely no luck finding the warhead so they just dumbed down the
<BR>
testing. First they reduced the number of decoys, it didn't help, then they tried to
<BR>
make sure the radar signal of the decoys was either much greater or much less
<BR>
than the decoys and that did help, but not enough. Finely they made sure all decoys
<BR>
were highly polished and perfectly spherical so their radar signature wouldn't
<BR>
change, the mock warhead was cone shaped and as it tumbled the radar signal
<BR>
flashed and made it very easy to spot.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; You may have heard by now about how the national missile defense
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; is all a big reaganesque fantasy, etc.  I was just wondering if anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; here has any strong opinions in this regard.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it's a screwy idea. It would never work against a massive attack because
<BR>
defense will always be more expensive than offence, if it takes 10 dollars to
<BR>
shoot down 10 cents of hardware the other side will just overwhelm you. As for a
<BR>
small attack, well if I were an insane dictator of some little jerkwater country I wouldn't
<BR>
use ICBM's to deliver my bombs, they're harder to make than nukes and much more
<BR>
expensive; I'd use FedEx or UPS to deliver my H Bomb, the transportation would only
<BR>
cost a few dollars not a few billion. It has other advantages too, a rocket can be tracked
<BR>
so everyone would know who was responsible for having Manhattan vaporized,
<BR>
America might be irritated at me. Better if things just go boom and nobody knows why.
<BR>
I could even send a letter of condolence afterwards.
