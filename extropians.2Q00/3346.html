<EM>&gt; associated with lower suicide risk?
</EM><BR>
<P>I suspect that there is a huge amount of self-medication for low mood
<BR>
and outright despair using caffeine and nicotine and alcohol.  The
<BR>
hideous thing about alcohol is that it actually works quickly to
<BR>
reduce the psychic pain of depression, but it pushes your
<BR>
biochemistry significantly further toward the depressed mode over
<BR>
time.   
<BR>
<P>The antidepressant discussion has yanked me out of my normal lurk mode.
<BR>
Antidepressants are very interesting in Extropian terms--basically
<BR>
they are a primitive form of self-modification, and all the issues
<BR>
about modifying oneself show up in one way or another in the
<BR>
antidepressant arena, starting with the fact that many, if not most,
<BR>
people are threatened by those of us who want to modify ourselves,
<BR>
and want to be able to control or restrict this.  And just try to
<BR>
tell a psychiatrist that *you* are in control of your treatment.
<BR>
<P>There's an interesting argument made by Peter Breggin in &quot;Talking
<BR>
Back to Prozac&quot; about antidepressants and stimulants.  The history of
<BR>
new antidepressant drugs is one of initial enthusiasm for each
<BR>
innovation, but an eventual realization that new drug X is basically
<BR>
a stimulant.  &quot;Talking Back&quot; is an anti-Prozac tract, but it has a
<BR>
number of interesting and thought-provoking nuggets like this.
<BR>
The reason that stimulants are not ultimately successful as
<BR>
antidepressants is that the body is very good at building tolerance
<BR>
to stimulants.   Our homeostatic mechanisms recognize the state of
<BR>
being overstimulated and clamp down pretty quickly.
<BR>
<P>The stimulant analogy connects for me to the &quot;Prozac poop-out effect&quot;
<BR>
that many people experience at around seven years on SSRIs.  
<BR>
Seemingly SSRIs are hard for the body's homeostatic mechanisms to
<BR>
work around.  Maybe it even takes seven years.  Which would make a
<BR>
heck of a lot of sense because the speculated mechanism whereby you
<BR>
develop a tolerance for SSRIs is that you actually prune connections,
<BR>
losing synapses to get the data rates (where?) back to where they
<BR>
want to be.  Scary stuff.  There just aren't any long term studies. 
<BR>
Exactly how bad do the drug companies want to prove that you lose
<BR>
synapses?   I was pretty worried about being expected to be a good
<BR>
sheep and take high doses of SSRIs as permanent maintenance for life.
<BR>
<P>The best reading on the philosophical issues surrounding SSRIs is
<BR>
&quot;Listening to Prozac&quot; by Peter Kramer.  &quot;Listening&quot; is for the
<BR>
most part a pro-side rant, but Kramer actually covers more of the
<BR>
research history than Breggin, and the research history is pretty
<BR>
damning in terms of circular reasoning.  
<BR>
<P>Speaking from too much personal experience, it is deeply weird to have
<BR>
your subjective outlook turned around by a pill or the act of
<BR>
stopping the pills.  I once went cold-turkey from high doses of
<BR>
Prozac and watched the world get colder, darker, dirtier, and uglier
<BR>
by the hour over a handful of days while I was fully aware that no
<BR>
such thing was actually happening external to me.  And that ugliness
<BR>
projected on the world made me feel very bad.  Incredibly strange.
<BR>
<P>I think that you can push the brain around with strong drugs, but
<BR>
they aren't the answer for life, partly because of tolerance
<BR>
development, but also because there's no learning in a drug, and
<BR>
depression appears to be a learned thing, which has serious
<BR>
biochemical effects on you, but those effects aren't the cause.
<BR>
My theory is that the brain chemistry changes are how the evolved
<BR>
depression mechanism gets its results.  My thinking is that
<BR>
depression is a mechanism designed to allow an individual to survive
<BR>
and possibly get a chance to reproduce, given serious low-status, low
<BR>
pecking-order in our ancestral tribal environment.  Some of us fall
<BR>
into the depressed mode more easily, but everyone has the potential
<BR>
to get there if pushed hard enough and long enough.
<BR>
<P>I guess that my take on drugs is that they are good for intervention
<BR>
but not for maintenance, which is exactly opposite to the
<BR>
current clinical approach.
<BR>
<P>My experience is that &quot;attack&quot; dosages of 2 to 3X the max spec'd
<BR>
dosage of SSRIs can significantly impact acute despair in 4 to 8
<BR>
hours, but I'm not a doctor and that's playing with fire.  This
<BR>
personal experience of mine has never been confirmed in another
<BR>
person, so I could very well be off base here.  I'd really like to
<BR>
see research on this, though, because it would be nice to have a
<BR>
powerful tool to pull people back from the brink.
<BR>
<P>St. John's Wort, an herb available as capsules at most any health
<BR>
food store, has significant SSRI effects.   For some reason, that
<BR>
fact doesn't seem to get into press much.  Even the people who make
<BR>
the capsules tout the mood benefits, but not the Prozac connection.
<BR>
I like the fact that you don't have to deal with the AMA and the
<BR>
prescription drug establishment to gain access to the current state
<BR>
of the art in antidepressants.  If you are going to self medicate,
<BR>
read both &quot;Listening to...&quot; and &quot;Talking Back to....&quot; cited above, as
<BR>
well as anything else you can get your hands on.  Playing with your
<BR>
neurotransmitters is risky, and far from an exact science.
<BR>
<P>Oh, one parting note about SSRI's (or any effective antidepressant,
<BR>
actually) and suicide or violence.   Take someone who is essentially
<BR>
completely disabled by depression.  Stimulate the heck out of some of
<BR>
their neural pathways with a drug.  They aren't collapsed on the
<BR>
couch anymore.  They actually could carry out suicide plans that were
<BR>
probably beyond them in the totally depressed state.  The same goes
<BR>
for taking action against someone else.  I've not read anything about
<BR>
this, but I have spoken to several clinicians who regard this as a
<BR>
significant risk of SSRIs, and give it as a reason why they always
<BR>
start patients with low doses.
