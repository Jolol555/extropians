<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Windows is not incapable of priviledge levels or access restrictions. It

<EM>&gt; &gt; No, Matt referred to Windows 95, which has *no* system of file
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; permissions whatsoever. Using a Win95/98 system is comparable to having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a Unix system in which everybody logs in as root.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I said, no. That is just the typical consumer installation. However
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone experienced with administering win95/98 machines on a network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that utilizes groups and user logins knows that this is not so.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do happen to be experienced with this, actually. Whilst you can of
<BR>
course set permissions to network resources, the local machine is still
<BR>
vulnerable (there is no ownership/permission information on a VFAT
<BR>
filesystem). The so-called restrictions you can put in place depend on
<BR>
simply removing the user's options to do things in those programs which
<BR>
you can instruct to do so (since this includes the Explorer shell, it
<BR>
*appears* pretty comprehensive - they will be told they cannot run the
<BR>
executable files they try, etc) - but programs, once running, still have
<BR>
full priviledges. Ask any clever schoolkid how they get around the 
<BR>
'security' on the Win95/98 machines at school to run a game - it won't
<BR>
let them run the executable, so they look for an application which they can
<BR>
trick into spawning the program for them. Object Packager used to be a
<BR>
good candidate, just OLE-embed a link to the program in a Word document
<BR>
and double click. Now WinZip is often available - tell it to open an
<BR>
.exe file (a feature it has so it can extract from self-extractors), and
<BR>
it will politely ask you if you wish to execute it.
<BR>
<P>It's all basically an extended version of the Windows 3.1 trick of
<BR>
setting [Restrictions] in PROGMAN.INI to hide the 'File' menu :)
<BR>
<P>Unix systems handle user authentication and permissions at the basic
<BR>
system level, making it impossible to override. NT does the same. But
<BR>
not Win95/98.
