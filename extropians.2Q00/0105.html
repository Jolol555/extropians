<EM>&gt; How far are we today from being able to keep a &quot;naked&quot; brain alive?

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To put it another way...how far away is a true cyborg?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not knowing anything about anything...but it seems to me that brains would be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;relatively&quot; easy to maintain....being made of only one (?) or two kinds of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cells it's nutrient requirements must be simplier than that of a whole 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; body....
</EM><BR>
<P>The nutrient requirements of a whole body are not exactly simple. I was
<BR>
once involved in the preparation of TPN (total parenteral nutrition)
<BR>
bags for patients who were too ill to digest food; TPN is a rich,
<BR>
creamy emulsion that can be perfused through a vein and contains about
<BR>
the minimum necessary to keep you alive -- vitamins, ions, glucose,
<BR>
trilgycerides, and a load of other stuff. It tends to be unstable --
<BR>
use within six hours -- and has to be prepared in a clean room with
<BR>
aseptic technique (you really _don't_ want to inject bacteria into
<BR>
someone on TPN!).
<BR>
<P>At the other end of the cycle, you need a kidney and liver. I suppose a
<BR>
dialysis machine would do instead, but that has its own problems (like,
<BR>
potloads of dialysis fluid being required on an ongoing basis). And the
<BR>
liver problem is more serious; keep recirculating blood through your
<BR>
disembodied brain and it'll poison itself with its own waste metabolites
<BR>
unless you've got a whole bunch of liver cells filtering the crap out of
<BR>
it. The nearest thing to an artificial liver we're likely to see in the
<BR>
next decade will be an external support column with a bunch of hepatocytes
<BR>
(hopefully differentiated from clonal embryonic stem cells) growing in it.
<BR>
<P>Next, you need oxygenation and perfusion and circulation. This is
<BR>
distinctly non-trivial, without a heart and lungs; we have machines to
<BR>
do it in operating theatres, but they tend to knock the hell out of the
<BR>
erythrocytes and need a constant dribble of anticoagulants to keep from
<BR>
clogging up. And then there's haematopoeisis -- all your erythrocytes (red
<BR>
blood cells) die by 14 days, so you need to produce a constant supply of
<BR>
fresh blood. So either you need bone marrow, or your brain is going to
<BR>
be queueing up at the blood bank right behind Dracula.
<BR>
<P>The brain has sod-all immune response. So you need to keep the whole
<BR>
thing in a clean-room environment like unto a chip fab line -- operating
<BR>
theatres are _much_ too dirty for this sort of job.
<BR>
<P>Finally, there's sensory hook-up. We are nowhere near being able to
<BR>
give someone artificial vision (at any level much better than being
<BR>
able to distinguish night from day). Nor do we know how to hook up the
<BR>
various cranial nerves to a vocoder. Your disembodied brain is, in fact,
<BR>
going to be in sensory deprivation hell -- until it succumbs to a passing
<BR>
antibiotic-resistant infection, which will happen sooner rather than later
<BR>
(because of all the crap we're having to ferry in to keep it alive).
<BR>
<P>The best life-support system for a human brain today is still a working
<BR>
human body. And I don't see this situation changing in less than one
<BR>
decade. Without spinal regeneration and full-body cloning, or much better
<BR>
prostheses with working neural control interfaces and sensory feedback, I 
<BR>
can't see any medical demand for the Donovan's Brain treatment. (And I
<BR>
expect those prostheses not to show up -- it's looking right now as if
<BR>
it's a race between bionics and regeneration, and regeneration is
<BR>
winning.)
