<P>
I recently read an interesting book in Swedish. Lars Vargö' s &quot;Leva trångt&quot; 
<BR>
about Japan. There he described his experience with the Yamabushi sect. The 
<BR>
yamabushi is a sect that mixes Shintoism and Buddhism. It is mostly know for 
<BR>
its' strange rituals of fire walking, meditating on nature and climbing up 
<BR>
ladders made of swords. In short it seemed like the usual run of the mill 
<BR>
ascetic oriental cult that Westerner's are so enamoured with. But when he 
<BR>
came to the Yamabushi Center in the north of the island of Honshu he was in 
<BR>
for some surprises. He wasn't lodged in the old 14th century temple complex, 
<BR>
but in a newly built culture center, near the temple complex. He asked why, 
<BR>
and the yamabushi answered him that they otherwise couldn't lodge all the 
<BR>
participants for the one week courses in yamabushi philosophy. He was 
<BR>
surprised that this strict sect accepted that people could try being a 
<BR>
yamabushi- monk &quot;frivolously&quot; for just one week. He got the strange answer 
<BR>
that it was better to be yamabushi for just a week than never in this 
<BR>
lifetime. Grudgingly he tried it on too. Of course he experienced all the 
<BR>
walks in the forest nearby, the meditations and all the other things he 
<BR>
expected. But it was when the yamabushi didn't conform to his expectations 
<BR>
that he reacted. For instance, the participants were told to go to a sacred 
<BR>
mountain BY BUS. He asked how a sect communing with nature could use such a 
<BR>
thing and got a strange answer from the sensei: didn't you hear the Kami 
<BR>
(God) of the bus or the Kami of the concrete speak to you? Another day they 
<BR>
were told to meditate under a cold waterfall, but again he reacted- THE 
<BR>
WATERFALL WAS ARTIFICIAL. It had been built in concrete by the yamabushi. 
<BR>
Again he got a strange answer: so what? Concentrate on the Ordeal! He failed 
<BR>
the ordeal; he didn't even try. It wasn't natural. Afterwards he was shocked 
<BR>
that the sensei bought everybody a round of rice wine and beer at the local 
<BR>
pub to celebrate them coming a bit closer to their &quot;Buddha nature&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I gave this example from Vargö's book to show the differences between the 
<BR>
Western concept of spirituality and the Japanese. The Western concept is 
<BR>
still very much the Christian concept of negation, of asceticism. It is 
<BR>
decidedly much more against integrating new things and concepts into the 
<BR>
spiritual. The Creator will mind if you introduce new things in his 
<BR>
creation. Even today our intellectual leadership is still very much adverse 
<BR>
to dynamism, always quoting the &quot;Frankenstein argument&quot;. Perhaps that is why 
<BR>
so few Westerner's have gone to Japan to search &quot;spiritual enlightenment&quot;. 
<BR>
It doesn't at all conform to their concept of spirituality. Japan is too 
<BR>
rich, too affluent to really be spiritual. The Japanese spirituality must 
<BR>
have been corrupted. So they go to India, to the ashrams were they can 
<BR>
indulge in anti- materialism (and buy the guru a new Rolls Royce).
<BR>
<P>In Japan the spiritual and the material are not opposites, they are part of 
<BR>
a whole. The mountain may be a Kami; the river may be a Kami. Why not the 
<BR>
bus too? Why not the robot or the computer?
<BR>
<P>Sure, Japan has had its' long periods of stagnation- but also its' periods 
<BR>
of very encouraged dynamism. For instance the lightning quick passage from 
<BR>
stone age to iron age in the Yayoi period 300 BCE, and the lightning quick 
<BR>
passage from the middle ages to the industrial age in the Meiji period in 
<BR>
the 19th century.
<BR>
These rapid developments did become as troublesome as one might expect.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps the Japanese's concept of spirituality had something to do with 
<BR>
this. And today we notice a much greater acceptance of technology in 
<BR>
Japanese society than in the West. Just look at the huge trend of artificial 
<BR>
pets in Japan. In the West the artificial pets mostly stir emotions of 
<BR>
disgust. Consumption cannot be spiritual!
<BR>
<P>But sure it can! And I think that perhaps we transhumanists have a bit to 
<BR>
learn from the Japanese in this respect. I' m not advocating a form of 
<BR>
cyber- shintoism, but perhaps a different approach
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
<P>Waldemar
