Some snippets from various sources...
<BR>
<P>Cysteine And N-Acetyl-l-cysteine are two potent antioxidants that raise 
<BR>
glutathione levels to protect the body against premature aging and protect 
<BR>
us against degenerative diseases.
<BR>
<P>Apparently lipoic acid is the only antioxidant that can boost the level of 
<BR>
intracellular glutathione.
<BR>
<P>Agents that deplete glutathione, such as ethanol, have been shown to impair 
<BR>
the body's immune defense. TNF-a (tumor necrosis factor alpha), increased in 
<BR>
many diseases of aging, has been shown to be involved in depletion of 
<BR>
cellular glutathione. (Phelps DT et al., 1995).
<BR>
<P>Aging of the immune system is characterized not only by thymic degeneration 
<BR>
and consequent decline in functioning T-cells, but also by increased levels 
<BR>
of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) in the blood stream. TNF-a is a 
<BR>
so-called cytokine, a messenger protein involved in the regulation of 
<BR>
inflammatory and immunological responses. With aging, TNF-a becomes 
<BR>
increasingly involved in the death of T-cells. It has recently been shown 
<BR>
that T-cells from aged humans have an increased susceptibility to 
<BR>
TNF-a-mediated apoptosis (programmed cell death/ cell suicide) as compared 
<BR>
with cells from young subjects (Aggarwal S et al., 1999).
<BR>
<P>Surprisingly, the leaves of the common stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) have 
<BR>
been found to contain substances that  affect cytokine levels in the human 
<BR>
body, particularly TNF-a. Nettle leaf extract has a long tradition as a 
<BR>
medical remedy in Germany for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid 
<BR>
arthritis and allergic rhinitis.
<BR>
<P>A study by Obertreis, Giller et al. (1996) showed that nettle leaf inhibits 
<BR>
the expression of several cytokines as well as the formation of 
<BR>
pro-inflammatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, but its mode of action has 
<BR>
remained unclear. It has now been discovered that this seemingly 
<BR>
insignificant herb reduces TNF-a levels by inhibiting a genetic 
<BR>
transcription factor, known as nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kb), that 
<BR>
controls the expression of numerous enzymes and proinflammatory products 
<BR>
including TNF-a (Riehemann K et al., 1999).
<BR>
<P>&quot;Taking glutathione supplements&quot;
<BR>
Does it make any sense to take glutathione, or is it much more effective to 
<BR>
take NAC? . .
<BR>
[Glutathione is a simple tripeptide (complex of three amino acids: 
<BR>
glutamate, glycine and cysteine) and has been shown to largely survive 
<BR>
digestive degradation. Since cysteine is generally the limiting amino acid, 
<BR>
glutathionine synthesis may also be increased by NAC supplementation. -- Tom 
<BR>
] . .
<BR>
Does it make any sense to take SOD supplements? . .
<BR>
[SOD is a large complex enzyme (protein) which will not normally survived 
<BR>
digestion. Possibly enterically coated versions will get slightly absorbed 
<BR>
intact. -- Tom ] . .
<BR>
Thanks in advance
<BR>
<P>[It is a good supplement and totally harmless to take in large quantities so 
<BR>
long as sufficient vitamins C is taken with it. Some of it is undoubtedly 
<BR>
lost in digestion by being enzymatically broken into its constituent amino 
<BR>
acids. However, studies show that much of it does get through. Glutathione 
<BR>
works synergistically with vitamin C, so may sure you take lots of vitamin C 
<BR>
with it.
<BR>
<P>The problem of Superoxide dismutase uses in humans will be discussed in the 
<BR>
2nd International Conference on SOD, 18-19 May 2000 at Institut 
<BR>
Pasteur-Paris France, Chirman J. MCCORD.
<BR>
The main topics will be SOD and ageing (J. P. Philips, S. Melov..), and 
<BR>
pharmaceutical and nutritional development of SOD.
<BR>
The questions will be: Which kind of SOD for Which diseases, injectable or 
<BR>
oral form, Can SOD enhance functional foods and dietary supplements quality, 
<BR>
what about SOD in cosmetics, stability and purity.

<EM> &gt; I know of silibinin - milk thistle seeds; and maybe Deprenyl.

<P>Silymarin is supposed to increase the efficiency with which glutathione is
<BR>
recycled.
<BR>
<P>You can buy L-glutathione supplements from health food stores, but I'm not
<BR>
sure how effective they are (tends to get digested before reaching the
<BR>
bloodstream I think).  Taking alpha-lipoic acid and N-Acetyl-Cysteine (a
<BR>
precursor) might boost GSH levels.  There is a product called Thiodox by
<BR>
Nutricology that is a combination of all three.
<BR>
<P>Dr Cheney has done some work on undenatured Whey and Glutathione:

<BR>
The product he suggests is ImmunoPro, but I'm sure there are others.
