<P><EM>&gt; Also, in his _The Mismeasure of Man_, I think his goal is quite clear: to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blacken the notion of general intelligence so badly as to make it completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unpalatable.  This he does not only by direct assault -- which, by the way,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  he fails at -- but also by juxtaposing it with phrenology and the like.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I.e., he tries to associate what he does not like but might have some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  credence with what is generally thought to be ridiculous.

<P>You see, already having discounted IQ testing at about age twelve, I did not 
<BR>
walk away from that book with that &quot;goal&quot; in mind. What I saw as his &quot;goal&quot; 
<BR>
was to show how even scientists who truly believe they are doing honest 
<BR>
research are mislead by their own beliefs, even him.
