<P>&lt;&lt; The fascism meme requires that the infected person(s)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o    feel superior to some other group(s),
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o    feel the(se) other group(s) must be repressed for some reason, and
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o    feel obliged to use force against the(se) group(s).

&nbsp;I see anti-fascists fighting fascists, using exactly the same methods.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;The danger in fighting fascism is that fascism is contagious:
<BR>
&nbsp;fascists and anti-fascists become two sides of the same coin.

Yes but under fascism, the ruling political power structure ran death camps 
<BR>
and in the other they ran detention camps in which the Japanese Americans 
<BR>
survived to the level of nearly 100% and whose sons went to fight on to 
<BR>
become the most decorated American units in the 2nd world war. That's a big 
<BR>
difference, as far as most people are concerned. So goals do matter, and as 
<BR>
far as Extropians becomming nazi's; let us eliminate the the mere 'racist' 
<BR>
jargon; and call a National Socialist a nazi.  If Extropianism is a nazi 
<BR>
cause, it will soon be found out; if not (as I suspect) then this thread will 
<BR>
go moribund for a while. 
<BR>
<P>But before we do the Turner Diaries Gotterdamerung, (with the Aryans instead 
<BR>
bunking with the worms) one way to determine Extropianism's emphasis is to 
<BR>
begin to refer comments back to some of the scholars that inspired this 
<BR>
philosophy. Lets ask Moravec, and Tipler, and Minsky, and Linde, and 
<BR>
Nathaniel Brandon and Wheeler and so forth, what they would think of a 
<BR>
future-life/life extension org becomming Hitlerite? My guess is that this 
<BR>
would cause some conniption fits amongst any would-be furhers. Maybe their 
<BR>
next attempt will be some kind of KKK-Amway sales? Doh! I gave em' a 
<BR>
money-making idea. Shame on me.
