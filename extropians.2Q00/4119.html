<P>Exactly! Mother Theresa benefitted from a great PR machine that places all 
<BR>
&quot;people of the cloth&quot; a cut above the rest of us. But she doesn't stand up 
<BR>
to close scrutiny. In her world, suffering was a requirement to enter 
<BR>
heaven. She placed a relatively low value on saving life. Some people even 
<BR>
feel she did harm because her efforts, not really oriented toward healing, 
<BR>
drew resources away from legitimate medical facilities. In the USA she ran 
<BR>
into trouble when she refused to bring her facilities up to minimal 
<BR>
standards required by law. In the final analysis she was just another 
<BR>
dogmatic religious nut that cared more for &quot;souls&quot; that real human welfare. 
<BR>
If it hasn't been mentioned before in this thread, let me point out the 
<BR>
excellent book which de-bunks the Mother Theresa myth, The Missionary 
<BR>
Position. There's a review of it at

<P>What impact?  The idea that one should give up what might have been a
<BR>
productive, valuable, society-enriching life to instead preach acceptance
<BR>
of death, that most hideous of all evils, and justify it by belief in God,
<BR>
that most dangerous of beliefs.  I certainly don't hold her as any kind of
<BR>
example except bad, and I'm surprized you're surprized one would say so.
<BR>
<P>If you want to show true compassion to the dying, /do something/ about
<BR>
death itself.  Preach defiance, not acceptance.  Preach science and
<BR>
medicine, not mystical nonsense.  Use your talents to earn money to
<BR>
build the economy to fund that science and find those cures.
<BR>
<P>In case you haven't noticed, we're /all/ dying.  I, for one, don't want
<BR>
sympathy--I want an alternative.  Anyone who makes death seem any less
<BR>
tragic and wasteful and evil than it is will get no respect from me.
