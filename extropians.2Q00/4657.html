<P><EM>&gt;As to bubbles growing, even 0.99 c is

<EM>&gt;pretty fast, so that you can't expect to be able to look into the deep

<EM>&gt;elements, anyway).
</EM><BR>
<P>I certainly *can* expect to look back into the deep past, and do, with
<BR>
Hubble, and the next gadget will push the very boundaries of the light
<BR>
cone, I understand. Your point about the sterile early phase is what I was
<BR>
trying to convey myself. If the voids are in part the result of
<BR>
intergalactic god hunger, then they should be smaller or non-existent in
<BR>
the remote pre-biotic past. Are they? Maybe we *can't* yet see far enough
<BR>
back in sufficient detail.
<BR>
<P>(BTW, covering my ass against even the oddest reading: I hope you didn't
<BR>
think I meant that we'd literally be able to *watch the edges of the voids
<BR>
get bigger*, in real time, had the Big Eaters been out there, hard at work...)
