<P><EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;  But, actually, atheism is more about atheists being the kind of people who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  stand outside society, laughing at assorted silliness, such as the fact 
</EM><BR>
that 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the belief in a god is an obvious sham.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>Generalizations are not usually accurate. 
<BR>
<P>You describe an atheist as laughing at religion. That may be your stance, but 
<BR>
it is certainly not mine, or many others who are not believers. Not all 
<BR>
people who believe in god/gods/goddess/whatever are being &quot;duped&quot;. Many are 
<BR>
searching for manageable tenets on which to base their actions.
<BR>
<P>Many spiritual people have things they can teach me. 
<BR>
<P>These teachings can be extremely helpful, especially buddists and some of the 
<BR>
fringe neo-eastern groups, or the rogue fellows which the secular humanists 
<BR>
call &quot;Uncertain Deists&quot; ie they believe there's some sort of creative force, 
<BR>
but they don't call it anything in particular.
<BR>
<P>Yes, I am an atheist, and I don't tolerate quoters of idiotic psalms and 
<BR>
fundy claptrap, or allow people to try to &quot;convert&quot; me. I stop them quickly 
<BR>
by telling them Christianity is evil.
<BR>
<P>But I am not the nasty sort who makes fun of people's deep seated hopes and 
<BR>
fears.
<BR>
<P>I do feel that most organized religions are destructive. However, I find 
<BR>
tolerance and love to be a far more effective tool when dealing with 
<BR>
*intelligent* people of differing beliefs from mine. 
<BR>
<P>Then we move on to another topic. Life is too precious to spend it feeling 
<BR>
superior and smug.
