If you were giving a speech which might be publicized or trying to sway an 
<BR>
audience, or being serious, it's probably not a good idea to speak of 
<BR>
&quot;raping&quot; the planets. Why use this word? You're letting the other side frame 
<BR>
the deabte - treating a planet as an entity with rights - and adopting the 
<BR>
stance of someone who would violate these rights. In serious discussion, 
<BR>
this is a disaster.
<BR>
But I think we're &quot;among friends&quot; here and I think it can be taken as a 
<BR>
flippant comment to speak of &quot;raping mars&quot;. I don't think you're trying to 
<BR>
sway anyone's opinion because we probably are all (mostly) in favor of using 
<BR>
space's resources.
<BR>
I have a bumper sticker which says &quot;If Jesus comes back, we'll get him 
<BR>
again&quot;, I find it a very funny bumper sticker. To me, and to friends, it's 
<BR>
point is obvious, but I decided against putting it on my car. There are too 
<BR>
many people who are looking for reasons to be offended, who will look at the 
<BR>
surface meaning of something, and no deeper, and think it means I am 
<BR>
literally in favor of crucifixion of dissenters. If you publicly speak of 
<BR>
raping planets, you're very easily interpreted as saying that a planet is a 
<BR>
thing of intrinsic value which you take joy in destroying.
