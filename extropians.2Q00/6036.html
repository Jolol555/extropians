<EM>&gt; &gt; I read somewhere that someone did a survey of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recent Harvard graduates, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only a small per cent of them could explain why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are seasons (summer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; winter, etc.) on Earth.  I can't really believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is true.  Did anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; else hear anything about such a survey?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sureI believe these polls. I bartend in a
<BR>
local restaurant and we have a large number of
<BR>
highschool students working here. They all seem to
<BR>
have a pretty good grasp of basic science to me. And
<BR>
with the exception of two. They are average students.
<BR>
Admitedly they are not very good with history but I
<BR>
think that has to do with how mind numbingly boring
<BR>
most schools make history leasons
