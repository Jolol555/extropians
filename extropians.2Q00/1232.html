<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;So the question remains what amount of computational

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;neuron plays?  Any takers?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Here's a data point I came across recently:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/Publications/annreps/annrep92/schutt.html">http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/Publications/annreps/annrep92/schutt.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It's a 92 paper describing a simulation of one specific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; complex neuron.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Impressive!  Using their somewhat simplified simulation of the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complex neuron in the nervous system (the Purkinje), it still took their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i860 processor almost an hour to run a simulation of a single firing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How this translates into computational requirements for the typical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neuron remains to be seen, but I think it proves that simulating a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neuron is not a trivial task.
</EM><BR>
<P>Definitely not trivial. The Purkinje cell might be a bit more
<BR>
branching and have more synapses than the vanilla pyramidal cells of
<BR>
the cortex, but not much.
<BR>
<P>In most computational neuroscience models of neurons they are divided
<BR>
into compartments treated as isopotential; they are each described by
<BR>
their membrane potential, the concentrations of sodium, potassium,
<BR>
calcium and sometimes chloride ions and the state of various ion
<BR>
channels. The number of compartment varies a lot, 100,000 is on the
<BR>
largest scale so far - we are quite limited by our lack of really good
<BR>
morphological cell data not to mention electrophysiological data. 
<BR>
<P>Other chemical processes need to be added at the synapses, especially
<BR>
for plasticity models. A fellow researcher made a simplified (!) model
<BR>
involving just 30-40 chemicals (many of which were variously
<BR>
phosphorylated states of a protein) of the long term potentiation
<BR>
phenomenon.
<BR>
<P>Yes, neurons are much more complex than simple transistors. But it is
<BR>
not obvious that all this complexity makes them *much* more complex -
<BR>
there are clever simplifications of certain kinds of dendritic trees
<BR>
and many of the chemical networks could be described more compactly
<BR>
using a phenomenological model. There are ways of doing reductions of
<BR>
cells that (at the price of requiring sharp minds) can create models
<BR>
that does qualitatively and often quantitatively the same as much more
<BR>
complex models.
<BR>
<P>The real complexity lies in the manifold interactions between neurons,
<BR>
individual neurons have a fairly limited repertoire of behavior but
<BR>
when you connect a few of them into a network, especially modulated by
<BR>
different chemicals, then they can do nearly anything.
