<P>
Brian: I'm not finding this discussion productive, and you seem also to 
<BR>
find our respective views too far apart to want to continue, so I'm going 
<BR>
to try to discontinue this discussion by keeping this response brief. You 
<BR>
have perceptions of Extropians and of libertarians that I disagree with. I 
<BR>
don't see any clear way to resolve our differing perceptions so I'm not 
<BR>
going to continue to try.
<BR>
<P>I will comment on your left-right point, just to say that I found your Bush 
<BR>
example only reinforces my point about the uselessness of the left-right 
<BR>
division. You picked *one* kind of policy (fiscal) where there is a view 
<BR>
that many would call &quot;right-wing&quot;, i.e. opposition to increased government 
<BR>
spending. What if Bush talked about strengthening drug laws, banning 
<BR>
abortion, curtailing immigration, restricting &quot;immoral&quot; communications on 
<BR>
the net, to pick a few out of many possible examples? These would also be 
<BR>
called &quot;right-wing&quot; positions, yet libertarians would be against them all. 
<BR>
&quot;Right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; do not group views that have any real underlying 
<BR>
economic or philosophical consistency. The terms originally meant 
<BR>
conservative and radical. The left/right division may be simple and handy 
<BR>
for most public commentators but serious political philosophers and social 
<BR>
theorists do not usually employ these terms.
<BR>
<P>It would make far better sense to say that Extropians favor decentralized, 
<BR>
market-based, voluntaristic, emergent-order solutions to social 
<BR>
coordination issues than centrally-imposed solutions. That's much more 
<BR>
specific and informative than &quot;right-wing&quot;. There are many people and 
<BR>
groups described as right-wing who favor centralized control in numerous 
<BR>
situations.
<BR>
<P>I appreciate you clarifying and qualifying your claims, to say that you 
<BR>
were not making statements about all Extropians. I do think you gave that 
<BR>
impression. You disagree. I will leave it at that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Hm.... this discussion probably isn't worth continuing much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;further.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed. You think the individuals you communicated with had &quot;irrational&quot; 
<BR>
(not just mistaken) views about circumcision. I did not participate in 
<BR>
those discussions and so will not say anything more about this. It hardly 
<BR>
seems of much relevance to transhumanists.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You don't seem &quot;to have ears&quot; for this discusion (to speak
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nietzschean). So I think I'll stop here.
</EM><BR>
<P>Accusing me of being unwilling to listen is pointless. I could do the same 
<BR>
to you. It won't get us anywhere, so I will not do so. Some of your other 
<BR>
comments seem unnecessarily inflammatory, but I refuse to be inflamed.
<BR>
<P>If we are to discuss political and economic differences among 
<BR>
transhumanists, why not take the emphasis away from general criticisms and 
<BR>
instead ask which specific policies and procedures will best further our 
<BR>
shared transhumanist goals while respecting our personal values?
<BR>
<P>Onward!
