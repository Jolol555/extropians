<P>Has not the interstate highway gone a long way in erasing regional
<BR>
issues, by mixing people from all over?  The faceless shell stations
<BR>
and minimarts at every freeway exit all look alike and are manned
<BR>
by pretty much universal Ahpu-like employees.
<BR>
<P>What we need is something analogous to the interstate highway
<BR>
system that covers the world instead of the U.S. or failing that,
<BR>
some international mercantile of some sort, where one can purchase
<BR>
any electronics, food, books, international news, etc.  Then when
<BR>
travelling abroad, anywhere, if one should be overwelmed with
<BR>
the differentness of it all, one should have the option of retreating
<BR>
to one of these international minimarts, with its everywhere-identical
<BR>
layout and products, international language and so on.  Each of
<BR>
these would serve as a modular embassy of sorts, to always remind
<BR>
people, regardless of which country they happen to live in, that
<BR>
they are citizens of earth.
<BR>
<P>How about that?  spike
