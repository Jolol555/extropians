<EM>&gt; There is no question that a completely transparent society would be near
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impossible to implement *now*.  However, all the obstacles you mention are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dependent upon present-day public attitudes and present-day technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Both of these are rapidly changing, even exponentially so.  So when you
</EM><BR>
tell
<BR>
<EM>&gt; me that ubiquitous surveillance won't happen *in the future* I simply
</EM><BR>
don't
<BR>
<EM>&gt; believe it.  I could be wrong, but I don't believe it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Loosely speaking, the capacity of any society to implement a universal
<BR>
surveillance system would be proportional to per capita wealth times
<BR>
available technology. Less obviously, the ability of the same society to
<BR>
implement security measures is determined by exactly the same equation.
<BR>
<P>Security vs. surveillance is an arms race, just like projective penetration
<BR>
ability vs. armor stopping power. That isn't obvious, because until recently
<BR>
the natural defenses provided by geography, biology and (most of all) human
<BR>
information processing capacity were sufficient to make any attempt at
<BR>
universal surveillance a hopeless task. But these limits are fixed, so as
<BR>
technology improves they will gradually become insignificant and the arms
<BR>
race effect will come to predominate.
<BR>
<P>Unless some unforeseen technology emerges to give one side to the that a
<BR>
dramatic advantage, surveillance appears to be a typical arms race case.
<BR>
Neither &quot;attack&quot; nor &quot;defense&quot; has a large inherent advantage, so the victor
<BR>
will depend on circumstances. Keeping what you do in public a secret will be
<BR>
almost impossible, but keeping what happens in your house a secret is a much
<BR>
easier problem. Many of the places people are most interested in keeping
<BR>
private (small enclosed spaces, virtual worlds, personal records and online
<BR>
activity) are inherently quite easy to defend against surveillance, unless
<BR>
you have the government outlaw defensive technologies.
<BR>
<P>All in all, I see no reason to predict a big win for either side in this
<BR>
struggle based purely on the evolution of technology.
