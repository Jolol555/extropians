&nbsp;It's important! We need to show these people(monsters), that we won't 
<BR>
&nbsp;tolerate the genetic manipulation of our animal kingdom. There's an 
<BR>
&nbsp;interesting article at the bottom from the Minneapolis Star Tribune about 
<BR>
&nbsp;the issue.

&nbsp;JULY 20-26
<BR>
&nbsp;STOP THE MAD SCIENTISTS IN THEIR TRACKS!
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Earth and Animal Liberation activists will converge in the Twin
<BR>
&nbsp;Cities of Minnesota, to greet the International Society for
<BR>
&nbsp;Animal Genetics (ISAG) at their University of Minnesota
<BR>
&nbsp;conference. A wide range of activities is planned to help
<BR>
&nbsp;mobilize against the rapidly developing bio technologies that
<BR>
&nbsp;threaten wildlife,
<BR>
&nbsp;and aim to control and commodify living beings on a entirely new
<BR>
&nbsp;level.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Workshops, discussions, trainings and presentations on science,
<BR>
&nbsp;ethics, politics and action strategy and tactics, as well as
<BR>
&nbsp;direct action videos, will provide the inspiration we need to
<BR>
&nbsp;join forces
<BR>
&nbsp;and bring down the heinous biotechnology industry.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;BACKGROUND ON ISAG
<BR>
&nbsp;(<A HREF="http://www.wisc.edu/animalsci/isag/index.html">http://www.wisc.edu/animalsci/isag/index.html</A>)
<BR>
&nbsp;The International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG) is based in
<BR>
&nbsp;Madison, Wisconsin and includes animal geneticists around the
<BR>
&nbsp;world. They publish a highly technical journal out of the UK
<BR>
&nbsp;called Animal Genetics
<BR>
&nbsp;(<A HREF="http://www.blacksci.co.uk/products/journals/agen.htm">http://www.blacksci.co.uk/products/journals/agen.htm</A>),
<BR>
&nbsp;reporting on the research frontlines of economically important
<BR>
&nbsp;and domestic animals. ISAG scientists are busy mapping the
<BR>
&nbsp;genomes of common livestock animals, to determine new and
<BR>
&nbsp;cutting edge methods of disease resistance and improvement for
<BR>
&nbsp;market and laboratory uses. Cattle, Sheep and Goats, Dog, Horse,
<BR>
&nbsp;Pig, Poultry, and Rabbit are all in the research pipeline, and
<BR>
&nbsp;mice and monkeys are already being genetically manipulated for
<BR>
&nbsp;lab science. The University of Minnesota and is a major center
<BR>
&nbsp;of animal GE research, especially in the genetic enhancement
<BR>
&nbsp;and improvement of livestock that is more suited to the
<BR>
&nbsp;livestock industries. These industries fund conferences like
<BR>
&nbsp;ISAG, hire such scientists for their own R&amp;D departmenrts, using
<BR>
&nbsp;the genetic technologies developed in the universities. The
<BR>
&nbsp;federal govt is a major sponsor and contributor to animal GE,
<BR>
&nbsp;through the Agricultural Research Service and the USDA.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;For an example of government-funded livestock improvement
<BR>
&nbsp;projects, check out:
<BR>
&nbsp;<A HREF="http://sol.marc.usda.gov/marc/html/gene1.html">http://sol.marc.usda.gov/marc/html/gene1.html</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;Any time you see that the government or a corporation is
<BR>
&nbsp;mapping the genome of a species, it means they are doing so to
<BR>
&nbsp;eventually manipulate the genetic make-up of that species. Such
<BR>
&nbsp;manipulation is often justified as only one step beyond
<BR>
&nbsp;conventional breeding, yet the intention is the same,
<BR>
&nbsp;especially with animals, who have no worth to scientists,
<BR>
&nbsp;corprations or universities, beyond their economic use. Genetic
<BR>
&nbsp;engineering IS only one step beyond conventional breeding, and
<BR>
&nbsp;we contend that even most conventional breeding is driven by
<BR>
&nbsp;both profit, AND an extreme disregard for the role of non-human
<BR>
&nbsp;animals in the interdependent web of life.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;While the suffering of animals is definitely a major concern
<BR>
&nbsp;with animal GE, the problems inherent in animal science run much
<BR>
&nbsp;deeper. Animal GE is simply the latest tool of capitalist
<BR>
&nbsp;technology, but one we feel could finally awaken people to the
<BR>
&nbsp;crisis faced by every species on this planet: the corporate
<BR>
&nbsp;ownership and commodification of life itself. After conquering
<BR>
&nbsp;almost every mountain, forest, river and distinctive human
<BR>
&nbsp;community on earth, business elites are seeking new colonies to
<BR>
&nbsp;control and exploit. Factory and fur farming have already
<BR>
&nbsp;created waste and enslavement of wildlife. Now the mad
<BR>
&nbsp;scientists are eager to offer GE animals up to the market.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Will it take the total control and manipulation of humans
<BR>
&nbsp;themselves (notice that public and private agencies alike are
<BR>
&nbsp;racing each other to map the human genome?) to provoke a
<BR>
&nbsp;reaction? If they are so willing to improve the non-market
<BR>
&nbsp;friendly traits of domestic animals, why should we think that
<BR>
&nbsp;simliar traits in humans wont be the next of sciences targets?
<BR>
&nbsp;Already, domestic companion dogs can be froxen and cloned for
<BR>
&nbsp;$20,000, so good olkd Spot will never really die. (see:
<BR>
&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.geneticsavingsandclone.com">http://www.geneticsavingsandclone.com</A>).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;You may think that scientists are the least responsible for such
<BR>
&nbsp;madness- that its the policy makers who decide what falls
<BR>
&nbsp;within socially accepted boundaries. But under a government
<BR>
&nbsp;based on the accumulation of capital, and the assumption of
<BR>
&nbsp;industrial progress, no rulers could be expected to value the
<BR>
&nbsp;inherent freedoms of living beings- animal or human. ISAG is
<BR>
&nbsp;being targetted as a challenge to the very scientific
<BR>
&nbsp;establishment itself. None of us will understand the terminology
<BR>
&nbsp;they throw at us - and hopefully people will not feel the need
<BR>
&nbsp;to play into their science-based justifications for the
<BR>
&nbsp;atrocities to which they are so desensitized, and which they
<BR>
&nbsp;perform daily without question.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Our society has to start posing a serious challenge to their
<BR>
&nbsp;industrial science dogma, and the capitalist ideology that
<BR>
&nbsp;accompanies it so conveniently. This means crafting our demands
<BR>
&nbsp;on different terms from theirs. It is expected that the
<BR>
&nbsp;corporate media will disregard our perspective since we are not
<BR>
&nbsp;willing to play by their rules of engagement by debating the
<BR>
&nbsp;level of suffering of cloned animals, or the scientific
<BR>
&nbsp;usefulness of thir practices. Our demands must go farther. ISAG
<BR>
&nbsp;is a good excuse to rail against one of the foundations of our
<BR>
&nbsp;death-culture.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;And as usual, action always speaks louder than words.

<BR>
&nbsp;PIC's core business is delivering healthy genetic improvement
<BR>
&nbsp;to pig industries around the world...
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;PIC is the international leader in the genetic improvement of
<BR>
&nbsp;swine for breeding and the food industry. Offering the pig
<BR>
&nbsp;farmer such services as artificial insemination, husbandry and
<BR>
&nbsp;management, superior breeding stock, and the latest in porcine
<BR>
&nbsp;biotechnology advances. With companies in over 30 countries
<BR>
&nbsp;worldwide, PIC is able to cater to the specific needs of each of
<BR>
&nbsp;its customers.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;PIC is a supplier of pig breeding stock. We have proprietary
<BR>
&nbsp;purebred lines that we continually improve by applying
<BR>
&nbsp;scientific principles to the selection of each new generation.
<BR>
&nbsp;Specialist subcontracted multiplication farms then crossbreed
<BR>
&nbsp;the purelines to produce breeding stock that is sold by PIC to
<BR>
&nbsp;the worlds commercial pig producers. Thus, PIC concentrates its
<BR>
&nbsp;investments on the technology of improving pigs and the
<BR>
&nbsp;servicing of commercial producers. PIC is clearly the world
<BR>
&nbsp;leader in its field; operating in 30 countries, PIC has
<BR>
&nbsp;established businesses in Western Europe and the Americas and is
<BR>
&nbsp;currently investing in the developing markets of Asia and
