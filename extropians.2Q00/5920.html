<P><EM>&gt; I don't think these comments are necessarily being made in jest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some people do believe that planets are an inefficient use of mass.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most of the mass is on the interior and doesn't do anyone any good, aside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from providing some gravity.  And if you need that, you can probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get it more efficiently by centrifugal force or stellar gravity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It may be that these ideas are difficult for people to accept and do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bring to mind the environmental catastrophes in the past.  But I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think we should necessarily tone down our views as a result.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are our views &quot;Let's destroy planets!&quot; or are they &quot;Let's create new
<BR>
biospheres!&quot;? You might mean the later, but in most communities you
<BR>
will be misunderstood as the former if you express yourself badly. It
<BR>
is not that the idea is hard to accept that is the problem, it is that
<BR>
the idea itself tends to get overshadowed by how it is expressed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nobody is going to be taking Mercury apart in the next decade.  But 50
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or 100 years from now, it may be possible and desirable.  At that point,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society's social views will probably have changed at least as much as our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own views have changed from those 50 or 100 years ago.  There is no way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to predict whether future society will be radical environmentalists or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;pave the universe&quot; developers by our own standards.  I don't think we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to be that careful to couch our views in a manner which is acceptable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to this month's mores.
</EM><BR>
<P>We are vectors of cultural change. But if we refuse to notice that
<BR>
people misunderstand us, form prejudiced and erroneous opionons about
<BR>
our ethics, values and ideas and then act on them, then we are not
<BR>
going to be very relevant vectors. Those movements that actually
<BR>
manage to convey what they mean to significant groups will win.
