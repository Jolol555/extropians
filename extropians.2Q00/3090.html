<P>Tightness of coupling doesn't matter if you happen to think that
<BR>
consciousness is information/computation.  Many functionalists have
<BR>
argued that the entire economy, along with a variety of other
<BR>
sufficiently complicated social structures, are already independently
<BR>
conscious.  The net would just be yet another item on the list.
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
Well, frogs are also independently conscious, but I would not consider it to
<BR>
be in the same class as human consciousness. I think that economies and
<BR>
similar systems are much closer to ecologies than to conscious entities with
<BR>
a self-sense.
<BR>
<P>Dan:
<BR>
This is the only context in which it might matter whether or not the
<BR>
entity is &quot;complex&quot; enough to host consciousness... other definitions
<BR>
of consciousness, generally, don't require complexity (that is, a
<BR>
variety of interconnected parts) in order to get the job done,
<BR>
explaining why, for example, your &quot;soul&quot; could, at least in principle,
<BR>
find its way into an insect, while it's quite clear that the contents
<BR>
of your brain could not.
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
Soul?! Please re-read my previous post. The Buddhist idea I explicated is
<BR>
called the &quot;no-soul&quot; concept. The energy that reincarnates is not a &quot;soul.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Dan:
<BR>
Talking about the frequency of thoughts suggests that one can identify
<BR>
and isolate particular thoughts independent from other thoughts, and
<BR>
count them at a certain rate.  I don't think the brain is like this;
<BR>
this is sort of the wrong question to ask.  Before you can ask &quot;how
<BR>
fast,&quot; you have to decide what you want to call &quot;fast.&quot;  (Problem
<BR>
solving capability?)
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
I use the term &quot;thoughts&quot; advisedly to refer to mental events with which we
<BR>
are all familiar. If you prefer, we can use an analysis such as the one
<BR>
Moravec used in MIND CHILDREN to compare the processing of various animals
<BR>
and computers. Subjectively, we could think at any rate without knowing what
<BR>
was fast or slow until we compared our mental processes to objective
<BR>
processes with which we interact. If you can't process quick enough, please
<BR>
don't drive!
<BR>
<P>Dan:
<BR>
Finally, the epistemological question is especially troublesome.  How
<BR>
would we know if you had reincarnated one-to-one into a baby?
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
There is no indisputable proof at this time. However, some psychiatrist have
<BR>
studied children who claim to remember previous incarnations and the
<BR>
evidence is, to me, quite fascinating. Check out:

<P>Dan:
<BR>
Psychoanalytic uncovery of past lives isn't exactly an empirical
<BR>
science these days.  Anyway, if the net IS conscious, it seems clear
<BR>
to me that we'll never get it on the couch.  However, there is a great
<BR>
deal of evidence that the net is here to stay for a long, long time,
<BR>
with subnets, etc forming every day.  So, assuming reincarnation works
<BR>
at all, you could always take a wait and see policy: if you find
<BR>
yourself occupying the Internet not long after death, well, it must be
<BR>
possible after all.
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
No, recovering past life memories is not empirical. Yet. But I don't limit
<BR>
potential to what we can do these days, or else I wouldn't be on this list!
<BR>
As far as the Net either being or becoming conscious (with or without
<BR>
reincarnation), how would we know for sure? I recall Vernor Vinge mentioning
<BR>
in an interview some years ago that he was looking for certain signs he
<BR>
declined to mention then which he deemed evidence of consciousness. Anyone
<BR>
happen to know exactly what phenomena Vinge is looking for?
