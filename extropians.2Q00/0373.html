<EM>&gt; Of course in a situation where the parents are already dead or incapacitated

<EM>&gt; struggle and the criminal is almost on him, there would be a problem.  This 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be a rare and worst case scenario.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>In households with guns, where the children are often taught the proper
<BR>
handling and respect for guns before they can even lift one, this
<BR>
situation plays out more often than you would expect.  The criminals go
<BR>
after the parents and ignore the kids, only to find the kids holding a gun
<BR>
and with the skill to use it.  Most criminals do not consider an
<BR>
apparently unarmed kid to be a real source of resistance.

<P><P><EM>&gt; I am very sorry for your loss.  I have a friend who used to be a farmer in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Idaho.  A biker gang gang-raped a fourteen year-old girl from her town and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drove to their nearby headquarters thinking they could get away with it.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The whole town mobilized with the leadership of the sheriff and they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surrounded the biker hangout.  A gunfight ensued and thousands of rounds 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were fired.  No bikers survived the incident.  Some bikers may be cool guys, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but these were not and got what they deserved.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I find Idaho to be a very interesting place.  The people up there are
<BR>
generally very friendly to the point where they don't even lock their
<BR>
doors in many places, but they have zero tolerance for sociopaths and you
<BR>
can pretty much expect an armed response if you decide to engage in
<BR>
violent criminal behavior.
<BR>
<P>In a similar story, several years ago the asian crime gangs decided to
<BR>
expand their influence into Boise, Idaho from where they were operating in
<BR>
Salt Lake City.  The trademark crime of these gangs in the U.S. is the
<BR>
home invasion robbery, where half a dozen guys with guns kick in your door
<BR>
in the middle of the night, and if you are lucky, they steal your stuff
<BR>
and leave you alive.  Idaho being Idaho, when they attempted these
<BR>
robberies in Boise, more often than not they were met with a hail of hot
<BR>
lead, creating a rather large spike in self-defense shootings.  The
<BR>
police would then come by, bag the dead, and arrest the wounded.  Within a
<BR>
year, the asian gangs had suffered such serious losses that they left
<BR>
Boise for greener pastures.  Sounds like natural selection in action to me.
