Hi,
<BR>
<P>I think one good idea is Steve Jackson's GURPS, Generic Universal Role-Playing
<BR>
System.  Another thing to keep in mind is Shadowrun, although its VR/Matrix rules
<BR>
were more abstracted to computer metaphors.
<BR>
<P>With the disclaimer that I have been not using any RPG systems for more than five
<BR>
years, I remember the first boxed edition of GURPS, I thought it was very good when
<BR>
I was 16 or something.  There were four or five different theme ruleset
<BR>
supplements, I had at least the space one and thought it well though-out and
<BR>
devised, particularly the technology rules, although the then-proposed timeframe
<BR>
might be compressed in reality.  I have corresponded with Senor Jackson several
<BR>
times about simulation.  Before that I was into mostly Advanced Dungeons and
<BR>
Dragons, I am familiar with every word of each first edition book.  I never played
<BR>
as much as absorbed the rulesets which fascinated my statistical mind.  Shadowrun
<BR>
came later I was not into it but remember reading its rules about computer hacking.
<BR>
<P>Matrix could be converted to GURPS quite well, I would believe.  I came across a
<BR>
links site to GURPS conversions the other day,
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.skypoint.com/~slocum/gurps/conv.html">http://www.skypoint.com/~slocum/gurps/conv.html</A>.  Largely physical realm rules
<BR>
apply within the Matrix, and the rest could be put into place. Some character
<BR>
skillsets would exist in virtual mode, and others not.
<BR>
<P>Shadowrun did have facility for black ICE where hacker attempts could be met with
<BR>
physically fatal feedback.
<BR>
<P>Anyways I am out of that scene but that is the way I would go about it.  I still
<BR>
have dice.
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; They are certainly many scenes in the movie that do not correspond to hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; science, nor to precedence within the movie.  When Trinity shoots the agent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the roof, she says &quot;dodge this&quot;, why does he not?  Well that it did not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It actually goes beyond this.  Why do any of the agents bullets ever miss?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It seems that the agents have virtually unlimited processing capacity at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their disposal but limited bandwidth into the Matrix, less apparently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than even the humans.  Clearly the agents aren't a physical part of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Matrix, otherwise they would be able respond almost instantaneously to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rapidly changing event streams in the Matrix.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; One thing that is clear from the movie, and which may have ramifications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the sequels, is that there seem to be several very large systems in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; existence with Matrix-class computational abilities, all of which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; loosely interconnected.  These systems appear to be quite capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; running one or more AIs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You're onto something James. I've been thinking on the same lines...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thing is, the old cracker versus sysadmin storyline doesn't hold up to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much. If the AIs were truly in control of the system, the resistance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't have a chance. They could do whatever they liked with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simulation, and they could also just not allow the Nebuchanezzar's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signal to access the system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My idea - they're not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I should introduce a little project of mine. I'm an avid roleplayer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and so are thw two friends I was with when I first went to see the film.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; About five minutes after walking out of the film, in the middle of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conversation, we all suddenly stopped and had the same thought...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Damn, wouldn't a Matrix RPG be cool?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And so, I'm writing it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is an interesting challenge. You know how, when a good book or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something gets made into a film, it is inevitably simplified and changed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a somewhat predictable manner?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, basically I'm working to do the reverse. Also, since the objective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is an RPG, the universe has to be even more well thought out and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consistent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now - where was I? Oh yes, the AIs. No, they don't control the Matrix.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If they did, the resistance wouldn't stand a chance. The Matrix is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ultimate development of the 'net. The AIs have taken over much of it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and connected vast numbers of humans to it via their own constructed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems (the ones you see Neo awake in). They can monitor the I/O of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone connected to the Matrix *through their systems*. That's what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Agents are doing with their earpieces - they are alerted to surprise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reactions from anyone in the city. And they can then take over that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person's connection (this is how they 'posess' their bodies).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At this point, I should introduce you a little to the client/server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; structure of the Matrix.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is a master server. The AIs do not have control of this. In fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it seems no-one even knows where it is, or who controls it. It is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system which runs the simulation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are secondary servers, to which the end clients (people) actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connect. The AIs have built there own, and interfaced it to the network.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, the master server requires a *lot* of integrity checks on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; secondary servers. One of these is to ensure the physical statistics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (speed, strength, etc) for the connected clients are not tampered with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fortunately for the AIs, there was a loophole in this part of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system, which allowed them to introduce a small number (three) of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entities with all attributes pushed to maximum. This gives them their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speed and their strength... but as Morpheus says, &quot;they still live in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universe based on rules&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, what are the resistance fighters doing to bend the rules?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ever played Quake 3?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One of the features of that game's multiplayer system is client-side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; processing. With older multiplayer games, you had to rely on the server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for all your information. Now, the server can just tell you that player
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4 has fired a rocket on whatever trajectory, and your machine can track
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it itself. This allows the game to require less bandwidth, and be less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limited by the players' network latency. The dreaded Laaaaaaaagggg...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This isn't exclusive to Quake 3. It's been done before - one of the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; examples is Jedi Knight. The usual problem with lag is that other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; players look like they're in one place, but they've actually already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moved from there - you just havent' been informed of the move yet. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; makes shooting them bloody difficult, and insanely frustrating. JK
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allowed the player's game client to have a say in whether they made a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hit. That is, if your opponent looked like he was standing in front of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you, and your client thought you'd hit him, the server believed your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; client and they took the appropriate damage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now... see what I'm getting at? These systems rely on the closed-source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature of the clients - because by sending the appropriate signals to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the server, one can cheat (in JK, the trick on LAN games was to wait
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; till your opponent was right in front of you, disconnect your network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cable, whack him a few times with your lightsaber, and then plug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself back in...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So what the resistance fighters are doing is exploiting the system's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support of client-side processing. If they *believe* they can move that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fast, they do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Don't think you can... *know* you can!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                         -- Morpheus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All goes quite neatly, n'est pas?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmmm... what else? Oh yes... what are the AIs actually *doing*. Well,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there's a number of guesses. Maybe they're observing us. Perhaps they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think existence inside the Matrix is in our own best interests [this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my actual thinking behind it all - when the AI consciousness was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started, it was given a set of imperatives similar to Asimov's laws -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it was to protect the humans and make them happy. This is how it chose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do it]. Oh, and there's even some crackpots who think they're using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us for batteries... [Morpheus's nonsense is debunked thoroughly in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version].
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Other bits and pieces...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Oracle? Ew. Yuck. Leaving that out - I can't find any useful way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to explain that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The One? Yuck also. I am sick of Messiah plotlines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Neo's death &amp; revival - although I didn't particularly like the Sleeping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Beauty ending, this can be covered. His real body wasn't actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damaged, of course. And his mind had become sufficently free from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system and aware of its nature (see the scene where he begins to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the whole world, and the agents, as green lines of code to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manipulated at his will) that he wasn't quite as immersed. Although his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heart stopped briefly, external stimulus (Trinity touching him, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; telling him she loved him) was enough to bring his attention to the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've got quite a lot more ideas on this going round - but I'd quite like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to hear everyone's opinions on what I've said so far.
