<EM>&gt; ...I imagined this incredible pyramid scheme, with everybody putting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money in and hoping desperately to be able to guess when it would collapse - 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better than the rest of the suckers.  Then, when the pyramid starts quaking, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they see that there's another one to jump to that's still going up.  But 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they quickly drive that one to the limit as well, so they then jump back to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get in on the bargains in the first one.  Problem is that there isn't much 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new money available from anywhere, so this oscillation is just a predictor 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the imminent general collapse.
</EM><BR>
<P>The pyramid-scheme analogy was made by some eminent pundit in the
<BR>
Times a month or so ago. The interesting thing though is it's an
<BR>
emergent pyramid - one that's just popped into being rather than being
<BR>
deliberately designed. I like the idea of an unconscious, collective
<BR>
fraud.
<BR>
<P>Each investor acts rationally: if I think a stock with .com in the
<BR>
title but no real value will go up because everyone else is an idiot,
<BR>
then it makes perfect sense to buy. I just want to make money. Buying
<BR>
makes even more sense if I figure enough other people are reasoning
<BR>
the same way, which has certainly seemed true over the last couple of
<BR>
years.
<BR>
<P>If enough people bid in then the prophesy fulfills itself and the same
<BR>
reasoning is yet more justified the next time round. It's a crock, and
<BR>
I _know_ it's a crock, but locally the correct thing to do is buy. The
<BR>
globally crazy result is the outcome of millions of independently
<BR>
sensible decisions - insanity emerges.
