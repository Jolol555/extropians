&nbsp;------------------ 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What if a person had undergone such a radical personality shift
</EM><BR>
that he wold loathe his former self and wish to forget the former
<BR>
self as though it(he?)had never existed?  Was the former self
<BR>
a necessary precursor of the present
<BR>
self?  If so, could loathing the former self be considered the
<BR>
same sort of unpleasant emotion as loathing one's present self?
<BR>
&nbsp;If it were possible to destroy or alter a portion of the brain
<BR>
so as to entirely eliminate the
<BR>
memory of the earlier self, would this change the present personality
<BR>
of the person?&lt;
<BR>
<P>Flames burn and hurt but our senses and memory uses this knowledge
<BR>
as a safety mechanism.  The aspects of our behavior that damage
<BR>
our well being - burn and hurt us - act as warning devices of
<BR>
actions either we performed, or we witnessed someone else perform,
<BR>
that our consciousness valve does not want to repeat.
<BR>
<P>The repulsion of aspects of our behavior, or someone else’s behavior,
<BR>
depends on bad memory associations and our ability to accept
<BR>
and deal with the emotional conflicts the act produces.  Many
<BR>
people prefer to push bad associations or memories under the
<BR>
carpet, pretending that the distasteful or repulsive acts never
<BR>
existed.  This can be far more damaging than facing them.  Also,
<BR>
the magnitude of the act coupled with a person’s emotional stability,
<BR>
sense of survival and mental flexibility have relevance.  One
<BR>
person may be haunted forever by stealing or lying.  Another
<BR>
person may find this as a way of life, but may be haunted by
<BR>
infidelity, while the first person may find that sexual indiscretions
<BR>
is a way of life.  (Both could be seated next to each other at
<BR>
church -:) 
<BR>
<P>I’d like to suggest Max’s dissertation The Diachronic Self: Identity,
<BR>
Continuity, Transformation <A HREF="http://www.maxmore.com/disscont.htm">http://www.maxmore.com/disscont.htm</A>.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>My view is that if a person recognized an act as being so ghastly
<BR>
that he or she would want to erase it from memory, than this
<BR>
conscious act must be produced by a some - even a dab of conscience.
<BR>
&nbsp;The decision to rub out a repugnant memory would be produced
<BR>
by the transition self, or &quot;transself.&quot;  If the new modified
<BR>
self has utterly no memory of the former self or the transition
<BR>
self, then would this person be a different personality in total
<BR>
or in part?  Even though the bad memory has been erased, the
<BR>
person still has other memories.  Detail:  memories are interconnected,
<BR>
so the eraser would have to be very efficient to a find and replace
<BR>
any and all references to the bad act.  Even so, the person has
<BR>
other memories and this would be the same memories as the former
<BR>
self and the transition self.  In any case, it seems to me that
<BR>
the transition self would be wise enough to know that it would
<BR>
be best to have some reminder of the bad act so not to repeat
<BR>
it.  
<BR>
<P>I think a better way to deal with the situation is to have error-correction
<BR>
devices that eliminate a total recall, but provide a memory for
<BR>
memory-assist, rather than memory wipe-out.
