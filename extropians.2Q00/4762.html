Below is a description of an excellent paper.

<BR>
ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS ILLUSTRATE THE MERITS OF PRIVATIZATION
<BR>
<P>The benefits of privatization are easy to grasp conceptually, but
<BR>
measuring them precisely presents economists with many challenges.
<BR>
Differences in accounting methods, regulations, market environments
<BR>
and -- most importantly -- bottom-line objectives can make comparing
<BR>
the performance of privatized companies and government operations as
<BR>
dubious as comparing apples and oranges.
<BR>
<P>Fortunately, examples appear now and then making the difference
<BR>
between the two quantifiable, as economist Jonathan M. Karpoff (Univ.
<BR>
of Washington) explains in a new study comparing public and private
<BR>
exploration of the arctic (&quot;Public Versus Private Initiative in
<BR>
Arctic Exploration: The Effects of Incentives and Organizational
<BR>
Structure&quot; Independent Institute Working Paper #23).
<BR>
<P>&quot;From 1818 to 1905,&quot; writes Karpoff, &quot;35 government and 57
<BR>
privately-funded expeditions sought to locate and navigate a
<BR>
Northwest Passage, discover the North Pole, and make other
<BR>
significant discoveries in arctic regions. Most arctic discoveries
<BR>
were made by private expeditions. Most tragedies were publicly
<BR>
funded. By other measures as well [ship losses, crew deaths, scurvy],
<BR>
publicly-funded expeditions performed poorly.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Karpoff uses statistical methods to factor out differences in
<BR>
exploratory objectives, country of origin, leadership experience, and
<BR>
decade of expedition, allowing him to reach some remarkable
<BR>
conclusions.
<BR>
<P>* Government expeditions had a death rate almost 50% higher than that
<BR>
of private expeditions (8.9% death rate versus 6.0%).
<BR>
<P>* Government expeditions had a ship-loss rate about 55% higher than
<BR>
that of private expeditions (32.5% loss rate versus 20.9%).
<BR>
<P>* Of government expeditions that lasted longer than one year, 47%
<BR>
were debilitated by scurvy, compared to 13% for private expeditions.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Compared to private expeditions, public expeditions: (1) employed
<BR>
leaders that were relatively unmotivated and unprepared for arctic
<BR>
exploration; (2) separated the initiation and implementation
<BR>
functions of executive leadership; and (3) adapted slowly to new
<BR>
information about clothing, diet, shelter, modes of arctic travel,
<BR>
organizational structure, and optimal party size. These shortcomings
<BR>
resulted from, and contributed to, poorly aligned incentives among
<BR>
key contributors.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The bottom line?
<BR>
<P>&quot;Men died and ships were lost not because of the public nature of the
<BR>
funding per se, but rather, because of the perverse incentives, slow
<BR>
adaptation, and ineffective organizational structures that frequently
<BR>
accompanied public funding,&quot; Karpoff concludes.

<P>This paper is of course suggestive regarding the benefits of private
<BR>
exploration of space.  It would be interesting to have dollar
<BR>
estimates for the cost of such explorations, relative to then
<BR>
current per capita income.  That might help us estimate how low
<BR>
the cost of space exploration needs to fall before substantial
<BR>
private exploration might begin.
