</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'll forward a posting on a proposal for a maximally automated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; village. The question is, How far could we go with automating all standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; maintenance and chores like vacuuming, scrubbing, lawn mowing etc? I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sure we can go very far if we are flexible with the initial design. Then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; let's see how well the &quot;genetic agorithms&quot; do with improving the design
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; over time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course, by designing everything to fit the machines it can be made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trivial (actually not even then, but anyway) to run an automated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; village. However, it might not be entirely pleasant to live in such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place since it will not be designed for human chaos. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problems one should think of carefully before setting up something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like this is: what are you trying to achieve? Is this solution brittle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and overplanned? Here in Sweden we have many buildings from the 30's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; created by progressive functionalists that had a lot of apparently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great ideas about the house as a machine for living in. Unfortunately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they ignored social realities, and all the helpful automation and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems they had added went unused.
</EM><BR>
<P>Speaking of Sweden...have you been to Vasteras? I have read that they have
<BR>
a heating system under the streets to melt the snow. Does it work
<BR>
well? That is an example of an automated system to substitute for human.
<BR>
Not unpleasant or chaotic (if it works). And how about &quot;moving sidewalks&quot;,
<BR>
another example of automation. In fact the whole internal transportation
<BR>
system could be automated ... safe, pollution-free. Villages designed this
<BR>
way could be linked by inter-village transportation methods, also safe and
<BR>
pollution-free. People can leave their cars on the city perimeter.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Genetic algorithms would likely turn the village into a nicely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dangerous and chaotic place. After all, you can never be entirely sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the robots will be doing the right thing, and occasionally (likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite often) unanticipated quirks will appear. When other robots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encounter these quirks their quirks will also be activated, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resulting co-ecolution might lead to something very much different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the efficient all-automated village originally enticipated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Why is that half of the garden so unkempt? Well, our first lawnmower
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparently had a mutation that made it avoid it. Then our neighbour's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mower instead began to mowe it, and everything was fine for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while. Unfortunately it was rather &quot;aggressive&quot;, running into any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mower that came close, but it did a great job. After a few months our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mowers learned never to go there. But then the neighbour's mower had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an upgrade and only tended its part of the garden, and our mowers have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long since bred out any genes that make them mowe that part. So we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tried introducing some new ones, but they mowed my rosebushes, earning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lot of negative fitness, and the other mowers prevented them from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going into the unmowed area since they had learned that overall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fitness decreased when one of them got there and was ejected. So after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a while we were left again with mowers that refused to mowe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; half. Now we are planning to buy some lawnmower herder robots - we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hope they can fix it.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>It could get pretty nighmarish if the humans who start the GA's off don't
<BR>
put them on the right path.
<BR>
