<P>Some people, yes.  You and I, definitely.  The stereotypical African

villager, probably not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Unlimited production does not mean immediately infinite supply, no

<EM>&gt; No, but once you have real &quot;almost anything&quot; boxes, you do get to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;infinite supply&quot; position for most human needs relatively quickly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is only a matter of days to give everyone alive an AA box.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is obvious if you think about the doubling times.  The mass doubling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; times for AA boxes are of the order of hours.  The mass doubling times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for humans are of the order of months to years.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, so you have more AA boxes than there are people on Earth.  And let's
<BR>
say you can ship these boxes to every person - a challenge, perhaps, but
<BR>
not insurmountable.  How do you:
<BR>
* get everyone's attention long enough to inform them of what an AA box
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is
<BR>
* convince every person that an AA box is worth having
<BR>
* communicate to every person how to use the AA box (even if you just
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have to put on a headband and imagine the desired object, you still
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have to know to put on the headband first)
<BR>
<P>Granted, if one makes a halfway decent effort to meet these challenges,
<BR>
then being a &quot;have not&quot; becomes unarguably voluntary from the point of
<BR>
view of the &quot;haves&quot;.  But if one remains poor and ignorant, one may well
<BR>
believe that there is no way out, despite the fact that a way out is
<BR>
repeatedly offered, maybe even shoved in one's face...and one still
<BR>
starves.
<BR>
<P>If, as will likely be the result, some people have AA boxes and others
<BR>
don't, then you will still see some human beings dealing with limited
<BR>
resources - not the upper class by any means, but they still exist.  And
<BR>
it is therefore realistic to write about such characters, even in a
<BR>
world which has AA boxes.
