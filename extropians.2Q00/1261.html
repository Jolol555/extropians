<P>My point is that the cops in New York City are permitted to use
<BR>
bullets the general public cannot use -- the so-called &quot;cop killer&quot;
<BR>
bullets -- despite their patrolling streets packed with large numbers
<BR>
of innocent bystanders.  I find it disturbing in the extreme that in
<BR>
New York the average citizen is essentially completely disarmed, but
<BR>
hardly any weapon is too lethal for a cop walking the beat.  I'm not
<BR>
making any claims about the so-called &quot;cop killer&quot; bullets, except to
<BR>
note the irony of the cops using them after the public had been told
<BR>
how horrible they are.
<BR>
<P>A few years ago an undercover transit cop (a division of the NYPD that
<BR>
used to patrol the subways -- I believe they've since merged into the
<BR>
regular force) was saved by his bulletproof vest from fellow officers
<BR>
who saw him draw his gun on a suspect and began shooting him (mostly
<BR>
in the back).  The case made the transit police look particularly bad
<BR>
since it seemed the officers may have assumed that the undercover cop
<BR>
was a wrongdoer due to his race.  I think he sued the city
<BR>
successfully for many millions.  Subsequently the cops have shifted to
<BR>
the so-called &quot;cop killer&quot; bullets.  I guess today the undercover cop
<BR>
would be dead.
