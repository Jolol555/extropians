<P>&lt;&lt; But it's quite difficult to know how to predict fascism. A lot
<BR>
&nbsp;of studies were done after WWII, though, which shed some light
<BR>
&nbsp;on the matter. There are certainly some disturbing signs among
<BR>
&nbsp;members of Extropians (but, of course, it's not clear how less
<BR>
&nbsp;present such signs would be on any other list): a VERY strong
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality, strong resentment towards groups
<BR>
&nbsp;thought to have more power than they deserve (environmentalists,
<BR>
&nbsp;Jews, feminists, etc., etc., etc. -- the circumcision
<BR>
&nbsp;discussions are always good for a laugh: no, no, seriously,
<BR>
&nbsp;these ZOG minions -- or would that be &quot;minion&quot;?... -- can
<BR>
&nbsp;certainly be annoying; but the point about the danger manifest
<BR>
&nbsp;in the reaction is _attitude_, not _content_).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;The danger is particularly great among a group that generally
<BR>
&nbsp;doesn't believe in the irrational (in the Freudian, not
<BR>
&nbsp;cognitive or neuro-psychological sense), in part because such a
<BR>
&nbsp;group generally won't agree with, or understand the force of,
<BR>
&nbsp;the point above about the irrelevance of doctrinal content.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Speaking of Italy and Russia, I'm thinking of the end of Buber's
<BR>
&nbsp;anti-Marxist book, _Paths in Utopia_: I think the risk, if not
<BR>
&nbsp;underbelly, of Extropianism is &quot;Rome&quot;; elements of the WTA:
<BR>
&nbsp;perhaps &quot;Moscow&quot;; the alternative? Well, probably not Jerusalem,
<BR>
&nbsp;as Buber predicted... -- let's say Stockholm.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;On the other hand, any attmpt to articulate an alternative, to
<BR>
&nbsp;take a stand against elements of contemporary society, creates a
<BR>
&nbsp;risk: &quot;Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;And saying more with less (also known as &quot;negative dialectics&quot;)
<BR>
&nbsp;may not minimize the risk much, except insofar as it lapses into
<BR>
&nbsp;quietism (i.e. to be Hamlet or not-Hamlet).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Goodward!
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;(Pardon typos) &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>My take on this is more direct. Lay a veneer of futurism or libertarianism 
<BR>
upon racist attitudes and it still does not alter the content. It is merely 
<BR>
an attempt to make it more palatable, more salable. I used Marv Minsky as an 
<BR>
example some weeks ago regarding this thread. If Marvin is exterminated, 
<BR>
would the multitudes then massively, fund, Extropian interests? Nope. So then 
<BR>
one could then likely, assume that people who held the cog v zog mentality, 
<BR>
had already racist views before linking up with Extropianism. Furthermore, 
<BR>
since zog is a term extracted from the 1980's hitlerite fantasy, The Turner 
<BR>
Diaries, the people who identify, ideologically with this tract, have already 
<BR>
flown the hankenkrauz (so to speak) and whatever other interests they pursue 
<BR>
is secondary.
