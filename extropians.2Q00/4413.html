After I received an email from another list member, it occurred to that it
<BR>
had been a while since my introduction (Jan, 2000) and some people might not
<BR>
remember who I am or might even be newer to this list than I am... so I
<BR>
decided to post my reply to the list as well:

<EM>&gt; It appears as if Loree Thomas &lt;<A HREF="mailto:loreetg@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20A%20father%20and%20a%20woman?&In-Reply-To=&lt;006c01bfcf3e$2801ecc0$0200a8c0@kathie&gt;">loreetg@yahoo.com</A>&gt; wrote:

<EM>&gt; |Amara... As both a father AND a woman... I give you MY permission to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |celebrate in any fashion you want.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Elaborate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok... A little bit of Feminist Theory first.
<BR>
<P>Biological sex and gender are considered to be two seperate things.
<BR>
Biological sex is determined (for the most part) by your chomosones...
<BR>
specifically the xx or xy.  We use the words &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; as sex
<BR>
designators.  We won't go into the possible variations and anomalies, but
<BR>
for all intents and purposes there are two sexes, male and female, with a
<BR>
few individuals that are neither one or the other but some combination.  The
<BR>
mixed sex individuals are usually (but not always) sterile.
<BR>
<P>Gender, OTOH, is considered to be a social construct... a series of roles,
<BR>
expectations actions and attitudes that vary from culture to culture and
<BR>
within a culture through time.  We use the words &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; as gender
<BR>
designators.
<BR>
<P>Ok... seems those crazy feminists got somethings right after all.
<BR>
<P>Gender is a fuzzy concept, with no clearly defined borders... which is why
<BR>
we can talk about one person being more or less of a man (or woman) than
<BR>
another.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have had the impression that a ``father'' implied a male while a
</EM><BR>
``woman''
<BR>
<EM>&gt; implied a female, and that a human cannot be both a male and female at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same time.
</EM><BR>
<P>So you see, your confusion is a result of a mispercieved identity between a
<BR>
sex (female) and a gender (woman).
<BR>
<P>Just to further confuse things... there are different types of gender.
<BR>
Internal gender (which appears to be set in the womb and unchangable)
<BR>
expressed gender (what you choose to show the outside world) and percieved
<BR>
gender (what the world sees when it looks at you).  Except for internal
<BR>
gender, these attributes can change over time or even vary depending on the
<BR>
culture of the person doing the observing.
<BR>
<P>I am one of those rare (about 0.01% of the population) and strange people
<BR>
who was born with an internal gender that didn't match my sex.  For years, I
<BR>
was forced (first by my parents and then by social pressure) into expressing
<BR>
a gender consistent with my birth sex... but I was never really good at it.
<BR>
So I became a somewhat efeminate male.  Being as I am also bi-sexual, and a
<BR>
certain type of woman (sane) finds efeminate males attractive, I had no
<BR>
problem finding a spouse (I've had 3) or having kids (3 also).  I expressed
<BR>
my real gender mostly in the privacy of our bedroom... or the occasional
<BR>
night out at a queer disco in drag.
<BR>
<P>My oldest is now 16, my youngest 10.  About 4 years ago, my ex decided she
<BR>
needed a &quot;real man&quot; and moved in with my best friend.  This led to a
<BR>
divorce... and since my  ex also decided she now really wanted to be a
<BR>
mother (she hadn't been up to that point... I had done all the normal fem
<BR>
stuff around the house since our marriage) she fought for (and won) custody
<BR>
of our kids.
<BR>
<P>Social restrictions on alternative gender expressions have relaxed quite a
<BR>
bit recently.  I started outwardly expressing, with both clothes and
<BR>
mannerisms, my real gender.  After a year of living as a woman 24 hrs a day
<BR>
7 days a week I decided to alter my body using current medical technology
<BR>
(transhumanism at work!) to make it align more closely with my actual
<BR>
gender.
<BR>
<P>I've now been on hormone replacement therapy for 2.5 years... and there
<BR>
isn't much of my body that still looks male.
<BR>
<P>So yes.  I AM both a woman and a father.
<BR>
<P>Hugs,
<BR>
Loree
