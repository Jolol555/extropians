<EM>&gt; For those who've read it what do you think of Egan' 'Dust

<EM>&gt; Theory' espoused in the book?
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that there are problems with the peculiar &quot;takeover of reality&quot;
<BR>
effect Egan shows as happening with the dust theory.  But the thing
<BR>
that really bothered me about the book was the manner in which the dust
<BR>
theory was originated within the story.  The guy who came up with it
<BR>
did so on the basis of personal experience.  It has been a long time
<BR>
since I read the story so I no longer remember the details.  I wonder
<BR>
if someone could summarize what his personal experience was that made
<BR>
him believe the dust theory was true.
