<P>
<EM>&gt;Sorry Brian. Gotta say this. Then I'm unsubscribing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Imagine Brian is a woman, Brianna.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Imagine Natasha is a man, Nathan.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Imagine Max is a woman, Maxine.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;wha...?&quot;  Harv stares incredulously at the monitor.  He slaps the 
<BR>
side of his iMac to clear the display, but it doesn't help.  He tried 
<BR>
ROT-13, but the display is still garbled.  He tries PGP.  He tries 
<BR>
fractal algorithms.  Nothing helps.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This really helps see what's happening with Max's machismo blow-up.
</EM><BR>
<P>Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the Help Center launches.  &quot;I don't 
<BR>
need help,&quot; Harv complains to the monitor while hitting the 
<BR>
close-window key to no avail.  &quot;Help never helped anybody.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But some background is really needed too.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then the desktop pattern disappeared, leaving Harv staring into a 
<BR>
black expansive of void.  &quot;Uh oh...&quot;  He didn't move.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Go back a few months
</EM><BR>
<P>His eyes flick nervously to look at the menu clock which has begun 
<BR>
racing backward in time like an H.G.Wells applet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(Fast Forward a few months.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Then, just as inexplicably, it starts racing forward.  Harv slowly 
<BR>
starts inching his hand toward the mouse.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Brianna[....]
</EM><BR>
<P>An icon appears on the screen as Harv grabs the mouse.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Maxine[....]
</EM><BR>
<P>Another icon appears on the opposite side of the screen as Harv's 
<BR>
other hand reaches for the keyboard.  The icons slowly start circling 
<BR>
around the screen like two boxers in the ring.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  ('racist', 'misogynist', etc.).
</EM><BR>
<P>Random words start spewing out of the voice synthesizer modules.  &quot;Oh 
<BR>
no you don't,&quot; Harv exclaims as he frantically tries to launch Virex.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Brianna
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;Stan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maxine
</EM><BR>
<P>More icons are appearing behind the original icons.  There seem to be 
<BR>
two groups forming, opposing each other.  Harv starts right-clicking 
<BR>
icons to scan them, but they are appearing faster than he can point 
<BR>
and click.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Brianna
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;Pauline Borsok
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maxine
</EM><BR>
<P>More icons appear at a furious rate.  Harv is sweeping whole segments 
<BR>
of the screen and hitting function keys.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A long time goes by.
</EM><BR>
<P>He has no idea how long this goes on.  For every icon he squashes, 
<BR>
hundreds more appear.  They are shooting at each other like Space 
<BR>
Invaders gone mad.  Harv almost thinks that under the random voice 
<BR>
synthesized babbling he can here the almost forgotten words:  &quot;Stop 
<BR>
the Invaders!  Kill the humanoids!&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;emails [....] odd emails [....]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Zip from Maxine [....]
</EM><BR>
<P>The Internet control panel shows that messages are flowing in and out 
<BR>
of his system at a phenomenal rate.  Some of the bug-like icons have 
<BR>
crawled out of the screen and are now crawling down the USB cable 
<BR>
toward Harv's Zip Drive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Fast forward to June 2000.
</EM><BR>
<P>The clock stops its nauseating cycle.  &quot;How can this be happening?&quot; 
<BR>
Harv wails, still clicking with one hand and typing with the other. 
<BR>
&quot;We killed all of the Y2K bugs in the last millenium!  This is the 
<BR>
logical paradise of the future!  How can 21st century hardware have 
<BR>
the same communications problems as the 20th century?&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Brianna
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maxine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Brianna
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maxine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nathan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Brianna
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maxine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nathan
</EM><BR>
<P>More icons are appearing.  Just as the Y2K bugs are about to reach 
<BR>
the Zip Drive, Harv reaches over in desperation and yanks the USB 
<BR>
cable out of its socket.  Instantaneously, the Y2K bugs along the 
<BR>
cable promptly vanish.  The Millenium logo appears on his screen.  It 
<BR>
is a snake feeding on its own tail.  In a similar manner, it seems to 
<BR>
be feeding the hoard of swarming Y2K bugs that are raging a civil war 
<BR>
of consipiracy on his screen.  He hears Frank Black saying &quot;my voice 
<BR>
is my password.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Nathan then disappears.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*Maxine* then attacks Brianna!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Extropians join in!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Earth to Extropians: Anyone understand yet?
</EM><BR>
<P>A look of understanding crosses Harv's face.  He lets go of the Zip 
<BR>
Drive cable, and then reaches over for the Internet cable.  He yanks 
<BR>
it out of the wall while the remaining icons disappear with a 
<BR>
deafening howl.  The Millennium logo fades lastly, as if it were 
<BR>
never there at all.  The room is echoing in the silence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;P.S. This way of looking at things was someone else's idea, for the record.
</EM><BR>
<P>Harv suddenly wakes up with a jerk.  He wipes the drool off the side 
<BR>
of his face, and feels the indentions the keyboard has made on his 
<BR>
face.  He stares a moment uncomprehendingly at the normal-looking 
<BR>
screen.  The single window shows Spike's posted suggestions that we 
<BR>
should gang up and mock anti-Extropian posts made to the list.
<BR>
<P>&quot;That didn't make any sense at all,&quot; Harv mutters.
<BR>
<P>After a pause, he picks up a half finished bottle of Sobe all-natural 
<BR>
juice beverage and tilts the bottle to read the label.  &quot;New improved 
<BR>
formula my ass!&quot;  He slams the unfinished bottle into a waste 
<BR>
receptacle.  Some of the liquid splatters on the outside where 
<BR>
droplets ooze down the side leaving trails of color through the 
<BR>
Windows recycle logo.  Harv staggers off to look for something 
<BR>
alcoholic to drink
