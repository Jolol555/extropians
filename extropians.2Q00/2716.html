<P>
Fuck.
<BR>
<P>Just when I'm at the top of my game as futurist bully, boldly smashing
<BR>
through the entropic resistance and taking no prisoners, a small piece
<BR>
of news utterly deflates my soul.
<BR>
<P>The few hours I have been privileged to spend with Sasha were a rare
<BR>
opportunity to be with someone who not only understood my strangest
<BR>
ideas, but understood them instantly and immediately took their
<BR>
consequences even further, challenging me to keep up.  Philosophical
<BR>
discussions with Sasha were like playing chess with a grandmaster to
<BR>
improve your own game.
<BR>
<P>I hope that if I live 1000 years I will be able to contribute to the
<BR>
human and transhuman condition half as much as he has contributed to
<BR>
me and his other memetic progeny in his few short decades.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
