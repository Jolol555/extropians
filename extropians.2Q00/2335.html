<EM>&gt; You don't need to 'rewind the real world' to reverse a computation. All you

<EM>&gt; need to do is reverse the data manipulation that was done inside your

<EM>&gt; computer. It doesn't matter whether those bits represented data in a VR,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sensory input from the physical world, short-term memory inside the upload's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind, or anything else you want to use them for. The physical mechanism is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same in any case, and so are the limits on what can and can not be done.

<P>Robin has a paper on the topic of robots who try to use reversible
<BR>
computing.  My understanding was that there are unavoidable costs
<BR>
due to the non-reversible nature of the world, as the robot senses and
<BR>
interacts with it.  In a fully virtual world you could reverse the world
<BR>
and save energy.  It's probably not a very big effect, though.

<P>: Abstract
<BR>
:
<BR>
: A computer's task is often taken to be that of starting with some input,
<BR>
: grinding for a while, and eventually returning an output.  Remarkably,
<BR>
: all such tasks can be accomplished &quot;reversibly&quot;, with an arbitrarily
<BR>
: low intrinsic entropy cost, and in reasonable space and time relative
<BR>
: to irreversible approaches.
<BR>
:
<BR>
: Artificial intelligence computation, however, does not fit well into an
<BR>
: input-grind-output format. &quot;Reversible agents&quot; should run indefinitely,
<BR>
: observing their world, acting to achieve goals, and talking with other
<BR>
: autonomous agents. Do these additional requirements introduce more
<BR>
: intrinsic entropy costs for such agents?
<BR>
:
<BR>
: This preliminary survey suggests that they do. Goal states can unavoidably
<BR>
: have lower entropy than initial states. Sensing costs, when features of
<BR>
: the world relevant to an agent's analysis change unpredictably before
<BR>
: the agent has time to reverse that analysis. On the other hand, talk
<BR>
: between nearby agents can be cheap.
