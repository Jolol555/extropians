<EM>&gt; &gt;The ABA is a government supported monopoly.  Without the government to
</EM><BR>
back
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;its power, it would face serious competition from law clinics (which it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;already does in some states of the US*), unlicensed lawyers, etc.  See,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;e.g., _The Rule of Experts: Occupational Licensing in America_ by S.
</EM><BR>
David
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Young for other examples of businesses that use the government to avoid
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;market.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;* Recently, the law clinic at some Louisiana law school was banned from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;helping people unless the people being helped could prove they made less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;than some minimum income standard.  The reason?  People were using the
</EM><BR>
law
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;clinic to sue one of the governor's supporters over, I believe, some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;pollution issue.  The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that this was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;practicing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;law without a license -- except in the case of the indigent.  In other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;words, the court protected the monopoly privilige of lawyers from an
</EM><BR>
actual
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;competitor.  (I believe this was on either &quot;60 Minutes&quot; a few months
</EM><BR>
ago.)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's not really a &quot;monopoly.&quot;  The ABA does not have the exclusive right
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; practice law.  The ABA in fact does not practice law.  It is merely a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; professional association of unrelated individuals who are licensed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practice law.  It just so happens that the practice of law requires a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; license in every state in the union.  But that does not mean that lawyers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are exercising a monopoly any more than contractors, engineers, architects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or physicians or any other profession which you need a license in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legally practice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Saying that lawyers have a &quot;monopoly&quot; on the practice of law is like
</EM><BR>
saying
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that licensed drivers have a monopoly on driving.
</EM><BR>
<P>Licensing drivers is similar, but not the same.
<BR>
<P>Howso?  The ABA, like the AMA controls the number of seats in accredited law
<BR>
schools and also has input into the licensing process in each state as well
<BR>
as into the disbarring of members.  This gives it far more power than a mere
<BR>
professional organization like, say, the American Philosophical Association.
<BR>
<P>Licensing drivers is not the same in that one can learn to drive anywhere
<BR>
and the various driving schools do not control what's in the tests.  Nor do
<BR>
they have power of revoking licenses.
<BR>
<P>This is not to say I agree with licensing drivers.  I do not.  Under a full
<BR>
privatization of roads (&quot;a&quot; and not &quot;the&quot; because there are many ways to do
<BR>
this), I'm sure, some critieria would arise for allowing people to drive on
<BR>
roads, though I doubt it would be close to current driver licensing
<BR>
practises.  Nor do I think people would lose their driving priviliges on a
<BR>
given road or association of roads for the same reasons as they lose them
<BR>
currently.
<BR>
<P>Later!
