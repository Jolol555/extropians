<P>&lt; I posted a message including a question I was
<BR>
<EM>&gt;pondering:  Are there people who've undergone such radical personality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;changes that they wouldn't enjoy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  being with their former selves?
</EM><BR>
<P>Reluctantly I admit that that's me.  About 10 years ago I was still a 
<BR>
dogmatic fundamentalist Christian, quick to dismiss any idea contrary to the 
<BR>
strict conventional interpretation of scripture as heresy.  I voluntarily 
<BR>
incarcerated myself in the prison of living according to the ethics and 
<BR>
morals handed down by centuries of Christian orthodoxy, as opposed to what I 
<BR>
felt worked for me.  My mind was completely closed to any theory, idea or 
<BR>
mindset which was not contained within the 66 books of the Holy Bible.  Many 
<BR>
of my friends and family are still fundies and when I see the closed 
<BR>
mindedness they exhibit, it reminds me of myself of 10 years ago, and it 
<BR>
sickens me.  Today I would definitely *not* be found hanging out with the 
<BR>
Zero of ~1990.
