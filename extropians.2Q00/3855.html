<P><P>TENERIFE and PORTO DE LA CRUZ
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of the island is about 700.000 of which about
<BR>
210.000
<BR>
live in the capital city Santa Cruz, situated on the north-west coast of
<BR>
the island. Tenerife (as well as the other Canarian Islands) is partly
<BR>
tax-free zone. The main source of livelihood of Tenerife is the tourism
<BR>
industry: more than four million tourists visit the island every year.
<BR>
Tourism has very long traditions in Tenerife, the first tourists came
<BR>
from England in the 1880's!  There is some agriculture too: vegetables,
<BR>
fruit and flowers. The most important cultivated plant is banana
<BR>
[platano]. A Tenerifean banana is quite different from its distant
<BR>
cousin the Chiquita banana. A platano is short and plump. The colour of
<BR>
the fruit flesh is darker yellow and the taste much more delicious.
<BR>
There can be hundreds of thousands of banana plants on one plantation.
<BR>
They also make licquer of the bananas on the island.  Another important
<BR>
plant is the grapevine. The rich volcanic soil and mild climate give the
<BR>
wine its own unique aroma. In Tenerife there are as many as five
<BR>
&quot;Denomination of Origen (DO)&quot; vineyards: Abona, Tacoronte-Acentejo,
<BR>
Valle de Guimar, Valle de la Orotava and Ycoden-Daute-Isora. The largest
<BR>
of these is Tacoronte-Acentejo, area 1.200 hectares. The production in
<BR>
1997 was 1.553.000 kgs grapes.  The most cultivated brands of grape are
<BR>
the white Listan Blanco, Malvasia and Marmajuelo, the red Listan Negro
<BR>
and Negramoll.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two airports on the island. The international airport
<BR>
Reina
<BR>
Sofia (Tenerife Sur TFS) in the south near Playa de las Americas where
<BR>
most of the international flights land. The other airport Los Rodeos
<BR>
(Tenerife Norte TFN) is in the north near La Laguna. Los Rodeos serves
<BR>
mainly domestic flights.  The distance from Reina Sofia to Playa de las
<BR>
Americas is about 20 kms and the trip takes about 20 mins, to Puerto de
<BR>
la Cruz about 100 km and takes about 90 mins. Tenerife is dominated by
<BR>
the highest mountain in Spain, the volcano Teide, the often snow covered
<BR>
summit of which reaches the altitude of 3.717 meters. El Teide is not a
<BR>
dormant volcano! The last (though minor) eruption took place in the
<BR>
beginning of this century. The last disasterous eruption happened in the
<BR>
year 1706.  The southern part of the island is very infertile and next
<BR>
to nothing grows without artificial irrigation. The southern resorts
<BR>
Playa de las Americas and Los Cristianos have been built for tourism
<BR>
only and there is no local settlement. The prices there are distinctly
<BR>
higher than in the Capital City or Puerto de la Cruz. But the best
<BR>
beaches are on the southern coast and the sunshine is best counted on
<BR>
there. The newcomer among the resorts of Tenerife is the small and
<BR>
peaceful Los Gigantes on the west coast. In the northern parts of the
<BR>
island the nature is quite different from the southern nature. The
<BR>
clouds arriving from north don't always have the strength to clear the
<BR>
mountain but pour their rain north of the mountain. Due to these showers
<BR>
the flora is unbelievably rich and breathtakingly beautiful. That is why
<BR>
Puerto de la Cruz is often called the City of Eternal Spring. The best
<BR>
time to travel to Tenerife is February.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puerto de la Cruz was founded in the beginning of the 17th
<BR>
century.
<BR>
Originally it was called Puerto de la Orotava. A big harbour was built
<BR>
there and the city became an important centre of commerce and
<BR>
navigation. The most important export articles until the 19th century
<BR>
were sugar and wine. Nowadays the main source of livelihood of Puerto de
<BR>
la Cruz is tourism. Despite of mass tourism Puerto is still a genuine
<BR>
Canarian town with about 35.000 natives living there.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The island of Tenerife was born 10 million years ago as a result
<BR>
of an
<BR>
underwater landslide and a volcanic eruption. The first of the Canary
<BR>
Islands were born the same way some 20 million years ago. The island was
<BR>
conquered from the natives, the Guanches, to Spain by Andalusian Alonso
<BR>
Fernandez Lugo and his troops in the year 1496. The origin of the
<BR>
Guanches is still a mystery to the anthropologists because they were
<BR>
tall, blond and blue-eyed. Furthermore there is no proof of their boat
<BR>
making skills and obviously they couldn't even swim! You can familiarize
<BR>
yourself with the history of the Guanches in Museo Etnografico in La
<BR>
Orotava or in Santa Cruz in Museo Arqueologico where you can meet a
<BR>
Guanche in person - as a mummy. Tenerife is the largest of the Canary
<BR>
Islands.
