<EM>&gt; &gt; Odds are, since nanotech will be even *more* dangerous than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nuclear weapons,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; access to it will be guarded just as tightly as nuclear weapon access is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; now.  Have you tried to buy a nuclear weapon lately?  Is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reason that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cannot because you live under the thumb of an authoritarian government?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The examples are not parallel.  Nuclear weapons aren't very useful for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything except blowing people up, so it is easy to keep the number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;potential manufacturers small and restrict their activities.
</EM><BR>
<P>So are you suggesting that, if nukes were handy for many other things 
<BR>
besides huge explosions, you'd be able to buy them at your local Radio 
<BR>
Shack?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Nanotech, OTOH, is incredibly useful for just about everything imaginable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It would be extremely difficult to prevent its use from spreading to every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;major industry on the planet in short order, and once you reach that point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there are far too many people with assemblers for a government to easily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;keep track of them all.
</EM><BR>
<P>So do you think government is stupid enough to avoid regulation of nanotech 
<BR>
until *after* everybody already has a near-anything device?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And, of course, this doesn't even count the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that I don't need to own an assembler to reap the benefits of nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, but without access to one of your very own, you would be limited to 
<BR>
making only what the owner of the device would allow you to make.  So yes, I 
<BR>
guess one way to deal with the threat would be to only allow government to 
<BR>
own the devices and then require the rest of us to line up welfare style to 
<BR>
put in our construction requests.  If that is more acceptable to you than 
<BR>
surveillance, I suppose I could live with that.
