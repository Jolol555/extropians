<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; It might seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  arrogant, but our system of laws is by far superior to that of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the UK or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  US. We have ended the era of court law about five hundred
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; years ago when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  Emperor Karl V compiled a code of laws for the Holy Roman Empire.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; I hope I'll have the time to discuss this at more length with you soon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Suffice it to say that I don't agree with you.  I've had fairly extensive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; experience with civil code legal systems, and obviously quite a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; bit in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Anglo-American system of common law.  Generally, I find the civil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; code system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; less flexible and much less amenable to a general atmosphere of rapid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; innovation than the common law system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Well, that might seem this way at first, but I have great problems with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  anglo-saxon system of common law. I will never  get used to explaining in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  each contract each little bit of right I wish to cease or get. And besides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that the codes of law are abstract in a way that allows for them to be used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  in any relationship. Besides that the German law knows the common law or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  court law. It has been applied in certain cases and some of them have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  prevailed until today and are part of the legal system by now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  It would be interesting for me to know where you had your experience with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  civel code legal systems, as there are great differences between the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  European law systems, though this tends to diminish due to the European
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Community's Civil Code of Laws.
</EM><BR>
<P>My experience has mainly been with Mexico.  I've had a number of cases that 
<BR>
have had strong connections to Mexico.  I've been fortunate to work with some 
<BR>
very prominent legal practitioners and scholars in Mexico and to have had the 
<BR>
opportunity to work on one very large case (that worked its way through the 
<BR>
US appeals courts twice and, ultimately to the US Supreme Court) involving 
<BR>
deep comparative law issues between the US and Mexican system on both a 
<BR>
private and state-to-state basis.  Because of some of the arcane issues in 
<BR>
that case, Mexican counsel on both sides were required to look to European 
<BR>
civil law sources and commentators on a number of occasions and comparative 
<BR>
juridical methodology became central to decision of the case.  A couple of 
<BR>
years ago I worked on a case that had some connection with Dutch law and 
<BR>
practice and worked with some attorneys in Amsterdam a bit.  Oh, and of 
<BR>
course, living in Texas, I practice next to the only state in the union that 
<BR>
continues its theoretical adherence to code methodology, Louisiana (although 
<BR>
the reality has become a pretty humorous complete translation of the code 
<BR>
process into common law practice).  On the other side of the great divide in 
<BR>
Western legal systems, my practice has been closely tied to the London bar 
<BR>
for years, and I've had occasion to work with solicitors and barristers  in 
<BR>
many cases.  With that background I feel as competent as any non-academic 
<BR>
practitioner to make observations about the two systems.
<BR>
<P>As you correctly point out, neither system is &quot;pure&quot;, in the sense that 
<BR>
modern code jurisdictions have all adopted some decisional matrix around 
<BR>
their statutory core, and all of the common law systems have recognized the 
<BR>
value of codifications, both in works like the Restatements and also in 
<BR>
positive law, such as in the UCC.  However, the life and practice of the law 
<BR>
remains very, very different in the two worlds of western law, as my 
<BR>
colleagues in England are discovering to their great pain as they attempt to 
<BR>
accommodate EU practices.
<BR>
<P>With that preamble, and without meaning to be combative, I would have to 
<BR>
summarize my critique of the code systems as being premised on a conceit of 
<BR>
control that is inconsistent with the kind of flexibility that has suited the 
<BR>
Anglo-American world so well in the age of innovation.  The notion that a 
<BR>
legislature can define a complete set of rules by which people should be 
<BR>
governed is inimical to change and experimentation.  I know that all the code 
<BR>
systems have &quot;meta-rules&quot; that attempt to address this problem, and the 
<BR>
adoption of decisional jurisprudential rule-making as an adjunct to the 
<BR>
central body of codified positive law has significantly ameliorated this 
<BR>
problem.  But the core notion that a set &quot;operating system&quot; for society can 
<BR>
be determined on a fine-grained level lies at the foundation of many of the 
<BR>
evils free people have encountered since the West has come to embrace the 
<BR>
notion of the rule of law.
<BR>
<P>The ad-hoc and highly contextual nature of the common law grows out of a very 
<BR>
different premise about the governance of society than the one that underlies 
<BR>
the code system.  Yes, code practitioners find it frustrating that we define 
<BR>
rights and obligations so specifically in our contracts.  But that's the 
<BR>
price we pay for the extreme flexibility of our legal system.  Code lawyers 
<BR>
shrink back in horror at the miles of bookshelves in a well-stocked common 
<BR>
law library, and the complex system of indices required to make any sense of 
<BR>
that great mass of mumbling judges.  But in that complexity we find 
<BR>
fertility, like a rich ecosystem.  To continue the metaphor, the code system 
<BR>
looks to me like a dangerously narrow monoculture, exposed to the risk of 
<BR>
destruction from every new pathogen or foreign creature that might wander 
<BR>
into its territory.  The rich confusion of the common law contains a great 
<BR>
reservoir of social DNA from which new solutions can be crafted on the fly, 
<BR>
while the whole system can maintain equilibrium.  
<BR>
<P>Of course, taking Jefferson's metaphor of federalism as &quot;the laboratories of 
<BR>
democracy&quot;, the great comparative law exercise we're all living in in the 
<BR>
West will ultimately yield some answers.  The Anglo-American world has gone 
<BR>
down one road, and the rest of the world has gone down another.  History will 
<BR>
eventually offer up some results.
