<P><EM>&gt;The predominate method of food production used these days requires an

(including the manufacture, shipping, and operation of farm equipment &amp; the

manufacture, shipping, and handling of fertilisers and pesticides, the
<BR>
figure's between 3 and 5 calories input for every 1 calorie obtained--and I
<BR>
apologize for not having references for these figures handy.  I'm looking
<BR>
through my stuff trying to find some).

<EM>&gt;This is not good economics. It's a lousy technology...

<P>Apologies in advance if I'm missing your point, but the above sounds like
<BR>
sophistry.  In terms of economic value, a calorie from fossil fuel doesn't
<BR>
inherently equal a calorie from food, nor does a calorie from wheat
<BR>
neccessarily equal a calorie from corn, etc.  There's a lot of grass in my
<BR>
back yard, full of calories, but I'd sure have trouble eating it.  And even
<BR>
if I could eat it, I'd sure have trouble enjoying it.  I'd much rather
<BR>
&quot;waste&quot; a bunch of calories by passing the grass through a deer and then
<BR>
eating the deer.
<BR>
<P>Sure, perhaps food production could be done more efficiently, and maybe you
<BR>
have an argument for that.  But to merely compare calories between fossil
<BR>
fuels and food is a really bad argument.

The Beyond outside us is indeed swept away, and the

great undertaking of the Enlightenment complete; 
<BR>
but the Beyond *inside* us has become a new heaven 
<BR>
and calls us to renewed heaven-storming.
