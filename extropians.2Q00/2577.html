<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Death to 7 of 9, the Borg, Data, and Spock, proud upholders of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; frickin' *stupid* tradition that intelligent people are supposed to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; unable to understand emotions.  Hail Gene Roddenbury, who managed to
</EM><BR>
do
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; more damage to American rationality than, well, just about anyone.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, Spock was not originally supposed to be emotionless.  In the first
<BR>
pilot &quot;The Menagerie&quot; also seen as flashbacks in &quot;The Cage&quot;, Spock smiles
<BR>
when he finds the plant with leaves humming in the wind.
<BR>
<P>Two things led to the development of Spock.
<BR>
<P>Firstly, the NBC executives cut the female commander &quot;Number One&quot; out of the
<BR>
show.  She was going to counter the Captains's testosterone by trying to
<BR>
think through problems instead of fighting through them; supposedly a
<BR>
woman's point of view.  With her character cut from the show, it fell to
<BR>
Spock, as first officer, to try to advise the captain with reason to balance
<BR>
the military aspect of command.
<BR>
<P>Secondly, people seeing the pilot being shot thought that Spock was comical.
<BR>
They thought he was a green elfin man with pointed ears.  They expected him
<BR>
to prance around and be a fantasy-character sidekick to the captain.
<BR>
Roddenberry wanted a serious show with serious respect for nonhuman races.
<BR>
He decided that Spock needed to avoid the appearance of being funny.  He was
<BR>
supposed to remain serious and business-like, and to keep the emotions of
<BR>
the Captain in check when human instinct takes over.
<BR>
<P>Not a bad reason for the character.  Data was based on the android from &quot;The
<BR>
Questor Tapes&quot;.  As a computer, it made sense not to have emotions.  Also,
<BR>
as a computer, it made sense to have better memory and faster processing
<BR>
than humans.  Rather than claiming to be superior, as Spock often did, Data
<BR>
claimed to be inferior without emotions and sought to gain them.
<BR>
<P>Seven of Nine, tertiary adjunct to something-or-other, is a different story.
<BR>
She often seems emotional to me.  However, her Borg background is supposed
<BR>
to be hive-like, so insects don't have emotions.  It's hard to show
<BR>
non-humans, and frequently avoiding human emotions seems the way to do it.
