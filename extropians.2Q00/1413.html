<P><EM>&gt; I then asked around among the people I know who are law

<EM>&gt;  buffs, and they were all aware in considerably more detail, it seemed, of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the same material, although some of them probably fit the categories you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  indicated, for sure.  But then, Hitler liked dogs...
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't mean to suggest that the text hadn't at one time been considered as 
<BR>
an amendment to the Constitution, but rather that the interpretation seemed 
<BR>
far-fetched.  In the context of the period between the two wars with Britain, 
<BR>
it seems perfectly understandable.

<P><EM>&gt; Keep in mind Greg, that at that point in history, there had been the big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  anti-mason reactions IIRC. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, with respect, so?  Holding a title within an organization (such as the 
<BR>
masons) couldn't be the target of the proposed text, since &quot;President&quot; and 
<BR>
&quot;Congressman&quot; would also have been outlawed in such a case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Frankly I wouldn't mind if there were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  anti-trust actions taken against the bar.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I wrote before, I'm deeply ambivalent about the state sanctioning of the 
<BR>
bar.  On the other hand, as Zero Powers (Austin's little brother?) pointed 
<BR>
out, there's plenty of competition among lawyers (don't I know it!).  There's 
<BR>
certainly little or no price effect, as law schools compete like hell for 
<BR>
entrants and there's been plenty of downward pressure on legal fee rates 
<BR>
these last ten years.  I can assure you that there's no collusion to support 
<BR>
prices.  Poor people may well be underserved by the bar, but I don't know 
<BR>
that allowing anyone to hold themselves out as a lawyer would cure that.
