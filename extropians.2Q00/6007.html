<EM>&gt; That's a good question and one a lot of anarcho-capitalist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technophiles have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talked about idly from time to time - often in the context of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where to build
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Ultimate Mad Scientist Enclave.  If I understand your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question, I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the answer has to be a country like Mexico where, with enough payola, one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could buy &quot;freedom&quot; from regulation.  I've certainly seen it work in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;street economy&quot; of the Mexican cities I've spent time in.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, is that corrupt government functionaries have a nasty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; habit of not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; staying bought.  Once you start down the road of corruption and opacity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there's really no exit . . .
</EM><BR>
<P><P>True.  I think this is where N. I. Vavilov (Soviet plant geneticist who's a
<BR>
sort of a mentor of mine--I guess I'm what you'd call a posthumous
<BR>
student)made a wrong turn.  He seemed to be trying to work enough within the
<BR>
system to stay on the good side of those in power (many of his published
<BR>
papers contain references to the brilliant Soviet economy and so forth) and
<BR>
yet maintain his scientific integrity.  His actions indicate that he
<BR>
couldn't conceive of a scientist who would refuse to see the truth and
<BR>
would, in fact, deliberately falsify data in order to suck up to the guys
<BR>
controlling the food and other useful assets.
<BR>
<P>There are certain counties in northern CA whose whole economies depend on
<BR>
the cannibis trade.  The locals make very little effort to enforce anti-drug
<BR>
laws, not because they are personally paid to look the other way, but
<BR>
because EVERYone's business would suffer if the growers were seriously
<BR>
harmed.  If you could count on people's self-interest to work this way all
<BR>
the time, a bit of payola here and there, plus building up the local economy
<BR>
would keep you going; but it DOES seem to be true that there are people who
<BR>
live by the creed: &quot;If I can't have it, nobody's gonna have it,&quot; who would
<BR>
destroy or obstruct out of envy, even though such destruction and
<BR>
obstruction have negative effects on everyone's life, including their own.
<BR>
<P>I think many of the people who call themselves environmentalists fall within
<BR>
this category.  And I say this as someone who has great concern that the
<BR>
human species may be in the process of exceeding the carrying capacity of
<BR>
this planet.  The most vocal of the &quot;environmentalists&quot; are acting in ways
<BR>
that indicate they're concerned with destruction and obstruction per se
<BR>
rather than with any love of human-kind.
<BR>
<P>Back to the main subject of this post, though--I wasn't thinking of buying
<BR>
freedom.  Rather, I was thinking in terms of maintaining low profiles.
<BR>
Inefficiencies in surveillance, that sort of thing.
<BR>
