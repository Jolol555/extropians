<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm getting to like Nevada more and more, and just wish that there was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; someplace in the state that remained relatively cool in the summer. My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; body just doesn't beleive in the old 'but its a dry heat' claim...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Northern Nevada (e.g. the greater Reno/Tahoe area) doesn't get that hot in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the summer.  At my house, which is about 5,000 feet above sea level in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hills near Reno, it rarely hits 100 degrees (F) in the summer; I don't need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my air conditioner.  Most people find the environment to be quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comfortable up here. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Last time I was there was January of 1990. It sure was nice then. I had
<BR>
hit Squaw Valley on my way to NM.. skiing was fine, women were fine...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The dry heat really is much better.  For one, you don't sweat, and as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long as you drink enough water, you don't feel hot.  I've spent quite a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit of time in the desert near Tucson, AZ when it's been 120 degrees in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the shade.  Despite spending entire days doing moderate physical exercise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the open sun under those conditions (and loaded down with gear), I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always been quite comfortable, although I do consume copious amounts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; water.  Northern Nevada is much cooler than this and the summers are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generally very mild.
</EM><BR>
<P>I spent one year in Clovis NM, with two weeks being about 120-127 F (no
<BR>
air conditioning in my pickup either, so it was like driving around
<BR>
either in a sauna, or with a hair dryer on high in your face... ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One thing that I do find interesting about the Reno area is that IP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bandwidth is 10-20% cheaper than in Silicon Valley.  The number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; providers is more limited, but PVCs or fiber access is actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significantly cheaper, which is not what I would expect.
</EM><BR>
<P>Geez John, you are getting me to ask if that job offer is still open! ;)
