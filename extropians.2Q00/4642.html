<P><EM>&gt;You would think any real extropian would love to hear ways to increase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their &quot;personal extropy&quot;. Why aren't we having discussions on the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about how to be more extropian? We have sublists such as the investing-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;node where people can discuss strategies, but in general the people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on this list seem remarkably unwilling to publicly discuss or ask for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advice on ways they might improve themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>You raise an important point, Brian, but I tend to shy away from putting
<BR>
logos on people's consciousness.  We are far too complex of creatures to
<BR>
label what is and what is not with absolute rules and guidelines, even when
<BR>
it seems reasonable to do so.  Oftentimes contradictions help to propel a
<BR>
person's desire for change.  I cannot exclude a person because of one or
<BR>
more characteristics that are not completely extropian.  In fact, I welcome
<BR>
even the slightest chance of extropy in a person and encourage that growth.
<BR>
&nbsp;Why not?  Perfection is not all that historical myths have built it up to
<BR>
be and frequently welds into static holding patterns -- inertia.
<BR>
<P>To answer your question, there is a long history of posts pertaining to
<BR>
exactly what you are asking:  ways to improve one's extropy in her or his
<BR>
personal life, and I'd like to see more of it myself.  
<BR>
<P>I don't think people are unwilling to discuss or ask for advice in many
<BR>
areas, but perhaps it is a bit more difficult to publically ask for advice
<BR>
when a person is experiencing a personal problem and would prefer not to go
<BR>
public with it.  There have been times when someone has used the list for
<BR>
emotional exploitation of  personal problems which has been uncomfortable
<BR>
to many.  There has also been times when someone reached out for help with
<BR>
family and this was received very well.  Recently a person made a call to
<BR>
action to help a friend and this was handled beautifully. There have been
<BR>
many posts about smart drugs, diet, books to read, exercise, memory
<BR>
enhancement, and infertility and sexuality.  I suppose that Eli would think
<BR>
that his numerous posts on the Singularity have been helpful to many who
<BR>
have concern about superintelligent machines.  Also, posts about
<BR>
creativity, the arts and perceptions are frequently posted on this list.
<BR>
Productive and positive use of this list in dealing with desires to develop
<BR>
more extropy in life I believe is welcome, not recoiled.  Perhaps many
<BR>
people have read the articles and essays on Extropy Institute's Web site
<BR>
and other extropian sites pertaining to self-transformation and are doing
<BR>
their personal growth work privately, but this shouldn't preclude any
<BR>
public questions for improvement.  I like asking for help.
