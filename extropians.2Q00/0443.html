<EM>&gt; This is argument by anonymous authority. I don't find it persuasive.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, its argument by summary - I don't really have time to try to think
<BR>
of every argument you might possibly want to advance, especially when I'm
<BR>
taking the side that almost all of the experts are on. If you think my
<BR>
generalizations are wrong, give me a specific example of how.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;There is no plausible mechanism by which Microsoft could exert such an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;alleged advantage.  The fact that they own the OS does not automatically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;enable them to build superior programs, and it certainly doesn't let them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;charge more or work more efficiently.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is simply false. Control and access to a proprietary kernel ABI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and secret system interfaces confers advantage.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it doesn't. If Microsoft made all the most useful APIs in their OS
<BR>
secret it would help their applications division, but at the expense of
<BR>
crippling their OS's ability to compete. Remember, anything Microsoft can
<BR>
implement, other OS vendors can also build. If those secret features are
<BR>
actually important, a competitor can make a mint by building public
<BR>
implementations of them.
<BR>
<P>In actual fact, Microsoft has never relied on secret APIs. Sometimes they
<BR>
get lazy about documenting everything, but I have yet to see anything
<BR>
especially important in an undocumented API function (and I've done a LOT of
<BR>
Windows programming). What they have done is to write their apps to take
<BR>
every possible advantage of their OS.  Many other vendors only use OS APIs
<BR>
that are common to many different platforms, which lets them port their code
<BR>
easily but cripples their ability to exploit the unique advantages of each
<BR>
OS. But that is a necessary result of writing cross-platform code - anyone
<BR>
else who wants to write OS-specific code can get the same results as
<BR>
Microsoft.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribute software via pre-install and to control what gets shipped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a PC via exclusionary contracts with hardware vendors confers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantage.
</EM><BR>
<P>Microsoft does not own the hardware companies, and it does not have a magic
<BR>
wand that controls the industry. If hardware vendors pre-install MS
<BR>
software, they do so because they thing their customers want them to.
<BR>
<P>Besides, when has MS ever done this with a program that went on to become a
<BR>
market leader? Computers don't come pre-loaded with Office, or SQL Server,
<BR>
or anything else that MS actually makes money on. You just get free
<BR>
utilities and cheap junk that no one would actually pay retail price for.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The ability to leverage the revenue provided by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'Microsoft Tax' and dump products at below cost confers advantage.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it isn't. A large company can not gain a competitive advantage against
<BR>
smaller rivals by selling its product below cost. Why? Because the bigger it
<BR>
is, the faster it looses money by dumping.
<BR>
<P>A company with multiple product lines also can not gain competitive
<BR>
advantage by use revenue from sales of product A to subsidize below-cost
<BR>
sales of product B. If they do, they cripple the ability of product A to
<BR>
compete - their competitors can either undercut their price, or spend more
<BR>
on R&amp;D, or both.
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, neither tactic would actually do a dominant company any good in
<BR>
the long run. Dumping may drive weak competitors out of the market
<BR>
temporarily, but the instant you try to raise prices back to market levels
<BR>
they'll be back - and if you try to raise them above market levels, you are
<BR>
waving money in the face of every company that could possibly choose to
<BR>
enter your market. In the mean time, the actual dumping activity has very
<BR>
little potential to harm consumers - you might slow down innovation a
<BR>
little, but you're giving everyone your product below cost, so the net
<BR>
effect is unlikely to be negative.
<BR>
<P>All of this is standard economics today. If you don't believe me, ask any
<BR>
expert in the field.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The ability to deliberately break competing software via changes to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system confers advantage.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe a small tactical advantage, as long as you don't do it very often.
<BR>
Maybe.
<BR>
<P>The problem is that an OS that doesn't run a customer's software is
<BR>
worthless. Most customers care a lot more about their apps than they do
<BR>
about their OS. I would therefore say that the only way MS could get away
<BR>
with this without getting clobbered in the OS market is if their competitors
<BR>
their are so inept than that consumers consider them an even worse option.
<BR>
<P>Besides, once again, this can't possibly explain the actual events of the
<BR>
past 15 years. Windows isn't perfect, but it maintains at least as high a
<BR>
level of compatibility as Mac OS (or, for that matter, the few Unix vendors
<BR>
that actually bother to add features to their products). MS goes to
<BR>
considerable lengths to give everyone in the industry a chance to try out
<BR>
new OS versions long before they are released, and it is pretty unusual to
<BR>
encounter real problems with anything except antique software and obscure
<BR>
utilities (oh, and games, but that is obviously due to the game
<BR>
manufacturer's penchant for bypassing the OS to write funky,
<BR>
hardware-dependant code).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Putting aside for a moment the factual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter of whether such strategies were actually used, these are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eminently plausible mechanisms.
</EM><BR>
<P>By my count we've got two mechanisms that are considered discredited by
<BR>
mainstream economics, one artful way of cutting your own throat, and one
<BR>
strategy that might or might not give a dominant player some advantage
<BR>
*after* if becomes dominant. None of this makes a compelling case for
<BR>
massive government intervention in the market.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Microsoft dominates the i86 operating system market. Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dominates the Windows office suite market. Microsoft dominates the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Windows development tool market. I don't know the break down on web
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; browsers, last time I looked it was somewhere around 50% - though I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it's clear at this point to most observers that Netscape is on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the way out. I don't know what the situation for databases and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server products either - mail servers, etc. - but they're a significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; player in those areas too. I don't think you can seriously believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they've accomplished this success based solely on the technical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merits of their products.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I think they did it my doing a superior job of giving customers what
<BR>
they actually wanted to buy, at a price they were willing to pay. Marketing,
<BR>
strategic alliances, and backroom deals with other vendors also had a role
<BR>
to play, albeit a smaller one. But these are all legitimate business tools,
<BR>
and the overall result has been immensely beneficial to MS's customers.
<BR>
<P>The people who object to all this mostly seem to think that the public has
<BR>
somehow been flimflammed into buying an inferior product for a period of
<BR>
more than a decade now. That is self-delusion talking. If people don't buy
<BR>
the OS you consider to be superior, the rational conclusion is that most
<BR>
people aren't looking for the same thing in an OS that you want.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The Posix standard is an example here - because OS vendors had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mandate to work within a publicly available and publicly influenced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standard, today an application written for one *nix is (reasonably)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; portable to platforms offered by a variety of different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementors. I can choose AIX or Solaris or Linux or whatever because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I like it, not because it's the only place I can run Word. As a result
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there's competition in the Unix market, and I think we've all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefited.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the benefits were really all that great, you wouldn't need a government
<BR>
mandate - people would be buying it on their own.
<BR>
<P>There are good reasons why *nix OSs never caught on with consumers, and why
<BR>
their market share is so precarious now. Unix-style OSs are optimized for
<BR>
high speed, small memory footprint, low storage requirements, and maximum
<BR>
programming power. In the 60s and 70s this was a great combination, which is
<BR>
why they were so popular back then.
<BR>
<P>However, this isn't the 60s.  These days hardware capacity is dirt cheap,
<BR>
and manpower is very expensive. That means customers want an OS optimized
<BR>
for ease of use and fast coding. They want gobs and gobs of functionality in
<BR>
the OS, even if they rarely use it, because they've got disk space to burn
<BR>
and they don't want to have to code anything themselves. And most important,
<BR>
they want a vendor that will actually ask them what they want and try to
<BR>
give it to them, which is something most *nix vendors aren't particularly
<BR>
interested in doing.
<BR>
<P>Now, this is not to say that Unix is dead, or that Linux will never go
<BR>
anywhere. To the contrary, I think there will still be people using Unix
<BR>
when the singularity arrives. But complaining that customers are buying
<BR>
something else is missing the point - the purpose of an industry is to give
<BR>
customers what *they* want, not what you think they *ought* to want.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Programming languages are another example. Because C is a public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standard, I can choose compliers based on quality and appropriateness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a particular task. The same can't be said for Visual Basic, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm lucky if my code is even portable across versions.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is an inevitable trade-off between backwards compatibility and
<BR>
innovation. If you value stability, write C code on Unix. If you value rapid
<BR>
improvement, use VB or another 4GL on Windows (or wait for MS's new
<BR>
Intentional language, but that's another story).
<BR>
<P>In any case, I see absolutely no value in a government-mandated choice of
<BR>
programming languages. You get maximum benefit for everyone if vendors are
<BR>
free to offer any language they want to, and customers are free to buy
<BR>
whichever offering they prefer. If the government wants to pick a single
<BR>
standard for internal use, fine, but trying to dictate what the public has
<BR>
to use is a very bad idea.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now note that I'm talking about a governments being restricted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purchasing implementations of a public standard - not that they make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up some random junk and require that everyone observe it. I don't want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some bureaucrat throwing darts at a spec anymore than you do. Think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the mandate that DoD projects use the Ada language - this is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonable model for the sort of thing I'd like to see.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fine. What does that have to do with anti-trust law?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Personally, I'd like to see innovation stifled. I got out of Windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programming because I was sick of working in an industry where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interfaces are deprecated before they're documented, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the environment is obsolete before it ever works properly. I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want more 'technologies.' I want less code that actually works. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should take forever to add anything to the standard - I don't know if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you've done much Windows development, but it's like trying to build a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; skyscraper on quicksand. It doesn't matter how square the corners are,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's still going to sink. I have horror stories if this claim is too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abstract.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do web apps and n-tier development on Windows, so I'm right in the middle
<BR>
of the mess. And, you know, I wish they would go faster. There are several
<BR>
major revolutions in application development coming down the road, and I
<BR>
don't want to have to wait another 2-5 years for all the pieces to come
<BR>
together.
<BR>
<P>But we don't have to agree. I'm perfectly willing to let people like you go
<BR>
one using whatever OS and programming technology you prefer. I just want you
<BR>
to extend the same courtesy to people like me. Just let everyone take the
<BR>
approach they prefer, and let the market decide which one works best.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Because with 'features' you get incompatibility, and with
</EM><BR>
<P>So, let's see, you're against features, you'd like to see innovation
<BR>
stifled, and you think the government should make everyone use the same OS.
<BR>
Which agency did you say you worked for?
