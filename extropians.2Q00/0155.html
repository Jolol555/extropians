<EM>&gt;     &gt;there are a variety of external influences ranging from glucose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;availability to environmental hormones that may result in different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;brains even when you have the same genes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All true but you didn't mention the most important influence of all, memory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Although it is hardly a law of nature it is nevertheless true that up to now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different brains always have different memories regardless of genes;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which makes the claim that a twin is the same as a copy totally bogus.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good, so we don't need to belabor that point.

<EM>&gt;     &gt;Does having the same computer mean having the same software?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but by &quot;computer&quot; I don't just mean a box with electronic stuff in it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From a logical perspective if they're not running the same software then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they can't be the same computer. That's the great thing about computers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they're so easy to change, it just takes one line of code.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now lets extend the two analogies. At some point in foetal development, there is
<BR>
functionally no difference between two twin embryos. Is this within one cell
<BR>
division?
<BR>
<P>Similarly, you mirror the drive of one computer to an empty drive on another
<BR>
computer. Assume that both computers are running self aware AI applications
<BR>
while this is going on. Given quantum uncertainty, the only just moment to
<BR>
delete the original drive that the AI was mirrored from was within one processor
<BR>
cycle.
<BR>
<P>Now, since we don't have any human level AI at this point in time, we can't say
<BR>
for a certainty that turning a human level AI computer off is not tantamount to
<BR>
killing it, because you don't know how much of its awareness is due to temporary
<BR>
buffered information that isn't saved when turning it off. So the idea of
<BR>
turning the AI off, moving its hard drive over to a new machine, then turning it
<BR>
off, or of copying the drive when the original computer is off, then destroying
<BR>
the inactive hard drive, is a feasible alternative.
<BR>
<P>Now take John's favorite old story of the instant person copier machine. As soon
<BR>
as one neural processor cycle in the human mind, the human copy is its own
<BR>
person.
<BR>
<P>I don't buy the argument that you can do a destructive scan of a person's brain
<BR>
to upload to a new mind and its still the same person. We don't know enough at
<BR>
this time to make that determination, and if the only difference between the
<BR>
original and the copy is whether or not you destroy the original in the process,
<BR>
then to do so is not the ethical thing, to say the least. I know John will say
<BR>
I'm being bio-centric, or something, but nobody at this time knows enough to be
<BR>
able to tell me that all I'm doing with the destructive scan of my brain is
<BR>
giving a gift of information to someone else at the cost of my own existence.
