<P>
Hi Stan (and any observers still on board).
<BR>
<P>Thanks for your quite reasonable comment. I'm deliberately restraining 
<BR>
myself from any further replies on this issue, since I don't want to fan 
<BR>
any flames. However, since you introduce a *new* point that I want to 
<BR>
address, and since you are clearly being constructive, I am responding this 
<BR>
time. I'm also taking the opportunity to thoroughly review and address the 
<BR>
initial incident that combined with other forces to lead to the present 
<BR>
situation.
<BR>
<P>First, if Brian defended me and Extropy Institute from attacks that I never 
<BR>
knew about, I want to express my real appreciation. Although I didn't like 
<BR>
the way Brian started this discussion a few days ago, I do see how he might 
<BR>
have been upset at my not posting a clarification earlier. I've already 
<BR>
apologized for that. I've reviewed the messages and see that this is what 
<BR>
happened:
<BR>
<P>I really don't know whether I first started using &quot;ultrahuman&quot; due to 
<BR>
Brian's usage of months before. His usage in the message I found, was just 
<BR>
in passing. In fact, here is that usage:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I do see the need to mark a difference with the beliefs of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;typical humanists, but tend to think something like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;ultra-humanism&quot; (not definitionally perfect), or &quot;telo-humanism&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(definitionally more accurate, but uglier) would be better.
</EM><BR>
<P>When Brian next used the word shortly before the conference, I did not 
<BR>
remember his prior usage from months earlier. I only knew that I has been 
<BR>
using it for a while. However, last year when Brian pointed out that he had 
<BR>
used it first, I exchanged some private messages with him. He did not make 
<BR>
it out as much of an issue and we had a good-humored exchange. I did urge 
<BR>
him to post my private note the list. He didn't seem to see it as that 
<BR>
important. I think that was my misinterpretation. Now I see that it did 
<BR>
matter quite a bit to him and that he really felt that *I* should post it. 
<BR>
Here are two of my mails to Brian:
<BR>
<P>9/10/99:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Hi Brian,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sorry, but I haven't been home much at all, and have 424 messages sitting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in my in-box. I'm working at two jobs, and have the media decending on me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for much of this weekend. I'm dealing with some urgent stuff (like the IRS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and INS!), so I'm way behind on replies. Forgive me and please bear with me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I had hoped you would use my personal response to you about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;ultrahuman&quot;/&quot;ultrahumanism&quot; matter to post something to the list. Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's hard to find the time (it's now 3am and I should have been asleep long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ago...), perhaps I will simply post my private reply to the list this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;weekend, since I recall you said that was also okay with you.
</EM><BR>
<P>9/10/99 (same day reply to Brian's earlier message)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Okay, a quick direct reply to this one. I would urge you to quote whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you like from my private message to you to clarify this issue. I think,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;BTW, that you have nothing to apologize for. The foolishness that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person on the Transhuman list came up with was entirely his problem, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your doing.
</EM><BR>
<P>I *did* say that I would get around to sending the message myself if he 
<BR>
didn't. I did not do so. As I agreed readily before when I first checked 
<BR>
this, I screwed up here. It was due to an overload of work, the mails 
<BR>
getting deeply buried (my in-box these days has over 1,100 messages sitting 
<BR>
in it..), and my not realizing that it was as important to Brian as it in 
<BR>
fact was. I had left it to Brian because, unfortunately suffering from 
<BR>
perfectionism, I feel like it I'm going to say something, I have to do in 
<BR>
thoroughly, not off-handedly. As usual with perfectionism, it would have 
<BR>
better for me to fire off a couple of lines of clarification (rather than 
<BR>
the long thing that I'm now writing!).
<BR>
<P>I had no idea that my slip up led to a build-up of resentment (mostly not 
<BR>
in Brian, at least initially as far as I can tell). I didn't know that any 
<BR>
of that growing hostility was going on or else a light bulb would have gone 
<BR>
on in my head: &quot;Oh, this better go to the top of my priority list!&quot;
<BR>
<P>Stan, what's new in what you said is that Brian was concerned that my 
<BR>
comments had given the impression that *Brian* stole the idea from me 
<BR>
(&quot;from the web page&quot; is what you said). I don't remember or see any 
<BR>
evidence in those messages that I thought *this* was an impression that 
<BR>
needed correcting. I though I was supposed to correct a much less serious 
<BR>
impression--that Brian might have sounded unduly proprietary, along with 
<BR>
the impression that I had used the term first. Brian had written:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;and I realized I might have given the impression of being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;annoyingly proprietary about the term &quot;ultrahumanism,&quot; which, at some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unconscious level, perhaps was how I felt, given the timing of my email!
</EM><BR>
<P>As far as I can tell, Brian said nothing about me needing to correct an 
<BR>
impression that *he* had &quot;stolen&quot; the term from me. If I can thought that 
<BR>
was the issue, I would have been far less likely to let other matters swamp 
<BR>
it. So, Stan, please understand that my perception of what I was supposed 
<BR>
to correct was quite different from yours. (I'm not even sure if what 
<BR>
you're describing was Brian's impression at the time, or one formed later.)
<BR>
<P>Overall, I think much of the conflict resulted from differing 
<BR>
understandings and perceptions, both at that time, and more recently. I do 
<BR>
still think that Brian's initial comments about Extropians were far 
<BR>
off-base and unreasonable (not just mistaken). However, I now better 
<BR>
appreciate his frustration and see that he had allowed his thinking about 
<BR>
me and Extropians to be poisoned by some people who really have in for us.
<BR>
<P>So, I'm not apologizing for my comments on Brian's anti-Extropian messages 
<BR>
of a few days ago. I stand by those completely and by all I have written on 
<BR>
that. But I do understand, accept, and regret my own contribution to this 
<BR>
whole chain of events. If there hadn't been people with poisonous 
<BR>
intentions out there (which I do *not* think included Brian at that time), 
<BR>
this nasty episode would not have happened.
<BR>
<P>Like Stan, I am not interested in talking about the &quot;ultrahuman&quot; issue 
<BR>
further. My record as a creative thinker speaks for itself. I do not need 
<BR>
to take anyone's ideas. I don't feel any need to persuade those who are 
<BR>
determined to think ill of me. I *do* want to give the above input now that 
<BR>
I've reviewed past messages and can separate the real issues from the 
<BR>
collateral damage. I continue to have deep disagreements with Brian (many 
<BR>
probably stemming from his Platonism) and I continue to stand by my 
<BR>
responses to his recent comments about Extropians. The couple of you who 
<BR>
think I owe an apology for my recent comments will be disappointed. Those 
<BR>
of you who look for me to recognize where I originally fell short and 
<BR>
thereby contributed to the chain of events may be satisfied.
<BR>
<P>Now that I've bored everyone to tears with the length of this post I'll 
<BR>
shut up and hope not to see any need to address the issue further. 
<BR>
Obviously some people will be impossible to satisfy. Those are not the 
<BR>
people to whom this is addressed anyway.
<BR>
<P>Onward!
<BR>
