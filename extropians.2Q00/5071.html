<EM>&gt; I need to meditate more, but I can't seem to do it unless conditions are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; optimal (i.e., dark and quiet).  The only time I seem to be able find those 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; optimal conditions are after I put the kids to sleep.  By then I've already 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eaten dinner and I also find it difficult to deeply meditate on a full 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stomach.  I know this is probably more of a time management problem than a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meditation problem, but any suggestions would be appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the Zen tradition, sitting down for zazen is not meant in just the
<BR>
physical sense. By sitting down to meditate, you are choosing to put
<BR>
aside your other concerns.
<BR>
<P>Dark and quiet is not required, and you should ultimately find this to
<BR>
be so (on several occasions, I have meditated in Leicester Square). What
<BR>
is required is for you to let go of all external concerns. I can use a
<BR>
loud and crowded place, because the activity around me is of no interest
<BR>
or worry to me.
<BR>
<P>Whilst your children are awake, you will naturally wish to remain aware
<BR>
of what they are doing and attend to them if necessary. This, rather
<BR>
than the noise and light, is your key restriction.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, what method of meditation do you find most beneficial?  I find the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transcendental method easiest to do, but the Zen &quot;quiet the monkey mind&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most effective.  But it is almost impossible for me to initiate the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relaxation response using the Zen method unless it is completely quiet and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dark and I don't have a lump of food traveling through my digestive system.
</EM><BR>
<P>I should point out that initially, my meditation was based on my own
<BR>
experimentation, and it was later that I investigated established
<BR>
practices. I have learnt and practiced the Zen methods, and find them
<BR>
very effective - although after some practice, experimentation and
<BR>
advice on the traditional zazen seating position I find I am still not
<BR>
completely happy with it and I use a modified form.
<BR>
<P>In some ways, trying any new practice can be beneficial. By following
<BR>
different instructions, one finds well the common aspects of them and
<BR>
can adapt and improvise effectively.
