<P><EM>          &gt;Bell's Inequality ? I have not heard of this, brief explaination ?
</EM><BR>
<P>When a photon of undetermined polarization hits a polarizing filter there is a
<BR>
50% chance it will make it through. For many years physicists who disliked
<BR>
the idea that God played dice with the universe figured there must be a hidden
<BR>
variable inside the photon that told it what to do. By &quot;hidden variable&quot; they meant
<BR>
something different about that particular photon that we just don't know about.
<BR>
They meant something equivalent to a lookup table inside the photon that for
<BR>
one reason or another we are unable to access but the photon can when it
<BR>
wants to know if it should go through a filter or be stopped by one. We now
<BR>
understand that is impossible. In 1964 (but not published until 1967) John Bell
<BR>
showed that correlations that work by hidden variables must be less than or equal
<BR>
to a certain value, this is called Bell's inequality. In experiment it was found that
<BR>
some correlations are actually greater than that value. Quantum Mechanics can
<BR>
explain this, classical physics or even classical logic can not.
<BR>
<P>Even if Quantum Mechanics is someday proven to be untrue Bell's argument is still
<BR>
valid, in fact his original paper had no Quantum Mechanics in it; his point was that
<BR>
any successful theory about the world must explain why his inequality is violated.
<BR>
I'll try to show how to find the inequality, show why it is perfectly logical, and
<BR>
demonstrate that nature refuses to be sensible and just doesn't work the way you'd
<BR>
think it should.
<BR>
<P>I have a black box, it has a red light and a blue light on it, it also has a rotary switch
<BR>
with 6 connections at the 12,2,4,6,8 and 10 o'clock positions. The red and blue light
<BR>
blink in a manner that passes all known tests for being completely random, this is true
<BR>
regardless of what position the rotary switch is in. Such a box could be made and
<BR>
still be completely deterministic by just pre-computing 6 different random sequences
<BR>
and recording them as a lookup table in the box. Now the box would know which light to flash.
<BR>
<P>I have another black box. When both boxes have the same setting on their rotary switch
<BR>
they both produce the same random sequence of light flashes. This would also be easy
<BR>
to reproduce in a classical physics world, just record the same 6 random sequences in
<BR>
both boxes.
<BR>
<P>The set of boxes has another property, if the switches are set to opposite positions,
<BR>
12 and 6 o'clock for example, there is a total negative correlation, when one flashes red
<BR>
the other box flashes blue and when one box flashes blue the other flashes red. This just
<BR>
makes it all the easier to make the boxes because now you only need to pre-calculate
<BR>
3 random sequences, then just change every 1 to 0 and every 0 to 1 to get the other 3
<BR>
sequences and record all 6 in both boxes.
<BR>
<P>The boxes have one more feature that makes things very interesting, if the rotary switch
<BR>
on a box is one notch different from the setting on the other box then the sequence of light
<BR>
flashes will on average be different 1 time in 4. How on Earth could I make the boxes behave
<BR>
&nbsp;like that? Well, I could change on average one entry in 4 of the 12 o'clock lookup table
<BR>
(hidden variable) sequence and make that the 2 o'clock table. Then change 1 in 4 of the
<BR>
2 o'clock and make that the 4 o'clock, and change 1 in 4 of the 4 o'clock and make that the
<BR>
6 o'clock. So now the light flashes on the box set at 2 o'clock is different from the box set at
<BR>
12 o'clock on average by 1 flash in 4. The box set at 4 o'clock differs from the one set at
<BR>
12 by 2 flashes in 4, and the one set at 6 differs from the one set at 12 by 3 flashes in 4.
<BR>
<P>But I said before that the boxes at opposite settings should have a 100% anti-correlation,
<BR>
the flashes on the box set at 12 o'clock should differ from the box set 6 o'clock by 4 flashes
<BR>
in 4 NOT 3 flashes in 4. Thus if the boxes work by hidden variables then when one is set to
<BR>
12 o'clock and the other to 2 there MUST be a 2/3 correlation, at 4 a 1/3 correlation, and of
<BR>
&nbsp;course at 6 no correlation at all.
<BR>
<P>A correlation greater that 2/3, such as 3/4, for adjacent settings produces paradoxes,
<BR>
at least it would if you expected everything to work mechanistically because of some hidden
<BR>
variable involved. Does this mean it's impossible to make two boxes that have those
<BR>
specifications? Nope, but it does mean hidden variables can not be involved and that means
<BR>
something very weird is going on. Actually it would be quite easy to make a couple of boxes
<BR>
that behave like that, it's just not easy to understand how that could be.
<BR>
<P><P>Photons behave in just this spooky manner, so to make the boxes all you need it 4 things:
<BR>
<P>1) A glorified light bulb, something that will make two photons of unspecified but identical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;polarization moving in opposite directions so you can send one to each box. An excited
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calcium atom would do the trick, or you could turn a green photon into two identical lower
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;energy red photons with a crystal of potassium dihydrogen phosphate.
<BR>
<P>2) A light detector sensitive enough to observe just one photon. Incidentally the human eye
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not quite good enough to do that but frogs can, for frogs when light gets very weak it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must stop getting dimmer and appear to flash.
<BR>
<P>3) A polarizing filter, we've had these for a century or more.
<BR>
<P>4) Some gears and pulleys so that each time the rotary switch is advanced one position the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter is advanced by 30 degrees. This is because it's been known for many years that the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amount of light polarized at 0 degrees that will make it through a polarizing filter set at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X degrees is [COS (x)]^2; and if x = 30 DEGREES then the value is .75 If light is made
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;photons that translates to the probability any individual photon will make it through the filter
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is 75%.
<BR>
<P>The bottom line of all this is that there can not be something special about a specific photon,
<BR>
some internal difference, some hidden variable that determines if it makes it through a filter
<BR>
or not. Thus the universe is either non-deterministic or non-local, that is, everything influences
<BR>
everything else and does so without regard for time or space. One thing is certain,
<BR>
whatever the truth is it's weird.
<BR>
