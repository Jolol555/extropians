<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, if Roboto minds are developable in a massively, intelligent and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; super-capable sense over the eons,  does that preclude emotion?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I sure hope not.  Emotions are fun.  Even the negative ones, I wouldnt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to give up, but I dont think we would need to.  Humans have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greater intelligence than bugs, and also more emotion.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe most neuroanatomists would contend that emotions are a product
<BR>
of the &quot;reptilian&quot; brain.  They are a result of having to transfer
<BR>
hard-wired drives from hardware into software.  As situations involving
<BR>
survival, mating, collaborative behaviors, etc. become increasingly
<BR>
complex, the hardwired answers no longer work.  You have to transfer
<BR>
the motivations and behaviors into adaptations that can vary over
<BR>
a lifetime.  For example, I have heard it said that both birds
<BR>
and humans become better parents as they accumulate experience
<BR>
with emotional tradeoffs in &quot;child&quot;-rearing.  [These would range
<BR>
from such things as when to toss an offspring out of the nest to
<BR>
balancing rewards vs. punishments in humans.]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; By extrapolation, superhuman intelligence begets superhuman emotion.
</EM><BR>
<P>Spike, I have to disagree with this.  Intelligence and emotion
<BR>
are two entirely different realms.  I would say that the more
<BR>
intelligent you are, the more capable you may be of managing
<BR>
or balancing &quot;conflicting&quot; emotions.  For example, emotions may
<BR>
be very short-term reward based.  It takes intelligence to translate
<BR>
that into a long term risk-benefit tradeoff analysis.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Those of you who have been madly in love will find this easy to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand: wouldnt it be cool to take *that* emotion and pump
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it up several orders of magnitude?  {8-]  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe there was a comment in Egan's &quot;Distress&quot; (unfortunately
<BR>
my copy is in Moscow) related to this.  It had to do with an a-sex
<BR>
individual explaining to a &quot;male&quot; who was attracted to &quot;ver&quot;, how
<BR>
silly it is to be controlled by the release of a bunch of neurotransmitters
<BR>
driven by ancient reproductive needs.  Several months ago Damien
<BR>
and I had a brief crossing of swords regarding the difficulties
<BR>
we will face by individuals who can &quot;dial&quot; their emotional
<BR>
sensitivities.  It becomes far, far worse than that since
<BR>
the &quot;selecting&quot; of a &quot;sociopath&quot; emotiostate becomes &quot;easy&quot; if
<BR>
one views it to your &quot;self-interest&quot;.  The libertarian/Randian
<BR>
self-interest perspective is going to have to have to wrestle head-on
<BR>
with the Burchain supra-morality perspective if we are to have *any*
<BR>
hope of long term survival because once the historical programming
<BR>
becomes &quot;editable&quot;, all bets are off.  The Hansonian argument of
<BR>
the mostest to the firstest argues that it is going to be very messy.
<BR>
<P>Regarding being &quot;in love&quot; -- there is a fairly strong argument from
<BR>
a genetic diversity standpoint explaining why you are &quot;in love&quot; for
<BR>
a number of years (long enough to raise children to a probable survival
<BR>
maturity) followed by partner switching to increase the number of combinations
<BR>
of &quot;selfish genes&quot;.  So by &quot;pumping up&quot; the emotion, do you want to
<BR>
increase the rate of partner switching?  Or do you want to simply
<BR>
increase the &quot;self-delusion&quot; that you have never before been &quot;happier&quot;
<BR>
realizing that with the increased intelligence goes the increased
<BR>
awareness that &quot;happiness&quot; is an entirely biochemical state?
<BR>
<P>&quot;Get ready for me love coz I'm a comin'
<BR>
&nbsp;I'm simply gotta march, my heart's a drummin'
<BR>
&nbsp;Don't bring around the cloud 
<BR>
&nbsp;To rain on my parade&quot;....

<BR>
<P>I think that some of Eliezer's work on how to define motivational
<BR>
agendas and goal oriented selection vs. simple &quot;emotions&quot; may provide
<BR>
a path out of this pit.  But Spike's comments (no offense Spike!)
<BR>
provide an example of exactly how difficult it will be for people
<BR>
to consider how to self-evolve themselves to a level undictated
<BR>
by millions of years of evolution of selfish genes.
<BR>
<P>We will face a question in the future if the &quot;survival instincts&quot;
<BR>
of the cur-humans bear consideration or preservation in the light
<BR>
of the consiously constructed and directed instincts of the neo-humans,
<BR>
particularly in view of the probability that the archeo-instincts could
<BR>
motivate or drive one to destructive (i.e. un-extropic) behaviors.
