Funny how things stick in your mind.....I guess it's a meme-thing.
<BR>
<P>What I've been thinking about lately have been anti &quot;projecticle' systems
<BR>
for armored tanks.
<BR>
<P>I recall reading about an Isreali tank casualty in one of the Arab-Isreal
<BR>
wars......it was drapped with the wires from wire guided missles.  It seems
<BR>
that one of the crew members was very observant.....he would spot  the
<BR>
engine flare from a shoulder launched  wire-guided anti-tank missle and
<BR>
direct the tank's gun to it....the gun had a MUCH greater velocity than the
<BR>
missle...so shortly thereafter the missle became UN guided.....
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately they eventually got him.....overwhelmed by numbers I suppose.
<BR>
<P>That was years ago.....what might be possible now with the (cheap) advent of
<BR>
Laser Radar (Lidar?) Psuedo AI threat analysis and  targeting systems, Smart
<BR>
Darts (guided bullets) and Hi Energy Laser Pulses?
<BR>
<P>I've heard that the age of armor (tanks) is over with the invention of
<BR>
shoulder launched anti tank rockets....but is that true?
