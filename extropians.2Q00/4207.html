<P><P>| I think you would have to implement some kind of collision protocol such
<BR>
| as in ethernet to prevent that :-)
<BR>
<P>:')  Who knows, quantum computers cometh.
<BR>
<P>| Anyway, what you are describing is not the kind of paradox people keep
<BR>
| going on about. It seems like whenever talk of FTL communications comes
<BR>
| up, people start spouting off about the future, the past, paradoxes, etc.
<BR>
| Just seems silly to me.
<BR>
<P>I agree.  I don't see any practical application (like warning Nixon to
<BR>
cancel the Watergate break in).  In fact, the more I think about it, the
<BR>
less likely the entire experiment (nyt) seems.  What's really happening, I
<BR>
think, is that the pulse is recieved visually before it *normally* would
<BR>
be - not before it *happened*.
<BR>
<P>Anybody, correct me if I'm wrong.
<BR>
<P>In an extreme case, I might *percieve* FTL emissions from an event that
<BR>
occured at a distance of 60 feet before you (at 6 inches) *percieve*
<BR>
subluminal emissions from the same event.  I don't, however, percieve the
<BR>
event before it happens.  It's all perception is my point - I think.
<BR>
<P>However, in the off chance that I am wrong on this, consider the following
<BR>
&quot;paradoxical&quot; scenario:
<BR>
<P>In the hypothetical experiment below, the energy (electrons) exerted to
<BR>
produce our initial lightwave (B--&gt;F) (photons) was restored/never-exerted
<BR>
once the transmission was aborted.  At the same time, the transmission
<BR>
(E--&gt;C) would never have taken place if that energy was NOT exerted, so the
<BR>
B--&gt;F would have to be un-canceled.... so on and so forth...  Beyond the
<BR>
obvious &quot;hey, that's impossible&quot; response, consider the theory of
<BR>
conservation of energy.  Those photons were created by an exertion of
<BR>
electrons which didn't actually happen - new energy was created without an
<BR>
expenditure of old...  Beam me up Scotty.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, paradoxes come up because the concept is intriguing and very
<BR>
difficult (or impossible) to fully understand within the constraints of our
<BR>
system of logic.  In other words, paradoxes are cool.
<BR>
<P>Random thought:  replace the experiment's second device (DEF) with a mirror
<BR>
inside the cesium chamber.

<BR>
| &gt; &gt; And I still don't see (assume for a moment they really can transmit
<BR>
| &gt; &gt; light, and therefore information, faster than normal lightspeed) how
<BR>
| &gt; &gt; sending light faster than normal would lead to any kind of paradox.
<BR>
| &gt;
<BR>
| &gt; Imagine the following:
<BR>
| &gt;
<BR>
| &gt; You have a lightwave controller (A), which controls a light transmitter
<BR>
(B),
<BR>
| &gt; and which is connected to a light receiver (C).  You have a similiar
<BR>
| &gt; configuration on the far end of the &quot;tunnel&quot; - let's say controller (D),
<BR>
| &gt; transmitter (E), and receiver (F).
<BR>
| &gt;
<BR>
| &gt; See diagram at <A HREF="http://enablia.dynip.com/public/unreal.gif">http://enablia.dynip.com/public/unreal.gif</A>
<BR>
| &gt;
<BR>
| &gt; In a particular experiment, I program A to send a signal through B which
<BR>
is
<BR>
| &gt; recieved by F.  I also program D to, at the moment it recieves a signal
<BR>
| &gt; through F, send a signal to C (via E).  I then program A to abort the
<BR>
| &gt; transmission through B if it recieves a signal through C.  Assume that
<BR>
| &gt; controller to peripheral communication costs 0 time.  Let's also assume
<BR>
that
<BR>
| &gt; data processing and code execution costs 0 time.  (I'm asking for some
<BR>
| &gt; imagination here!).
<BR>
| &gt;
<BR>
| &gt; So, A tells B to send a FTL signal to F.  D, upon recieving this signal,
<BR>
| &gt; tells E  to send a FTL signal to C.  A, upon receiving this signal (via
<BR>
C),
<BR>
| &gt; aborts the original transmission WHICH HAS ALREADY TAKEN PLACE.  Paradox
<BR>
| &gt; anyone?
