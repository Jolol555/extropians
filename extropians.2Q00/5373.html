<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  This has ended up saving us tons of money.  First the cable bill 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(~$40/mo.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  for programming that I hardly enjoyed anyway).  I have also found that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  out of the loop in terms of current cultural trends has saved me bucks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  [snip]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Suffice it to say that, even if they gave it away for free, I'd never 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  cable TV hooked back up.  Plus, I spent the money I'd otherwise be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spending
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  on TV on a high-bandwidth net connection, which I also find more useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  enjoyable than I ever found TV to be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There is some price you pay for this choice.  I don't think I lose much by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not watching network TV, but we watch a LOT of movies on cable.  Although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there are a lot of truly terrible films made, there are also many, many 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worthwhile ones.  Film has been the hallmark art form of our age to date.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;acts as a powerful lens through which some of the brightest minds of our 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have expressed themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>What I forgot to mention is that we still have and use our VCR and DVD 
<BR>
players and a very well used Blockbuster Video account.  You don't need 
<BR>
cable to watch movies at home.  And, as I remember, the cable channels 
<BR>
rarely showed the movies I wanted to see; and when they did the would replay 
<BR>
it over and over as if I really wanted to watch the same movie 5 times 
<BR>
within the same week.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Oh - and fashion can be fun, too, you know.  It's nice to get dressed up 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;put on a show every once in a while.  We are monkey-men, after all, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;display and pageantry are also important means of expression.  Those great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Texas philosophers, ZZ Top, were on to something, I think.
</EM><BR>
<P>To each his own.  I was thrilled the day I walked out of my office job, 
<BR>
leaving my suits hanging in the closet at home.  They rarely get use 
<BR>
anymore, and that &quot;suits&quot; me just fine.  My idea of fashion is comfort, 
<BR>
read: jeans, T-shirts and running shoes.
