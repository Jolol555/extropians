<P><EM>&gt;you need to start with an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enormous positive cash balance to make the system economically viable; a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ponzi scheme would quickly collapse and the taxation required would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;destroy the economy.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I find this hard to belive. After all, you already pointed out that
<BR>
providing the net direct to the poor would halve the current costs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;how would differences in cost of living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be accounted for?  The poverty line in the greater Silicon Valley area
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would put one in the upper middle class in North Dakota. 
</EM><BR>
<P>How does it work with aged pensions now? Everyone gets the same, no? With
<BR>
this minimal security, people might well up-sticks and move somewhere
<BR>
cheaper. The hope is that sufficient of them will use this stake/security
<BR>
to start some productive enterprise or fund their education, not just kick
<BR>
back. And then this added wealth will be cropped to help support the
<BR>
process. Or so thought Milton Friedman, that notorious Red, back in the
<BR>
sixties.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;there is something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very bad economically about &quot;taxation-for-welfare&quot; systems.  The government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has not figured out a way to support the non-productive without causing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;adverse economic impacts on the individuals they are taxing. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed this is a `social engineering' problem (in Popper's sense).
<BR>
Construing the payment as `stakeholder' dividends might be one way to shift
<BR>
the mental patterns involved.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Most people will work if there is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opportunity and very few blatantly abuse the system.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed. The key psychological point, I believe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;However, supporting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the &quot;leeches&quot; puts a strain on the economy and on the productive class
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that is disproportionate to their numbers.  In fact, from the best I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tell, the leeches take more from the economy when they are not working,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than they are likely to add when they are.  Quite frankly, these people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are a social evil and should be tossed to the curb
</EM><BR>
<P>Aargh. No, I'm not going to get all bleeding-heart here. Haven't you
<BR>
noticed what happens when people get tossed to the curb? They turn and
<BR>
snarl and bite. Eventually they come into your neighborhood and do painful
<BR>
things. You might recommend killing them if they have the gall to do so.
<BR>
This strikes me as a social corrosive even more appalling that the rot you
<BR>
discern in their state-subsidised moral fibre.
<BR>
<P>But you might be right. And so might I. More probably there's a better way
<BR>
neither of us have thought of. And the Spike will make it all redundant in
<BR>
50 years or so anyway. But meanwhile, I'm happy to `buy the bastards off',
<BR>
if one insists on seeing it that way -- while keeping the ill effects
<BR>
contained by suitable security measures as are required, and by social
<BR>
engineering if that's possible.
