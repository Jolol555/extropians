</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm a little behind watching the Charlie Rose series on PBS this past
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; week which dealt with genomics.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It would be nice to have someone on this series who makes the case for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-improvement, and Watson looks like the best chance so far.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have not had a chance to see any interviews in the series this week.  (I
<BR>
will put up with Rose if someone interesting is on the show.)  I noticed
<BR>
that William Haseltine (Chairman and CEO of Human Genome Sciences) was
<BR>
supposed to appear in one of the episodes.  He was interviewed on a PBS
<BR>
show called [CEO Exchange] which was broadcast in May---I actually
<BR>
attended the taping of that episode on Cornell University's campus (any 
<BR>
transhumanists in Ithaca, by the way?)---in which he made several somewhat 
<BR>
encouragaing statements.
<BR>
<P>He was quite well-prepared and comfortable in the interview, if maybe a
<BR>
little too good at smooth-talking.
<BR>
<P>He claims that he's not interested in making money and explains his
<BR>
creation and sale of a dozen companies and the relentless exploitation of
<BR>
patents as the discerning use of particular tools for the higher purpose of
<BR>
effective research and development.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the show:
</EM><BR>
<P>INTERVIEWER: We've already seen efforts to stop bioengineering in some
<BR>
countries {. . .}.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've identified the area of concern. {. . .} I'm afraid it will be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the political process reflecting a public debate which is not an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;informed debate which will lead to poor decisions which will adversely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affect human health and our business.  That's what I worry about.
<BR>
<P>INTERVIEWER: {Haseltine speculated that} we're actually going to change the
<BR>
notion of what we mean by [living things].  Is that a couple of centuries
<BR>
away in your view or a lot closer than that?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a lot closer than that.  I think that the future I see is a fusion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between material science and biology.  I've even given it a name; I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call it [atomic-scale engineering].  We're going to take all the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruments---communication instruments, computers . . . and reduce
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them in size to the size of the architectural element of an atom. {. . .} 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's beginning to happen.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{T}en years from now {. . .} I might want to be making surgical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruments that go inside our brain for medical purposes.
<BR>
<P>Strange, though: another prominent person sounding like they invented a
<BR>
field or idea that has been around for decades.  He spoke a bit more about
<BR>
nanomedicine-style technology in a section which was not broadcast.
<BR>
<P>I spoke to Haseltine at the reception following the taping (the roast beef
<BR>
was great).  The interviewer had actually asked him what he thought about
<BR>
Joy's essay, which part did not make it into the final broadcast.
<BR>
Haseltine was politely dismissive but not terribly explicit.  I mentioned
<BR>
Joy again to him, expressing a reluctance to give him more attention than
<BR>
he's already gotten (yeah, I know---why bring him up, then?)---Haseltine
<BR>
expressed serious doubts that Joy is really in touch with the technology
<BR>
and its actual development.  He clearly does not take any of Joy's
<BR>
criticism seriously.  I didn't get to say or hear much else because he,
<BR>
mid-sentence, literally, flew off to see some elderly professor or someone
<BR>
whom he obviously knew.
<BR>
<P>He took quite an interest in two students in the nanobiotechnology
<BR>
department who attended the taping (and who later received a strong
<BR>
reaction from me when they said that they assumed that Drexler [isn't a 
<BR>
scientist] and when they partly blamed him for their observation that
<BR>
the public has a profound misunderstanding about the maturity of their
<BR>
work---they're not anywhere near assemblers).
