<P><EM>&gt;True. Social services fill a need and are provided because most people can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see the cause and effect of the spending vs. the state of affairs. This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the big dumb-dumb factor of Libertarian politics. It ignores causation. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;asserts that &quot;things will work themselves out&quot; as soon as we stop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interfering.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Pound foolish, penny wise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Fact:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A full-blown Harvard Education costs a fraction of what it costs to house a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;criminal from age fifteen for life. But some people don't want to pay a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;school tax to pay for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;K-12 education and God forbid one should provide childcare for a poor kid,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they'd much rather wait and pay their tax bucks to punish him after he's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;killed a cop or a store clerk -- or perhaps their mom.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Here's another political incongruity:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Most people who are pro-life (antiabortion) are FOR the death penalty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;; - )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I guess it's OK to kill children, as long as you wait until they grow up --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unwanted and in poverty -- so they can kill someone else first!
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm pro-choice and pro-death penalty.  At least I'm consistent, but I am 
<BR>
kind of troubled about what that says about the value I place on human life. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm....
