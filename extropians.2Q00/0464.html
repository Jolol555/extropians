<EM>&gt; I think monopolization is a problem and that intervention is in some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instances beneficial. I'd be interested in discussing arguments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that this is not the case, but simply asserting there exist unnamed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experts who disagree with me isn't useful. I'm not going to do your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research for you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Like I said before, this is the standard position of modern economic theory.
<BR>
Look in any economics textbook if you don't believe me.
<BR>
<P>Now, I don't see much point in trotting out a dozen old chestnuts and
<BR>
dismembering them without even knowing which ones you think are valid. So,
<BR>
what actual historical event do you think lend support to concerns about
<BR>
monopolies? Standard Oil? The 19th century railroads? Modern-day phone and
<BR>
electricity utilities? Pick an example you think is valid, and I'll address
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This would be true if there were competition. There isn't.
</EM><BR>
<P>And why not? Did MS wave a magic wand that caused all other OS vendors to
<BR>
vanish in a puff of smoke? did they get the government to forbid OS
<BR>
competition? Did they send thugs with guns to blow up competitor's
<BR>
facilities?
<BR>
<P>No. They simply did such a good job of convincing people to buy their
<BR>
software that all of their competitors were reduced to bit-player status.
<BR>
That, of course, is only possible if you are actually giving your customers
<BR>
what they want, which means you are doing exactly what businesses are
<BR>
supposed to do.
<BR>
<P>But that doesn't mean MS can now jack up OS prices, stop improving their OS,
<BR>
and divert all the proceeds from OS sales into convincing people to use
<BR>
their other products. If they do, that makes them a sitting duck for anyone
<BR>
who wants to compete with Windows.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This would be true if vendors had some credible alternative to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shipping Windows. They don't.
</EM><BR>
<P>And nothing the government has proposed would create one, either. Anti-trust
<BR>
action cannot create new products, it can only destroy existing ones.
<BR>
<P>I'm not happy about the supine posture of the OS vendors either. I'd
<BR>
certainly prefer to have someone out there mounting a vigorous effort to
<BR>
compete with Windows in the same market. But MS is holding off competition
<BR>
purely by means of legitimate competitive tactics, and there is nothing the
<BR>
government can do to rectify the situation short of disbanding MS and
<BR>
confiscating Windows - and doing that would ensure that no one else will
<BR>
dare invest any real effort in their OS, for fear of the same punishment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;No, it isn't. A large company can not gain a competitive advantage
</EM><BR>
against
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;smaller rivals by selling its product below cost. Why? Because the bigger
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is, the faster it looses money by dumping.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not true. The incremental cost of software is zero.
</EM><BR>
<P>But the development cost is huge, and you have to recoup it somewhere. Every
<BR>
copy of Word that MS gives away is a copy they don't make any money on. In
<BR>
the end they have to actually charge you for the product, or they go under.
<BR>
The bigger you are, the more revenue you give up by dumping. The fact that
<BR>
big companies tend to have more overhead than small one's doesn't help them
<BR>
in this equation either.
<BR>
<P>In general, a small competitor can usually fight a dumping war on pretty
<BR>
even terms with a big one, as long as it is past the &quot;tiny shoestring-budget
<BR>
startup&quot; phase.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;The problem is that an OS that doesn't run a customer's software is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;worthless. Most customers care a lot more about their apps than they do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about their OS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly. Since the software most people want to run is only available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on Windows any other OS is worthless - regardless of it's other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merits or technical superiority to Windows.
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be perfectly legal for another company to build an OS capable of
<BR>
running Windows programs. If it were also superior to Windows in some other
<BR>
respect, it should be a very lucrative investment for a company like HP or
<BR>
IBM. So, why hasn't it been done?
<BR>
<P>IMO, there are two related factors. One is the fact that OS vendors are
<BR>
generally either big, established companies that aren't willing to abandon
<BR>
their investment in existing OSs, or tiny visionary efforts that don't have
<BR>
the resources to write that much code. The other is that Windows is not
<BR>
nearly as bad as its detractors claim, and its rate of improvement is fast
<BR>
enough that it is difficult for a reverse-engineering effort to keep up.
<BR>
<P>But none of this amounts to an argument for anti-trust action against MS.  I
<BR>
mean, what exactly is the government going to do that would improve the
<BR>
situation? Force everyone to use Linux instead?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If the benefits [of the Posix standard] were really all that great,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you wouldn't need a government mandate - people would be buying it on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This gets into deeper game-theory questions. The consequence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individuals doing what is locally optimal isn't necessary the global
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; optimum. (Nine out of ten dentists agree with me on this one.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Nothing can ever give you an 'optimal' use of economic resources - that's
<BR>
like trying to establish a utopian society or an incorruptible government.
<BR>
What a free market does do is give you a very reliable way of ensuring that
<BR>
you are always moving in the direction of whatever would currently be
<BR>
optimal. You'll never get there, because by the time you do something better
<BR>
will be possible, but you can count on steady long-term improvement.
<BR>
<P>Government intervention, OTOH, replaces this economic process with a
<BR>
political contest that has no incentive to even try to find a global
<BR>
optimum. That's why government intervention is so uniformly detrimental. No
<BR>
matter what the motives for the intervention may start out being, the
<BR>
process will simply end up serving the interests of those with the most
<BR>
political clout.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This reminds me. I forgot to mention vaporware as another monopolist's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tool. But I'm not talking about backward compatibility - I'm talking about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public standards. These are distinct.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, please. I don't know about Unixland, but in the PC market everyone uses
<BR>
vaporware as a marketing tool, and they've been doing it since MS was a
<BR>
couple of guys in a garage. That isn't monopolism.
<BR>
<P>And there is nothing inherently good or bad about public standards. What is
<BR>
good is giving customers what they want. Sometimes public standards help
<BR>
with that, but very often they are simply obstacles to anyone who thinks of
<BR>
a better way of doing things.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sure. Do what you want. I don't want to restrict your choice, I want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to give you more options. Wouldn't you like to choose between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different Windows or VB implementations?
</EM><BR>
<P>I want you to leave the market alone. MS already gives me all of the choices
<BR>
I actually want, and they work very hard to make sure that that remains the
<BR>
case. The things you agonize over are completely unimportant to me, and the
<BR>
things I care about seem to be incomprehensible or 'evil' to you. So, stop
<BR>
thinking you can make my choices for me.
<BR>
<P>The government can't create new versions of Windows, or an improved
<BR>
programming language, or anything else that I might want. All it can do is
<BR>
ban products, retard development, punish success, and create
<BR>
politically-motivated regulations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyway - I apologize if the above is a bit glib. I find this all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhat tiresome. Doing a search on DejaNews will turn up gigabytes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of variation on the arguments we've both advanced going back 10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years. I think both our positions are clear, and I'm sure you find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mine as ludicrous as I find yours. Do you see a middle ground we'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both be happy with - any room for constructive discussion?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure. How about we refrain from arguing about whether Windows is good or
<BR>
bad, or even whether MS is nice or not, and stick with the question of
<BR>
whether the government can do something to make things better by intervening
<BR>
in the market?
