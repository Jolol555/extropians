</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(was: RE: Transparency Debate)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Date: Sat, 08 Apr 2000 12:38:33 -0700
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I am working on systems to bring such a society about, i.e., social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; infrastructure, such as an explicit universal social contract.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've been working on a system that seems similar - perhaps you could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tell me if it is?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I call it &quot;enlightened greed&quot;, and it is driven by the principle that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the correct action is that which will benefit me most in the long term.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For example, longevity research is a good thing in part because it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;result in practices and objects that will allow me to live longer, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the easiest way to get it is by enouraging this research for application
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the general public: when the benefits are so applied, then I, as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;member of the public, can take advantage of it.  Therefore encouraging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;longevity research so that anyone who wants to can live longer is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;correct approach for me to take.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The important thing is that nowhere in the decision is there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consideration of what would be good or bad for anybody else, save how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that may eventually affect myself.  And yet the more I tinker with it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the more it seems to come up with ends that, under more common ethical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;measures, are labeled &quot;noble&quot; or &quot;altruistic&quot; - which are qualities not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;usually associated with greed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In a contractual society, in which - given my other assumptions -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; presumeably all rational people could be convinced of the advantage of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ethical, a lot of the really bad scenarios that would otherwise require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; draconian measures, such as a police state to stop nanoterrorists, would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; limited to a probably small minority of very irrational people, who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; likely be identified fairly early as creating high risks for anyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dealt with them long term.  Thus, those people would be watched and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; probably pay high insurance premiums and find themselves unwelcome in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; social settings.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But, how do you make sure that the criteria for &quot;watch&quot; and &quot;pay high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;insurance premiums&quot; only targets those who would have a negative effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on society?  Nanoterrorists are a subset of people who know how to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nanotech, but if it is far easier/cheaper to identify nanotech users
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than just malicious nanotech users, how do you avoid alienating those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who would use nanotech to benefit society?  (Note that this alienation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;may, in some cases, turn those who would otherwise work for everyone's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefit into revenge-driven terrorists.)  This might work if you could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get around that problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>The primary incentives to engage in surveillance would be for those who 
<BR>
would benefit from doing the surveillance.  This would include, among 
<BR>
others, your local neighborhood watch group equivalent, the insurance 
<BR>
companies for certain, freelancers going for rewards posted by insurance 
<BR>
companies, and, of course, nosy people and people who are out to get you 
<BR>
personally.
<BR>
<P>If you are not doing anything that generates uncovered - by bond, insurance 
<BR>
or prior contract - risk, then you have nothing to fear.  I suspect that the 
<BR>
general social contract would evolve much like the common law in that 
<BR>
restrictions on the use of information gained via spying might arise through 
<BR>
case law, if nothing else.
<BR>
<P>Also, the combined community of intellectual property producers might write 
<BR>
an addendum to the social contract that specified rules and penalties for 
<BR>
inappropriate release of confidential information.  No one could be forced 
<BR>
in general to sign, but they might not find many welcome mats if they 
<BR>
didn't.  There are many possible routes and many variations that could arise 
<BR>
via private or public negotiations among the parties.  Religious groups, for 
<BR>
example, might include special clauses in a sub-contract that bound only 
<BR>
their self-chosen membership to those rules of diet or sexual relations, 
<BR>
etc.
<BR>
<P>If you are actively engaged in nanotech, then you probably can assume that 
<BR>
you will be watched from several quarters.  The level of surveillance would 
<BR>
be determined in general by the market response.  Insurance companies 
<BR>
specialize in making these kind of calculations, so I would imagine that the 
<BR>
risk - of nanoterrorism, etc. -  would never be zero, just calculated to 
<BR>
maximize their profits long term.  This might not be sufficient, if their 
<BR>
judgement was faulty, but then survival is never absolutely guaranteed.  A 
<BR>
micro black hole could come flying thru right now and punch a hole through 
<BR>
your brain, but it's probably not worth taking special countermeasures at 
<BR>
this point - whatever they might be(???).
<BR>
<P>Re ethics.  The pure benefit analysis just doesn't quite do the trick, I'm 
<BR>
really sorry to say (as explicated really nicely by Xerene and Strackon in a 
<BR>
late '60's Invictus article).  It provides plenty of reasons to look like 
<BR>
you're moral and to encourage other people to be moral, and it even rules 
<BR>
out casual dishonestly on the grounds of the additional mental processing 
<BR>
involved in lieing, as David Friedman discussed in an article in &quot;Liberty,&quot; 
<BR>
but it doesn't address the professional criminal at all.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, the real reason most people are moral is that they value 
<BR>
visibility and emotional openness - something like the old, rarely-heard 
<BR>
concept of honor.  They despise having to live a lie, hide psychologically 
<BR>
like a rat, etc.  These costs - of living a criminal life - can be quite 
<BR>
devastating.  Check out &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley,&quot; if you haven't already.
