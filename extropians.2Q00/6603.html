<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Luckily, I'm in a country with a solid welfare system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Much as I'd loathe doing it, I have this to fall back on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If there was no welfare system, I would be back in the public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; service like a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shot.... The system I'm building would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; likely not exist, and have no hope of existing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Remember the basic principles of the welfare state: people are too stupid, 
<BR>
weak and evil to decide for themselves. It is better if a technocratic elite 
<BR>
does it in their place. Really, if something is an opposition to 
<BR>
transhumanism it is the welfare and the attitudes it spread in the 
<BR>
population. I just have to look at my own country, Sweden (the most 
<BR>
extensive welfare state in the world), to see its ill effects. People loose 
<BR>
their creativity, work doesn't pay off (have to pay all those taxes to 
<BR>
empower the politicians and the bureaucrats, in Sweden a 50% tax on income 
<BR>
is standard), and a sizable part of the population is dependant on the 
<BR>
goodwill of bureaucrats for every instance of their lives (2/3 of the 
<BR>
population). I survive as a businessman here in Sweden JUST by constantly 
<BR>
beating the system. If I was following the rules I would go chapter 11, 
<BR>
immediately.
<BR>
<P>I' m often appaled by the lack of ideological consciousness among 
<BR>
transhumanists, the welfare state doesn't produce self- asserted 
<BR>
individuals. It produces sycophants, that are horribly afraid of what other 
<BR>
people might think (after all that's the normal situation in a welfare 
<BR>
state, the bureaucrats' opinion matter for all decisions in life. Forget 
<BR>
about expanding your lifespan, forget about cryonics! In the welfare state 
<BR>
you don't have the economic resources to be innovative, people in the 
<BR>
welfare states are poor- the government is rich.
<BR>
<P>And if you fall through the system, there is nothing else to rely on. And if 
<BR>
the system collapses the country goes down the drain. Uruguay was  one of 
<BR>
the richest countries once, by adopting a very big welfare state they lost 
<BR>
that position. So has Sweden.
<BR>
<P>One might wonder why this way of thinking is so wide spread among 
<BR>
transhumanists. Well, most don't understand the connections between 
<BR>
technology and society, and how they interrelate. As the vice chairman of 
<BR>
Aleph I once talked to one of our members. I asked him: &quot;why are you a 
<BR>
transhumanist?&quot;. He replied: &quot;I just want to play a bit with computers&quot;. I 
<BR>
predicted then that I would never see him again. Call me psychic, I was 
<BR>
right. Because in the mass society (as German economist Wilhelm Röpke called 
<BR>
it), you are not able to cultivate your own interests, the priorities made 
<BR>
by others take precedence. And if you don't understand what transhumanism 
<BR>
really is about you soon wont see why it is practical, or moral.
<BR>
<P>I have come to the conclusion that transhumanism in many ways have made 
<BR>
grave mistakes in its strategy. Perhaps it has lacked the important 
<BR>
ideological education.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I'd be paying less tax. But I'd be far less innovative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Emlyn
</EM><BR>
<P>You'll be just as innovative as other people tell you to be (its not for you 
<BR>
to decide, you don't have the means). But being innovative isn't really all 
<BR>
transhumanism is about. A nazi can &quot;play a bit with computers&quot;. 
<BR>
Transhumanism is a much greater stream of ideas that touch all aspects of 
<BR>
life. Transhumanism has to interest itself in politics.
<BR>
