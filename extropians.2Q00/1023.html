<EM>&gt; &gt;Oh really? Then would you care to explain how Microsoft managed to achieve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;an even larger share of the office suite market on the MacOS than on its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;own OS?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  There are more plausible hypotheses than I would care to list. Your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;observation only rules out a small portion of the ones that have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;proposed.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's probably pointless to go into this further, unless there is some way 
<BR>
of testing the alternative hypotheses. The relative success of the Office 
<BR>
programs on the Mac seems to me to be prima facie counter-evidence to the 
<BR>
anti-MS brigade. I didn't mention other evidence the presenters gave, such 
<BR>
as the clear correlation between Microsoft's entry into a certain market 
<BR>
and a fall in software prices in that market. (I experienced this with ExI, 
<BR>
in buying database software. MS Access was a bargain, the best DB 
<BR>
program--for ExI's purposes--out of the several that I had used, and it 
<BR>
pushed other DB makers to reduce prices.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I'd have to dig out the authors and their book, but at a Cato/Forbes ASAP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;conference, I saw it convincingly demonstrated that Microsoft's success in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;each area of software directly correlated with the comparative quality of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;their products according to computer magazine reviews. (For instance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Each area that they chose to study. As far as I recall, they didn't study
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some important areas such as operating systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know about that without getting the book. However, my point was 
<BR>
that they showed compelling evidence against the idea that Microsoft got 
<BR>
significant leverage in application software from controlling the OS. I 
<BR>
wouldn't want to say they extracted *no* advantage, just that it's less 
<BR>
that envious competitors want to admit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Showing that such a correlation exists only shows that technical competence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was one of the strategies they used, not that it was their sole strategy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course. I was puzzled why you thought that I believed otherwise until I 
<BR>
re-read the passage to which I was responding:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;player in those areas too. I don't think you can seriously believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;that they've accomplished this success based solely on the technical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;merits of their products.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just to clarify: Certainly I do *not* believe that technical competence was 
<BR>
the only factor. Some other factors include superb management, superior 
<BR>
business strategy, a policy of hiring the best programmers, effective 
<BR>
marketing, a strong focus on developer relationships, and a relentless 
<BR>
drive to improve on imperfect products.
<BR>
<P>Look, *someone* has to defend Microsoft these days!

stock...I also own stock in people who hate Microsoft, particularly Oracle.]
