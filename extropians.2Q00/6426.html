Hi!

<EM>&gt;As I've stated for may years (since my comments in the early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'90's on sci.life-extension and bionet.molbio.ageing),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;DNA damage accumulation *should* be part of aging.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I base this entirely on the observation that mutations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are known to accumulate and in single cells that get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;amplified lead to cancer.  We have little idea what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mutations may be in non oncogene/tumor-suppressor genes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the exception of some work done in the HPRT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gene (R. Albertini comes to mind) and some work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that I believe has been done in blood group genes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;though the details slip my mind at the moment.
</EM><BR>
<P>That DNA mutations accumulate with age has long been known (I can give you
<BR>
several refs on that). The question is whether this affects or not the
<BR>
aging process (upstream or downstream?). Studies done in the 60's and 70's
<BR>
using ionizing radiation, UV, chemical mutagens, etc. in mice and flies
<BR>
showed that the mutations caused by these agents are not a part of the
<BR>
aging process. Perhaps other forms of DNA damage are involved (the
<BR>
telomeres?) but there is no conclusive evidence on that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It does however in my mind provide a significant amount of gravity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for the DNA Damage theory as being a factor in the aging process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The developmental genes in an adult can accumulate mutations and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you will never know it.  But if you try to grow a new adult using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those genes with accumulated mutations, then the results detailed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;above are a likely result.
</EM><BR>
<P>I asked this in a previous post, I ask it again, why then do clones made
<BR>
from young cells (taken from foetus, not young adults) show the exact same
<BR>
problems? Until you can answer me this I will not be convinced.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This makes sense -- why would you want to expend resources repairing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;genes that the average cell will never use again?
</EM><BR>
<P>I never liked Kirkwood's disposable soma theory and this reminds me of it.
<BR>
Here's my problem: if you overexpress telomerase in mitotic cells they will
<BR>
overcome aging without any noticeable loss of resources. So, even assuming
<BR>
the telomeres as an anti-cancer mechanisms, cells can very cheaply overcome
<BR>
senescence, contradicting Kirkwood's theory. Many species showing
<BR>
vegetative reproduction are other examples refuting these theories. In
<BR>
addition, studies done in biotechnology show that cells can overexpress
<BR>
large amounts of trangenic genes without any noticeable deleterious effect
<BR>
(unless a toxic product is involved, of course).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In looking at this it seems to me that nature will have tuned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;repair mechanisms (you don't think running ECC checks on 3x10^9 BP/cell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that are receiving thousands+ mutations/day is cheap do you???)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to match the requirements -- &quot;frequently used programs&quot; ==
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;highly active repair&quot;, &quot;less used programs&quot; == &quot;less active repair&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;never used programs&quot; == &quot;very rare repair&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I must say that although your ideas are logical I'm not convinced. For
<BR>
instance, wouldn't it be cheaper to just repair everything instead of
<BR>
creating and powering a whole mechanism just to determine what is useful
<BR>
and what isn't. Besides, I am not aware of any experimental evidence
<BR>
supporting these ideas (unless you know something I don't; for example, has
<BR>
DNA repair the same efficiency in introns and exons?). And let's face it,
<BR>
there are already dozens of logical theoretical framworks to explain aging.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes.
