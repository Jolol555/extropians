<EM>&gt;Robert, you're applying a level of rationality to the mentality behind this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kind of action that just doesn't work.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with your view in general attitude.  However, I would caution 
<BR>
against a common tendency to label opponents' views as &quot;irrational.&quot; 
<BR>
When we do this, it greatly reduces our ability to engage in a 
<BR>
meme-war or PR-battle.
<BR>
<P>If we view opposing views as irrational, then we do not try to 
<BR>
respond to those views or even refute them directly.  In the 
<BR>
meme-battle-space or PR-arena, this makes us appear to be the 
<BR>
irrational or nonresponsive party.
<BR>
<P>If we view opposing views as irrational, then we do no try to make 
<BR>
sense of their motives.  We then fail to see logical next steps or 
<BR>
obvious actions and reactions by the other side.  We become suprised 
<BR>
at events that should have been obvious.
<BR>
<P>I think that very few viewpoints are purely irrational.  They may be 
<BR>
based on false beliefs, but once you determine what those beliefs 
<BR>
are, most people are acting totally rationally within their world 
<BR>
view.  For example,the relgious zealot who interprets ancient 
<BR>
scripture as literally the word of God, should be easy to predict. 
<BR>
The imbalanced person who thinks UFO aliens are projecting 
<BR>
mind-control rays through the TV should be easy to predict.  We do 
<BR>
not have to avoid rational debate or predictive analysis of these 
<BR>
opponents in the mistaken belief that they are &quot;irrational&quot; and 
<BR>
therefore cannot be analyzed.
<BR>
<P>I think this characterization of opponents is usually more satisfying 
<BR>
than it is accurate.  In being inaccurate, it leads to an 
<BR>
underestimation of their skills, a misunderstanding of their motives, 
<BR>
and a total inability to anticipate their future actions.  All three 
<BR>
of these spell doom in any ideas-based conflict.
