<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oldgold stirring the pot
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oldgold, thanks for stirring our little pot of soup. Some stuff has gottent
<BR>
stuck at the bottom.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather that try to put Trail Guide's point across for him, which he does
<BR>
very well himself, I will just point out this:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. There has been a gold standard in effect through the 80s.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US overdrew its gold and the system collapsed. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. There has been a dual physical gold and paper gold standard since 1989
<BR>
or so. The US and UK overdrew this by 1997. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Asian collapse, though it would have happened eventually anyway, was
<BR>
a planned event that saved our sorry @$$es for three years. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The bulk of the dollar support mechanism (remember that we did not have
<BR>
a current account surplus in three decades) was a series of debt traps for
<BR>
various emerging nations that were indebted by tricks and by force. These
<BR>
debtors needed dollars to pay off interest on dollar loans so that they could
<BR>
buy life's basics on the global markets.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The idea of a debt derived money offering stability in economic function
<BR>
and in prices is an absurdity on the scale of defying gravity, absolving the
<BR>
world from Newton's law. Without an anchor in a commodity money, all debt money
<BR>
spirals out of control and into worthlessness. No conceivable system can make it
<BR>
otherwise. Gold is to finance and money as the speed of light is to Einstein's
<BR>
law of relativity. Gold answers the question &quot;relative to what?&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short: for a monetary system to work, someone, somewhere, must be able
<BR>
to exchange the currency for gold AT A FIXED RATE. We call this parity.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The global dollar debt system is collapsing. Soon, only the US and a few
<BR>
&quot;friends&quot; will be left owing dollars and owning the &quot;bag&quot; - our debt. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The system could not work if it was well known even among the top
<BR>
bankers, because their attempts to get into gold for defense against this would
<BR>
have killed the system. Even now, when it is apparent, bankers refuse to believe
<BR>
that their product is as toxic as RJR's and Columbia's main export combined (and
<BR>
they work in remarkably simillar ways).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, say thanks for the low gold and silver prices you are getting and
<BR>
pray that it can continue. Next thanksgiving tell your familly to give thanks to
<BR>
the Germans, Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, Indians, Italians and others who feed
<BR>
and clothe us half the time (actually 56% in 1998, 60% in 1999).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------------------------
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some details and discussion follow:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have fought a war and have lost it. The war that was fought was for
<BR>
financial hegemony through the issue of the reserve currency for the world. In
<BR>
essence making the US serve the role of banker to the world. The war was lost in
<BR>
1968 and defeat conceded in 1971 and again in 1973. With much support from a
<BR>
world scared of a complete freeze-up of commerce, the dollar was resuscitated
<BR>
just in the nick of time and a new gold convertibility standard was put together
<BR>
by the same bankers that pushed for and got the Fed and then Bretton Woods. JP
<BR>
Morgan said &quot;gold is the only money&quot;. He said so well into the Fed's life when
<BR>
gold was no longer circulating in great volumes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiat debt money is incapable of maintaining value without a fix to a real
<BR>
item - notably the precious metals, and the most prominent of them, gold. The
<BR>
dollar is two different things at the same time. Within the US is only a product
<BR>
of debt, the IOUs of all us credit card using and mortgage and car loan paying
<BR>
people that the bank sells to the producers of the houses, goods, autos we buy
<BR>
with &quot;credit&quot;. Outside the US, the dollar is much the same, until it meets the
<BR>
BIS for transnational settlements of imbalances. There, the central banks trade
<BR>
gold for dollars at an unknown exchange rate much greater than that in the
<BR>
markets.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This is a premium that is payed for the right to buy gold rather than the
<BR>
gold itself - this way it is kept off the books). The private markets provide
<BR>
the non-US  private bankers an opportunity to hedge their dollar assets and
<BR>
those of their clients. The US banks and their UK allies produce the paper gold
<BR>
needed for settlements of dollars into gold debt.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that someone - somewhere - can settle over $100 billion dollars in
<BR>
unbalance &quot;imbalance of payments&quot; every year with gold, is what makes the
<BR>
dollar's value relatively stable. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US and UK bankers had completely overstepped their bounds in the
<BR>
process and issued way more paper gold than there could ever be redeemed (the
<BR>
BIS and OCC statistics just deal with derivative contracts, these are just
<BR>
mirrors of a much larger gold banking system which underlies trade and at which
<BR>
gold settles the dollar through the SDR). So long as the gold credits were
<BR>
believed to be redeemable, the system was credible. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it lost credibility, in 1996 - 1997, the imperative became the classic
<BR>
wildcat bank strategy of moving the gold in the back door when the inspector
<BR>
comes to look at your reserves, and transfering it to the next bank just as the
<BR>
inspector is on his way there. The whole dynamic is now the satisfaction of gold
<BR>
demand by whatever means necessary so as to maintain credibility of the paper
<BR>
and thus prevent a &quot;bank run&quot;. The Washington Agreement was the statement by the
<BR>
EU that they will not put in jeopardy any more of their gold, that their part in
<BR>
the dollar support system is over. Since that date, the US has been exporting
<BR>
some 800 tons of gold (annual rate) officially, and an unknown ammount &quot;below
<BR>
custom's radar&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the bankers in the EU and the UK have been redeeming their
<BR>
gold liabilities to their clients with American gold liabilities. When actual
<BR>
gold ran out and gold yet to be mined (or found or explored for) was used for
<BR>
settlement, some time in the late 80s, this part of the dollar support system
<BR>
was born. The part US banks played was (at first) small, US market share in gold
<BR>
banking was some 20% in 1995. By 1997, it passed 35%, by mid 99- over 42%, now
<BR>
it probably passed the 50% mark according to OCC numbers (BIS numbers for the
<BR>
end of 99 will only come out in June). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process reflects the change of responsibility for managing the dollar
<BR>
from the losers of WWII to the &quot;winner&quot;. The Fed is responsible for the
<BR>
viability of the liabilities of US banks. These liabilities are what we call
<BR>
dollars if banks can't supply dollars they owe, the Fed supplies them through
<BR>
the treasury and directly.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold liabilities of US banks are quickly growing so that they will soon
<BR>
hold all of the dollar side of the global dollar-gold settlement system. When
<BR>
the transfer of gold liability from the UK to the US is complete, there will no
<BR>
longer be any reason for Europe and the Oil nations, nor China to assist in
<BR>
controling the gold ecxhange rate. At that point, the gold obligations will be
<BR>
terminated and gold contracts and accounts drawn on US banks will be settled in
<BR>
dollars only. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time for that is not here yet. I would venture a guess at the time
<BR>
frame of the end of this year. At current rates, the transfer should be finished
<BR>
by then.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms for the end of the game were set, in part, in the early 80s.
<BR>
Since then, there had been a tremendous effort by the US government to stop use
<BR>
of American resources by American and foreign consumers. Major finds of gas, and
<BR>
particularly, oil were capped and not allowed to go into production. Forest
<BR>
lands were set aside from loggers. Gold mines were induced not to explore nor
<BR>
produce gold within the US. Why? So that when the end does come, the US will
<BR>
have cash traded commodities to sell - so that when the US can't buy on dollar
<BR>
credit anymore, it will have something to trade while the country is
<BR>
reindustrialized. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US tried to play the technology card by assisting US tech companies in
<BR>
gaining investments, that was done by making them appear more attractive to
<BR>
investors through SEC and IRS accounting rules regarding ESOPs and merger
<BR>
accounting that lower the cash costs of top talent and make losses seem like
<BR>
earnings. But the &quot;social adjustment&quot; oriented school system produces mostly
<BR>
good salespeople and hamburger flippers. India has more programmers than Silicon
<BR>
Valley, and Taiwan and Singapore produce more chips. The best computer and
<BR>
software design is done in Ireland and the Norse countries, and wireless
<BR>
technology is mostly a Finnish, British and German industry. The only way to
<BR>
eliminate the disadvatage in education is to import as many tech pros as we can
<BR>
before they stop wanting to come here. If 10 million 30-35 year old techies can
<BR>
be imported over the next 5-10 years, the US may have a chance to survive as the
<BR>
major economy.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bank debt reports published by the BIS and the IMF tell the story in
<BR>
all of its gorey statistical details. The dollar debt outside the US is
<BR>
collapsing as it is turned from emerging market and transnational corporate debt
<BR>
into American debt. The US imports produce a flood of dollars that pay off the
<BR>
liabilities of Emerging nation's corporations, governments and banks. It is the
<BR>
need by these to repay dollar loans that has produced demand for dollars abroad.
<BR>
Now that they no longer borrow in quantity and have been reducing their debt,
<BR>
these countries are slowly reducing the international value of the dollar and
<BR>
adding themselves to the long list of dollar creditors. The only dollar debtors
<BR>
left are the UK, some HIPCs, and the greatest debtor ever, the US.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story is simple. The debt trap set for the emerging markets by 3%
<BR>
dollar interest rates in the early nineties, was sprung in 1997 by a joint
<BR>
effort of the Fed, the IMF and the BIS. The IMF demanded self destructive
<BR>
policies from the countries it was supposed to help, the BIS raised their bank's
<BR>
reserve requirements (actually it was their net asset ratios - a.k.a. ccapital
<BR>
adequacy - but few understand what that is and reserves are a close enough
<BR>
descriptor), and the Fed raised interest rates by all of 1/4% and the whole
<BR>
Asian economic system collapsed.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This generated the requisite dollar demand, stopped Asian gold demand,
<BR>
produced an Asian gold supply, and allowed EU and US banks to buy out many Asian
<BR>
corporation's assets that they were barred from owning before. Hyena and Vulture
<BR>
LP had their day. We were spared disaster for another three years.
