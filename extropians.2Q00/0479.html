<EM>&gt; &gt;[A]s a matter of simple textual construction and logic, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;don't think you can look to the IXth amendment as a SOURCE of rights.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;think the most we can say is 1) that it's not inconsistent with rights that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;arise from or have their legal authority in some other source and 2) that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;from this we can safely imply that the Founders believed that there were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;other sources of human rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That strikes me as utterly sound.  The 9th does not create rights but merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limits in certain ways the power of statists (federal ones at first and now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thanks to incorporation via the 14th Amendment, state, too).  Or, to put it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another way, the 9th embodies the Founders' view that state power operates as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an exception to the default rule of individual liberty, an island in a sea of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>That was ultimately my own position. I look at the 9th as being an
<BR>
undefined default set of rights that are recognised as residing in the
<BR>
individual.
<BR>
<P>The 10th deals with 'powers', rather than 'rights', which I'm not
<BR>
legally versed enough to know exactly what the two terms may have in
<BR>
common, but that was the basis of my conception that the 9th dealt with
<BR>
the residual natural rights of the individual, while the 10th dealt with
<BR>
reserving undefined governmental powers to the states and the people,
<BR>
for them to hash out amongst themselves as to what government powers are
<BR>
to be run at the state, county, or local level.
