<EM>&gt; A full Web store on a cell phone does not make sense for multiple

<EM>&gt; part, it looks like people are still identifying uses for this; there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does not (yet) appear to be a killer app for wireless ecommerce.

<P>The killer application is not yet available to the m-commerce providers.

<P>The killer application is the cell you're in. The telco knows it (in order
<BR>
to route your calls), but they're not disclosing it. If they disclose it
<BR>
(with or without the mobile user's permission) then any application that
<BR>
can be bolted on top of a GIS suddenly becomes a potential ASP-delivered
<BR>
service.
<BR>
<P>In some cases, these will synergise with existing technologies. For example,
<BR>
a bus company might use wireless cellphones to boost its sales of bus
<BR>
tickets by providing a query tool. You phone it and say &quot;I want to get to
<BR>
(x,y) as fast as possible&quot;. It checks the bus routes, checks its list of
<BR>
where each bus is, and figures out the fastest possible route for you from
<BR>
(a) to (b), possibly even reserving a seat for you in accordance with
<BR>
your customer preferences profile on their service. Maybe they even tell
<BR>
the bus driver to pull over and let you hop on board somewhere between
<BR>
stops -- after all, they know you're a paying customer (as you paid for
<BR>
your journey by phone!). 
<BR>
<P>Take it a step further and you can combine this with taxi, train, and 
<BR>
air booking systems to provide ultra-streamlined public transport: punch
<BR>
in your destination and it will get you there as fast as possible, by
<BR>
any means necessary.
