<EM>&gt; &gt;       2) The authors report their results suggest that an altered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  expression profile of genes involved in mitosis occurs with age,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  and that these changes result in increased rates of *somatic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  mutation, leading to numerical and structural *chromosome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  aberrations and mutations that manifest themselves as an aging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  phenotype.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; [snip]

<P>Note that they are talking only about *mitosis*, which is only
<BR>
going to apply to epithelial tissue (skin, stomach/gut, lungs),
<BR>
blood components (esp. immune system) and other tissues derived
<BR>
from slowly dividing (liver in some cases) or stem cell lines
<BR>
(perhaps a very low level in the brain).
<BR>
<P>Many of your major terminally differentiated organs: heart,
<BR>
pancreas, kidney, most of the brain *are not* covered by their
<BR>
conclusions.
<BR>
<P>I would put the conclusions in the Dysdifferentiation and/or Error
<BR>
Catastrophe theories of aging.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This seems to be a very fruitful line of research that may lead to a good 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insight consistent with the common sense experience of aging as a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deterioration of many bodily functions and structures on a broad front at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different rates.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, I've been of the opinion for more than 5 years if you know what
<BR>
is going on in the cell at the gene expression level, you will be
<BR>
able to understand the treatments necessary to push the cell back
<BR>
to a &quot;youthful&quot; pattern (if the program is mostly intact!).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Assuming this is borne out, what kinds of strategies to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; combat this phenomena occurr to our resident biomed experts?
</EM><BR>
<P>It really depends on the cause.  It isn't clear how they conclude
<BR>
somatic mutation rates are increased, but if so (and I've always
<BR>
been partial to this theory), it means the only *real* solution
<BR>
is to replace the genome.  That requires hard nanotech and is
<BR>
discussed in Nanomedicine.  It isn't spelled out, but the
<BR>
implication I see from Sections 10.4.2 (Mechanical Cytocide
<BR>
and Virucide), 9.3.5 (Materials Disassembly for Disposal)
<BR>
and 9.5.4 (Nucleography) is that you can remove the old
<BR>
grungy (highly specific medical terminology here) DNA and
<BR>
synthesize new DNA from tapes kept onboard the nanobots.
<BR>
I've had private conversations with Robert Freitas about
<BR>
this and I think it will be discussed in further detail in
<BR>
subsequent Nanomedicine volumes and/or future papers.
<BR>
<P>Prior to the hard nanotech era (with good engineering capabilities),
<BR>
you should be able to get some spin control on the failures
<BR>
that are occuring with supplemental nuclei in the form of
<BR>
bacteria engineered to produce non-mutated RNA's at the right
<BR>
point in the cell cycle.  The problem will be the limited
<BR>
carrying capacity of bacterial genomes for augmenting human
<BR>
genome program failures.  Applying &quot;gene therapy&quot; patches
<BR>
with specific virus-derived machinery might be possible,
<BR>
but given the large number of possible mutations, the
<BR>
simple volume of engineering required is probably
<BR>
prohibitive (you need tens of thousands of &quot;correctors&quot;
<BR>
to replace various damaged genes).
<BR>
<P>Finally, you have whole organ replacement.  This is for example
<BR>
feasible with bone marrow transplants (for immune system
<BR>
reconstitution) or skin today (with some minor details still to be
<BR>
resolved like hair follicles).  Of course this involves fairly
<BR>
invasive and expensive procedures currently.
<BR>
<P>It is worth noting that people who are *serious* about anti-aging
<BR>
should go to the trouble of either getting some blood and/or
<BR>
bone marrow frozen (the bone marrow contains lots of hematopoetic
<BR>
stem cells, the blood has low but detectable concentrations)
<BR>
so they could use it in the future to treat the age-related decline
<BR>
of the immune system.  Skin plugs would get some fibroblasts
<BR>
and muscle biopsies might get some myoblasts, that are useful
<BR>
for regrowing other tissues.
<BR>
<P>I know that there are companies that provide such services.
<BR>
Our medical experts and/or super-sleuths might want to investigate
<BR>
and organize a page of sources for such treatments that we can add
<BR>
to the ExI website.  IMO, such pre-aged preparations are at least
<BR>
as important as popping a bunch of antioxidants every morning, though
<BR>
they are more time consuming and expensive.
