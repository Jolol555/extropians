<P>
My Congressman, Rep. Charlie Bass, emailed me today with his weekly newsletter,
<BR>
which included this news:
<BR>
<P>House Votes to Ban Per-Minute Internet Access Charges
<BR>
<P>The House voted this week to strip the Federal Communications Commission
<BR>
(FCC) of the ability to impose per-minute Internet access charges.
<BR>
Currently, Internet service providers are not subject to per-minute fees;
<BR>
however, under current regulations, there is nothing to prevent the FCC from
<BR>
imposing these fees in the future.
<BR>
<P>The Internet Access Charge Prohibition Act (H.R.1291) would block the FCC's
<BR>
ability to impose per-minute charges on consumers' Internet access services,
<BR>
when those charges are intended to support universal service. Under a
<BR>
per-minute fee, in addition to membership fees charged by companies for
<BR>
Internet access, consumers would be charged an additional fee for every
<BR>
minute they are connected to the Internet.
<BR>
<P>If Internet users were charged by the minute when they surfed the web or
<BR>
e-mailed their friends and family, it would drastically increase the cost,
<BR>
and dramatically inhibit the use, of the Internet.  This bill would help
<BR>
keep the Internet affordable for all Americans.
<BR>
<P>It's good to see these guys can get something right.
<BR>
<P>Mike Lorrey
