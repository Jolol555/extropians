<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How arrogant, at this point, for neurologists and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pharmaco-psychologists to dismiss Freud, when they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have so much trouble explaining concepts like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-identity, sanity, or even pleasure!
</EM><BR>
<P>To put it mildly.
<BR>
<P>But, actually, the main thing that Freud is valuable for, in my
<BR>
view, is understanding irrationality. For an extremely
<BR>
interesting, philosophically rigorous account of the
<BR>
psychoanalytic account of irrationality, see Sebastian Gardner's
<BR>
_Irrationality and the Philosophy of Psychoanalysis_. I have a
<BR>
few bones to pick with the book (which Jonathan Lear captured in
<BR>
his review of it  -- don't know where the review was published).
<BR>
But it's the best defense of psychoanalysis I've seen.
<BR>
<P>The idea that Freud &quot;has been proved wrong in nearly all of his
<BR>
notions,&quot; as Usha Lee McFarling states, is absurd.
<BR>
<P>McFarling also writes:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Freud's legacy has largely migrated from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientific realm to the cultural.
</EM><BR>
<P>And he's wrong in this realm as well? Or is it that he's right,
<BR>
but this realm &quot;doesn't count&quot;?
<BR>
<P>Reminds me of people who say that Nietzsche (eternal recurrence)
<BR>
will be &quot;proved wrong&quot; if the universe turns out not to have
<BR>
enough mass to keep it from expanding forever.
<BR>
<P>I know Extropians and trans-humanists love this &quot;3rd culture&quot;
<BR>
business, but sheesh, this Freud-bashing is utterly ignorant.
<BR>
<P><P>Mind you, some of my best friends are trans-humanists!
<BR>
<P>But when TOG comes knocking at my door, trying to take away my
<BR>
constitutionally guaranteed right to free thought (by trying to
<BR>
banish &quot;2nd culture&quot;), they'll be in for a big surprise!
<BR>
<P>I'll be packin a mean can o' philosophical WHOOP-ASS!!
<BR>
<P>Love,
<BR>
Brian
