<EM>&gt; It was quite evident that nanotech is gaining steam. Technanogy sponsored

<EM>&gt; computers). Their first project is &quot;nano aluminum&quot;, which in its first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application is the creation of super high thrust solid rocket fuel. Think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; single stage to orbit at $50 to 100 a pound. But for starters they are

<EM>&gt; working on refitting stingers and other conventional weapons.

<P>Nanopowdered aluminum is not all that remarkable- there's a product
<BR>
called AlEx or some such which is nanoscale aluminum powder made by
<BR>
exploding a wire with a capacitor discharge in a helium atmosphere.  It
<BR>
has a slightly positive heat of formation relative to bulk Al, but solid
<BR>
fuels are inherently a poor match for orbital launch- you get better Isp
<BR>
and effective bulk density out of liquid fuels, and for SSTO or even a
<BR>
cheap TSTO, delta-V is most important.  Solids are great for tactical
<BR>
propulsion (ie missiles) but just can't compete with liquids for system
<BR>
bulk density, mass fraction, and Isp.
<BR>
<P>One problem with metallized solid propellants for tactical missiles is
<BR>
&quot;signature&quot;- they burn *damn* hot and have a very bright plume (consider
<BR>
the shuttle SRBs).  This serves to warn the target that you've just
<BR>
launched, enabling him to take countermeasures.  A major focus in new
<BR>
hypervelocity missile developement is low-observable propulsion, which
<BR>
has a purely gaseous exhaust with low luminosity.
