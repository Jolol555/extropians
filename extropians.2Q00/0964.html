<BR>
<P>============================================
<BR>
S W E E T,    S A V A G E    R O B O T
<BR>
<P>On a certain morning, a robot named Bruce Diode sat at breakfast with his
<BR>
wife Sally.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were not a happy couple.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the entire Milky Way, each day of your life, beings plight their
<BR>
troth, break their hearts, howl methane tears, twist their soaked lace
<BR>
hankies, smurge and make up, and generally end by loodling one another
<BR>
under cover (as it might be) of the Great Whistling Moon's descent.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true even on Alpha Grommett, the sole known world inhabited by
<BR>
machines.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing animate stirs there, not even a mouse. Mice were the first to go
<BR>
on Alpha Grommett, which was infested by the descendants of a single better
<BR>
mousetrap left behind by a careless visitor.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I say 'nothing animate'? Not strictly true. Since 1937, a stocky green
<BR>
lizard from Gamma Globulin has held an important post with the principal
<BR>
newspaper in the capital city, Rock-Breaks-Scissors.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few know her true name. Fewer still realize that their favourite daily
<BR>
columnist is organic.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machines bleed, of course, in their fashion. Lubricating pumps break with
<BR>
unrequited love. Passion as well as Boolean logic seethes within anodised
<BR>
chests.  Murders and deeds of wild romance are done at lust's behest. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet somehow mechanisms simply never rise to the empathy required of an
<BR>
advice columnist. Only an organic intelligence can pen a solid Miss
<BR>
Lonely-Hearts column.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Alpha Grommett, therefore, a retired upper-middle class reptile named
<BR>
Mrs Emilia Aardwimble reigns as the Heart-Balm queen for a whole world of
<BR>
tortured mechanisms. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I may be an old fool,&quot; observed Mr Diode, at breakfast. &quot;You are a frowdy
<BR>
old fool.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spooned graphite, holding open his novel with a second elbow and
<BR>
slurping light lubricant from a can held in a third. Between spoonfuls he
<BR>
expertly ground, polished and inserted a fresh lens in his hind optic.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Habit had long since worn the edge from Mrs Diode's indignation.
<BR>
&quot;Sometimes I wonder why I ever married--&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;--an insensitive brute like you,&quot; Bruce Diode intoned with her, attention
<BR>
fixed on his book, lost in a glamorous if dangerous world of sharp crims
<BR>
and tough PIs.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally Diode sighed and folded the morning paper to her favourite column.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You should be glad anyone married you,&quot; Bruce said absently, varying the
<BR>
formula. His hand touched the discharge tube, guided it to his ventral
<BR>
valve, clicked it in. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flooding through the dome, the brilliant X-rays of Alpha Grommett's sun
<BR>
glazed his cabinet. Bruce Diode resembled a treadle-driven Singer sewing
<BR>
machine, with random additions from tasteless Japanese war toys, set on
<BR>
four fat little worn wheels. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife Sally looked more like an Art Deco radio set, the kind that glows
<BR>
like burnished wood and smells like hot Bakelite as it warms up, with a
<BR>
dial yellow and soothing as the purr of a tabbycat, station-call
<BR>
designations lettered beautifully on the illuminated half-circle of the
<BR>
dial and big chunky knobs to control sound and tone. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bruce! That's what Meg Kindheart says here to 'Fed Up'.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tabloid, open at For the Love-Lorn, fell with the snapping sound of
<BR>
abruptly folded paper. She studied her rusting husband intently.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's have no more from that damned fool creature,&quot; Bruce said sharply.
<BR>
Though his vexation derived principally from Sally's disregard of breakfast
<BR>
tradition, it was also true that if there was one thing he loathed above
<BR>
all others, it was parlour psychology.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Self-taught drivel,&quot; he sneered.  &quot;She should be deactivated for
<BR>
practicing witchcraft without a licence.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Really, Bruce!&quot; Sally was secretly glad of a break in their normative
<BR>
programming. &quot;Meg Kindheart is the most sensible machine in the world.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A lot you'd know about 'sense'.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Diode crackled a circuit breaker in a marked manner. &quot;It's a pity
<BR>
there aren't more machines that show an interest in others.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The office cleaning-bug probably writes her rubbish.&quot; That stung. &quot;If
<BR>
it's not some rusted-out old derrick that missed her chance fifty years
<BR>
ago.&quot;  He clapped his hat on. &quot;There's no one like a non-replicating
<BR>
artifact to make free with advice.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers on Sally's dial bleached. Her manipulators opened and closed
<BR>
convulsively.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You -- you old bucket!&quot; she screamed, and fled from the room.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruce Diode sighed angrily as the door slammed, and spun his optic back to
<BR>
the clock. With a curse he found he was late. He scraped paint from his
<BR>
blower as he coupled to the traction. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally, for her part, winced at the crash of the traction's gears. Bruce
<BR>
was in a particularly unpleasant mood. Sighing, she returned to the lube
<BR>
bench and gathered the nozzles together. She consulted her own internal
<BR>
clock. He would be late for work. Sally flung the nozzles into the cleaning
<BR>
unit.  Why did he have to go on like that? It hadn't been this way when
<BR>
they were first married. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-pity dopplered through her. She picked up the paper and finished Meg
<BR>
Kindheart. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nozzles popped up shining and clean, and the emptiness of her life
<BR>
assailed her with crushing force.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, the same recursive routine. She'd become a drudge! Angrily, she
<BR>
damped her overload. What right did Bruce have to destroy her dreams? He
<BR>
didn't love her any more, that was certain. All he ever thought about was
<BR>
his stupid trashy novels, his policemen and secret agents and steely PIs.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An awful possibility popped up into her temporary cache memory. Could
<BR>
Bruce be having an affair with some letter-quality job in the office? Some
<BR>
fast, two-directional operator?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A megabyte of ghastly, lurid bit-mapped images cascaded through her high
<BR>
core. It didn't bear thinking about. Sally bent over the bench and gave
<BR>
herself up to her misery and shame.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon enough, her outburst ran its course. She re-booted, rolled to a
<BR>
mirror, regarded her artful if dated cabinet, the warm vacuum-tube glow at
<BR>
the back of her yellow dial.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not that old,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Nowhere near the scrap heap, dash it.&quot;
<BR>
A fierce determination glowed in her deepest circuits. &quot;I'll put a spoke in
<BR>
his wheel,&quot; she told her image.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as her optics swung past the side-panels of the mirror a cruel ray of
<BR>
Alpha Grommett's sun caught her worn knobs and tatty grille. Courage waned.
<BR>
She needed moral support for her new stand.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Meg Kindheart!&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally Diode dashed to the modem and began pouring out her poor mechanical
<BR>
soul, all unknowing, to a lizard from steamy Gamma Globulin. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By midday, the office temperature was in the high hundreds. Bruce Diode,
<BR>
despite his insulation and regulation blowers, was frazzled and short of
<BR>
temper.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, he knew, in the mercury pools and mineral tailings, young
<BR>
machines cavorted under the roasting sun and thought of nothing but love,
<BR>
fun and self-replication.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Bruce, sockets running with oil, the day was the pit of hell.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All morning long, from its inauspicious beginning, he'd felt utterly
<BR>
miserable. He and Sally were well and truly stuck in a rut. He'd been
<BR>
denying this truth for years. Now it was unavoidable.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Blast!&quot; he muttered on the short-wave local band. &quot;Damn and blast!&quot;
<BR>
Several juniors raised their optics, shrank back to their terminals when he
<BR>
caught them at it. In a pet, he threw his files back into storage and seethed.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bitch Meg Kindheart, he thought. She'd know what was amiss in his
<BR>
marriage. She'd give him a five line solution that could mean anything or
<BR>
nothing. He leaned back wearily, letting his hind springs take the weight
<BR>
for a change. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspiration struck like a glitch from heaven.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;William?&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kid at the next work station shunted his optics cautiously. &quot;Yes, Mr
<BR>
Diode?&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My boy, can you lend me your copy of the Intelligencer for half a mo'?&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure.&quot; The young mechanism looked relieved that he was not going to be
<BR>
shouted at. He fished inside his leg. &quot;Here, sir.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruce nodded curtly, turned aside so nobody could see over his shoulder,
<BR>
found For the Love-Lorn.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The office clock beamed out the midday break. Everyone but Bruce rose and
<BR>
left the room. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Diode drew a keyboard toward him and began a biting letter to the
<BR>
meddling machine he loathed so much.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finest Heart-Balm columnist in the universe was, at that very moment,
<BR>
examining her bulletin board. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day's dreadful temperatures had dropped only a little, but inside her
<BR>
steamy, climate-set module on Alpha Grommett the stout green lizard crossed
<BR>
the room from her escritoire to draw the mica curtains.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halfway through her first millennium, Mrs Emilia Aardwimble had retired
<BR>
from her position as Matron of Eggs after a massive cholesterol-induced
<BR>
heart attack, followed by intermittent cardiac troubles. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casting about for an interest, she chanced during a long recuperative
<BR>
galactic tour upon the unusual machine city of Rock-Breaks-Scissors, with
<BR>
which for reasons not even she could explain she fell instantly in love.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it was the boom and clack, the humming industry.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the unorthodox beauty of an entire planet restricted by no
<BR>
ecological niceties, so that poisonous but lovely fumes gusted ceaselessly
<BR>
across a sky like beaten egg-yolk (though this was scarcely an image Mrs
<BR>
Aardwimble would have permitted to linger within her conscious awareness)
<BR>
and delirious young mechanisms sported merrily in mineral tailings so
<BR>
carcinogenic they'd instantly bring cancers boiling through the lung and
<BR>
digestive tract of any unprotected creature based on the carbon molecule.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for a moment, Mrs Aardwimble stood at her triple-sealed window,
<BR>
gazing at the flaring yellow sky and the viridescent angular shapes of the
<BR>
city. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A breezy tornado came off the liquid mercury sea, raising a purple haze,
<BR>
carrying to her ears through the sturdy walls of her life-support module
<BR>
the happy bleats and pitterings of machines at play.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emilia smiled to see their happiness, but her smile grew wistful as she
<BR>
remembered the thousands who did not share it.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, she turned her great green mass, pivoting awesomely on her tail,
<BR>
and returned to her screen's index of tragic letters.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these communications were too intimate and shocking to answer
<BR>
through the newspaper. Meg Kindheart always sent personal replies to these
<BR>
letters, direct, via the Ethernet. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she sat down again in the huge hydraulic chair with its slot cut for
<BR>
her tail, she glanced, as always, at the umber hologram of her four
<BR>
hatchlings and the grandchildren. Fervently, Mrs Emilia Aardwimble thanked
<BR>
the Great Whistling Moon that the kids had grown up healthy, strong and
<BR>
happy. If only--
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Brian Aardwimble's face smiled poignantly from one of the earliest
<BR>
of the holograms, breaking her heart.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian, the brilliant saurian musician, the master of contrapuntal
<BR>
warbling, the prodigy who had died so tragically young.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Mrs Aardwimble and her inseminator knew the anguish of their
<BR>
mistakes, of forcing Brian in the egg, of demands imposed in the long
<BR>
dreaming years within its leathery shell, years which they had made a
<BR>
nightmare of competitive pressure and premature peer rivalry.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet out of suffering, she knew, gazing at his young likeness, comes a
<BR>
measure of wisdom.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighing, Mrs Aardwimble called up the first pleading cry for help.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter was from a young mechanism, already in the throes of
<BR>
replication after a thoughtless bout of solitary self-loodling, driven to
<BR>
distraction by its predicament. It was thinking of erasing its ROM chip.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wrench, Mrs Aardwimble looked again at Brian's portrait, and away.
<BR>
Carefully, choosing her words with precision, she wrote a message of solace
<BR>
to the pregnant machine. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not appear in the Intelligencer. This was a personal life-line, a
<BR>
work of organic love.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next letter was from an ageing housebot, a rather silly, selfish mech
<BR>
who wanted all the answers without any of the effort. Yet she at least had
<BR>
a dream, one she wished Meg Kindheart to endorse, even if it was a
<BR>
heedless, feckless dream. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sought approval to leave her spouse and escape with some shining hero
<BR>
of fantasy, something along the lines of Francis Coppola's dreadful movie
<BR>
One From The Heart but with a more rosy ending. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big lizard eased her buttocks and put her snout into her cupped claws.
<BR>
For the moment, she returned the letter to its holding register.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen letters down the stack she came on the mirror image of Mrs Diode's.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It began sarcastically, even rudely. Mrs Aardwimble was tempted to delete
<BR>
it from memory, but hesitated because of an element of loss, of genuine
<BR>
frustration behind the bitterness.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine which had input these words was disappointed with marriage,
<BR>
with his career, with everything. The final challenge was ironic, but Mrs
<BR>
Aardwimble responded to the unhappy aspiration beneath it:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you suggest, Miss Heal-All Kindfart, that I should leave my little
<BR>
hausfrau and seek a True Love in the great wide world?&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Emilia Aardwimble was not without a deeply compassionate sense of
<BR>
humour. Giggling to herself, she called back the earlier letter into an
<BR>
adjacent window and sat considering her replies.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*    
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky over Rock-Breaks-Scissors was violently violet, tinged with a
<BR>
grey stolid enough to be edible.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruce Diode leaned against the leaf-spring shock absorbers of his traction
<BR>
line, zipping home. The volcanoes had brought dreadful weather the past few
<BR>
weeks. High above the carbon dioxide atmosphere, clouds of sulphuric acid
<BR>
swept across the countryside, pouring down as dreary corrosive rain each
<BR>
night and ruining the children's outdoor games.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruce was, frankly, more relaxed and at ease with himself than he'd been
<BR>
for years, though his cabinet tingled and surged with excited expectation.
<BR>
He hadn't felt this way since his courtship, and even that had been a
<BR>
rigid, controlled business.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagerly, Mr Diode anticipated the joys of getting home from work.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of robots clipping on and off the traction came to a ragged halt
<BR>
at an earthquake fracture. While the repairbots spurted out their
<BR>
quick-setting crystal bridgework, Bruce jounced impatiently against his
<BR>
springs.  His eyes rolled inside his cabinet, read once more the latest
<BR>
letter from his secret sweetheart.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My darling,&quot; ran the words across his inward screen, &quot;I cannot imagine
<BR>
how I lived before we met. But that's silly, isn't it? --because we have
<BR>
not met. Or perhaps we have, perhaps our chips were etched by the same
<BR>
Xaser, doped from the same source, and perhaps in these bytes we take from
<BR>
each other a link has been forged between two wild spirits.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copper greens of the buildings nearby shivered with light even though
<BR>
the sun was setting. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruce Diode shivered, too, with besotted love.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I like to believe that we are the only two of our model, stamped out as a
<BR>
pair, the blueprint zeroed. O my love, my yet-nameless love, can we not go
<BR>
together into that world of our dreams where I summon you now only during
<BR>
off-peak inactivation? Impossible? I cannot believe it. . .&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenderly, Bruce sent the magic bits back to enciphered safe keeping.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A splatter of drops fell, and the traction system raised its perfunctory
<BR>
shields. Bruce felt like crying aloud with bitter-sweet rejoicing.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rain,&quot; his lover had written, &quot;how like the pain which falls in cruel
<BR>
droplets when love is lost. Something my husband could never understand--&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Bruce growled to himself, damn the big dumb insensitive brute.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so on and so forth.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'll understand,&quot; Meg Kindheart had written to him, &quot;why I cannot
<BR>
publish this letter. But I see a way to help you. You deem yourself married
<BR>
to the wrong mechanism. Why, then, let me introduce you to a 'bot suffering
<BR>
the same agonies, someone you might love if only I can bring you together.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bless her, he thought.  He grunted a form of greeting as he entered the
<BR>
house, but there was no reply. No doubt Sally was visiting one of her vapid
<BR>
friends. He'd have to make do with the leavings from the morning sump.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One light burned in his study, on the bulletin board. He rolled forward on
<BR>
his fat little wheels, extensors quivering, and jacked in.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not from his lover. Disappointment crushed him briefly, to be
<BR>
replaced by new excitement. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a note from Meg Kindheart.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An invitation to Scissors Heights! For dinner! This very evening!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zealously, he scrubbed down his cabinet and polished his lenses.
<BR>
Scampering like a young mech, he dashed for the outbound traction and
<BR>
plugged in.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bald wheels spinning free, he plunged toward his destiny.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*    
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no point in laboring this, I trust?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big elegantly dressed lizard met Bruce at the door.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he was led in to the steamy, somewhat uncomfortable living room.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he found himself staring at a large worn Art Deco radio, whom he
<BR>
saved from pitching on its dial with a deft sweep of his extensor.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he tweetered like a fool and broadcast all over the place while Mrs
<BR>
Emilia Aardwimble withdrew graciously from the room.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Poor Sally,&quot; Bruce Diode thought, when he was capable of thinking the
<BR>
next thing. &quot;She looks as if she'll die of mortification.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he saw himself clearly, abandoning embarrassment, forgetting
<BR>
pettiness, seeing as well, before him, in the figure of his wife, the
<BR>
mechanism which had written those sweet, those savage letters.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'bot he had never known!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And somehow he sensed deep within his most hard-wired circuits that Sally
<BR>
was seeing him in the same perspective, seeing him as her shining
<BR>
servomech, that passionate machine which until now had always been afraid
<BR>
to speak its wonder and joy!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With darkly brooding sensuality, Bruce Diode rolled across the floor to
<BR>
his wife.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, and Sally looked back at him and saw a little funny machine like a
<BR>
Singer Sewer, and she forgave him the endless irritations, the selfishness,
<BR>
the private detective paperbacks, the humorless pedestrian dreariness of
<BR>
him, for he was, after all, and at last, her great and shining hero.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robots have no sense of the grotesque, I'm sorry to say. Extensors linked,
<BR>
Bruce and Sally Diode rolled side by side in pursuit of Mrs Emilia
<BR>
Aardwimble and their promised dinner.
