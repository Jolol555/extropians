<P><EM>    &gt;John the problem with this is that using plutonium and the tools he
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;suggested, the critical mass would not be assembled quickly enough.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ted Taylor disagrees with you and nobody on planet Earth knows more
<BR>
about the proper way to bring about critical mass than Ted Taylor.
<BR>
Remember, the shaped chemical charges needed to bring about implosion
<BR>
of the Plutonium sphere may have been very exotic in 1945 but it's
<BR>
routine today. You can buy shaped charges off the shelf or read in a book
<BR>
how to make your own.
<BR>
<P>In a recent interview Taylor pointed out that of the 10 or so (I've lost count)
<BR>
nations that have the bomb every one of them has been successful on the
<BR>
first shot.  He also said that of the thousand or so nuclear tests the USA
<BR>
has conducted only one (one of the few not made by Taylor) is classified as
<BR>
a complete dud. Taylor's bosses didn't forbid him from making his bomb
<BR>
because they thought it wouldn't work but because they thought it would.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Uranium is more forgiving than plutonium
</EM><BR>
<P>True, with U235 pre detonation is less of a problem than with Plutonium but
<BR>
it's also more expensive and you need more of it, with 80% pure U235
<BR>
(about the purest made) you'd need 44 pounds.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;so they were able to make Little Boy with  uranium: two cannons
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;firing plugs of U235 at each other.
</EM><BR>
<P>Little Boy only had one cannon, it fired a U235 slug into a U235 sphere
<BR>
welded on the muzzle. The cannon method was never used again.
