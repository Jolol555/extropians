<EM>&gt; Even normal existing aircraft get better than 2 mpg, Spike. Even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helicopters do better than that, not much better, but better. Can you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post your calcs?
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that, but let me put em in a spreadsheet format so anyone
<BR>
who is interested can play.
<BR>
<P>Regarding ordinary aircraft, I agree, however ordinary aircraft are
<BR>
not capable of vertical takeoff and landing.  Helicopters have much
<BR>
higher wing area and are therefore more efficient fliers.  The advertised
<BR>
version of the Moller aircar has the only real lifting surface that I can
<BR>
see arranged so far aft as to be practially useless for straight and
<BR>
level flight: it would need to rely on large amount of hard-won
<BR>
diverted thrust from the two forward ducted fans for lift.  What
<BR>
is that about?
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, there is a single-prop aircraft that has enough thrust to
<BR>
hang on its own propeller, that aerobatic hotrod that Wayne
<BR>
Handley crashed down in Salinas last year, the turbo raven.  That
<BR>
was something to see:  he could fly low and nose up, pull it to a stop,
<BR>
even go down slightly, then hit the throttle and go straight up.  Cooool!
<BR>
<P>But of course it has an enormous propeller for that sized craft
<BR>
and you lose efficiency as you reduce the size of the rotor,
<BR>
so it should not surprise us that the aircar, with half again
<BR>
the mass of the turbo-raven and those way small diameter
<BR>
rotors should be a ravenous devourer of fuel.
<BR>
<P>Regardless, if a clever mechanical engineer did manage to arrange
<BR>
a small VTOL like a miniaturized V22, it would still have its
<BR>
uses, even if its fuel economy is 2 MPG, for special purposes,
<BR>
such as an air ambulance for instance.
<BR>
<P>Mike, that 20 MPG number is a fantasy bud.  Otherwise
<BR>
its back to aerodynamics 101 for me.  {8^D  spike
