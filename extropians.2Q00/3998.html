<EM>&gt; I suppose I can see how her ideas on &quot;egoism&quot; might lead an
</EM><BR>
others-centered
<BR>
<EM>&gt; person (such as, apparently, yourself) to view her ideas this way.  In
</EM><BR>
fact,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; initially, her ideas struck me as narcissistic and selfish.  But I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gradually come to believe that narcissism and, particularly, selfishness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have traditionally gotten a bad rap.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think certain forms of selfishness and narcissism are bad, though
<BR>
enjoyment and perfection of one's self, to me, on the whole, are the point
<BR>
of life.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Coming from years of fundamentalist Christian indoctrination, I was
</EM><BR>
heavily
<BR>
<EM>&gt; on board the &quot;love your neighbor as yourself&quot; rap.  So when I came across
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Randian egoistic ideas I bristled.  But the more I thought about it, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more it seemed to me that an openly selfish person would (generally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speaking) be a more honest and productive member of society than someone
</EM><BR>
who
<BR>
<EM>&gt; proclaims to be all about loving others, helping the less fortunate, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>I see nothing wrong with helping others and most Objectivists would agree.
<BR>
The thing is this is not a primary source of moral worth, nor should it be
<BR>
the center of one's existence.  Still, I do think it impinges somewhat on
<BR>
one's self worth.  After all, those who are immune to the _undeserved_
<BR>
sufferings of others are not to be esteemed.  (Note the word &quot;undeserved&quot;
<BR>
there.  Generosity and assistance should be aimed at those whose misfortune
<BR>
is not of their own orchestration and especially when it can improve them --
<BR>
as opposed to those who are evil or when it will only bring more harm.  In
<BR>
other words, don't buy a drunk a drink.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why more honest?  Well, as I see it, do-gooders one and all are not in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business of doing good for others for the sake of others, so much as for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their own sake.  For many people, sacrificing for other people makes
</EM><BR>
*them*
<BR>
<EM>&gt; feel good.  Take me for instance.  I work hard all week and make a pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good income and, if I splurged it all on me, I could live a pretty high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lifestyle.  But instead I spend the bulk of my income on educating my
</EM><BR>
kids,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; providing them (and my wife) with a home, and investing the money (in
</EM><BR>
part)
<BR>
<EM>&gt; so that my family is financially secure.  (Admittedly I'm also saving for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *me* too, so I don't have to work until I'm 80, but you get the point.)
</EM><BR>
So
<BR>
<EM>&gt; why do I &quot;sacrifice&quot; my own immediate pleasure for the sake of those I
</EM><BR>
love?
<BR>
<EM>&gt;   Well, primarily because it makes *me* feel good about myself.  I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel like a louse if I didn't provide for my kids.  Yes, in fact I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *be* a louse -- but the point is if I could *be* a louse without *feeling*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a louse I just might go for it.  But if you ask most people why they
</EM><BR>
do
<BR>
<EM>&gt; good for others they will most likely tell you they are doing it just to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefit others, as opposed making themselves feel better about themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not ot mention, I would hope, you love them.  (I don't mean to hint that you
<BR>
don't love them are only helping them out to prop up some idealized vision
<BR>
of yourself.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why more productive?  Well this one is explainable with a short analogy:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who would you rather have, 100 Bill Gateses or 100 Mother Theresas?
</EM><BR>
<P>Or 57 Frank Kafkas?
