Hello,
<BR>
<P>I write some more about this.
<BR>
<P>One key feature that would be good for the practice of democracy is the
<BR>
ability for each and every citizen to register their opinion on any vote of
<BR>
legislature, as well as to enter testimony into the public record in regards
<BR>
to any legislation.
<BR>
<P>This is quite, especially in our age of technological ability.  It would be
<BR>
an almost insignificant budget item to enable this, certainly much less than
<BR>
288 billion dollars.  Quite simply, there would be a physical address for
<BR>
each legislating body (state, federal, perhaps local) as well as an
<BR>
electronic mail address and telephone numbers.  The telephone system would
<BR>
enable any citizen to select any bill under consideration and register their
<BR>
approval or disapproval of that revision of that measure, or to do the same
<BR>
for any recently (one month, six months, more) questionned legislature,
<BR>
using the verb participle questionned in the sense of previous question or
<BR>
having been decided by vote.  By mail, any testimony in the form of print or
<BR>
handwriting on paper would be scanned to be stored exactly as the document
<BR>
represents it, as well as having optical character recognition applied that
<BR>
it be searchable, and the document images would be indexed according to
<BR>
author, issue, date, etcetera.  The same goes for e-mailed testimony, where
<BR>
the actual content e-mailed would be stored against an index of its
<BR>
contents.  As part of the public record, anyone could access any of it at
<BR>
any time.
<BR>
<P>Here, one issue is whether anonymous testimony on any issue should be
<BR>
allowed into the public record, or if only proof of citizenship is required,
<BR>
or if upon proof of citizenship identity may be discarded.
<BR>
<P>Back to popular legislation, after posting this I did some small research
<BR>
into how this is done state-by-state, and have not found a federal system
<BR>
for proposing legislation besides getting Constitutional caucuses from each
<BR>
state.  I started my clumsy research first by going a few states offficial
<BR>
web sites, which are generally accessible at <A HREF="http://www.state.xx.us/">http://www.state.xx.us/</A>, where
<BR>
xx is the two-letter state abbreviation.  Generally, under some area of the
<BR>
legislature's web site, there will be a document that is the rules of that
<BR>
legislature, and some of the ones I have read say that legislation can be
<BR>
introduced by members of the legislature, although I was browsing somewhat
<BR>
conservative states.
<BR>
<P>In terms of referendums, they are allowed by the State Constitutions in
<BR>
about half of the states.  One resource at the Ballot Initiative Strategy
<BR>
Center, perhaps a little leftist for my tastes,
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.ballot.org/resources/">http://www.ballot.org/resources/</A>, has a list of state requirements in those
<BR>
states where ballot initiative or referendum is allowed to effect policy.
<BR>
<P>In other states, those without the mechanism of popular referendum, there
<BR>
are mechanisms within each of these States' Constitutions to amend their
<BR>
rules to allow popular referendum.  How to do something like that is a
<BR>
lesson in old-school politicking.
<BR>
<P>How is a federal referendum initiated?
<BR>
<P>Back to regular popular referendums, it appears that the laws that describe
<BR>
the procedures are somewhat archaic in cases in the various states,
<BR>
requiring, for example, a certain size of printed paper (in some states,
<BR>
larger than letter or legal size paper), or having other subjectively
<BR>
pointless or interferistic procedural elements.  In at least one current
<BR>
movement for the ability to introduce some legislation to the public to vote
<BR>
upon it, the movers are using the Internet to distribute letter-sized
<BR>
affirmations by state citizens that they endorse the proposed legislation
<BR>
being presented to the people.
<BR>
<P>In the near future, the mechanism of which might be quite accessible to all
<BR>
citizens, anyone will be able to use a digital representation of their &quot;wet
<BR>
ink&quot; signature for any or all of these processes where a citizen endorsement
<BR>
is required.  Then it will be simple, instead of goig to a web site,
<BR>
printing the form, and posting it to the government to tell it to do
<BR>
something, it will be a matter of going to a website or sending an e-mail
<BR>
with the matter signed by any of a wide variety of free and commercial
<BR>
signing software.

<P><EM>&gt; What is the mechanism so that citizens may introduce legislation into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the legislature?  I am aware there are mechanisms to get public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; referendums on ballots by gathering a certain quantity of validated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signatures of citizens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess what I am finding is a flaw in our representative democracy in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the representatives aren't representative of the interests of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who elected them, for lack of any better one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In this age of modern technology, we should use some of it to enable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cyber-grassroots mobilization.  What has come to mind is a web interface
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a wwide variety of proposed legislation, a clearinghouse for it, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it were.  Say that as a U.S. citizen you can write suggested legislation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on any of a variety of topics that are legislatable.  Then, legislation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is organized so that different topics and causes will have compromises
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hammered, or separate proposals if they are incompatible.  Then, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legislation is developed in this virtual town hall federally and for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each region, separately or as one, then as legislation passes through a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public peer-review process and reaches the point where credible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; volunteers vouch for its Consitutionality and value depending on other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merits, then the legislation is fast-tracked into the requisite forms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for each jurisdiction, ie, from electronic community, communication,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussion, review, and mobilization, then the real world requirements
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for placement in the processes of legislation are fulfilled, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; virtual communities' mobilization is used locally and extra-locally to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; satisfy any requirements, where some of the first legislation might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to enable electronic satisfaction of the requirements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As electronic signatures are now as valid as written signatures, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may be used to denote citzens' affirmation of some proposeed legislation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be considered for public referendum, or even to be de facto proposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as sponsored by the locale in regular legislature.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This leads to some other issues, for example, a citizen may choose to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develop a profile of his/her views that are shared or not,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incrementally, depending upon his preferences about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This might be seen as being about reforming the government, but moreso
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is about making the government (here in the U.S.) more as it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; designed to be more than two hundred years ago, representative of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizens.
