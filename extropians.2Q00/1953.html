</EM><BR>
<P>John, has pointed out the points in my argument that I'm glossing over.
<BR>
The question is: What are the sources of mutation that lead to malignancy
<BR>
(and perhaps aspects of aging)?
<BR>
(a) Radiation
<BR>
(b) Oxidative stress
<BR>
(c) Toxins in the cellular &quot;environment&quot; (derived from food).
<BR>
(d) Mutations by DNA Polymerase in copying the DNA.
<BR>
<P>Now, look at the difference between replication in the laboratory dish
<BR>
where you are pushing the cells as fast as possible (about 1 generation
<BR>
per day) in &quot;perfect&quot; culture media, with much lower exposure to toxins
<BR>
a very uniform level of oxygen (so you can tune the antioxidant defenses
<BR>
and/or repair rates appropriately) and a much reduced level of radiation
<BR>
esposure simply due to a shorter time period.
<BR>
<P>It is well known that DNA damage &quot;cleanup&quot; is supposed to occur during
<BR>
both transcription and DNA replication.  This is however imperfect and
<BR>
certain types of damage result in repairs that must cause mutations
<BR>
(otherwise *where* would they come from?).
<BR>
<P>So, the cells are certainly exposed to lower levels of radiation and
<BR>
toxins and perhaps oxidative stress.  They are constantly replicating
<BR>
the DNA (and therefore conducting the repairs that occur during
<BR>
replication).  What we need are good data on the mutation rates
<BR>
in cell culture vs. in vivo to get any kind of a handle on this.
<BR>
Such data probably exists but I've never seen any &quot;comments&quot; on
<BR>
it vis-a-vis impact on aging and/or the development of malignancies.
<BR>
<P>To transform normal cells into malignant cells in vitro, the most
<BR>
common methods involve hitting them with a hefty dose of radiation
<BR>
or chemical mutagen.  If you just let them divide, malignant cells
<BR>
occur rarely if at all.  I seem to recall statements to the effect
<BR>
of -- you can get them if you are very patient with mouse cells
<BR>
but rarely if at all with human cells.  How much of this is due
<BR>
to differences in the in vitro vs. in vivo environment and how
<BR>
much is due to the much smaller quantity of cells in culture vs
<BR>
a living organism, I am unsure.
<BR>
<P>The simple observation that cells rarely transform in cell culture
<BR>
would seem to indicate that the majority of mutations must be coming
<BR>
from (a-c) above.   Kornberg and Baker [1] document the E. coli
<BR>
polymerase &quot;natural&quot; error rate at &lt; 10^-10 per base pair.  If
<BR>
the error rate is similar in humans (a reasonable assumption) that
<BR>
would imply 1 mutation every 3 cell divisions.  Given 90% or
<BR>
so of the DNA is junk and many mutations are &quot;silent&quot; due to
<BR>
the redundant code, you would need hundreds of cell divisisions
<BR>
before an &quot;effective&quot; mutation occured.  Most of these would have
<BR>
no effect on creating malignant cells because there only ~1% of the
<BR>
genes are involved in replication.  Hits in the ~70% of the genes
<BR>
turned off in a particular cell type will do nothing, hits
<BR>
in housekeeping genes may make the cell grow less efficiently
<BR>
(so it eventually disappears from culture due to competition),
<BR>
and hits in a few genes might result in apoptosis so it also
<BR>
disappears.
<BR>
<P>Larry Loeb (who was one of my professors) has argued fairly strongly
<BR>
that the first step in malignancy is the creation in a single cell
<BR>
of a &quot;mutator phenotype&quot;, i.e. a mutation in a gene like those
<BR>
involved in DNA repair.  The increased cancer rates found in
<BR>
Xeroderma Pigmentosum are due to mutations in the ~10 genes
<BR>
that do a specific type kind of DNA repair.  I suspect if they
<BR>
did the same type of cloning operation (creating long telomeres)
<BR>
in cows or sheep that had defects in the repair genes, that you
<BR>
would begin to see malignant cells in culture.  Or perhaps if they
<BR>
did the cell culture experiments with 50 kg of cells instead of
<BR>
milli- or micro-grams.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;that is a *far cry* from keeping alive an organism over many years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;(where background radiation plays a significant hazard).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good point but if they increased the normal background radiation by a factor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of 60 or 70 while the cells divided 93 times in vitro and they still didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get a catastrophic increase in cancer then that would eliminate that worry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think.  Anyway, it doesn't seem like a particularly difficult experiment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but to my knowledge it has not been done.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that it is interesting idea.  I suspect you could probably tease
<BR>
the information out of the existing literature on radiation, oxidative
<BR>
stress, toxin exposure, etc.  I may put this on my list as a low level
<BR>
project.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; Ever since Fossil's book, everyone has thought that &quot;aging&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; associated with telomere shortening and quite simply that is crap.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It sounds like you're saying that there is no possibility telomere shortening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has anything to do with aging, not in any way shape or form. Skepticism is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always healthy in science but cynicism is not and I don't think the evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can support such an extreme view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that Fossil attempted to make telomere shortening responsible
<BR>
for *all* aging.  First, that violates what we know about the declining
<BR>
force of natural selection with age and the Hamilton/Williams theories
<BR>
regarding pleiotropic genes (with early benefits but late harms).
<BR>
Second it makes no sense since there is lots of documentation on aging
<BR>
that occurs in the tissues of the body where cell division does not
<BR>
occur (collagen cross-linking or protein glycosylation for example).
<BR>
<P>Just so my perspective is clear, IMO, telomere shortening *does* play
<BR>
a role in aging in all dividing tissues.  So that would include:
<BR>
skin, tongue, stomach &amp; intestines, immune system, endothelial cells, and
<BR>
sometimes liver.  The diseases of the aged that result from those
<BR>
*are* dry &amp; brittle with poor healing, poor tase, poor nutrient absorption,
<BR>
increased susceptibility to pathogens, e.g. flu, stroke and liver
<BR>
cirrosis (respectively).
<BR>
<P>However, heart disease (involving immune system foam cells and/or endothelial
<BR>
cells in areas of athersclerotic plaques) and cancer (in cells that are
<BR>
programmed for or biased for division) are the two leading causes of death
<BR>
in our society.  These are diseases of *over* replication, not *under*
<BR>
replication.  It is open to debate whether making human telomeres
<BR>
&quot;shorter&quot; would have any impact on these.  Why?  Because if you make
<BR>
the telomeres shorter in endothelial cells, you might cut down
<BR>
on heart attacks from occlusions due to excessive replication in regions
<BR>
where plaques develop, but you might increase strokes due to the senscence
<BR>
of cells in high-stress arterial regions where the cells need to divide
<BR>
more frequently.  In cancer, the question is whether telomerase is
<BR>
turned on *before* or after the mutator phenotype develops?  I.e.,
<BR>
is telomerase eventually turned on because it is a required element
<BR>
of malignancy in cells with the mutator phenotype, or is telomerase
<BR>
turned on as a precursor for accumulating enough mutations to &quot;exhibit&quot;
<BR>
a mutator phenotype that eventually leads to malignancy?
<BR>
<P>So, while I will freely grant that telomeres play an important role
<BR>
in aging, they are no magic bullet.
<BR>
<P>As far as the ACT speculations go, there is no evidence I'm aware
<BR>
of that indicates that the telomeres in human adult muscle stem cells,
<BR>
neuronal stem cells, etc. are &quot;too short&quot; to grow replacement tissue.
<BR>
If you can grow a single heart from a single muscle stem cell, it
<BR>
doesn't matter if the telomeres in those 2nd generation hearts
<BR>
are too short to grow 3rd generation hearts.  Why?  Because I
<BR>
only need to harvest 10 muscle stem cells from your existing
<BR>
1st generation heart to grow enough hearts for 10 lifetimes.
<BR>
So if I am &quot;cynical&quot;, it is because West is using terms like
<BR>
&quot;breakthrough&quot;, when in fact it is something that may be entirely
<BR>
unnecessary.
<BR>
<P>If it does turn out that the telomeres are too short in your stem
<BR>
cells, doesn't it make much more sense to simply turn on telomerase
<BR>
in those stem cells (as cancer cells do) *without* resorting to
<BR>
the messy procedure of cloning your cells into denucleated oocytes
<BR>
(that at least currently would have to be harvested from human female
<BR>
volunteers)!  Now, if it turned out that you could get the magical
<BR>
telomere lengthening by putting human nuclei into mouse denucleated
<BR>
oocytes, that really would be a breakthrough!
<BR>
