One of the most popular models of what is going on during dreaming in
<BR>
my community, the memory consolidation community, is that the brain is
<BR>
doing pseudorehersal. In order to avoid catastrophic forgetting and
<BR>
transfer memories from the hippocampus to the cortex (and quite
<BR>
possibly from the basal ganglia too) the brainstem sets up random
<BR>
activity in the cortex. This activity quickly gets organised into a
<BR>
more or less random attractor state based on past memories and
<BR>
connections; it could be a past scene, but it can also be a complete
<BR>
mix between several unconnected things. These pseudomemories are then
<BR>
used to rehearse information that should be learned by the
<BR>
cortex. There are some interesting possibilities that it is the
<BR>
hippocampus working during deep sleep and the basla ganglia during REM
<BR>
sleep (we dream during both, but the deep sleep dreams are very
<BR>
fragmentary and more like thinking than experiencing/doing). Of
<BR>
course, this may not be all that is going on during sleep or the
<BR>
reason we sleep, but it is a quite good model and fits with much data.
<BR>
<P>In this case the experiences we dream are products of our inner world,
<BR>
but they are caused by random firing and not &quot;intended&quot; to have much
<BR>
meaning other than to be representative firing patterns. But since
<BR>
they contain a lot of mental material and evolve according to how our
<BR>
minds are constructed they certainly contain information about
<BR>
ourselves. I often enjoy discussing dreams with my friends, and I have
<BR>
consistently noted that people seem to have extremely different
<BR>
dreamworlds.
<BR>
<P>Are dreams the royal road to the subconscious? I doubt it. They tell a
<BR>
lot about us, but many of the references are so personal they cannot
<BR>
be interpreted by an outsider - exactly what does a cartesian product
<BR>
in a unmade bed,or the third part of the trinity playing in a jungle
<BR>
gym mean? Somehow I doubt an analyst can figure that out. Some parts
<BR>
are probably easier to interpret, and maybe some people have less
<BR>
obscure dreams, but I doubt dreams are a better insight into our minds
<BR>
than for example talking with us.

<P><EM>&gt; Regardless of how kooky his theories might have been,

<P>I agree. But the old guy is in need of being pushed down from his
<BR>
piedestal for a while. Far too many people have taken every word he
<BR>
said far too literally. After the big, noisy but necessary
<BR>
housecleaning of psychoanalysis we can put him back on his piedestal
<BR>
as revered founder again.
