<P>
<EM>&gt;That is one fact. In Europe, possession of arms is restricted. But the &quot;bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guys&quot; also have limited weapons. If you would allow anyone to carry 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;weapons,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then the bad guys will certainly carry them. Although I would have prefered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to have a gun as long as I lived in Frankfurt, I doubt that it would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;done any good. If you are unarmed, well, you can get beaten up or robbed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Okay. If you are armed, you get shot. Okay, if you are a combat-trained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gunslinger, you might be able to shoot them, but most people aren't. So 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is no big defense. The bad guys usually have more guns, more firepower and,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ost important, the least problems of using them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm, the European criminal community is very well armed. With illegal 
<BR>
weapons. Restricting guns only restrict them to the law abiding community. 
<BR>
Mugging someone in the street often doesn't require firearms, but robbing 
<BR>
banks does. Of course you have to be trained in using a firearm to use it 
<BR>
properly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Weapons do no harm. It's the people who use them. Most of the people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have guns neve use them. At least not on other people. Even most criminals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would not deliberately use excessive force to achieve their goal. If all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people have guns, the criminal is forced to use maximum force to achieve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their goal without danger for themselves. The problem of liberal gun laws 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the tendency to use them will increase.
</EM><BR>
<P>That isn't true. In Sweden we have seen a rise in crimes involving firearms 
<BR>
while the government has decreased the citizens' right to bear them (as 
<BR>
noted by criminology professor Leif G.W. Persson lately). The increase of 
<BR>
the use is from very low levels though.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If we look at the overall facts, crimes like burglary or robbery might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more frequent in Europe. But definitely the rate of murder and other 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crimes is much higher in the US. If faced with the choice, I would always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prefer Europe. Property can be restored, that's why we have insurances. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no insurance can give you back your life.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is again a bit shaky, once again compairing the US to Europe certainly 
<BR>
needs considering that different areas differ quite a lot for each other. 
<BR>
The US isn't homogenous, neither is Europe. For instance  Italy has much 
<BR>
stricter gun laws than Sweden in many ways but Sweden has a lower rate of 
<BR>
crimes involving firearms. The same example could be done for many American 
<BR>
states.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Like the Romans said: Ab igne ignem. - Out of the fire - fire.
</EM><BR>
<P>Vis pacem para bellum
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Karsten
</EM><BR>
<P>You might wonder why get into this gun debate? Well I do it for two reasons
<BR>
<P>1) It is important to understand the complex science of criminology in order 
<BR>
not to fall into the scaremongering so present today. Whatever one thinks 
<BR>
about one's country's gun laws it is important to look at the facts and do 
<BR>
intelligent analyses.
<BR>
<P>2) Gun control doesn't stop crime. One of the most complete bans on ALL 
<BR>
weapons was instituted by the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan in the 17th 
<BR>
century. It didn't stop rebellions against the shogunate (the Shimabara 
<BR>
rebellion of 1639, the peasant rebellions of the 18th century) nor the rise 
<BR>
of organized crime (the first Yakuza gumi were often formed by criminals 
<BR>
wanting more protection agianst the armed police). People made weapons for 
<BR>
themselves, for instance the nunchaku are really rice grinders. We can 
<BR>
notice that the genocide in Rwanda, where 200 000 people were brutally 
<BR>
killed was largely committed with machetes, spears, clubs and older guns.
<BR>
<P>There are certainly many more important factors behind violence in a society 
<BR>
than the availability of firearms for the law abiding citizen.
<BR>
<P>3) As much as some transhumanists wont like it, banning guns will add to a 
<BR>
restrictive pull in society, were other things might be banned as well. 
<BR>
Things that we like better than gun...
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Waldemar
