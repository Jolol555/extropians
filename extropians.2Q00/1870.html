<P><EM>&gt; In particular, I wonder if one could come up with a single buisiness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that profitably covered all aspects of transhumanism?  It'd be easy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  enough to focus on, say, just access to space, or just nanoassemblers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  or just human augmentation (though I haven't heard of too many doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that last one), but could one do them all and still turn the profit it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  would need to survive?
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the six bazillion dollar question and I spend a LOT of time thinking 
<BR>
about it.  Perhaps we'd like to see the formation of &quot;Transcendence, Inc.&quot; 
<BR>
that could attract investment and channel it into all the avenues necessary 
<BR>
to implement to broad transhumanist agenda, from efforts toward cultural 
<BR>
change through basic scientific research through technical applications and 
<BR>
the creation of products and services.  But the time just isn't ripe yet, 
<BR>
IMO.  Trying this now would be like trying to start Boeing or Lockheed in 
<BR>
1850.
<BR>
<P>What I do see happening in the very near future is larger and larger &quot;chunks&quot; 
<BR>
of the transhumanist agenda coming together into viable businesses.  With 
<BR>
practical wearables just around the corner and the developing bandwidth 
<BR>
explosion, I see the formation of &quot;personal information ecology&quot; companies 
<BR>
within the next five years or so.  Attempts are already being made to bring 
<BR>
all of the various strands of the biomedical work in anti-aging together into 
<BR>
the formation of clinics and medical practices that focus on this work in an 
<BR>
integrated manner.  We already have a couple of companies focused 
<BR>
specifically on developing nanotech.  Success by any of the completely 
<BR>
private launch companies could spur the formation of vertically-integrated 
<BR>
space access and service companies.  Success in founding a cryonics-oriented 
<BR>
community could become the seed of a transhumanist enclave.
<BR>
<P>As these precursor businesses succeed over the next ten years, the groundwork 
<BR>
will be laid for even more integrated &quot;transhumanist goods and services&quot; 
<BR>
enterprises.  When will this happen?  It seems to me unlikely before 2010.  
<BR>
It seems hard to imagine it wouldn't occur before 2040.  In the broad sweep 
<BR>
of human history, that's the blink of an eye.
