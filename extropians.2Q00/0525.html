<P>I'm not sure where, but you might check the FBI's web site.  They do most of
<BR>
the national reporting on crime statistics in the US.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Would not most humans, both those living in, and those visiting the United
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; States, wish to see the information, preferably in the form of a map, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more detailed the better, so they who prefer to avoid death and mutilation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can avoid the dangerous places where, apparently, the Bad Guys, Inc., kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans with impunity?
</EM><BR>
<P>Problem might be, e.g., some of the safest places are sleepy suburban
<BR>
communities with no tourist attractions.  I recall several years ago the
<BR>
alleged safest place in New York State was some little village way up north
<BR>
where it was pretty cold most of the year.  In fact, it was one of the
<BR>
snowiest places in NY State, which might account for the low crime rate.
<BR>
(That said, when I used to live in a very high crime neighborhood and worked
<BR>
nights, I always felt safer when it was raining, cold, or snowing.  Less
<BR>
people were out and I felt my chances are being harassed were lower.
<BR>
Certainly, the few times anyone did bother me were when those conditions did
<BR>
not hold, so there might be a causal relation here.:)
<BR>
<P>Also, I imagine those places are not the job havens the big cities are.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Has anybody produced such a map already?  If not, why not?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems there would exist a large market for such detailed maps.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure, though what does happen frequently in the US is there's
<BR>
mention in the major Media outlets of the safest cities and the most
<BR>
dangerous ones.  Also, there's a mention of the best places to live in the
<BR>
US as measured along several parameters, including crime rates.  (But also
<BR>
including cost of living, taxes, etc.)
