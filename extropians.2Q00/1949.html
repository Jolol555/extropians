&quot;The fact that a dangerous real estate bubble runs simultaneously makes

this both an extraordinary period and one unfortunately quite vulnerable to a

<BR>
<P>Doug Noland has done some interesting analysis on money/cedit/debt creation
<BR>
by GSE's. 
<BR>
<P>My central thesis is that an unwinding in any of these highly leveraged
<BR>
positions (e.g. stocks, real estate, hedge funds, and above all banking- 
<BR>
particularly gold banking) will cascade into the others. 
<BR>
<P>Example 1.: A person uses a 125% ditech re-fi to invest in stocks, pulling out 
<BR>
profits to pay the mortgage. Stocks go down, mortgage payments missed, bank 
<BR>
is short on reserves, has to unwind some of its leveraged positions, such 
<BR>
as OTC currency hedges and stocks. Multiply by 10 million Joe Sixpacks.
<BR>
<P>Example 2.: The systemic risk to the global financial system *may* now be
<BR>
great enough that a single actor can cause widespread collapse, similar
<BR>
to Nobel Prize-winning LTCM- the &quot;house of cards&quot; argument. Say Soros cuts 
<BR>
a deal with the Chinese to supply several hundred tons of gold at price 
<BR>
(spot + X). China sell its US T-bonds to finance. Connect dots.
<BR>
<P>Here in Seattle we are seeing signs of financial stress- people I know or know 
<BR>
of that have lost *large* amounts in the stock market and a whole lot of
<BR>
stiff upper lips- call it a mood index.
<BR>
<P>Prediction: Seattle will lead the nation on the downside.

<P><EM>&gt; consumer and corporate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;debt loads, current account deficit, real estate inflation, surreal

<EM>&gt;government statistics, fraudulent accounting practices in technology

<EM>&gt;firms like Lucent, Intel, IBM, Microsoft, etc., gold banking implosion-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in-the-making, 
</EM><BR>
<P>See for example:

<BR>
This is the nastiest one. It can lead to a fundamental shift in the 
<BR>
monetary order. To the *rest* of the world, gold is money.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;bank derivatives exposures (ala LTCM writ large), and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so forth ad nauseum make the crash/depression of 1929-1939 look like a speed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bump.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I couldn't disagree more. The strictness of accounting standards is much 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tougher now than then. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Some significant amount (I don't have figures in front of me for this) of 
<BR>
corporate earnings in the past few years has come from playing in the stock
<BR>
market,
<BR>
with other companies stocks. This works great on the upside (everyone is a 
<BR>
genius in a bull market)- but yields nasty fire-sale de-leveraging on the
<BR>
downside.
<BR>
<P>Prediction: Many prominent companies will have horrific 2nd quarter earnings.
<BR>
<P>Also, please note the rash of companies forced to restate earnings- almost 
<BR>
always to the downside, often after the prior earnings report has &quot;increased
<BR>
shareholder value&quot;, i.e. jacked the stock price.
<BR>
<P>Example:
<BR>
========
<BR>
But what happens to Dell if its stock doesn't continue to go up and
<BR>
up? The liabilities could be huge—say $3.1 billion in the other direction.
<BR>
Is any of this illegal? Apparently not. Only professional athletes can't bet
<BR>
on their own team to win. But the game of playing puts and calls, and
<BR>
the inflated bottom lines that result, is just another example of the death
<BR>
of good old reliable earnings reports.

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There are problems, but they are problems that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably understate* the value of companies. For instance, more and more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;value is in the form of hard to measure intangibles. There's a lot of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;literature on this that I could suggest. (Do a search for Baruch Lev for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;starters. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The future is also hard to measure, I therefore have to assign a value 
<BR>
of *zero* to intangible assets such as goodwill, branding, IP, earnings 
<BR>
trends and so forth.

The Case for a Major Market Meltdown

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;After analyzing 100 years of data, two authors say the chances for it are high

<PRE>

  very high 
<P>  A slash in the value of U.S. stocks by 50% -- or more -- isn't just a scary
  possibility, it's an economic likelihood. That's the startling contention of
Andrew
  Smithers and Stephen Wright, authors of a new book, Valuing Wall Street:
  Protecting Wealth in Turbulent Markets. Smithers, chairman of a
  London-based economic consulting firm, and Wright, of Cambridge University,
  think there's a 67% chance of such a crash in the coming year.

=========
<P>&gt;What is this about consumer debt loads?
<P>The US household savings rate is well into negative territory for the first 
time since the Great Depression. Average home equity has been *decreasing* 
in spite of real estate price inflation! 2/3 of US GDP is created by consumer 
spending, funded by an increasing debt load. This cannot continue forever.
The bond yield curve inversion is apparently signaling that the party is over.
<P>Add to this the record corporate debt (as % GDP)- which is used to fuel earnings
via the stock market!
A nice Austrian School viewpoint:
<P>=========
To cite from a contemporary report by the League of Nations about this
development: &quot;The credit expansion after 1927 in the United States went
largely to the financing of speculation. According to available statistics, no
less than 86% of the total increase in bank credit was used for that purpose.
Thus was laid the foundation for the stock-exchange boom which followed.&quot;

=========
<P>&gt; You mean the $21 billion 
&gt;dollars in cash held by MSFT, or the huge amounts at other companies?
&gt; Today 
&gt;is also unlike 1929 in that Greenspan would never let the money supply fall 
&gt;by a third as the Fed did back then, turning a stock market crash into an 
&gt;economic depression.
<P>This time we are not using money.
If we run short of chits due to a recession, or stock market blow-off,
or liquidity crisis, or banking crisis, or currency devaluation, or accelerating 
inflation, foreign debt holders (our creditors) will be happy to supply us 
with all the dollars we can eat. Remember, a Federal Reserve Note is ultimately 
an IOU. We (the US) owe them (the world) somewhere around $2 trillon (and 
accelerating) worth of &quot;stuff&quot;. Here we refer to the 1970's, when offshore 
dollars (Japan, oil producers) were repatriated in fear of hyperinflation.
<P>Prediction: Large US$ currency exchange rate swings dead ahead.
<P>&gt;&gt;I find it rather simple. If a company loses money consistently (amazon.com,
&gt;&gt;biotech.com), cooks the books (Lucent, Microstrategy, etc.), has a P/E
&gt;&gt;in the hundreds or thousands (Yahoo!, Cisco, MSFT, etc.)- meaning it
&gt;&gt;will require hundreds or thousands of years to pay for itself, then
&gt;&gt;that company is grotesquely overvalued.
<P>&gt;Forrest, at least get your numbers straight. MSFT's P/E (*before* today's 
&gt;17% haircut) was a mere 47. And remember, that's without backing out $21 
&gt;billion in cash holdings (Not to mention a similar amount in unrealized 
investment gains.) 
<P>A mere 47. So it only has to blow off another 60-70% or so to revert to the
mean.
The index P/E at the 1929 blow off top rose to a then unheard of 16.2.
Nasdaq's is cruising around flight level 200, even after the April death 
march. If Mr.Parish is correct, then Microsoft's P/E is indeed, in the 
hundreds, *still*. I'm not a CPA, apparently he is.
<P><A HREF="http://billparish.com/msftfraudfacts.html">http://billparish.com/msftfraudfacts.html</A>
<P>Prediction: Microsoft no longer has anywhere near $21 billion cash 
reserves- several billion were vaporized covering its calls.
<P>&gt;Yes, Cisco is pretty expensive, but it's also positioned 
&gt;at the center of the New Economy and continues to grow rapidly. Looking at 
&gt;very high P/Es of a Yahoo in isolation is meaningless. It's forward P/Es 
&gt;and PEG ratios that matter. If a young company has just made a small profit 
&gt;but is growing rapidly, an astronomical PE can fall very fast looking ahead.
<P>The &quot;New Economy&quot; slogan was coined in the '20's, and was much the same theory.
Trend earnings assume that the rest of the economy will keep performing as it 
did *in the recent past*, and that the business cycle has been repealed.
<P>&gt;I disagree with most of the rest of your post, but that's all I'm going to 
&gt;comment on for now. This thread would probably be best suited to the 
&gt;Investing in the Future forum.
<P>The topic is not whether to buy into the latest no-earnings.com, but what
is happening to the economies of the entire world, and what may occur. In my
opinion this belongs on page 1. I urge you to at least give this some of
your consideration.
<P>Forrest
