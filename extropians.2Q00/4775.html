Title
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brain glutathione
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reductase induction increases early
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;survival and decreases lipofuscin accumulation in aging frogs.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brain catalase was continuously depleted throughout the life
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;span starting with a large population of initially young and old frogs. Free
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;radical-related parameters were measured in the brain tissue
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;once per year after 2.5, 14.5, and 26.5 months of experimentation.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brain lipofuscin accumulation was observed after 14.5 and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;26.5 months, and survival was continuously followed during 33 months. The age
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the animal did not decrease endogenous antioxidants nor increase tissue
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;peroxidation either in cross-sectional or longitudinal comparisons.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous catalase depletion similarly affected young and old animals,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inducing glutathione reductase, tending to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;decrease oxidized glutathione/reduced
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;glutathione (GSSG/GSH) ratio, decreasing lipofuscin
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;accumulation in the brain, and increasing survival from 46%
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to 91% after 14.5 months. At 26.5 months of experimentation the loss of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;glutathione reductase
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;induction in catalase-depleted animals was accompanied by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the presence of higher lipofuscin deposits than in controls and was followed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by a great increase in mortality rate. Even though the maximal life span (7
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;years) was the same in the control and treated animals which were already old
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(4.2 years) at the beginning of the experiment, the treated animals showed a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;strong reduction in the rates of early death. It is proposed that the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;maintenance of a high antioxidant/prooxidant balance in the vertebrate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;brain greatly increases the probability of the individual to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reach the final segments of its species-specific life span.
