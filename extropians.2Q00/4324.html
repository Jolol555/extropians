<EM>&gt;Actually the fundie line is that that was a different &quot;dispensation&quot;.  Since 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the death and resurrection of Christ, we are now in the dispensation of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;grace&quot; and those old rules that are *really* hard to live by don't really 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;count anymore.  Granted there is nothing in the text of the scripture which 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sanctions this, but come on we can't go around stoning our kids for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;insubordination in this day and age, now can we?
</EM><BR>
<P>No need to, they may well be out &quot;stoning&quot; themselves as we read.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundies would seem to me to be a valid argument, only in the fact that what the Big J.C. presents to the people is a new covenant, or contract, and that would at least imply that the old contract was null and void. Though that only really matters if you view the bible as something more than stories to frighten the kids with.
