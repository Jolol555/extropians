<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; For the record, I am not anxiously looking forward to *that* level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; surveillance.  It may or may not become ubiquitous.  But if it does, me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; thinks the best defense will be to live a life that you would not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ashamed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to have broadcast to the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Ah, the call for uniformity and conformance to 'accepted' society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not at all.  If it is a call to anything, it is a call to integrity, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; living the same life in private as you live in public.  This is certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not a call to conformance to anything except your own professed world view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is not even (necessarily) a call to legality.  If you are opposed to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law of the land, you are free to engage in civil disobedience, so long as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (like the civil rights activists of the '60's) you are willing to &quot;lay it on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the line&quot; for your convictions.  But, on the other hand, if you want to wear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the mask of Johnny Civic-Law-Abiding-Citizen in public and yet do whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deviant thing you want in private, you need to vote a vociferous &quot;no&quot; for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transparency.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is absolutely nothing inconsistent with being a perfectly law abiding
<BR>
citizen and maintaining a private life. There are many personal habits which are
<BR>
quite legal but which are really nobody's business to know. Would you like the
<BR>
world to know that you pick your nose and eat it? That you scratch your ass and
<BR>
smell your fingers?  How would you like the world to call you Booger for the
<BR>
rest of your life? How quickly will you stop doing that thing you find so
<BR>
enjoyable then? Still think ubiquitous surveillance won't cause conformity? How
<BR>
would you like the world to be able to weigh in on what they think about the way
<BR>
you raise your kids? How would you like everyone your kids grows up with to know
<BR>
that they wet the bed? How many pedophiles are going to stalk your kids by
<BR>
spying on them with a waspcam? You can't reply &quot;we'll catch them, and that will
<BR>
deter them from doing so&quot;. That is an incredibly stupid and naive reply, because
<BR>
if you know anything about such people it is that they don't care about getting
<BR>
caught, they just HAVE to satisfy their urges.
