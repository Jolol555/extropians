<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  Mike, this is about the closest thing to an actual death-threat as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  have ever witnessed on this list.  Even if you don't really mean it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  you must have suspected that this would bother some people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So how would this be any different from threating someone with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;'killfiling'??? I suppose you are going to say threatening that too is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;death threat...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You told Brian that he should be glad that dueling was illegal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because he would be dead by now.  
</EM><BR>
<P>That was a reflection on how I imagined Max probably felt at the moment,
<BR>
and seeing how Brian seemed, at the time to me, to be blithely ignorant
<BR>
of this. I would hope others on the list would have merely associated
<BR>
this comment with past comments of mine about how much more polite
<BR>
society was when dueling of various sorts, was an accepted and legal
<BR>
means of redress. Note that I said &quot;IF&quot;. Since such forms of redress are
<BR>
now quite obviously illegal, my comment was merely a reflection to
<BR>
another time, nothing more.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When someone suggested a committee
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to deal with Brian and his like, you suggested that you tended to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shoot first and swear in the body later.  Then you reference the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; above quote in the same thread and act surprised that anybody might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interpret it  as referring to real killing?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am quite surprised that you would leap to such a drastic assumption,
<BR>
and would not see the sarcasm and self deprecation in the comment. I am
<BR>
pretty amazed at your utter inability to comprehend the sarcastic humor
<BR>
in the exaggeration.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are too intelligent to feign that level of ignorance.
</EM><BR>
<P>Feign what level of ignorance?
<BR>
