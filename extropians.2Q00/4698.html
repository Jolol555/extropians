<EM>&gt; Those numbers sound about right for the US market.  It's worth noting though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that basing your strategy solely on US returns neglects survivorship bias.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It would have been hard in 1920 to know that the US economy would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survived the major disruptive events of the last century largely unscathed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (in contrast to Germany, Poland, Argentina etc).

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you try to adjust for this, the historical equity premium looks much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lower - see &quot;A Century of Global Stock Markets&quot;, a WP by Goetzmann and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jorion or the review article at:

<P>I think though that a preference for a stable long term market, like that of the
<BR>
US, helps attract the capital that feeds its higher average growth. Reading the
<BR>
article I'd also note that the worst performing countries are those that
<BR>
practice widespread socialism or other political tyranny. Apparently Rouwenhorst
<BR>
agrees, seeing as how he has divvied up the time lines of some countries between
<BR>
socialist/tyrannical phases, and relatively freer eco-political phases. This all
<BR>
follows the adages of 'success is its own reward', 'doing well by doing good',
<BR>
that sort of thing. People want to put their money where it is safe, and that
<BR>
preference can feed its own growth.
<BR>
<P>I think one of the reasons why todays stock market has seen so much growth and
<BR>
volatility is that most of the generation of people who lived through the market
<BR>
crash in 1929 are now dead, so there are fewer risk averse people in the market
<BR>
than previously. My 88 year old grandmother was a teen ager then, and has been
<BR>
so financially paranoid that until recently she kept all her money in bonds and
<BR>
CDs.
