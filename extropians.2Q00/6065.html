<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
I'm violating my stated intent to remain silent for a few days,
<BR>
because of the seeming absurdity of your post, Max.
<BR>
<P>Consider:
<BR>
<P>1. Someone (who happens to be the woman you love, yes) engages
<BR>
in petty name-calling against me, suggests I'm inauthentic (or
<BR>
at least a failure) in my desire to move towards the Good, and
<BR>
generally manifests intellectual laziness and/or thoughtlessness
<BR>
(if not malevolence) when responding to my attempts to work
<BR>
through an extremely subtle problem.
<BR>
<P>2. I react strongly.
<BR>
<P>3. You Max, insult me yet again, and declare that I'm not worth
<BR>
responding to.
<BR>
<P>Astonishing!
<BR>
<P>I'd be less sure of my interpretations if I hadn't checked them
<BR>
with several people before sending my last few emails. (All
<BR>
agree the unqualified nature of my original claim was wrong, but
<BR>
all also agree that little or nothing else was.)
<BR>
<P>I'm disappointed, but would never claim anything like this:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; means that I will no longer attempt to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engage in any communication with Delaney.
</EM><BR>
<P>I remain open to communication, though I think the odds of its
<BR>
success seem low, especially after this recent vicious,
<BR>
one-sided post of yours.
<BR>
<P>It's now difficult for me to see you as wanting to broker a
<BR>
peace, as opposed to something else (I don't know what).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am utterly disgusted at Delaney's last, most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vicious attack on Natasha.
</EM><BR>
<P>And apparently NOT by her treatment of me. Surely you can
<BR>
understand the temptation to call this &quot;intellectual/political
<BR>
tribalism&quot; (or, _perhaps_ simply: &quot;love&quot; -- also a kind of
<BR>
tribalism, though understandable).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I can deal with his tactics when used against me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I draw the line when he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; draws Natasha in then opens fire with all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guns blazing, [...]
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;All guns blazing&quot;? Hardly. She insulted me, I insulted her
<BR>
back. one plus negative one = zero. Why react so harshly to
<BR>
zero?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [...] all the while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; posturing as Mr. Charitable and Mr. Reasonable.
</EM><BR>
<P>I certainly no longer have any great desire to be charitable,
<BR>
though that desire can return.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am also disgusted that Delaney uses the shameful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tactic of describing people as a &quot;cult&quot; because a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couple of people out of hundreds dared draw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his fire by standing up for me.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not precisely disgusted (at this point I've barfed what
<BR>
remained of the contents of my gut), but again disappointed that
<BR>
you've demoted a contentful claim, one suggesting a motivation
<BR>
for the irrational one-sided interpretation of my comments, to a
<BR>
&quot;tactic.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The problem -- at least one -- seems to be that you think
<BR>
there's nothing wrong with being stupid or lazy or tribal
<BR>
(PLEASE don't miss the &quot;or&quot; -- by the way, I assume it's mostly
<BR>
the third in the case of Natasha, though I don't kjnow her well
<BR>
enough to be certain -- note, further, I'm not 100% certain
<BR>
there isn't some other explanation), and/or -- this is more
<BR>
likely -- that you think the degree of her misreading of my
<BR>
posts was low enough that I didn't need to mobilize any such
<BR>
hypotheses. Given that I claimed (with some evidence) that the
<BR>
degree was indeed high, why not engage me on that very point:
<BR>
&quot;Brian, you're attributing ill-will to Natasha because you think
<BR>
she's willfully misreading your posts? I disagree. Here's why:
<BR>
1. When she criticizes you for attributing some sort of
<BR>
childishness to her or her choice of lovers because of the word
<BR>
choice, 'boyfriend,' you have to understand that our community
<BR>
in LA uses the term 'man-friend' for male adult lovers.... 2.
<BR>
....&quot; (etc. -- just an example)
<BR>
<P>But that's NOT what you did. Rather than take that approach, you
<BR>
decided simply to ATTACK.
<BR>
<P>That by itself isn't so bad (I've done the same thing -- it can
<BR>
be seen as another way of engaging in the very question of
<BR>
correct interpretation). BUT, after attacking, you're calling it
<BR>
quits. That is obviously NOT engagement at all, but a desire to
<BR>
strike and run, like the kids who place a burning bag of shit on
<BR>
someone's doorstep and run away, not far enough so that they
<BR>
miss watching the person stomp on it, but far enough away so
<BR>
they don't have to deal with the consequences.
<BR>
<P>Now THAT sort of behavior is disgusting, and, in my view, wrong
<BR>
in the extreme.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I thought we were making some progress,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; publicly and privately.
</EM><BR>
<P>We were, and could still -- but if you want to give up, I
<BR>
certainly can't stop you, though, in all frankness, my opinion
<BR>
of you will head south and probably stay south (yeah, yeah, I
<BR>
know, same thing for me in your mind -- I'm leaving myself wide
<BR>
open here).
<BR>
<P>Bear in mind Max -- I've said this before -- there are different
<BR>
sub-cultures even within the U.S., with very different norms of
<BR>
right conduct.
<BR>
<P>(I ask you again to consider the form/content distinction, the
<BR>
part of any possible sub-cultural difference that is probably
<BR>
most relevant here -- I read Plato and Hegel!)
<BR>
<P>I will happily apologize for something I know to be wrong. I
<BR>
apologized for the lack of qualifications to my anti-Semitism
<BR>
point, and will again, if needed. Anything else I've been
<BR>
accused of doing wrong seems to me -- as I've so far seen it --
<BR>
like nothing but my unwillingness to turn the other cheek, and
<BR>
my belief that firing back is often the best approach (the
<BR>
jury's still out on this, by the way) when I'm treated badly. If
<BR>
I were a Christian this never would have happened. I think I'll
<BR>
go read some Nietzsche and mourn the &quot;death of God.&quot; (By the
<BR>
way, I think this exchange might provide some evidence that
<BR>
Nietzsche was right in using the scare-quotes. Note I certainly
<BR>
wouldn't claim that in my world, God is completely gone.)
<BR>
<P><P>I've stomped on your bag of shit. Enjoy the view, and the
<BR>
comforts of disengagement.
<BR>
<P>Towards the Good (a smelly Good, at the moment!),
<BR>
Brian
