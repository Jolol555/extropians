I once here cited analysis by Robert Shiller that suggested
<BR>
the current stock market was in a bubble.  However, I just came
<BR>
across relevant analysis by J. Bradford Delong, who I have other
<BR>
reasons for respecting.  He finds that long term fluctuations
<BR>
are probably rational, while short term ones can be irrational.

<P>Abstract
<BR>
<P>Major long-run swings in the U. S. stock market over the past century are
<BR>
broadly consistent with a model driven by changes in current and expected
<BR>
future dividends in which investors must estimate the time-varying long-run
<BR>
dividend growth rate. Such an estimated long-run growth rate resembles a
<BR>
long distributed lag on past dividend growth, and is highly correlated with
<BR>
the level of dividends. Prices therefore respond more than proportionately
<BR>
to long-run movements in dividends. The time-varying component of dividend
<BR>
growth need not be detectable in the dividend data for it to have large
<BR>
effects on stock prices

<P>&quot;The Stock Market Bubble of 1929: Evidence from Closed-end Mutual Funds&quot;

<BR>
<P>Abstract
<BR>
<P>Economists directly observe warranted &quot;fundamental&quot; values in only a few
<BR>
cases. One is that of closed-end mutual funds: their fundamental value is
<BR>
simply the current market value of the securities that make up their
<BR>
portfolios. We use the difference between prices and net asset values of
<BR>
closed-end mutual funds at the end of the 1920s to estimate the degree to
<BR>
which the stock market was overvalued on the eve of the 1929 crash. We
<BR>
conclude that the stocks making up the S &amp; P composite were priced at least
<BR>
30 percent above fundamentals in late summer, 1929.
