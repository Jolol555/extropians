<EM>&gt; &gt; Sounds like Mike Lorrey is going to need a *much* bigger gun :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh, an F-16 is pretty easy to hit at 3000 feet, thats only 1000 yards. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already have a rifle that could hit that target. What I need is a bigger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; warhead...
</EM><BR>
<P>Besides, all I really need is some good jamming equipment, and maybe a laser
<BR>
dazzler.
<BR>
<P>However, given knowledge of speed and altitude, its not hard to hit an aircraft
<BR>
given practice, with a firearm. When I was in the Air Force, repairing bullet
<BR>
damage from cattle ranchers in the western US was one of the big sheetmetal jobs
<BR>
that the airframe troops had to deal with.
<BR>
<P>FOr example: An F-16 is, as I recall, 47 feet long, or .0089 miles long. At 550
<BR>
mph, it is traveling 806.6667 feet per second. A 150 grain bullet fired from my
<BR>
bolt action .300 Win Mag Savage 110 Tactical rifle travels at about 3000 feet
<BR>
per second. Assuming that it is a crossing shot, rather than a head on or tail
<BR>
on shot (which are much easier), and assuming I want to hit the F-16 when it is
<BR>
at a point tangential to me (i.e. the closest point in its path), I need to aim
<BR>
roughly 16 plane lengths ahead of the craft, or else drift my sighting system so
<BR>
the point of aim is that many plane lengths behind the point of fire. Getting it
<BR>
precisely would require some more figuring, but all such results can be
<BR>
tabletized, and were so by the NVA during Vietnam. There were a good number of
<BR>
aircraft shot down by small arms fire.
<BR>
<P>Now, using leading techniques is not widely used with rifles, that is usually
<BR>
used by shotgunners, but there have been some people who have taken the time and
<BR>
are quite skilled at shooting flying objects with rifles. I recall that the
<BR>
original Army test for the Browning Automatic Rifle (the BAR) back when involved
<BR>
John Moses Browning hiring one man who was an exceptional sharpshooter. This
<BR>
gentleman shot something like 75,000 1 inch blocks of wood out of the air
<BR>
(typically thrown 50-100 feet in the air) straight over a period of several days
<BR>
with that BAR (which is a really heavy gun with a serious kick to it). I think
<BR>
he might have had something like a dozen misses or less in the entire string of
<BR>
shots. The shooter claimed that he could teach anybody to shoot like that.
