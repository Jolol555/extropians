<P><EM>&gt; I wonder why folks (not only here) pay so much attention to defining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and critiquing art?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  My (admittedly uneducated-in-formal-art-matters) perspective about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  art is that:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  * someone's art has value if they succeed in creating a concrete
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  manifestation of something that &quot;moves&quot; them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  * that person's art has an even higher value if that other person's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  art succeeds in moving _me_
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, Amara
<BR>
<P>First of all,  fun to talk about art forms!  It inspires, intrigues and 
<BR>
delights!
<BR>
It's useful to take as much of it away with you as you can! It is intersting. 
<BR>
What makes somethign of value to you, specifically? Talking about it shares 
<BR>
it with the others who percieve it, and perhpas they percieve it quite 
<BR>
differently and you can shed some light on it!!! Especially if you are 
<BR>
knowledgeable about it's origins, or it's genre or performers...
<BR>
<P>I agree with you that for the purposes of creating one's own art it is not 
<BR>
useful to critique it as you go... that would be horribly stifling! But once 
<BR>
it's finished, it's good to look back objectively and see what's what!!
<BR>
<P>On a larger scale: 
<BR>
Setting certain standards for art, films, etc., is a tough thing, since so 
<BR>
much is open for debate, but it is a useful thing!! : )  
<BR>
<P>It gives us a wider plateau from which to view upcoming art forms. It gives 
<BR>
us terms and symbols and guides. Simply saying it's crappy may hold truth for 
<BR>
you, but it doesn't let anyone else know what elements you found unlikeable, 
<BR>
or even if you *found* it unlikeable. I like LOTs of crappy things, myself ; 
<BR>
) Like Bruce Willis films!
<BR>
<P>To be able to break down a piece of music, for example, and say what parts 
<BR>
were harmonious, which ones were out of time,  who the bassist was, which 
<BR>
melodies were derivative of something else...  it helps others to know where 
<BR>
things are going, and what to listen for.. it's communication about some of 
<BR>
the most beautiful things we can encounter in our lives... 
<BR>
...honestly ...if you love music ...it's fun!
