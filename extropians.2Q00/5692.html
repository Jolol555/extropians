</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My &quot;place in society&quot;? Doesn't exist for me. I could walk into any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place and act like a completely different person, and no one would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know that it wasn't me, and there would be absolutely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no repercussions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you think your personality has changed more during the 2 years you've
<BR>
been in Germany than it would have changed if you'd stayed in the US?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;It's a (very) bizarre kind of freedom.
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you tried out many different personas?
<BR>
<P>Occassionally I get an urge to go someplace entirely different and start a
<BR>
whole new life. It's a totally fanciful urge that would involve sneaking
<BR>
onto a moving freight train or hitch hiking, leaving all my possessions
<BR>
behind, changing my name. I've heard that in certain parts of India the men
<BR>
used to leave their homes after their children were grown, and spend some
<BR>
time wandering around the country with only the clothes they had on and a
<BR>
bowl.  The bowl would be filled by kind strangers. Or not filled sometimes,
<BR>
I guess.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;The closest I've ever come to the train-hopping fantasy is moving to
<BR>
Chicago and living in a downtown apartment only a couple of blocks from the
<BR>
office building where I worked. Not nearly so drastic as what you're doing,
<BR>
Amara, but I was with a whole different group of people and living a far
<BR>
different lifestyle than I was used to. After a while, I found myself
<BR>
thinking of moving to the suburbs where I could have a dog and a garden.  I
<BR>
have no doubt that's exactly what I would have done if I hadn't decided that
<BR>
the winters were too cold in Chicago. So I would have been right back in the
<BR>
lifestyle I'd left behind. A cousin of mine (my cousin Lizzie's sister,
<BR>
actually) moved to the small town near my home after spending 14 years in
<BR>
Manhatten. That's been a bit of a cultural shock for her.  No decent
<BR>
restaurants within walking distance, for one thing.
<BR>
<P>Once or twice I've tried participating on internet lists with a sex-neutral
<BR>
name to see if I could be a completely *neutral* person.  But I found it
<BR>
really difficult to express myself without my personality creeping into the
<BR>
messages.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;It's even
<BR>
<EM>&gt; more bizarre operating at about a language understanding of 50%,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like living every day as a partial deaf-mute.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I have some idea of how that would be.  The thing I miss the most when
<BR>
I'm using a language in which I'm not fluent is being able to have a REAL
<BR>
conversation; it's especially bad not knowing the slang and not
<BR>
understanding the humor. Of course, my attempts at speaking often provide
<BR>
all the humor one could want. (I just had a vision flash through my mind of
<BR>
the Monty Python skit where this guy has a German-to-English phrase book and
<BR>
is trying to ask directions to some place in London from a rather large
<BR>
woman. He reads from the book, &quot;You have lovely breasts, Madame.&quot;  She
<BR>
whacks him with her wallet, as he stares at her with a totally bewildered
<BR>
expression)
<BR>
<P>When I'm in a country where I'm not too good at the language I often seek
<BR>
out very old people.  They tend to have the patience to speak slowly and
<BR>
draw out of me the words I'm searching for. Old ladies sitting on church
<BR>
steps begging for money are especially wonderful people.  I always look for
<BR>
them, and oddly enough they always accept me without question and let me sit
<BR>
and talk to them, as though God has sent me to entertain them. When I get up
<BR>
to leave after hanging out for an hour or so, they usually say their
<BR>
language's form of &quot;God bless you,&quot; and I do feel truly blessed, but by the
<BR>
old ladies themselves.
<BR>
<P><P><EM> &gt; My two best friends currently are a Greek and a German. I'm surrounded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with Germans (mostly), and then Italians, Austrailians, French, British,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mexicans, Hungarians. My office-mate is Russian. There has been noone of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my culture around me during the last 2 years. Sometimes it's hard to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find my equilibrium being among so many unfamiliar cultures for so long.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But people over history have done this during war times. And it could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more difficult. My father left his home country forever during WWII.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now I find that completely daunting.
</EM><BR>
<P>I like to hear the life stories of people like your father.  For some
<BR>
reason, I feel hopeful and uplifted by the lives of those people.  Maybe
<BR>
because their stories are a reminder that there are always options, and also
<BR>
because they inspire courage.
<BR>
