<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Surveillance has *nothing* to do with freedom.  You are free now to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; anything that is legal.  You would have that exact same freedom in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; completely transparent society.  Your only loss of freedom would be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; freedom to commit a crime and get away with it.  If you have a problem 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; giving that up, I think that says more about you than it says about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Yes.  It says that my ideas of morality are not identical to those of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;current lawmakers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Morality is not the issue.  Legality is.  They are not synonyms.
</EM><BR>
<P>That appears (to me) to be exactly what I said.  The lack of synonymity
<BR>
*is* the issue.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;	My current life partner is of the same gender as I am.  Sometimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;we hold hands when we are walking down the street.  Sometimes, when no one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;else is around, I even kiss her.  In many places, this is still listed as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a crime.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not saying every law on the books is a good law.  What I am saying is, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if the law is bad, don't break it, work to get it changed (unless like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Martin Luther King you are breaking the law with an agenda).
</EM><BR>
<P>I do work to change laws of which I disapprove.
<BR>
<P>I presume, from your statements below, that you are not actually
<BR>
suggesting I avoid my partner until such time as a few ridiculous laws are
<BR>
taken off the books.  I didn't actually mean to make this particular
<BR>
aspect of my life into an issue--I was simply giving one example out of
<BR>
many ways in which perfectly moral actions can get one into trouble in a
<BR>
country where the government is permitted to watch and record public
<BR>
space.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But then for every rule there *is* an exception.  Although I am married and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heterosexual, I am vehemently opposed to laws that proscribe the sexual 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behavior of consenting adults.  The laws against consensual homosexual acts 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are downright wrong (IMO) and do not carry the moral authority to compel 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obedience to them.  The *only* good thing about such laws is the infrequency 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of their enforcement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I see such laws as being analogous to the 19th Century Supreme Court 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decision that &quot;no black man has any rights which any white man is obliged to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respect.&quot;  I know that *some people* on this list will now take this as an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opportunity to show what a hypocrite I am.  &quot;You say, don't break the law, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but its OK to violate laws against sodomy?&quot;  All I can say is, for every 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rule there is an exception.  For me, sodomy is one of the few exceptions.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Again, even though it is *not* a law that *I* have any personal desire to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violate.  But for those who do, they can have at it with my blessing.)
</EM><BR>
<P>There is nothing to cause the government to differentiate the exceptions
<BR>
(and they are different for everybody) from the 'norm.'  There is no place
<BR>
on the books where laws are marked as either having or lacking 'moral
<BR>
authority.'  Last year a guy in Michigan got prosecuted for violating a
<BR>
law forbidding use of profanity in front of women and children (he fell
<BR>
out of a boat into cold water and reacted verbally.  Unfortunately another
<BR>
boat nearby happened to contain a woman with children who remembered and
<BR>
approved of the statute).  Since the government does not make this same
<BR>
distinction that you do, our only protection is that they cannot keep a
<BR>
constant eye on us.  When we have succeeded in repealing all the laws
<BR>
which I consider immoral, ask me again about surveilance cameras.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;	When I'm walking around with my friends, we often discuss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;possiblilities for the future--any and all, including futures in which the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;United States government no longer exists (we are none of us liable to act
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to further such a future, but it's awkward to insert disclaimers such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;this one into all of our statements).  This is definitely illegal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is absolutely *not* illegal.  We can discuss here in writing such 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possibilities with no fear of prosecution.  It's called the 1st Amendment.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unless when you *said* you &quot;discuss futures in which the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; United States government no longer exists&quot; what you *meant* was &quot;we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; affirmatively advocate in our discussions the violent overthrow of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government.&quot;  In that case, yes, you would be breaking the law, and you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would do well to keep such discussions secret, transparent society or no.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (In other words, if that *is* what you meant, it would *not* be a good idea 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to reply to this post by saying &quot;yeah, that's exactly what I meant&quot;, if you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know what I mean.)
</EM><BR>
<P>No, that's not what I meant.  However, looking above, I see that I was
<BR>
semantically inaccurate.  I didn't mean these conversations were actually
<BR>
illegal, I meant that they could be, in the government's view, 'probable
<BR>
cause for suspicion.'  This can be awfully inconvenient even for a
<BR>
law-abiding citizen--take as an example Steve Jackson Games, who got
<BR>
raided by the FBI on suspicion of computer crime for putting out a
<BR>
cyberpunk game.  Just because an action is legal doesn't mean a recording
<BR>
of it, especially out of context, can't get one into trouble.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;It says that I don't like being watched under the assumption that I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;going to do something nasty.  I don't like being stared at by policemen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;either.  I particularly don't like being watched by people I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;see.  This is a matter of aesthetic preference.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well yes, that is a matter of personal preference.  I personally don't mind 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being stared at by cops.  And I am not one to &quot;straighten my posture&quot; when I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know I'm being watched by authorities.  But this confidence no doubt comes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from a keen awareness of the law and my rights under it.  I know what I can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and cannot legally do, and I know what the cops can and cannot legally do to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me.  However, such confidence comes from a level of diligence and vigilence 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, I admit, not everyone wishes to invest.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know what the law is.  I know my rights under it.  I also know of many
<BR>
cases in which the government has bent the definitions of this law and
<BR>
ignored these rights.  
<BR>
<P>I know what the cops can and cannot legally do to me.  But I live in the
<BR>
New York City area.  I do have a certain security in not being a young
<BR>
black male, but my awareness of actual police behavior makes my trust in
<BR>
them less than absolute.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;While constraint of behavior is by no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;means equivalent to constraint of thought, the two do tend to go together
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;psychologically.  Certainly dialogue, or communicative behavior, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;constrained.  Furthermore, if people know the government is watching them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;at particular street-corners, they are likely to come into the habit of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;assuming surveilance elsewhere and modifying their behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;accordingly.  Therefore surveilance is likely to, long-run, decrease the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;flow of new ideas in public, and the diversity of public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;appearance/behavior.  This is not extropic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't agree.  I think it will lead to a lot more people paying closer 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attention to what the laws provide so that they can govern themselves in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public with the kind of confidence I discussed above.  Voluntarily modifying 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your own behavior because you aren't sure of the law is the lazy person's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way of avoiding trouble with the law.  *That* IMO is not extropic.  Liberty 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comes with a price, that price is responsibility.  One responsibility of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free citizen is to understand the law and (1) abide by it or (2) work to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change it.
</EM><BR>
<P>We on this list are looking to and working towards a future in which
<BR>
enhanced cognitive abilities will make it genuinely possible for everyone
<BR>
to keep up with all the information relevant to their lives and still have
<BR>
time to come up with new ideas and creations of their own.  In the
<BR>
meanwhile, most people have to pick and choose where they focus their
<BR>
information-gathering efforts.  As a highly educated person in an academic
<BR>
environment, I have access to some of the more efficient
<BR>
information-gathering processes currently available on the planet.  I try
<BR>
to take in information in several areas that interest me, including
<BR>
current and prospective law (regional and national), actual injustices
<BR>
(perpetrated by governments, corporations and individuals), cognitive
<BR>
science, neuropsychology, current cultural trends, and proto-extropian
<BR>
tech developments.  At a rough estimate, I either miss or receive late
<BR>
between 70 and 90 percent of information relevant to my life.  Given
<BR>
current technological capacity, no one can be called lazy merely for
<BR>
having missed some bandwidth.  You, for example, seem to have placed a
<BR>
great deal of emphasis on keeping up with legal policy.  This is to be
<BR>
commended.  However, one of the trade-offs seems to have been your missing
<BR>
information concerning times when law-abiding people have managed to get
<BR>
in trouble with the law, in spite of not actually having broken it.
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, most people, no matter how much effort they put into it, are
<BR>
not as confident as you are that they have *all* the relevant
<BR>
information.  This may not be ideal, and it may even say something about
<BR>
their perfection relative to your own.  However, most of these people are
<BR>
still capable of contributing to the novelty and diversity of the public
<BR>
sphere, and may be inhibited in doing so if they know they are being
<BR>
watched.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Living in ignorance of the law, and then cowering in fear that you might 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accidentally run afoul of it is not excuse enough for me to favor 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constraining the right of the public or the government to detect criminal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behavior, even by the admittedly drastic means of surveillance.  But I do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recognize that, as in most things, your mileage may vary.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not ignorant, but I do acknowledge that my information may not be
<BR>
complete.  I am not cowering, but I do base my caution levels on the
<BR>
information that I have.  The information that I have suggests that
<BR>
neither the government nor Lockheed-Martin can be trusted with the
<BR>
responsibility implicit in surveilance.
