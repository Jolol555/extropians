<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Man - have you really spent a lot of time in X-Windows?   Suitability?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; for the common Joe?  Come on.  I'd be suprised if you could install Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; on a new box and have XFree86 running in less than 5 attempts.
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you installed any recent releases of the major
<BR>
distributions? Mandrake typically installs complete with fully
<BR>
functional XF86 and a large collection of apps in about half the
<BR>
time of a typical win9x installation, and with only a single
<BR>
reboot at the end of the process. Granted, there can be time
<BR>
consuming snags if you have extremely new or very odd hardware,
<BR>
but the list of supported hardware is currently very large, and
<BR>
growing all the time. All of the recent (as in last 12 months or
<BR>
so) Mandrake installs I've done have been sucessful on the first
<BR>
try, and this is without having to call on any knowlege that any
<BR>
first-time Linux user wouldn't know. I'm much closer to the Linux
<BR>
newbie end of the newbie-expert spectrum myself.
<BR>
<P>This, in itself, doesn't make Linux superior. But it does shoot
<BR>
holes in the ease-of-installation claims of Windows superiority.
<BR>
Such claims never meant much anyway, even back when it was true.
<BR>
Casual users almost never install their own OS, and technical
<BR>
users aren't much bothered by a little extra installation
<BR>
complexity as long as there are other compelling reasons to use
<BR>
an OS.
<BR>
<P>If you started with a bare-bones GUI-less Linux installation,
<BR>
then tried to install XF86 on top of it, then your &quot;5 tries&quot;
<BR>
assessment might be realistic for non-expert users. But
<BR>
practically no one does it that way. Especially the &quot;common Joe&quot;.
<BR>
<P>As for the open-source vs. closed source hoopla, use and support
<BR>
whatever fills your needs and wants. Even if you make your choice
<BR>
on purely philosophical grounds, more power to ya. That's what
<BR>
individual freedom is all about. I don't even give a damn about
<BR>
&quot;letting the best development model win&quot;. There's room for more
<BR>
than one way to develop software, just like there's room for more
<BR>
than one way to think.
<BR>

<P>The future is ours to create.
