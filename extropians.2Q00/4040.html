<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Only curious: what art does Alex do?  I dabble in poetry, drawing, 
</EM><BR>
painting,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  and short stories.  In the past, I tried music and still have the urge to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  try that again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried several arts and had faily good success. Mainly I draw and 
<BR>
paint. I have done a few comissions of animal portraits but have only 
<BR>
recently tried a human portait, this being my wife. For some mad reason I 
<BR>
decided to do it using my pc with a mouse and mat, not tablet and stylus !. 
<BR>
It has come out fairly OK but still needs finishing.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned to play violin as a child and have taught myself to play a bit 
<BR>
of piano (keyboard), but I dont read music so I have to learn by ear and play 
<BR>
from memory. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also tried some artistic photography although this is an artform 
<BR>
that I would rather look at than participate in. I've also dabbled with the 
<BR>
written word, but my limited vocabulary and attention span usually mean that 
<BR>
I never finish a work.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  While I'm not strictly against the &quot;I know what I like&quot; school of art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  criticism, I don't think it's the end of esthetics.  After all, the 
</EM><BR>
question
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  is still there of why one likes what one likes.  Also, the question of why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  all human societies have art while extant nonhumans appear not to have it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  remains.  Also, the major art forms -- literature, painting, sculpture, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  music -- seem universal in human cultures.  Regardless of one's stand on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Rand's esthetics, these are still intriguing questions which she tried to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  answer or, at least, provide a framework for further research on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a basic human need to express our inner relationship 
<BR>
with the outside world or to show others and maybe ourselves what our 
<BR>
interpretation of the world is. I think that art has always been a way of 
<BR>
expressing the abstract things which are very difficult to comunicate with 
<BR>
other means. As the highest inteligence on earth we have developed the need 
<BR>
to comunicate these to others where as say chimps couldn't really give a 
<BR>
*monkeys* (sorry) whether the next chimp is passionate about a pretty flower.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im not sure what im getting at here ramble...ramble.......
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  No arguing with that.  No one really has to defend their taste.  
</EM><BR>
Personally,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I don't like and have never like Picasso, but I love van Gogh.  I didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  always feel this way about him, but the more I've looked at his works --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  quite a number in the flesh -- the more I like them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proves what you find esthetically pleasing has somehow changed as I 
<BR>
am sure that if I took the time to truely study Van Gough's art I would 
<BR>
probably come to like it. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I don't think Rand was asking you to substitute her mind and opinion for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  anyone's in her _The Romantic Manifesto_.  Even by her explicit theory, she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  distinguishes between personal tastes and esthetic evaluation/judgment.  
</EM><BR>
She
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  even gives examples of works she thinks are great but which did not like 
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  works she likes which are not great by her standards.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>One thing I must say that IMHO between Van Gough and Picasso, Van Gough was 
<BR>
probably the better painter. even though I don't like his work. This just 
<BR>
highlights the Personal taste vs esthetics issue.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  This is where the popular notion of &quot;guilty pleasures&quot; comes in.  No doubt,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  some of this is due to leftover cultural elitism, but I don't think this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  makes it completely invalid.  After all, sometimes our ideal of ourself is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  out of line with the reality.  Okay, most times our ideal is out of line
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  with it.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak for yourself, I really am ten feat tall and the best looking man in 
<BR>
the world.
