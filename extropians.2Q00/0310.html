<P>
I am excited!  David Pizer has taken the first big step by purchasing the 
<BR>
land for this project.  The vision he has must be nurtured and made real.  I 
<BR>
really could see it because of the word picture he drew.  The area of land 
<BR>
he bought sounds choice and should be perfect for what is needed.  I live in 
<BR>
Anchorage, Alaska but if I were close enough I would go and take a look at 
<BR>
the land.
<BR>
<P>I think this is what cryonics has been looking for.  A cryonicist enclave 
<BR>
like this could really capture the positive interest of the public and mass 
<BR>
media and help to focus our energies in a way that would really benefit 
<BR>
eachother.  It would be more then just a retirement community or a hospice 
<BR>
because with a resort on the premises, people could vacation there over the 
<BR>
years and learn to love the place and see it as a community for living and 
<BR>
growth instead just a place to await death.
<BR>
<P>I just hope it is designed to be affordable for all income levels.  A 
<BR>
powerful thrill shot through me as I read the post and I hope to feel even 
<BR>
greater excitement as I read in the future about how construction is going 
<BR>
on to make the dream a reality.  I wish best of luck to David Pizer and the 
<BR>
Venturists in this endeavor.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>

Subject: charitable funding of suspensions

<P>snip
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A charity would be a good way to solve this problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Such an organization could invest and accumulate money in a tax free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;environmnet and so fund research into cryonic suspension technology &gt;in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;addition to the occasional suspension.

<EM>&gt;Subject: RE: Dave Pizer's Cryonics Supportive Community
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The principal objection to Dave Pizer's proposal for the &gt;establishment of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a Cryonics Supoortive Community seems to be that &gt;many people do not want 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to ggive their home for a small apartment. &gt;This seems understandable.
</EM><BR>
<P>snip
<BR>
<P>We are finally moving forward.  I recently purchased 40 acres about one hour 
<BR>
drive north of Phoenix/Scottsdale.  This is in a rural area of 4000 foot 
<BR>
elevation.  There are retirement ranchettes (big house on 5 acres), a few 
<BR>
regular ranches and small towns in the area.  Prescott and Prescott Valley 
<BR>
(about 75,000 people) are 25 minutes to the west.  Sedona andOak Creek 
<BR>
Canyon are an hour to the north.
<BR>
<P>Except for one other 40 acre parcel of private land that is kitty-corner to 
<BR>
mine, my 40 acres is surrounded by State and Federal lands so no one else 
<BR>
can build next to my land.  If things work out, I might buy the other parcel 
<BR>
for future development.  There is a little brook that flows year round 
<BR>
through the middle of the property.  The brook has native cottonwoods, 
<BR>
Mesquites and other large trees, wild flowers in the spring and lots of 
<BR>
other bushes and plants. The animals come to the creek to drink: rabbits, 
<BR>
foxes, deer, lots of birds.
<BR>
<P>This is an area that is considered safe from earthquakes, floods and other 
<BR>
disasters.
<BR>
<P>This is truely a peaceful and secure place but just an hour drive from
<BR>
Phoenix with its state of the art medical care (a Mayo Clinic and a Mayo 
<BR>
Hospital).
<BR>
<P>I am hopeing to build a small resort with small cabins along the creek.Back 
<BR>
on the hills overlooking the creek, I would like the Society for Venturism 
<BR>
to build apartments or homes for cryonicists to buy, rent or lease.  These 
<BR>
would be either small or large depending on the tenant's needs and ability.
<BR>
<P>There could also be a hospice or in-home hospice service.  This is the
<BR>
parcel that I would like to create a cryonics community that I have seen a 
<BR>
need for.  A place where like-minded persons can work together to raise the 
<BR>
odds for mutiple survival.  Residents could have condo-like homes or 
<BR>
free-standing homes on larger parcels, like 1/2 acre.
<BR>
<P>We could have a community meeting building, a spa, exercise room (although 
<BR>
there are miles and miles or nature trails leading through the federal 
<BR>
forests that adjoin this parcel for hiking.
<BR>
<P>The income from  the resort portion might be used to create the cryonics 
<BR>
community.  There can also be buildings where cryonics volunteers can work 
<BR>
together to raise public awareness for life extension and also to raise 
<BR>
money for charitable help in underfunded suspensions.  We would need people 
<BR>
who are experts with computers, writers, public speakers, and other workers. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people could do radio talk shows and if we raise awareness,we could 
<BR>
supply guests for TV talk shows.  We might also have our own printing 
<BR>
equipment and publish magazines and books on cryonics, life extension and 
<BR>
other related topics.
<BR>
<P>The next step is to raise the money to build the public resort portion. I 
<BR>
may be able to have that by the end of this year. In the meantime, people 
<BR>
interested can throw out ideas for discussion.
<BR>
<P>What can develop there in the way of a supportive community will depend on 
<BR>
the people that are willing to join together and make this happen.  All 
<BR>
cryonicists and their ideas are welcome.
<BR>
<P><P>Dave Pizer
