<EM>&gt; &gt; Last night I watched a chilling BBC program by a journo who infiltrated a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bunch of soccer thugs in Britain and furtively filmed their antics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; boasts. These were not stupid men, by and large. Some of them had (or once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; had) reasonably demanding jobs. They just lerrrrved smacking and bashing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the shit out of other people. Their blood was up, it boiled with rage and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; delight, they had flow and peak experience. There's going to be a lot of it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; going around, even if Banks's Culture emerges.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And please don't tell me this won't happen if everyone's packing heat (as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they used to say on the mean streets)

<EM>&gt; I read this recently, in regards to hooligan British soccer or &quot;football&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fans:  <A HREF="http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v00/n811/a04.html?156456">http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v00/n811/a04.html?156456</A>.  The website
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tracks newspaper articles on certain issues.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>The article is one describing how British football hooligans were extraordinarily
<BR>
docile whilst in Amsterdam, many of them quite happily stoned on cannabis.  There
<BR>
was question as to whether this gentleness would continue to the next game played
<BR>
where only alcohol was available to open the recreational floodgates:  it did
<BR>
not.  The beer-fueled British football hooliganism was on the televised news,
<BR>
where it is old news, with no mention of the prior peace.  An inside joke, as it
<BR>
were.
<BR>
<P>Here in America, we are at a point where both major party presidential candidates
<BR>
have admitted drug use.  There are even allegations that Bush (sometimes British
<BR>
slang for marijuana) failed to complete required physicals during his military
<BR>
tenure that would have required specific question and tests about drug use, and
<BR>
is now a teetotaler.  Gore simply admits having regularly used recreational
<BR>
cannabis.  Clinton had tip-toed around the marijuana issue, who knows or cares
<BR>
what he is on today.  Many high-ranking intelligence officials are exposed to
<BR>
various hallucinogens.
<BR>
<P>Well then, in the sense of this thread's context of &quot;communist nonsense&quot;, I will
<BR>
put forth that drug prohibition is actually &quot;authoritarian statist nonsense&quot;.
<BR>
<P>In the terms of British football hooligans vis-a-vis gun violence, the largest
<BR>
cause of gun violence in the United States over the past twenty years is the
<BR>
illegalization and thus black-marketization of drugs, which will always have
<BR>
buyers and sellers.  Thus, if drugs were not illegal for adults, then there would
<BR>
be much less violence.  Sad to say, in a way, the most violent have weeded each
<BR>
other out already.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps this is &quot;preaching to the choir&quot;, as it were, but the time for the repeal
<BR>
of government &quot;control&quot; of substances has come and gone long ago.
<BR>
