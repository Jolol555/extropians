<EM>&gt; Huh? Now you are making no sense at all.  What &quot;If&quot;?? That's the whole point,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no one has yet been able to duplicate any said function.  You're caught in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some weird self referential tautology!  You might want to clear your head
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and start reading this discussion from the beginning since the crux of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument has obviously lost you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so.  It may not be in Moravec's Robots book, but it is detailed quite
<BR>
clearly in his Mind Children book.  Moravec knows what the optic nerve
<BR>
does at least to the degree of edge recognition, aggregating similarly
<BR>
colored shapes next to each other into &quot;objects&quot;, etc. and has spent
<BR>
20+ years attempting to program computers to do the same thing (namely, to
<BR>
navigate through visual recognition of the world around you).  The fact
<BR>
that they can get a van to drive itself across the country with the
<BR>
robot in control 95% of the time shows that they have a very *good*
<BR>
estimate of the amount of computer power that *is* required to &quot;see&quot;
<BR>
and drive an automobile.
<BR>
<P>My comment to Eliezer was intended to observe the fact that much
<BR>
of that seems to now have been reduced to a $6.00 chip.  So the
<BR>
&quot;software&quot; that Moravec needs all the MIPs for can in fact be
<BR>
redeveloped in &quot;hardware&quot; that doesn't need nearly so many MIPS.
<BR>
The conclusion I draw from that is that *when* one understands
<BR>
exactly what it is the neurons are &quot;computing&quot;, you can develop
<BR>
software and hardware that do it more effectively.  One function
<BR>
the brain does (usually poorly) is &quot;spell check&quot;.  I can write
<BR>
programs that do it fairly fast and if there were enough demand
<BR>
people could write hardware that could do it even faster.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As the 1992 study of the Purkinje demonstrates, it was an extremely difficult
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; task to simulate the function of a single neuron - and this was an admittedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simplified simulation at that.  It took an i860 processor almost 60 minutes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simulate a single firing!  So the question still remains how many xflops it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to take to simulate a *typical* neuron of the human brain not including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any of its self-maintenance functions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>So?  It would take less-specialized hardware &amp; software (say the program
<BR>
they are using, translated into Bliss-10, running on a PDP-10 simulator
<BR>
running on an old klunking PDP-11 [I actually wrote a simulator to
<BR>
do this once, simulating 36 bit words on a 16 bit machine, fun...])
<BR>
*MUCH* longer than an hour to run the simulation.  If they increased
<BR>
the number of synapses or decreased the granularity of their simulation
<BR>
(to say the atomic scale), it would take much longer as well.
<BR>
<P>As Anders' pointed out, the degree of &quot;accuracy&quot; you get depends on
<BR>
the hardware and software you have available and how many &quot;compromises&quot; 
<BR>
you have to make to get the results in something less than a month.
<BR>
If you are satisfied that the abstractions in your model are sufficently
<BR>
accurate or spend the time to develop very specialized hardware then
<BR>
you can run things much faster.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So far both Robin Hanson and Anders Sandberg admit that a single transistor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't going to do the job.  That much we all agree on.  What exactly are you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arguing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>True, because a single transistor is designed as a switch, while a neuron
<BR>
is a multiply-adder.  So what you really need is arrays of DSP chips.
<BR>
These have been built, I believe Columbia has one that is pretty large.
<BR>
But even the largest (10K+ DSP chips?) are still small compared with
<BR>
the number of neurons (billions).  They compensate for this by being
<BR>
somewhat faster (millions/sec vs. 100s-1000s/sec).  In terms of #'s
<BR>
of transistors you can probably do this with 1K to 100K transistors
<BR>
depending on how many &quot;bits&quot; of accuracy you need (neurons are probably
<BR>
more than 1-bit devices but probably much less than 16-bit devices).
<BR>
<P>*However*, neurons may be relatively &quot;fuzzy&quot; devices, meaning they
<BR>
can be more effectively implemented using analog rather than digital
<BR>
logic.  I think the transistor count drops by 1-2 orders of magnitude
<BR>
when you implement multiply-adders in analog rather than digital logic.
<BR>
<P>The real issue that I believe is being &quot;poked&quot; at here is whether or
<BR>
not various brain functions are well enough understood that you can
<BR>
implement hardware+software that produces the function for fewer &quot;IPs&quot;
<BR>
than the brain.  I'd say there are a whole *host* of things: arithmetic,
<BR>
symbolic logic (to a degree), sorting, spell-checking, language
<BR>
recognition, language translation (coming slowly), message passing
<BR>
and routing, character &quot;recognition&quot;, limited reading (OCR), most game
<BR>
playing (the only exception left is Go), driving automobiles,
<BR>
complex simulations or phenomena from quantum mechanics to weather,
<BR>
are among those &quot;brain functions&quot; where software and hardware have
<BR>
trumped the brain completely.  The areas we have to wrestle with
<BR>
now are pattern recognition, common sense knowledge bases, language
<BR>
&quot;comprehension&quot; and a few more.
<BR>
<P>The question becomes, in 10, 20, 30 years, *what* will be the brain
<BR>
functions that are *not* well enough understood that we cannot
<BR>
implement them on top-down designed software+hardware and must
<BR>
resort to atomic, molecular or &quot;systems&quot; simulations of neural
<BR>
networks on the hardware available at that time to produce those
<BR>
functions?
<BR>
<P>Billy's point is that it doesn't matter how many MIPs the brain
<BR>
takes to do something (especially things it wasn't designed to
<BR>
do well such as arithmetic), if we can build machines that do
<BR>
those things.  Since we already have people &quot;seeing&quot; with the
<BR>
retinal cells being replaced by chips and &quot;walking&quot; with
<BR>
spinal neurons replaced by chip signal &quot;routers&quot;, the question
<BR>
becomes how far into the complexity of the brain can this extend
<BR>
before we get lost and have to resort to the simulations of the neurons?
<BR>
Looking at this from the programming perspective, we are going
<BR>
top-down after functional equivalents.  The question is can
<BR>
we take that all the way to the bottom, or at some point do
<BR>
we have to resort to bottom-up simulations to fill in the things
<BR>
that we don't understand?
<BR>
<P>To my mind, its going to get *very* interesting if someone develops
<BR>
a chip for the Calvin &quot;hexagons&quot; and decides to augment some of their
<BR>
neocortex with a chip add-on pack.  Then you could envision replacing
<BR>
the whole neocortical surface with a replacement microelectrial
<BR>
implementation once the functional microelectronic circuit densities
<BR>
fall below functional neuronal densities.  You then get a combination
<BR>
e-en-human where the higher thoughts are being carried out in new,
<BR>
faster e-hardware, while all the old interfaces to the body and the
<BR>
emotional strings in the reptilian part of the brain are still being
<BR>
handled by old bio-hardware.
