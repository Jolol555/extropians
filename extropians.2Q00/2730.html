<EM>&gt; The really big thing was that the winnings were untaxed in any way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Apparently gambling winnings in the U.S. by a foreigner do not (or at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the time did not) subject you to U.S. taxes, and Australia (like many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; former British Commonwealth countries) has no tax on gambling.  So the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consortium would just pocket the profits.  After they walked away with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many millions from (I think) Tennessee there were rumors that either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the U.S. or Tennessee might start imposing a special tax on winnings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for people who cover more than some large fraction of the lottery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; numbers.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is always a tax. Capital gains taxes are assessed on businesses,
<BR>
and income taxes on individuals. The operatives the company was sending
<BR>
around to buy tickets had to either be residents or have green cards, in
<BR>
which case if a ticket they bought won, they'd have to pay 39% income
<BR>
tax to the government, then the company that paid them could collect any
<BR>
winnings after that, and they'd have to pay a 28% corporate income tax
<BR>
at least to get any money out of the country. 
<BR>
<P>The only time I ever heard of someone really getting away with not
<BR>
paying 'his fair share' was a case where a guy bought a ticket and won a
<BR>
$990,000.00 jackpot. On monday morning he had already gotten some sort
<BR>
of limited partnership business organized or something, such that his
<BR>
annualized payments of $49,500.00 from the state were just under the
<BR>
legal limit of $50,000.00 to have to pay taxes using that business
<BR>
model, so I think he got away with paying no taxes.
<BR>
<P>Even with these numbers though, it might be a decent deal, however,
<BR>
buying every possible number combination ranges from 7 million up to 70
<BR>
million dollars in ticket buys. The state typically keeps half to two
<BR>
thirds of the total amount even before the jackpot is made, and then you
<BR>
also have subsidiary prizes. 
<BR>
<P>Many lotteries though seem to have about 1/4 to 1/3 of the numbers that
<BR>
are far more frequent than the other numbers (more than you'd see from a
<BR>
statistical average) so you can improve your odds by focusing on these
<BR>
numbers. Additionally, a 1 in 70 million odds lotery typically doesn't
<BR>
have more than 5-15 million tickets sold in each lottery period. Any
<BR>
prize money in excess is rollover from the previous period. The key is
<BR>
to use the number frequency data and only buy tickets in lotteries that
<BR>
have a lot of rollover, especially if the rollover is in excess of the
<BR>
odds of winning. As the present Big Game jackpot is, at something like
<BR>
$235 million on 1:70 million odds, the one time payment is $120 million.
<BR>
Thus if you bought 70 million dollars in tickets, the prize would be
<BR>
$305 million due to unexpected sales (yours), so even if three other
<BR>
people also won the same number, you'd still make money on the deal.
