<P><EM>&gt; Would you feel any more or less upset if I instead told you that someone

<EM>&gt; had made a copy of you and then killed him?
</EM><BR>
<P>No difference.  Making a copy before killing me is no different then letting
<BR>
my genetics live on through my children before killing me, or letting my
<BR>
memory live on in the mind of others before killing me.  It might be a nice
<BR>
touch, but I'm still dead.  The new guy is alive, but I'm still dead.  We
<BR>
are identical, except I'm dead and he's not.  I would argue that this is the
<BR>
biggest divergence that two copies can have to diverge into two separate
<BR>
individuals.
<BR>
<P>What if I you tortured or raped or wounded instead of killed?  Does having a
<BR>
copy lessen your damages?  Should you be unable to pursue a criminal
<BR>
conviction of the attacker if you had a backup copy?  Does that make the
<BR>
attack not occur?  The only reason that killing seems to work is the bogus
<BR>
argument that the dead guy can't object.  If I were reanimated after being
<BR>
killed, I would start objecting again.  I object as the murder is being
<BR>
carried out, and if I could, I would object afterwards.
<BR>
<P>Most arguments state that the copies cannot be allowed to diverge.  I submit
<BR>
that death for one copy and life for another is about the biggest divergence
<BR>
that can occur.  What about the possibility of reanimation of the dead body
<BR>
in the future?  Does this retroactively make the killing a killing whereas
<BR>
it wasn't before the original was reanimated?  Do you have to destroy the
<BR>
original body beyond reanimation for it to be considered not to be murder?
