</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can I grow my own food, build my own shelter, look for work,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and (re)educate myself all at the same time?  I'm doubtful.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I can't answer that question for you, but I CAN say that it's possible to do
<BR>
it, because it's what I'm doing.  At the moment I'm making money by doing
<BR>
bookkeeping and tax return preparation for a few clients; making concrete
<BR>
donuts to go around lawn sprinkler heads;  from time to time I sell art
<BR>
work; once in a great while I sell stuff I write to magazines.  The most
<BR>
important thing to me about working for money, though, is that I DON'T HAVE
<BR>
TO DO IT IN ORDER TO LIVE.  If I don't make any money for a while, it's OK.
<BR>
I have zero debt.  I pay zero taxes, other than advalorem taxes on the land
<BR>
and state sales tax (technically I do pay a bit of FICA tax, but the &quot;earned
<BR>
income credit&quot; offsets it).  Almost 100% of every dollar I make is mine to
<BR>
spend as I please. I spend around five hours per week doing accounting work;
<BR>
seven hours per week doing the concrete donuts (there seems to be a rather
<BR>
large demand for the things, so I may end up having to hire some help in
<BR>
order to keep doing the other things I want to do); the art work comes in
<BR>
spurts, so I might spend hours and hours one week and then not touch it
<BR>
again for a couple of months; the writing's the same as the art work only
<BR>
not as lucrative (it pays almost nothing, so I probably shouldn't really
<BR>
count it as money work, more like just a compulsion).
<BR>
<P>I spend two or three hours per day in the garden, but most of that's spent
<BR>
on ornamental plants or expanding the garden beds rather than maintaining
<BR>
the food crops.  If I were just tending a food garden, it would probably
<BR>
average 15 or 20 minutes per day (more in some seasons, less in others). (in
<BR>
the interest of not being misleading, I should say that I DO buy food at the
<BR>
grocery store sometimes, but, like earning the money, it's something I don't
<BR>
HAVE to do). My daughter helps with the work, too, but it doesn't cut too
<BR>
seriously into her teenager stuff like talking on the phone for hours or
<BR>
going places with her friends. (again, in the interest of not being
<BR>
misleading, my daughter's covered by her dad's medical insurance--if this
<BR>
weren't the case I'd want to earn enough money to cover that)
<BR>
<P>The hovel is an ongoing project, but the basic shelter with kitchen, 2 small
<BR>
bedrooms, and bathroom took a couple of months to build.  I didn't know
<BR>
squat about building houses when I started out, and my plan was to hire
<BR>
someone to build the house, but a family emergency came up, and I had to
<BR>
spend all the money I'd saved on that, so I was left having to scrounge for
<BR>
materials and do the work myself.  It's turned out to be surprisingly fun. I
<BR>
spend about five or six hours per week working on house projects.  This week
<BR>
I'm putting lath up on my 2-story guest house, which has been quite a
<BR>
triumph for me, because I'm afraid of heights. Something I've been wanting
<BR>
to do for a long time is to design and build a wood-burning kiln for firing
<BR>
clay.
<BR>
<P>I'm currently studying the following subjects, using books from the
<BR>
Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos and supplementing the books
<BR>
with info off the internet, and I've found that many university professors
<BR>
or other experts are very happy to answer questions via e-mail (or in person
<BR>
if I find someone within easy driving distance of where I live):  fuzzy
<BR>
logic, molecular genetics of plants, C4 plant biology, and C++ (I'm
<BR>
embarrassed to say that the only computer languages I know are Fortran,
<BR>
COBOL, and Basic.  That pretty much dates me, doesn't it? The first &quot;real&quot;
<BR>
job I ever had was working for Houston Lighting and Power Company, and when
<BR>
you ran a program on the computer, you had to run the Fortran compiler via a
<BR>
stack of punched cards about 2 feet high).
<BR>
<P>So, yeah, a person can grow their own food, build their own shelter, educate
<BR>
themselves (for me education is a fun, never-ending process), and look for
<BR>
work--or do the work, as the case may be, and have time left over for
<BR>
socializing, listening to music, reading novels, just hanging out, or
<BR>
whatever.
