<EM>&gt; No, it isn't force. But what's wrong with drawing an analogy between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physical force and economic force: both can reduce the efficiency of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market by artificially restricting choice. Microsoft certainly isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to shoot me if I don't buy Windows, but in an unregulated market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they can make it infeasible to do otherwise. More importantly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allowing them to do so engineers a fitness function where size and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brutality are selected ahead of price and quality. Do we want a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; product to do well because it's tied to something, or because it best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fulfills some sectors needs?
</EM><BR>
<P>What makes you think antitrust law is an improvement? As I've already said,
<BR>
the market does tend to correct these situations on its own, and government
<BR>
intervention dramatically undermines the natural corrective process. I want a
<BR>
good argument for thinking antitrust laws will be better than the market's
<BR>
natural corrective mechanisms (and, since we are also trampling on private
<BR>
property rights and inviting a morass of anti-competitive regulation, it needs
<BR>
to be a very good argument).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And it's absurd to equate antitrust with a system where government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arbitrarily interferes with every contract and the terms of every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business agreement. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Why is it absurd? Unless you have  avery strong demarcation between
<BR>
permissible and impermissible interventions, a government agency charged with
<BR>
enforcing antitrust law will naturally become more and more interventionist
<BR>
over time. The end result is someting like the SCC regulation of commodity
<BR>
trading - an omnipresent blanket of senseless regulation that strangles
<BR>
everything it touches.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd agree with you here, that was probably a bad example. I'd add
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though that reforms in intellectual property law might provide an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; optimal solution to natural monopolies in the software industry: 5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; year copyrights, for instance, would allow a vendor to make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonable return on development investment while lowering the barrier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to entry for competitors to something surmountable. This year, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instance, we'd be seeing the first wave of Windows 95 derivatives. MS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have a huge head start, as they should, but we'd actually start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seeing a bit of diversity.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd be in favor of a major reworking of intellectual property law - it is
<BR>
pretty obvious that what we have now does not deal well with the realities of
<BR>
modern technology. But once agian, this is not a problem with free markets. If
<BR>
you think the current intellectual property regime stifles innovation the
<BR>
answer is to change the relevant laws, not to go around confiscating patents
<BR>
from anyone who seems to benifit from them &quot;too much&quot;. Government agencies are
<BR>
far too irresponsible to be trusted with that kind of authority.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That's a valid argument - regulation could help, but government can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be trusted to do more good than harm. I live in a rent controlled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apartment but I'm ambivalent about whether that does any good or it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just discourages new housing construction. It seems though that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; letting an owner charge a new tenant whatever he wants then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; restricting the pace at which he can increase it is a reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compromise. You try to approximate the best of both worlds, find a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working medium between equally compelling arguments.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. And before we pass such a law, we should demand actual evidence that it
<BR>
make things better. Almost our entire current regulatory regime was enacted on
<BR>
nothing more substantial that wishful thinking, (or worse, a blind urge to &quot;do
<BR>
something&quot; in order to curry favor and/or look important) and almost all of it
<BR>
does more harm than good.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you find not being able to yell fire in a crowded theater an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ominous trend? There's nothing arbitrary or senseless about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ruling, disagree with it though you might. Whether it's expensive, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether it'll just be another MS stock split, only time can tell.
</EM><BR>
<P>I call the MS ruling arbitrary and senseless because it is not based on any
<BR>
sort of objective standard. If I don't want ot be arrested for shouting &quot;fire&quot;
<BR>
in a crowded thatre, all I have to do is refrain from doing so. In contrast,
<BR>
there is no course of action Microsoft could have taken that would have
<BR>
protected it form an antitrust suit. The laws are so vauge that a hostile
<BR>
judge can plausibly find any successful business guilty of 'illegal'
<BR>
activities, and impose pretty much any penalty he feels like levying. That
<BR>
isn't justice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; -matt (Is this as bad as the gun debate? I can't tell from the inside...)
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, it isn't nearly as bad. We aren't calling each other names, and neither of
<BR>
us is posting ten times a day, so I think we're in pretty good shape.
