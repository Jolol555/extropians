<P>Star Trek is simply a _soap_opera_.
<BR>
<P>Soaps are stereotypic so people can immediately recognize themselves
<BR>
without having to look at all the umpteen parts of a series.
<BR>
<P>_Of_course_ the series is a stereotype.  It wouldn't sell if it wasn't.
<BR>
Star Trek, like all soaps, comes with holes inside the programme to
<BR>
put the commercials.  A U.S. TV programme without commercials is a dead
<BR>
programme. The trekkers/trekkies/whatever would never support a series
<BR>
if it changed _anything_ from their known &quot;universe&quot;. They can discuss
<BR>
forever what some obscure thingie means. They are the audience.
<BR>
<P>No audience, no commercials, no money, no show.
<BR>
<P>You don't mess with the audience when the audience pays your salary.
