Bonnie forwards an article from Lee Flier:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; However, there are huge downsides to public companies, which are rarely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussed.  How many times have you complained that a company you used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frequent and trust as a customer has suddenly begun producing lower quality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; products, or has stopped caring about customer service?  How many of you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have ever been employed by a company who used to treat workers fairly but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit by bit begins to expect too much work for too little pay, to downgrade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working conditions, and to hire less and less competent new people as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competent ones are laid off or quit in disgust?  Or has a business who once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; served your community well just up and moved somewhere else in order to cut
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corners, leaving a huge void of jobs, goods or services?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All of these things are almost inevitable when a company goes public.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Generally, the negative effects will not begin to make themselves felt until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the corporation has been publicly held for at least 10 to 20 years, by which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time the founders of the company may well have retired with a fat bank
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; account.  That is why we usually don't connect the company's going public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with its downslide.
</EM><BR>
<P>If it really takes 10-20 years after going public before these negative
<BR>
effects appear, it is hard to be sure that these changes are in fact
<BR>
due to going public.  Isn't it just as likely that they are caused
<BR>
by mere age?  Old companies may become untrenched and inefficient, as
<BR>
employees fall into ruts after decades doing the same jobs.  Or perhaps
<BR>
they are caused by growth.  Big companies may become more bureaucratic
<BR>
and less focused on the customers.  Going public is just one of the steps
<BR>
companies often take as they grow, it would not be the causative factor
<BR>
in all the bad impacts of growth.
<BR>
<P>In general the article was full of generalities.  It would be better if
<BR>
the author described specific case studies in detail, naming companies
<BR>
which had suffered as a result of going public.  There are, after all,
<BR>
obvious counter examples of companies which have thrived and satisfied
<BR>
their customers despite being public - just look at the Fortune 100 or
<BR>
any other list of old, established, successful companies.
