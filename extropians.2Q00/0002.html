<P><EM>&gt; As Anders requested I sent off his story to a list who could be considered 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumanist 'racialists.' lol  These were their reactions.  By the way, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what is a 'jävla tönt'?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think a translation would be &quot;Damn dork&quot;. :-)

<EM>&gt; &gt;Hello everyone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    hey Griggy! Long time no arrogant whine! ;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Nevertheless, it's nice to see anders et al. have an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    positive view of the future, seeing as how we're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    de-evolving into a less capable species due to righteous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    anti-eugenicists such as yourself, it's good to know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    you dont have any problem with your complicity in it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    TRASH-humanists, striving together for a coercive utopia...
</EM><BR>
<P>:-) So he completely missed the point of the story?
<BR>
<P>As for the devolution, it is on such a tremendously longer timescale
<BR>
than cultural and technological evolution that it is irrelevant for
<BR>
all practical transhumanist aims. We have the technology ~now to start
<BR>
fixing bad genes or at least do prenatal screening, and in the short
<BR>
run we will likely see genetic enhancements. Things like devolution
<BR>
and race will not survive that long outside small groups. The nicest
<BR>
thing is that by leaving the choice up to the parents one can get a
<BR>
distributed, non-coercive system that still achieves the eugenic aims.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    BTW, swedes, espc. those not out of their &quot;equiv&quot; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    graduate school, are not really know for their 'science'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    'cocktail viruses' really, you should write for Star Trek.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Of course, he COULD be an expert, as you say, with an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    awful publishing record. Most neurology experts have enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    knowledge not to pander antisense oligonucleotide virus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    gene therapy (in the embryo!!) to anyone but true deludes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    such as yourself. Not their field, not yours either.
</EM><BR>
<P>:-)

<EM>&gt; In Sweden, to the middle and the upper classes, race
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issues are still on an academic level. I'd like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; check back on this person in a few years just to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how he changed his mind. Tell yout friend he's a jävla
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tönt.
</EM><BR>
<P>:-)
<BR>
<P>Sure, race issues are sensitive and totally PC here in Sweden. 
<BR>
<P>My impression is that the readers didn't quite get what I was aiming
<BR>
at. Transhumanism + racism will end up becoming transhumanism anyway -
<BR>
if you believe we can change the human condition drastically, then
<BR>
puny things like race is becoming *IRRELEVANT*. Who cares if your
<BR>
neighbour had black parents when his skin now is silver and his genes
<BR>
come from 43 different species?  Who cares if his home culture was
<BR>
American when he has modified his personality and adapted to several
<BR>
globalized net cultures. This is likely even more frightening for the
<BR>
PC crowd than the racists...
