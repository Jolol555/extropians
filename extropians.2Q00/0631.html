<P>The (shop-)counter argument is presumably that a market offers the option
<BR>
of many different choices on display, with no obligation to purchase any.
<BR>
If your (or my) political arrangements are less exhaustive, whose fault is
<BR>
that?
<BR>
<P>(As an ignorant and provincial Aussie, I'm simply flabbergasted by the
<BR>
rumour I hear that in order to vote in the USA, citizens are required first
<BR>
to *register* with *one of the parties*, although apparently they're
<BR>
allowed to change their vote once inside the booth [and even write in a
<BR>
candidate's name, a cool choice not offered here]... Can this be true? The
<BR>
mind genuinely boggles.)
<BR>
<P>Equally boggling to an outsider might be *our* laws penalising those who
<BR>
*don't* turn up at the polling booth. You're not obliged to vote, just to
<BR>
take your pieces of paper, have your name signed off, and put them--checked
<BR>
&nbsp;or otherwise--into the boxes. I rather like this practice, actually. If
<BR>
you're going to have the pretence of free and universal representative
<BR>
government, you might as well powerfully encourage everyone to confront the
<BR>
choices on offer. Those who oppose compulsion can pay the fine, after all,
<BR>
a sort of market solution.
<BR>
<P>But I do like Matt's insight.
