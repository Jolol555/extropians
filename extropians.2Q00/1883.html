<P><EM>&gt; Rationalists apply a critical analysis to truth statements not possible -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or at least only partially possible - in these other modes.  Thus a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rationalist may well judge one bridge as more beautiful than another,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but doesn't mistake that aesthetic judgment for one concerning the bridge's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strength (although the two judgments may well be intimately interconnected).
</EM><BR>
<P>I cna think of at least five ways a rationalist could judge the &quot;beauty&quot;
<BR>
of a bridge: (a) that which requires the least material to construct;
<BR>
(b) that which uses the least energy to construct; (c) that which is
<BR>
the least expensive to construct; (d) that which can be constructed
<BR>
the fastest; and (e) that which requires the least long term maintenance.
<BR>
<P>I would consider all of these outside of the realm of traditional
<BR>
aesthetics.  Which raises an interesting question: Is aesthetics
<BR>
(of the art appreciation form), &quot;rational&quot; or is there a fair
<BR>
amount of arbitrary &quot;opinion&quot; thrown in?  For example, I have
<BR>
strong suspicions that at the level of things like championship
<BR>
ballroom dancing, ice skating, olympic gymnastics, etc. the
<BR>
performances may be relatively &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;aesthetics&quot; may
<BR>
lie to a great degree in the cultural perspective or even
<BR>
politics of the judges.
<BR>
<P>Rational judgements may be highly masked or indirect, for example,
<BR>
current theories in sociobiology, perhaps extended in &quot;Survival of the
<BR>
Prettiest: The Science of Beauty&quot; argue that &quot;beauty&quot; is a biomarker
<BR>
for health and reproductive capability.  That is perhaps one of the
<BR>
most important criteria for &quot;rational&quot; judgements (typically managed
<BR>
by our &quot;lizard brain&quot;) in biology.
