Just bouncing a random idea off the list.
<BR>
<P>If, as some have suggested, the main ways that people learn new things
<BR>
are to make analogies to things they already know and, when that
<BR>
fails, to come up with totally new theories and try them, then could
<BR>
intelligence be defined as a combination of one's abilities to...
<BR>
* determine the correct model, out of all currently known models, to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;apply to a situation (which could be separated into knowing lots of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;models and being able to spot relevant similarities)
<BR>
* determine when a situation is sufficiently different (again, judging
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by relevant similarities) from known models that applying known models
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;would provide little benefit (and, in fact, may do harm by suggesting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;false analogies)
<BR>
* dream up (or, when possible and preferable, observe and imitate) new
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;models and refine them through simulation and/or application
<BR>
...?
