<HR NOSHADE><P>

<P>
The article is available at <A HREF="http://www.feedmagazine.com/dna/wildfall.html">http://www.feedmagazine.com/dna/wildfall.html</A>.
<BR>
<P>This is at base just more of the sentitious bombast, starting from silly
<BR>
premises and ending in the same predictable sermon, of which I've grown
<BR>
very weary.  I'll briefly comment on some of the text.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already we see it coming: prolonged battles of months, maybe years, but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;battles with beige
<BR>
<P>As Infocom's Enchanter might say, [I've known strange people, but fighting
<BR>
a color?].
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chemistry between a potential market of six billion and the greed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or altruism (it doesn't matter which) of corporations would, without
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doubt, change forever what it means to be a human being.
<BR>
<P>Right: it doesn't matter which, for the purposes of this essay.  I don't
<BR>
want intrusive, imperious corporations to take over my life or science any
<BR>
more than they already have.  So let's deal with your philosophical / moral
<BR>
/ theoretical concern.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to think intelligently, debate intelligently, we must ask
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ourselves this: Is there a threshold where intentionally changing the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biology of human nature violates life irrevocably?
<BR>
<P>A meaningless or suspiciously obscure question is not a very good beginning
<BR>
to an intelligent debate.  What could it possibly mean to [violate life
<BR>
irrevocably]?  Changing human nature: aside from some more or less semantic
<BR>
quibbles we know what you mean: changing the current physiology, anatomy,
<BR>
genetic form, et cetera of what we consider homo sapiens.  Violating life:
<BR>
we don't know what you mean.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engineering our bodies to achieve results would only ratchet up
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spending along the present path. {. . .}
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing would have a heyday in goosing up all-American bodies
<BR>
<P>What happened to the philosophical/theoretical question?  Paragraphs of
<BR>
discussion about biotechnology companies and a concern about spending and
<BR>
marketing.  I recommend that to some extent we deal with these issues 
<BR>
separately: not everyone who wants to use the technology approves of the
<BR>
corporate or industrial attitude toward things.  They are interrelated;
<BR>
but only insofar, perhaps, as certain aspects are concerned.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existence, the matter of it -- our bodies, our being, the living world
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around us -- is on the line as it has never been before, and never will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be again. Which is good, not depressing.
<BR>
<P>A pleasant surprise here, I guess.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT IS HERE THAT we return to defining the threshold of life: There is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no way that obtaining &quot;wares&quot; for the human body will somehow make us
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more alive, more us.
<BR>
<P>It is here that we return to speaking nonsense.  No one is suggesting that
<BR>
adding to the human system will make us more [human]; we are what we
<BR>
are---our definitions follow.  Using [alive] and [us] in this context is
<BR>
unclear and distracting---I can imagine long, pointless arguments over this
<BR>
point because these terms are not defined.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we strip any form of life, any creation -- including our own -- of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its own self-organizing, self-willing capacity simply to further ideas
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ends of our own, that life is no longer wild.
<BR>
<P>Your definition.  One which naively draws very sharp lines around a very
<BR>
complex reality.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's an immeasurable relief to admitting that life is fearsome, is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ecstatic, and is what it is because we {. . .} are mortal.
<BR>
<P>Remember that term you mentioned, [deathist]?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly, the idea of resurrecting ourselves or woolly mammoths from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;icy tombs generations or centuries later, or of changing the genetic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lines for future human beings, ignores something so basic to the way
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life is --
<BR>
<P>Which is what?  That organisms wander through the universe entirely
<BR>
passively, wholly and only patients?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that our &quot;victory&quot; over the transiently fragile, evocative milieu of a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world living in time and space rings without conviction, as hollowly as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an outright denial of a living world itself.
<BR>
<P>Your point through the rhetoric?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THRESHOLDS OF THE BIOLOGICAL world, ourselves included, are crossed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when we willingly create the fall of the wild: a world that fails to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call all intelligence forward into a point of view.
<BR>
<P>Again, I'm not sure what this (the last phrase in particular) is supposed
<BR>
to mean.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last twenty years, from repeated testings of four
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand participants, the senses of smell, taste, touch, sight, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hearing have decreased at a rate of nearly one percent per year.
<BR>
<P>I'm guessing that this isn't as simple as it sounds.  Nevertheless such
<BR>
research could lead to some interesting conclusions.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data shows that the unconscious has risen from eighty-seven percent of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total brain processing to ninety-four percent.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps you were reading the parody version of the research you mentioned.
<BR>
That sentence is just fantastic.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our brain is not adapting. It is rebelling against the world and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changing it [the world] by changing itself.
<BR>
<P>It seems that these two sentences are at least partially contradictory.
<BR>
Secondly, the brain is rather known for its inclination to change itself.
<BR>
Little things like language might have emerged because of it.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate I'd like to see recognizes that even our best-case scenario
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of debating technological efficacy, safety, or rights won't work.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{. . . S}tandards of proof won't in themselves prevent an American-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going-global civilization now being imagined and created by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bioengineering technologies.
<BR>
<P>You're switching topics again.  If you want to express concern over the
<BR>
American corporationization of the world (a legitimate concern) then do so.
<BR>
I'm not convinced that this so directly affects your attack on the basic
<BR>
notion of rebuilding oneself and crossing your threshold.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate would return us to life as imagined and created
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organismically, within parameters of what it means to be alive in space
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and time.
<BR>
<P>Again, what this is supposed to mean?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate would insist on understanding human nature as wild, and it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would begin with this premise: We refuse to become engineered ghosts, a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;species that becomes the walking undead.
<BR>
<P>And we refuse to become all sorts of other haunted-house denizens as well.
<BR>
Whatever.  You can't insist on basing debate on these shifty notions that
<BR>
you present.  Earlier you seemed to present a materialistic picture of
<BR>
[human nature] as a consequence of the real world.  Now you force a
<BR>
definition upon it.  Debate on these terms will only include those who
<BR>
already agree with you.
<BR>
<P>Bah.
