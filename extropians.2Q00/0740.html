<EM>&gt; It's not really a &quot;monopoly.&quot;  The ABA does not have the exclusive right to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practice law.  The ABA in fact does not practice law.  It is merely a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; professional association of unrelated individuals who are licensed to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practice law.  It just so happens that the practice of law requires a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; license in every state in the union.  But that does not mean that lawyers 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are exercising a monopoly any more than contractors, engineers, architects 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or physicians or any other profession which you need a license in order to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legally practice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Saying that lawyers have a &quot;monopoly&quot; on the practice of law is like saying 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that licensed drivers have a monopoly on driving.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's much worse than that, though: a license to practive law requires
<BR>
the holder to do far more than merely demonstrated competence.  One must
<BR>
swear and oath to become an &quot;officer of the court&quot;--so even if you intend
<BR>
to practice law only to sue the government, you have to swear loyalty to
<BR>
your opponent--and most places _require_ you to join the &quot;private&quot; BA,
<BR>
and abide by its regulations (which does indeed make it a government-
<BR>
backed monopoly).  A defendant, who supposedly has a right to counsel
<BR>
for his defense, does not have the right to hire counsel that has not
<BR>
thus sworm loyalty to the court and to a private organization with its
<BR>
own warped sense of ethics (ethics, to the bar association, means
<BR>
making sure the right pockets get lined).
<BR>
<P>Thre is also no doubt what the bar associations really exist for: they
<BR>
serve no purpose but maintaining a stranglehold on the market.  The Texas
<BR>
Bar, for example, abandoned all pretense of integrity by suing Nolo Press
<BR>
for publishing books about law.  Free speech be damned, the people's
<BR>
right to know the law they pay for be damned, the Texas Bar saw them as
<BR>
a threat to their wallets and took action.
<BR>
<P>Public perception of lawyers is sometimes well-deserved.
