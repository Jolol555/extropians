The Amish have been a theme running through a bunch of recent
<BR>
messages.  I'm moved to mention a few of the visions that thinking
<BR>
about the future of the Amish gives me.
<BR>
<P>1) The Amish slowy evaporate ala the Shakers because they lose
<BR>
critical mass.   Doesn't seem to be happening at the moment, which is
<BR>
pretty cool.  I know the Shakers (no sex) are a bad example on the
<BR>
continuity side.
<BR>
<P>2) The Amish disappear because their way of life becomes economically
<BR>
unsustainable.  Any number of reasons present themselves, such as:
<BR>
&nbsp;o No market for their products
<BR>
&nbsp;o No remaining sources for the tech that they need
<BR>
&nbsp;o Can't expand to support population growth because the rest of the
<BR>
galaxy has been converted to computronium.....
<BR>
<P>3) The Amish are uploaded into an emulated farming environment, maybe
<BR>
their own planet.   I think that this would be against their
<BR>
teachings and the uploaded Amish might suffer the critical mass
<BR>
problem because the meme system had been broken.  Still, it's a great
<BR>
idea for something like one of John Varley's disneylands in a domed
<BR>
lunar crater.  Heck, that would be real farming, maybe some young
<BR>
Amish would go for it!
<BR>
<P>4) The Amish are uploaded without their knowledge.
<BR>
<P>If I ever write a post-singularity novel, my evil bad-guy is going
<BR>
to have an emulated planet of  kidnap-uploaded Amish, the way that
<BR>
Blofeld had his cats or someone else might keep a fishtank in the
<BR>
waiting room.   One of my rare evil notions.
<BR>
