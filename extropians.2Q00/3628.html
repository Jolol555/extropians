<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Formally, I have the right to a good education, but in a tax-free,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; service-free system, I may not have the effective freedom to have it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But by removing some of one of my freedoms (the right to choose how I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spend my money), one of my other rights is protected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You have the right to educate yourself, or to buy an education. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could volunteer to participate in the public school system, but forcing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others who choose to send their kids to private school to also pay taxes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to support you sending your kids to school is criminal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Erm, no. You may happen to think it's *wrong*, but it's not criminal. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; fact, it's currently criminal for them *not* to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Please get your terms right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There is nothing in the Constitution, federal or state (at least for NH)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that says anyone is entitled to an education. That the SCOTUS' opinion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of congressional legislation is that they are limited to those areas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enumerated by some, I do beleive we should live by the limitations of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Constitution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Excuse me, but where along the line did I give you reason to involve the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US Constitution in this? As you are well aware, I live in the UK. And if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you read back, you will notice that I was discussing *my* rights. Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when you responded you stated &quot;You have the right...&quot;, etc. I assumed you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were still discussing mine, for lack of any indication you were not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps we can resolve this before continuing.
</EM><BR>
<P>So solly. Replace 'you' with 'we' (as in us over here).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And my right to an education is secured by human rights treaties,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; including ones specific to the European Union.
</EM><BR>
<P>Does the UN Declaration of Human Rights specify a right to an education? How much
<BR>
education?
