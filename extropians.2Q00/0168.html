<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron, you're in the right place. Sometimes here on the list we're so busy 
<BR>
discussing the big ideas that little ideas can get lost, but they are totally 
<BR>
appropriate here.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Chicago this morning the Mayor is in the hospital for weekend 
<BR>
chest pain, and has already been diagnosed with hypertension.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like myself until a less than a year ago, he was a regular exerciser but 
<BR>
hadn't been to a doctor in 10 years. Now we've both learned our lesson, and 
<BR>
hopefully he'll follow my lead in going to the doctor every year. ;)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes there are everyday things we should do. Among these are a good diet, 
<BR>
regular exercise, plenty of good water and rest. I suggest adding a good 
<BR>
supplement program, and for extropians over 40 regular visits with a good 
<BR>
doctor.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it helps to share little things we've each learned. Like most 
<BR>
guys I like my Friday nights out, it usually boys night out so we used to go 
<BR>
out and paint the town red, on Sat anyone who wasn't married usually went out 
<BR>
and gave it a second coat.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike most guys, about a year and a half ago I started taking an aspirin 
<BR>
a day as a preventive protocol for my heart. Less than a year latter I 
<BR>
started having stomach problems which I attributed to too many nights out 
<BR>
with the guys, so I started cutting back. Still had problems and they started 
<BR>
getting worse. So I finally went to the doctor when the heart attack like 
<BR>
symptoms started and got acquainted with prilosec instead.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out we've now learned that drinking alcohol (even occasionally) 
<BR>
while taking aspirin can cause an exponential increase in gastic problems. 
<BR>
This started turning up after lots of us early adopters started getting sick. 
<BR>
So if you like your suds, don't take aspirin (or tylenol).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gave me a great excuse to up and plain quit.  I still go out with the 
<BR>
gang, and we all benefit cause we have a built in DD these days.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an Investingnode available here to members of the extropy 
<BR>
institute, so I would recommend becoming a member if your budget will allow. 
<BR>
It is fairly low traffic, but has an extremely high S/N ratio.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel free to bring up what ever you like.

<BR>
Brian,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much for your kind words.  In the interest of brevity I 
<BR>
did a little editing on your email after copying it to this response.  All of 
<BR>
my email, that you had quoted is cut.  Anyone interested is invited to refer 
<BR>
to the originals.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, my basic interests have to do with a question: In the short 
<BR>
run what items should be on our planning and action agenda?  I think it was 
<BR>
MS More that did a beautiful job of laying out a short term agenda for us; 
<BR>
however, like all such agendas it gets over run by time and in addition is 
<BR>
not the preferred agenda of everyone.  I think the poetic way to get to my 
<BR>
meaning is to say that her article, in my mind, is more a living document 
<BR>
than a message written on two tablets of stone. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have coined a short slogan laying out my personal answer:
<BR>
Live long, get smart, stay cute.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry you found out the hard way that suds and aspirin don't mix.  I 
<BR>
use Enteric aspirin but forego the suds.  My friend Bill Wilson says no suds 
<BR>
for me.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But back to the general discussion.  If in the short run we take as a 
<BR>
planning and action item to &quot;live long&quot; there seems to be two truths that are 
<BR>
apparent:
<BR>
First:  That a great deal of work has been done recently and is still being 
<BR>
done.  Roy Walford, Ronald M. Klatz, Dr. Atkins and Real Age come immediately 
<BR>
to mind.  No doubt there are others, and perhaps more knowledgeable, that I 
<BR>
have never heard of.
<BR>
Second:  That it appears we have enough to go immediately to work and extend 
<BR>
our lives but that our big problem is going to be to assimilate all the 
<BR>
information and turn it into a workable program.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the second phrase in my slogan, I think the power to survive 
<BR>
will always be a mainly a matter of our knowledge and motivation.  If you 
<BR>
allow me to include the amassing of enough wealth to accomplish our goals as 
<BR>
part of my private definition of &quot;getting smart&quot;  then in what subjects 
<BR>
academic and practical should we be educating ourselves?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, &quot;stay cute.&quot;  I think there is a lighter side to life; a side 
<BR>
that involves having fun, loving and mixing with the society around us; maybe 
<BR>
even eventually catching a spaceship and doing a little traveling.  How do we 
<BR>
become and remain active involved people?  I don't think any of us wants to 
<BR>
be the oldest living human being and strapped to a bed in a nursing home 
<BR>
unable to even stand alone.  What can we do in this area?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian, this email is far too long.  I would love to hear your ideas as 
<BR>
well as the ideas of anyone else that is thinking along these lines.
<BR>
Ron Harrison
