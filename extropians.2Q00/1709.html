I think that we transhumanists will make a difference, in formulating the 
<BR>
political thoughts for this century that can apply themselves to the new 
<BR>
technologies and to a constant dynamism in society.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>This is the key point!  In football(American) terms, we are the defensive 
<BR>
line that tries to give the quarterback space to move, and time to launch 
<BR>
the ball before he gets sacked.  Now, if only we had half the budget of 
<BR>
simply one football team frachise!!  Hey, how about the &quot;Anchorage 
<BR>
Automorphs&quot; playing against the L.A. Raiders!  If only I were a 
<BR>
multi-billionaire!  Being a multi-millioniare just does not do it anymore...
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
I'm not saying this to discourage those of you out there that are already 
<BR>
working in these sectors (keep it up BTW), but to point out that we 
<BR>
transhumanists really have to be &quot;the friends of the future&quot;, contructing a 
<BR>
philosophy and a cultural movement that can oppose the onslaught of stasist 
<BR>
forces. What good does it do to research when you´re opposed at every step?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>And that is where the Extropian Institute comes in.  Max, Natasha, Robert 
<BR>
and others with relatively little money have gone out and made some big 
<BR>
splashes in the mass media.  They have the persona and knowledge to get this 
<BR>
done.  Natasha even has a cable access show(Wayne's World! Wayne's World!, 
<BR>
sorry...) that discusses every week transhuman topics.  It is sad that to my 
<BR>
knowledge it is just shown around the L.A. area.  Someone big needs to pick 
<BR>
it up.
<BR>
<P>And the Extro's get the attention of the scientific community to the point 
<BR>
that many prominent scientists actually come and speak!  The Extro is the 
<BR>
ideal opportunity to get the word out to the world, and to &quot;rally round the 
<BR>
flag!&quot;

but as I said, the benefactors must consider the work to be in their own 
<BR>
interest. And enthusiasm alone isn't necessarily enough. Funding has a

greater chance of coming when someone has something to fund.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Very true.  But as Waldemar stated there are list members who are going 
<BR>
forward with their own personal projects and businesses.  Sasha Chislanko is 
<BR>
in a position of power to fund promising startups but it has to be very 
<BR>
promising I bet before the firm he works for will actually do it!
<BR>
<P>Though Max and Natasha have moved forward the extropian agenda without alot 
<BR>
of money to draw from, I am sure they would like a multi-million dollar 
<BR>
budget to really champion the cause.  Perhaps oneday, one of us will have 
<BR>
the resources to be a patron and really put the Extropian Institute and 
<BR>
transhumanism on the map in a BIG way.
<BR>
