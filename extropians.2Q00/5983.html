<P>What a perfect Catch-22!  A bunch of Jews can call you anti-semitic, and if
<BR>
you say &quot;Hey, a bunch of Jews are wrongly calling me anti-semitic,&quot; you're
<BR>
thereby anti-semitic.
<BR>
<P>IMHO, classifying people by something they're opposed to, is pretty bad
<BR>
reasoning.  There are many ways to dislike Jewish religion or culture, and
<BR>
to imply that they're all evil is either flippant or pretty damn arrogant.
<BR>
We might just as well talk about anti-Arabs, a &quot;concept&quot; which would
<BR>
associate neo-Nazis with a lot of Jews.
