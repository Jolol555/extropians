<EM>&gt;Telomere length is fundamentally an anti-cancer control mechanism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When you see someone discussing telomere length in whales and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;elephants, that will be something to write about (since it may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;answer the question of whether they have similar anti-cancer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;programs or different programs that we can steal).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Even when we fully understand telomeres and telomerase, and how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to regulate them, that will not be a &quot;magic bullet&quot; for aging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;since it does not solve the problems of aging in non-dividing cells,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cell loss with age, accumulated DNA damage, etc, etc.
</EM><BR>

<P>Ah, curious as to when it was realized - the link between telomeres and 
<BR>
cancer??  I figured it out in 1980 at the Life Extension conference held at 
<BR>
the Disneyland Hotel, as I best recall.  A Chinese-American researcher had 
<BR>
discovered that Cancer cells were not subject to the Hayflick limit.  The 
<BR>
instant I heard that, my next thought was - &quot;Oh, so the Hayflick limit is 
<BR>
the natural control of cancer.  That's why children's cancers are so 
<BR>
deadly.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, like W. Donner Denkla's work, anything that purported to show 
<BR>
an aging clock was discounted by the life extension &quot;authorities&quot; of the 
<BR>
time, who had already &quot;proven&quot; that such a clock was of no use, as very few 
<BR>
animals ever reached their natural aging limit in the wild anyway.  Also, 
<BR>
they argued that selection operated solely upon individuals.  Thus, they 
<BR>
utterly failed to grasp Denkla's arguments.
<BR>
<P>Rather that simply railing against the closed-mindedness of people who are 
<BR>
mostly very old or dead now, I bring this up to make a point.  The key 
<BR>
element missing in the catalog of mental operations of most of the older 
<BR>
generation - those now older than 60 - was the ability to think in terms of 
<BR>
systems - complex feedback and control mechanisms.
<BR>
<P>Taking a page from Papert's Mindstorms, those of us who were lucky enough to 
<BR>
work with real models of such - mainly computers - have no trouble at all 
<BR>
thinking in terms of systemic variables, but face a frustrating blank wall 
<BR>
of uncomprehension in trying to convey our insights to those who have no 
<BR>
such concrete, experiential models in their minds.
<BR>
<P>Certain questions naturally follow:  What are we missing that the next 
<BR>
generation can see naturally?  How much will this blindness damage our 
<BR>
efforts as extropians?  How can we prevent or offset this kind of problem?  
<BR>
I suspect that aging research lost a decade or two due to the failure to 
<BR>
look seriously enough at the aging clock issue.  A lot of us will not make 
<BR>
it because of that loss.
