<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Species that do not have long lifespans, such as mice, and farm

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;animals (bred for fast growth and other qualities, not longevity)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;are likely to have different controls on teleomere length and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;the length will have different effects vis-a-vis aging.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Why? I've read lots of theories claiming telomeres in mice are differently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; regulated than in humans (which appears to be likely) but I'm ignorant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; regarding cows' telomeres. You just base your opinion on the fact that cows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; live less than us or do you know something I don't?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To start with mice have longer telomeres than humans.  So their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shortening with cell division presumably does not impact much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on their rate of aging.  The longer telomeres *may* explain why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they get cancer after only 2-3 years with many fewer cell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; divisions (lower mass).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The original &quot;proto-cell&quot; had to have telomerase on (at some point)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to keep the telomeres intact from generation to generation.  The original
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proto-mammals it is believed were small (more like mice), so they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably had short lifespans (almost all small animals do) and like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mice had little need for anti-cancer programs.  Depending on the size
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and longevity of the mammal that was the common ancestor of cows, sheep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and humans would determine how much of the telomere regulation program
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we share.  My suspicion would be that that ancestor would be toward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the small size for mammals, so there is likely to be a fair amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; divergence between the telomere regulation programs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since most cows and sheep are slaughtered before they get old there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be little selection for anti-cancer programs in their genomes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Probably some research would need to be done on their ancestors to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; determine what selection effects there might have been in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environments, but since they are herbivores, I suspect the carnivores
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be taking them out at the earliest sign of &quot;aging&quot; and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would seem to suggest little opportunity for anti-cancer programs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to get selected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Humans, elephants and whales on the other hand all go to the top
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of their environmental niches allowing nature to push on their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longevity to maximize reproduction.  That implies a very careful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tuning of the anti-cancer program so cancer doesn't kill you before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all of the other factors.  As Cutler, Perls, etc. have pointed out to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me, the interesting thing about the oldest-old is their ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to age &quot;uniformly&quot;.  In humans the collection of anti-aging programs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been pushed farther than most other species.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do not doubt that sheep and to a greater extent cows, may have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some telomere related anti-cancer/pro-longevity balancing occuring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I doubt it is as sophisticated as the program in the other species
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've mentioned.  We will know much more when the genomes are done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and we can compare the regulatory regions for the genes involved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in controlling telomere length.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Telomere length is fundamentally an anti-cancer control mechanism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Perhaps but I won't bet my money on it yet (and although that might be true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in humans, it's unlikely to be the case in many other species such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lobsters or even sharks).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps I should have said &quot;Telomere length in humans&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As you point out, cross-species comparisons are going to be a swamp.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sharks are a classic case (very old, very different evolutionary path)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where the anti-cancer program is likely to be very different.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Cloning experiments are useful for they contradict in many ways the theory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of DNA accumulating mutations (this particular experiment doesn't do that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because the cells were &quot;aged&quot; in vitro after being taken from a fetus but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; other experiments do just that, despite the data no being conclusive).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree.  With the cloning success rates so low, you have no idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether the failures are due to scientific methodology or whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you have a situation where only 5% of the cells contain an &quot;intact&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developmental program.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In adult organisms, there is going to be *no* selection against mutations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accumulating in the developmental genes that have already done their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; job and have been turned off.  You are only going to select for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the lack of mutations in housekeeping genes.  All the cells that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have accumulated fatal errors in their housekeeping genes have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presumably died.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The cloning experiments *may* be saying something very interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the DNA mutation theory.  The only way I can see to shed some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light on this will be when we have good DNA polymorphism chips
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that can allow you to measure the &quot;noise&quot; (mutation) level in the genome.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then you take 2000 cells, split them, measure the effective mutation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level in each &quot;clone&quot; at the same time you try to make an organism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of them.  If the mutation rate (genome noise level) is lower
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in those clones that produce successful organisms, then you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a smoking gun for the DNA mutation accumulation theory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robert
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I think it can be assumed that every living thing on the planet that is not
<BR>
a clone is a mutant.  That is to say, the rules of natural selection change
<BR>
constantly, thus from generation to generation different genetic expressions
<BR>
become more survivable.
<BR>
<P>If we cannot say &quot;there is proven telomere lengthening through this process in
<BR>
cows, thus it can be applied to humans&quot;, then it is not very long before this is
<BR>
true.  Sooner or later this or another process works on pigs or orangutans, and
<BR>
before long there will be treatments to enable cells to have a much longer
<BR>
predetermined lifespan.
<BR>
<P>As people grow older, there arise other issues that we already see today.  One
<BR>
example is cancer:  the longer the lifespan the more time is there for cells to
<BR>
turn that way.  Luckily, there are existant drugs that specifically target only
<BR>
cancerous cells for apoptosis, or cell death, thus, within ten years cancer could
<BR>
be removed from humanity.  I use the conditional &quot;could&quot; because it depends on
<BR>
these &quot;cures&quot; for cancer being allowed to be used.  Another example is that of
<BR>
degenerative nervous system diseases, which are probably the largest class after
<BR>
cancer (and preprogrammed cell multiplication related to telomerase and
<BR>
telomeres) that afflict humans as they grow older than they ever have before.
<BR>
That is another area seeing high levels of research.  There are other long-term
<BR>
aging phenomena, I am not an aging expert, and more will become apparent as
<BR>
people grow older.  There are bacterial and viral based diseases and these are
<BR>
more treatable and curable each day.
<BR>
<P>So imagine that within twenty years that some humans will be living with expected
<BR>
lifespans of twice what they are now, say 200 years.  Barring largescale
<BR>
catastrophe, by the time that span has almost passed there will be techniques to
<BR>
extend that figure to twice that again, and this continues indefinitely.
<BR>
<P>This very much brings to mind Malthusian dilemna, by the same token, these living
<BR>
people can be assumed to be productive, increasingly, throughout their long
<BR>
lifespans.
<BR>
<P>Many things will change when people start living hundreds or thousands of years.
