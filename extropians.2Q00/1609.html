<EM>&gt;     &gt;When its not foreseen (as Moore's Law helps us to do), then excessive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;productivity growth causes overcapacity, overstocked inventories
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  So, what do you do if you're making more stuff than you need? You gave the answer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself &quot;and then a slowdown in production&quot;. That's exactly what should happen,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things worked differently in the old USSR, somebody would just set manufacturing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quotas that seemed nice, the result was they'd have 10 times as much of one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; product as they needed an a tenth as much as another they needed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;and a layoff of employees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why layoff people? If I find an improved method of making fiberglass underwear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so that only a few manufacturing people can satisfy the entire world demand then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the thousands of people that had been making this wonderful product can now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make something else that we need more. Any large change in the economy or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large change in anything else for that matter, will be bad for some people, but in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general people should always make things that other people want the most,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's good for most workers and good for most consumers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;which reduces purchasing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why would purchasing decline when prices fall?
</EM><BR>
<P>John, this is what happened in the 30's. There was significant deflation, partly due
<BR>
to a tighttened money supply, and partly due to overproduction by farmers and
<BR>
manufacturers that only knew one thing: producing. When you lay people off, they don't
<BR>
have money to spend. Less money being spent means less stuff being bought. Less stuff
<BR>
being bought means lower prices and less production and more layoffs which means less
<BR>
spending, less buying, less production, more layoffs, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;if cheap and easy nuclear fusion magically became possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;today, and within a few months most everybody had a fusion plant in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;their back yard, what do you think would happen to the economy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then the current economic expansion would accelerate. Of course.
</EM><BR>
<P>All except for the millions of people who work in the energy recovery, distribution,
<BR>
and generation industries. They'd all be out of work. Since their industries make up
<BR>
some thing like 25% of our economy, at least, then you are talking about a major
<BR>
contraction, in actuality, because all those energy workers are no longer making
<BR>
money, no longer spending money on all sorts of products from the rest of the economy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;How  about if nanotech became magically possible today? I'll tell you:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;the economy would go into a major depression for a good 3-10 years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, that's a rather silly thing to say now isn't it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       &gt;You are talking about making obsolete a whole economy almost overnight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but you almost make that sound like a bad thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not in the long run, no, but making a whole economy obsolete overnight, or almost
<BR>
overnight will cause a) people to not invest in anything, because they can't be sure
<BR>
if it will be viable or dead 6 months down the road, b) massive sell offs in all
<BR>
markets, with crashing prices, and concurrent evaporation of a majority of the wealth
<BR>
in the world. Just as was seen with the meltdown in Asia a short while ago, when the
<BR>
markets crash like that, industries that are leveraged need instant liquidity to pay
<BR>
expenses, while banks are calling in loans by the bucketload, which the debtors
<BR>
obviously don't have the liquidity to cover, so you wind up with a massive banking
<BR>
failure. Banking failures cause banks to freeze assets, which also decreases
<BR>
individual consumers' ability to spend money, and to refund deposits for pennies on
<BR>
the dollar, which also has a rather disincentive effect on consumer spending.
<BR>
<P>Once the herd has started to stampede, its hard to stop until people are jumping from
<BR>
buildings. As I stated previously, knowledge helps alleviate this vicious panic cycle.
<BR>
Knowledge of Moore's Law has been of immeasurable benefit in allowing industries to
<BR>
manage the increase in productivity and the decrease in prices. Note how the average
<BR>
desktop PC is not much cheaper than it was 8 years ago, but it has a WHOLE lot more
<BR>
features. If a manufacturer didn't know about how Moore's Law can be used to manage
<BR>
change profitably, you'd see some dumb manufacturer still making 286 PC's for $1500.00
<BR>
and wondering why he's bankrupt and not selling anything. He drops his price down to
<BR>
$50.00, and he can sell some units at that price, but it costs hime $400 to make those
<BR>
$50 PC's so he's still going out of business.
<BR>
<P>If we could build this sort of productivity gain into car manufacture, we'd all be
<BR>
flying supersonic aircars by now, and paying the same amount for a car we were paying
<BR>
in 1980. If you magically introduced one of these aircars for a price of about $20,000
<BR>
today, with a production capacity of a million units a year, GM, Ford, Toyota, Daimler
<BR>
Chrysler, et al would all be declaring bankruptcy in short order, and you'd have
<BR>
millions of unionized autoworkers out on the streets unemployed. Markets would crash
<BR>
(all except your AirCar, Inc. stock), wealth would evaporate, consumer spending would
<BR>
decrease (all those autoworkers unemployed), and you'd get the vicious cycle I
<BR>
described earlier. Those other companies could try to introduce similar products, but
<BR>
they can't compete being saddled by all those union labor costs, by their outmoded
<BR>
factories, and their lack of automation.
<BR>
<P>Are you starting to see what I am getting at?
