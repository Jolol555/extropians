<P><EM>&gt; These are deliberate back-doors put in the e-mail software to allow outside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  people to execute commands on your PC.  Microsoft insists on keeping these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  backdoors, because they use them for their own purposes.  They also refuse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to add security so that they can only be used by Microsoft.  As a result,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  these backdoors are not only known to exist, but they are documented and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  advertised in Microsoft manuals on how to send executable scripts that run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  on other people's computer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  This is not a simple lack of infallibility.  This is sheer stupidity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Microsoft is deliberately and knowingly keeping these backdoors open 
</EM><BR>
because
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  the Microsoft thinks that its desire to send commands to your computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  easily outweighs your desire to not allow hackers to send commands to your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  computer easily.  Security professionals have asked Microsoft to fix these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  backdoors, and Microsoft claims that it would not be in their best interest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to do so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvey, I'm not aware of any such backdoors, but I don't doubt their 
<BR>
existance for one minute. Do you have any links to material about them ?. 
<BR>
Security is one of my greatest concerns and I always feel like im not playing 
<BR>
on a level pitch. With MS, hackers and ignorant managers I sometimes feel &quot;if 
<BR>
you cant beat em...&quot; . Good job I have scruples.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex.
