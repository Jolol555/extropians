</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the idea that God played dice with the universe figured there must be a hidden
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; variable inside the photon that told it what to do. By &quot;hidden variable&quot; they meant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something different about that particular photon that we just don't know about.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They meant something equivalent to a lookup table inside the photon that for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one reason or another we are unable to access but the photon can when it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wants to know if it should go through a filter or be stopped by one.
</EM><BR>
<P>You mean like which way the photon is polarized?  (It is undetermined,
<BR>
so it is unknown.  This seems to fit, since this would determine whether
<BR>
it makes it through a polarizing filter.)

<P><EM>&gt; I have a black box, it has a red light and a blue light on it, it also has a rotary switch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with 6 connections at the 12,2,4,6,8 and 10 o'clock positions. The red and blue light
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blink in a manner that passes all known tests for being completely random, this is true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regardless of what position the rotary switch is in. Such a box could be made and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still be completely deterministic by just pre-computing 6 different random sequences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and recording them as a lookup table in the box. Now the box would know which light to flash.
</EM><BR>
<P>Umm...possible error here.  Unless the sequences are of infinite
<BR>
length (which can't be precomputed, since it would take an infinite
<BR>
amount of time), then the sequences are of finite length, so if you
<BR>
observe it long enough, the algorithm can be observed as &quot;repeat this
<BR>
sequence if the switch is as position X&quot;.  (Or, &quot;repeat this sequence,
<BR>
starting at position Y...&quot;, or whatever algorithmic enhancements one
<BR>
makes to obfuscate it.  It might not be easy, but it would be possible
<BR>
given enough observations.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A correlation greater that 2/3, such as 3/4, for adjacent settings produces paradoxes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least it would if you expected everything to work mechanistically because of some hidden
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; variable involved. Does this mean it's impossible to make two boxes that have those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specifications? Nope, but it does mean hidden variables can not be involved and that means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something very weird is going on. Actually it would be quite easy to make a couple of boxes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that behave like that, it's just not easy to understand how that could be.
</EM><BR>
<P>Another possible error: what if you had 4 boxes, one set to 12 o'clock,
<BR>
one set to 2 o'clock, one set to 4 o'clock, and one set to 6 o'clock.
<BR>
By your logic, 12 has 1/4 difference from 2 has 1/4 difference from 4
<BR>
has 1/4 difference from 6, and yet 12 has 4/4, not 3/4, difference from 6
<BR>
at the same time.  You could have &quot;6 is 1/4 different from 4 if the
<BR>
other box is set to 4, but 4/4 different from 12 if the other box is set
<BR>
to 12&quot;, but how can you enforce 1/4 and 4/4 difference in the same run
<BR>
as given above?
<BR>
<P>I get the feeling I'm missing something here...
