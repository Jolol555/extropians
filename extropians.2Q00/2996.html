<P><EM>&gt; The fact that the US is one of the biggest emigre destinations on the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  planet, I think, says a lot about who (as between Lorrey and me) is more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  right about the nature of the US.  But, hey, in a debate as emotionally 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  charged as this one, who needs to be bogged down with something like 
</EM><BR>
factual 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;  reality? :)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mike has a heathly dose of paranioa, which is fine. As a UK 
<BR>
citizen looking to emigrate to the US I can say that personal freedom doesn't 
<BR>
really come into the equation.  Here I am under almost constant survaillance. 
<BR>
When I drive to work there are cameras that  can read my number plate and 
<BR>
store it, at work I am monitored by security cameras and likewise when I pick 
<BR>
up some shopping on the way home. my government monitors any e-mail I send 
<BR>
and my calls at work taped. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't feel in the least comprimised or feel my civil rights have been 
<BR>
infringed. This probably reflects the gradual introduction that has taken 
<BR>
place here, which has been heavily publicized in a positive light.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything, I am worried by the higher rate of crime in the US and would 
<BR>
feel safer if the level of survaillance was as great there as here. It looks 
<BR>
like the British Government has done a very good spin job on this subject as 
<BR>
it isn't an issue that the public are concerned about.
