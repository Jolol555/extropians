<EM>&gt;                 Is Fairness About Clear Fitness Signals?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ordinary intuitions about &quot;fairness&quot; may be less than commonly assumed about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equal outcomes, and more about how well success correlates with genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fitness.  It can thus seem fair that the most attractive witty athletic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks to get more mates and money, but seem unfair that the rich can buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better education for their children.  Makeup can seem fair, while breast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implants seem unfair.  This theory has implications for what kinds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; redistribution and genetic policies will seem fair.
</EM><BR>
<P>The interesting thing about Robin's ideas in this area is not only that
<BR>
they are counter-intuitive, but that they challenge our ideas about how
<BR>
our minds work and what our motivations are.
<BR>
<P>Robin suggests, if I understand him, that our actual motivations for
<BR>
our beliefs are not really what we normally think.  In the paper above,
<BR>
he focuses on the idea of fairness, especially in terms of how fair it
<BR>
is for people to have certain privileges such as fame and fortune.  We
<BR>
often tell ourselves that our opinions on these matters are based on
<BR>
compassion, or a sense of justice, or perhaps based on logic.
<BR>
<P>But in fact Robin proposes that our values in this regard are in some
<BR>
sense hard-wired into us by thousands of generations of evolution.
<BR>
We are born with these feelings, because our ancestors who had these
<BR>
kinds of feelings were more reproductively successful.  Our various
<BR>
justifications and explanations come after the fact.  They are, in fact,
<BR>
rationalizations which have no true explanatory power.  You might even
<BR>
say we are lying to ourselves.
<BR>
<P>This perspective is even more pointed with regard to the health care
<BR>
issues that Robin discusses in <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf</A>.
<BR>
Robin gives a technical account of why we feel so strongly that health
<BR>
care ought to be provided in a nondiscriminatory fashion, and why it
<BR>
strikes us as so much more unfair when poor people get bad health care,
<BR>
than when they have inferior qualities of other goods and services.
<BR>
<P>To drastically oversimplify, Robin's model suggests that we want the
<BR>
poor and disadvantaged to spend more on health care, because that will
<BR>
increase the chance that they may be useful to us someday.  What seems
<BR>
to us to be purely an act of unselfish caring is transformed, in this
<BR>
model, into cold calculation of personal advantage.
<BR>
<P>And again, the idea is that these calculations are built into us by
<BR>
evolution, so that they happen on an unconscious level.  We experience
<BR>
feelings of concern when we see a disadvantaged person suffering poor
<BR>
health.  We don't realize that the reason is due to these evolutionary
<BR>
factors.  And so we rationalize, we say that the reason is because we
<BR>
are kind and generous, and we are saddened by human suffering.
<BR>
<P>These explanations are misleading because they suggest that we first
<BR>
have the reasoned feeling of kindness, and then we apply it to the
<BR>
particular case of poor health care, when in fact Robin suggests that
<BR>
things go the other way around.  And he has a great many examples in
<BR>
which the rationalized explanation doesn't work very well, while his
<BR>
theory fits the facts.
<BR>
<P>This provides an additional burden in becoming convinced about these
<BR>
theories.  We don't like to think that we are lying to ourselves,
<BR>
that our unselfish &quot;good&quot; feelings are actually derived from selfish
<BR>
&quot;evil&quot; ones.  (Ayn Rand fans don't count.)  Of course we all understand
<BR>
that in a trivial, tautological sense, we do what we do because that
<BR>
is what gives us pleasure (by definition).  But it is disconcerting to
<BR>
learn that what we thought of as noble impulses actually derive from
<BR>
the basest calculations of self-interest, built into us over the years.
