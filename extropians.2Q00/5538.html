<EM>&gt; &gt; The problem arises with assumption of the One True Religion which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; does not exist. Atheism, on the other hand, has the equally silly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; claim that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; since none of them is the One True Religion, then none of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are True.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've seen Atheism practiced with the same intolerant zeal as Christianity or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Scientology.  But the Atheists aren't trying to save souls or to clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engrams.  What, then, would their motive be?
</EM><BR>
<P>Um, to keep the stores open on Sunday so I can shop?
