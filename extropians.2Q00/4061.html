<EM>&gt;Minsky was on PBS recently - a panel on the future of the internet, as I

<EM>&gt;recall.  He now puts the Singularity - as far as real AI - at about 2073, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to my surprise.

<P>That is a pretty specific date; did he mention how he calculated it?

<P>On the conference, I enjoyed my time there, but there were so many
<BR>
parallel tracks that I can't claim my experience was representative.
<BR>
I did two economics sessions, one on singularity economics and another
<BR>
on nano-economics, and spend the rest of my formal time at an
<BR>
idea futures section.  As usual, I most enjoyed just talking to people
<BR>
informally outside the formal sessions.
<BR>
<P>I wonder what would happen if you organized a &quot;party/poster&quot; conference
<BR>
by just having a very large room with dozens of whiteboards, and with
<BR>
snacks and chairs distributed throughout.  There would be no official
<BR>
schedule or map, and you'd spend the whole weekend wandering about joining
<BR>
whatever discussions or presentations formed &quot;spontaneously.&quot;  Any dispute
<BR>
about what a group talked about in a location would be handled as at a
<BR>
party, with the option of one group walking away to do what they want
<BR>
somewhere else.
