<P>This really naive. Again, 'things will sort themselves out&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>It's not the only alternative to starvation is it? Crime pays way better. 
<BR>
Don't kid yourself that MacDonalds will suddenly be better stocked with 
<BR>
uneducated unskilled able-bodied humans. (Someone, maybe you, pointed out 
<BR>
that in the US anyone able-bodied can already get a job in janitorial or fast 
<BR>
food there's an abundance of socially demeaning shitjobs at below poverty 
<BR>
level wages.)
<BR>
<P>Then you also insist the government shouldn't supply education, and impose 
<BR>
guidelines for minimum wages, or support job training (with our taxes) -- 
<BR>
count on even less incentive to work and much more incentive to rob liquor 
<BR>
stores or run drugs.
<BR>
<P>reality.
