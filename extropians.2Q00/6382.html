<P>!Zowwwie!! That's it! 
<BR>
<P>Okay, here's the problem with Transhumanism/Extropianism: we're never
<BR>
going to be a mass movement. We're never going to be populists.  Jane
<BR>
Bluecollar isn't going to vote for a candidate from the Extropian Party
<BR>
or view a webcast of Extro 10 or join the Institute. Why? Not because
<BR>
we're all elitists, and we don't want her around. Simply because a lot
<BR>
of the stuff we're talking about isn't very accessible, and doesn't
<BR>
make an impact in people's live here and now. Yes, it may make an
<BR>
impact on their lives five or ten years from now, but you can't eat
<BR>
that, and you can't use that to pay the rent.
<BR>
<P>Up till now, I've been quietly assuming that the best we can hope for
<BR>
is to slowly influence the ideas of media, corporate, and government 
<BR>
leaders who hail from more broad-based movements and do have populist
<BR>
credibility. To an extent this has been happening-- probably mostly due
<BR>
to a tech-driven economic boom, but we may have played some small part
<BR>
in that as well.
<BR>
<P>This thread, however, points the way to a new path. What if we incorporate
<BR>
appropriate, affordable technology into our agenda? The social problem of
<BR>
the future will be lack of access to information and technology. Duh. 
<BR>
That's so obvious that the liberals have already started talking about
<BR>
it, and the conservatives will be soon to follow, so as not be left
<BR>
behind by the liberals. Yet, what do they have to offer? They don't 
<BR>
even understand the technology that the technology have-nots need 
<BR>
access to. Some of them *are* the technology have-nots and don't know it.
<BR>
<P>Now, to be clear-- I'm not talking about socialism. I'm not talking about
<BR>
lobbying for higher taxes so we can buy third world farmers 500 MHz pentia.
<BR>
I'm talking about helping people in intelligent, elegant ways. In ways that
<BR>
will make them self-sufficient. Maybe even in ways that also enrich the
<BR>
helpers.
<BR>
<P>Maybe we won't reach Jane Bluecollar in London or New York.  But this
<BR>
can be the foundation of an unlikely alliance between the resources and
<BR>
know how of the industrialized world educated elite and the poor people
<BR>
of the third world.
<BR>
<P>Specifics? Give me a break, this has just occurred to me. All I'm saying
<BR>
is, appropriate and affordable technology should be given more and more
<BR>
attention in our discussions. It's as important as AI, genomics, and 
<BR>
all that other good stuff. 
<BR>
<P>For the altruists out there-- we can help the needy in ways that few
<BR>
others have the expertise or imagination to do. I probably already had
<BR>
you from the second paragraph onward, so I'll stop preaching to the 
<BR>
choir. 
<BR>
<P>For the egoists out there-- a world of tech savvy, tech-heeled people
<BR>
will be more receptive to our ideas, especially if we're the ones who
<BR>
helped them get that way. The West is spoiled. You want to see a place
<BR>
where they love technology? Look to a place where they don't have
<BR>
enough of it. Besides, this will also really confuse the liberals--
<BR>
&quot;What? Those Techno-Libertarians are *helping* people? How low can
<BR>
they sink?&quot;
