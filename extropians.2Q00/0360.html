<P>&quot;Al,
<BR>
<P>please tell us your system and methods for taking care of your body and 
<BR>
extending its longevity.  It sounds like you have really worked out things 
<BR>
for yourself in this area.  I tend to fall into the trap of eating whatever 
<BR>
is put in front of me by family and friends and not getting daily exercise 
<BR>
as I should.  And these are the most basic elements of a life-extension 
<BR>
regimen.  I look forward to learning from you.  I remember a journalist 
<BR>
writing that upon visiting a group of extropians, he was surprised how one 
<BR>
of them had no problem eating a big, greasy hamburger. lol&quot;
<BR>
<P>OK! well thats quite a big subject.  I'll give an overview and then we can
<BR>
discuss various other issues in future posts.  Believe it or not, in one of
<BR>
my previous lives I was a Certified Personal Trainer for three years
<BR>
(through ACE and NASM).
<BR>
<P>ME:
<BR>
5'10&quot;/1.77m, 165 lbs/75 Kg, 8% bodyfat
<BR>
20-30min cardio training 5days/week
<BR>
30-45 min weight training 5days/week
<BR>
<P>Full vitamin supplementation:
<BR>
Great Earth brand:Multi-vitamin,mineral, anti-oxidant, C (3000mg)
<BR>
The only ones I take alot of (relative to me) is C, about 3-4g, and E, about
<BR>
1000IU
<BR>
Right now  I'm investigating replacing some C with OPC (the effective stuff
<BR>
in grape seed extract) 
<BR>
50mg DHEA - My DHEA level was low. This is a whole thread unto itself, I'm
<BR>
sure.  I had to go to a special &quot;Longevity Clinic&quot; to find a doctor who
<BR>
could comprehend the fact that I was not obviously sick, yet wanted medical
<BR>
testing/care.  At 35  (just a few months ago) I had a whole battery of blood
<BR>
tests that a &quot;normal&quot; GP doctor wouldnt think to give someone my age.  Some
<BR>
very surprising results came out of those tests! (more on this in the
<BR>
future)
<BR>
<P><P>Diet: I've always been big on nutrient density and avoiding empty calories
<BR>
even before I knew anything about them, just seemed logical to me, I guess.
<BR>
The work of Walford, and then of Parr, served to really convince me of a
<BR>
couple of basic things. 1. Eat less food than you think you need. 2. Avoid,
<BR>
as much as possible, added sugar of any kind in any food.  3.  Eat at the
<BR>
low end of the glycemic index whenever possible.
<BR>
<P>So what do I eat then?
<BR>
Chicken, turkey, fish, egg whites, cottage cheese
<BR>
LOTS of vegetables
<BR>
nuts,fruit
<BR>
1 glass red wine/day 
<BR>
<P><P>Things I rarely/never/only eat in very small quantities:
<BR>
Bread, pasta, rice, potatos (high on the glycemic index, keeps insulin
<BR>
levels too high)
<BR>
Fast food (maybe a few time a year)
<BR>
All junk food
<BR>
<P><P>So, am I missing anything here people?  I believe this to be a reasonable,
<BR>
practical, and above all sustainable plan for living long enough to benefit
<BR>
from the coming revolution in genetic therapy.  
<BR>
