<P>
Im posting this to the general list because I know a lotta
<BR>
extropians are in town and are not on exi-bay.
<BR>
<P>We are hoping to create spontaneous chaos from order
<BR>
at the Cafe Bombay, after the conference breaks up Sunday.
<BR>
We have plenty of strange attractors that will be there.  The
<BR>
place opens at 5:30 pm.  I have learned that they do not
<BR>
discriminate, they will feed anyone there, including those
<BR>
of us with wacky ideas about the future.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>The Cafe Bombay is on the south west corner of El Camino
<BR>
and San Antonio road in Palo Alto just behind the Bank of
<BR>
Los Altos, 800 metres south of the Cabana hotel.  There is
<BR>
a buffet in addition to the menu, and there is a wide range of
<BR>
plant matter available in addition to animal corpses.  {8^D  The
<BR>
address is 4546 El Camino Real.
<BR>
<P>Fred Moulton is the organizer of it, but he will be going there
<BR>
directly from the conference, so if you think you wanna make
<BR>
that scene at 5:30, message me at <A HREF="mailto:spike66@ibm.net?Subject=Re:%20Gathering%20after%20the%20Foresight%20conference&In-Reply-To=&lt;CB95A1AEAF62D311A99400508B10DD5303FFA496@emss01m05.ems.lmco.com&gt;">spike66@ibm.net</A> or leave 
<BR>
message at 408-942-5443 so I can estimate a head count.  
<BR>
Each extropian counts only as one head, regardless of your 
<BR>
IQ or the number of computers you are wearing.  spike
