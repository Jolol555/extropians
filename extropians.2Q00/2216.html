<EM>&gt;Ok, I have a question that is leaving me confused. What exactly is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;role of compression within simulation situations? If I can represent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(i.e., model) a set of information perfectly with a compressed form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that information, then haven't I modeled something larger with something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;smaller? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For example: I can model 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 with 2 *
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;5. I've compressed a ten digit, multiple addition operation with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;single multiplication of two digits operation. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This would then seem to scale up for many things, indeed, even to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;size of the universe. Is there something I'm missing here?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>This is a really interesting question. 
<BR>
<P>On the one hand, you'd think there might be situations where a system
<BR>
emulating its own substrate could actually yield a speed increase. For
<BR>
instance, take a chip running a instruction-level simulation of
<BR>
itself. To elaborate on your example, let's say multiplication on this
<BR>
chip is very inefficient: it takes longer to multiple 5 by 6 than it
<BR>
does to do 5 adds. If I simulate multiplication by doing additions,
<BR>
then I'd get a speed increase. 
<BR>
<P>But this is a one time optimization: If the emulator runs another
<BR>
layer of simulation, I won't get the same increase. And I only get a
<BR>
speed up on programs using the multiplication instruction - so I don't
<BR>
have a faster chip, that is a chip that runs every program faster than
<BR>
the substrate, I only have a chip than runs a subset of programs
<BR>
faster. You always have to bottom out somewhere.
<BR>
<P>There's an analogy here to data compression: There exists no algorithm
<BR>
which can be guaranteed to shave a bit off any arbitrary bit string. If
<BR>
there were, applying the algorithm enough times would compress
<BR>
anything down to zero. All you can do is map frequently occurring
<BR>
patterns down to short encodings at the expense of making less
<BR>
frequent patterns more expensive to express.
