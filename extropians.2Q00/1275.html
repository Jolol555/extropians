a) there is no 'thrill' or 'rush' from packing heat. Anyone who does so for 
<BR>
that purpose or to get the chance to use it on somebody shouldn't be 
<BR>
carrying, or should really reexamine why they are carrying. This is the 
<BR>
typical response of the hoplophobes, that people who carry are a bunch of 
<BR>
bloodthirsty sadists that wanna go out and kick ass. This couldn't be 
<BR>
further from the truth.

<BR>
<P>I beg to differ from personal experience.  I have known a few people who 
<BR>
carried concealed weapons legally after having gotten a permit, and while 
<BR>
definitely not looking to blow someone away, did get a certain 'rush' from 
<BR>
it, and had a 'try to mess with me now, scumbags!' attitude that they shared 
<BR>
with me in private.
<BR>
<P>Fortunately, they had gone through a class that taught them well to think 
<BR>
twice before pulling the gun out.  The full ramifications had been explained 
<BR>
in detail.  And they were basically sound individuals who just did not want 
<BR>
to be threatened by punks.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
b) in a society where everyone took such responsibility for themselves, you 
<BR>
wouldn't need to go at it alone. There would be a good couple dozen other 
<BR>
responsible citizens right there along with you. In such a society, there 
<BR>
would be no such thing as a 'dangerous area'.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Mike, remember the wild west??  Even if everyone carried today, there would 
<BR>
certainly still be dangerous areas because of the nature of the local 
<BR>
populations and the gangs there!  But if you went there with your 'posse' of 
<BR>
friends and not alone you would have a decent chance of surviving because 
<BR>
the 'bad guys' would not want to risk their lives with such odds.
