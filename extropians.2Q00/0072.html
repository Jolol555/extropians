<EM>&gt; &gt; I would say it would be a good idea for those that carry guns for government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; carry recording devices that were both required to be on when on duty,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It would be easy with current technology to make gun-cams for all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cops, that starts recording the second the weapon is withdrawn from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the holster.  Would *anyone* object to such a thing?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't. Considering how much more likely a cop is to kill an
<BR>
innocent person than a gun carrying civilian at a crime scene, it would
<BR>
definitely help prevent cover-ups as well as contribute to better on the
<BR>
job training using the video footage in 'hogans alley' type shooting
<BR>
training. 
<BR>
<P>However, I'd recommend that the cameras be turned on in any of the
<BR>
following circumstances:
<BR>
a) whenever the cop wants to turn it on
<BR>
b) whenever his heart rate/bp rise above a certain level
<BR>
c) whenever the dispatcher remotely activates it
<BR>
d) whenever the vehicle siren is activated
<BR>
<P>THe camera could only be turned off under the following conditions:
<BR>
a) the cops heart rate/bp drops below a certain level
<BR>
b) the dispatcher or others at the precinct deactivate it
<BR>
c) the vehicle sirens and/or lights are turned off
<BR>
d) there are no prisoners held in the vehicle
<BR>
<P>By the time a situation has deteriorated to the point where a cop needs
<BR>
to pull out his gun, there have already been things occuring that are
<BR>
contributing to the situation and should be recorded to determine if the
<BR>
cop was correct in a feeling that the situation had escalated, and that
<BR>
he had done whatever he could prior to that to not need to pull the gun.
