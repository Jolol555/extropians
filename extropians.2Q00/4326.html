At the dinner there were by my count 49 individuals by my count ( 45 had
<BR>
the buffet,
<BR>
3 ordered off the menu, 1 did not eat).  I had called the restaurant and
<BR>
told them to 
<BR>
expect 20 to 22 individuals.  They got over twice the many, but were very
<BR>
gracious
<BR>
and as far as I know all had a good time.
<BR>
<P>I can not speak for all bay area extropians but personally a lot of my time
<BR>
and 
<BR>
energy for the past 6 months has been consumed by my job.  Leaving Sun and
<BR>
going to a startup has been a major time and energy sink.  I think that a
<BR>
lot of 
<BR>
other bay area extropians are in a similar situation.  Plus some were
<BR>
resting up
<BR>
for the Foresight conference or actually working on making it happen.
