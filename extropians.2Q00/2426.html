<EM>&gt; &gt; IMO the Open Society movement is in a phase similar to what Communism went
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; through before the Russian revolution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But the pre-commies had a choice.  I dont feel we really do,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; except perhaps to control the rate at which we go transparent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can be sure a post-singularity AI will figure out a way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to watch everyone.  {8-|
</EM><BR>
<P>Commies felt the same way. They felt, and beleived with their whole
<BR>
hearts, that the destiny of humankind was in the subservience of the
<BR>
individual to the state, the elimination of the right to property, that
<BR>
centrally planned governments and economies were the only way to
<BR>
properly run the world. How far did that get? How many people died for
<BR>
that dream? Several times more than died at the hands of the Nazis.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It is also similar to Communism in its destructive potential. Any deliberate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; attempt to create such a society is going to end up building a surveillance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; state instead.  ...   It could very easily happen here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Roger that.  Eugene, I agree that transparent society is a threat,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but that it has benefits as well.  As society becomes more transparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we must compensate by voting more libertarian governments.
</EM><BR>
<P>And how likely is that? Given the choice between anarchy and autocracy,
<BR>
the proles always choose slavery.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey thats a positive spin: currently libertarians never actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *win* elections.  If people grok that their society is going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transparent, perhaps we may shock ourselves and win a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few elections.  Truth is, even the most law-abiding among
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us occasionally do things we dont want the law man to know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Once the people grok that the intentions of government are to oversee
<BR>
their very bedrooms, then they will revolt. Unfortunately, but the time
<BR>
they notice this, it will be far too late to do much good. The autocrats
<BR>
are using the principle of the steamed lobster to enslave us without our
<BR>
noticing. Start a lobster in cool water, and slowly turn up the heat.
<BR>
The lobster is cold blooded. By the time it gets to the point of
<BR>
objecting to the heat, it is far too late to do anything about it.
