<P>Actually I do too.  Self delusion is practically inevitable when one
<BR>
has a self.  A very a good question was asked by Pilate in the book
<BR>
of John 18:38, &quot;What is truth?&quot;
<BR>
<P>My answer: hellll if I know.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That being said, I must confess that we, too, can fool ourselves into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believing that uploading, or resuscitation from cryonic storage, or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; singularity, etc. will happen soon enough for us all.
</EM><BR>
<P>I dont understand.  Resuscitation from cryonic storage stage has
<BR>
no time limit that I know of, and the tech to freeze and store is with
<BR>
us already.  The singularity, on the other hand, is likely going to happen
<BR>
all too soon.  {8-|  I havent decided if that is a good thing or a bad
<BR>
thing.  {8-|
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (But there could still be hope! After all, Tipler could be right and we'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all be resurrected as immortal emulations at the Omega Point.
</EM><BR>
<P>Tipler's notion is completely additive: if other immortality bids fail,
<BR>
his idea might still somehow come thru for us.  I estimate cryonics
<BR>
gives you about a 10% chance of resurrection, Tipler adds another
<BR>
1% or so, Singularity deciding it likes you: 5%, nanotech/uploading
<BR>
about 20%, all other notions including traditional religion, negligible.
<BR>
So the good news is we have better than a one in three chance of
<BR>
indefinite survival, and yes I acknowledge the possiblity I am fooling
<BR>
myself.  {8^D  spike
