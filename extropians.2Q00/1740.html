<EM>&gt;     &gt; union workers as in a) high salary for low skill work, b) lots of convoluted, expensive,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;and time  wasting work rules,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If your opinion of unions is that low then why are you worried that technology will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; render them obsolete; or are you just a fan of incompetence and red tape?
</EM><BR>
<P>Whe a union has a stranglehold on the current industry dominators, that
<BR>
causes a significant barrier to the entry of new technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; the turmoil of crashing markets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oil markets will crash, fusion markets will not.
</EM><BR>
<P>And if fusion markets employ fewer people than the oil markets, you'll
<BR>
have a period of high unemployment. When the oil markets crash, the 
<BR>
wealth of those invested in oil technologies will evaporate overnight,
<BR>
reducing the amount of capital on the markets that is available to
<BR>
invest in new fusion manufacturing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;will cause large amounts of capital to evaporate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So if an airline, for example, found its fuel bill was now zero that would cause
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; financial difficulty for the company and it would no longer be able to finance expansion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does that sound right to you?
</EM><BR>
<P>Oil companies will not be able to afford to distribute oil that is worth
<BR>
less than the cost of distribution and refinement, so the airlines will
<BR>
not even be able to get their hands on enough fuel...for a short period
<BR>
of time. It will sort itself out in a while. In the meantime, nobody is
<BR>
flying.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;Actually, stealth technology *is* being used commercially, even down to the point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;where you can buy a bra for your car made of stealth material to help protect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;yourself against radar speed traps.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And if a stealth bra is not worth a few hundred billion dollars what is? Your tax dollars
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at work. What's next, Tang and non stick frying pans?
</EM><BR>
<P>Mock all of these consumer products if you want John. You are getting
<BR>
really obviously stubborn about winning your argument.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;I don't know the cost of a B-1 bomber (which is not a stealth bomber)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True, I meant to say a B2 bomber
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;but the B-2 bomber  (which is a stealth bomber) costs around $800 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The cost per airplane is about 2 billion, but the military can get very creative with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their accounting when they want good PR, you could probably get a $800 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figure if you ignored the huge R&amp;D bill (mostly D), but as there are no plans to build
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any more of these white elephants that doesn't seem like good accounting practice to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know where you are getting this figure, as the $800 million
<BR>
figure was one calculated by the opponents of the B-2 to make it look as
<BR>
expensive as possible (even though that figure includes lots of stuff
<BR>
other than just the airplane). I imagine you are cooking this up in
<BR>
order to win the argument, as you seem to be acting very stubbornly
<BR>
obtuse in this thread.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;A B-2 bomber weighs  over 400,000 lb. which equals 6.4 million ounces. An ounce of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;gold goes for around $250-300, which  makes the weight of the B-2 in gold equal to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;about $1.6-1.95 billion,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sound just about right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; What it did have to do with technology and productivity is that the change in market demand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;for grain in the negative to that extent was not foreseen by the farmers, or by the bankers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;who allowed them to mortgage their farms to buy all the latest and greatest farm equipment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I've parsed that formidable sentence correctly then foreign governments stopped importing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; food and local government jacked up interest rates so high that farmers could no longer pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their bills and that's technology's fault. Huh?
</EM><BR>
<P>John, you are being WAY obtuse. I don't see how you can fail to get my
<BR>
point. Perhaps you are editing out too much of my writing in your mind
<BR>
before you read what I am saying? ;) I will make it nice and simple so
<BR>
even a child should understand this:
<BR>
<P>When industries are heavily invested in current technologies to increase
<BR>
production, and market demand suddenly drops by a large margin, you will
<BR>
wind up with many bankrupt companies (whose market value has evaporated)
<BR>
and many displaced employees. The high enemployment and the loss of
<BR>
capital value both can cause severe economic turmoil if that industry is
<BR>
a large enough sector of the economy.
<BR>
<P>If the demand for the products of that industry is being taken by a new
<BR>
industry that uses much more efficient technology to produce new, higher
<BR>
tech products at lower prices, using fewer workers, then the dislocated
<BR>
employees of the first industry will not be fully absorbed into the new
<BR>
generators of wealth. I have agreed that over the long run things sort
<BR>
themselves out and we are all for the better in the end, but in the
<BR>
short term the economy cannot take up the slack caused by these
<BR>
unforeseen paradigm changes, just as any system that has its point of
<BR>
equilibrium shifted suddenly will break up into turmoil and chaos until
<BR>
it settles into its new equilibrium point.
