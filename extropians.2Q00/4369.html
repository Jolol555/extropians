<P>
Extropes,
<BR>
<P>Check out
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/CuttingEdge/cuttingedge.html">http://abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/CuttingEdge/cuttingedge.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Robert B (as in Blunt) and Amara (the extropian dust bunny?(insert smily
<BR>
here)),
<BR>
<P>While they talk about the usual stars and galaxies, they make no mention of
<BR>
the ever elusive dark matter.  If they input data based on &quot;bright&quot; matter,
<BR>
and then run their calculations, do they get &quot;junk in gives junk out&quot;, or
<BR>
do they have an opportunity to &quot;solve for&quot; the distribution and role of
<BR>
dark matter.  
<BR>
<P>I'm still holding out for a universe jam-packed and teeming with
<BR>
post-singularity intelligence manifesting as dark matter.
<BR>
<P>Damien,
<BR>
<P>In our conversation on Bart to Berkeley, where, as above, I indicated why I
<BR>
was unimpressed by Robin's great filter premise--my view being that the
<BR>
presumption that the universe shows no signs of abundant life seems
<BR>
analogous to looking at one's immediate surroundings and supposing that
<BR>
because we can't see them--they're too small-- the billions of microbial
<BR>
particles swarming all about us don't exist.  You responded by saying that
<BR>
Kardeshev civilizations types 1,2, and 3 must evidence themselves
<BR>
unquestionably due to the altered features of the cosmos.  
<BR>
<P>On further reflection, I blundered upon a counter argument pleasantly laden
<BR>
with irony.  Mr. Kardeshev and his fans, and I count myself among them,
<BR>
must admit to developing and nurturing this K1,2,3 scenario within a K1
<BR>
pre-singularity cultural setting.  It seems to me that of all people, you,
<BR>
one of the high poobahs of the grail of singularity should have seen that,
<BR>
from this pre-singularity K.75 vantage, all bets are cancelled by that
<BR>
imminent event--The Spike, (there's a book by that title by an author whose
<BR>
name escapes me the moment)-- regarding the nature and material
<BR>
manifestation of all Kardeshev civilizations of higher &quot;K&quot; value than the
<BR>
one existing when the singularity writes the new rule book.  Thus, while
<BR>
the Kardeshev One Two Three is ambitious and pleasingly impressive, it
<BR>
cannot escape the fact of its rude origins.  It is the first attempt at a
<BR>
logical theory of the cosmic expansion of intelligence out into the
<BR>
universe, a theory put forth by terrestrial intelligence, precocious and
<BR>
full of itself, and not all that arguably, itself newly hatched and wet
<BR>
behind the ears.  The first guess is never right.  The proof of which is
<BR>
that hard on its heels it is trumped by The Spike.
<BR>
<P>Ball's in your court, Damien.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
