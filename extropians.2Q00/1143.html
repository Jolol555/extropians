<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Sounds nice.  But the minute you hold the state to the same standard as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; individuals, the state gives up all police power (except in those few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; circumstances were governmental employees or property are harmed or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; threatened) and all prisons must be emptied.  That might sound like a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thing to you, but the day it happens here is the day I move to Costa 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Rica.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Actually, this is not true. The only greater authority police have that you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't have is the ability to give traffic tickets, and in some states, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arrest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for misdemeanor offenses. We are all authorized and responsible to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;apprehend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;criminals committing felonies, and in the face of threat of deadly force, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unarmed individuals present, lethal force is generally legal, though there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;differing thresholds.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well yes, and no.  In California if you're not a cop, you'd better be *darn* 
<BR>
sure that the suspect is guilty, especially if you resort to deadly force, 
<BR>
because if the suspect you shoot is not actually guilty of a felony you are 
<BR>
up a creek.  Even if you use non-deadly force you had better be sure that a 
<BR>
crime has in fact been committed and you had better have &quot;reasonable 
<BR>
grounds&quot; to belive that the suspect you arrested is the actual perp.
<BR>
<P>Short of this, you are just opening yourself up to being sued (and possibly 
<BR>
criminally charged) for assault, battery and false imprisonment.  All in all 
<BR>
I say you're better off just calling 911.
