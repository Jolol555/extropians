<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm sure you wouldn't agree, but many people probably feel that, if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; already have a city with a high rate of crime, it makes perfect sense to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; restrict the number of people carrying loaded guns in public.  While on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; other hand, if you live in East Peapod, Wyoming, where everyone knows their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; neighbors and people feel safe enough not to lock their doors, why not let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; everyone pack if they want to?  Makes sense to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I'm sure Mike will point out as well, DC and NY have /not/ restricted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the number of people carrying weapons--they've only passed laws against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, decreasing the number of non-policemen and non-politicians carrying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weapons legally (the ruling class still has this privilege).  I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think there are any accurate stats on whether the actual number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weapons went up or down (per capita) after the laws.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are plenty of large cities where concealed carry is completely
<BR>
legal for law abiding citizens. If Zero had actually read John Lott's
<BR>
book he'd know that his statement is completely false. But then again,
<BR>
you can't confuse a gun controller with the facts. Facts are made for
<BR>
denying, obfuscating, revising, misstating. I'm sure Lott's book is one
<BR>
he'd like to burn if he had the chance.
