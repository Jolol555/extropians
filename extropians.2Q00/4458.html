From: James Rogers &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jamesr@best.com?Subject=Re:%20Living%20Below%20Your%20Means&In-Reply-To=&lt;200006061514.IAA04378@well.com&gt;">jamesr@best.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Fine dining at expensive restaurants is something that I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;minimized by eliminating all the mediocre experiences (I generally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eat at home anyway). In other words, rather than going to a &quot;very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good&quot; restaurant every two weeks, I've reduced it to going to only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the best restaurants, but only once every month or two.  I rarely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;go to restaurant twice (I am looking for a unique experience each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time), so this also allows me to be more selective in a given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;metropolitan area.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't even drink anymore, but still maintain my subscription to
<BR>
&quot;Wine Spectator&quot; magazine in addition to having excellent choices
<BR>
at home for friends. Living below your means doesn't necessarily
<BR>
mean depriving yourself, just making very smart choices, and
<BR>
eliminating excesses. Once people look seriously at their
<BR>
lifestyles, many people see changes they can make.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;If I optimized my life for maximal pleasure, I am quite certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that I could live on an order of magnitude less money than I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;currently earn.  The downside is that doing so would create an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unnecessary resource limitation. In fact, what you are describing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is a resource stasis of sorts.  My interest in money is only to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the extent that I can fund cool projects that interest me in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future.  I view simple living largely as a way to promote wealth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and well-being -- a means rather than an end.  My curiousity and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ambition would never be satisfied unless I was involved in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some type of hill-climbing behavior.  I just pick my hills more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;carefully. 
</EM><BR>
<P>To each his own.
