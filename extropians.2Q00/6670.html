<P><EM>&gt; I am playing devil's advocate here... why aren't all you non-US folk

<EM>&gt; moving here? Laying aside for the moment the INS/immigration issues-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you could move here, why not? Most people seem to believe that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have pretty much the best freedom/interesting people/cheap real estate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the boonies/cheap gas/etc. etc. Have you become too dependent on your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free medical care that you are afraid you wouldn't be able to hack it here?
</EM><BR>
<P>Most interesting people?  I haven't heard that before.
<BR>
<P>Possible reasons for not moving: being afraid of crime rates.  Preferring to
<BR>
live in dense pedestrian-oriented cities, not boonie real estate or suburban
<BR>
deserts.  Not wishing to partake in a culture dependent upon cars (and cheap
<BR>
gas and subsidized roads, to trade cheap shots.)  Dependency on a culture with
<BR>
a much higher baseline concern for the quality of food.  A feeling that
<BR>
Europeans are better educated and more interesting, or that it's easier to
<BR>
find those who are, in coffeehouses and such.
<BR>
<P>I wonder what Amara will make of this.
