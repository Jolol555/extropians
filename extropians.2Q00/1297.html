<EM>&gt;  I'm kinda siding with Nadia on this one. Many prisons already have gyms, 
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  they do get used. Why not make the exercise machines such that the energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  expended is put to some use, since its already being expended anyways. Put 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  incentive on it, make each kWh generated worth x amount of time off their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sentence...heck I bet the prison system could produce some Tour de France
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  winners after a few years...

<P>Thanks, Mike.

First of all, it was a comedian who suggested it, it ain't gonna happen for 
<BR>
numerous reasons, most of them Politically Correct &quot;rights&quot; of the guys, 
<BR>
which I won't fight anyway..  slavery is illegal, even for convicts. There's 
<BR>
historical precedent for that law.
<BR>
<P><P>Who gives a good goddamn if some nerd think it's not going to pay out, 
<BR>
dollarwise. Do inmates weigh out dollar wise these days? Gimme a break. It 
<BR>
costs almost 50,000 dollars a year per death row inmate or some such 
<BR>
nonsense. (my source is dubious it's from Ice -T's book but it wouldn't 
<BR>
surprise me if it was true).
<BR>
Harvard costs less!
<BR>
The most important thing is, making guys ride a bike a huge pain in the ass, 
<BR>
and those guys are so lazy. And if it generates power or runs the TV's or 
<BR>
whatever, it's making them useful -- which is what most of them lack anyway 
<BR>
-- a purpose.
<BR>
<P>Listen, If they knew that instead of hanging' with the homey's trading 
<BR>
cigarettes and candy bars and getting in fights, that it'd be some kind of 
<BR>
endless bike marathon, prison would not hold the appeal that it does. I'm 
<BR>
serious, guys are lazy! 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;And it does hold appeal, believe me. Brought into a  world that is racist, 
<BR>
hostile towards illiterate and  poor youth (of any race) - where the best job 
<BR>
you can hope to get might be some kind of  fast food so you can work your 
<BR>
whole life to open up your own business reupholstering or cleaning houses, 
<BR>
BUT where the MOST likely outcome is being shot on the street (either by the 
<BR>
cops or by some other bored kid) jail holds a kind of security.  You don't 
<BR>
get shot in jail, usually. And you get fed.
<BR>
Plus talk about having no self responsibility! They tell you when to eat, 
<BR>
when to shower, when to go to the bathroom...
<BR>
No one would admit to wanting to be in jail, but the guys I work with have 
<BR>
dads in there, and they are pretty darn comfortable with the idea of 
<BR>
seventeen years to life.
