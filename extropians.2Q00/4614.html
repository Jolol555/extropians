To be blunt, I think there are a lot of people hanging out on the list
<BR>
who really are not extropians. Which is fine, since everyone has to be
<BR>
a newbie at some point and decide for themselves whether or not they
<BR>
really are or not. But some people seem to be unable to realize the fact
<BR>
that they are not really extropian at all. They rationalize to themselves
<BR>
that they are, but in fact the choices they continually make in their
<BR>
lives lead more down the path towards entropy. So they end up hanging
<BR>
around here, really not adding much besides noise.

<EM>&gt; note that it's curious how you appear to look down on non-individualists

<EM>&gt; such as commune-dwellers; yet you seem to value &quot;Belonging.&quot;. Did you truly
