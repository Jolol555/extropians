<EM>&gt; He didn't say 'les beans', or 'let's be in'. He said (dumb, ugly, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; treehugging) Lesbian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That was a purely uncivilized wisecrack, a disgusting sentiment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and he needed his ass kicked. 
</EM><BR>
<P>In retrospect, I realize that some elements of our society /do/
<BR>
believe that there is an association among those groups, and that
<BR>
the remark therefore taps into that cultural subconscious belief
<BR>
and may reinforce it (much the same as the description of a &quot;lazy
<BR>
black man&quot; might reinforce that stereotype, even if one happens to
<BR>
be innocently talking about a specific individual who happens to
<BR>
be lazy and black).  If I made a mistake here, it is the fact that
<BR>
I did not consider that cultural stereotype before I made the remark
<BR>
because I don't happen to hold it.  I normally take more care with
<BR>
my language even when being intentionally boorish, and I was sloppy
<BR>
here, but I honestly did not mean to reinforce any stereotypes
<BR>
about lesbians, tree-huggers, or anyone else; only to postulate
<BR>
the existence of some who fit all those descriptions for rhetorical
<BR>
effect (that obviously failed).
<BR>
<P>I do hold myself to a higher standard of expression, and while
<BR>
that standard does not include &quot;politeness&quot;, it does include
<BR>
precision, and knowing about the connotations of the words I use
<BR>
and the effects they might have.  I was sloppy here, and I ended
<BR>
up making implications I had no intention of making.  For that,
<BR>
I may be justly chastised, and I apologize.  After all, if I am
<BR>
to spread my belief that that being unclear or deceptive are far
<BR>
greater sins than being rude, I must hold myself to that.
<BR>
