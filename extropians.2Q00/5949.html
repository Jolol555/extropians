<P>Newest Survey Shows Most Americans Have Confidence in Science, But Lack 
<BR>
Understanding
<BR>
Science &amp; Engineering Indicators 2000 reports new data
<BR>
A 1999 survey on the public's understanding of science shows that while 
<BR>
Americans' confidence and interest in science and technology is very high, 
<BR>
their understanding of basic science facts and principles remains quite low.
<BR>
<P>The results of the survey are published in the National Science Board's (NSB) 
<BR>
biennial report to the President for Congress on the state of U.S. science, 
<BR>
engineering and technology, Science &amp; Engineering Indicators 2000. The survey 
<BR>
results show a slight improvement in public understanding of certain 
<BR>
scientific principles over the last two decades. However, the improvement has 
<BR>
been paralleled by a widespread belief in pseudosciences such as astrology, 
<BR>
alien abductions and extrasensory perception. 
<BR>
<P>The vast majority of Americans say that science and technology are making 
<BR>
their lives better, and describe their general reaction to science and 
<BR>
technology with words like &quot;hope&quot; and &quot;wonder.&quot; In contrast, only 17 percent 
<BR>
of respondents to the National Science Foundation-supported survey for S&amp;E 
<BR>
Indicators described themselves as well informed about new scientific 
<BR>
discoveries and the use of new inventions and technologies. Thirty percent 
<BR>
said they were poorly informed.
<BR>
<P>Answering a series of 20 questions designed to test basic knowledge, only 50 
<BR>
percent of Americans know how long it takes Earth to circle the sun, and most 
<BR>
still can't correctly describe in their own words some basic scientific 
<BR>
terms, including molecules, the Internet, and DNA, marking little improvement 
<BR>
over surveys conducted in 1995 and 1997.
<BR>
<P>The scientific process isn't well understood either. Only 21 percent of those 
<BR>
surveyed were able to explain what it means to study something 
<BR>
scientifically, just over half understood probability, and only a third knew 
<BR>
how an experiment is conducted.
<BR>
<P>Most of what Americans know about science comes from television and 
<BR>
newspapers, the report says, citing widespread consensus among scientists and 
<BR>
journalists that important information about science and technology is not 
<BR>
reaching the public. It also cites several surveys that show belief in the 
<BR>
pseudoscience is commonplace in the U.S. and traces this belief to the 
<BR>
entertainment industry.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Americans in the next decade will be asked to make important decisions that 
<BR>
will involve highly technical issues such as genetically engineered crops and 
<BR>
the preservation of biodiversity,&quot; says NSF director Rita Colwell. &quot;To 
<BR>
understand these issues, the public must be better informed about basic 
<BR>
science and engineering, as well as the scientific process.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Even if they don't understand it, Americans respect science. In 1999 a record 
<BR>
82 percent voiced support for federal funding of basic research. While 14 
<BR>
percent thought the government was spending too much on research, 37 percent 
<BR>
said not enough, the report says. Americans consistently believe that the 
<BR>
benefits of scientific research outweigh any harmful results. Public 
<BR>
confidence in the medical and scientific communities, the report points out, 
<BR>
is higher than in other American institutions, including education, the 
<BR>
Supreme Court, television, and the media.
