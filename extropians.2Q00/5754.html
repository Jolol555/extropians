<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It might seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  arrogant, but our system of laws is by far superior to that of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the UK or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  US. We have ended the era of court law about five hundred
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years ago when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Emperor Karl V compiled a code of laws for the Holy Roman Empire.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Karsten:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I hope I'll have the time to discuss this at more length with you soon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Suffice it to say that I don't agree with you.  I've had fairly extensive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience with civil code legal systems, and obviously quite a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anglo-American system of common law.  Generally, I find the civil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; code system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less flexible and much less amenable to a general atmosphere of rapid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; innovation than the common law system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that might seem this way at first, but I have great problems with the
<BR>
anglo-saxon system of common law. I will never  get used to explaining in
<BR>
each contract each little bit of right I wish to cease or get. And besides
<BR>
that the codes of law are abstract in a way that allows for them to be used
<BR>
in any relationship. Besides that the German law knows the common law or
<BR>
court law. It has been applied in certain cases and some of them have
<BR>
prevailed until today and are part of the legal system by now.
<BR>
<P>It would be interesting for me to know where you had your experience with
<BR>
civel code legal systems, as there are great differences between the
<BR>
European law systems, though this tends to diminish due to the European
<BR>
Community's Civil Code of Laws.
<BR>
