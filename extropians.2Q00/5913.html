The World Health Organisation 2000 Report that came out this week should, in
<BR>
theory, give us some help in choosing the healthiest places. However I found
<BR>
the summary statistics they gave to need so many qualifiers, ifs and buts,
<BR>
that it became just interesting reading rather that definitive answers.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.who.int/whr/">http://www.who.int/whr/</A>
<BR>
<P>Overall Health Care top 10..
<BR>
<P>1 France
<BR>
2 Italy
<BR>
3 San Marino
<BR>
4 Andorra
<BR>
5 Malta
<BR>
6 Singapore
<BR>
7 Spain
<BR>
8 Oman
<BR>
9 Austria
<BR>
10 Japan
<BR>
<P>The US outspent all other countries at 13.7 per cent of GDP, but was rated
<BR>
low because many Americans do not have health insurance. Similarly the US
<BR>
average healthy life expectancy was only around 70 (about 4.5 years less
<BR>
than countries like France, Austria and Japan). This was because there is a
<BR>
group of up to around 10 per cent of Americans who have such poor health
<BR>
that their life expectancy drops to around 50 and lowers the overall
<BR>
average.
<BR>
<P>I would think the same discrepancies would apply to almost every country.
<BR>
There must be a richer section with good diet and healthcare and a poorer
<BR>
section with worse diet and little healthcare in every nation.  So you have
<BR>
to take the national averages and adjust them up or down depending on where
<BR>
in each country you live and how much life and health resources you are able
<BR>
to get access to.
<BR>
<P>So if you are reasonably healthy and have good finances, at present you will
<BR>
probably have a life expectancy of around 80 in almost any of the modern,
<BR>
developed countries.
<BR>
<P>Then you can look at other factors like weather, stimulating environment,
<BR>
language, culture, safety, etc.
<BR>
<P>Hopefully Extropians would not all end up in the same country, because then
<BR>
they would be a mono-culture at risk of being totally wiped out!
