The interesting thing about being moderately smart is that it
<BR>
lets you *clearly* see how very smart the really smart people are.
<BR>
I'm often struck by &quot;everyday&quot; situations (some of which crop up
<BR>
quite often in Russia) where I become aware of how the average
<BR>
individual hasn't the faintest clue of the *real* range that
<BR>
intelligence can span.  I think there was a posting on the EI-list
<BR>
or on /. a few months ago about how &quot;clueless&quot; the average individual
<BR>
is.  It is presumably a form of mental self-preservation, not knowing
<BR>
what you really might be capable of with some IA.  But it touches
<BR>
on the issue of why more people aren't demonstrating in the
<BR>
streets in favor of technologies to uplift them to the levels mentioned 
<BR>
above.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I found this post very fascinating.  Being learning disabled but with an 
<BR>
average or slightly better then average I.Q., I can look around myself and 
<BR>
really appreciate the range of abilities that are out there.  I have some 
<BR>
friends in town with intellectual powers I have to admit I envy.  But still 
<BR>
I am sure I don't have the level of awareness to the extent that you 
<BR>
indicate.  It makes sense that the extremely brainy folks can best 
<BR>
appreciate the super brainy folks! lol
<BR>
<P>I have read how the brains of the brightest people show up on scans as using 
<BR>
much less effort then those of less intelligent who must 'strain' to figure 
<BR>
out the same puzzle.  So less effort and better results.
<BR>
<P>I think people will be protesting in the streets when they see augmented 
<BR>
intelligence being used in others, but they cannot access it due to price or 
<BR>
government restrictions.  It is still seen as somewhat 'science fiction' by 
<BR>
many.
<BR>
<P>The truth is many people have not even learned to properly train and use the 
<BR>
brain they already have(which generally is pretty good) with present and 
<BR>
ancient methods of development.  I am one of these people.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
You can put &quot;Wouldn't you like to add 50 points to your IQ?&quot; in
<BR>
the same class as &quot;Wouldn't you like to double your expected
<BR>
lifespan?&quot;.  Most people have no idea what it really means.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I would love to have those extra fifty points added to my I.Q. and also have 
<BR>
a much better memory.  I would have a chance of keeping up should I ever 
<BR>
make it to an Extro!  And also I could go into any career field that 
<BR>
interested me.  A high-level of intelligence to me means literally having 
<BR>
the power to fully grasp the opportunities around you and succeed socially, 
<BR>
sexually and financially.  I think you are right that most people have no 
<BR>
idea what it really means.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John
