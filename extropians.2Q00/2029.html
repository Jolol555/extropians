<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Please specify such machines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Out of six machines I tried, two failures. All were machines with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; supported hardware, which had successfully installed other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; distributions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Details please...
</EM><BR>
<P>I fail to see what this contributes to the discussion, but these are
<BR>
basic specs of the two I had trouble with.
<BR>
<P>Problem machine #1
<BR>
<P>PII-300MHz
<BR>
64MB SDRAM
<BR>
6.4GB IDE HD
<BR>
Gigabyte m/b (BX chipset)
<BR>
ATI graphics card
<BR>
[I do not recall model, &amp; this one was not my machine]
<BR>
<P>Problem machine #2
<BR>
<P>Pentium/100MHz
<BR>
32MB FP RAM
<BR>
1GB IDE HD
<BR>
S3 ViRGE DX
<BR>
Intel FX chipset m/b
<BR>
<P>What caught my attention, as I mentioned before, is that both were
<BR>
very standard and well supported hardware. Due to Corel's pretty loading
<BR>
screen, I was also unable to tell at what stage problems had occured. 
<BR>
<P>I can check my mail archives if you wish to know details from others who
<BR>
have had problems, but I suggest ask me off-list as I fail to see how
<BR>
this is relevant. This thread has dragged a long way off topic. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I do know from LUG mailing lists that others have had more problems than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; usual - but as I said before, I don't pass on rumours.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (and thus the only one qualified to be price compared for similar value)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm afraid I fail to understand this logic. When did we suddenly decide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the installation procedure (something most consumers never deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with anyway!) was the important factor in the value of an OS?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; How easy it is for their computer tech to install determines what they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; pay for their computer, right????
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I assume you mean this tounge-in-cheek, yes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not at all. Time is money.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you believe someone sits down and runs the install program for every
<BR>
machine that is sold with a pre-installed copy of Windows, you are
<BR>
wrong. The install is run once and the installed system simply cloned
<BR>
off to other machines. This is one of the main reasons PC companies produce
<BR>
standardised models.
<BR>
<P>Also, you began this point with complaints of Linux's ease (and hence
<BR>
necessary time) of installation - in the context of average consumers
<BR>
performing the installs. One assumes, however, that a technician
<BR>
preparing installations for a PC manufacturer would be competent and
<BR>
thus need no more time for setting up a Linux installation than he would
<BR>
a Windows one.
<BR>
<P>In fact, using Linux actually makes things quicker and easier from the
<BR>
point of view of a PC manufacturer. An installed copy of Windows can be
<BR>
cloned, as I said - but it is very closely bound to the hardware
<BR>
configuration of the machine it was set up on, so all models must be
<BR>
identical (or at least from a few set models for which images have been
<BR>
prepared). Windows keeps (for no particularly sensible reason, I might
<BR>
add) a device inventory stored on the disk as part of the registry, and
<BR>
is very closely bound to this. A Windows installation gets *very*
<BR>
confused if started up on another set of hardware.
<BR>
<P>Linux, however, handles things much more dynamically. A company could
<BR>
quite feasibly produce a single installation that could be cloned to
<BR>
*all* their production machines.
