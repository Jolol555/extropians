</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ahem: if we play this game, I'll have to cite the CIA's fun activities

<EM>&gt; in the 1960's and 1970's. Or Oliver North's little escapades. Clue: the

<EM>&gt; do with the Irish issue and everything to do with militant animal rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protestors blowing up meat packing warehouses.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ollie and the CIA never, to my knowledge killed anyone, up until the present
<BR>
administration, who was an american citizen, with the sole exception of a few americans
<BR>
who were assisting communist insurgents in central America, and they got offed by CIA
<BR>
clients, not by the CIA itself. By definition, foreign communist geurillas are open
<BR>
season. Nobody in the White House ever ordered anyone to off an American, a market
<BR>
contrast to the practices of the Intelligence Section over there...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; You say the income tax is lower? What are the brackets, the percentages? What are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the deductions? What is the cost of living?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, speaking as a non-accountant, I'm in the top income tax bracket --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paying 40% on taxable income about 28K (pounds, not dollars). I don't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any recent figures to hand, but the last ones I saw suggested that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gross proportion of income we pay in tax here is about 39%, compared with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 38% in the USA and &gt;40% anywhere else in the EU. (Sweden, with the highest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rate, was around 55%.)
</EM><BR>
<P>&amp;28,000 equals, at a current exchange rate of 1 to 1.48, an income of $41,440.00.
<BR>
Assuming you are single, you have an initial deduction of $5700.00. Thus your taxable
<BR>
income is $35,740.00. With no other deductions or writoffs, your tax would be the
<BR>
following:
<BR>
<P>single        married filing jointly        married filing separately        head of
<BR>
household
<BR>
$6,936    $5,509                            $7,485
<BR>
$5,792
<BR>
19.4%    15.4%                              20.9%                                16.2%
<BR>
<P>If you have any dependents, you would have additional deductions of I believe $2,000
<BR>
each, thus lowering your taxable income and thus your tax bracket.
<BR>
<P>Looking at the tax tables the IRS has on its website:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/ind_info/tax_tables/">http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/ind_info/tax_tables/</A>
<BR>
You can see that even for people in the top tax bracket published, around $100,000.00,
<BR>
they are only paying about 28% of their income, which is the top bracket for most
<BR>
people. The higher brackets you speak of that are in the upper thirty something percent
<BR>
rates are for people that make many hundreds of thousands of dollars. It was part of
<BR>
Clinton's 'Eat the Rich' Tax plan.
<BR>
<P>So you are paying at least twice as much income tax as we pay over here for the same
<BR>
income, and that isn't even accounting for your cost of living. I'd imagine that your
<BR>
cost of living on 28K pounds sterling is probably equal to $28K over here, possibly
<BR>
less. In which case, you are getting raped.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One problem in the UK is the cosy marketing cartels. For example, automobiles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost a LOT more here than elsewhere -- not because they're rare or because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they're heavily taxed, but because the UK is a captive market. Right hand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drive vehicles, right? Makes it a bit hard to hop over the channel and buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one. So the manufacturers all sell via a nice cosy dealership arrangement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that sees the same model selling for 30-40% more in the UK. (This particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example is now collapsing under the weight of anti-trust investigations and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; e-commerce entrepreneurs handling imports, and the dealerships are screaming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blue murder, but it indicates a pattern underlying the cost of living in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UK -- which is high, but not necessarily because of taxation.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you saying you don't have the right to refuse to participate in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the health care system and the social security system?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do _you_ have the right to health care or social security if you refuse to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pay for them?
</EM><BR>
<P>Most people who get government health care pay little or nothing for it (and pay little
<BR>
or nothing in taxes). The rest of us pick up the tab.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have the right to refuse to use them.  But they're there. And they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; represent a _lot_ of personal insurance premiums I'd be paying if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weren't, and a lot of surplus value going into a fat, parasitic insurance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;       ..... And the UK has been becoming increasingly, radically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; diverse since the end of the 1950's.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Its still lily white compared to the US.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Still into the one-upmanship?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These days, the UK is approximately 7% non-white. Yeah, that's lilly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; white compared to the US. It is, however, a major departure from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; historical record.
</EM><BR>
<P>True. I have asserted that the relatively low homicide rates over there are
<BR>
specifically because you don't have anywhere near the number of minorities as we do, as
<BR>
most homicide is minority on minority crime here. Its got nothing to do with guns,
<BR>
while the lack of guns is specifically why your property crime rate is so high...
