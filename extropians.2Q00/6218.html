<EM>&gt; Hey - we don't get nearly as many payments of membership dues and other

<EM>&gt; contributions to ExI and Foresight as we should, given the growing interest

<EM>&gt; in the subjects these organizations address.  My point is that something like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Greenstar may well be a better and smarter use of a different kind of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charitable donation than, say &quot;Save the Children&quot; or the like.

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speaking of &quot;explicitly transhumanist work,&quot; what might some of
<BR>
those be? it seems to me that all the basic enabling technologies of the
<BR>
transhuman vision are right on schedule; they are not receiving charity,
<BR>
but investment capital -- because they give immediate economic payoffs at
<BR>
almost every step of the way. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what then constitutes explicitly transhumanist work? without
<BR>
slowing down my typing, i might think of three: 1. increasing public
<BR>
awareness of the coming tide; 2. catalyzing more integrated and
<BR>
cross-disciplinary research; 3. helping those already aware of what's
<BR>
coming to better prepare for the future. of course, there is also 4.
<BR>
forcasting the far-distant future (when i learn how to count again). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personally, i think 4 is cute but not really essential. on the
<BR>
other hand, a project such as greenstar does seem to serve 1, 2, and 3
<BR>
adequately. a successful greenstar operation could quicken the public's
<BR>
subconscious future shock, challenge age-old conceptions, demonstrate the
<BR>
beneficial potential of technology, encourage cross-pollination of ideas
<BR>
to create a viable whole, appease the hardcore &quot;greens,&quot; and potentially
<BR>
give transhumanists greater voice and leverage. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;admittedly, hidden snags may make greenstar infeasible off-paper
<BR>
(i have yet to check out the site); but then again, it's only an example.
<BR>
another example would be something such as establishing a singularity fund
<BR>
to support eliezer's TAI. however, i think supporting research by revenue
<BR>
is preferable to supporting research by charity, whenever possible. after
<BR>
all, the short-sightedness of human consumers is the ultimate force behind
<BR>
almost all popular movements. there is something to be said for untimely
<BR>
vision, but also something to be said for directing the public through
<BR>
timely feedback.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to end this ramble, i must admit i haven't a clue what i'm talking
<BR>
about ... what might we do? i submit to the greater minds.
