<P><EM>    &gt; union workers as in a) high salary for low skill work, b) lots of convoluted, expensive,
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;and time  wasting work rules,
</EM><BR>
<P>If your opinion of unions is that low then why are you worried that technology will
<BR>
render them obsolete; or are you just a fan of incompetence and red tape?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; the turmoil of crashing markets
</EM><BR>
<P>Oil markets will crash, fusion markets will not.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;will cause large amounts of capital to evaporate.
</EM><BR>
<P>So if an airline, for example, found its fuel bill was now zero that would cause
<BR>
financial difficulty for the company and it would no longer be able to finance expansion.
<BR>
Does that sound right to you?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Actually, stealth technology *is* being used commercially, even down to the point
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;where you can buy a bra for your car made of stealth material to help protect
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;yourself against radar speed traps.
</EM><BR>
<P>And if a stealth bra is not worth a few hundred billion dollars what is? Your tax dollars
<BR>
at work. What's next, Tang and non stick frying pans?
<BR>
<P><EM>        &gt;I don't know the cost of a B-1 bomber (which is not a stealth bomber)
</EM><BR>
<P>True, I meant to say a B2 bomber
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;but the B-2 bomber  (which is a stealth bomber) costs around $800 million
</EM><BR>
<P>The cost per airplane is about 2 billion, but the military can get very creative with
<BR>
their accounting when they want good PR, you could probably get a $800 million
<BR>
figure if you ignored the huge R&amp;D bill (mostly D), but as there are no plans to build
<BR>
any more of these white elephants that doesn't seem like good accounting practice to me.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;A B-2 bomber weighs  over 400,000 lb. which equals 6.4 million ounces. An ounce of
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;gold goes for around $250-300, which  makes the weight of the B-2 in gold equal to
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;about $1.6-1.95 billion,
</EM><BR>
<P>Sound just about right.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; What it did have to do with technology and productivity is that the change in market demand
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;for grain in the negative to that extent was not foreseen by the farmers, or by the bankers
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;who allowed them to mortgage their farms to buy all the latest and greatest farm equipment
</EM><BR>
<P>If I've parsed that formidable sentence correctly then foreign governments stopped importing
<BR>
food and local government jacked up interest rates so high that farmers could no longer pay
<BR>
their bills and that's technology's fault. Huh?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;which is what allowed them to overproduce.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, there were plenty of people willing to pay good money for the products American farmers
<BR>
made but were prevented from doing so by third parties and the root cause of this mess is
<BR>
overproduction and technology. Huh?
<BR>
