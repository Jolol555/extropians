I learned about Sasha's death just before I left
<BR>
for a trip to Berlin over this last weekend.  I
<BR>
didn't really have something to say then, which I
<BR>
assumed was because I was very busy preparing for
<BR>
my trip.  Now that I am back I realize that I am
<BR>
still at a loss for words.
<BR>
<P>I guess if I were at a service I would be quiet and
<BR>
look into people's eyes and know that they felt a
<BR>
loss as I felt.  Here on email it is so hard to
<BR>
communicate subtle emotional tones, and any lengthy
<BR>
thing I could say just seems too crude.  So I'll just
<BR>
say:
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodbye Sasha, we'll miss you.
<BR>
<P><P><P>By the way, we should feel a great loss even if he had
<BR>
been frozen, since the odds of success don't seem that
<BR>
great.  Which isn't to say we shouldn't try.
<BR>
(I'm signed up with Alcor.)
<BR>
<P>One lesson we might want to learn here is that we brainy
<BR>
discuss big ideas types might try to pay more attention
<BR>
to the emotional health of those among us.
