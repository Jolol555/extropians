<EM>&gt; The thing you have to remember about a VR is that it isn't an alternate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universe. Any transformation that happens in the virtual world has to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implemented as an actual transformation on real particles in a physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system. It doesn't have to be the *same* transformation, but it has to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *some* transformation of equal or greater information content. No matter how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cleverly you design the VR, it will always have this constraint due to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simple fact that the virtual world has no independent existence.
</EM><BR>
<P>So you are in the VR, and you have built a computer which holds a 1
<BR>
or a 0, and you want to erase it.  Obviously there is no need for the
<BR>
VR to simulate anything becoming hotter.  It can simulate any laws of
<BR>
physics it wants to, and it need not be constrained by the usual laws
<BR>
of thermodynamics.
<BR>
<P>However in the physical world if the VR erasure is mirrored by a physical
<BR>
erasure, that must dissipate heat.  The amount dissipated need not have
<BR>
any particular bearing on the amount that the VR person would calculate,
<BR>
though.
<BR>
<P>For one thing, the amount of heat dissipated per erasure depends on the
<BR>
temperature.  The simulated temperature in the VR doesn't have anything
<BR>
to do with the temperature of the physical system.  The VR may appear
<BR>
to be erasing a bit in a room temperature computer while the physical
<BR>
computer running the VR is cryogenically cooled.
<BR>
<P>It could also be possible to reduce the cost of erasure or even avoid
<BR>
it altogether, by the trick of running the simulation forward while
<BR>
preserving all the extra bits, then running it backwards to erase the
<BR>
calculation and the extra bits.  You can do this every so often and
<BR>
just snapshot the state that is needed to proceed with the calculation.
<BR>
The result is that many erasures wouldn't get counted, only those which
<BR>
are necessary to go from one snapshot to the next.
