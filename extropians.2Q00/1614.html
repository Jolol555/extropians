<P>&quot;If you magically introduced one of these aircars for a price of about $20,000
<BR>
today, with a production capacity of a million units a year, GM, Ford, 
<BR>
Toyota, Daimler Chrysler, et al would all be declaring bankruptcy in short 
<BR>
order, and you'd have millions of unionized autoworkers out on the streets 
<BR>
unemployed. Markets woul crash (all except your AirCar, Inc. stock), wealth 
<BR>
would evaporate, consumer spending would decrease (all those autoworkers 
<BR>
unemployed), and you'd get the vicious cycle I described earlier. Those other 
<BR>
companies could try to introduce similar products, but they can't compete 
<BR>
being saddled by all those union labor costs, by their outmoded factories, 
<BR>
and their lack of automation.  Are you starting to see what I am getting at?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't this basically the phenomena that Marx saw correctly and then 
<BR>
described as the weakness of Capitalism
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that because Capitalism was constantly undergoing this sort of 
<BR>
change and disrupting people and constantly requiring reinvestment that would 
<BR>
not be required in a planned economy that Capitalism would eventually 
<BR>
collapse?  Is that a fair representation of his position?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But isn't it also true that while our changes do cause disruptions and 
<BR>
other economic damage, in the short run, that in the long run those same 
<BR>
phenomena are what caused Capitalism to thrive and Communism to collapse.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider what a really accurate watch used to cost.  Then along came the 
<BR>
digital watch and an entire industry disappeared.  But today does anyone miss 
<BR>
them?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same token the vinyl disk record disappeared; they tell me that 
<BR>
the CD is going to get its comeuppance also.  The record of disappeared 
<BR>
industries that have been advantageously is so long it would bore you for me 
<BR>
to tell it.  In fact the same auto industry you cited destroyed all sorts of 
<BR>
industries.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the world gets better.
