<EM>&gt; the US is.  No matter how &quot;tyrannical&quot; the US is, they never force you to

<EM>&gt; somewhere else.  Or is every single nation on the planet a tyranny in your

<EM>&gt; eyes?
</EM><BR>
<P>Or go live for a few years in Holland. Or Scotland. On paper they're not
<BR>
*that* much better than the USA, but in practice ...
<BR>
<P>Tyranny seems to me to be measurable on some kind of non-linear scale. 
<BR>
People are never satisfied with the liberties they have, and are bad at
<BR>
gauging the differences between places they've never visited on the basis
<BR>
of available resources.  (Hence the oddly widespread idea that America is
<BR>
the freest/richest/best place on the planet.) Right now, we in the west
<BR>
are in an uneasy position; we're mostly free-er than we have ever been
<BR>
before, but there are internal dynamics within our culture attempting
<BR>
to impose restraints (or monitoring) on us for a variety of reasons which,
<BR>
although specious, don't strike the general bulk of the population (who
<BR>
Don't Get It) as being irrelevent.
<BR>
<P>But, historically, freedoms come and go. It's a long, generational
<BR>
trend ...  what one generation takes for granted may be squandered;
<BR>
and the next buys it back with blood.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I think Zero picked a bad example; Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq
<BR>
are _not_ comparable. Given a choice between those three, I'd go for Iran
<BR>
any day. Iraq is essentially a Nazi dictatorship, except that you can
<BR>
substitute &quot;New Arab Man&quot; for &quot;Aryan&quot; as necessary in their ideology
<BR>
and politics. Want to be tortured to death by the secret police? Spit
<BR>
on a portrait of the boss man. Iran, in contrast, has a predominantly
<BR>
young population, democratic institutions, a power struggle in progress
<BR>
between the old stick-in-the-mud clergy and the rest of the population,
<BR>
and an underground dance music scene. The Gulf War on 1982-88 did for
<BR>
the Ayatollah's revolution pretty much what World War One did for the
<BR>
19th century imperial dynasties of Europe: Iran is very definitely in a
<BR>
post-revolutionary phase and liberalising about as fast as is possible
<BR>
without hatching another revolution. The end result is likely to be, in
<BR>
another decade, the first home-grown liberal free-market democracy in 
<BR>
the Islamic world. 
<BR>
<P>Afghanistan, of course, is another matter entirely. But then, Afghanistan
<BR>
has _always_ been the ass-end of the universe. (If you think the Russians
<BR>
had it bad there in the 1980's, you may find it illuminating to read an
<BR>
account of General Elphinstone's expedition and the British relationship
<BR>
with Afghanistan in the mid-nineteenth century.)
