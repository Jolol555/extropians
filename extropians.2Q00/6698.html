<P>
In a week we will get an opportunity seldom enjoyed by us: a
<BR>
direct test of a concept we have been debating.  Next Friday
<BR>
there will be an attempted intercept of a missile with a missile.
<BR>
Nowthen, I will make the following speculation: if the intercept
<BR>
fails, it will make jubilant headlines on the front page of the
<BR>
San Jose Mercury News.  If on the other hand the intercept
<BR>
succeeds, this same organization will mumble a few lines buried
<BR>
deep within, altho either outcome is equally news-worthy.
<BR>
This I predict in spite of my scolding I gave them over unbalanced
<BR>
treatment of news stories.
<BR>
<P>Anyone wish to speculate on the outcome?  I predict a hit.
<BR>
Heres part of what the Post had to say:
<BR>
<P>On July 7, an interceptor launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific
<BR>
will attempt to knock down a dummy warhead fired from Vandenberg
<BR>
Air Force Base in California. Key factors in the test include not only the
<BR>
ability of the &quot;kill vehicle&quot; to hit the dummy 144 miles above the Earth
<BR>
at a combined speed of 12,000 miles per hour, but also the ability of
<BR>
early-warning satellites to detect the launch and convey that information
<BR>
to a command and control center, which in turn sends the data to Kwajalein.
