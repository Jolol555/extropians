Amara:
<BR>
<P>I LOVED your post.  It echoes something I've come to appreciate in the last 
<BR>
couple of years, especially the last few months; that is that consciously 
<BR>
cultivating behavior aimed at a SLOWER pace has substantial benefits in many 
<BR>
aspects of my life.  In particular, I've come to appreciate working in the 
<BR>
garden around our house as I never had before.  This used to be a &quot;marital 
<BR>
chore&quot; for me, but something &quot;clicked&quot; in me this Spring, and I've begun to 
<BR>
relish the time I spend working with the plants and soil.  One sign of this 
<BR>
is that I've begun to learn plant names, something that I never could manage 
<BR>
to do before.  Making myself a part of the life cycle of the plants in our 
<BR>
garden has taught me to appreciate a time scale I never really FELT before: 
<BR>
I've come to accept that some things can't be hurried, but by slowing the 
<BR>
tempo of my perceptions and expectations and carefully paying attention to 
<BR>
the small signs of slow change in the developing plants I husband, I've been 
<BR>
able to tap into a reservoir of insight and calm I never knew before.
<BR>
<P>You can see some of the fruits of my efforts this Spring at:

<BR>
<P>I've just begun to explore how potent this new tempo is.  Learning to SLOW 
<BR>
DOWN and PAY ATTENTION to phenomena that happen over long time periods has 
<BR>
been like discovering a whole new country for me.  I can see the positive 
<BR>
effects in many areas of my life, coming to sense in a much more vivid way 
<BR>
how various different elements of social systems develop at different paces, 
<BR>
for instance.
<BR>
<P>All from just taking time to smell (and grow) the roses . . .
