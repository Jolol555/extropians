Robin writes, quoting Hal:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;However upon closer study, I noticed some things which made me more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;skeptical.  His model often lags the actual stock price movements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;This is especially noticeable in the 1929 crash.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;But actually you can argue that the drop in dividends in 1930 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;onward was caused in part by the stock market crash. ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It seems, therefore, that the stock market crash led to dividend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reductions, which then caused his model to predict a stock market crash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;But that's not a good prediction because the causative condition only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;occured after the supposed effect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The paper I cited (which I just emailed to you) has some statistical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tests that should not have this problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks, I also found the paper online at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/pdf_files/Fluctuate.pdf">http://econ161.berkeley.edu/pdf_files/Fluctuate.pdf</A>.  BTW I think the
<BR>
title is a little joke, based on JP Morgan's famous comment when asked
<BR>
what the market would do: &quot;it will fluctuate&quot;.
<BR>
<P>This version of the paper was harder for me to follow, apparently part
<BR>
of an ongoing debate in the research community where I am not familiar
<BR>
with all the background.  But the basic model was essentially the same,
<BR>
calculating &quot;warranted&quot; (i.e. justifiable by a rational investor) stock
<BR>
prices based on estimated future dividends, and making those estimates
<BR>
based on current and past dividend levels.  Again the authors are able
<BR>
to show that much of the variability in stock prices over the longer term
<BR>
(10-20 years) is captured by this model.
<BR>
<P>However I feel that my complaint is still valid, that the model could
<BR>
be fundamentally wrong and still show correlation to actual prices,
<BR>
by implicitly and subtly including real prices in the calculation.
<BR>
Real prices affect dividend levels, and so a model which sets warranted
<BR>
prices based on dividends may be expected to correlate with real prices,
<BR>
after some time lag.  Since real prices correlate with themselves over
<BR>
the short term the result is that this kind of model can show correlation
<BR>
even though it has no actual predictive value.
<BR>
<P>The specific statistic used is the variance of 20 year price changes
<BR>
versus changes in the modeled price.  But I think that if you looked at
<BR>
20 year price changes against the 20 year price changes lagged a year
<BR>
or two, there would be a very close relationship and the lagged prices
<BR>
would &quot;explain&quot; much of the actual variation.  Any model which produces
<BR>
reasonably correct prices after a time lag can look good by this statistic
<BR>
but is very questionable as a true explanation.
<BR>
<P>Their figure VI, which shows price/dividend ratios, illustrates that
<BR>
their model does not predict this value very well.  Obviously if you
<BR>
looked at the deltas, so that you'd have delta-price/delta-dividend
<BR>
ratios, the model would be even worse, essentially useless.  But this
<BR>
is where I see the fundamental failing of their model being exposed,
<BR>
as actual prices may lead dividend changes, while their modeled prices
<BR>
must always follow them.  (Of course this kind of data is incredibly
<BR>
noisy so it is not a very meaningful way to test a model.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another interpretation of the lag is that stocks embody information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about future dividends that are not embodied in this history of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; past dividends.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's possible, but it is not what the paper is trying to model.  If
<BR>
this is what is happening then investors must get that information from
<BR>
somewhere, and it should be possible to come up with an even better model
<BR>
that uses that source of information and predicts prices more closely.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Also, whenever I read these kinds of papers I want to see whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;analysis works when extrapolated forward.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I doubt that it would predict the degree of increase the market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;has actually seen, with P/E ratios much higher than historical averages.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My doubt isn't as strong as yours, but yes it would be interested to see.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's amazing when you look at these charts, which extend to about
<BR>
1990, and see how they would have to change to hold data up to the
<BR>
present.  Markets are up by something like a factor of 5 in the past
<BR>
decade, and even counting for inflation, the charts would have to be 50%
<BR>
taller and go almost straight up to hold the data for the past 10 years.
