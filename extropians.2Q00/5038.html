<EM>&gt;&gt;  I must say that for any of you guys
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  looking for hot intelligent hetero women, the GOP is the place to go. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  met more fine fine women at GOP wingdings than just about anywhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Can I throw up now? Mike, whatever possesed you to say such a thing in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;public forum, where anyone can just look up the archives
</EM><BR>
<P>I like the guys who rev-up their engines and then drive by really fast and
<BR>
look around to see if anyone is watching.  I also like the guys at the gym
<BR>
who grunt really, really loud. 
<BR>
<P>So what if I  like to go to the places where I can see guys -- really hot
<BR>
guys -- the ones with the you know in their pants.  Makes me pant.  So what
<BR>
if I like to go places where I can see real men.
<BR>
<P>Don't matter to me if they like politics and stuff.
<BR>
