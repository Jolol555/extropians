<P>Most of Damien B.'s items weren't invented in nations as we use the term

today.  And 'without economic restriction' really needs qualification.  His

early examples probably came from societies with a social obligation to

redistribute food surpluses, otherwise known as primitive famine insurance.

(Or not even famine.  Hunting can be a matter of luck as well as skill.)

<P>But yes, socialist countries aren't known for their high inventiveness.  China
<BR>
didn't get far with the gun.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I can't verify that for sure. I think if I'd asked for inventions confined 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the 20th century, and you gave answers which were completely honest, at

<EM>&gt; I think a nation like Australia or Canada, nations with mixed economies (I 
</EM><BR>
<P>But most economists would not call Australia or Canada socialist, and would
<BR>
call the United States (and Japan) mixed.  Japan has a ministry of
<BR>
technological development, remember, although I don't know what MITI has been
<BR>
involved in.  And much of the United States' advantage (besides size and not
<BR>
having wars fought on its own soil) comes from the university system, which
<BR>
receives quite a lot of government support.
<BR>
<P>The Internet was a military research project, remember, and funded by DARPA
<BR>
and university money for a long time.  The New Economy has its roots in gov't
<BR>
nurturing.
<BR>
<P>More generally, if you ask for inventions confined to the 20th century, none
<BR>
of them will come from nations without economic restriction, if you let that
<BR>
include tariffs, high income taxes, and safety nets.

<EM>&gt; with Canada) would progress very slowly if not for the innovations of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US.
</EM><BR>
<P>And size isn't insignificant.  Saying the US produces more inventions than
<BR>
Canada and Australia isn't surprising.  We do happen to dwarf the population
<BR>
of any other Western nation.  Plus their economies have largely coalesced
<BR>
around exporting raw materials to larger countries.
<BR>
<P>And I'm sure there are people on this list who would call the United States
<BR>
socialist, although I'd call them nuts.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There may be a lot of great inventions floating around in Australia, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without the marketing and corporate aspect, they're not going to find a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place in the everyday life of most people.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the meantime those nasty European socialists seem to be enjoying better
<BR>
cell phones than we do.  I think Japanese mobile data is even more advanced,
<BR>
judging by Wall Street Journal articles.  They were 18 months ahead of Europe
<BR>
who were 18 months ahead of the United States.
<BR>
<P>Note I'm not arguing that socialism works or that markets are bad.  But
<BR>
simplistic black-and-white labelling gets my goat.
