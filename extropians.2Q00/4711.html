<EM>&gt; &gt; Interesting.  So, if you were blindfolded, do you think you could smell the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; difference between a Japanese and a Mexican and tell us which was which?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think so, though I am not 100% positive.  As I said, this is something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've noticed; my aggregate sample size may not be large enough to mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything, although my samples do cover a broad range of ethnic groups.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do know of other people who have noticed the same thing though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, this isn't that precise, so I wouldn't say &quot;Japanese&quot;; the person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could just as likely be Korean or similar.  However, I think a person that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;trained&quot; their nose could make race determination quite accurately.  My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nose really hasn't been in training lately, so my smell memory is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit weak right now :^)  However, Mexican versus Japanese should be pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easy to differentiate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Surely I'm not the only person on this list to notice this.

<P>A recent thread on the Forteana list discussed the variations in smell due
<BR>
to diet and/or hygiene.  My experience with women in Vietnam and Thailand
<BR>
is that they have a salty smell with an ambiance of seafood, depending on
<BR>
their diet.
<BR>
<P>Isn't mere mention of ethnic smell differences somewhat misleading?  Many
<BR>
Americans are perceived as giving off an odor of baby milk or dairy products.
<BR>
We don't notice this unless we don't use dairy products very much or are
<BR>
strict vegetarians.
<BR>
<P>A bus in Rome on a hot day is more than a visual experience!
