<EM>&gt; You see, already having discounted IQ testing at about age
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; twelve, I did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; walk away from that book with that &quot;goal&quot; in mind. What I saw as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;goal&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; was to show how even scientists who truly believe they are doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; honest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; research are mislead by their own beliefs, even him.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree. He was trying to show that the phrenologists probably made
<BR>
systematic errors without really being aware of it. It is just that
<BR>
certain seemingly commonsense decisions in the process actually
<BR>
escaped clear thinking. Political influences, might have
<BR>
favoured a particular result, and if research happened to lead to
<BR>
results in accord with this, there may have been less motive
<BR>
to check results thoroughly.  
<BR>
<P>I think that the argument for cultural bias, at least in the earlier
<BR>
versions of IQ tests, is well presented. The tests depicted in his
<BR>
book were ridiculously parochial (like knowing details of certain
<BR>
American sports), considering they were given to immigrants. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; IQ testing might be flawed, but the notion of general intelligence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be.  My point was not to support either, but to show that Gould is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faulty arguments.  Specifically, the juxtaposition I talk about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; above.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, if his goal &quot;was to show how even scientists who truly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are doing honest research are mislead by their own beliefs,&quot; he's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one-sided.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've read several of his books and his view seems to be this. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supports a view which can be used against his egalitarian politics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obviously bad intentioned, while if someone knowingly distorts a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; view to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support his eqalitarian politics, then that person is merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mistaken.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even if Gould falsely one-sidedly motives to particular scientists,
<BR>
this doesn't seem to me to discredit the basic idea of hidden
<BR>
prejudices/ sloppy thinking.  Whether deliberate or unconscious, the
<BR>
result is distortion. Scientists *are* human, and although the
<BR>
scientific method correctly applied ought to guard against mistakes,
<BR>
they DO happen. People can have a lot on their minds.
<BR>
<P>[...]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Surely, all sorts of thinkers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; err, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they do not always err because of their political views.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;No, but it can happen and should be considered.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Hopefully some thinkers might change their politics instead.
<BR>
