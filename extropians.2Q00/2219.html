<P>Aha, Eugene is back, or maybe this thread simply got through his filters...

Or maybe its a lurking AIbot...

<EM>&gt;  &gt; Imagine I could simulate, in real time, a system of 100 atoms using 50

<EM>&gt; Of course, you can't do that. Also, you don't mention which modelling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paradigm you're contemplating, say QM or MD.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but what got this going was Moravec's article using Higgsinium or
<BR>
Monopolium as the denser atomic &quot;matter&quot; for the computer (not &quot;more&quot;
<BR>
matter, just &quot;denser&quot; matter) and Freidkin's construction of a cellular
<BR>
automata at the Planck limits.  So its a CA architecture operating at
<BR>
Planck limits in a volume the size of a star.  Unclear is what the darn
<BR>
thing weighs (e.g. whether you violate the black hole densities, though
<BR>
you probably could rotate it very rapidly).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; fidelity. Why can't I then harness each of these groups and construct 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 2 simulated 50 atom computers? There's an infinite regress here. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Regarding Billy's comments, I went and got some numbers.
<BR>
Covalent atomic bonds are usually in the range of 0.5-1.7 aJ.
<BR>
von Neuman's classical limits on computer switching are kT ln 2
<BR>
ranging from 4.1x10^-3 aJ at room temps to 5.9x10^-5 aJ at lHe temp.
<BR>
<P>So, if you represent a bond by a bit in a switch that can
<BR>
flip at something close to the theoretical limits, you can
<BR>
simulate that bond using 3-4 orders of magnitude less energy.
<BR>
This makes sense because one is probably representing the bit
<BR>
as a single electron, atomic magnetic alignment, etc.
<BR>
Brillouin [1962] got a similar result using photons to detect holes
<BR>
in punched tape (presumably related to the probability that
<BR>
the photon can reliably cause a change in the energy level of
<BR>
an electron orbiting an atom.  This makes sense when you
<BR>
consider that only UV photons have enough energy to break
<BR>
atomic bonds.
<BR>
<P>Now, if you can represent that bond by the position of a very
<BR>
low energy photon in a photon &quot;gas&quot;, you can probably drive
<BR>
the cost of the simulation even lower.
<BR>
<P>Anyone know the energy required to flip the magnetic alignment
<BR>
of an atom?
