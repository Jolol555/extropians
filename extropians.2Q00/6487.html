I think this list is much too hard on the Green Party, they perform useful functions,
<BR>
comic relief for one thing. In addition it draws voters from Gore who is even worse
<BR>
than bush. I guess. Mr. Nader would cause little harm and might to great things.
<BR>
If he became president it's unlikely his loony pollicies would ever become law,
<BR>
government gridlock is your friend;  and in the age of the Internet it's even more
<BR>
unlikely that the new laws could ever be enforced. All this would at the very least cause
<BR>
a devastating defeat for the Green Party in the mid term election in 2002, if not
<BR>
impeachment of Mr. Nader for incompetence. The contempt for government would
<BR>
be great and long remembered and thus be weakened. Thank you Mr. Nader.
<BR>
<P>I more  worried about Pat Buchanan, his economic ideas although very foolish would
<BR>
not instantly destroy the economy as Mr. Nader's would and I have no doubt the resulting
<BR>
slow decline in the fortunes of the USA would be blamed on godless foreigners. He just
<BR>
might be able to pull it off. Mr. Buchanan understands TV, has a good hairdo, and he
<BR>
knows how to wave a flag and thump a bible, useful skills for a leader to have when
<BR>
you've totally fucked things up.  Mr. Nader does not have those skills and has a bad
<BR>
haircut so he's less dangerous.
