<EM>&gt;  And while we're on the subject, surely you should move back to Scotland and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  stop oppressing the native Americans.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
That's snippy   ; - ) 
<BR>
<P>Almost not worth responding to, but: 
<BR>
<P>FYI, Junior:
<BR>
<P>There is a fascinating history in North America between the dispossessed 
<BR>
Scottish and the Native Americans, who bonded easily. The Native Americans 
<BR>
had no quarrel with the Scottish, since they had a common tyranny to blame 
<BR>
for their situation. As you might know, Native Americans also were part of 
<BR>
the Underground railroad and helped African Slaves escape, why would they not 
<BR>
sympathize and bond with the Highlanders?
<BR>
<P>Especially in many parts of America and Scotland the stories of submission to 
<BR>
British have striking similarities. ( I am speaking of the Pacific Northwest 
<BR>
tribes of which I am a member, and the Highland and Island clans). Both were 
<BR>
rich and highly socialized hunting and fishing tribes, proud and very land 
<BR>
conscious peoples.
<BR>
The British considered them barbarians and had no moral problem moving their 
<BR>
soldiers in to take whatever they could.
<BR>
<P>Once conquered, the British &quot;assimilated&quot; both nations, and stripped them of 
<BR>
their original culture.  Banned from wearing their tribal costumes; language 
<BR>
outlawed; chieftains and sons killed or de-powered, women and children sent 
<BR>
to &quot;English schools&quot;, forced to move from one place to another until very 
<BR>
little sense of clan, or family or land was present...  
<BR>
<P>Both cultures are victims of massacre and dispossession. 
<BR>
<P>Both survive strongly, while their culture and wealth have been permanently 
<BR>
f**cked up out of their control by a nation who was fond of stealing 
<BR>
everything by force, then backpedaling and trying to make &quot;contracts&quot; and 
<BR>
&quot;treaties&quot; they never kept their side of, which allow just enough property 
<BR>
rights to ease the conscience I suppose, while never allowing the natives to 
<BR>
own their prosperity or land again.
<BR>
<P>When I visited Scotland I was surprised to see a LOT of our totems and 
<BR>
artwork worn proudly on T-shirts, emblems and so forth. I also saw one of the 
<BR>
largest and most beautiful collections of pacific Northwest Indian art at the 
<BR>
Glasgow Museum of Art. 
<BR>
Whereas here in America mostly people think of the Navajo or Plains Indians' 
<BR>
art.
