<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         May 3, 2000

<P>IO'S VOLCANOES SPLATTER DUST INTO THE SOLAR SYSTEM
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiery volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io are the main source of 
<BR>
dust streams that flow from the Jupiter system into the rest of 
<BR>
the solar system, according to new findings from NASA's Galileo 
<BR>
spacecraft analyzed by an international team of scientists.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientists, led by Amara Graps of the Max Planck 
<BR>
Institute of Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany, analyzed the 
<BR>
frequency of dust impacts on Galileo's dust detector subsystem.  
<BR>
They found peaks that coincided with the periods of Io's orbit 
<BR>
(approximately 42 hours) and of Jupiter's rotation (approximately 
<BR>
10 hours).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although dust scientists had suspected Io as the source of 
<BR>
the dust streams, it was difficult to prove.  They ruled out 
<BR>
several possible sources, including Jupiter's main ring and Comet 
<BR>
Shoemaker-Levy 9, but Jupiter's gossamer ring and Io remained as 
<BR>
candidates.  The dust scientists studied several years of Galileo 
<BR>
data to show that the motion of the dust stream particles is 
<BR>
strongly influenced by Jupiter's magnetic field, with a unique 
<BR>
signature that could exist only if Io were the main contributor 
<BR>
to the dust streams.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now, for the first time we have direct evidence that Io is 
<BR>
the dominant source of the Jovian dust streams,&quot; said Graps, lead 
<BR>
author of a paper on the findings that appears in the May 4 issue 
<BR>
of the journal Nature.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jovian dust streams are intense bursts of submicron-
<BR>
sized particles (as small as particles of smoke) that originate 
<BR>
in Jupiter's system and flow out about 290 million kilometers 
<BR>
(180 million miles), or twice the distance between Earth and the 
<BR>
Sun.  They were first discovered in 1992 by the dust detector 
<BR>
onboard the Ulysses spacecraft during its Jupiter flyby.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The escape of dust from the Jovian system in 1992 was a 
<BR>
total surprise,&quot; said Dr. Mihaly Horanyi, a dust plasma physicist 
<BR>
at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, Boulder, CO, 
<BR>
and co-author of the paper.  Since 1995, the Galileo dust 
<BR>
detector, a twin to the Ulysses instrument, has observed the 
<BR>
streams, both while the spacecraft was en route to Jupiter and 
<BR>
within the Jupiter system.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very, very early in the history of our solar system, before 
<BR>
and during the formation of the planets, small dust grains were 
<BR>
much more abundant.  These charged grains were influenced by 
<BR>
magnetic fields from the early Sun, much as the dust on Io is 
<BR>
affected by Jupiter's magnetic field today.  Thus, studies of the 
<BR>
behavior of these dust grains may provide insight into processes 
<BR>
that led to the formation of the moons and planets in our solar 
<BR>
system.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The dust from the Jovian dust streams is clearly 
<BR>
magnetically-controlled dust,&quot; said Dr. Eberhard Gruen of the Max 
<BR>
Planck Institute.  &quot;Dust particles carry information about 
<BR>
charging processes in regions of the Jovian magnetosphere, where 
<BR>
information is otherwise sparse or unknown.&quot; Gruen built the dust 
<BR>
detectors for several spacecraft, including Galileo, Ulysses and 
<BR>
Cassini.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new results provide a useful window on Io.  In-situ 
<BR>
dust measurements can monitor Io's volcanic plume activity, 
<BR>
complementing observations made by Galileo and from Earth-based 
<BR>
telescopes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jovian dust streams, with their Io source, are minor 
<BR>
when compared to the huge amounts of dust created in the solar 
<BR>
system by comet activity and asteroid collisions.  Nonetheless, 
<BR>
they add to the variety of dust sources in the solar system.  In 
<BR>
fact, the Jovian dust streams travel so fast that some particles 
<BR>
can actually leave the solar system to join the local 
<BR>
interstellar medium -- the gas and dust that fill the space 
<BR>
between stars.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2000, during a joint observation of Jupiter by 
<BR>
Galileo and Cassini, scientists will have a unique opportunity to 
<BR>
study the Jovian dust streams using dust instruments on both 
<BR>
spacecraft.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Graps, Gruen and Horanyi, authors on this 
<BR>
paper are Dr. Harald Krueger, Andreas Heck and Sven Lammers of 
<BR>
Max Planck, and Dr. Hakan Svedhem of the European Space Research 
<BR>
and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.  This work 
<BR>
was supported by the German space agency, Deutsches Zentrum fuer 
<BR>
Luft-und Raumfahrt E.V. (DLR).
