Here's some funny electronic countermeasure ideas:  make some device that
<BR>
when plugged into a wall circuit starts throwing lots of white noise into
<BR>
the socket.  Next, have developed a low-power radio frequency emission
<BR>
detector so you can sweep your room, and a low power emitter to bathe your
<BR>
immediate in a wash of radio frequency white noise.  Next is to start
<BR>
bouncing lasers off of any external windows.  Also handy is an audible
<BR>
frequency white noise generator.  Maybe good would be a camera with
<BR>
computer vision that when swept across a field of view picked up any
<BR>
reflections, e.g, from any lenses.  If computer connections are required,
<BR>
you're in particularly bad shape in regards to any privacy.  Start by
<BR>
repurposing some chips that were never planned to be in any
<BR>
realisticdevice, or have your own manufactured.  Then, write or have
<BR>
written a secure operating system.  At this point as soon as its networked
<BR>
its moot, although you might be able to find enough free proxies and
<BR>
anonymous remailers to send and/or receive e-mail.
<BR>
<P>I switch topics to write a little bit about some bill that some flaky
<BR>
members of congress proposed called the &quot;meth lab&quot; bill.  One proviso of
<BR>
this proposed legislation essentially outlaws any material posted with the
<BR>
_intent_ (note emphasis on intent) of breaking some law.  Let me trawl and
<BR>
find the actual text of this bill proviso which is blatantly and likely
<BR>
purposefully Constitutionally infringent.
<BR>
<P>Here is the text of the proposed legislation that prohibits free speech
<BR>
based upon its intent:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(2) PROHIBITION- It shall be unlawful for any person--
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(A) to teach or demonstrate the manufacture of a
<BR>
controlled substance, or to distribute by any means information pertaining
<BR>
to, in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole or in part, the manufacture or use of a controlled
<BR>
substance, with the _intent_ that the teaching, demonstration, or
<BR>
information be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used for, or in furtherance of, an activity that
<BR>
constitutes a Federal crime; or
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(B) to teach or demonstrate to any person the manufacture
<BR>
of a controlled substance, or to distribute to any person, by any means,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information pertaining to, in whole or in part, the
<BR>
manufacture or use of a controlled substance, knowing that such person
<BR>
_intends_ to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the teaching, demonstration, or information for, or in
<BR>
furtherance of, an activity that constitutes a Federal crime.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>About transparency again, I am reminded of some words posted by Lorrey.
<BR>
He says that basically any citizen can arrest and file criminal charges,
<BR>
although they can't give parking tickets.  Well then, it's about time to
<BR>
start grassroots movements to find the corrupt white-collar politicians
<BR>
and bring to bear against them justice.  This isn't the &quot;wild west&quot; posse
<BR>
with a rope after a horse thief, it can be a dynamic group of highly
<BR>
sophisticated citizens who are sick and tired of government malfeasance,
<BR>
with enough legalismo to make it happen, and enough communicative options
<BR>
to share the information about benefits to the citizenry at large.
<BR>
<P>Again about the free speech intent, I figure a good place to start would
<BR>
be if that ugly legislation was put into law.  If that happens, then every
<BR>
single web page that is published by the government could be determined to
<BR>
be in violation of that, and it would be started &quot;People of the United
<BR>
States vs. United States Government.&quot;  Most government published web pages
<BR>
(that is, anything paid for by the taxpayers at large as opposed to
<BR>
individually, corporately, or organizationally) have little to due with
<BR>
any form of chemistry, so anyone could see that it would be a ridiculous
<BR>
lawsuit.  Their intent shall be called.
<BR>
<P>Next would be the activation of a few good software agents to compare all
<BR>
legislative code to practice, and before we know it we would have a stack
<BR>
of subpoenas for many members of government.
<BR>
<P>The positive result:  a stack of legislation that is shown to bad
<BR>
legislation, ready to be stricken at one fell swoop.  The desired end
<BR>
result:  rational and equal protection under law.
<BR>
<P>That leads me to think more about jurimetrics, etcetera, that is,
<BR>
rationalized application of judicial rule.  There is a huge base of code
<BR>
(legal code) not to mention the tax code which is simply ridiculous.  It
<BR>
is certainly so that there is a lot of code because there are many subtle
<BR>
disctinctions to be made, yet by the same token it is so that much of the
<BR>
code what does exist on the books can be seen as invalid or requisite of
<BR>
refit and streamlining to a large degree.  There are skilled jurists who
<BR>
have a good general idea of the entirety of legal code and experts in some
<BR>
of the specific areas, and these can show the artificial intelligence
<BR>
expert systems what to winnow as chaff from the golden rules that are good
<BR>
law.

<P><EM>&gt; We tend to talk about transparent society as tho it is some kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future threat, but let us look at where we are now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I bought a wireless camera and receiver, in order to attach it to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a kite and fly over Mike Lorrey’s house.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; {8^D  Kidding Mike bygones.  I bought one to size up the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threat to privacy posed by these cheap wireless cameras, and determine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their suitability for a wearable.  Here is my short report.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The camera I bought is an 80 dollar model.  It has a wireless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transmitter that has a range of about 30 to 40 meters.  It doesnt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter what stands between the transmitter and receiver.  It needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a 12 volt power supply on both the transmit and receive ends.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The current draw is low enough that it would be useful as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a wearable cam, keeping in mind of course the limited range.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The transmitter unit will fit into a sphere the size of a baseball
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and has a mass of about 170 grams.  The receiver is slightly larger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and slightly heavier.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The device has very good resolution and good color, better than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the security cameras one sees in use today.  The outstanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weakness of this system is it has no means of adjusting for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lighting conditions, and so the picture appears fairly dark in normal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; room light.  In low room light, it becomes functionally useless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So far so good, but heres the part that has me a bit worried: the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; viewer on the transmitter has a plastic light shield that can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; filed off.  If this is done, the light receiver lens is 2.5 mm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diameter (a tenth of an inch).  If someone were to try to hide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of these devices, they would need a space the size of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; baseball, a hole 2.5 mm diameter, and a power source.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nowthen, imagine yourself in a hotel room.  Search all around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for baseball sized places behind something.  Where would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone try to hide one of these devices?  My first guess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be in the TV.  [Shades of Orwell’s 1984, eh?]  One
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could probably pull off a front panel, mount the thing in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there, drill a 2.5 mm hole, tap into the power cord, put it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back together and have a little spy system that the maids
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would neeeeever notice, in fact you and I would have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard time finding it, knowing exactly what we are looking for.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If someone had a spycam mounted in the hotel TV, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could set up the receiver in any room on that hall, or they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could save the cost of a room and set up the receiver and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VCR in a car out in the parking lot.  There would be no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; risk to the person receiving, because there would be no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way for you to figure out where the receiver is located,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it being a passive device.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So.  80 bucks for the camera, 90 bucks gets you a VCR
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these days, and I think a tape is another couple, so 172
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clams plus the cost of at least one night’s room rent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; puts one in the spy business.  Little kids can come up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with that kind of money, and when it comes down to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, that is exactly the kind of person who might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tempted to try such a scheme: the 12-15 crowd.  There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is also the pervert crowd and perhaps an odd blackmailer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or two thrown in.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nowthen, I see four ways to defeat such goings on:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) Search the hotel TV for 2.5 mm diameter holes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2)   Keep the lights in your room low.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3) Turn the TV to face away from whatever you dont
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want the whole world to see,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4) throw a towel or blanket over the TV.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Gives ya the creeps, does it not?  Extropian friends, we must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; face the fact that all technology is not necessarily good, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if it is cool.  We need not speak  of transparent society as something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is coming.  We are already there.   spike
