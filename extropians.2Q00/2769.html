<EM>&gt; &gt; n honor of Mr. Chislenko, I would like to take this opportunity to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  categorically apologize to all who may have been offended or annoyed by any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  of my posts to this list.  The ideas I discussed were heartfelt, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  tone (I admit) could have been more conciliatory.  And for this I apologize.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I also extend the &quot;olive branch&quot; to those who may feel animosity towardme
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  for any of my posts and, in honor of Sasha, I promise to do better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a very responsible move. I had the same thought - and another thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about how about how I'd have felt if someone had been flaming someone online
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and then ve was gone... thanks zero for your considerate words.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, thank you Zero. I feel similarly. From my association with Sasha, I know
<BR>
that he was an adamant champion of individual liberty and personal privacy. He
<BR>
gave up his Soviet citizenship in order to come here back in the late 80's, and
<BR>
he was debating becoming a citizen here, as the INS was encouraging him to become
<BR>
one. We would joke about him being a 'noncitizen of a noncountry', a true &quot;Man
<BR>
Without a Country&quot;. Even though he was thankful for the US accepting him here, he
<BR>
was still opposed to the idea that a person should surrender so much of their
<BR>
freedom and personal productivity to a government merely for the dubious idea
<BR>
that that government 'grants' the individual his liberty, which seems to be the
<BR>
vogue today among so many people, and despite the fact that this idea runs
<BR>
contrary to the Constitution and the Natural Law upon which it is based. That is
<BR>
not to say he was religious at all. He was very much an atheist, so far as I
<BR>
could tell, but he shared with me the idea that Natural Law had its roots in the
<BR>
physical laws of the universe, and how our society has evolved as a result.
<BR>
<P>One thing I think should be put on a list of 'things to do', is in the event that
<BR>
a 'Extropia' sovereign nation is ever founded, that he be given posthumous
<BR>
citizenship, as the first citizen of that nation. It is the least we can do for a
<BR>
man who has done so much for the extropian principles, and I think he would have
<BR>
liked that as well. I know that an extropian nation was one of his favored ideas.
