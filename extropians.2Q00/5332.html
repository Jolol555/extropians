<EM>&gt;From: Max More &lt;<A HREF="mailto:max@maxmore.com?Subject=Re:%20Commie%20Nonsense&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000617072146.81775.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">max@maxmore.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Have you ever traveled to the third world? Do you really think they live in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a free market society? (I dislike the term &quot;capitalist&quot;--the term was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;coined by Karl Marx, who understood nothing about human capital.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Pardon me while I mount my soapbox...
<BR>
<P>I believe Mexico, Jamaica and the Bahamas would qualify.  I've been there 
<BR>
and I've observed squalid poverty in each of those places, and they each 
<BR>
have &quot;free market&quot; societies.  Do I believe these places would be better off 
<BR>
if they were communist?  No.  Again, that is *not* what I'm saying.  I 
<BR>
realize that poverty has myriad causes, historical, social, political and 
<BR>
personal.  *No economic system* can alone eliminate poverty in today's 
<BR>
world.  I realize that.
<BR>
<P>I live in the US.  I love the US.  I am a capitalist.  I am an entrepreneur, 
<BR>
and I enjoy being one.  But, call me a bleeding heart, I feel for those in 
<BR>
the underclass.  It would agonize me to bring my own children up in poverty, 
<BR>
and I don't feel *that* much better about children living in poverty simply 
<BR>
because they are not mine.  I guess what I am saying is I dream a world 
<BR>
where there is no such thing as poverty.  Maybe communism won't make that 
<BR>
dream a reality.  But there is *no question* that capitalism, free market 
<BR>
society, whatever you want to call it, will not do it.
<BR>
<P>Capitalism is Bill Gates.  Capitalism says &quot;Get all that you can for 
<BR>
yourself as soon as possible and by any means necessary.&quot;  Capitalism is a 
<BR>
system where winners prosper to the exclulsion of the losers.  And, to make 
<BR>
it worse, the winners become more likely to win even bigger, while the 
<BR>
losers’ chances of winning slip ever further away.  Microsoft is the perfect 
<BR>
example.  They didn't do anything wrong, except win.  And as they won, they 
<BR>
gained power to continue winning, to the point where they had, in effect, an 
<BR>
insurmountable lead, with a huge monopoly and an ever growing war chest with 
<BR>
which to defend and extend that monopoly.
<BR>
<P>Last year the combined net worth of the world's top 200 richest people rose 
<BR>
$100 billion to over $1 trillion -- twice the entire GNP of Mexico.  *That* 
<BR>
is what capitalism is about.  The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.  
<BR>
That's cool for the rich.  But there's a lot more poor people in the world 
<BR>
than rich people and, frankly, I don't like it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Poverty has multiple causes, not all of which will automatically be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eradicated by free markets. But governments usually make things worse. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;welfare system (especially in Europe) has perpetuated poverty by subidizing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it.
</EM><BR>
<P>There ain’t no subsidization of poverty in Mexico or in Jamaica and, believe 
<BR>
me, there’s plenty of it to go around.  Again, I realize that poverty has 
<BR>
many causes, not the least of which is governmental incompetence and 
<BR>
corruption.  But surely you have to admit that, even in the most efficient 
<BR>
and ethical “free market” states, there is still a great deal of poverty.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;State schooling which stifles competition for good education works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;especially badly in poor neighborhoods. There's a clear correlation between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;degree of education and income (though it's not perfect). Putting some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;competition into the (pre-university school system would immensely help the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;least well off gain real skills that can help them in life. It would also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make my part-time college teaching more fun. I'm frustrated that in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philosophy classes I have to first explain factual basics (whether in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;physics, biology, or finance) before I can even tackle the philosophical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;issues. The United States still has a rigid industrial style of education
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in an information economy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In the &quot;Third World&quot; (an increasingly outdated term), the state is usually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pervasive, or else fails in the job it has taken on of enforcing the rule
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of law, thereby making markets ineffective, and making it hard to get out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of poverty--unless you can become one of the rulers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Free markets are not the whole answer. Some unfortunate people do poorly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because of psychological disorders. Extropians of benevolent disposition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;look forward to a time when medicine has advanced to the point where Prozac
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and Zanax will look as primitive as ECT, and we can truly offer people the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chance to function effectively.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, if you are poor you are either stupid, lazy, crazy or you are ruled by a 
<BR>
kleptocratic despot?  Fact: poverty breeds poverty.  If you are raised in 
<BR>
it, you are likely to stay in it.  The same nation which gave rise to Bill 
<BR>
Gates is home to millions of poor -- white, black and otherwise.  Why is 
<BR>
that?  Are *all* the poor in America lazy, crazy or stupid?  Hint: Bill 
<BR>
Gates was *never* poor.  His daddy was bankrolling a Harvard education for 
<BR>
him before he owned his first piece of Microsoft stock.  How likely do you 
<BR>
think it would be that he would become the world’s first $100 billion man if 
<BR>
his parents were eking out a meager existence in Arkansas as he was growing 
<BR>
up?
<BR>
<P>Capital is consolidating now at an unprecedented pace.  This is great news 
<BR>
if you are in the top 10% of wealthiest people.  Otherwise it is not such 
<BR>
great news.  I don’t want to live in a world where 5% of the population has 
<BR>
as much wealth as the remaining 95%, even if I’m in the top 5%.  Call me 
<BR>
crazy, but that’s just me.  That is the world that capitalism is creating.  
<BR>
I think we can do better.
