<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My fear is that we as a species will not morally evolve fast enough 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to keep up with our technology.  We will be the equivalent of 5 year olds 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who have learned to manufacture sub-machine guns.  Not a pretty picture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know what the solution is, but I'm leaning more and more toward 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leaving the technology in the hands of Big Brother until we as a race are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mature enough to handle it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think this shows one of the major problems in this line of thinking
<BR>
- because if Joe Q. Public is not to be trusted with a nanoassembler,
<BR>
how can we then trust Big Brother? If humans are not morally evolved
<BR>
enough (whatever that means), then the aggregate of humans making up
<BR>
Big Brother is also not likely to be morally evolved enough. And if a
<BR>
maniac with nano gives you bad dreams, then try not to dream about a
<BR>
nasty Big Brother with nano.
<BR>
<P>There is also another problem here, and that is that &quot;moral evolution&quot;
<BR>
(whatever that is; I agree that we have seen a trend the last
<BR>
centuries towards more human-friendly and &quot;nice&quot; moralities, but that
<BR>
is no proof of an obgoing evolution towards something &quot;good&quot; and might
<BR>
just be my own particular prejudices talking) might not be
<BR>
enough. Imagine a world of saints, and one maniac with doomsday nano -
<BR>
you get the same problem regardless of the average ethical standing of
<BR>
people as long as the product of avaoilable destructiveness times the
<BR>
amount of people times the fraction dangerous lunatics becomes large
<BR>
enough. To remain safe, you need to keep down the technology, which
<BR>
seems very hard to do, keep down the population, which might be doable
<BR>
but for other reasons, or keep the fraction lunatics as low as
<BR>
possible, which is likely even harder than keeping control over
<BR>
technology. After all, you can be a dangerous lunatic without knowing
<BR>
it or being apparent to others. 
<BR>
<P>As I see it, this dilemma is important. It is maybe one of the most
<BR>
worrying socio-philosophical problems of transhumanism. Banning
<BR>
dangerous technologies seldom works, at least for those that require
<BR>
sufficiently small investments to develop. Big Brother is not a viable
<BR>
option because of the risk of abuse.  Non-human regulatory systems
<BR>
like the nanarchy idea debated in the Good Old Days on this list has
<BR>
the same problem. It is not clear that balancing a powerful enough BB
<BR>
with a transparent society of little brothers is
<BR>
possible. Self-regulation probably works better than most people
<BR>
realise, but only against threats that do not wipe out the whole
<BR>
system the first time they are used. 
<BR>
<P>Probably the only viable solution is to make sure the system can
<BR>
survive huge disasters, that makes these disasters something that can
<BR>
be handled at least partially. Space colonisation is a good first
<BR>
step, but currently too expensive to do as a security precaution. With
<BR>
enough nano it is cheaper and viable, but then we have a window of
<BR>
opportunity between the development of space-applicable nano and the
<BR>
sufficient spread of dangerous technology to make catastrophic
<BR>
destruction likely whose width is hard to estimate. 
<BR>
<P>Making people saner, putting safeguards into place, having an open
<BR>
debate about issues and applying the technology for protection (such
<BR>
as active shields for nano) might not be enough, but it buys us time
<BR>
and maneouvering room.
