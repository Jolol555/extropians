<BR>
<P>I certainly see this on the list!!  Many of us(including me) like to post 
<BR>
links and messages about the latest luddite/religious/political group which 
<BR>
is threatening the Extropian agenda!  We must hold back the forces which

threaten the oncoming of the singularity our our own individual posthuman

If someone made an anti-Semitic comment, that was clearly not in the least 
<BR>
representative, and has nothing to do with Extropian thinking. The way you 
<BR>
say this, you irresponsibly give the impression that this is representative 
<BR>
or normal. As for &quot;reactionary men's movement&quot;, I presume
<BR>
you are referring to the views of one or two people out of the hundreds on 
<BR>
the list. Again, that has nothing to do with Extropian transhumanism.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I totally agree.  Bryan is saying that like it or not, the posts by people 
<BR>
on the extro list do to a certain extent come across as representing the 
<BR>
movement.  I see his point.
<BR>
<P>Alex Bokov
<BR>
I'm always tempted to say &quot;Well, let's settle
<BR>
this through a contest, people. Whichever ideology builds the first
<BR>
base on Mars, or revives the first cryonaut, or builds the first
<BR>
general purpose nanoassembler... that is the one that gets my vote.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Alex, so you are going to be giving your vote to centrist Republicans? ;)

<BR>
If permitted a reductionist psychological approach, one might find
<BR>
that the entire Extropic standpoint is a reaction formation. In my
<BR>
recollection, an Extropian does nothing if not protest too much.
<BR>
Reminds me of Raskolnakov and the decrepit crone Lisaveta whom
<BR>
he beat to death to prove he was not &quot;a stop in an organ&quot; [in the
<BR>
words of the Beetle-Man]. As the French say, after a revolution,
<BR>
everything's the same.&quot;
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I can see the Extropian principles in a way as a protest or &quot;reaction&quot; 
<BR>
against some of the maladies of our time such as anti-science bias, disease, 
<BR>
aging, oppressive gov't, etc..  There is alot to stand up and fight against! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think it definitely goes beyond that with a focus on 
<BR>
self-improvement and personal liberty(I did not say libertarian!).
<BR>
<P>I agree that extropians like to complain about the state of things with 
<BR>
endless posts!  I am one of those people though! lol  Aren't there good 
<BR>
reasons for people wanting to do that?  I realize action by capable and 
<BR>
educated extropians to change things is better than everyone simply griping 
<BR>
about our state.  Or am I missing a meaning here which Robert is making?  I 
<BR>
think I am.  I often found Robert's posts needing a second or third reading 
<BR>
to grasp the full meaning.  &quot;You doth protest to much?&quot; hmmm

<P>Max wrote:
<BR>
Robert, I know that you had some vigorous  disagreement with people on the 
<BR>
Extropians list, but just because people  disagree with you some of the time 
<BR>
hardly justifies this &quot;reaction  formation&quot; nonsense. I found many of your 
<BR>
posts on the Extropians list to be stimulating and well thought-out, even 
<BR>
when I disagreed (which I recall seemed to be often). When I disagreed with 
<BR>
you, I never felt the need to accuse you of some psychological malady.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I very much miss having Robert on the list.  His statement to me is not an

insult regarding extropian concepts but instead a perspective he is throwing

we would be dishonoring ourselves by NOT pursuing it.

I disagree completely. This is perhaps part of why the question

of the libertarian nature of Extropianism has a different

valence for you. (The fact that you put it as &quot;FREEDOM of

self-augmentation,&quot; instead of &quot;self-augmentation,&quot; is telling.)

<P>The two of you do seem to see things very differently.  I can easily see

governments heavily restricting attempts by common citizens to augment

approach to giving individual citizens freedom to at least an extent.

do with anti-Semitism) -- but rather to point out

trends in the Extropians _list membership_ that I find disturbing.

very GOOD thing.  I personally thank you.

<BR>
When I first thought about it, I kept thinking, indeed, the
<BR>
charge amounts to Jewish paranoia, but I no longer think that.
<BR>
It has at least three components. 1. Anti-Semitism is the best
<BR>
explanation for the irrationality of the eternally recurring
<BR>
circumcision discussions (in these discussions, medical
<BR>
evidence, as I've assessed it, is not adduced rationally). 2.
<BR>
Things Jewish have more than once been referred to as funny or
<BR>
odd or something (though of course not &quot;evil,&quot; or &quot;sucking
<BR>
shit&quot;). At least twice, for example, a Jewish name was referred
<BR>
to as funny or odd or something along these lines (a reference
<BR>
to Ayn Rand's birth name, &quot;Alice Rosenbaum,&quot; was one example
<BR>
that I recall offhand); 3. Far more interestingly (though
<BR>
perhaps not relevantly), the case has been made that
<BR>
libertarianism itself is anti-Semitic (the argument is
<BR>
tortuously complex, but revolves around an equation of attempts
<BR>
to avoid the Law [as in &quot;People of The Law&quot;] with attempts to
<BR>
avoid governmental control. Very long story.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Whew!... some interesting points to say the least.  1.  Perhaps in our day 
<BR>
blatant anti-semitism is often not allowed so some people(perhaps 
<BR>
unconsciously even) just barely hint at it.  Circumcision is often seen as a 
<BR>
uniquely jewish topic even though it is not.  That medical reasons for it 
<BR>
were not given is interesting.  Tone, topic and facts to back it up DO 
<BR>
matter.
<BR>
<P>2.  I have picked up on things jewish being referred to as funny or odd.  I 
<BR>
remember my mind being &quot;pricked&quot; numerous times but than letting the matter 
<BR>
go.  These were all on the surface at least very minor things, but still...
<BR>
<P>3.  I never heard this before!  I am now thinking about the post Mike Lorrey 
<BR>
wrote!  I think what he says applies here.  Mike is there anyplace you won't 
<BR>
go? lol  I am glad you made us aware of this matter.  I personally had no 
<BR>
idea.  I have heard there is major jewish scholarship in methods and shades 
<BR>
of anti-semitism.  I can see how jews being &quot;people of the law&quot; and having 
<BR>
been persecuted so horribly over the centuries would want strong(but just) 
<BR>
governments in place where they live so their rights would be respected.  
<BR>
Libertarianism could create an environment of vulnerability for jewish 
<BR>
people and culture should persecution arise without central authority to 
<BR>
squash it.

<P>Brian wrote:
<BR>
I find, in a sense, the strongest argument, but, in another
<BR>
sense, the least relevant. If libertarianism is anti-Semitic in
<BR>
this way, then it is anti-Semitic in such an indirect way that
<BR>
th strongest argument one could make about Extropianism and
<BR>
anti-Semitism is simply that Extropianism partakes more than
<BR>
most movements in a mentality that might have historical
<BR>
parallels with anti-Semitism. That's a pretty thin connection,
<BR>
though I think it's there (but it simply isn't the sort of
<BR>
connection that would justify the claim that this or that
<BR>
Extropian person is an anti-Semite).
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Brian, thank you for saying at the end it is a thin connection and would not

justify the claim that the Extropian Institute is anti-semitic.

But in reviewing my thoughts on this, I realize I put the

anti-Semitism claim too strongly (because too unqualifiedly),

for which I apologize (though if #3 is correct, then, given that
<BR>
Extropianism is essentially libertarian -- I will continue to
<BR>
believe this until see the case that a non-libertarian position
<BR>
is articulated that doesn't violate the Principles --
<BR>
Extropianism is anti-Semitic, but, again, not in a way that
<BR>
isn't shared by most of U.S. culture). It should be more like,

&quot;there are clear, not infrequent signs of (subtle) anti-Semitism
<BR>
on the Extropians list.&quot;

<P>You got it right with the last final statement.  And we need to work on

that, but at the same time let people say what they want to even if they're

You don't seem &quot;to have ears&quot; for this discussion (to speak

<P>I feel Max is to an extent oversimplifying here and yet IS showing how 
<BR>
really this is not a major problem on the extro list.  Shades of 
<BR>
anti-semitism are there, but than real people(sometimes prejudiced) in the 
<BR>
real world are writing the posts.  Again, Brian has made us more aware of 
<BR>
things and we can all be more on our toes.  A good thing.

As for libertarianism being inherently anti-Semitic, this is laughable. You 
<BR>
mentioned Ayn Rand as someone many Extropians like (though many also
<BR>
strongly dislike her work, or parts of it). She is of Jewish background. So 
<BR>
are numerous leading libertarian thinkers, such as Murray Rothbard and 
<BR>
Israel Kirzner. Come on, Brian, you're really off-base here. The fact that 
<BR>
you would try to stretch an already-incredible statement about libertarians 
<BR>
to smear Extropians with anti-Semitism does make me think that either you  
<BR>
are deliberately slandering Extropians, or else you have some paranoia about 
<BR>
the issue.

<P>More good points from Max.  While people are capable of self-hatred based on 
<BR>
race I just don't see how it truly applies here.  But I do realize(and you 
<BR>
carefully tread in explaining) you were really just making us aware of a 
<BR>
&quot;fringe&quot; or at the edges theory of anti-semitism by telling us about how 
<BR>
libertarianism could be interpreted as against &quot;the people of the law.&quot;  You 
<BR>
would say in closing that the Extropian Institute and it's principles were 
<BR>
NOT anti-semitic.  I think I grok you.

<P>And I hope this thread continues as long as it stays meaningful.  Max

allowed you to speak freely on the extro list.  You were banned.  Brian, you

are one of the shining lights here.

Very true. And one that fails to defend itself against false charges is

vulnerable to serious damage.

<BR>
<P>Yes, very true.  I hope we can in future all better try to grasp what the 
<BR>
other person is trying to state without getting overly sensitive and 
<BR>
critical.  But than emotions are in my view an integral part of the 
<BR>
intellect.

How, then, are those individuals who wish to augment themselves to do
<BR>
so in a purely market-driven environment such as libertarianism
<BR>
aspires to? A &quot;moral right&quot; should not be subject to the whims of
<BR>
free market capitalism. Do I have a right to be secure in my home and
<BR>
my property only if I can afford a high wall and moat around my home?
<BR>
A moral right which only the wealthy are able to exercise is no right
<BR>
at all.

<P>That is a scary scenario!  I want a world with vastly more personal freedom, 
<BR>
but also where through rule of law people are protected and cared for.

Getting there will be quite a challenge to say the least.

The mere fact that we can have a discussion like this about our

differences, without rancor, is testament to that strength.

<P>Very true!  Honestly, we are all very fortunate to have a man of Max More's

caliber leading us.  I am grateful to him(don't get a swelled head Max!).

Far more importantly, to me, is that the generally right-wing
<BR>
nature of Extropians is a fascinating phenomenon, given the
<BR>
growing popularity of Extropianism. It raises interesting
<BR>
sociological and political questions.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>It will be interesting to see how the Extropian Institute and it's 
<BR>
membership develop over the next fifty years!  As &quot;The First Immortal&quot; novel 
<BR>
claimed, in the future membership may be in the hundreds of millions!!!  How 
<BR>
the political orientation will have evolved by than will be quite the thing 
<BR>
to watch... and influence.

Because so many Extropians are educated less in the humanities
<BR>
than the sciences, it may be difficult to discuss this question
<BR>
fruitfully here. We'd have to discuss at least a bit of Luther,
<BR>
if not the early Church Fathers. And for many here that might
<BR>
involve a lot of tedious reading of dusty texts.
<BR>
<P>And who the Hell wants to do that?! Once we stop aging, we can
<BR>
get to philosophy, history and such. :)
<BR>
<P>(Of course, there won't be Judaism anymore at that point,
<BR>
because the big hyper ai-unity will have sucked up everything
<BR>
into itself, and thus there'll never be a minion.)

<P>Brian, now you should like an oldtime Extropian! ;)  Immortality and super

AI overminds is what we like most to talk about! lol

If we are to discuss political and economic differences among

transhumanists, why not take the emphasis away from general criticisms and

instead ask which specific policies and procedures will best further our

shared transhumanist goals while respecting our personal values?

<P>Yes, constructive work toward dealing with the matters discussed here is the 
<BR>
best way to go.  Rather than being split apart by differences and rude

words, we need to reach out to eachother, not always agreeing but at least 
<BR>
trying to see the other's view.
