<EM>&gt; ... And that's an interesting problem. Why aren't we baught by &quot;The New

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is because transhumanism has utterly failed to show a professional face to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the industry. You don't invest in geeks, geeks cannot defend you.

<P>Not everyone in the industry shares our views.  But, you're right, it is
<BR>
an interesting problem.  What kind of business models could one create
<BR>
to turn our particular dreams into reality?  I know of a few myself (for
<BR>
instance, there's a professor who came up with a business plan to
<BR>
bootstrap lunar industry into existence; too bad he's content to just
<BR>
use it to teach a course, rather than trying to get funding and turn it
<BR>
into reality), as well as numerous non-profit prize foundations (prizes
<BR>
for nano, the X Prize, et cetera).
<BR>
<P>In particular, I wonder if one could come up with a single buisiness
<BR>
that profitably covered all aspects of transhumanism?  It'd be easy
<BR>
enough to focus on, say, just access to space, or just nanoassemblers,
<BR>
or just human augmentation (though I haven't heard of too many doing
<BR>
that last one), but could one do them all and still turn the profit it
<BR>
would need to survive?
