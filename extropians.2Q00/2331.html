<P>&lt;&lt; The problem is the definition of &quot;crime&quot;. When any action that has no harm 
<BR>
&nbsp;to another person is labeled a &quot;crime&quot;, then surveillance becomes 
<BR>
&nbsp;tyrannical. We can look forward (for example) to smokers being fined by 
<BR>
&nbsp;mail, and as was stated earlier, a final breakdown of the &quot;innocent until 
<BR>
&nbsp;proven guilty&quot; principle.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, last fall I got two tickets because the police checked my license 
<BR>
plate number and found me on a list of people that had no liability 
<BR>
insurance.  They came very close together.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice I hauled my insurance cards out a demostrated that I had conformed 
<BR>
to the law.  (like a lot of people I don't clean out my glove box in a timely 
<BR>
fashion so I had quite a collection of insurance cards)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice I got a ticket anyway.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice I went into court with a letter from the relevant authority saying 
<BR>
I was innocent.  I had never been without insurance.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice the Judges sat there with the evidence before them and tried to 
<BR>
angle me into admitting guilt even though there was no prosecuting evidence 
<BR>
against me.  &quot;No your Honor, I have received no other tickets.&quot;  &quot;No, your 
<BR>
Honor there are no dents or scrapes on my car.  It hasn't even been washed.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes, in this jurisdiction driving without libility insurance carries a 
<BR>
hefty fine.
