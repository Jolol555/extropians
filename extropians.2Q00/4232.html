</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; old men to leer at people while they are in various states of undress 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the privacy of their own homes.  Perverts will be perverts, but I can't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their behavior ever getting the sanction of law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Whats all this about it being against the law Zero? I thought you don't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anyone has a right to privacy, so it CAN&quot;T be against the law, by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;definition.
</EM><BR>
<P>I said you don’t have a right to privacy *in public*.  I never said you 
<BR>
don’t have a right to privacy in your bedroom.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Sure, once tiny and powerful surveillance technology is in the hands of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; masses we will all be vulnerable to the inquisitive and prurient 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of our neighbors.  But the same tech that threatens us will also be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; protect us.  It is, of course, a double edged sword.  So you watched me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lounging in the nude last night?  Well guess what?  Someone watched you,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; watching me and now *you're* going to jail.  Nyah, nyah.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not everyone can watch everyone else all the time. Those who do unpleasant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;things or are unpleasant people will likely be watched much less than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pleasant people will be watched by unpleasant people. Thus it is only a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;risk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that such people will be watched at any given time.
</EM><BR>
<P>People, for the foreseeable future, will break the law.  We can’t stop 
<BR>
people from shooting and killing innocent people on the streets.  We will 
<BR>
probably not be able to keep “unpleasant” people from doing unpleasant 
<BR>
things with surveillance technology.  But I don’t think we should relinquish 
<BR>
surveillance tech any more than you think we should relinquish firearms.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Good morning  Jim.. we all saw you materbating on camera last night.. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;this is not good for our corporate image, your terminated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1.  You broke the law by spying on me while I was, er, &quot;massaging&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;myself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What law is that? If there is a law against violating a person's privacy, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what are all these cameras for? Using your logic, if there is a law 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;protecting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your privacy, then there is no need for cameras that violate your privacy.
</EM><BR>
<P>First, the cameras exist.  Second, the cameras are getting smaller and 
<BR>
better all the time.  The only way to stop that is to criminalize the 
<BR>
development, possession or use of small surveillance tech.  What are the 
<BR>
cameras for?  Because people want them.  I can’t wait until there is a 
<BR>
camera unobtrusive enough that I can comfortably wear it and with enough 
<BR>
available storage that I can record my entire day, and every conversation 
<BR>
and transaction I make.  I want it for *me*.  I have a feeling I’m not the 
<BR>
only one.
<BR>
<P>Just because we have nifty tech, though, doesn’t mean that laws prohibiting 
<BR>
illegal behavior governing the use of that tech will be repealed.  So, let 
<BR>
me turn the tables on you.  Using *your* logic, since there *are* laws 
<BR>
prohibiting things like hiding cameras in dressing rooms and posting the 
<BR>
video on the net, we should destroy all video cameras and dismantle the 
<BR>
internet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 2.  Firing me for doing things on my own time which are not illegal is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; against the law.  So now, I will wait til the $billion IPO and sue the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bejesus out of the company for invasion of privacy, wrongful 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;termination,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; intentional infliction of emotional distress and any number of federal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;civil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rights violations and...job?  I don't need no stinkin' job!  Thanks a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bunch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; boss!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Firing you is only illegal if you have not signed a contract to that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;With ubiquitous surveillance, employers, government bureaucracies, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parties will all mandate that their top people sign contracts that they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;engage in un-PC behavior. Once the public sees how well such clauses keep 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Slick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Willy and his kind in check, such requirements will spread to more and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;occupations, just as drug tests have done. Violating that contract, even on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;own time, means termination.
</EM><BR>
<P>The courts have held that firing someone for legal off-work activity is a 
<BR>
violation of their civil rights and contrary to public policy.  You would be 
<BR>
foolish to agree to give your employer the right to violate your civil 
<BR>
rights, and even if you did, the contract would be probably void as against 
<BR>
public policy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Hey George.. we should have Insta-patented that idea we discused last 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;night
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;over a few beers.. Suzie has just stolen the whole deal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yeah Bob, but good thing for us our whole conversation was recorded, as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as the fact that Suzie was listening in.  All we have to do is submit 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; data to the Patent Office and her patent never gets issued.  Or better 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yet,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we could just sit back and see if the idea actually works.  If so, we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wait til the $billion IPO and sue the bejesus out of her for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with prospective business advantage, unfair competition, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;misappropriation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; trade secrets, commercial espionage and...idea?  We don't need no 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stinkin'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; idea!  Thanks a bunch Suzie!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If there is no privacy, then there is no misappropriation. Your ideas are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;domain as soon as they leave your brain. Heck, I'll bet once surveillance 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;proves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to not work well on detering crime, you'll want to put mind taps on people.
</EM><BR>
<P>Personally I think it would be a boon to society if all expressed ideas were 
<BR>
public domain.  If that were the case there would be no way for Suzie to 
<BR>
patent Bob and George’s idea in the first place, right?  Then it would come 
<BR>
down to who was able to best implement the idea.  But since there is so much 
<BR>
money in proprietary intellectual property, I don’t see the public domain 
<BR>
scenario being implemented anytime soon.  As long as there is legally 
<BR>
protectable intellectual property, it will be illegal to misappropriate 
<BR>
other people’s trade secrets.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Knock Knock. hello!!! We noticed YOU use this non biodegradable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tampon..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;please have a free sample of our green friendly tampon !
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hey thanks!  It's free *and* green?  Just what I was looking for.  I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; really glad you were able to anticipate my needs like that!  Sure beats 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; days when I had to go the the market and hunt up and down the aisle for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the right kind of widget.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you go back to use  those bad tampons after your free sample is used up 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will be publicly excoriated for not being sensitive to the environment.
</EM><BR>
<P>So?  Some people are publicly excoriated for getting abortions, or wearing 
<BR>
fur, or being gay, or being black.  That is not a surveillance problem.  
<BR>
That is a societal problem.  Yet it hasn’t stopped people from getting 
<BR>
abortions or wearing fur or being gay or being black (er, except Michael 
<BR>
Jackson).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Damnit I'm sick of never getting a &quot;date&quot; because my penis is too 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;small..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Why cant they get to know me first!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Would you really be interested in someone who would not date you because 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that?  Would you really be interested in someone who would *break the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;law*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and violate your privacy to find that out about you?  If you are that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; desperate, chances are you would never get a date no matter how big you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Tell me, who do you think attracts more women? Pee-Wee Herman or Woody 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Allen?
</EM><BR>
<P>Have no idea.  None of the women I’ve had relationships with would be 
<BR>
interested in either.
