<P><EM>        &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;The John Clark of yesterday no longer exists, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;remember being him so in my opinion he has survived.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;This sounds a bit like history being written by the victors, and has
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;similar problems!!
</EM><BR>
<P>This &quot;problem&quot; has never caused the slightest trouble to anyone, even
<BR>
though it happens to everyone every day of their lives. Why should it start
<BR>
causing problems now? If an example of death is the thing that happened
<BR>
to the John Clark of yesterday then I don't care if I &quot;die&quot; when I go through
<BR>
the transporter. In fact I'd be absolutely delighted to discover that I'm dead
<BR>
because that would mean death was not all it was cracked up to be.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Nice analogy. But you *could* trace some kind of trajectory for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;wave in general. Ditto for macroscopic humans.
</EM><BR>
<P>If so then you could also plot the trajectory from &quot;The Original&quot; to &quot;The Copy&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;What seems important to you is that the PATTERN is retained; I agree
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;with this.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm glad to hear that because if it's not the atoms and it's not the space-time
<BR>
line and it's not the pattern either then it must be a religious type soul.
<BR>
if I believed that I'd sell my science books shave my head and buy a spiffy
<BR>
new wardrobe of saffron robes from monksRus.com
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; But 1.) The PATTERN itself must be transcribed for transmission
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; AFAIK.  Does this change in the medium matter?
</EM><BR>
<P>Does the meaning of this message change depending on whether it
<BR>
was recorded on a hard disk or a floppy?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; (a) 2 copies of a computer file may well be structurally and
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; functionally identical (I'm perfectly happy to agree with this)
</EM><BR>
<P>And I'm perfectly happy with a consciousness that functions identically
<BR>
with my own because then it is my own, that's exactly what I mean by &quot;me&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>       &gt;but NOT in the sense (b) That they inhabit the same space or time
</EM><BR>
<P>Who cares? Making your consciousness survive is just another task, and
<BR>
not every aspect of everything is relevant in accomplishing a task. I'll bet
<BR>
you didn't need to open up your computer and note the color of the wires
<BR>
in its power supply before you could use it to reply intelligently to my post.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;our programs are on our respective hard discs.
</EM><BR>
<P>And if you erase your program by accident I can send you a copy of
<BR>
mine, you could even put it on the exact same sectors of your hard disk
<BR>
if you were the excessive compulsive type. What has been lost?
<BR>
