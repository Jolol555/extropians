<P>
Ok, I've done some research and will try to point out some of
<BR>
the problems with claims being made on this thread.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From Dan:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Interestingly, it has recently been demonstrated that we live in an open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universe consisting of roughly 5% matter, 35% dark matter, and 60% dark
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe this is from a commentary by Joel Primack, based on an article
<BR>
by Eric Gawiser, Joseph Silk, Science 280: pgs 1397-1411 (several articles).
<BR>
<P>The Primack quote:
<BR>
&quot;best agrees with the data is a model in which the universe is made
<BR>
&nbsp;of 70% cold dark matter, 20% hot dark matter, and 10% ordinary matter.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Gawiser &amp; Silk:
<BR>
&quot;The combination of detections of anisotropy in cosmic microwave
<BR>
&nbsp;background radiation and observations of the large-scale distribution
<BR>
&nbsp;of galaxies probes the primordial density fluctuations of the universe
<BR>
&nbsp;on spatial scales varying by three orders of magnitude. These data are
<BR>
&nbsp;found to be inconsistent with the predictions of several popular
<BR>
&nbsp;cosmological models. Agreement between the data and the cold + hot
<BR>
&nbsp;dark matter model, however, suggests that a significant fraction of the
<BR>
&nbsp;matter in the universe may consist of massive neutrinos.&quot;
<BR>
<P>(a) If a fraction of the galaxies evolves life early and consumes the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;material, going &quot;dark&quot;, the &quot;large-scale distribution of galaxies&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*and* the cosmic microwave background &quot;fluctuations&quot; may be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;misinterpreted.  So *both* data sets on whigh the conclusions
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are base require a dead universe.
<BR>
<P>(b) I haven't seen any evidence from physics experiments suggesting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that massive neutrinos (hot dark matter) exist.
<BR>
<P>The last sentence of this paper:
<BR>
&quot;If the rapidly improving Type Ia supernovae observations follow current trends
<BR>
&nbsp;there may be enough statistical power in the direct observations of cosmological
<BR>
&nbsp;parameters to make OCDM and Lambda-CDM preferred to CHDM, although in that case
<BR>
&nbsp;none of these models would be a satisfactory fit to both the supernovae and
<BR>
&nbsp;structure formation observations.&quot;
<BR>
<P>So even they admit current obervational trends would contradict their
<BR>
conclusions and *none* of the models seem to be able to reconcile all
<BR>
of the obervational data.  (This article is ~2 years old *and* the
<BR>
supernova data in published works did continue the observational hints
<BR>
of that time -- though I've been told by a scientist from JPL that there
<BR>
are were questions about the SN Type Ia conclusions).
<BR>
<P>On Mon, 15 May 2000 <A HREF="mailto:Spudboy100@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Recreating%20people%20[was:%20renaissance%20people]&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.UW2.4.20.0005151626420.21120-100000@www.aeiveos.com&gt;">Spudboy100@aol.com</A> wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes indeed, I am aware of the new discoveries recently in measuring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; background radiation and its rammifications.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll simply note that the de Bernadis paper in nature (27 April, 2000, p 955)
<BR>
says within the 95% confidence interval, omega_0 is 0.88 &lt; 0 &lt; 1.12.
<BR>
That is not &quot;proof&quot; for a flat universe, only a suggestion.
<BR>
<P>More importantly, again the last sentences of the paper:
<BR>
&quot;Our data clearly show the presence of power beyond the peak at l = 197,
<BR>
&nbsp;corresponding to smaller-scale structures. The consequences of this fact
<BR>
&nbsp;will be fully analysed elsewhere.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I've seen at least one comment that those &quot;smaller scale structures&quot;
<BR>
conflict with most of the theories.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There jury isn't out and may not be out for centuries; but yes it does appear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be expanding at a faster rate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only if the Type Ia SN data holds up.  Given the suspicions that are
<BR>
building that we are missing a proper accounting for the heavy elements
<BR>
there is no telling how SN Ia brightnesses should vary as they become
<BR>
more distant (and therefore from &quot;younger&quot; universe eras).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;Andrew Weil&quot; suggested in his book, The Age of Spiritual Machines,
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you mean &quot;Ray Kurzweil&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; that whatever the Constants of the Universe are; it won't matter,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because whenever these constants come up against Intelligence,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these constants effectively crumble.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hardly.  Kurzweil is a bright guy and a good programmer but that
<BR>
hardly qualifies him to prognosticate that we (or SIs) can change the
<BR>
laws of the universe.  In fact if you read in detail all of the work
<BR>
being done on keeping Moores Law going, it becomes clear that
<BR>
we *are* getting closer and closer to the limits.  And as I
<BR>
point out in my MBrain discussions, the speed of light places
<BR>
a fundamental limit on who &quot;smart&quot; you can get.  Planck sizes
<BR>
place fundamental limits on how small you can get.  Gravity
<BR>
places fundamental limits on how dense you can get before you
<BR>
*disappear* from this universe.
