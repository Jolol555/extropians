<P>I believe that was Chevron in Nigeria.  WBAI did an expose on it.

<P><EM>&gt;or the slash and burn farming cartels in south america ?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm unfamiliar with that example, though Pacific Fruit had a long history of

paramilitary operations in Latin America.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;examples of companies 'oppressing' people by sending men with guns to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;murder the opposition.
</EM><BR>
<P>This does happen, to be sure, but the cases where it does happen are
<BR>
peripheral and unlikely to happen in a developed nation especially if the
<BR>
citizenry is well armed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Government/Business - only difference is the amount of power they can
</EM><BR>
wield.
<BR>
<P>True, though I would say that to the degree a business uses force, it is no
<BR>
longer acting as a business on a free market, but is becoming the equivalent
<BR>
of a government -- whether it be small time like a local mob or big time
<BR>
like bankrolling a coup or a revolution.
<BR>
<P>But I think what Billy Brown was getting at was something like this.
<BR>
Yesterday, I visited a friend of mine in Brooklyn.  We went out to eat and
<BR>
checked several restaurants before settling on a Thai place over on Park
<BR>
Slope.  We even went into two before settling on that one.  At no time did
<BR>
anyone chase us down the street or threaten our very lives.  You just don't
<BR>
have that kind of exit power with governments.  (Yeah, sure, one can move to
<BR>
Canada if one doesn't like the US, but it's just not the same.)
<BR>
<P>Also, government is defined basically by its ability to use force,
<BR>
specifically in a given area.  A government that does not use force is like
<BR>
a tiger without teeth and claws.  (This is ignoring, for the moment, when
<BR>
and how a government should use force -- or whether there should be
<BR>
governments at all.)  When Chevron helped to attack villagers in Nigeria, it
<BR>
was acting as a government would.  It was able to do this because, for the
<BR>
most part, the Nigerian government is too busy trying to consolidate its
<BR>
power (parts of the country want to secede) and it's extremely corrupt.  (If
<BR>
Chervon had tried the same tactics in, say, Japan or Iran, in contradiction
<BR>
to the governments there, what do you think would've happened?  If Chevron
<BR>
didn't get the help of another government, chances are it would lose and
<BR>
lose face.)
