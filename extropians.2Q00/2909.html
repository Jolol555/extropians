<EM>&gt; &gt; I would never, ever suggest that this logic ought to apply to anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; other than myself.  There is absolutely nothing morally wrong about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cryonics.  There is absolutely nothing morally wrong about saving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; your own life with your own money.  But, by a similar token, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is absolutely nothing morally wrong with choosing to say that your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; own life is no more important than anyone else's.  It's my choice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've made it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Do you realize that this choice will make everyone that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remains after you're gone suffer as much as we are all now suffering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now that Sasha is gone?  If sasha had not failed to have himself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preserved, how much better would we all feel right know!?  Cryonic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preservation isn't just for those that die!  It must also be seen as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making it easear for those that would otherwise have to spend billions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of years or more missing you and trying to bring you back without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a corpsickle to work with.

<P>Moreover Eli, this is one thing you don't get a vote in deciding, how
<BR>
important you are. Of course the rest of us can't and shouldn't try to
<BR>
force it on you either, but, dammit, I know a lot about shutting
<BR>
yourself off from others. You might say I'm an ace at it. If the rest of
<BR>
use decide you ARE important (and I think thats already been established
<BR>
pretty well), then it is your responsibility to consider that. I know
<BR>
this is probably unexpected for me to say this, but thats how it is.
