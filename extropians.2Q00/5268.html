<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm a willing capitalist now.  But there are many in our society who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; have my luck and/or ability.  Some of them live at a level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;subsistence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; which IMO is beneath that fit for a human.  That saddens me.  I believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; someday we'll be able to do better.  That's *all* I was saying.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Such people are the way they are because they buy the lie that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;deserve more than what they've got, that they should not have to work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for it. It saddens me that purportedly intelligent people like you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;continue to give such failed ideas credence, which condemns generations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of millions of people to lives of squalor, hate, resentment, and failure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;because they are programmed to beleive the lie you give credence to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you actually believe that capitalism can provide the means to universally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eradicate poverty?  That if every &quot;lazy, stupid&quot; etc. poor person &quot;got off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their lazy ass&quot; they could live a life of abundance?  Have you *ever*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traveled to the third world?  Can you possibly believe that the only reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some people are poor is because they are &quot;programmed&quot; to believe the lie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they cannot live any other way?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Compared to Lorrey economics, the Lorrey drive looks downright feasible ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>Its a capitalist society that creates your fabled  utopia of
<BR>
nano-technological freedom from want, and it will be a libertarian one
<BR>
at that, because as it is now, governments are only interested in nano
<BR>
for weapons, and don't want to give the common person access to the
<BR>
technology for daily needs, then you must also beleive that 'capitalism
<BR>
can provide the means'. What is it you don't understand about the fact
<BR>
that more people live at a much higher standard of living where
<BR>
capitalism is king than in any other nation? Capitalism is obviously
<BR>
doing a much better job than your Marxism.
