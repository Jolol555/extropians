<P>
Friends this one is kinda long, but may be one of the
<BR>
more worthwhile things I have posted in a while.
<BR>
<P>Allow me to turn this NMD debate by asking a question.
<BR>
<P>If the argument is over the current non-feasibility of a national missile
<BR>
defense, what future technologies can we imagine that would make
<BR>
such a thing possible?  What are we still missing?  Note I am not
<BR>
arguing if such a thing *should* be done, I am asking what do
<BR>
we need to make it happen?
<BR>
<P>Heres a personal experience.  In 1971, a young Stanford PhD
<BR>
came to work at Lockheed in Sunnyvale.  His doctorate was
<BR>
in the then-new field of digital feedback and control theory.  He
<BR>
was assigned to a feasibility study group on reentry body
<BR>
interceptors, not because the U.S. wanted to build such a thing,
<BR>
but wanted to make sure the commies couldnt do it.
<BR>
<P>He came up with a feedback control diagram that showed
<BR>
what would be needed.  The rocket hardware technology,
<BR>
the valves, the actuators, the nozzles, all that stuff wasnt
<BR>
too out-of-reach at the time.  The thing that was in the
<BR>
science fiction realm was the computer needed to make
<BR>
it all work.  It required that the computer be carried on-board,
<BR>
which was understandably a radical concept at the time.  This
<BR>
young engineer with the freshly minted PhD mapped out, way
<BR>
back in 1971, the system that would eventually become the
<BR>
THAAD missile.  It is the stuff of legend today.
<BR>
<P>Now of course, what he proposed at the time would have
<BR>
sounded like &quot;...if we had a computer with the power of
<BR>
100 crays in a package the size of a marble...&quot;  The audience
<BR>
politely thanked him and NEXT!  But the miracles of miniaturization
<BR>
kept coming and kept coming.  And coming and coming until
<BR>
by the late 80s it didnt look crazy at all to carry an on-board
<BR>
computer capable enough to run a feedback loop fast enough
<BR>
to hit a bullet with a bullet.  Last Saturday was the first anniversary
<BR>
of the first successful THAAD hit.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, my friend who did this study in 1971 still works
<BR>
at Lockheed.  He is kind of an honorary godlike character,
<BR>
a visionary, an advisor.  But he saw 30 years into the future.
<BR>
<P>I propose we look into the future, with the knowledge that
<BR>
in 30 years, we will likely have 100-cray computers in
<BR>
packages the size of a marble.  Then what can we do?
<BR>
<P>What about Rosie the maid from the Jetsons?  Given sufficiently
<BR>
high power computers and feedback loops, could we not build
<BR>
droids that could do all the things Rosie did, carrying on witty
<BR>
conversation at the same time?  It is all doable, with just
<BR>
superfast computers and sufficiently sophisticated digital
<BR>
feedback control systems!
<BR>
<P>Let us think like Dr. THAAD, not simply dismissing a
<BR>
way-out idea, but rather estimating what would actually
<BR>
be needed to carry out your fondest dreams.  Then let us
<BR>
work to make that happen.  Wooo hoooo!  spike
