<EM>&gt; &gt;It seems to me that you *are* playing in the academic game, even if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;don't realize it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But the point is whose rules .... I am outside the academic journal loop, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be said to playing *against* the academic game rather than in it. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aim for a big inter-theoretic reduction that will shake-up many academics.
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't play against other games; you play against other players in a game.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Academia has succeeded across many centuries as remaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the most authoritative source people turn to when asking abstract questions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Along with the various Churches &amp;c, yes, it has been the &quot;establishment&quot; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the human-era past, but with the post-human age will not necessarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue to have authority. It must earn this authority constantly by being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;correct.&quot;  ... if academics are wrong surely they forfeit authority?
</EM><BR>
<P>Being wrong sometimes won't hurt academia very much, if there is no
<BR>
clearcompetitor that is right more often.  You might personally be right.  But
<BR>
you
<BR>
aren't an institution people can turn to again and again to ask questions.  How
<BR>
often are people *like you* right?  That is, consider the set of people who look
<BR>
<P>to ordinary people similar to you in terms of ability to answer abstract
<BR>
questions; how often are they right?
