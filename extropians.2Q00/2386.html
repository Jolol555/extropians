<P>Yesterday I was a saint.  Today Im outright evil.  Go figure.  {8^D

<EM>&gt; IMO the Open Society movement is in a phase similar to what Communism went

<EM>&gt; through before the Russian revolution.

<P>But the pre-commies had a choice.  I dont feel we really do,
<BR>
except perhaps to control the rate at which we go transparent.

You can be sure a post-singularity AI will figure out a way
<BR>
to watch everyone.  {8-|
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is also similar to Communism in its destructive potential. Any deliberate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempt to create such a society is going to end up building a surveillance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state instead.  ...   It could very easily happen here.
</EM><BR>
<P>Roger that.  Eugene, I agree that transparent society is a threat,
<BR>
but that it has benefits as well.  As society becomes more transparent
<BR>
we must compensate by voting more libertarian governments.
<BR>
<P>Hey thats a positive spin: currently libertarians never actually
<BR>
*win* elections.  If people grok that their society is going
<BR>
transparent, perhaps we may shock ourselves and win a
<BR>
few elections.  Truth is, even the most law-abiding among
<BR>
us occasionally do things we dont want the law man to know
<BR>
about.  spike
