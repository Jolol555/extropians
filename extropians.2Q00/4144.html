<EM>&gt; This whole privacy-in-the-bedroom obsession must be a recent thing.

<EM>&gt; I dont think people had such luxury until a few hundred years ago, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yet they managed to get by somehow.  Perhaps most people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be able to afford some form of antisurveillance, and those who

<EM>&gt; cannot will manage anyway, perhaps by being far less modest about

<P>Yeah, try going to a nudist resort sometime- you get over your body
<BR>
shyness quite quickly.  I do have to admit that the saloon doors on the
<BR>
men's restroom surprised me, with women and children walking by in the
<BR>
hallway- but nobody cared, or bothered to look.  I shrugged, flushed the
<BR>
urinal, and stepped around the corner into the communal shower-
<BR>
convenient not to need to do anything about that infamous &quot;last
<BR>
drop&quot;....
<BR>
<P>(Another guy told me that what *did* faze him was when the female
<BR>
janitor came in and replaced the paper towels while he was taking a
<BR>
whiz- but again, ya just think about about it, shrug, and carry on.)
