<EM>&gt; &gt; Observation in person is one thing, automated pattern recognition by a

<EM>&gt; &gt; computer and issuance of tickets by computer is another ball of wax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; entirely. Unless they man every camera with a human being, this is in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fact unconstitutional, because it violates your right to confront your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; accuser. You can't confront a computer, it is not a person.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Any means of gathering evidence not under immediate human supervision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and control is mere hearsay evidence, no matter how accurate or well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; time stamped it is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry, Mike, but I think you're really reaching here. By that logic nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done on the Internet could ever qualify as a crime, unless someone manages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to literally look over your shoulder while you do it. With immersive VR and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal software agents on the horizon, and most of the financial world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becoming increasingly automated, the idea that only direct observations by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human beings can be used as evidence is completely impractical. There are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just too many ways to commit theft, fraud and vandalism in ways that are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physically impossible to observe in that fashion.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which speaks more to how the internet violates our privacy and the
<BR>
security of our property rather than to a problem with the legal
<BR>
principle. The internet is our tool, not the reverse, we should not have
<BR>
our rights be enslaved to its limitations. We should not accept a police
<BR>
state just so we can feel better about ordering books online with our
<BR>
credit cards.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The obvious solution, which has already been adopted by the courts, is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allow evidence from log files, recording devices and forensic tests while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keeping in mind that such evidence is not necessarily 100% reliable. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cases where a recording device is the only evidence there is a tendency to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go overboard with reliability measures, requiring that manufacturers achieve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incredibly high reliability levels before their evidence can be considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficient for a conviction. In cases where the recording device merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corroborates human testimony, such as convenience store video cameras, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standard of reliability is of course much lower. This all seems pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonable to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the courts insist upon extremely high reliability levels for recorded
<BR>
evidence that is not corroborated by human eyewitness testimony, then
<BR>
they obviously share my concerns.
<BR>
<P>Log files and other recorded data, especially on the internet, is highly
<BR>
abstracted from reality, easily misinterpreted and manipulated. For
<BR>
example, with a few hours work, I could jimmy up a log file that shows
<BR>
that you used my web server to access kiddy porn sites overseas on
<BR>
numerous occasions, enough so that a particularly zealous cop could get
<BR>
a search warrant and literally destroy your house, office, and computer
<BR>
system looking for evidence. 
<BR>
<P>If you or anyone in your office or household is like the average male
<BR>
web browser, you've got a good number of porn images saved to your
<BR>
system or sitting in your browser cache directory. While you may have
<BR>
never actively searched out kiddy porn, it is highly likely that, if any
<BR>
user of your computer is typical of the average male web browser, you
<BR>
have files which could be argued fit the statutory definition of kiddy
<BR>
porn, that you never intentionally saved, or that you understood to be
<BR>
nothing but flat chested 18-20 year old women. Despite actual innocence,
<BR>
you could be strung up in public as a sexual predator. 
<BR>
<P>Even if you don't browse such things, I could also anonymously email you
<BR>
a zip file with such images in it. You could deleted the message, but
<BR>
the attachment would still sit in your cache, and even if you deleted
<BR>
your cache, the data can still be recovered by law enforcement level
<BR>
data recovery techniques.
<BR>
<P>A system that relies on unwitnessed, abstract, impersonal data is at
<BR>
high risk of corruption, perversion, and manipulation. It is not data
<BR>
that should be trusted in a court of law.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As for the right to confront your accuser, well, we are just going to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to face up to the fact that it is now possible for a criminal to be caught
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; red-handed by a completely automated system. This is going to become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasingly common whether the government puts up cameras or not - for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example, if Amex's (existing) activity-checking AI spots you using a stolen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; credit card, you have the same problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IMO the logical application of our current principles would be to consider
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the organization that runs the surveillance device to be your accuser, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consider the presence of their chosen representative in the courtroom to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement.  I also think it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important that the defense be able to subpoena anyone who has anything to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with running the system, so that you can effectively raise issues regarding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its reliability.
</EM><BR>
<P>The organization can only appoint a person to act as an expert witness
<BR>
to analyse the material evidence, which can easily be cross examined as
<BR>
well as rebutted by equally competent expert witnesses for the defense,
<BR>
including other employees or former employees of the surveilling
<BR>
organization.
