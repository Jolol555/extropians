<P>
Michael.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Calling non-human humans who have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  demonstrated by deed as individuals that they do not regard other humans as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  worthy of living for no good reason (like those no good reasons stated 
</EM><BR>
above)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  is not evil, and is merely putting rabid dogs down.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>A human is not a dog, no matter how evil. Nowhere in the world can a person 
<BR>
kill a dog, and be tried for murder. 
<BR>
<P>I did not say that calling people animals is evil. Re-read my post. I said 
<BR>
calling them an animal *so you don't have to feel bad about killing him&quot;  is 
<BR>
falling into the same self deception as the murderer himself. 
<BR>
As you point out yourself:  the phenomenon of Hitler:
<BR>
<P>&quot;&gt;  Hitler loved to paint too. Would you have painted with him in prison had 
<BR>
we
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  gotten our hands on him? I don't think so.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Yes sir, I would have it I was called to do so.  If nothing else out of 
<BR>
curiosity. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You work with children, the 'noble savages'. We are discussing adults, who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  supposedly 'know better'.
</EM><BR>
<P>The children I work with are being tried as adults, and I am relatively 
<BR>
certain that a law and order type such as yourself is in favor of this. They 
<BR>
have killed or robbed in a violent fashion, are risks to society, and are up 
<BR>
for life or death penalties or whatever else anyone over 18 can get. Some are 
<BR>
as young as 15, some are already of age. 
<BR>
<P>For the record I am not in favor of the death penalty for my own reasons, 
<BR>
even for Richard Ramirez, and though I wouldn't cry over him, and you cannot 
<BR>
sway my opinion by any argument, please don't  try.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Just because a creature is polite, engaging, and
</EM><BR>
<P>Try 'con-artists' that's more accurate.
<BR>
BUT - they are humans --  'creature' implies animal, lizard, bird or fish. 
<BR>
For someone like Ted Bundy, 'monster' I might accept, since we mankind is the 
<BR>
origin of that concept. 
<BR>
<P>Mostly what this constituency is, is inconceivably ignorant and Pavlovian. 
<BR>
They behave like dogs, but they are NOT dogs and can be talked to and 
<BR>
reasoned with - THEY HAVE SIMPLY NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO RATIONAL THOUGHT. 
<BR>
Depending on the early childhood damage done, rehabilitation is possible. 
<BR>
<P>The prison system has no interest in this, due to the easiness of treating 
<BR>
them like &quot;animals&quot;. Anything else takes effort. 
<BR>
<P>I accuse you of the same laziness. It's EASY to say they aren't human, that 
<BR>
means you don't have to think about it too hard.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  gregarious when it is not on a vicious rampage does not make it human, you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  say it is human, but not a civil or civilized human. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that is much more honest. If you choose to condone government executions 
<BR>
of badly civilized humans in retribution for evil deeds (or to prevent 
<BR>
further harm to others) so be it!! I may not agree with what you are doing 
<BR>
and you may feel regret -- or not -- but you are thinking clearly, and not 
<BR>
using a comforting self delusion for killing a human being.
<BR>
