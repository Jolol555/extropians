<EM>&gt; &gt; entities which replicate most effectively. You can start with a

<EM>&gt; &gt; 99.999999999% pure population of 'voluntary' non-replicators, and you
</EM><BR>
will
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; still end up with an environment dominated by industrious replicators.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is assuming that the replicators retain their desire to replicate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and that there are no constraints on their replication.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, no, it doesn't assume nearly that much. You just need an
<BR>
environment in which it is possible for natural selection to take place. If
<BR>
you have that, in the long run you will get an environment filled to
<BR>
capacity with replicators no matter what initial conditions you choose.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What if there is a convention adopted by the entities involved that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unconstrained replication is not allowed.  Any unconstrained replication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is viewed as a threat and is prevented.  Some entities would like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replicate, but they cannot.  Most do not want to replicate, and attempt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to prevent others from doing so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a common theme explored in science fiction, where in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overpopulated world there are laws regulating the number of children.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A moderate form of this is supposedly already being practiced in China.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems to me that this would be a stable situation, and one which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be adopted because it produces a better outcome for the participants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than they would get in a world of unconstrained replication.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it is a popular idea. It is also astonishingly naive - not quite on the
<BR>
same level as trying to legislate the value of pi, but close.
<BR>
<P>To make population control work in the very long run (i.e. geological eras)
<BR>
you must have absolutely 100% effective monitoring and enforcement against
<BR>
every single entity in the entire civilization, with no exceptions of any
<BR>
kind no matter what the circumstances. No legal system has ever achieved
<BR>
such a result for any law, and there are good reasons to suspect that it is
<BR>
in principle impossible for such a thing to happen.
<BR>
<P>If the society existed in a sealed environment, where illicitly-produced
<BR>
children had to compete for a fixed pool of resources with their elders,
<BR>
slightly imperfect enforcement  would simply create a weak selection
<BR>
pressure in favor of people who wish to reproduce and are capable of getting
<BR>
away with it. However, the actual situation is far less stable.
<BR>
<P>Any civilization which attempts to follow a path of non-replication will be
<BR>
surrounded by vast expanses of unexploited space, which offer a huge payoff
<BR>
for any replicators that reach it. Even a very slow leakage of replicators
<BR>
from the monitored region to unmonitored space will very quickly result in
<BR>
the &quot;non-replicators&quot; being outnumbered by the &quot;replicators&quot;. At that point
<BR>
the &quot;non-replicators&quot; are no longer capable of enforcing their pact, and
<BR>
simple selection for reproductive success takes over.
<BR>
<P>Besides, how do you get to that point in the first place? The economic and
<BR>
military advantages of rapid growth are very large, so any social group
<BR>
which does not join a proposed &quot;growth ban treaty&quot; would enjoy a substantial
<BR>
competitive advantage over groups which do join such a treaty. On the other
<BR>
hand, in the long run there is no particular advantage to be gained by
<BR>
joining such a treaty, so why would anyone do so?
<BR>
<P>Finally, you can't just postulate an eternally inflexible attitude as a
<BR>
given. The opinions of individual members of a society are themselves the
<BR>
result of a Darwinian process, the selection of memes in the meme pool.
<BR>
Public opinion on any issue will change over time (at least, only any issue
<BR>
that isn't a simple matter of fact), and preventing this from happening is
<BR>
another inherently intractable problem.
