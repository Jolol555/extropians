<EM>&gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt;Tell me, if cheap and easy nuclear fusion magically became possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;today, and within a few months most everybody had a fusion plant in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;their back yard, what do you think would happen to the economy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Power would become cheap and lots of people (power co. employees) would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably become unemployed.  What has that to do with health or happiness?
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats another part of the discussion. My point here is to explain that we all
<BR>
exist in states of current equilibria. If the system we are in suddenly changes
<BR>
conditions, we are all no longer in states of equilibria anymore, and there will
<BR>
be dislocation, chaos, losses of efficiency, and abject suffering as a result.
<BR>
When a system instead steadily shifts its conditions over time, we are all able
<BR>
to keep pace with these changes and maintain our relative levels of happiness,
<BR>
productivity, efficiency, etc.
<BR>
<P>With regard to health, if we all suddenly were relatively immortal, you wouldn't
<BR>
notice anything immediately, and people would continue to behave as they have
<BR>
always done in a 'mortal' world. The behaviors normal for a mortal world do not
<BR>
work in the long run for an immortal world, however. With regard to happiness, I
<BR>
doubt very much that it is possible to reach a state of permanent and perfect
<BR>
happiness. Why? Because we tend to filter out whatever the current level of
<BR>
'background noise' is in our lives. When you reach a level of constant happiness
<BR>
that you regard today to be 'perfect', you will consider it to be rather ho-hum
<BR>
average boringness. If you suddenly reached that level of happiness today, you'd
<BR>
either die from it, or you'd be one of the most unproductive people around (why
<BR>
be productive when you've reached nirvana, right?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about if nanotech became magically possible today? I'll tell you: the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;economy would go into a major depression for a good 3-10 years. You are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;talking about making obsolete a whole economy almost overnight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not even.  The economy would undergo a radical shift, but that is not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same as a depresssion.  OK, so lots of people in the business of making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things lose their jobs.  So what?  As long as you buy your near anything box
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before you get laid off, who needs a job?
</EM><BR>
<P>You are a) assuming that everyone will be able to afford anything boxes, that
<BR>
they won't be hoarded by a few and used to enslave everyone else
<BR>
b) assuming that everyone will buy an anything box
<BR>
c) assuming that they will still have their jobs by the time the Boxes are
<BR>
affordable by the average person. Thats a lot of assumptions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Like an economy and levels of technology, things like health, justice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and happiness are achieved as meta-stable states within systems that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have limits on input and output, they are semi-closed systems. Progress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in improving or in moving to higher states of stability in these areas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;can only occur at rates that can be survived. I am not saying that there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;are absolute limits, but there are limits to what is possible to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;digested *today*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that immortality for all *today* would present something of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population growth problem.  But IMO immortality will follow nano, which will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make population growth a benefit, rather than a detriment.  Once we are able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to use substantially larger portions of the globe for human habitat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (including deserts, the poles and in, over and under the oceans - not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mention space) the population growth problem evaporates.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats been the crux of my argument. Slower, steady growth and change is
<BR>
survivable, and can be adapted to. Sudden changes that are not foreseen cause
<BR>
major disruptions. In the end we benefit more, but there is more suffering than
<BR>
there has to be in the interim before the benefits become commonplace.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If you reach a state of total happiness, what more do you have to live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I already enjoy a state of total joy (not quite the same as happiness, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty close).  I won't be totally happy until everyone else is too.  (I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of those weirdos who can't be ecstatic while others are suffering.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Bog save us from this guy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But overcoming all my obstacles will not make me ready for the dustbin.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There will still be plenty for me to live for, such as enjoying my own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happiness, satisfying my curiosities by lifelong learning, seeking out new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and unique people, places and experiences, reading all the books I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have time for, catching up on all the Seinfeld episodes I missed, writing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the novel I don't have time to finish now, recording the album I've never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had time to start, riding my mountain bike at all the exotic trails I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heard about but never been able to go to, painting, living, loving and just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plain having a ball.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Being for endless growth also implies a constant reapprisal and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;redetermination of what will make us truly happy. Reaching such a state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;before you know you want to be there will merely cause you to fail to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;appreciate it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps.  I'm not convinced though.  I already know I want to be there and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure I'll appreciate it.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Be careful what you wish for...&quot;
