<P>That's a hard call. I've had cars that needed extensive fix-ups due to
<BR>
rust before they'd pass the test. On the other hand, that was structural
<BR>
stuff -- the underbody had become corroded and was likely to go if it
<BR>
wasn't fixed.  In general, you can get away with cosmetic rust -- they
<BR>
just don't like cars that they think will break up in event of an accident
<BR>
(and remember, they have to make a judgement call on how far the rusting
<BR>
will progress in another 12 months, with a damp winter somewhere in it).
<BR>
<P>Where this gets murky is the fact that most garages that carry out MoT
<BR>
testing are also repair shops. So they've got a conflict of interest; if
<BR>
they're tough on the motorist, they may pick up extra business. Some
<BR>
years ago this (and the passing of bribes) became enough of a problem that
<BR>
the Ministry sent out some undercover inspectors to make random checks, and
<BR>
started a hotline for reporting suspected abuse of the system -- at which 
<BR>
point it began working a bit better. Another sensible move it to tell
<BR>
the test centre people in advance that any work on your vehicle required to
<BR>
bring it up to spec will be carried out elsewhere.
