<P><EM>&gt;In deference to Sasha and his family, I ask you not to speculate on what

<EM>&gt;happened. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I understand, but in view of the outpouring of grief on the list, and
<BR>
discussions of cryonics options, etc, I do think an adjacent topic needs to
<BR>
be raised for the long-term benefit of us all.
<BR>
<P>Reading between the lines, I gather that Sasha took his own life. Even if
<BR>
he'd had cryonics arrangements in place, I wonder if that fact might have
<BR>
prevented any cryonics organization from fulfilling his suspension. 
<BR>
<P>Some of us might find it easy to empathize with the bone-deep despair that
<BR>
can afflict a person, making suicide appear the only or at least the most
<BR>
plausible escape hatch. I suspect that quite a few people on this list are
<BR>
prey to such affliction from time to time, because it is exactly those who
<BR>
are clear-sighted, smart and hence (usually) somewhat alienated from the
<BR>
rest of society who simultaneously suffer this anguish while strenuously
<BR>
maintaining the need for dynamic optimism.
<BR>
<P>Probably the only way to guard against fatal attacks of despair is to live
<BR>
within a deeply connected community and/or family. Many of us are
<BR>
profoundly cut off from both. I would hope that we can find our way to
<BR>
develop such a caring community (and forgive me if, as a geographical
<BR>
outsider, I'm misrepresenting extropian and &gt;H life in the States, Sweden
<BR>
and other places). But I also feel there needs to be some
<BR>
technically-mediated way for a person finding himself or herself in such
<BR>
wretchedness to step back for a while, allow the passage of time to do its
<BR>
healing (as it does, I know). Perhaps there are available drugs that do
<BR>
this without making you stupid and numb. I don't know of any, but then I'm
<BR>
fairly ignorant of psychopharmacology. Anyone here have anything to add to
<BR>
my blurry suggestion?
<BR>
