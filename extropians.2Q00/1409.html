In modern Italy (home of the vatican ironically) they have the lowest 
<BR>
birthrate in Europe! I think the young women may have gotten a 
<BR>
little too fed up with the examples they saw growing up.  Any 
<BR>
thoughts Serafino?  I  have heard some say we are going the way 
<BR>
of ancient Rome, but then we are not an empire that prides itself in 
<BR>
just one racial and ethnic stock.

<P>1981 italians were 56.556.911
<BR>
1991 they were 56.778.031
<BR>
1998 they were 56.589.615 (plus 1.023.000 registered 
<BR>
immigrants, mainly from north africa, plus about 1.000.000 not 
<BR>
registered immigrants).
<BR>
We hope that (working) immigrants can sustain (by means of 
<BR>
taxation) our welfare state. Otherwise our welfare state will crash 
<BR>
very soon. 
<BR>
Of course we are not able to get taxes from mafia economy.
<BR>
The negative birth-death balance in Italy is due, mainly, to the very 
<BR>
chaotic living, and mental stress, and sudden wealth. 
<BR>
I.e.: we have about 200.000 different laws! Every year the tax rules 
<BR>
and laws output is a printed strip, 3 kilometers long, in A4 format.
