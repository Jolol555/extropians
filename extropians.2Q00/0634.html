<P>
James,
<BR>
<P>I personally don't have the &quot;clout&quot; to reverse the mental &quot;paradigms&quot;
<BR>
that people have, esp. those of CNN announcers.  My personal opinion is
<BR>
that there are going to be a *lot* of people who wake up in 15 or 20 years
<BR>
and suddenly realize &quot;Oh my god, people don't 'age' anymore&quot;.  It
<BR>
isn't worth the mental or physical energy to try and change their
<BR>
minds, when that energy can be used instead to actually go solve
<BR>
the problems.
<BR>
<P>Things are moving forward very nicely with things like the
<BR>
genome project, gene chip studies of aging genes and things like the
<BR>
p21 research.
<BR>
<P>If you haven't caught it yet, Virginia Postrel's and Ronald Bailey's
<BR>
articles on the recent Templeton conference are quite interesting
<BR>
reading.
<BR>
<P>See: <A HREF="http://www.reason.com/opeds/forbes/041700.html">http://www.reason.com/opeds/forbes/041700.html</A>
<BR>
<P>It is worth nothing that there were a host of people at that
<BR>
conference from the biotech industry making it quite clear that changes
<BR>
are coming fast and furious.  I found the comments of the bioethicists
<BR>
so silly, that I'm probably going to have to write a position
<BR>
piece in response.  The Templeton Foundation has much more
<BR>
&quot;clout&quot; in making people aware of the progress occuring than I do.
<BR>
If newscasters or press people choose to focus on the controversy
<BR>
of the conferences more than the science, then that is an
<BR>
interesting comment on how upset people are going to be when
<BR>
the &quot;We must all die (soon)&quot; paradigm actually shifts.
<BR>
<P>Just so you don't think things are standing still.  Allen Tough is
<BR>
working on another Templeton conference for next spring where
<BR>
people like myself and Paul Davies and others get to seriously look at
<BR>
what happens when civilizations do evolve to a non-aging state,
<BR>
develop nanotech, etc.  The framework of that conference will
<BR>
be very much in the vein of &quot;of course&quot; you get superintelligent,
<BR>
immortal &quot;beings&quot;.  So there are people who are thinking this
<BR>
way in spite of the efforts of newscasters to take only baby steps.
<BR>
<P>There is also a private meeting, being hosted by Dave Kekich and
<BR>
LifeEx Tech in June, where we are going to spend 2 days with people
<BR>
from industry, govmt, investors and academics, really trying to
<BR>
put together a &quot;Roadmap for Lifespan Extension&quot;.  My thinking is
<BR>
that the &quot;Roadmap&quot; for the semiconductor industry was what has
<BR>
really made Moore's Law work the last 10 years or so.  We need
<BR>
an equivalent working document for the Lifespan Extension
<BR>
industry if we are to make similar progress.  Once you have
<BR>
a concrete plan, then you throw it on the desks of the CNN
<BR>
newscasters and watch them spin their wheels.
<BR>
<P>As was the case with nanotech, it took &quot;throw weight&quot; books like
<BR>
Nanomedicine and Nanosystems to make it &quot;real&quot;.  It will require
<BR>
a similar effort with Lifespan extension.
<BR>
<P>The best thing people can do in their day-to-day lives is to
<BR>
poke at the paradigm of their friends, family, coworkers, taxi
<BR>
drivers, etc.  Little by little the fabric will thin, tear
<BR>
and then totally fall apart.  Watching those &quot;ah-ha's&quot; as
<BR>
the light-bulbs go on is one of those pleasures we who
<BR>
see this already get to enjoy.  Then we get more people
<BR>
to join us in figuring out how *not* to let the nightmares
<BR>
of people such as Bill Joy or nanoterrorists spoil the party.
<BR>

<EM>&gt; We would all grow old and die but the study of this gene might help us live

<EM>&gt; I was wondering if you had the clout to introduce them to the myriad efforts

<EM>&gt; made towards defeating aging such as telemere research and the rest I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you have knowledge of. They need to know they've missed a scoop. Is this

<EM>&gt; mainstream ignorance of immortalism simply oversight or by design?
