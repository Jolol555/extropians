<EM>&gt; I think _American Scientist_ is much better in regards to nanotechnology and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life extension -- more interested in examining the ideas rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dismissing them.  The current issue has the nanotechnology article
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Biomolecules and Nanotechnology.&quot;   A previous issue had an examination of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slowing down aging and some of the problems involved in life extension from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an engineering perspective.  The former is now online at:

<P>This was an interesting and easy-to-read article which provided an
<BR>
insightful view on some of the organizing principles used by life in
<BR>
constructing its version of nanotech.
<BR>
<P>Cells are constrained by the materials they have to work with, and by
<BR>
the fact that the error rate in constructing proteins prevents them
<BR>
from building ones beyond a certain size.  So what they do is build
<BR>
them with self-assembling sub-units.  If a sub-unit is malformed due to
<BR>
an error, it won't fit with the others and so it won't be picked up in
<BR>
the self-assembly.  At least that seems to be the theory.
<BR>
<P>The interesting thing is that many large protein complexes are built out
<BR>
of repeated copies of a single protein, which self-assembles with itself
<BR>
to produce a linear or ring structure.  Sometimes a few more proteins
<BR>
are used as components, but when this happens the repeated units are
<BR>
arranged symmetrically.  Perhaps this is advantageous because you get
<BR>
the effect of a large structure by coding for just a single protein.
<BR>
<P>I wonder what happens to proteins which get built with errors?  They won't
<BR>
self-assemble and will just float around, useless.  There must be some
<BR>
other machinery which takes them apart, but it would seem hard to take
<BR>
apart an arbitrarily error-loaded protein.  Maybe everything in the cell
<BR>
gets periodically swept into a lysosome and dissolved?
<BR>
<P>Cells also have to work with the fact that their machinery is somewhat
<BR>
soft and floppy.  They exploit this rather than work around it,
<BR>
making machines that wouldn't work if rigid.  The article describes
<BR>
this by saying that cellular machines &quot;breathe&quot;, that is, they flex,
<BR>
expand, contract, open and close slightly all the time.  Many machines
<BR>
wouldn't work at all without breathing; in some cases the active sites
<BR>
are buried inside the complex and are inaccessible until a crack or
<BR>
crevice breathes open.
<BR>
<P>All this provided a fascinating picture of how different the engineering
<BR>
principles used by cells are from how humans design things.  However these
<BR>
ideas didn't sound like they would be applicable to current plans for
<BR>
nanotech.  Hard nanotech won't have the same constraints, limitations,
<BR>
and, yes, flexibility of biotech components.
<BR>
<P>It is unlikely that nanotech designs would breathe in the biological
<BR>
sense; if this function were needed there could be something like a
<BR>
mechanical bellows hooked to clockwork latches which would open and close.
<BR>
<P>Also, the limitations on error-free assembly of large complexes won't
<BR>
apply to nanotech, so there will be no need to rely on building smaller
<BR>
components that self-assemble, and therefore probably no particular
<BR>
reason to use symmetry to the same extent as is done in biology.
