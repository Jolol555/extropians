<EM>&gt; So what you are saying is that you don't currently have a protocol for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neurosuspension customers to simulataneously have their heads guillotined and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspended, while the rest of the organs get harvested? I think thats kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; short sighted, don't you think?  What better way to pay for your suspension than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off of auctioned off body parts? If you made this legal, suspension would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basically be free, so the perceived cost barrier (for those who don't think of,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or don't want to have to keep paying on, a life insurance policy just for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspension) is totally eliminated. Set this up as an accepted medical procedure,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it can simply be a non-cash transaction between an organ donor center and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the donor. Donor centers might find it both profitable, and a good way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diversify, to merge with a cryonic suspension organization.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the future when the medical and legal hurdles to this can be overcome,
<BR>
that might be a great idea for neuro-suspensions.  But today, suspensions
<BR>
have to be done with the technology we have and under the legal system we
<BR>
have or they don't get done.  The technology makes donation problematic:
<BR>
even neuros, for example, make use of the full-body circulatory system to
<BR>
perfuse cryoprotectants, the whole body is frozen, and then &quot;cephalic
<BR>
isolation&quot; is performed (with a chainsaw) on the frozen body.  The legal
<BR>
problems are worse.
<BR>
<P>There is also, of course, the uncertainty that neurosuspension will
<BR>
even work.  To be properly skeptical, I cannot rule out the possibility
<BR>
that some interesting part of what I want to preserve as &quot;me&quot; exists
<BR>
below my neck.  Even if I intend to go the upload route, I can't rule
<BR>
out that there might be interesting software there either.
