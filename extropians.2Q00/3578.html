<EM> &gt; &gt; cleaners will mostl likely come first, will be just a box on wheels,

<EM> &gt; &gt; and they will be considerably cheaper than a car.

<EM> &gt; Given that Honda's P2 and P3 can walk and climb stairs, why not program
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; them to use a vacuum cleaner?
</EM><BR>
<P>1) the price tag 2) if they can walk stairs (I'd like to see it. Can I
<BR>
push them while they'll be doing it? Throwing/removing stuff in their
<BR>
path?  Operate them while children/pets are present?), it doesn't mean
<BR>
they can vacuum a room. No sir. Anyone who wants my office cleaned
<BR>
without turning it into a mess (it's all hidden order, I'm telling
<BR>
you), he's facing a quite superhuman task.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; I agree. Now what could be done with 100 billion $ or 100 trillion
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; $? These are the questions I am putting forward to the Vancouver
</EM><BR>
<P>Some of it can't be hurried, but some of it can. 100 gigabucks, now
<BR>
that would be serious money. (100 terabucks is meaningless, because
<BR>
the market is not enough to absorb it without being changed radically)
<BR>
However, I'd rather have it spent in nanotechnology and gerontology,
<BR>
and space industry, if it was mine to command.

<P><EM> &gt; television group which says it wants to do an ed tv documentary on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;machine psychology&quot;. I want the top experts in the world to answer and I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; think they will.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The phrase &quot;machine psychology&quot; is rather purple, considered that we
<BR>
even can't get the low-level motorics done properly. So far, this
<BR>
falls under the cathegory &quot;algorithmic artefacts&quot;, at best.

<P><EM> &gt; &gt; Japan has pioneered some remarkably audacious and unremarkably failing 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; projects in the past.

<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Hey...I remember the Alamo...or was it Pearl Harbour? Anyway, to use your
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; expression, below, So what?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
If you point towards an ambitious AI project in Nippon, I can point
<BR>
towards a series of very impressive failures. Meaning, the fact alone
<BR>
that Japan is doing a particular AI project is not sufficient to get
<BR>
me all wet and flushed. This doesn't mean that robotics is a dead
<BR>
horse, but this doesn't mean that particular project is going to go
<BR>
critical, either.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; Yes, so what.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Oh I can think of all kinds of so whats. Like &quot;robot robots&quot; which is what
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know what &quot;robot robots&quot; are. Please explain before you use an 
<BR>
unfamiliar term.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Pearson from BT expects to see happening in about a decade. Like the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; transformation of society when it really is &quot;The End of Work&quot; (Rifkin's
</EM><BR>
<P>The end of work? I thought we worked more and later hours, at reduced
<BR>
wage. Humans are still a great deal more flexible, and cheaper than
<BR>
robots. Only in very few areas are robots going to outperform the
<BR>
price/performance on an illegal immigrant.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; title). And you know what? For those willing to use a little savvy (and I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; don't mean just high tech people) I think the era of &quot;The End of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Work&quot; (total automation) has arrived. The choices are whether to go
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;anthropomorphic&quot; or &quot;nonanthropmorphic&quot; in planning totally automated new
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, let's have this discussion by the time a breakeven point between 
<BR>
human and robotic vehicles on the road has arrived. Meanwhile, there
<BR>
are much juicier topics to sink our fangs into. Let's deal with them,
<BR>
as they arise.
