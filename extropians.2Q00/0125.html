<P>My comments, admittedly, seem in retrospect to have a measure
<BR>
of 'glibness' about them when applied to human travesties and
<BR>
tragedies.  It was late, and I was impatient with the thread --
<BR>
for which I apologize.

<P>This statement is also powerfully rhetorical in the best sense;
<BR>
rather a unique interpolation, or perhaps analogy.

<P>In my own defense, I might add that the thread really was
<BR>
about belief-systems and personal opinion concerning the
<BR>
existence of an abstraction. Perhaps, you too are guilty of
<BR>
a touch of extravagance when you facilely change the agenda
<BR>
from psychology to sociology to moral philosophy to juris-
<BR>
prudence to historical criticism?  I doubt that any brief post
<BR>
could deal with this complexity in a summary way.

<P>Haven't thought of Stirner for a long time; a very

interesting fellow.
