</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spike
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;no such animal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From the descriptions of the Brits on the list, sounds like the UK might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; qualify.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Depends. Property crime rates 5 times higher than the US? No right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; privacy on email? Political dissidents (irish) getting assassinated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government SAS units? No free press (Official Secrets Act and various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; libel laws)? What are the tax rates now over there? What are the value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; added tax rates? Any country that taxes you on the number of closets you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have and the number of televisions you have is NOT a free country.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm inclined to agree with Mike Lorrey that the UK doesn't qualify on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;no repression&quot; metric, but for entirely different reasons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Property crime rates are higher, but the murder rate is much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lower. There's no right to privacy on email ... but that fight's still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being fought in the USA, which has no explicit privacy provision in its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constitution. The SAS aren't shooting IRA members any more, and I hesitate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to call _anyone_ to carries an M-16 a &quot;dissident&quot;. The Official Secrets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Act is in the process of being replaced by a Freedom of Information Act,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the Libel laws aren't censorship by government -- if you want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; censor someone by accusing them of libel, it's a private lawsuit and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it will cost you $$$. As for the tax rates -- income tax is _lower_
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than in the USA, although VAT is higher -- they include no-exclusions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; healthcare and a level of social security not found in the USA.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Basically, Michael is wrong on _every_ count he cites. But he's right in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his overall assertion that the UK (or at least England/Wales, a distinct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legal entity from Scotland or Northern Ireland) is not free.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm so right I'm wrong, I guess?
<BR>
property crime high.... check
<BR>
did SAS kill dissidents? ... check  (that they aren't killing them ANYMORE is
<BR>
irrelevant, only because everyone is now playing nice nice. When the next
<BR>
dissident group shows up will prove if its a true change)
<BR>
Is there an Official Secrets Act? ... check  (and how is the FOI Act any
<BR>
different? New name the same dog?)
<BR>
Do the libel laws enable anyone to keep the media from reporting the truth or
<BR>
punish them for doing so?... check
<BR>
You say the income tax is lower? What are the brackets, the percentages? What are
<BR>
the deductions? What is the cost of living?
<BR>
Value added tax? ... check
<BR>
<P>additionals: are you saying you don't have the right to refuse to participate in
<BR>
the health care system and the social security system?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The whys and wherefores of this are sufficient to fill a book, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basically boil down to &quot;first-past-the-post electoral systems with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no constitutional safeguards suck&quot;. (Or rather, they only provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; representative government when there's a relatively homogeneous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population. And the UK has been becoming increasingly, radically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diverse since the end of the 1950's.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Its still lily white compared to the US.
