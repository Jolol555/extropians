<P>&lt;&lt; Because so many Extropians are educated less in the humanities
<BR>
&nbsp;than the sciences, it may be difficult to discuss this question
<BR>
&nbsp;fruitfully here. We'd have to discuss at least a bit of Luther,
<BR>
&nbsp;if not the early Church Fathers. And for many here that might
<BR>
&nbsp;involve a lot of tedious reading of dusty texts.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;And who the Hell wants to do that?! Once we stop aging, we can
<BR>
&nbsp;get to philosophy, history and such. :)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;(Of course, there won't be Judaism anymore at that point,
<BR>
&nbsp;because the big hyper ai-unity will have sucked up everything
<BR>
&nbsp;into itself, and thus there'll never be a minion.)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Best,
<BR>
&nbsp;Brian. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Moving this off to a different thread (somewhat) I toy with the concept that 
<BR>
Jews may have evolved as one of the catalyst peoples (call it chosen) to 
<BR>
activate, modify and motivate other peoples. Call this an evolutionary 
<BR>
adaptation or a rung on the ladder to the Noosphere (say hey!  Teilhard!) or 
<BR>
something like that there. In might account for &quot;The Longest Hatred&quot; because 
<BR>
no matter what the Jew does, he is hated for it. It historically has become 
<BR>
a-causal despite the desperate, exacerbated, attempts by many to deny this 
<BR>
(personal experience). I call this the Princess and the Pea Effect. 
<BR>
<P>Another Toy idea is that Jews represent (to haters) the possible existence of 
<BR>
a God, and one that the hater is really pissed off at, rather then their own 
<BR>
model. I rather like that one myself. Oh well.
