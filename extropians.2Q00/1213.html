<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well from James' more recent post it seems that I had *him* wrong when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; suggested that he was espousing summary execution for cops who did bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; shootings.  He seems to understand the overarching impracticality of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;such an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; extreme measure.  You, however, seem to think it would be a good thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I pose the question now to you - where in the world do you think you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; find people to take the job of a cop if a mistake in judgment would lead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; their summary execution?  How much do you think such brave souls would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be paid to take the job?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There are many millions of law abiding citizens who carry concealed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;weapons every day (myself included), who live under the same standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;every day. If I kill someone I beleive is committing a crime with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;deadly weapon, why should I be held to a higher standard of behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;than a cop who does the same thing? Since the cop is supposedly more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;trained than I, he should be the one living up to the higher standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;than I (why should he have more authority if he isn't more trained?). If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I make a mistake, and kill someone, I can be held responsible, just as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you describe. I accept that risk, because I know that there is a greater
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;risk if I DONT carry that gun that someone WILL get hurt by my inability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to either defend myself or someone else. And, I don't get paid a dime to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;take that risk.. Howz them apples?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah I suppose there are some people who get their thrills by packing heat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the anticipated rush of actually getting to use it on somebody.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still being a citizen packing heat while going about your office cubicle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; routine of a life is a far cry from having a job description which requires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you to go into the most dangerous areas of your city everyday looking for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the most dangerous people in those dangerous areas and convincing them to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accompany you downtown to begin the process of possibly being incarcerated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a substantial fraction of their lives.
</EM><BR>
<P>a) there is no 'thrill' or 'rush' from packing heat. Anyone who does so for that
<BR>
purpose or to get the chance to use it on somebody shouldn't be carrying, or
<BR>
should really reexamine why they are carrying. This is the typical response of
<BR>
the hoplophobes, that people who carry are a bunch of bloodthirsty sadists that
<BR>
wanna go out and kick ass. This couldn't be further from the truth. To have a
<BR>
carry permit, you have to be one of the more squeaky clean and non-violent
<BR>
people in your society. When I applied for my permit, the cops called around to
<BR>
at least half a dozen people who knew me (not people I had given as references,
<BR>
as, according to the police chief, &quot;Those people are gonna say nice things about
<BR>
you.&quot;) and asked questions like 'is he a violent person?', 'has he ever been
<BR>
mean to animals?', etc...which led to some interesting phone calls to me later
<BR>
in the week....they also did a 50 state and a federal background check for any
<BR>
criminal record (even though state law says its not required).
<BR>
<P>b) in a society where everyone took such responsibility for themselves, you
<BR>
wouldn't need to go at it alone. There would be a good couple dozen other
<BR>
responsible citizens right there along with you. In such a society, there would
<BR>
be no such thing as a 'dangerous area'.
