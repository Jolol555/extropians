<P>
<EM>&gt; [Robert Wasley] was transfixed. How often were you going to see an assembly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; digerati of this magnitude in one room for free? The atmosphere was electric
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; audience totally engaged.
</EM><BR>
<P>Damn seldom.  Once or twice a decade?
<BR>
<P>Fred Moulton and I agreed that had they offered tickets at 50 bucks
<BR>
each they still woulda crammed that hall to overflow, and most of us
<BR>
woulda paid 100.
<BR>
<P>What impressed me is how extropian notions have gone mainstream in
<BR>
just 10 years.  Consider the first west coast nanocon, hosted by the
<BR>
K. Eric.  There were I think a couple hundred of us there in Palo
<BR>
Alto in [I think] 1990, the way out on the edge types, the dreamers.
<BR>
But at yesterday's Nerdstock I saw perhaps a couple thousand all
<BR>
together if you include all the people who wanted to get in and couldnt.
<BR>
<P>What do you suppose it will look like in another 10 yrs?  I predict
<BR>
we will all choose subspecialties in the loose collection of ideas we
<BR>
now discuss in extropians.  spike
