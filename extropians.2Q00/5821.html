<EM>&gt; &gt; BTW, in my cab driving days I once had a belligerent passenger (standing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; behind the open left rear door) grab my left wrist as I reached back for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the cash awkwardly offered from behind.  He started to lift a weapon in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; his right hand (I never did see exactly what it was), so I threw the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gearshift in reverse and ran him over with the door.  If I'd thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; just a bit faster I'd have cocked the wheel to my right to swing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; front of the car over him, too.  Asshole.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Driving over him once you could dismiss as an accident. If you changed gears and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; went over him a second time, you might have some problems...
</EM><BR>
<P>Hell, I backed up all the way to the end of the block, did a skidding
<BR>
90° turn, the door slammed when I hit the brakes, and I burned rubber
<BR>
out of there.  He may have had a gun, I'd lost track of his buddy, and I
<BR>
had his bait $10 bill for a $7 fare, so I figured I won... don't mess
<BR>
with a cabbie, he has a lethal weapon at his fingertips.
<BR>
<P>Those were exciting days.  Now I just run rocket engines from two feet
<BR>
away :)
