<EM>&gt; &gt;The majority doesn't become any less oppressive because they're voting

<P>Sure its different. Just because some people spend their money one way
<BR>
doesn't mean you have to too or risk losing all of your money.

<EM>&gt; The (shop-)counter argument is presumably that a market offers the option
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of many different choices on display, with no obligation to purchase any.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If your (or my) political arrangements are less exhaustive, whose fault is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (As an ignorant and provincial Aussie, I'm simply flabbergasted by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rumour I hear that in order to vote in the USA, citizens are required first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to *register* with *one of the parties*, although apparently they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allowed to change their vote once inside the booth [and even write in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; candidate's name, a cool choice not offered here]... Can this be true? The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind genuinely boggles.)
</EM><BR>
<P>No, its not true. You can register as an independent voter. The
<BR>
political parties in some states may not let you vote in THEIR primary,
<BR>
(or they may let you vote, but it won't count), but the primary is not
<BR>
the election. Any legal age voter that is not a felon or convict can
<BR>
vote in an election.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Equally boggling to an outsider might be *our* laws penalising those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *don't* turn up at the polling booth. You're not obliged to vote, just to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take your pieces of paper, have your name signed off, and put them--checked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  or otherwise--into the boxes. I rather like this practice, actually. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you're going to have the pretence of free and universal representative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government, you might as well powerfully encourage everyone to confront the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choices on offer. Those who oppose compulsion can pay the fine, after all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a sort of market solution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>So you force people to appear and go through the motions of voting, even
<BR>
if they don't want to or cannot afford the time off to do so. Hmmmm,
<BR>
nice 'free' 'participatory' democracy you've got there.
