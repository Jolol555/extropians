<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, evolution can't make major breaks with past art.

<EM>&gt;  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Hmmmm . . . I'm wondering how I got here, as I contemplate the bacteria 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; my fingernails . . . .
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  And your body still uses the same DNA code and many of the same proteins
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  as that bacteria.  Polyethylene strands could encode the data more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  compactly and robustly, but the legacy system can't be left behind. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Evolution ain't gonna make stainless steel rats.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I drifted off to sleep last night right after posting the thing about me 
<BR>
and the bacteria, I wondered whether you'd have a reply like this in my 
<BR>
in-box when I was having my coffee this morning.  Of course, you're right, 
<BR>
and true breakthroughs require using a methodology of invention completely 
<BR>
different from natural selection.  
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, sometimes incremental optimization IS a really good 
<BR>
developmental pathway.  Having recently been critical here of General Motors' 
<BR>
lack of inventiveness, they HAVE been quite good at some examples of 
<BR>
incremental development.  An example sits under the hood of my beloved 
<BR>
Corvette.  The (now-ironically-misnamed) &quot;small block&quot; V8 that powers it is 
<BR>
the lineal, evolutionary descendent of the original small block first 
<BR>
introduced in 1955.  But the current version has an almost four-fold increase 
<BR>
in absolute power output, weighs quite a bit less and gets three times the 
<BR>
gas mileage, making it arguably ten times as efficient as its original 
<BR>
ancestor.  
<BR>
<P>To continue with this specific example, one could say that the 
<BR>
pushrod-activated valve operation of the Chevy V8 is a &quot;local maximum&quot;, and 
<BR>
that it could never &quot;evolve&quot; into an overhead-cam engine.  This is probably 
<BR>
right.  But sometimes engineers are almost as subject to fashions of thought 
<BR>
as folks in &quot;softer&quot; disciplines.  For years, people &quot;in the know&quot; have 
<BR>
assumed that overhead cam engines are inherently superior.  However, when 
<BR>
Mercedes decided to get back into the racing engine business, they surprised 
<BR>
the world by making their Indy-winning machines &quot;old-fashioned&quot; pushrod V8s!
<BR>
<P>I do think that the most productive suite of design tools of the engineer of 
<BR>
the mid-21st century will include some powerful GA assistance.  These tools 
<BR>
will allow the engineer to concentrate her mental energies on the most 
<BR>
creative aspects of the profession.
