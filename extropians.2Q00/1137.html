<P>
<EM>&gt; I have a feeling that one day in the future, we will consider capitol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; punishment just as barbaric as foreign countries see us now, (Europe seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to look down on our electric chair) or as we now view the guillotine. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acknowledge that I have extreme viewpoints towards hypocritical punishment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's our government &quot;we do not allow killing, it is wrong, so we will kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you&quot;. To me, (and I know not a lot will agree, here's where I throw in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disclaimer: people can use physical punishment towards their own children,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's their family, their business, and their choice, although I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chose not to&quot;) it is just as ironic as if I had a child (say Timmy), that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was hitting the neighbor kid , 'little Cindy' from down the street, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said &quot;Timmy it's wrong to hit other's&quot; and proceeded to hit him 'as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; punishment'. I know that not everyone will agree with this, but I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exact punishments, tend to escalate the action. If we kill murder's, does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this prevent any further murders?
</EM><BR>
One problem is that a lot of people are unwilling to be honest (even
<BR>
with themselves) about what they believe.  They want to cling to the
<BR>
silly idea that &quot;violence is wrong&quot;, when they clearly believe that
<BR>
precisely-applied contextually-appropriate violence is right and good.
<BR>
When a burglar invades my home, I don't call the cops to come give
<BR>
him a timeout--I call them to physically seize him and hold him for
<BR>
trial, which is a means of calmly and rationally determining exactly
<BR>
what form of further violence would be best to apply to protect people
<BR>
from him.
<BR>
<P>I also understand that the cops, as an agency of the government, have
<BR>
the right to do this because I and the other citizens have delegated
<BR>
to them our own inherent right to use this violence in our defense,
<BR>
and I am personally morally responsible for the violence done on my
<BR>
behalf by these agents.
<BR>
<P>I do not support the death penalty, not because I think killing is
<BR>
wrong--killing a human who threatens your life is a just exercise of
<BR>
the human right to self defense, which is itself a consequence of the
<BR>
basic right to life--but because I do not trust the agents to whom
<BR>
this task is delegated to do it properly.  I am not willing to take
<BR>
responsibility for killings on my behalf done by an organization
<BR>
that has proven itself incompetent to do so justly and fairly.
<BR>
