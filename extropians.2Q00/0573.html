<P>
Salon magazine recently interviewed Bill Joy, he of recent &quot;Why the future 
<BR>
doesn't need us&quot; fame.  Perhaps the format does not do justice to Joy's 
<BR>
thinking; interviews often inhibit long and careful explanations.  Still, to 
<BR>
judge from the quote below, I'd say that Joy sadly misapprehends the way that 
<BR>
spontaneous orders work.  Invited to critique Hans Moravecs' pro-evolution 
<BR>
views, Joy said,
<BR>
<P>&quot;We didn't set up our present system without thinking. The Constitution, the 
<BR>
whole economic system we have was designed. So I'm hopeful if only because I 
<BR>
believe we can choose what's in our interest independent of whether it 
<BR>
maximizes someone's notion of profit or destiny. We can choose to have a 
<BR>
social safety net, when in fact business would be more efficient if it didn't 
<BR>
have to pay those costs, and people had to starve in the streets. We can 
<BR>
decide that's not acceptable and we have in most Western societies. That's 
<BR>
not a totally Darwinian choice. The total Darwinian choice would just be to 
<BR>
let it go. But we've decided that's not the kind of society we want to live 
<BR>
in.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From &lt;<A HREF="http://www.salon.com/tech/view/2000/04/10/joy/index2.html">http://www.salon.com/tech/view/2000/04/10/joy/index2.html</A>&gt;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Set aside Joy's disappointingly juvenile views on political economy (lifted 
<BR>
straight out of Dickinson) and his muddled thinking about how some collective 
<BR>
&quot;we&quot; chooses the shape of the world (ignoring Arrow's Theorem).  Does he 
<BR>
really think that &quot;the whole economic system we have was designed&quot;?  It would 
<BR>
be another--and accurate--thing to say that &quot;the economic system arose from 
<BR>
human action.&quot;  But to call it &quot;designed&quot; suggests that Joy fails to 
<BR>
appreciate how spontaneous orders result from human action but not human 
<BR>
*design.*  His oversight leaves me wondering if he really understands 
<BR>
evolution at all.
<BR>
<P>Can well-meaning gadflies do no better than Joy?  What a shame; we would all 
<BR>
benefit from better informed--or at least better articulated--criticisms of 
<BR>
unbounded technological progress.
<BR>
<P>T.0. Morrow
