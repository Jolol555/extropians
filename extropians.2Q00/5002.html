John Clark supposedly said:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If defense cost far more than offence, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it does and always will, then a ABM system can't save it and it doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matter if the city's value is zero or infinity. Don't misunderstand me, I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not happy with this situation but that's the way things are.
</EM><BR>
<P>This saying about defense and offense can be turned on its head though.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From the point of view of trying to destroy an incoming missile, it is
</EM><BR>
the missile which is on the defensive.  If an expensive nuclear missile
<BR>
can be destroyed by inexpensive attacking drones, then the fact that
<BR>
defense costs more than offense means that the ABM can work.
<BR>
<P>This judo twist was also used by Robert Freitas in his article on gray
<BR>
goo.  It had been proposed that gray good would have the edge because
<BR>
destruction is easier than preservation.  But no, Robert Freitas pointed
<BR>
out that it is the gray goo which must replicate and build more of itself.
<BR>
It is vulnerable to attack and now it is the attackers of the gray goo
<BR>
which have the advantage, because it is easier to destroy the goo than
<BR>
it is for the goo to preserve and replicate itself.
<BR>
<P>All in all I'm not sure this defense/offense maxim sheds much light on
<BR>
the situation, when both sides seemingly can use it with equal ease.
