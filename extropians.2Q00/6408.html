MARTIN LING SAID: &quot;...My question: could we 'get away' with using these
<BR>
methods to send FTL signals for near-instantaneous communication over
<BR>
distances?...&quot;
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: Martin, you must be careful in FTL thinking to keep your
<BR>
paradigms clear of each other. Running an inference in one paradigm and then
<BR>
switching to another mightn't be useful.
<BR>
<P>In &quot;classical&quot; QM you have nonlocality with Bell's Theorem AND you have the
<BR>
Born Rule. Bell/nonlocality and Born are axiomatically independent. When you
<BR>
go relativistic, you find Eberhard's theorem lousing up your attempts to do
<BR>
cool stuff with FTL that derives from Bell/nonlocality.
<BR>
<P>The real problem is not to explain single- and -Oligo electron systems...
<BR>
it's macroscale composite systems where you have an problem getting &quot;useful&quot;
<BR>
info across at FTL. In a way it reminds me of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics.
<BR>
<P>Valentini gives us some insight into a whole non-Born continuum of rules...
<BR>
with Born as a degenerate and limiting case... This gets me excited.
<BR>
Whenever a natural law exists as a limiting case, I ask: what's the general
<BR>
case?
<BR>
<P>A more general case can be arrived at in many quantum formulations... in
<BR>
Forrest's formulation... hmmm, I think  you might try intefering with the
<BR>
paths that represent backward time travel... you can do something similar in
<BR>
Cramer's Transactional case.
<BR>
<P>Methinks you'll get a Non-Born situation.
<BR>
<P>You could also do a Jack Sarfatti type EXPLICIT invocation of a Quantum
<BR>
Field, Q,  in system space (... or, I think, as Sarfatti puts it, &quot; beyond
<BR>
spactime&quot;...) that is more or less coupled to the Quantum Wavefunction,
<BR>
(QWF) PSI... this yields a Non-Born scenario.
<BR>
<P>OR you can assume that the Copenhagen axioms refer implicitlty to a Quantum
<BR>
Principle of Equivalence and go ahead and quantize the EMERGENT dynamics of
<BR>
very complex systems - for example a neurodynamical system for a quantum
<BR>
neural net - to find that in certain classes of extremely complex systems, a
<BR>
strongly coupled QWF/Potential Function Q arise implicitly in system space.
<BR>
<P>You may not even have to generalize the axioms... I think Joos et al did
<BR>
something on that but I haven't read it as yet.
<BR>
<P>In such a case the universe gets really interesting.
<BR>
<P>The energy of the quantum vacuum gets useable...and if &quot;will&quot; is a product
<BR>
of a a quantum Neural Net (your brain/mind)... it may be possible to will
<BR>
matter-energy into existence and to create entities that are composed of
<BR>
pure spacetime or even exist beyond spacetime.
<BR>
<P>In fact, if you're very religious, you might want to speculate that the (in
<BR>
this scenario) eminently configurable Q, the field that exists in the system
<BR>
space of such very complex systems as quantum superminds, is, in fact, what
<BR>
those old heathen Greeks called &quot;logos&quot; and what St. John cribbed...
<BR>
identifying Christ with the &quot;Word&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Lastly, who knows...in such a scenario...present alters past... not just
<BR>
future.
<BR>
<P>It's likely (ha!) that Elizer's progeny sometime in the future  - 2012? :) -
<BR>
using sheer will, reaches back into that other singularity... the primordial
<BR>
quantum fireball...perturbing its fluctuations slighly... so that this
<BR>
particular universe appears.
<BR>
<P>God begets himself.

<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; What I mean is the difference between someone watching a moon landing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; in 1969 on TV vs. someone watching it on Alpha Centauri many years
</EM><BR>
later.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; In either case there is a delay, and even if you had instant (FTL) TV
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; signals from the moon to your TV in 1969 there still is no way that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; see that you actually are going &quot;back in time&quot; or causing any kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt; paradox.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; If you're on Earth, or on Alpha Centauri, you don't see a problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; But if you're in a spaceship heading from Alpha Centauri to Earth (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; think that's the right direction) at a relativistic speed, you'll see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the effect precede the cause.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;[snip]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Well, if they see the effect soon enough before the cause, they can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; send some information back to the cause, and prevent the cause from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; happening.  But then how did they ever see the effect?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now - couldn't it perhaps work out that if this happened, their signal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would never be able to reach the point of the cause in time to stop it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In fact, doesn't it definitely work out this way, given that we already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have multiple experiments demonstrating signals arriving before they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;depart which arrange themselves such that this effect cannot be used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;practically signal back in time *to the same point in space*?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;[snip]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I agree.  And that is why FTL communication must not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; possible.  Otherwise, you _could_ send a signal back that could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; prevent an event that has already happened.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have an idea.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What if a signal were sent, by the methods used in recent experiments,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;faster than light - but only a little so. Let's say the distance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;involved is one metre.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Normal light will take 3 x 10^-8 seconds to travel this distance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A signal sent by one of the methods demonstrated can be arranged to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arrive after a negative time delay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now, for some value of the signal velocity in between, the signal will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arrive instantaneously.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;An instantaneous signal cannot create a paradox.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Or, taking practical considerations into account, one arranged such that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it was *almost* instantaneous.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My question: could we 'get away' with using these methods to send FTL
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;signals for near-instantaneous communication over distances?
