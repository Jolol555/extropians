<P>Harvey, perhaps you could explain to me what this &quot;consciousness stream&quot; is.  I
<BR>
get the impression from your comments that this is what you would upload if you
<BR>
could upload.  But what is it made of?  Is it just bits?  If it is just bits
<BR>
that specify a computational process, does it matter if it gets run on some
<BR>
processor, or just contemplated by a simulation that ponders what would have
<BR>
happened if it were to be run?  And at what clock speed?  Would you still be you
<BR>
if you only get a few cycles each thousand years?  (Could happen if you have to
<BR>
time share with a few trillion other bifurcating &quot;streams.&quot;)
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, back at the Harvey that exists in wet ware,  what good does it do you
<BR>
to write this thing?  I understand the life insurance aspects if you drop dead,
<BR>
someone to dispose of your property and look after your family sort of like you
<BR>
would have done (unless uploaded Harvey decides that being able to surf the web
<BR>
24-7 without need for food or sleep is too engrossing to worry about less
<BR>
interesting stuff like exHarvey's physical family), but what does it do for you,
<BR>
you're dead?
<BR>
<P>At this point I expect you will want to trot out the old &quot;I don't know what it
<BR>
is, but if I gradually replace one neuron at a time, I will get there&quot;
<BR>
argument.  Yes, you will get somewhere, but until something is known about what
<BR>
this process does in real life, who can say who will be we.
<BR>
