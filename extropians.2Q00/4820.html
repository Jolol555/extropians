<EM>&gt; However, Robert Bradbury's ideas of dismantling solar systems is probably the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; epitome of 'paving over the universe', but this is  IMHO more a failing in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perceptions of others, because there is still the popular connotation that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Expansion = Progress = Development = Sprawl = 'Los Angelization' = Paving Over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Universe = Very Bad Thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While I like many of Robert's ideas on this score, I think that choosing what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be perceived as a Vogon-type attitude toward other worlds doesn't properly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communicate our true objectives. People are still stuck in ecological mindsets,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so I think that promoting the ideas of making the universe into our gardens and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parks is more positive and reflects our aspirations better. Damien's vision of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this in _The White Abacus_ is very much what I see as the sort of future many of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us want.

<P>Yes, Mike has the key point here (which I was half way to writing out in
<BR>
full when I nitpicked on the new age fluff) - don't let the limitations
<BR>
of others' understanding change how you present yourselves. Although
<BR>
your objective is to make everyone understand what you stand for, for
<BR>
most people their minds will be made up already however you phrase
<BR>
things. Hence, your priority should be to get your message across
<BR>
clearly to those who would join you - so that you can ensure you
<BR>
succeed in finding and identifying with those people.
