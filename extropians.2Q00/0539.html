<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Over several weeks ago, someone on this list made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comments to the effect that the &quot;Y2K Problem&quot; was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unique event never to be repeated. The reasoning was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, since storage space is now plentiful and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; databases routinely are able to store dates in formats
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that support the far, far, far future (I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember the details, but we were talking an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;astronomical&quot; number of years from now), there will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never again be a calendar event that threatens to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; break a significant fraction of computer programs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe an implication of the post I refer to was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that there will be no &quot;Y10K&quot; problem, for example.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since then, I have been sensitive to code which is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exception to this. That is, every time I see code that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would fail in Y10K, I notice it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And I have noticed code like this an awful lot. For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example, in Web development, it is common to pass data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to servers as parameters at the end of URL's. When
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; passing dates in URL's, the habit I see is to use a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; four-digit year. When I suggest that a five-digit year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be used (&quot;just for grins&quot;, I say), people just roll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their eyes at me. (People do that a lot.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eight thousand years is a long time to fix these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things, and it seems unlikely that there will even be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; URL's as we now know them in 9999 C.E., so I realize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is a mainly nitpicking, but it is NOT the case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that just because we have plenty of storage space and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; super-duper date fields in databases, there will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; therefore be nothing like Y10K problem. (I say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;nothing like&quot; because I accept the probability that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;Gregorian calendar&quot; will not be used for another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 8000 years.*) All it requires is &quot;shortsightedness&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which probably will never go away entirely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, isn't there some kind of limit on the internal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unix clock format? I remember hearing somewhere that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it only goes to something like 2038. If so, that seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a problem, although probably not a big one (I bet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the OS could be upgraded without having to change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application code).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -- M. Smith
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * Once, after being forced to write code for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; umpteenth time to determine the number of days in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given month, I ALMOST included a joke comment to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect that all months should have 28 days (4 weeks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly) to make programming easier, and TO HELL with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the phases of the moon and the rotation of the Earth!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So what if it meant your birthday would be in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different season every three years? Don't farmers have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; almanacs? Are there not more programmers now than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; farmers? Do not the needs of the many outweigh the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needs of the few?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, if there were 13 months of 28 days each,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that makes 364 days a year. It would take almost a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; century for your birthday to change seasons. Isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that close enough? And the 13th month could be named
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Smithember&quot;, because I thought of it! Yeah! And all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you people who were born on the 29th, 30th, or 31st
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would just be out of luck, no birthdays for you...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; See! You're rolling your eyes!
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, at least you would be giving plenty of 29 year old women an excuse to
<BR>
never age....
<BR>
The extra day and a quarter could be kept as Memory Leakage Day, and would not
<BR>
belong to a month. Of course, you could make Memory Leakage Day equivalent to
<BR>
February 10th, since I already own that day (in Lowell, Massachusetts, Feb 10th
<BR>
is Michael Scott Lorrey Day).
