Thats the typical british demand for capitulation. Trading &quot;Guns for peace&quot;
<BR>
seems to be the MO for some people on this side of the puddle too. Essentially
<BR>
the British want the Catholics to lie down like dogs before they will agree to
<BR>
discuss the idea that they possibly might acknowledge Catholics as potentially
<BR>
qualified to be human beings, so long as they totally subjugate themselves to
<BR>
the state and abdicate their individual human dignity. You folks tried that here
<BR>
in the US a coupla centuries ago too, as you might recall....Tell me, if the IRA
<BR>
had given up its guns decades ago, do you even think the Catholics would be even
<BR>
treated halfway as decently as they are today?

<EM>&gt;      the interesting statistic that something like 85% of the GB
