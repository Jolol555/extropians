<EM>&gt; I consider the pledge of allegiance to be falsely directed. The pledge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be directed toward the Constitution, a copy of which should be in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every classroom. I don't see this as a bad thing at all. Pledging allegiance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a flag, that can mean whatever the government and the media want it to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean, is a rather empty and mindless task.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think this is a very profound idea.  It deserves to be pushed forward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somehow.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've written to my congressmonsters about the idea already. How about
<BR>
you?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you continue:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You only deserve to die if you've proven you are unfit to live. The unborn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; haven't even been given the chance... a woman who aborts is admitting either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that she will be an unfit mother, or that she has so little regard for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life of others. Either way, its a toss up. Do you want to put a baby in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hands of someone like that? I don't, which is why despite my misgivings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the morality of it, I think abortion is the lesser of two evils. By
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aborting, she's making sure there are fewer people like her (and the father)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the world. Abortion and execution: I just call it evolution in action.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a touchy and complex issue.  I would prefer the child to be born and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least have an opportunity, no matter how limited, to have a life that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counts for something.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know. Thats the big thorn in my craw too. Though I think that having a
<BR>
life and making one's life count for something are two entirely
<BR>
different orders of magnitude.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some minority leaders have claimed that Planned Parenthood has a secret
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agenda to 'trim' poor and dysfunctional black and hispanic populations.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was quite surprised to read this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Frankly I wonder what took them so long to figure it out. Considering
<BR>
whats been disclosed about Margaret Sanger here on the list, I don't
<BR>
doubt that there may be a significant story there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike, quite honestly, you should be a radio talk-show personality.  If your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personality and intelligence comes through half as well as it does in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writings, you would be a serious contender.  You could be the Rush Limbaugh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of transhumanism!  ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, John, but I don't use Slim Fast and I don't still live with my
<BR>
mother... ;)
<BR>
Actually, I've thought about it.
