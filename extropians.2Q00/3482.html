<P>So lets evolve one.
<BR>
<P>Everyone on all sides of the transparency debate will agree: if we
<BR>
fail to compensate downward the authority of government as
<BR>
surveillance becomes easier and cheaper, then we are all...
<BR>
[what is the technical term I am serching for here?  Oh yes:]
<BR>
...fucked.
<BR>
<P>One angle I thought of that would make today different from
<BR>
previous u. surv. societies: in the past, the surveillors were humans
<BR>
hired to do a job.  They became overzealous in their
<BR>
prosecution because that was their perceived job.  Kinda like
<BR>
traffic cops having an unspoken quota of speeding tickets they
<BR>
must write.  Or they were just the kind of people who liked to
<BR>
kick asses for no good reason.  So they did.
<BR>
<P>As cameras multiply, we need fewer enforcers, consequently
<BR>
the few would use their limited resources in solving those crimes
<BR>
that which really pull in the profit: robbery, rape, murder, etc.
<BR>
We may begin to see the government more as a business than
<BR>
as the traditional big brother figure.
<BR>
<P>With big business we have the collective option of just saying
<BR>
no, or just saying less.  And we MUST exercise that option.
<BR>
<P>Please allow me to develop this a little further.  What if we
<BR>
gradually turned law enforcement over to private industry?
<BR>
Let us start with that area of law that every one of us violates
<BR>
routinely, traffic law.  {Except of course the short list of non-
<BR>
drivers here, Damien Broderick, John Grigg, Eliezer, et. al.}
<BR>
We speed.  We blow an occasional stop signs, we burn and
<BR>
occasional red light.  We do other minor naughties in our cars,
<BR>
do we not?  We seldom if ever get caught.
<BR>
<P>What if our cars were instrumented to determine and log
<BR>
speed, km driven, traffic conditions, etc.  Then instead of
<BR>
paying an occasional traffic fine, our driving safety would
<BR>
be determined by an insurance company, who would presumably
<BR>
take into account intangeable factors, such as the fact that
<BR>
there was no one about when you blew the red light, etc.
<BR>
Then the company determines your insurance rate depending
<BR>
on the number of close calls you caused, your speed, your
<BR>
general tendency toward or away from traffic anarchy, etc.
<BR>
Then if you dont like their offered rates, you are free to go
<BR>
purchase insurance from one of their competitors.  Everything
<BR>
would be strictly free enterprise, with the exception of one law
<BR>
that each driver would need to carry at least 100k in liability,
<BR>
not so different from what we have now.
<BR>
<P>Any takers?  Im a taker.  In the long run we would all
<BR>
benefit from such a system.  Of course we lose Queene's
<BR>
desire to feel the satisfaction of having gotten away with
<BR>
something.  I dont know what to say to that.  We wouldnt
<BR>
get away with *anything* however the penalty for infraction
<BR>
would not be large.  The occasional spirited jaunt to 150 kph
<BR>
on a deserted highway might cost you an extra 50 cents next
<BR>
time you renew your insurance for instance.  Any absent-
<BR>
minded talking-on-the-damned-cell-phone-induced near
<BR>
accident might cost you 50 to 100 bucks however.  And
<BR>
of course your bill would be roughly proportional to the number
<BR>
of km driven.
<BR>
<P>But this is only one example.  In the long run I could imagine
<BR>
where nearly all police work could be turned over to private
<BR>
enterprise.  Then government would then have potential
<BR>
competitors, thus breaking a long-standing power monopoly
<BR>
and the associated corruption and inefficiency.
<BR>
<P>What say ye, Mike?  spike
