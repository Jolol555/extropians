<EM>&gt; As I've stated before, and I'll state again, the limits on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cryonic reanimation would appear to be fundamentally based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the question of whether or not the freezing process causes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loss of positional information that could prevent 3D-reassembly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given the size of synaptic and cellular structures, I strongly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doubt that to be the case.  These are hundreds of thousands to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tens-of-millions of atoms in size.  They are only going to match
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up in unique places.  Only if you unfreeze the brain and let it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decay away into a molecular soup have you lost that information.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't want to fully reopen the debate we had a few weeks ago about
<BR>
this, but I do want to point out that this model makes most sense if
<BR>
you think of the tissue as being frozen and then cracked apart.  In
<BR>
that case the problem is putting the pieces back together, and as you
<BR>
say they would probably match up in unique places.
<BR>
<P>However in fact freezing is a dynamic, possibly chaotic process.
<BR>
Ice crystals grow and spread through the tissues like spears, providing
<BR>
signifcant mechanical stresses to cells that are still in the unfrozen
<BR>
state.  The chemistry of the intercellular medium changes drastically, as
<BR>
water freezes and the concentration of larger molecules rises.  The cells
<BR>
dehydrate as fluids flow through the channels or perhaps even through
<BR>
tears in the membrane, putting things into a highly unnatural state.
<BR>
<P>This whole process occurs before the local tissue actually freezes.
<BR>
Once everything gets vitrified and/or frozen, things will pretty much
<BR>
stay where they are, although there may be cracking and shifting at
<BR>
some scale.  But even before things are frozen there will be damage.
<BR>
All of that occurs in the fluid state, and putting things back won't be
<BR>
as easy as assembling a jigsaw puzzle.
