<EM>&gt; &gt; Is this really still true?  How many parts were actually in a Saturn 5?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  I would have to think that much of a Saturn 5 is nothing but big hunks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  of sheet metal, fuel tanks and some plumbing.  Size does not equal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  complexity.  The parts count on things like the 767 is in the millions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  (though most of the parts are rivets).  Then you have dozens of chips
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  out now in the 10-100 million transistor size range.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  I would bet that the complexity of the command module was greater than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  that of the Saturn 5 itself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Having walked around the prone carcass of the vehicle that was to have
</EM><BR>
been
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Apollo 19 at JSC many times and having a passing layman's familiarity with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the general design of the Apollo spacecraft, I'd say you're right on the
</EM><BR>
last
<BR>
<EM>&gt; score, certainly so if you include the Service Module in comparison to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Saturn rocket itself.
</EM><BR>
<P>So?  I'm only looking for a reliable, cheap heavy launch lifter -- not the
<BR>
most complex thing ever built.  Chances are, such a thing could be very
<BR>
simple compared to other machines humans have built.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the other hand, the complexity of the ENGINES was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty damned high -- amazing machines, they were, with lots of analog
</EM><BR>
logic
<BR>
<EM>&gt; built into the hydraulic systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>That may be so.  I'm not sure.  What would be the problems with using analog
<BR>
over digital in this area?  (Off hand, I can think of positive feedback
<BR>
being a big problem, but I imagine these engines were thoroughly tested and
<BR>
highly rated.  However, building them today is another matter.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  The minimum self-replicating bacteria, would seem to be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  do basic metabolism *and* self replication with a unique parts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  count of ~300.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  What should one use for *real* measures of complexity?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  For example, was the Apollo command module more or less complex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  than an Iridium Satellite?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good question -- I'd say likely more complex even with physical systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered alone, if only because of the broad range of function designed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the spacecraft, as well as the huge redundancy.  If you consider the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information systems, as well (embodied in the crew's training and the
</EM><BR>
ground
<BR>
<EM>&gt; support), the complexity of the CM far, far outstrips a modern comm sat.
</EM><BR>
<P>Complexity is mostly relative, I believe, though I imagine a raw absolute
<BR>
measure of complexity would be the number of parts a system has and their
<BR>
interrelations.  Still, how does one tell whether a system with x parts and
<BR>
y relations is more complex than one with x+1 parts and y - 1 relations or
<BR>
x-1 parts and y+1 relations?  (This is assuming that all these things can be
<BR>
discretely measured.)  Of course, it's easy in a lot of paradigm cases.  The
<BR>
Space Shuttle appears much more complex than, say, a toilet bowl -- and I
<BR>
think with good reason.  But when we venture far from those instances, what
<BR>
should guide us?
<BR>
<P>John L. Casti, in _Mind Rules_, argues that complexity is best looked at as
<BR>
relative to the system with which the complex system interacts.  (See vol.
<BR>
1, pp21-3.)
<BR>
<P>I imagine, too, that in regard to this discussion we should not be worried
<BR>
so much about complexity as just a pure theoretical construct, but in
<BR>
regards to how easy it is to design, build, use, repair, and maintain a
<BR>
space vehicle.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
