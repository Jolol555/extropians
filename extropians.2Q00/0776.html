Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>In these posts David Pizer addresses some questions in the area of net 
<BR>
connections(he is big on that!) and the possibility of having a small 
<BR>
astronomical observatory there.  He also writes about a website being 
<BR>
developed right now to promote the project.  A community greenhouse and 
<BR>
garden is another idea that is a real possibility.
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg

Subject: Pizerville project&gt;Hi David --
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Do you have a Web wite for this project yet?
</EM><BR>
<P>Mr friend, Forrest Munden, and I are starting an internet service provider, 
<BR>
E-store, web-site, and related items, business.  He has the beginning 
<BR>
expertise and energy, and I am funding it.  He is building a site for this 
<BR>
venture as we speak.  I hope he will jump in here and send more information, 
<BR>
to this address.  Mike Perry is working with him and will probably be 
<BR>
sending information on this soon.snip
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;This will involve a good repore with the coroner's office
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;and perhaps some legal work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think the word you're looking for is &quot;rapport&quot; (I like the ones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that today's spell checkers have *no* hope of fixing, especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when even an intelligent person with a dictionary who didn't know &gt;how to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spell the word couldn't find it to look it up).
</EM><BR>
<P>You are right. Thanks for the mention.  I apologize for my lack of spelling 
<BR>
skills. I realize it makes my posting harder to read and I try to look up as 
<BR>
many words as I know I have spelled wrong.  But surely a lot of mistakes 
<BR>
slip through.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Another 6 months after that and we should have stage 1 completed.  Do you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;want to make a reservation now :=)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;By the way, how much might land for houses and such go for in &gt;Pizerville?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know at this early stage what we will charge for sale or lease.  It 
<BR>
will depend on what the devolopment costs are to get the land ready to build 
<BR>
on.  There is land nearby, that has utilities and sewer that goes for 
<BR>
$25,000 or so, for an acre.
<BR>
<P>Within 5 miles there are available:  Medium size houses (say, 1500 sq ft) on 
<BR>
a large lot (say, 1 acre) turnkey ready in the $100,000 range.  The smaller 
<BR>
little homes on small lots start around $75,000.
<BR>
Although there is a lot of interest in buying, I still think when it gets 
<BR>
right down to it, there will be a lot of people who will rent or lease 
<BR>
because the rates should be real low, and there is no big investment needed 
<BR>
like in buying and building.  But we plan to offer both and see what the 
<BR>
cryonicists prefer.
<BR>
<P>Also, we will need rentals because even for those people who want to buy 
<BR>
land and build, I think they should rent for several months first, to be 
<BR>
sure they like the community before they make a bigger investment.

<EM>&gt;Subject: wish list for Dave Pizer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;What are the things you want?  Be specific!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Now is the time to post a list of what you would like to see &gt;&gt;avaiable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at this facility while we are in the planning stages.&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Post your wish 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;list.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I know about some tropical plants with &gt;interesting properties. &gt;Because 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the products they contain is not on &gt;the market, there is no &gt;other option 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that cultivate them... In a &gt;greenhouse  So this item &gt;would be usefull.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a nice idea.  Perhaps we should have a community green house and 
<BR>
garden area, with irrigation etc. where each resident could have a small 
<BR>
section of land to grow certain foods that they like????
<BR>
<P>I think you can grow apples and fruit (probably not citrus), grapes, corn, 
<BR>
potatoes, I'm not sure what else.  The elevation is 4,000 feet.
<BR>
One advantage to community garden, opposed to individual gardens, is that 
<BR>
each person could take turns working the whole garden for a day. So if there 
<BR>
are 20 participants in the community garden, each person would work the 
<BR>
whole garden only one out of 20 days and could come and go more often. I 
<BR>
don't know much about gardening, and part of the fun of a garden might be 
<BR>
working in it, so this idea may not be very good.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Do you know about Rimu trees?  There are some of them in California, &gt;what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about your location?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I have never heard of them.  What are they good for?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I am an amateur astronomer and telescope builder. Is there a possible 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;place for such an instrument (what diameter is possible?) Is there a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;heavy light pollution in the area?
</EM><BR>
<P>I have had several people suggest astronomy.  The night air is very clear. I 
<BR>
think it would be nice to have an astronomy building, even though it might 
<BR>
have to start out small.??
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Could be there a  technical workshop where big lasers could be built?
</EM><BR>
<P>I know nothing about this. I would like to hear more.  Also, the uses for 
<BR>
these at the commnunity, etc.  If there is a demand for this, we probably 
<BR>
can have it.  We would have to find out about zoing rules etc.  If it was 
<BR>
for hobby, and not for a business, then the zoning would not be an issue.
<BR>

<EM>&gt;What do you think about (computer) networking the entire community? If the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Using this backbone, community members would not only have the perks of

<EM>&gt;bio-statistics monitoring network, or something of that nature. I'm not

<EM>&gt;I am reposting this from the extropian list.  I thought Ryan had some good

<EM>&gt;ideas here.  David, what do you think?&gt;sincerely,&gt;John Grigg
</EM><BR>
<P>I think they are VERY GOOD ideas.  I am meeting with Ryan this Saturday to 
<BR>
discuss this further.  I hope he reports further after the meeting.
