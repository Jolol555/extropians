<EM>&gt; &gt; If your property trespesses on my property without your knowledge 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (i.e. if it is livestock that has gotten out of its pen starts eating my garden), then I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could still kill it IF it was causing damage to my property. Conversion only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; works with livestock, because of the so-called animal cruelty issue, and only if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; its not causing damage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are problems with this...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Recently cattle escaped  near where my son lives....they got on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; road....he was driving down that road....it was a muddy road....it was foggy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ker bam...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bent Pick up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Free Range....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The owner of the property....(cows) was not liable for the damage done to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; son's pickup...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>If that was the case, you should have been able to claim the carcass. A
<BR>
freind of mine had a similar case here in NH, and got the wildlife laws
<BR>
changed as a result. 
<BR>
<P>&lt;story follows&gt;
<BR>
Ol' Billy Donovan is an old retired refrigeration man, who has a cabin a
<BR>
few miles from mine in upstate Na' Hampsha'. Billy has a preference for
<BR>
his likker, and he loves to hang out with his buddy Captain Morgan, with
<BR>
or without ice or other fixin's. Now, Billy is a happy drunk, and
<BR>
because the roads get quite foggy often, he figgers that if its that
<BR>
foggy, then the cops can't see him driving in the middle of the road...
<BR>
Billy and his dear departed father had developed a reputation as men of
<BR>
a type who knew how to obtain wilderness delicacies in the off season,
<BR>
so he knew when opportunity presented itself in odd circumstances, and
<BR>
he was well known by the local constablulary for his predelictions, but
<BR>
he had been caught only once in his life. His hunting philosophy is &quot;If
<BR>
its brown, its down.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This one evening, he was riding the dashed yellow mono-rail home with
<BR>
his pickup from an evening of carousing. It was a foggy eve, so he had
<BR>
little to occupy his mind but Clint Black on the radio, about twenty
<BR>
feet of yellow monorail, and a viscous white blur of illumiated fog, as
<BR>
he drove down route 16 through the 13 Mile Woods. Suddenly, he sees a
<BR>
dark, large mass in front of him then THUMP!!! and he wakes up a few
<BR>
minutes later to find that he's totalled his pickup on the carcass of a
<BR>
Moose. Now, the Moose is still alive, but just barely, so he goes and
<BR>
puts it out of its misery, then gets on his radio and calls on channel
<BR>
13 for some assistance. 
<BR>
<P>Apparently the game warden had heard the report on the scanner, so he
<BR>
showed up a few minutes after the Errol constabulary, hoping to have
<BR>
caught Billy in another compromising position. Fortunately, the cops
<BR>
cleared him. He didn't get dinged for DUI, probably because they figured
<BR>
that he had totalled his truck anyways, so he wouldn't be driving for a
<BR>
long while as it is, then again, I doubt any of those cops had ever met
<BR>
Billy when he WASNT pissed to the wind, so they didn't have any base
<BR>
reference to rely on. Billy asked if he could take the carcass, but the
<BR>
Game Warden, who had had it in for Billy for years (they've had a
<BR>
backwoods version of Spy vs. Spy going for about thirty years by then),
<BR>
says &quot;No. The Moose herd in New Hampshire belongs to the state.&quot;  Billy
<BR>
thinks 'is that so?'
<BR>
<P>The next week, after recuperating, Billy gets on the horn with his local
<BR>
attorney, and says he wants to sue the state for the replacement cost of
<BR>
his pickup truck and his medical expenses. The Attorney asks why, and
<BR>
Billy explains the claims of the game warden, that the moose herd
<BR>
belongs to the state, and thus the state's property was obstructing
<BR>
traffic, causing a public nuisance and hazardous conditions. That
<BR>
sounded good, and eventually Billy won his case in court, and the State
<BR>
bought him his new pickup truck. At which point, the state changed the
<BR>
wildlife collision laws to allow people who hit deer or moose on the
<BR>
roads with their cars, etc. to claim the carcass as some sort of salvage
<BR>
right...
