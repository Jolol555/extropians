&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 29'th update on my fly longevity experiments.
<BR>
In run #26 I checked to see if an alkaline potassium salt can
<BR>
help reduce alcohol toxicity - result was negative. I also
<BR>
checked to see whether citric acid exerts any toxic side effects.
<BR>
I need to add 1/4 tsp to help prevent pathogen growth, but
<BR>
was curious to see if citric acid might itself reduce longevity,
<BR>
when enough alcohol is added to already eliminate pathogen
<BR>
growth. Citric acid proved to be non-toxic.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prior runs I have found pycnogenol exerts a temporary
<BR>
survival promoting effect. I was wondering if this effect was 
<BR>
short term  because of the antioxidants deteriorating.
<BR>
In run #27 I check to see if prior exposure for 2 weeks to 200 mg
<BR>
pycnogenol eliminates the benefit when fresh pycnogenol is
<BR>
then added. Unfortunely there were not enough flies to include 
<BR>
the bottle using the old pycnogenol laced fly food. In any case 
<BR>
due to the low mortality at the day 8 census, the results are 
<BR>
not robust enough to be decisive.
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally in an interesting recent experiment I tested the
<BR>
effect of one day exposure to 200 mg pycnogenol or wine on
<BR>
the ability of flies to survive various lengths of time in my freezer.
<BR>
After each period in the freezer, the flies had to be warmed up
<BR>
at room temperature to see they could start moving again.
<BR>
The poor result with alcohol was a surprise, and as a result no
<BR>
further experiments with alcohol are planned. Also unexpected
<BR>
was the apparent ability of pycnogenol to significantly boost 
<BR>
hypothermia/freezing tolerance. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In additional to further longevity experiments I plan
<BR>
additional &quot;low-tech&quot; cryobiology experiments. If I can find a way
<BR>
for flies to survive long periods in the freezer this would be a
<BR>
major advance, which might have commercial application
<BR>
with regard to transplant organs for example. (I can dream.)
