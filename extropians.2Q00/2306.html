<EM> &gt; However, this does not get you the 'transparent' society you wanted. It
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; doesn't help the government catch pot smokers, or sexual perverts, or anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; else whos 'crimes' are consensual. Real criminal will not film themselves,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and they will break or steal private surveillance systems when they can.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Criminal conspiracies won't keep recordings for you either, unless they are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; especially stupid. The list of wholes in the system goes on and on.

<P>I don't see how people can speak pro ubiquitous snoopware, without
<BR>
realizing how much information can be extracted from multiple,
<BR>
seemingly bland data sources by crosscorellation, especially if over a
<BR>
certain threshold. I'm not in the know in what extent data warehousing
<BR>
is currently already being utilized by security, whether fed or
<BR>
otherwise, but I'll bet it's a huge growth market.
<BR>
<P>The surveillance technology chillingly depicted in The Deepness In The
<BR>
Sky is not very far of, even without Focus (a fair likeness of which
<BR>
can be probably engineered, as well). Realtime surveillance tightly
<BR>
coupled to legislative and executive (especially, if combined in one
<BR>
entity) is a very deep local minimum. Once you're there, you'll have
<BR>
very hard time escaping from there. So, please, don't try to get there
<BR>
deliberately, dragging us all into it.
<BR>
<P>Anyone proposing an Open Society is IMO at least criminally negligent,
<BR>
if not outright evil.
<BR>
<P>Most of list subscribers probably don't understand the mechanics and
<BR>
the scope of control present in totalitarian states, not having lived
<BR>
in one. Why do you think it can never happen here?
