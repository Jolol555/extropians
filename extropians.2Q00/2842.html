<EM>&gt; I am deeply sorry to pass on the terrible news that Sasha Chislenko, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long-time extropian and friend of many here, died on Monday.
</EM><BR>
<P>I never met Sasha, and I never communicated with him personally.
<BR>
<P>On reading the news of his death, and the farewells posted by others
<BR>
here, I looked back through my mail archives for his messages, and
<BR>
visited his website.
<BR>
<P>I only joined this list recently. I was recieving the digest sent to
<BR>
transhumantech, and was intrigued by the conversations here. I joined so
<BR>
that I could read them in full and participate; looking back, I realise
<BR>
that it was many of Sasha's comments that encouraged me to do so.
<BR>
<P>On visiting his site, I recognised that I had done so before - never
<BR>
directly but to pages within it. I had seen a long time ago his
<BR>
collection of interesting mailing lists. Indeed, I was on some of them,
<BR>
and looking back through my archives I discovered messages him dating
<BR>
from long ago.
<BR>
<P>His presence had already reached me in many ways, and yet I never knew
<BR>
him. I know now from what you have all said that I missed my chance to
<BR>
meet a wonderful person and a brilliant mind. 
<BR>
<P><P>My regards and regrets,
<BR>
<P><P>Martin
