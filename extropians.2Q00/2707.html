from NewsScan Daily, 9 May 2000 (&quot;Above The Fold&quot;):
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;[...]HAS WAR OUTPRICED ITSELF?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       Military historian John Keegan believes the world may look forward to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a future of peace because war has reached a point where its costs far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;outweigh its benefits:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       &quot;War, it seems to me, [...] may well be ceasing to commend itself to human beings as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;desirable or productive, let alone rational, means of reconciling their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discontents.  This is not mere idealism.  Mankind does have the capacity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;over time, to correlate the costs and benefits of large and universal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;undertakings.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        [...] mankind can clearly be seen to have judged that war's benefits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;outweighed its costs, [ ... ] Now the computation works in the opposite direction.  Costs clearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exceed benefits.  [...]  The scourge of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disease has, almost within living memory, been very largely defeated and,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;though it is true that disease had no friends as war has had friends, war
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;now demands a friendship which can only be paid in false coin.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       &quot;A world political economy which makes no room for war demands, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;must be recognized, a new culture of human relations.  As most cultures of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which we have knowledge were transfused by the warrior spirit, such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cultural transformation demands a break with the past for which there are no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;precedents.  There is no precedent, however, for the menace with which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future war now confronts the world.
