<EM>&gt; &gt; Ahem: if we play this game, I'll have to cite the CIA's fun activities

<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;next dissident group&quot; is _already_ planting bombs -- it's nothing to

<EM>&gt; &gt; do with the Irish issue and everything to do with militant animal rights

<EM>&gt; &gt; protestors blowing up meat packing warehouses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ollie and the CIA never, to my knowledge killed anyone, up until the present
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; administration, who was an american citizen, with the sole exception of a few americans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who were assisting communist insurgents in central America, and they got offed by CIA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clients, not by the CIA itself. By definition, foreign communist geurillas are open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; season. Nobody in the White House ever ordered anyone to off an American, a market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contrast to the practices of the Intelligence Section over there...
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought you were a libertarian, Mike. Where is all this defensive
<BR>
hyperpatriotism coming from? The CIA is allowed to off communist
<BR>
insurgents by way of its clients, but the British government (a US
<BR>
client state) isn't allowed to off its own communist insurgents (the
<BR>
avowedly-Marxist pIRA) because they don't have the holy indulgence of
<BR>
the US state department?
<BR>
<P>People are human beings, Michael, whether or not they're citizens of
<BR>
the United States. Either you concede that governments -- your own or
<BR>
others -- have the right to kill them, or you don't. Personally, I don't
<BR>
think state violence is a good thing under _any_ circumstances; there
<BR>
may be mitigating conditions (such as, it's intended to prevent worse
<BR>
violence -- i.e., self-defense), but that still doesn't make it _good_.
<BR>
In fact, advocacy of state violence strikes me as being downright
<BR>
un-extropian. (Snark, snark.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &amp;28,000 equals, at a current exchange rate of 1 to 1.48, an income of $41,440.00.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Assuming you are single, you have an initial deduction of $5700.00. Thus your taxable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; income is $35,740.00. With no other deductions or writoffs, your tax would be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following:
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Wrong. That's the tax I pay on income _above_ 28K. On income _below_ 28K
<BR>
the rate is 25%. There's a marginal rate of 10% on the first couple of
<BR>
thousand, and a tax-free allowance of about 4.8K. On that first $41,440
<BR>
of income (US figures) I pay roughly $7000 in tax (don't have the UK IR
<BR>
tables to hand, can't be arsed calculating 'em by hand); this compares with
<BR>
the $8200 you'd pay, if single, in the US, going by the IRS table you
<BR>
cited.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you have any dependents, you would have additional deductions of I believe $2,000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each, thus lowering your taxable income and thus your tax bracket.
</EM><BR>
<P>Funnily enough, there are similar allowances in the UK tax system --
<BR>
only rather than being on the tax side, they're on the benefit side
<BR>
(automatic non-means-tested non-taxable state hand-out to parents with
<BR>
children, on a per-child basis).
<BR>
<P>Why are you so convinced that the USA is automatically and in every
<BR>
way better than anywhere else on the planet? It's just another goddamn
<BR>
country, and the rest of us don't all live in holes in the ground,
<BR>
subsisting off hand-outs and cast-offs.
<BR>
<P>(If the USA was a substantially better place to live -- combination of
<BR>
money, standard of living, and all the rest -- I'd emigrate; I speak
<BR>
the language, I've got highly employable skills, and unlike you I'm
<BR>
not incredibly attached to my country. But as far as I can calculate,
<BR>
the degree to which my life would improve is highly questionable, and
<BR>
I'd lose a fair bit, too. Some of us _like_ having five weeks a year of
<BR>
paid vacation -- never mind sick leave -- as normal working conditions,
<BR>
and not having to worry about medical insurance or burglars with guns.)
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; These days, the UK is approximately 7% non-white. Yeah, that's lilly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; white compared to the US. It is, however, a major departure from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; historical record.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True. I have asserted that the relatively low homicide rates over there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specifically because you don't have anywhere near the number of minorities as we do, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most homicide is minority on minority crime here. Its got nothing to do with guns,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while the lack of guns is specifically why your property crime rate is so high...
</EM><BR>
<P>Fairly predictably, the lack of firearms hasn't stopped gangsters getting
<BR>
their hands on them; there's a really nasty little turf war between a
<BR>
bunch of thugs from Manchester and their neighbours in Leeds right now
<BR>
(kneecappings, bodies found in car boots, that sort of thing). 
<BR>
<P>However, among petty criminals the issue is different. Anyone who goes
<BR>
housebreaking in the US is by definition fearless, and probably armed
<BR>
-- they know what they're likely to get. (This makes tackling a burglar
<BR>
extremely dangerous, but on the other hand, your chances of being burgled
<BR>
are relatively low.)
<BR>
<P>The perpetrators of burglary in the UK are different, because the risk
<BR>
is lower. You get opportunist criminals (teenagers and drug users) who 
<BR>
try to sneak through a window and steal a VCR or a handbag. If confronted
<BR>
they will run like hell and not fight back. Even if they're caught, the
<BR>
severity of punishment will depend on whether they threatened the home-
<BR>
owner -- armed robbery can land you a life sentence, whereas housebreaking
<BR>
can't (unless you turn it into armed robbery by waving a gun around at
<BR>
the almost-certainly-unarmed occupants). 
<BR>
<P>What this means is, comparison of burglary rates between the USA and UK
<BR>
are damn near invalidated because of the different conditions that apply.
<BR>
In the UK, burglary is very rarely a violent crime, but is more usually
<BR>
an opportunistic offense (like vandalism or theft from a car). There is
<BR>
no advantage, and many disadvantages, to a burglar going armed and 
<BR>
perpetrating violence. No criminal/victim arms race has gotten under way.
<BR>
<P>And you might take note that this is why the UK government is so dead keen
<BR>
on policing by camera -- dwellings are so close together that suspicious
<BR>
patterns of loitering (typical of an opportunist burglar) can be spotted
<BR>
easily.
<BR>
<P>Or at least, that's the theory ...
