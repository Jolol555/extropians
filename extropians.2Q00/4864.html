Cures of the future are growing on 'pharms' today
<BR>
Genetically altered goats are producing milk that contains drugs. Sales
<BR>
could begin in months.
<BR>
<P>By Andrea Knox
<BR>
INQUIRER STAFF WRITER
<BR>
CHARLTON, Mass. - The GTC Farm oozes a storybook charm, with its shaded
<BR>
brook, old-fashioned clapboard farmhouse, and gamboling goats that rush from
<BR>
their barns and thrust their noses over fences to inspect visitors.
<BR>
<P>But the aura of times past masks a scene straight out of a science-fiction
<BR>
future. This is no farm. It is a pharm, a 21st-century pharmaceutical plant.
<BR>
<P>In the hilltop laboratory, scientists inject goat embryos with strips of
<BR>
synthetic human DNA to create four-legged drug factories - animals that
<BR>
produce pharmaceuticals in their milk.
<BR>
<P>The goats are churning out 12 potential drugs, some of which are being
<BR>
tested in people.
<BR>
<P>One, a blood-clotting agent for use in heart bypass surgery, could be on the
<BR>
market by next year.
<BR>
<P>Opening a momentous new chapter in pharmaceutical history, this would be the
<BR>
first commercial drug produced in a transgenic animal - one that scientists
<BR>
have given a gene for a trait it doesn't naturally possess. The gene is
<BR>
inserted into a fertilized embryo, which is carried to birth in an adult.
<BR>
<P>The added gene in the GTC goats spurs the secretion of a protein that has
<BR>
potential therapeutic use in people.
<BR>
<P>And amid some unease about whether it's all moving a bit too fast, this
<BR>
pharm has plenty of company. Transgenic cows in Virginia and Wisconsin,
<BR>
sheep in New Zealand, and rabbits in Europe are making milk containing
<BR>
proteins that may one day be used as drugs.
<BR>
<P>Among the drugs are potential treatments for HIV, rheumatoid arthritis,
<BR>
Crohn's disease, and osteoporosis. There's a protein to help premature
<BR>
infants digest fats, and another to help in tissue repair. There's Factor
<BR>
VIII, which stops bleeding in hemophiliacs, and a therapy that's being
<BR>
tested against Pompe's disease, a rare genetic disorder that kills infants
<BR>
within months of diagnosis.
<BR>
<P>In every case, the protein is extracted from the animal's milk and purified
<BR>
into a treatment before being administered to patients in the traditional
<BR>
forms of pill, shot, or intravenous drip. The animals are killed and
<BR>
incinerated when their useful lives are over, so they do not become human or
<BR>
animal food and cannot be adopted as pets.
<BR>
<P>Although scientists have been adding genes to animal embryos for nearly
<BR>
three decades, no transgenic drug has yet been through enough human trials
<BR>
to assure that it is both safe and effective.
<BR>
<P>But several - besides the blood-clotting agent produced by the GTC goats -
<BR>
have shown enough promise that their developers expect to seek marketing
<BR>
approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration within two years.
<BR>
<P>The prospect that transgenic drugs might soon be a viable treatment option
<BR>
is a heady one for scientists and patient advocates, not to mention
<BR>
investors and entrepreneurs who have staked hundreds of millions of dollars
<BR>
and more than a decade of work on the technology.
<BR>
<P>They hold out hope that animal production could cut production costs of some
<BR>
drugs, although making no promises that the savings would be passed on to
<BR>
consumers. But they also say that transgenic animals could increase the
<BR>
supply of some drugs, including Factor VIII, and could produce new
<BR>
treatments that are impossible to make by other methods.
<BR>
<P>&quot;This is the drug-production technology of the 21st century,&quot; says George J.
<BR>
M. Hersbach, president and CEO of Pharming, N.V., a Netherlands company that
<BR>
is working with the American Red Cross on Factor VIII and is developing the
<BR>
Pompe's disease treatment with Genzyme Transgenics Corp. of Framingham,
<BR>
Mass., which owns the GTC Farm.
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's all about getting new drugs to people who need them, in a
<BR>
cost-effective way,&quot; adds Genzyme chief executive officer Sandra Nusinoff
<BR>
Lehrman. She estimates that in some cases, her goats can produce drugs for a
<BR>
quarter of what it would cost otherwise.
<BR>
<P>She also points out that it is quicker to expand production by breeding a
<BR>
few more goats than by building a new plant.
<BR>
<P>Skeptics, however, wonder whether the industry isn't rushing into unknown
<BR>
territory too quickly.
<BR>
<P>Margaret Mellon, director of the agriculture and biotechnology program for
<BR>
the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C., says: &quot;There are a
<BR>
lot of novel problems that come with treating animals as a drug production
<BR>
facility.&quot;
<BR>
<P>One issue is how to assure that no viruses or other infectious agents -
<BR>
including the prions that cause mad cow disease - creep into the finished
<BR>
products, Mellon says. The FDA has no regulations governing either
<BR>
transgenic animal health or the process of purifying drugs from milk, she
<BR>
notes.
<BR>
<P>The drug producers respond that they are meticulous in quarantining and
<BR>
testing their herds to assure that they are free of infection.
<BR>
<P>The FDA, for its part, points to the guidelines it issued in 1995 for drug
<BR>
production in transgenic animals, which cover both animal health and drug
<BR>
purification. These &quot;provide sufficient guidance on what we consider
<BR>
important,&quot; says spokeswoman Lenore Gelb, who says the agency has no plans
<BR>
to issue formal regulations on the topic.
<BR>
<P>The guidelines were written in consultation with the transgenic drug
<BR>
companies, which say they continue to discuss the issues with the FDA.
<BR>
<P>But guidelines aren't the same as regulations, says Mellon, and working them
<BR>
out in private discussions with industry excludes the public from the
<BR>
conversation.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Before these products start appearing in our pharmacies, there should be a
<BR>
much broader debate about whether they are needed and what standards are
<BR>
being used to assure safety,&quot; she says.
<BR>
<P>Mixing genes to create a drug-producing animal may still sound a bit
<BR>
fantastic, but it is built on a technology that is nearly three decades old.
<BR>
The first successful transfers of genes into mammal embryos were carried out
<BR>
in the 1970s, most famously by Ralph Brinster at the University of
<BR>
Pennsylvania.
<BR>
<P>By the late 1980s, the ability to create transgenic animals had moved from
<BR>
the research laboratory to the world of commerce, and Scotland's PPL
<BR>
announcing the first transgenic sheep in 1987. Still, the process was slow
<BR>
and building a herd big enough for drug-production was arduous until
<BR>
scientists got the hang of cloning in 1996, when Dolly the sheep was born.
<BR>
<P>The drug Genzyme expects to take to the FDA by the end of this year is
<BR>
antithrombin III, for use in heart bypass operations to make the clotting
<BR>
agent heparin more effective in some patients.
<BR>
<P>Next year, Pharming and Genzyme hope to request FDA authorization to sell
<BR>
the Pompe's disease treatment.
<BR>
<P>PPL Therapeutics Ltd. of Scotland has a target date of 2002 to enter the
<BR>
U.S. market with a protein, made by some of its 1,000 New Zealand sheep,
<BR>
that fights cystic fibrosis and congenital emphysema.
<BR>
<P>Sometime in the next few years, Centocor Inc., of Malvern, will seek FDA
<BR>
approval to use goats to expand production of Remicade, the drug it already
<BR>
markets to fight rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, an intestinal
<BR>
disorder.
<BR>
<P>The transgenic pipeline also includes collagen, a protein used by the body
<BR>
in tissue repair; fibrinogen, a protein that can stanch bleeding from
<BR>
wounds; additional rheumatoid arthritis drugs; and a treatment for
<BR>
hereditary angioedema, a potentially fatal swelling of tissues and organs.
<BR>
<P>Though this roster suggests the breadth of possibilities for transgenic
<BR>
drugs, many are still in early stages of development and may not pan out.
<BR>
<P>Development so far has cost hundreds of millions of dollars - Pharming has
<BR>
spent nearly $100 million and Genzyme has raised $180 million - and profits
<BR>
are still two to four years away.
<BR>
<P>If they come, companies may not pass lower production costs on to patients
<BR>
but may instead keep the profits. This could boost the share price,
<BR>
rewarding the investors who financed development but haven't yet earned a
<BR>
penny of return.
<BR>
<P>Pharming, for one, is cautious in promising lower costs. For Factor VIII,
<BR>
which induces blood clotting in hemophiliacs, &quot;the goal is to lower
<BR>
treatment cost, but that will depend on how efficiently we can make it, and
<BR>
we don't yet know that for sure,&quot; says CEO Hersbach. Factor VIII is now
<BR>
extracted from human blood plasma and made in cell culture. Animal
<BR>
production is expected to increase the supply and perhaps to lower the price
<BR>
to patients.
<BR>
<P>But the other promise of transgenics is to make more or better drugs
<BR>
available.
<BR>
<P>At Centocor, &quot;I think of transgenic production as a way [to generate]
<BR>
savings that can be invested into additional research on cures for other
<BR>
diseases,&quot; says Fred Bader, vice president for worldwide operations at
<BR>
Centocor.
