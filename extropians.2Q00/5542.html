<EM>&gt; Hi!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Seasonal riots? Really? Never heard of them. Do you mean riots in the big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;like LA once a decade???
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yep.
</EM><BR>
<P>They are not seasonal. They are set off by specific acts of the LA Police
<BR>
Department.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Note that the social and legal systems in cities like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;LA are as opressive as any european country (and far more racist).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I didn't know we lived in a oppressive society? A question: since Europeans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live in an oppressive society and legal system, how come we never riot as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it happens in LA? No racism?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know what kind of exaggeration you get on your media, but we see all
<BR>
kinds of rioting in the news going on in europe: the french on trade and labor
<BR>
reforms, the germans against immigrants, then you've got your organized violence
<BR>
in the Balkan states.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Cities that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;don't have such oppressive laws have very european level violent crime rates,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;while few places in the US have property crime rates at even a small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fraction of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the huge amount over there in europe. Moreover, non-gun violent crime in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;europe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;pretty closely matches that seen in most of the urban US, while suburban and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;rural violence is far lower.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe it was you who said that there is one gun for each American;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assuming that premise, measuring non-gun violent crimes in the US is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insignificant.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so. Only a fraction of violent crime here is gun related, and I did not say
<BR>
that every American has a gun. I did say that there were about 240 million guns
<BR>
in the US. Most gun owners own more than one gun. Moreover, not all gun owners
<BR>
carry a gun, and those with carry permits do not carry at all times.
<BR>
<P>Having a gun when contfronted with an armed criminal (knife, club, etc)
<BR>
increases your survivability by a factor of 2.5. on average.
<BR>
<P>I think many foreigners have a very different understanding of crime, based upon
<BR>
a story I just heard from the marketing guy here at Datamann from his trips to
<BR>
visit freinds in Rio:
<BR>
<P>His freinds are wealthy, and have a few guards on staff, their house is gated.
<BR>
However, more theives are armed with guns now, and will frequently wait by your
<BR>
gate, and stick you up there. He will make you open the gate, and follow you
<BR>
into your house, where he will rob everyone.
<BR>
<P>Andy asked one of the guards on staff what would happen if you didn't give up
<BR>
your stuff. The guard said, &quot;he will shoot you&quot;. Andy asked,&quot;What would happen
<BR>
if you gave him your stuff?&quot;. The guard replied,&quot;He will go away.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Andy said to the guard,&quot;Ah, so there are rules to crime here. In America, they
<BR>
will take your stuff and then shoot you as well.&quot; The guard looked horrified,
<BR>
and said,&quot;THATS not right!&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;New York fans are considered the rudest and most offensive fans in the US (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;recall all the Mariners/Yankees playoffs games I went to a 5 years ago, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;New York fans were throwing garbage on the outfield..The Seattle fans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;wanted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;go out and sort it for recycling...;) ), so if you were amazed at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;goings on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;at a New York game, then you would be stunned at a major league game in most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;other cities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I forgot to mention what is probably the major cause for non-violence in US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sports: geography. How many Pacers fans are going to LA to see the NBA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Finals tonight? 10, 20? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Er, no. The US is a highly mobile society, you will frequently see at least 10%
<BR>
of the spectators at a game being opposing fans in normal games. In playoff
<BR>
games there will frequently be 20-40% of the spectators being fans of the
<BR>
visiting team. Most fans are not geographically deterministic. I, for example,
<BR>
live in New Hampshire, but my favorite baseball team is the Seattle Mariners, my
<BR>
favorite football team is the San Francisco 49ers, my favorite hockey team is
<BR>
the New York Islanders.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It depends on including the players and their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relatives or not. Well, in European sports when, say, the major Portuguese
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clubs face each other, they can well have as high as 50'000 fans each in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same place; and there's when the problems begin. US sports fans are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never really in contact with one another, are they? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, they are, they frequently go to the games together.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps except the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Superbowl but that's an annual event where only the richest people go, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it doesn't really count. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Who is the richest? I know plenty of non-rich people who've been to the
<BR>
Superbowl. When I went to every game of the ABL playoffs the Mariners were in,
<BR>
including flying to New York City from Seattle, at the time I was definitely not
<BR>
'rich'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Actually, and since one of you mentioned Houston,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I remember some problems when the Rockets won the NBA a few years ago; or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was it when the Broncos won the NFL? I also remember that the Jazz fans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insulted with obsceneties the Bulls' players in the NBA Finals. So we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not that different, you just miss the fans confrontations because they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never meet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Such incidents are so rare, that they are news when they do occur.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;As to the rest of your post, Mike, I'll reiterate what I've said before about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the level of violence in the US: Most non-US folks have a wildly inflated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;idea of the level of violence here, based on our movies and the filter of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;own &quot;news&quot; media, re-amplified by the local media in their own country who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;further blow the violence here out of proportion.  I've had many fairly comic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;moments as a regular host of non-Americans on their first trips to the US,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;watching as they look for the burning buildings from the &quot;annual riots&quot;, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;running gun battles in the streets and the uninterrupted cross-country high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;speed car chases . . . they seem a little disappointed, I think, when it all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;turns out to be a glamorous exaggeration.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I actually saw the Miami police performing an arrest on my first trip to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the US; I've never watched an arrest in Portugal in my life. But my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal experience is not important. The fact remains that Washington has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the second highest murder rates of all cities worldwide not in a state of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; war (second to Rio de Janeiro). Of course that the US is not Beirut. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for me, a Portuguese used to a society with a very low level of violent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crimes, the idea that you can get into an argument with a driver or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever and he pulls off a gun is a scary one; something that is very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unlikely, to say the least, to happen in Portugal.
</EM><BR>
<P>Washington DC also has one of the most restrictive gun laws in the country. Name
<BR>
any other high crime city in the US, and you will find a city with extremely
<BR>
restrictive gun laws. As I've said before, almost everyone I have known
<BR>
personally that has visited europe has been robbed at least once while they were
<BR>
there, they've had their hotel rooms robbed, their cars broken into or stolen,
<BR>
and bags snatched out of their hands. The brazenness of theives in europe to me
<BR>
is incredible, and testament to the fact that they know there is little a person
<BR>
can do to defend themselves against robbery in europe. I've heard many stories
<BR>
of women mugged and raped with bystanders just walking by, ignoring what went
<BR>
on. Non-gun crime is so prevalent I beleive that most people there just don't
<BR>
see it, or refuse to see it.
