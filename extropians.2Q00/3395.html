<EM>&gt;&gt; Hell, yes, there are.  If I'm facing a choice whether to be copied, should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I expect this self-awareness to continue in the original?  Or continue in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; either the original or the copy, with a 50% probability of each?  If I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; facing a choice whether to step into the (Star Trek) transporter, then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; first possibility above would mean that my self-awareness would cease 100%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; of the time, and the second possibility would mean that my self-awareness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; would cease 50% of the time.  Neither of which sound very appealing to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; The end of my self-awareness, my sense of ego, is what I call &quot;death&quot;, nor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; is this merely a semantic matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But this is not a factual matter, in that there is no experiment you can do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which would settle it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you do step into the transporter, you will agree that someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;steps out.  He has all of your memories, experiences, habits, and so on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To him, it will feel like the transporter &quot;worked&quot; and did not eliminate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;his self awareness.  So this experiment will not answer the question for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;him.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And it will not answer the question for the body which steps into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transporter, because it's not around any more.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The issue is whether you want to call the guy who steps out &quot;the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person&quot; as the one who stepped in.  It's a semantic question independent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of any factual issues, as far as I can see.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Can you suggest any experiments, at the end of which you can say whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;copies preserve the self-awareness of the original?

Just for a moment lets ponder the transporter experiment. Modified so that it is a non destructive transporter.  Meaning &quot;I&quot; step on the transporter pad and bam in two shakes of a tail (or preferably a much smaller measurement of time)an exact duplicate of &quot;me&quot; appears some arbitrary distance away.  This entity has all my memories, facial hair, tattoos, receding hairline, etc.  To that entity the experience is rather like stepping through a door.  Both entitities could even meet and play chess if they wanted.  However, as for &quot;me&quot;, &quot;I&quot; am still here. Now we have two seprate entities. imho if you were to kill either one you would still be a murderer.  For both of us, what matters now is the particular point of view of the particular stream of conciousness that exists as a function of the individual entities existance.  Both of us would avoid a destructive Transport like the plague because we both see that we are in fact seperate entities and that destructive transport would therefore be suicide on the send si<BR>
de.

<P>Not really a strong logical argument, just the way &quot;I&quot; feel.

<P>&quot;Mr. Clark, you are under arrest for the serial murders of Harvey Newstrom.  You have the right...&quot;
