<P><EM>&gt;&gt; 2) If you are trying to dazzle her, then she might not find the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; space or opportunity to state her opinion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...how do you reach this possibility?  Getting her to state her opinions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is the purpose of the above.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Getting&quot;?
<BR>
<P>Are you in a hurry?
<BR>
<P>The joy of learning about people is creating an enviroment where
<BR>
things unfold naturally.  People reveal themselves in their own
<BR>
way, and in their own time.
<BR>
<P>Why not plant seeds and observe (really observe) and ask questions
<BR>
here and there and see where they lead?
<BR>
<P>Attaching yourself strongly to the outcome may be like pushing
<BR>
on a rope.
<BR>
<P>I like learning about someone new (whatever kind of new friend that is)
<BR>
by putting myself in a mode where everything is fresh and it's like I
<BR>
have a new toy with which to play. Something quite precious.
<BR>
<P>You could try drawing the girl out by imaginging that she is your
<BR>
sister that you have not seen in 10 years, and you're genuinely
<BR>
interested in learning how her life has been all these years. It
<BR>
might be a warmer enviroment with which to learn about each other.
<BR>
<P>And personally I'm not that interested in participating in strong
<BR>
discussions about economics and politics because I went through those kinds
<BR>
of debates in my 20s, earlier 30s, and I feel that I hammered out pretty well
<BR>
the baseline of my personal worldview. My life shows alot without
<BR>
any need to explain or debate(?).
<BR>
<P>I wrote my previous message in order to show that the approach that
<BR>
I've seen/experienced used alot by bright guys might seem to the woman to
<BR>
be a bit arrogant and overwhelming. She's observing  and filtering
<BR>
(quite a lot) too, but her interests, methods (and goals)
<BR>
are likely to be different.
