<EM>&gt; &gt; I think you have a point here, although I don't think this is the most

<EM>&gt; &gt; important difference between art and science. Science is constrained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by reality (or rather, it *seeks* constraints), while art has few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; constraints ( mainly some cultural and a few technical constraints)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and actively tries to avoid them.  Engineering is similar to art in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this respect, although it is constrained by a deliberate purpose it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has to achieve.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wouldn't say it quite that way--art that avoids constraints is crap,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like most free verse or abstract visual art or interpretive dance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Great art thrives on constraints: sonnets, realistic visual art, ballet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The constraints, though, are chosen by the artist.  Picasso certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chose different constraints from Michaelangelo, but he did hold himself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the standards he chose.

<P>Science seeks to determine the rules (patterns) of the current reality.
<BR>
Engineering seeks to produce machines that operate at the limits those
<BR>
rules allow.  Art seeks to define patterns of reality and explore the
<BR>
phase spaces they allow.  Given the human mind is a pattern recognition
<BR>
machine, it would be difficult to imagine true &quot;art&quot; that did not have
<BR>
an underlying set of constraints.  Whether it is Picasso or Escher
<BR>
or Erte or Warhol, they have to follow a pattern or else the human
<BR>
mind doesn't &quot;grok&quot; it.
<BR>
<P>Where its all going to go haywire is when the reality becomes
<BR>
virtual and the barriers between art and science are dissolved
<BR>
by engineering and we are allowed to edit the pattern recognition
<BR>
criteria.
