<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Actually the fundie line is that that was a different &quot;dispensation&quot;.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the death and resurrection of Christ, we are now in the dispensation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;grace&quot; and those old rules that are *really* hard to live by don't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; count anymore.  Granted there is nothing in the text of the scripture 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sanctions this, but come on we can't go around stoning our kids for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; insubordination in this day and age, now can we?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So what about the fun stuff in the new testament? You've got the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anti-witch stuff, of course, so I'd like to know what the proper way is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to 'suffer not a witch to live'? Do I crucify her (a Roman method
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reserved for political enemies and traitors) or burn her, or what?
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually that's old testament.  The new testament is a lot more touchy-feely 
<BR>
than all that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there are the anti-capitalist bits, like when Christ rampaged against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the merchants in the temple (rather reminiscent of the degree to which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the names of all the new sports stadiums are sporting corporate names,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eh? Sports is the national religion, right? Notre Dame and all..)
</EM><BR>
<P>That wasn't so much anti-capitalist, as separation of church and capitalism. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing he was pissed about was the fact that they were doing business 
<BR>
*on* temple property during a holy day.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you've also got the part where Jesus tells his followers to sell their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clothes and go naked in order to buy a sword. So S&amp;M is ok with God?
</EM><BR>
<P>He didn't tell them to go naked.  If that was part of the scripture I might 
<BR>
not have left the faith :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Then there's the part of 'giving to ceasar what belongs to ceasar'. God
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fearing people shouldn't bitch about paying their taxes then.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is what Christ is reported to have said and, as far as I know, its 
<BR>
still part of Christian teaching.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;question is, how much belongs to ceasar?
</EM><BR>
<P>That, I believe, is up to Ceasar.
