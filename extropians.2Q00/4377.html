<EM>&gt;I LOVED your post.  It echoes something I've come to appreciate in the last

<EM>&gt;couple of years, especially the last few months; that is that consciously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cultivating behavior aimed at a SLOWER pace has substantial benefits in many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aspects of my life.  In particular, I've come to appreciate working in the

<P>This sounds an awful lot like you are just changing as you get older.
<BR>
Evolution has programmed humans to express different genes at different
<BR>
ages, which changes both obvious things about our bodies and less
<BR>
obvious things about our minds.  We are in many ways just different
<BR>
people when we get older, with different abilities and preferences.
<BR>
<P>People seem to talk all the time about how they &quot;discovered&quot; things
<BR>
about what they liked at certain crucial ages, whereas it seems much
<BR>
more likely to me that they just changed.  Thing of how differently sex
<BR>
is to you at age 18 versus age 10.  This isn't because you learned new
<BR>
insights at age 15, it is because hormones were expressed that literally
<BR>
made you a different person.  Well changes in hormones don't stop at
<BR>
age 18, they continue all the way through life.
<BR>
<P>For example, this article describes how evolution should make time
<BR>
preferences change with age, including how  &quot;young adults should
<BR>
discount the future more rapidly than their elders&quot;.
