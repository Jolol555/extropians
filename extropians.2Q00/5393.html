(this is a reply to &quot;RE: &quot;, about whether people leave religion suddenly or 
<BR>
gradually)
<BR>
<P>Never having been religious, I can't provide much personal insight, but 
<BR>
among people I know who have told me, it always seems to have been a 
<BR>
situation where there were gradual components, but then there was one even 
<BR>
or instance when they *really* gave it up.
<BR>
- A friend of mine was raped, went to her bishop (Mormon) to confess about 
<BR>
it, he said things like &quot;you knew what was going to happen when you let him 
<BR>
into your room when your parents were on vacation and now you're just trying 
<BR>
to say it wasn't your fault because you feel guilty&quot;, she never went to 
<BR>
church again and had a lot less respect for the religion after that, but it 
<BR>
was only after studying it for a while that she came to the more ontological 
<BR>
conclusion that was false.
<BR>
- Another friend was born outside Utah, and then moved here to go to 
<BR>
college. I'm not sure how pervasive the Mormon religion is in everyday life 
<BR>
if you're a minority, but she said that it was definitely different here. 
<BR>
She had a mental breakdown (she didn't give me any details on this), and 
<BR>
then one day was just sitting and thinking about it, went out and bought a 
<BR>
coffee maker (Mormons cannot drink coffee), and never went to church again.
<BR>
- My dad was Catholic and went to Catholic school. One day a priest came to 
<BR>
talk to his class (it was in elementary school) about foul language. The 
<BR>
priest had a chart which detailed how long you will spend in purgatory for 
<BR>
each bad word you say. For example, it said something like &quot;S---        60 
<BR>
days&quot;, &quot;F---        120 days&quot;. My dad remembers thinking that that's pretty 
<BR>
steep for a God who is supposed to be forgiving, and also wondering how the 
<BR>
priest came to know this information, since it doesn't seem to be mentioned 
<BR>
anyplace in the Bible. He came to the conclusion that it was pretty much all 
<BR>
a bunch of bullshit.
<BR>
I imagine that people who come into religion have similar experiences, they 
<BR>
have something going bad in their lives, they want someone to tell them that 
<BR>
it's all ok, they ponder religion for a few moments then reject it, and one 
<BR>
day, maybe after something particularly painful, or maybe after having a 
<BR>
very emotional experience with a religious person, they &quot;know&quot; that God is 
<BR>
watching them and they drop all their resistances.
<BR>
Come to think of it, I bet that most serious changes in beliefs are this 
<BR>
way: a sudden paradigm shift, accompanied by small changes in the details of 
<BR>
your beliefs before and after the shift. I remember being in flux about gun 
<BR>
control (but more for it then against it) until reading an essay which 
<BR>
framed the debate in a way I had not considered before. Same with quantum 
<BR>
physics, I used to be fairly certain that the evidence for psychological 
<BR>
effects in determining a quantum state were very solid, and that this said 
<BR>
something profound about the relationship between mind and matter. There 
<BR>
were certain things that needed to be accounted for, but overall the 
<BR>
evidence for this seemed so strong that there could be no other explanation, 
<BR>
then I read about something called &quot;the transactional approach&quot; which 
<BR>
explained it without mental effects, and since then I've found myself losing 
<BR>
beliefs which relied on mental effects as a premise.
