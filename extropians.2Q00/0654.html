From: Matt Gingell &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mjg223@is7.nyu.edu?Subject=Re:%20Pol:%20Reaction%20to%20Microsoft%20Ruling&In-Reply-To=&lt;200004121422.HAA13602@well.com&gt;">mjg223@is7.nyu.edu</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;All real power is based in force or the threat of force, and all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think you're pointing out here is that we've granted a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on physical coercion to our elected government. That's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;treacherous, of course, like any concentration of power, but in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the end I don't see what the other options would be. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually the Federal Government was never granted a monopoly on
<BR>
force. The Second Amendment is specifically designed to prevent
<BR>
such a monopoly. When your individual citizens have the right to
<BR>
keep and bear arms, and the right to organize into militias, the
<BR>
governments ability to use force is limited.
<BR>
<P>They hate this which is why all the attempts at curtailing citizens
<BR>
rights to own guns, especially those of equal power.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I object to the us-versus-them character that discussion of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government has in so many of these debates. Government is us -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's elected by us and made up of us - it's not some alien force,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some evil monster out to crush all that's good and free in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;world. I have faith that most people in government are just like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you and me, and most of them believe in what they're doing and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;honesty feel they're doing what's right - even when I disagree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with them.
</EM><BR>
<P>While I agree that there are many good people working for the
<BR>
government, I disagree that it's not some alien force. The
<BR>
government is out to get it's own way, which rarely seems to
<BR>
coincide with my needs.
<BR>
<P>Like a jungle at the edge of a civilized area, you need to keep
<BR>
hacking at it to prevent encroachment.
