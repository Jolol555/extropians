</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Popularizers of science are seldom highly regarded in their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fields.  [Richard Feynman excepted of course.] 
</EM><BR>
<P>Gould himself is highly regarded in his field, as is Dawkins, though both 
<BR>
are also good popularizers.  In the local extropian reading group, we have 
<BR>
read several books by and about each.  They represent distinct camps in 
<BR>
biology and evolution, and are each considered a spokesman and inventive 
<BR>
thinker for their camp.  They have a fair amount of respect for each other 
<BR>
for their respective accomplishments, even though they disagree deeply 
<BR>
about what's important about evolution.  The fact that they both write 
<BR>
books for the public seems not to be held against them in their community.
<BR>
<P>I find myself in agreement with Dawkins nearly all the time, and it took me 
<BR>
a while to see the value in what Gould has to say, and to recognize the 
<BR>
respect he garners from his peers.  I still disagree with Gould, but I no 
<BR>
longer consider him merely a popularizer.  If you do, then I think you 
<BR>
don't understood sufficiently one of the big current controversies among 
<BR>
professional biologists specializing in evolution.   It's well worth 
<BR>
reading Gould himself or &quot;The Third Culture&quot; by Brockman.
