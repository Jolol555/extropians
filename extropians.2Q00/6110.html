<EM>&gt;&lt;&lt; In regards to this whole thread:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Just stop.  It has no value.  Let's move on to more progressive thoughts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and discussions.  What else matters? &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So far I merely &quot;sense foot in mouth disease&quot;, rather then active hatred.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I see this whole thread as being an example of e-communication gone 
<BR>
bad.  It has gone far beyond the original discussion and has 
<BR>
degenerated to a reputation salvaging mission for everyone.  The very 
<BR>
fact that all postings are being made publicly is because the 
<BR>
participants are no longer speaking to each other, but are posting 
<BR>
exposition to the rest of the list.  Each side is casting their own 
<BR>
position in the best light, while casting the opposing position in 
<BR>
the worst light.
<BR>
<P>I see (unintentional) exaggeration and misinterpretation on both 
<BR>
sides.  Although not deliberate, both sides have reacted 
<BR>
disproportionately to certain statements.  Items that were minor or 
<BR>
meaningless have been taken as intentional insults.  Attacks have 
<BR>
been made upon some statements that were throw-away lines or even 
<BR>
unrelated or content-free filler.
<BR>
<P>This really should be taken off-line.  The postings made for the 
<BR>
benefit of the list audience have distorted the discussion beyond all 
<BR>
recognition.  I suggest that all three parties apologize to the list 
<BR>
for having a heated discussion in the public forum.  It doesn't 
<BR>
matter who started it or who was right, I think you can all three 
<BR>
agree that all of your postings have continued this discussion on the 
<BR>
list. Hopefully, you can call three agree to take it off-list for 
<BR>
private resolution.  Then, when you get off-line, I suggest that you 
<BR>
all three apologize for the heated manner in which you have responded 
<BR>
to each other.  All three of you have overreacted to statements that 
<BR>
were not as harsh as your reactions indicated.  In the privacy of 
<BR>
your off-line discussions, you should be able to start the discussion 
<BR>
from scratch with simple statements of fact.
