subtopic: &quot;extermination of the human race&quot;
<BR>
<P>Professor Hugo de Garis, physicist, lately of Melbourne and now of Kyoto
<BR>
in Japan, fears that his experiments may ultimately lead to the
<BR>
extermination of the human race. What do you think?
<BR>
At the Kyoto Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute, Professor
<BR>
de Garis switched on a machine with which he will build the world's
<BR>
first neural circuits for a true artificial brain.
<BR>
In the next 12 months the cellular automata machine (CAM) in his
<BR>
laboratory will create a device composed of 75million silicon neurons,
<BR>
similar in capability to those in a human brain.
<BR>
The neuron networks are built up so that their connections are random,
<BR>
as they are in the human brain. Most of them fail in production and are
<BR>
discarded by a system based on Darwin's theory of evolution. Even so,
<BR>
the circuits are built, tested, accepted or rejected at blinding speed,
<BR>
many thousands every minute.
<BR>
When it is finished some time in 2001, this artificial brain or
<BR>
&quot;artilect&quot; will go into a four-legged robot called Robokitty.
<BR>
<P>By then work will have begun on the next generation of the artificial
<BR>
brain which, Professor de Garis says, could be finished about 2007 and
<BR>
would have more than 10 billion neurons. This would bring it to about
<BR>
the level of a village idiot but within reach of the 23billion organic
<BR>
neurons contained in the cortex of a human male (19 billion in a
<BR>
female).
<BR>
Then comes the third generation, which Professor de Garis expects to be
<BR>
finished about 2011 - a fearsome creation of 1000 billion neurons,
<BR>
vastly larger than that
<BR>
of a human.
<BR>
&quot;By then,&quot; says this unconventional Australian, &quot;I expect we'll be in a
<BR>
debate about whether we should proceed any further.
<BR>
&quot;Long-term I am very worried about the political impact of brain
<BR>
building.
<BR>
&quot;Since I am helping to pioneer this brain-building field, I feel a
<BR>
strong moral obligation to stimulate discussion on this enormous
<BR>
question.
<BR>
<P>Do we allow the artificial intellects to take over or not?&quot;
<BR>
Futurologists, such as the American computer engineer and author Ray
<BR>
Kurzweil, agree with him. While they themselves are riding and driving
<BR>
the technological revolution, they also see its scary side.
<BR>
A massively powerful artificial brain could easily develop contempt for
<BR>
its comparatively puny human makers, says Professor de Garis, who
<BR>
predicts that such a question could be this century's burning issue.
<BR>
On one side will be those afraid of the consequences of the science. On
<BR>
the other those who see it as part of human destiny and who say that if
<BR>
artilects are created by humans, then humans can set the boundaries for
<BR>
the artificial intelligence.
<BR>
<P>Professor de Garis is not so sure about humans retaining control,
<BR>
particularly when it comes to a silicon brain 40 times smarter than your
<BR>
average man. These, he says, should be coming out of the CAM machines by
<BR>
the second half of this century.
<BR>
Some see parallels with the debate raised by the cloning of Dolly the
<BR>
sheep.
<BR>
The CAM machine with which Professor deGaris is working was built by
<BR>
Genobyte, a US company based in Boulder, Colorado. It produces
<BR>
microscopic modules on silicon chips each of about 1000 artificial
<BR>
neurons. Such electrical connections in our human brains control our
<BR>
movements, our senses and, perhaps most ominously when it is seen in an
<BR>
artificial environment, our emotions and our imaginations.
<BR>
<P>In his profile on his personal website, the professor says: &quot;My dream in
<BR>
life is to build artificial brains with billions of artificial neurons,
<BR>
and see brain-like computers become a trillion-dollar industry within 20
<BR>
years.&quot;
