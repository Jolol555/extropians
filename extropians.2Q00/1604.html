<P>Bought! Where's my English;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Not everyone in the industry shares our views.  But, you're right, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an interesting problem.  What kind of business models could one create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to turn our particular dreams into reality?  I know of a few myself (for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instance, there's a professor who came up with a business plan to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bootstrap lunar industry into existence; too bad he's content to just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use it to teach a course, rather than trying to get funding and turn it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into reality), as well as numerous non-profit prize foundations (prizes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for nano, the X Prize, et cetera).
</EM><BR>
<P>I see your point, Adrian, but I was referring to transhumanists starting to 
<BR>
spread their political vision. It is quite difficult indeed to start up a 
<BR>
business in those high- risk ventures that we transhumanists/extopians often 
<BR>
speak about. Most of the research in those sectors are done by very big 
<BR>
companies or very big institutions (because they are costly and difficult 
<BR>
studies). On TransVision 1999 here in Stockholm, an interesting point was 
<BR>
made. In comparison to TransVision 1998 we rather discussed the political, 
<BR>
economical, socialtal effects of transhumanism, rather than the development 
<BR>
of the technologies themselves. Because that's where I think that we 
<BR>
transhumanists will make a difference, in formulating the political thoughts 
<BR>
for this century that can apply themselves to the new technologies and to a 
<BR>
constant dynamism in society. I'm not saying this to discourage those of you 
<BR>
out there that are already working in these sectors (keep it up BTW), but to 
<BR>
point out that we transhumanists really have to be &quot;the friends of the 
<BR>
future&quot;, contructing a philosophy and a cultural movement that can oppose 
<BR>
the onslaught of stasist forces. What good does it do to research when 
<BR>
you´re opposed at every step?
<BR>
<P>Transhumanism has been very bad at understanding the consequences of its own 
<BR>
philosophy, our opponents have been much better at it. Since the &quot;old guard&quot; 
<BR>
of the ExI left this list it has often degenerated into quite 
<BR>
inconsequencial ramblings. This is because of a lack of understanding of our 
<BR>
own ideology. This presents are very bad face to potential investors and 
<BR>
sympathizers. In short: it has become a geek club. Sorry, but that's the 
<BR>
truth why transhumanism isn't recruiting new groups and new social strata 
<BR>
than younger middle- class white males often very centered on science. But 
<BR>
those persons cannot give the movement the momentum it needs. What should be 
<BR>
done then?
<BR>
<P>I think this is very much up to the members- we have to be better informed 
<BR>
of our own ideology, we need to focus on studying the real consequences of 
<BR>
the technologies and changes we want, and we need to break down the pyramids 
<BR>
of our organisations. Strangly enough, transhumanism across the world have 
<BR>
become very similar to old clubs. A few on the top doing all the work, and 
<BR>
the rest waiting passively for the top to do things. But when the top leaves 
<BR>
(for one reason or the other) the organisations are crippled, and unable to 
<BR>
construct a new activity or ideological platform.
<BR>
<P>We' re not into this to play a bit with computers, we're in it to change the 
<BR>
world!
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
