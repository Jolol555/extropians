<P><EM>&gt;Another possibility along the same lines and more widely suggested, is that

<EM>&gt;males will eventually be useless as women breed through cloning.

<P>But it would also mean that men could reproduce without women, perhaps
<BR>
making women &quot;obsolete&quot; for breeding.  Neither gender would need the other,
<BR>
and in the case of Homosexual couples, they might rather not have the
<BR>
involvement of the opposite gender.  It's funny, but I've noticed that when
<BR>
such ideas as the &quot;uselfulness&quot; of a particular gender come up in the
<BR>
media, it invariably seems to be the men who are assumed will go the way of
<BR>
the dodo.  It might well be the concept of gender that does the dodo, not
<BR>
the actual gender.
<BR>
<P>I'd say it would lead to increased freedom for women, certainly giving an
<BR>
improved standing as they may not been seen as &quot;baby making machines&quot; any
<BR>
more by those who would hold such opinions.  The idea that &quot;women are only
<BR>
good for making babies&quot; might end up being viewed as a very very funny old
<BR>
concept.  It might be seen that they are far more effective teachers,
<BR>
politicians, carers, leaders than they are incubators.
<BR>
<P>As for places such as Afghanistan, women there might be denied it in order
<BR>
to try an maintain &quot;control&quot; of them, forcing them to go through the pain
<BR>
and risk so that they &quot;know their place&quot;.  I hope for radically improved
<BR>
social conditions there before this becomes available.
