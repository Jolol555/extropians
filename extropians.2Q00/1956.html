Greetings!

<EM>&gt; I believe -- can't find the reference -- some Asian scientists cloning mice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did find a correlation between donor age of the nucleus and the chances of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creating a viable clone.
</EM><BR>
<P>That would be a useful bit of information.  What would be *very* interesting
<BR>
would be to compare clones produced from normally dividing cells, such
<BR>
as intestinal cells as I believe was the case with Dolly, cells with
<BR>
replicative potential (liver), and non-dividing cells (neurons, muscle, ???).
<BR>
The question is whether the non-dividing cell can be dedifferentated
<BR>
back to a dividing state.  If you could do that, then you could use
<BR>
cells from young, middle-aged &amp; old animals and really get a handle
<BR>
on the degree to which mutation accumulation damages genome integrity.

<EM>&gt; &gt; That's even more direct evidence. I grant you it still doesn't prove the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; entire animal will live longer but it does give considerable weight to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that idea; and a increase from 61 to 93 divisions is not small and is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; theoretical, it's a concrete experimental result.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mice having shorter telomeres at birth do not live less than controls. There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is no correlation between in vitro doubling potential from cells taken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post-partum and life span. Therefore it is unlikely that we will witness a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 50% or close increase in the life span in these animals. I personaly am more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interested in seeing the results from Blasco's knock in telomerase mice.

Joao, you may know the answer to this.  Wasn't there a report
<BR>
(perhaps from Univ. of Hawaii?) that telomerase knockout mice *do*
<BR>
show signs of inability to develop and/or accelerated aging after
<BR>
3-4 generations?  If that is true, it might suggest that normal
<BR>
telomere lengths in adults would be sufficient to develop 2nd
<BR>
generation and perhaps even 3rd generation organs from stem cells
<BR>
remaining in the adult body, *without* the necessity of lengthening
<BR>
the telomeres through cloning or other processes.  Presumably
<BR>
more terminally differentiated cells (that have gone through
<BR>
more cell divisions) would be a poorer source material due
<BR>
to shorter telomeres, *if* you could regress them to a
<BR>
stem cell state.  Now, given the shorter telomeres in humans
<BR>
it would be unclear whether the stem cells in adult humans
<BR>
could be used to grow replacement organs.
<BR>
<P>What we need is the # of cell generations required to produce
<BR>
a 3-5 kg organ from a single cell, the normal adult human telomere
<BR>
length and how much each cell division subtracts from the telomeres.
<BR>
