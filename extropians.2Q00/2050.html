Those racist &quot;friends of humanity&quot; wrote to Max:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;YOUR NAME HAS RECENTLY BEEN ADDED TO THE NATIONAL REGISTRY OF KNOWN AND 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;SUSPECTED MUTANTS:
</EM><BR>
<P>Not Max More! No way! lol!!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Unknown has listed the following reasons for submitting your name to &gt;the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;National Registry of Known or Suspected Mutants:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You frequently exhibit behavior or traits associated with the &gt;genetically 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;altered. These traits include the tendency to get into the &gt;heads of others 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and elevate the energy level of a room.*
</EM><BR>
<P>I have heard you really have this power.  Especially at Extro conventions!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It has also been noted that you often demonstrate highly developed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;intelligence.
</EM><BR>
<P>I once tried reading your doctoral dissertation, so I can't argue with the 
<BR>
words above!!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In addition to the above, a number of unexplained phenomenas such as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;increased hormonal response have been documented and traced back to &gt;your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;presence.
</EM><BR>
<P>But, nothing when compared to the effect the guys from the band N'Sync have 
<BR>
on teenage girls!! lol!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Unusual physical characteristics such as your perfectly toned &gt;musculature 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have been analyzed and confirmed by our mutant profiling &gt;experts as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mutant-positive.*
</EM><BR>
<P>Now, this post is really going to swell your head!! ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Additionally, your peers have filed complaints that they sometimes feel 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;hot and tingly when in close proximity to you.
</EM><BR>
<P>You must have the mutant power to make people near you feel like they have 
<BR>
just eaten those potentially lethal Japanese pufferfish that are such a 
<BR>
delicacy!
<BR>
<P>If you believe that you have been wrongly identified, follow this 
<BR>
<EM> &gt;link:<A HREF="http://mutantwatch.com/quiz.html">http://mutantwatch.com/quiz.html</A> to complete a brief diagnostic &gt;test 
</EM><BR>
to clear yourself. &gt;=================================================&gt;-The 
<BR>
Genetically Pure &gt;Patriot Brigade Proud to Support the Senator Kelly 2000 
<BR>
Campaign &gt;=================================================&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>I sure hope Ralph Merkle, Carl Drexler and Eliezer Yudkowsky don't accept 
<BR>
research money on behalf of these people to build giant &quot;sentinal robots!! 
<BR>
lol
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John
