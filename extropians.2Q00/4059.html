<P>Yes, the age old vendetta scenario:
<BR>
``Thou killeth my brother, thus I will kill thee.''
<BR>
<P>Why put down energy on such a rather useless action?
<BR>
<P>Systems (and users, being supersystems) have no control over what packets
<BR>
flow through their networks, which allows bad humans to create naughty programs
<BR>
which send nastygrams which the systems (and its users) would not authorize
<BR>
if they knew about them.
<BR>
<P>Solution: Make them know.
<BR>
<P>Upgrade to a system which defines what packets to allow on the network, which
<BR>
programs communicate with whom usign what kind of packets, and when somebody
<BR>
tries to break or bend these rules raises a Red Alert condition.
<BR>
<P>Then activate the Search and Eliminate Mode to find out where the offending
<BR>
packets came from, and eliminate them at the source. For packets originating
<BR>
from the external world, you can, if you like, instead invoke a simulation
<BR>
to accept the packets, so you can find out who tries to do what, and first
<BR>
then start the Search and Eliminate Mode.
<BR>
<P>Such a system makes much more sense, IMHO, than vendettas, which according to
<BR>
some power mongers may constitute a violation of their ``law''.
