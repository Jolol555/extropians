<P>
a few more points:
<BR>
<P>art can occur anywhere, and everywhere:
<BR>
- engineers usually work according to routines and systematic tools, but often
<BR>
need to be creative (to various degrees) to solve new/unmet problems.
<BR>
- mathematicians/scientists/artists/entrepreneurs/writers can be all art-full
<BR>
but then must use systematic tools to implement/prove their art. mathematicians
<BR>
use proof and logic, scientists use experiments, artists use the canvas or the
<BR>
wheel, entrepreneurs use the business environment, writers use the pen. these
<BR>
are domains of reality.
<BR>
- all people, i believe, can produce art to certain degrees. some people are
<BR>
highly creative and innovative, others are less so: artisans, technicians, etc.
<BR>
whether this is a &quot;nature or nuture&quot; problem is to be debated. i think it is a
<BR>
combination of both.
<BR>
<P>art, science, society, etc: it's all related
<BR>
- consider late 19th century france, and the developments of science and
<BR>
photography, as they influenced the visual arts of the impressionists,
<BR>
expressionists, cubists and other schools of early modernism. the artists
<BR>
experimented with the tools of science (as they always do ... in all domains),
<BR>
to produce new forms of art, to then feed back into science.
<BR>
- consider the art of science fiction, consider how the works of gibson,
<BR>
sterling, vinge, etc all present pictures of the future, through artful 
<BR>
insight.
<BR>
consider then how this feeds back into the creative technologists, who do 
<BR>
create
<BR>
the physical tools from the future, influenced -- whether they know it or 
<BR>
not --
<BR>
by the technological artists. art feeds into science feeds into art feeds into
<BR>
science ...
<BR>
<P>Bleugh ... nudge a rock a little bit, and it rolls ... provide an idea, and 
<BR>
from
<BR>
the mind things unfold ... art.
<BR>
<P>Matthew.
