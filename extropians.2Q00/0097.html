<P><EM>&gt;It has been years since I have received
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a traffic fine, however I have been known to blow a stop sign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at 80 kph, as can be testified by Jeff Davis who was with me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;last time I did so.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so, Spike!
<BR>
<P>First off, let me say without equivocation, that it never happened.  
<BR>
<P>Next, to my knowledge, Spike Jones is an individual of the very highest
<BR>
character, and highly disciplined, who would never intentionally commit an
<BR>
act which was socially irresponsible, such as endangering himself or others
<BR>
by operating a motor vehicle in an unsafe manner.
<BR>
<P>Next, I'm no paragon of virtue, but I have a strong disinclination to
<BR>
ratting on my friends.
<BR>
<P>Next, it is clearly impossible for me, from the passenger's seat, to have
<BR>
been looking towards the left, at the speedometer, so as to be able to
<BR>
verify that the speed was 80 kph (or whatever) and, at the same time, to
<BR>
have been looking forward and to the right so as to witness the passing of
<BR>
the alleged stop sign.  There is a simultaneity problem here.  Even if I
<BR>
had the memory of the experience of the perception of the approach to what,
<BR>
at a distance, exhibited the phenomenal characteristics of stop-sign-ness,
<BR>
the diversion of my attention at the crucial moment would make it
<BR>
impossible for me to say with certainty that we had in fact &quot;passed&quot; it.
<BR>
For instance, if there had been an authentic stop sign there (a point,
<BR>
which among many others, is by no means established), who is to say that
<BR>
some person in authority did not remove it at the very moment when by gaze
<BR>
was averted?  No, in the matter of the reputation of my good friend Spike,
<BR>
I shall be making no unverifiable assumptions.
<BR>
<P>Next, there is the matter of the reliability of my percetions and memory.
<BR>
Heavy drug use during the seventies has left its mark.   Sometimes I can be
<BR>
sitting home in my living room and will seem to see, out of the corner of
<BR>
my eye, stop signs whiz by at 80 kph.  Followed by police sirens.  Are they
<BR>
real stop signs?  Are they real sirens?  Under the circumstances, I'd
<BR>
really feel quite unsettled testifying about real people and real events.
<BR>
<P>Finally, I have no honor, and my integrity is for sale at any time.  For an
<BR>
appropriately substantial package of unmarked bills (bidding starts at five
<BR>
figures, none of which can be smaller than a five), or a candlelight dinner
<BR>
with Cindy Crawford, I will testify to anything.  Nothing I say can be
<BR>
trusted.  You must be mistaken.  I wasn't there.  I didn't see it.  I don't
<BR>
know anything.  I can't remember.  Spike who?
<BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
