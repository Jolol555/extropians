<EM>&gt; Emlyn: First, thank you for your thoughtful comments on the Principles. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found these latest thoughts much more stimulating that your claim that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first principle is &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;modernist&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>It wasn't my intention to say that it was &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;modernist&quot; (although
<BR>
I probably did); I meant to say that it presents as such. Which is probably
<BR>
bad enough.
<BR>
<P>As a reply to your earlier post critiquing my earlier post (arrgh), Anders
<BR>
said all that I would have said, particularly with respect to
<BR>
Modernism/Postmodernism. Actual not all...
<BR>
<P>One point I would add; &quot;Progress&quot; is a term used by Functionalists, esp
<BR>
Evolutionary Functionalist theorists, and was used in context of talking
<BR>
about the world in terms of developed and under-developed nations, including
<BR>
putting all &quot;pre-newtonian&quot; societies in the under-developed nations
<BR>
category. They seem to have an idea that you (a nation) just need a swag of
<BR>
cash and a can-do attitude, and you can become a developed nation; this idea
<BR>
has been shown to be untrue. That's Modernization theory (slightly
<BR>
paraphrased), which I think overlaps with/is Modernism to a high degree.
<BR>
<P>Evolutionary materialists, with whom extropians (even Extropians(tm)) would
<BR>
agree I think, say, rather than the status quo being good because it exists,
<BR>
and all kinds of other functionalist might-makes-right stuff, which is very
<BR>
static stuff, that the world is made up of people/orgs/countries/whatever
<BR>
that have certain levels of power, and they all participate in an elaborate
<BR>
dynamic process where generally those with power tend to hang on to it (and
<BR>
increase it) and do better than those without. The important point made is
<BR>
that the control of resources, and other forms of power, drive social
<BR>
structure, which drives moral/ideological framworks (rather than the other
<BR>
way around).
<BR>
<P>My point about &quot;Progress&quot; is that it's use has been used by
<BR>
Functionalists/Modernists for a long time now to pretend that a process of,
<BR>
for example, rich countries taking stuff from poor countries, and a trend of
<BR>
overall improverishment of the average world citizen, is something positive,
<BR>
a moving forward. A related concept has been something like &quot;unfolding&quot;,
<BR>
that societies &quot;progress&quot; through stages, and that western capitalism is at
<BR>
the pinnacle (or certainly more &quot;advanced&quot;) than any other
<BR>
social/economic/political structure existing thus far. Yet again, it is
<BR>
&quot;might-makes-right&quot;. Why is western-capitalism the best, ideologically (and
<BR>
usually on all axis of measurment)? Because it is winning. Materialism would
<BR>
say that this is a classic case of the power structures determining social
<BR>
structure, which in turn are determining ideology.
<BR>
<P>It is this historical usage of &quot;Progress&quot;, still a very strong memetic
<BR>
association invoked by the word's use, which makes it distasteful to me.
<BR>
When I said linear, what I perhaps meant was an implication of determinism
<BR>
(we are treading the path that fate has laid out before us), and a glossing
<BR>
over of the fact that we don't actually know, often, if &quot;progress&quot; is
<BR>
positive at all.
<BR>
<P>(Hmm, disjointed; my apologies, I've got the flu).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I have a bone to pick about the first principle. I don't think that it
</EM><BR>
adds
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;much that the other principles don't already say, and I think it is
</EM><BR>
overly
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;simplistic about &quot;progress&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sympathetic to what you're saying, though I don't entirely agree. I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been gradually gathering notes for version 4.0 of the Principles, and some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kind of architectural revision is likely. You've certainly spotted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something that I had thought of, even if I don't go along with the idea of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ditching the first principle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; I take the essence of your constructive criticism to be that Principle
</EM><BR>
1
<BR>
<EM>&gt; (Perpetual Improvement) is redundant since it is covered by the principles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Self-Transformation (#2), Intelligent Technology (#4), and Open Society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (#5).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you read the full text of the Principles, rather than the short version
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you quote, I think you will see that Perpetual Improvement has a
</EM><BR>
scope
<BR>
<EM>&gt; not identical to that of those other principles. I think you're insightful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in seeing the overlap. I see Perpetual Improvement as something of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important &quot;metaprinciple&quot;, out of which you can draw some of the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; principles (though not completely without remainder). I would like version
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4.0 to reflect that in some way, though I am not keen on the idea of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hierarchical set of principles where I try to derive everything from one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; master principle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Principles are a group of somewhat fuzzy sets that overlap, but where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some are more central than others. Perhaps the only way to convey this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effectively is through a graphical representation. Alternatively, for
</EM><BR>
those
<BR>
<EM>&gt; interested in the intellectual minutia, I could write an &quot;Explanatory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Comments on the Principle&quot; that explores the relationships between the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; principles. I like the idea of a graphical representation that somehow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shows the links between principles. Once I'm ready, perhaps someone can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help me put this together in a Java applet?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perpetually overcoming constraints on our progress and possibilities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - Why not just &quot;Perpetually overcoming constraints on our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;self-actualisation and self-realization&quot;? Removes that dogmatic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;progressive&quot; tone.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I still don't grok why you think this is dogmatic. Extropian thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly *is* about progress. The terms &quot;self-actualization&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;self-realization&quot; will not do at all. What kind of self is to be realized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or actualized? The self-transformative aspects of Perpetual Progress are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compatible with a huge array of possible ways of self-actualizing, but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with all. Actualizing a self who is excellent at viciously destructive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behavior is not obviously extropic. Nor is actualizing a self who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; epitomizes complete and utter laziness or parasitic reliance on others. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know, I know, you don't *mean* that. But the terms do not exclude those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possibilities. At least &quot;progress&quot; does imply something a bit more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific. Yet the term is sufficiently unspecific and open to personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interpretation that I do not see the sense or justice of calling it
</EM><BR>
&quot;dogmatic&quot;.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Excellent point Max. That's not what I mean, and yet it can of course mean
<BR>
that.
<BR>
<P>This is a difficulty, and something for which I have no good answer this
<BR>
morning. Either you express something about improvement, increase, progress,
<BR>
etc, which has the problems of oversimplification and denying diverse
<BR>
approaches which I have addressed previously. Or, you go down the relativist
<BR>
route; self actualisation, change, transformation, none of which have much
<BR>
of a directional component, or no absolute directional component. So they
<BR>
can mean all kinds of really crappy stuff, because they are relative, and
<BR>
can mean what you want them to mean.
<BR>
<P>Any ideas how you get a clear sense of the idea of improvement, without
<BR>
glossing over the complex, evolutionary (and thus entirely non-linear)
<BR>
approach to that which must be desirable, while still being able to express
<BR>
the whole thing in a few buzzwords?
