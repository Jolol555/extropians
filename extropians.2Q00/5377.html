Foresight Publishes Guidelines for Development of Nanotechnology
<BR>
<P>Palo Alto, California -- June 14, 2000 -- Foresight Institute today
<BR>
announced publication of the first public version of the &quot;Foresight
<BR>
Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology&quot; to assure that research in this
<BR>
rapidly emerging field proceeds safely and responsibly. Based on the
<BR>
report of a February 1999 workshop in Monterey, Calif., sponsored
<BR>
jointly by the Foresight Institute and the Institute for Molecular
<BR>
Manufacturing, publication of the Foresight Guidelines begins an open
<BR>
discussion about the appropriate framework within which to develop
<BR>
nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is predicted to become the basis for
<BR>
remarkably powerful and inexpensive computers, fundamentally new
<BR>
medical technologies that could save millions of lives, and new
<BR>
zero-pollution manufacturing methods that could create greater material
<BR>
abundance for all. Abuse of the technology could also cause considerable
<BR>
damage. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The Foresight Guidelines are a safety framework within which
<BR>
nanotechnology can emerge in the coming decades with minimum risk and
<BR>
maximum benefit,&quot; said Ralph Merkle, Principal Fellow at Zyvex and
<BR>
member of Foresight's Board of Advisors. &quot;Developing nanotechnology
<BR>
within a context of public oversight and discussion in democratic
<BR>
countries is the safest approach. To do this we must continue a vigorous
<BR>
program of research and development. This is essential for an informed
<BR>
public discussion, as well as to pre-empt secret development by
<BR>
undemocratic regimes.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Neil Jacobstein, Chairman of the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing
<BR>
and Crown Fellow at the Aspen Institute said: &quot;The Foresight
<BR>
Guidelines are an important step in the direction of technologists
<BR>
exercising social responsibility long in advance of deploying molecular
<BR>
nanotechnology. We included a brief review of the issues, as well as
<BR>
development principles and some initial guidelines for device design.
<BR>
The Guidelines represent the beginning of a technology policy dialog,
<BR>
which will succeed over time if researchers, policy experts, and the
<BR>
public work together to understand the specific types of nanotechnology,
<BR>
and their associated benefits and risks. We intend to evolve the
<BR>
Foresight Guidelines into a viable strategy for responsible
<BR>
nanotechnology development.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Jim Von Ehr, President and CEO of Zyvex, said: &quot;This is an important
<BR>
document that deserves careful reading by all concerned. As one of the
<BR>
first nanotechnology companies, Zyvex fully supports the Guidelines and
<BR>
is pleased that two of our senior scientists were able to participate
<BR>
in their preparation. I expect that a sense of professional ethics will
<BR>
compel nanotechnology developers to individually subscribe to these
<BR>
principles. These Guidelines are so important that grant-making
<BR>
agencies, even military ones, should require a pledge of adherence as a
<BR>
precondition of funding advanced nanotechnology development.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The basis of the Foresight Guidelines began in analysis and discussions
<BR>
dating back to the late 1970's, when K. Eric Drexler first realized the
<BR>
profound impact that these future technologies could have on the human
<BR>
condition. The full development of nanotechnology is still decades
<BR>
away, providing time for open discussion about what additional
<BR>
guidelines and enforcement mechanisms are appropriate. 
<BR>
<P>Christine Peterson, President of the Foresight Institute, said: &quot;The
<BR>
Internet has changed the world, economically and politically, but
<BR>
compared to what's coming, we ain't seen nothin' yet. The future will be
<BR>
so different from human history that we can barely imagine it -- yet we
<BR>
need to if we're going to make reasonable decisions.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The Institute for Molecular Manufacturing (IMM), www.imm.org, is a Palo
<BR>
Alto based nonprofit foundation formed in 1991 to carry out research
<BR>
aimed at developing molecular nanotechnology. IMM sponsored the writing
<BR>
of the first technical book on nanotechnology, Nanosystems: Molecular
<BR>
Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation (Wiley Interscience, 1992),
<BR>
and the first technical book on medical nanotechnology, Nanomedicine
<BR>
(Landes Bioscience, 1999). It also supports the development of the
<BR>
Foresight Guidelines, and other ongoing nanotechnology research. 
<BR>
<P>The Foresight Institute, www.foresight.org, is a Palo Alto based
<BR>
nonprofit educational organization founded in 1986 in response to the
<BR>
book, Engines of Creation, in which Drexler said &quot;the approaching
<BR>
breakthroughs [in nanotechnology] will become steadily more obvious.
<BR>
They will eventually seize public attention. Our chances will be better
<BR>
if, when that time comes, a sound set of ideas has been hammered out
<BR>
and has begun to spread...&quot; The organization's series of Foresight
<BR>
Conferences on Molecular Nanotechnology is the oldest and most widely
<BR>
respected in its field. The Foresight Update is a newsletter on
<BR>
technical, social and other developments in nanotechnology. Foresight
<BR>
sponsors the prestigious annual Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology, named
<BR>
after the Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman. The Foresight
<BR>
Guidelines are available on the web at:
