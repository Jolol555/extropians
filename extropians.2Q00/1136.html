<EM>&gt; Maybe you can look at welfare this way:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Givens:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - There is always going to be a segment of the population which is &quot;dead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weight&quot;, ie not able to support itself. This seems a fairly reasonable
</EM><BR>
given
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to me, but if you don't agree, speak up!
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but with two very important caveats:
<BR>
<P>1) In the past, or in the third world today, there may be a significant
<BR>
number of relatively functional people who are unable to find work. In
<BR>
modern-day America this is not the case - even the most unskilled laborer
<BR>
can easily find work at a convenience store, fast food joint or other
<BR>
low-wage venue if he or she chooses to do so. The only adults who are ever
<BR>
going to be genuinely unable to find work are those who are so mentally
<BR>
impaired as to be unable to function in normal society, those who are too
<BR>
ill to be physically capable of doing light manual labor, and those who have
<BR>
such a long criminal history that they are unable to persuade anyone to hire
<BR>
them. These groups need to be considered, but they are far smaller than the
<BR>
class of people who are usually considered &quot;dead weight&quot;.
<BR>
<P>2) The fraction of the population that is self-supporting is not fixed, but
<BR>
rather it is inversely proportional to the amount of welfare a society
<BR>
offers. There is always a small group of people who sit on the dividing line
<BR>
between &quot;self supporting&quot; and &quot;dead weight&quot;, and any form of government
<BR>
social assistance, no matter how modest or how narrowly targeted, will tip
<BR>
some of them over into the &quot;dead weight&quot; side of the scales. This is how the
<BR>
vicious cycle of welfare creating poverty which begets more welfare gets its
<BR>
start.
<BR>
<P>I would suggest that any government welfare program is going to run afoul of
<BR>
#2, and the way the political process works ensures that it will quickly end
<BR>
up having a net negative effect. You might be able to get away with
<BR>
government-run insane asylums and orphanages, but those are about the only
<BR>
places where the dividing line between the needy and the moochers seem sharp
<BR>
enough to survive protracted lobbying by special interests.
<BR>
<P>OTOH, the fraction of the population that would not be covered by those two
<BR>
measures, and is not in trouble due to habitual criminal behavior, should be
<BR>
extremely small. Add in the fact that most of them would only be facing
<BR>
temporary problems (due to illness), and it seems reasonable to expect that
<BR>
private charity would be sufficient to help them. If you really want a
<BR>
government program to be involved, I'd suggest you look at special tax
<BR>
breaks rather than direct funding.
