<P>&quot;Your ideas on 'What really matters?' are very biased...  Who are you to

tell people that 'improving' the universe is what really matters?&quot;

<P>&quot;I've never read a more brilliant piece in my life.  I knew there was
<BR>
something up with the human race.  I've been asking The Question since
<BR>
grade 6, and I had an idea what the answer is.  This incredible piece I
<BR>
just read... puts it much more clearly.&quot;

<BR>
<P>&quot;As one might suspect, the &quot;answer&quot; to which this site directs the
<BR>
questioner is a rather insipid one, a &quot;Meaning of Life FAQ&quot; laced with
<BR>
tired Extropian tropes. It suggests that people exist only to build more
<BR>
intelligent machines, and to persuade these machines to embrace a
<BR>
similar dogma. There's something quite sinister in AltaVista proffering
<BR>
this as an answer to an online query, as if the search engine itself was
<BR>
on its way to becoming William Gibson's nightmarish AI, Wintermute.&quot;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But now I felt that Jeeves was ready for the grand daddy of all
<BR>
questions. What is the meaning of life? Could he do it? Jeeves had been
<BR>
quite accurate thus far but this is a question that has troubled man
<BR>
since the beginning of time. My fellow readers, the result brought a
<BR>
tear to my eye.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was directed to a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) entitled FAQ
<BR>
about the meaning of life. There it was! The meaning of life broken down
<BR>
into topics and subtopics so as to be easily understood by all. For
<BR>
centuries man has grappled with this question and it turns out that it
<BR>
can be easily broken down into a short, well organized document. Finding
<BR>
this of course will only lead to a new question for mankind. What Now?&quot;
