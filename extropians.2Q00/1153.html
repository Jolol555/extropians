What I am primarily interested in, Anders, is not merely, the general the 
<BR>
expansion and acceptance of  TransHumanist and Extropian views, however 
<BR>
enjoyable that is! What I m the focusing on the obscure and strange notion of 
<BR>
'resurrection' that can be outlined in a pure, materialist, physicalist, 
<BR>
objectivist, hypothesis. Now basically, Moravec, Tipler, and Tegmark have 
<BR>
done some essays on this; and have published; hence the attention that they 
<BR>
have received.
<BR>
<P>I am concerned with that amongst our August group (or anywhere else) there 
<BR>
appears to be a dearth of such intellectual creativity on this admittedly, 
<BR>
unusual, topic. Moreover, I believe that this line of study would make 
<BR>
in-roads with the general public. I mean, if you have at least pointed the 
<BR>
way out of permanent death, then nonotech and macro-engineering would be much 
<BR>
easier to gather support for.
<BR>

<P>&lt;&lt; Do you want papers loudly proclaiming transhumanism or *doing*
<BR>
&nbsp;transhumanism? Over the last years a lot of the science journals have
<BR>
&nbsp;becuome much more transhumanism-friendly, Nature runs a series of
<BR>
&nbsp;science fiction &quot;essays&quot; of which many are transhumanist or deal with
<BR>
&nbsp;transhumanist issues, there was a debate essay in Science about the
<BR>
&nbsp;effects of radical life extension - and of course reading Nature,
<BR>
&nbsp;Science or PNAS these days almost feels like a Greg Egan story.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;The important things are done by the creeping acceptance of
<BR>
&nbsp;transhumanist visions and memes in the mainstream. The loud Moravecs,
<BR>
&nbsp;Tiplers and Kurtzweils are good for attracting attention to themselves
<BR>
&nbsp;and bring the questions into the open, but unless there is a good base
<BR>
&nbsp;of transhumanesque ideas widely spread nothing will come of it.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;As for myself, my research is moving in the direction of modelling
<BR>
&nbsp;cognitive enhancements. &gt;&gt;
