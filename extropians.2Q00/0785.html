<EM>&gt;From: Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lee@piclab.com?Subject=Re:%20Re[2]:%20POL:%20Reaction%20to%20Microsoft%20Ruling&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000415052621.23449.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">lee@piclab.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt; It's not really a &quot;monopoly.&quot;  The ABA does not have the exclusive right 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; practice law.  The ABA in fact does not practice law.  It is merely a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; professional association of unrelated individuals who are licensed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; practice law.  It just so happens that the practice of law requires a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; license in every state in the union.  But that does not mean that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lawyers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are exercising a monopoly any more than contractors, engineers, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;architects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or physicians or any other profession which you need a license in order 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; legally practice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Saying that lawyers have a &quot;monopoly&quot; on the practice of law is like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that licensed drivers have a monopoly on driving.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's much worse than that, though: a license to practive law requires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the holder to do far more than merely demonstrated competence.  One must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;swear and oath to become an &quot;officer of the court&quot;--so even if you intend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to practice law only to sue the government, you have to swear loyalty to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your opponent--and most places _require_ you to join the &quot;private&quot; BA,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and abide by its regulations (which does indeed make it a government-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;backed monopoly).  A defendant, who supposedly has a right to counsel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for his defense, does not have the right to hire counsel that has not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thus sworm loyalty to the court and to a private organization with its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;own warped sense of ethics (ethics, to the bar association, means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;making sure the right pockets get lined).
</EM><BR>
<P>Not quite.  I don't know of any state which requires lawyers to swear 
<BR>
loyalty to the government or even to the courts.  In my state (California) 
<BR>
lawyers merely take an oath to (1) uphold the Constitution and (2) 
<BR>
faithfully execute the duties of a lawyer.  In fact it would be an ethical 
<BR>
violation to swear loyalty to any organization (even the government) since, 
<BR>
as you suggest, your client might end up suing that entity.  There is 
<BR>
nothing wrong with swearing loyalty to the Constitution, because (obviously) 
<BR>
you can't sue the Constitution.
<BR>
<P>Further, the state and national bar associations are no more 
<BR>
&quot;government-backed&quot; than any other professional association.  The BA has no 
<BR>
rights or powers other than the oversight of the members of the profession.  
<BR>
In this respect it is no different than, say, state medical boards.
<BR>
