<EM>&gt;I couldn't access this, but I found a 1990 essay on his web site at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/pdf_files/Bull_and_Bear.pdf">http://econ161.berkeley.edu/pdf_files/Bull_and_Bear.pdf</A>.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However upon closer study, I noticed some things which made me more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;skeptical.  His model often lags the actual stock price movements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is especially noticeable in the 1929 crash.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But actually you can argue that the drop in dividends in 1930 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;onward was caused in part by the stock market crash. ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It seems, therefore, that the stock market crash led to dividend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reductions, which then caused his model to predict a stock market crash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But that's not a good prediction because the causative condition only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;occured after the supposed effect.
</EM><BR>
<P>The paper I cited (which I just emailed to you) has some statistical
<BR>
tests that should not have this problem.
<BR>
<P>Another interpretation of the lag is that stocks embody information
<BR>
about future dividends that are not embodied in this history of
<BR>
past dividends.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Also, whenever I read these kinds of papers I want to see whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;analysis works when extrapolated forward.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I doubt that it would predict the degree of increase the market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has actually seen, with P/E ratios much higher than historical averages.
</EM><BR>
<P>My doubt isn't as strong as yours, but yes it would be interested to see.
