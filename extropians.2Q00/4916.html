<P><EM>&gt; Regarding the original proposal in this thread to have a web-enabled popular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legislative process, I have misgivings on two fronts:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.  &quot;There Ought to be a Law&quot;.  Do we really want to make it easier to pass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new laws more quickly in response to &quot;popular&quot; concerns?  In many instances
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it takes time to see the full outlines of a matter of current broad public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concern.  I'd be afraid of a process like this making legislation a simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reflection of fads and momentary preoccupations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.  Scale.  Especially if such a system were implemented on a national level,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd be very concerned that national majorities would ignore local minority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realities.  Until we get more balance restored in our federal system here in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the US (which has more checks on federal centralized power than most large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diverse nations already), I think we could have the people who live in big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cities in New York, California and Texas dictating the conditions of life in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Montana, New Mexico and Missouri more than they already do.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let's not forget the context of Richard's famous comment: His plan to &quot;first,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kill all the lawyers&quot; was part of his program to impose a personal

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         &quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                                           -- Desmond Morris
</EM><BR>
<P>Like most, I think the Constitution and its Bill of Rights are each vital
<BR>
protections of our freedoms.  It is certain that without either that this
<BR>
particular country would have had a much harder time being as free as it is,
<BR>
although how free it is is an open question.
<BR>
<P>In terms of web-enabled popular legislative process, one issue is that for now
<BR>
Internet access is still not equitable across ethnographic, geographic,and
<BR>
economic differences.
<BR>
<P>In recent primary elections, Arizona voters were allowed to vote over the
<BR>
Internet.  This is illustrative of the first advance in technology-aided
<BR>
democracy, where voters may use empowering mechanisms enabled by advances in
<BR>
technology.  Arizona also happens to have a unique drug policy, which I see as a
<BR>
sign of advancement.
<BR>
<P>There are several resources about electronic voting, one of the first I remember
<BR>
seeing was from this group:  <A HREF="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/voting/voting.html">http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/voting/voting.html</A>.
<BR>
I am interested to see more information along these lines.
<BR>
<P>You have a valid point in that the &quot;tyranny of 51%&quot; is an issue, and one where if
<BR>
the law changed every day depending upon the current whim of the current voters,
<BR>
the law would be a much more mutable beast than it is today.
<BR>
<P>By the same token, it is vital that the people be able to advance their ideas of
<BR>
what should be legislation to the floors of the legislature, as even one small
<BR>
method to fight against the &quot;tyranny of the less than %1&quot;.
<BR>
<P>So, if a virtual community is organized to where it could accept citizen
<BR>
signatures for various causes they would support in the various locales, as well
<BR>
to register them to vote electronically if they would be so registered, so that
<BR>
these petition processes are fulfilled in a completely public manner in
<BR>
conjunction with traditional street-based grassroots organization, then the
<BR>
legislature as it is can be presented with legislature that represents the will
<BR>
of the people that they must then address.
<BR>
<P>If a locale does not have petition process to introduce legislation or the
<BR>
petition process is unfair to the petitioner's, then this should be changed so
<BR>
that the elected officials must address in the course of their lawmaking what the
<BR>
people as opposed to only what laws are proposed by other legislators.
<BR>
<P>Also, any citizen concerned about any legislation should be able to send their
<BR>
testimony upon any legislation to the deciding group and to have it entered into
<BR>
the public record.  Also, any citizen should be able to register their vote on
<BR>
any voted issue, whether or not it is immediately counted.
<BR>
<P>I don't suggest abandoning the government based upon the rules of the
<BR>
Constitution, far from it.  There are some issues with basically a two party
<BR>
system where when any third or fourth or fifth party garners a significant
<BR>
percentage of the vote they have no representation.  What I am suggesting is to
<BR>
make it easier for the citizens to vote their opinion on any issue that they
<BR>
would, and for any significant group of citizens to see their proposed
<BR>
legislature introduced, for consideration and the public record.
