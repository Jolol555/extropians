<EM>&gt;&gt; In this light, it makes absolutely no sense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; whatsoever to give *any* money to provide a &quot;safety net&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; for the needy: you're simply diverting resources that could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; have a far greater impact, given time.  When we emphasise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the public sector we do so out of a romanticized sense of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; what good should be - pure, direct, and heartfelt - rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; than a rational sense of how good is achieved.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmmm...what if that needy kid who died at the age of nine from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complications associated with staph infection would have turned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out to be the inventor of some crucial technology without which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the future is grim rather than happy?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, then, we might have made the wrong choice in retrospect given our
<BR>
goals--but so what?  Should we then abandon making those choices given
<BR>
the information we have, just because we might be wrong?  Besides which
<BR>
the conditions you postulate are unlikely: if we make a decision about
<BR>
law/culture/society that on the whole saves lives while costing a few
<BR>
others, whatever benefit to society those lost lives may have contributed
<BR>
will likely be contributed by those we saved, maybe in a different way or
<BR>
at different times.  The romantic notion that discoveries are made by
<BR>
heroic individuals out of thin air is pure Hollywood--inventions are made
<BR>
by whoever is in the right place at the right time to make connections
<BR>
between, generalizations of, and extrapolations from the common knowledge
<BR>
of the time.
<BR>
<P>And of course all of that is predicated on the utilitarian premise
<BR>
that making more people happy is the appropriate goal, while I as an
<BR>
egoist see that as a mere side effect of my own goals, or perhaps
<BR>
one means to acheiving my own goals.
<BR>
<P>The old &quot;if just one life...&quot; arguments are tiresome and pointless.
<BR>
There exists no choice without both costs and benefits to be weighed,
<BR>
and there is no excuse to make irrational choices, ever.
<BR>
