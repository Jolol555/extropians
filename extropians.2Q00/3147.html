<P><EM>&gt;&quot;I Love You&quot; and the Problem of Cyberwarfare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Summary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Last week, officials from the government and the computer industry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gathered in the wake of the massive denial of service attacks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;against commercial web sites and the outbreak of the &quot;I Love You&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;virus. The real problem the United States and much of the world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;faces is that people are overwhelmingly dependent upon a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computer operating system that is exceedingly vulnerable to even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;simple attacks. The PC and the Internet have become indispensable -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;while remaining indefensible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Analysis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Last week, U.S. government and computer industry officials gathered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in California for a summit on computer security. The meeting took
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;place in the wake of a recent spate of computer viruses and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attacks, including the massive denial of a service attack,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;apparently launched by a Canadian teenager, and the &quot;I Love You&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;virus, seemingly launched by someone in the Philippines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It is important to realize that neither of these attacks were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;developed by computer geniuses. The Canadian teenager's ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shut down Amazon.com was perhaps one notch more sophisticated than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;setting an autodialier on a telephone to repeatedly call someone's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;phone, making it impossible for real callers to get through. The &quot;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Love You&quot; virus was a simple macro written in a fairly simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;language, Visual Basic, that took advantage of the lack of security
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on Microsoft's e-mail package. No one is going to be offering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;either of these software creators jobs at the National Security
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Agency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Some people are taking comfort in this. John Dvorak, a usually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;astute observer of the computing world, wrote in PC Week, &quot;The Love
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bug Virus is the type of thing that's great for keeping journalists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;busy on a slow news day. I've never seen anything get so much ink.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The question of the day: Will writing two-bit destructive viruses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;become the way that loners and goofballs get their 15 minutes of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fame? I suspect this is the case. It certainly beats setting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;oneself up on the school clock tower and picking off fellow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;classmates with a rifle.&quot;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Dvorak is of course right - but he's missing his own point. Vitally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;important news is being made. The news is this: It is now possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for a comparatively unsophisticated computer programmer to create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;absolute havoc. It is not the hacker's psychological profile that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is interesting; it is the intellectual profile that is stunning. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;used to be possible for a brilliant but unstable person to wreak
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;havoc. Today, a not particularly bright crackpot can achieve the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same outcome. And that is the point. There are few brilliant people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the world. There are lots of dullards. Based on the ratio of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fools to geniuses, the likelihood of future attacks increases.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem is this: the personal computer and the Internet are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;both revolutionary - and yet, terrifically vulnerable. Both are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;less than a generation old and comparatively primitive, like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;telephone or automobile early on in their evolution. Yet the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;revolutionary nature of computing today allows all kinds of people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to do important things in ways once impossible. Everyday people in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all walks of life and work have become dependent on these systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The vulnerability of these systems stems from the simple fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they were never intended to be the center of such dependency. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personal computer was developed as a stand-alone system. Unlike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mainframes with multiple users using multiple accounts, the PC was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deliberately designed to serve the needs of an individual. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;entire purpose of the PC was to be a functioning system that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;provided the user unfettered access to his data, programs and even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;operating system. Hence its name. It followed from this that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individual was unlikely to seek to harm his own computer or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;data on it. Security was hardly a priority.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Connectivity between PCs has crept in slowly. Not so long ago,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people couldn't conceive of a mass market for PCs. As word
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processors and spreadsheets emerged, the usefulness of the PC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;became more apparent. Still, few people in the 1980s imagined that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one of the PC's primary roles would be that of a communications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;device. At first limited to a handful of military and academic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;users, e-mail usage began to explode in the late 1980s.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Early e-mail had been built around a few academic mainframes. A PC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;user would get a campus account - either on a mainframe or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;minicomputer - in terminal mode, not as a true computer. He would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dial up to that account via a modem, at 300 or 1200 baud. That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computer would link to other computers in a crazy quilt pattern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;called Bitnet, which had spun off from ARPAnet (a Defense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Department initiative). Over time, data files were stored on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;various university mainframes. One of the biggest was at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;University of Minnesota, with tons of non-graphical information.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Using this network of computers, the user could hop around the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;world. Out of this primitive connectivity, came the explosion of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the World Wide Web.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But the PC was never intended for this purpose - it was created for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a single user. Efficient usage meant that much of the function of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the operating system was hidden from the user, who really didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;need to know what was going on within the system. Also, in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interest of ease of use, the different applications became more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tightly integrated with each other and within the file system. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;outcome, of course, was the Microsoft-driven computer of today
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where the word processor, spread sheet, e-mail package, web browser
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and file system are intimately connected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As a result, it is difficult today to figure out exactly what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;going on inside your own computer. The integration of processes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;obfuscates the operating system. A good example can be found in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;famous &quot;blue screen of death&quot; that functions like a &quot;service
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;engine&quot; light. It tells you that you are in trouble, but doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tell you why. The inability of the Microsoft Operating System (OS)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to tell the user what is wrong is a feature, not a bug, as they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;say. The OS frequently doesn't have any idea what has failed. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complexity of the system itself makes transparency impossible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Microsoft triumphed because it provided for the easy exchange of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;files within the PC and between PCs. But that very ease of exchange
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;created the current potential crisis. The Microsoft operating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;system took advantage of connectivity opportunities. Once the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computer became connected, it was no longer under the sole control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the owner, whose interest was in protecting his computer and his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;data; instead the owner is now exchanging information with others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who might have more malicious interests. The structure of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Microsoft OS made it extremely difficult to deal with maliciousness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for two reasons:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1. The increasingly tight integration of the OS with applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and links between applications means that malicious imported code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can migrate rapidly from one part of the system to another. The &quot;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Love You&quot; virus, for example, attacked the address book of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;email system, as well as attacking music and graphics files.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;2. The lack of transparency of the operating system makes it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extremely difficult to create programs that can see what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;happening inside of the computer in real time, creating shut-offs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or fail-safes. Current anti-virus software is forced to identify
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;known viruses by scanning incoming files. This means that new,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unknown viruses can't be stopped.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;During the denial of service attacks on web sites, no one could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;figure out where attacks came from because a single attacker can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;route attacks through thousands of computers. It is possible to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plant malicious code on a computer whose mission is not to attack
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the host computer - but to propagate itself to other computers and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then to begin simply linking to Internet sites, shutting them down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by sheer overload. Finding these tiny bits of malicious code on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;server is mind-numbingly difficult. It can be anywhere in the file
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;system and called virtually anything. There is some software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;designed to detect this code. But it needs to be installed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who are concerned with damage to other servers - altruism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that is fairly rare.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A teenage kid can knock out hundreds of corporate systems because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the foundation of modern computing, the operating system, has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in rapid, forced development since the success of MS-DOS. It was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;designed for one user who would treat it right. The hyper-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;connectivity of the Internet exposes it to code delivered by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;others. The Windows operating system was simply not built with this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in mind. It has served brilliantly as a tool for exchanging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But its very success has created the menace. The neat macros
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;created in a spreadsheet can be made malicious by a teenage kid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Interoperability and interconnectivity were created without regard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to security. And there can be none without transparency. You can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be secure if there is no method for knowing what is happening in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your operating system. It is the perfect environment in which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;viruses can flourish. That is true on the client and the server.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem is that we are dependent on these systems for our daily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work and our daily work can be used to spread harmful programs. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a teenager can wreak this havoc, imagine what a concerted effort by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a well-funded government intelligence agency can do. That, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;course, is the point. Dependency on the computer and the Internet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at this primitive stage of development opens us to attack,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;particularly from societies that are not dependent on PCs and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;internet, but that do possess the intellectual skills needed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mount the attack.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;One executive of an anti-virus company has suggested that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should never open a file from someone you don't know. That is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;measure of how shallow our defenses are. How can you be sure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the person you know hasn't become infected? In fact, how can you be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sure that the person you know doesn't want to zap you? Some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;companies have solved the problem by prohibiting attachments and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;removing floppy drives. In other words, they have solved the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problem by losing the capability. The solution is not in policies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but in technology. The problem's center of gravity is the operating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Security requires a complete re-engineering of the operating system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to permit rapid diagnosis through complete transparency. It will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not be easy to evolve Windows or NT in this direction. It seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that officials may want to deal with this problem. After all, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;real threat from rogue states won't be nuclear attack, but cyber
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attack. Rogue states won't launch nuclear attack for fear of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;counterattack. But how do we retaliate against a virus attack? We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;depend on computers. They don't.
