<EM>&gt; &gt; What the heck -- I've been pondering this for a while, so I'll throw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the question out:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What do you think of the possibility of delivery of nukes in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; container ship?  This is my main scenario to fear: some North Korean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (or other potentially hostile nation) agents bribe dockworkers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; somewhere close to home (South Korea in this case, though I guess this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; just got a heck of lot less likely in the last few days) to allow them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to insert just one &quot;special&quot; carton among the thousands and thousands
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of cartons in a container aboard a cargo ship, set to detonate via GPS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; trigger upon arrival at the correct latitude and longitude.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dockworkers might just assume it's a contraband shipment, not a weapon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of mass destruction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem with the scenario is that since we know the container ship came from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a North Korean port, that it was North Korean agents who did it, so NK would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be likely to exist as a livable region for more than a week after that. That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would not be in the best interest of the North Korean government.
</EM><BR>
<P>Um, my example was specifically the ship coming from South Korea.  The
<BR>
idea being that somebody moves the weapon along the first leg of the
<BR>
trip (North Korea -&gt; South Korea) some other way.  But anyway, let's
<BR>
assume instead that it's some other portion of the world.  You'd be
<BR>
hard pressed to know that the weapon was detonated by the country the
<BR>
ship originated in.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; In the mideast, this scenario could play out as a nuke stashed in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; oil tanker, possibly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I have heard (though never got confirmation, anybody know for sure?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Care to tell me I'm wrong and quit worrying?)  that the vast majority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of cargo arriving in U.S. ports never goes through any kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; inspection, and if it does it's usually a random inspection of a small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; portion of the contents, making it extremely unlikely that one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; particular suspicious carton among the Hyundai's or whatever would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; noticed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, all imported stuff is held in bond at the port, and they have drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dogs sniffing stuff out, as that is the most prevalent thing, though they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dogs trained to sniff for other stuff. Vehicles get weighed, as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; containers, and weights must match the bill of lading the receiving customer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has.
</EM><BR>
<P>But not every individual box containing stuff inside a container gets
<BR>
opened and inspected, right?  Also, if it's a GPS-controlled  weapon,
<BR>
it could detonate as the ship is coming into harbor.  Inspection is
<BR>
too late, unless it happens far from shore.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Of course, this gets even easier if it's a bioweapon.  Essentially,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm much more worried about trojan horses more than sophisticated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ICBM's or other weapons systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a bioweapons would be much easier to sneak in, for sure.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would think nearly unpreventable.
<BR>

<BR>
