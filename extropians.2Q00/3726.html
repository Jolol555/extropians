<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Forget where I saw this SF plot idea: Some people are discovered not to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-aware.  Of course, they act just like normal people, but in reality are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just &quot;zombies&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe it was my text &quot;The Zombie Era&quot; I posted a few weeks back? 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Exactly what is self-awareness anyway?
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe the awareness of our own existence as a subsystem of the world?
<BR>
Note that self-awareness is something different from consciousness
<BR>
(which it is often mixed up with; the term consciousness is often used
<BR>
to refer to a lot of things). Also, my story did not deal with people
<BR>
lacking self-awareness, they lacked conscious experience but could
<BR>
still talk convincingly about their internal states (which they did
<BR>
not feel).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How close are we to the border between automatons and higher beings?
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would self-awareness be the distinguishing line? I can imagine
<BR>
both self-aware automatons and higher beings without self-awareness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps we all slip into and out of self-awareness, but the self-awareness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself bridges the gaps to maintain the illusion of continuity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just look at dreaming and sleep for example. Also, in flow states
<BR>
people are in general not aware of themselves, they are too busy to
<BR>
divert their attention to watch themselves. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps this is why modifying our own behaviors and attitudes is often so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult: our self-models are too incomplete, and/or our self-awareness is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too time-disjointed, to allow us to be very effective at altering ourselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>A good point. I don't know if disjointed self-awareness is bad for
<BR>
self-modification (sometimes, such as in training martial arts it is
<BR>
bad for the performance), but clearly our incomplete self-models make
<BR>
us use less than optimal tools or try to solve the wrong problems. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I continue to marvel at Greg Egan's masterful novel, _Diaspora_:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - 6-dimensional universe, vividly described!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - The Introdus (uploading) and its profound implications.
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be interesting to write a book set during the Introdus,
<BR>
looking at the social changes caused by it and the philosophical
<BR>
issues brought up by it. In Diaspora everybody is so used to being
<BR>
software that nobody takes notice, in Permutation City mainly the
<BR>
Copies brood over their metaphysical nature. During the Introdus just
<BR>
about everybody would have to be confronted with these issues. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Delurking,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Chris
</EM><BR>
<P>Welcome!
