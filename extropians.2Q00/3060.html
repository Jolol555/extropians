<P><EM>&gt; Robert, this assumes that hotspots are in line of sight, that we have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough gear to watch the whole of the surface, and that behaviour of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agents is unmoderated aggressive.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are a whole host of problems that have to be solved for
<BR>
bioecophagy.  I suggested a number of clever work-arounds to
<BR>
Robert, some of which were addressed, some of which may not
<BR>
have been.  The real *fine* point comes down to the discussion
<BR>
of whether the machines evolve naturally or are consciously
<BR>
designed to evade detection.
<BR>
<P>The natural biosphere is unmoderated aggressive, so I don't
<BR>
view the &quot;natural nanobots&quot; scenario as much different from our
<BR>
current reality except that it can disassemble the biosphere to
<BR>
create a nanosphere but is constrained on a number of fronts.
<BR>
How for example does a CHON (diamondoid) nanobot &quot;grow&quot; in the
<BR>
desert or arctic?
<BR>
<P>If you are talking a multi-material (C -- Al2O3 -- SiO2) nanochemistry
<BR>
then I think you are talking something created and not something
<BR>
accidentally evolved.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Given that behaviour will be at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least initially set to stealth and dispersal, before the midgame
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behaviour will be expressed, these are not safe assumptions.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are talking consciously designed evil-bots here, so you have
<BR>
to assume (a) defense technology ~= offense technology; or (b)
<BR>
a huge disparity (which requires conventional weapons responses).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You have to be there in person, i.e. have the whole landscape covered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a distributed diagnostic and rapid response mesh, with sensors,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence, caches, rapid trasport and deployment as well as mop-up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; procedure. This is not trivial infrastructure.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, as I pointed out to Eliezer, you can simply raise the environmental
<BR>
temperature to a level sufficient to exterminate the vermin.
<BR>
As a last resort, nuclear weapons do this quite effectively.
<BR>
Robert, I believe, points out that the thermal conductivity
<BR>
of air is pretty poor, so if you can identify infected regions
<BR>
you simply incinerate them.  What you need to balance this and
<BR>
make it an effective strategy is the construction of current-tech 
<BR>
enclaves that are not easily breeched.  Cheyenne Mountain
<BR>
(www.spacecom.af.mil) comes to mind.
<BR>
<P>You propose an extreme situation -- the release of consciously
<BR>
designed destructive nanobots -- you cannot expect the response
<BR>
to be &quot;polite&quot;.  This is a &quot;take no prisoners&quot; war.  The first
<BR>
time you encounter one (like an nasty agricultural pest) the
<BR>
response should be overwhelming and as effective as possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Its presence will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; create artifacts, which is not desirable for a countermeasure. It will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take it sweet time to be developed, deployed, and debugged.
</EM><BR>
<P>No argument, a &quot;surgical&quot; defense, however desirable may not
<BR>
be available.  Best hope you are not living in locations where
<BR>
the non-surgical defenses are required.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Immune system is flesh policing flesh. Here we have dry solid-state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; devices policing themselves and vulnerable ecosystems. Imo, this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not comparable.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps.  The badbots (in an engineered scenario) know that the
<BR>
goodbots must eliminate them at all costs.  They must either be
<BR>
very quick or very stealthy.  The badbots might have a &quot;enter&quot; and
<BR>
change the genetic program of the host, and disintegrate protocol.
<BR>
But that would have to survive organismal state monitoring and
<BR>
correction by your self-bots.   If the self-bots are programmed
<BR>
to maintain homeostasis then their capabilities over and above
<BR>
normal physiology should keep things from out of hand.  The
<BR>
only effective strategy I can see is to sabotage the self-bots
<BR>
and that would require penetration of security protoocols.
<BR>
<P>If you have sloppy security protocols, then you probably
<BR>
get what you deserve.
<BR>
