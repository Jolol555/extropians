<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've got quite a lot more ideas on this going round - but I'd quite like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;to hear everyone's opinions on what I've said so far.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm impressed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's a *lot* more to come. I'm trying to get this together into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; workable RPG, so I'm going to have to cover every inch of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; background.
</EM><BR>
<P>What about the cartoons and novellas at the Matrix site? Some seem to
<BR>
have rather interesting alternate takes on things.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If I had read your post before seeing the movie it would have made suspension
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of disbelief much easier and I'd have enjoyed the movie that much more.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; particularly like your take that the AI's are following Asimov's laws and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doing what they think we want them to.  I just could not buy into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; human-Duracel bit.  I can't see how we'd make more efficient batteries than,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; say, solar energy or even an army of cloned electric eels.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No way at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Personally, I think there were two major ickynesses to the film -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Morpheus' explanation of the AIs, and the existence of the Oracle.
</EM><BR>
<P>That Morpheus was making things up in order to sound more impressive
<BR>
is rather believable - after you have impressed the newbie, you don't
<BR>
like to admit you haven't got all the answers.
<BR>
<P>As for the oracle, I can see two explanations. One is simply that she
<BR>
was a representative/representation of some other, very powerful
<BR>
system with its own agenda. The other explanation would be that time
<BR>
in the Matrix does not correspond 1-to-1 with outside time but is
<BR>
calculated in another order, like Moravec's treatment of HashLife in
<BR>
Mind Children (this is too hard to handle in a film or rpg, but my
<BR>
favorite explanation). She was merely telling about already
<BR>
pre-calculated scenes.
