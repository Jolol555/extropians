<EM>&gt; It is obvious that one can imagine lots of examples in which being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; courteous would maximize the speaker's self interests,...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; More generally, I think I can make the stronger case that this doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just happen in rare instances.  By and large, WHENEVER you're trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; convince someone that something is true, *whenever* you make a statement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the simple indicative mood, you're almost certain to be more convincing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a person if you don't call them an idiot...
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree--there are certainly times when courtesy is in one's interest,
<BR>
and I am capable of it at those times.  I suppose the &quot;disease&quot; is not
<BR>
so much courtesy itself as the _expectation_ of it in others.  That's
<BR>
where the real problems come from.
<BR>
<P>There is also the unstated assumption in your statement there that
<BR>
the purpose of communicating an idea is to convince the person you're
<BR>
talking to that the idea has merit.  In person, that's usually the
<BR>
case.  In person, there's also the survival value previously mentioned
<BR>
that lack of courtesy can get your nose broken.  That's why I'm a
<BR>
generally quiet fellow in person.  But neither of those arguments
<BR>
holds up to mailing list discussion: I am in no danger of a bloody
<BR>
nose, and the person I'm replying to is an insignificant part of the
<BR>
audience of each message.
