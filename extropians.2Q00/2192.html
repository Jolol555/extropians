<EM>&gt; &gt; The thing you have to remember about a VR is that it isn't an alternate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; universe. Any transformation that happens in the virtual world has to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; implemented as an actual transformation on real particles in a physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; system. It doesn't have to be the *same* transformation, but it has to
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *some* transformation of equal or greater information content. No matter
</EM><BR>
how
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cleverly you design the VR, it will always have this constraint due to
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; simple fact that the virtual world has no independent existence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So you are in the VR, and you have built a computer which holds a 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or a 0, and you want to erase it.  Obviously there is no need for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; VR to simulate anything becoming hotter.  It can simulate any laws of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physics it wants to, and it need not be constrained by the usual laws
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of thermodynamics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However in the physical world if the VR erasure is mirrored by a physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; erasure, that must dissipate heat.  The amount dissipated need not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any particular bearing on the amount that the VR person would calculate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no &quot;if&quot; about it. In order to erase a virtual bit in the VR, there
<BR>
must be *at least* one real bit being erased in the real world (in fact,
<BR>
unless you are extremely clever about how you encode the VR's data there
<BR>
will be lots and lots of real bits for every &quot;virtual&quot; bit). So, the VR
<BR>
person might not be able to see the energy dissipation, but it still happens
<BR>
and it still represents a limit on the amount of computation the VR person
<BR>
can do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For one thing, the amount of heat dissipated per erasure depends on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; temperature.  The simulated temperature in the VR doesn't have anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do with the temperature of the physical system.  The VR may appear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be erasing a bit in a room temperature computer while the physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer running the VR is cryogenically cooled.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but that has no effect on the amount of computation the system can do.
<BR>
The constraint is the performance of the real, physical computer running the
<BR>
VR. No matter how fancy the VR is, no VR person (or computer) can ever do
<BR>
more computations than the underlying hardware.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It could also be possible to reduce the cost of erasure or even avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it altogether, by the trick of running the simulation forward while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preserving all the extra bits, then running it backwards to erase the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calculation and the extra bits.  You can do this every so often and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just snapshot the state that is needed to proceed with the calculation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The result is that many erasures wouldn't get counted, only those which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are necessary to go from one snapshot to the next.
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't need a VR to do that. In fact, it would be much more efficient to
<BR>
dispense with the VR entirely.
<BR>
<P>A VR is very useful for modifying the subjective experiences of people (or
<BR>
other information processing entities), but it doesn't increase the amount
<BR>
of computation that can be done with a given supply of physical matter,
<BR>
energy and time.
