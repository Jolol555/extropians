<EM>&gt;&gt; I didn't know we lived in a oppressive society? A question: since Europeans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; live in an oppressive society and legal system, how come we never riot as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; it happens in LA? No racism?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Never riot?  Perhaps there are Europeans, and Europeans.  When I lived in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Zurich, I saw a very nice, full-out riot in the center of the city - complete
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with broken windows up and down the Bahnhofstrasse, riot police, looting, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything else you might want.  I also saw skinhead attacks more than once,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and quite blatant police brutality numerous times.  I actually became more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;concerned for my safety walking around there sometimes than I am home in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;NYC - because in Zurich, I found I wasn't able to accurately sense that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;situation was becoming dangerous - the violent things I saw happen seemed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to come out of nowhere.
</EM><BR>
<P>So Zurich stopped being a member of my &quot;future places to visit&quot; list.

<EM>&gt;I don't know what kind of exaggeration you get on your media, but we see all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kinds of rioting in the news going on in europe: the french on trade and labor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reforms, the germans against immigrants, then you've got your organized violence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the Balkan states.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me remind you of my words: &quot;. . . how come we never riot as it happens
<BR>
in LA?&quot; Skinheads attacks are not riots as it happens in LA. The Yugoslavia
<BR>
war is not a riot, it's a war (what's next, WW2?) Soccer fans rioting on a
<BR>
square -- destroying cars, robbing stores, etc. -- is not a riot as it
<BR>
happens in LA. I didn't said there were no riots in Europe; I said European
<BR>
riots are nothing close to US ones. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Not so. Only a fraction of violent crime here is gun related, and I did not say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that every American has a gun. I did say that there were about 240 million guns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the US. Most gun owners own more than one gun. Moreover, not all gun owners
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;carry a gun, and those with carry permits do not carry at all times.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Having a gun when contfronted with an armed criminal (knife, club, etc)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;increases your survivability by a factor of 2.5. on average.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't feel like discussing guns issues; nothing I can say will change your
<BR>
mind and it's unlikely you will change mine; so it's a useless argument. I
<BR>
think, in general, the US' position towards guns leads to a decrease in
<BR>
security and quality of life; you disagree and think it's the guns that keep
<BR>
you safe. The end.

<EM> &gt; As I've said before, almost everyone I have known personally that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; has visited europe has been robbed at least once while they were
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; there, they've had their hotel rooms robbed, their cars broken into or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; stolen, and bags snatched out of their hands.
</EM><BR>
<P>Although I don't have stats I'm pretty sure that, for example, Spain or
<BR>
Italy have higher non-violent crime rates than the US.
