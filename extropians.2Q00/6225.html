<P>
Greenstar looks promising, but I am afraid that their current ideas
<BR>
about ecommerce are not going to succeed.  It's ironic that they would
<BR>
be promoting the idea that these villages can make money selling MP3s and
<BR>
artwork just when the world is beginning to grapple with the possibility
<BR>
that such commerce will soon be obsolete.
<BR>
<P>Occasionally in the past the third world has found itself moving into
<BR>
new technologies just as the west abandons them, so that the developing
<BR>
countries find themselves obsoleted before they begin.  In order
<BR>
to prevent this it is necessary for them to perform a leapfrog step,
<BR>
bypassing the mistakes of the past and moving directly into the future.
<BR>
Theoretically they have the advantage of not having an established
<BR>
infrastructure which can put a damper on the rate of change.
<BR>
<P>Lee Crocker introduced us to the Freenet project a few months ago, which,
<BR>
along with the better-known Napster and Gnutella, provides a technology
<BR>
which is intended to support uncensorable and uncontrollable publishing
<BR>
and sharing of all sorts of information, even proprietary data like
<BR>
music and images.  If these systems succeed, and momentum continues to
<BR>
move in that direction, a new model will be needed for profiting from
<BR>
information products.  Some work has begun in this area.  The creator
<BR>
of Freenet has indicated that he is trying to put together a commercial
<BR>
enterprise to develop these ideas.
<BR>
<P>Without the drag of the big entertainment lobbies like the RIAA and
<BR>
MPAA trying their best to hold the system to a 100 year old model of
<BR>
information distribution, third world operators could be ideally situated
<BR>
to move nimbly into a world in which it is infeasible to prevent sharing
<BR>
of data.  I'm not suggesting that they become havens for pirated data,
<BR>
rather that Greenstar keep up with what is happening in this area.
<BR>
Perhaps they could set up some pilot projects for this new model for
<BR>
ecommerce as it begins to come into existence over the next year or two.
<BR>
