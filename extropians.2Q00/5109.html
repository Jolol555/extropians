Ok so now someone has posted to the list, AND cc'd me that I am  &quot;wrong&quot;, so 
<BR>
I have to sayit : 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  And I see why you did, but your response seems as wrong, basically, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  someone getting righteous about the use of the word `niggardly' because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  *sort of sounds so offensive*.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>No.
<BR>
*I* am not wrong.
<BR>
<P>Nigger and Niggardly sound a lot alike, but they mean different things.
<BR>
<P>He didn't say 'les beans', or 'let's be in'. He said (dumb, ugly, 
<BR>
treehugging) Lesbian.
<BR>
<P>That was a purely uncivilized wisecrack, a disgusting sentiment and he needed 
<BR>
his ass kicked. 
<BR>
<P>Stringing all those words together made a stereotype of a gay female that I 
<BR>
found extremely insulting. And I am not even GAY! (Tried that,  didnt work ; 
<BR>
- ) In light of what we are about (intellect, best behavior, learning, 
<BR>
self-improvement) it was demeaning to the entire list in it's callousness and 
<BR>
cruelty.
<BR>
<P>The fact that Lee actually *did not know that is how he sounded* lets me know 
<BR>
I did the right thing - &quot;go ballistic&quot; - now he knows. Hopefully he'll think 
<BR>
twice before making those kind of statements. Maybe not -- Lee, seems you 
<BR>
love to get a rise out.
<BR>
<P>I agree this is a HUGE mountain out of a molehill, and I am over it, but try 
<BR>
being a &quot;chick for a day&quot;, all you men.  You'd go ballistic even quicker.
<BR>
<P>N
<BR>
I am offlist for awhiles... good luck y'all.
<BR>
