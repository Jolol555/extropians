<P>Unlikely explaination.  The soviet infantry anti-tank misssles, unlike the
<BR>
American's, had seperate launchers and controllers.  The missles were
<BR>
controlled by a guy with a box and a joystick guiding the missle to the
<BR>
target.  The (expended) launcher could be a hundred meters away or more.
<BR>
This is *very* hard to do acurrately, so likely the Isreali tank (if the
<BR>
story is true at all) was just missed many times before it was hit.  The
<BR>
American wired guided missles are all one piece, and *much* easier to use
<BR>
since, being in direct line with the tank and missle, all you have to do
<BR>
is keep the crosshairs on target...the control box does the rest.
<BR>
<P>*They* have the problem you described above, and require a great amount of
<BR>
testicular fortitude to use against a main battle tank.  Bear in mind,
<BR>
though, that visibility out of any tank is *terrible*.  If they are busy
<BR>
engaging another target at the time and the battlefield is very active,
<BR>
chances are pretty good they won't see your launch.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I've heard that the age of armor (tanks) is over with the invention of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; shoulder launched anti tank rockets....but is that true?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not yet.  They aren't (and never were) much use in urban or jungle
<BR>
warfare, but aircraft have done much more to reduce the utility of tanks
<BR>
than shoulder launched missles.  If you have air superiority, or if it is
<BR>
even seriously being contested, the tank is still the master of the battle
<BR>
field.
