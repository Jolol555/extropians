<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure I completely understand where you are coming
<BR>
from.  Could you help me out a bit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One, you're humans, and suffering is wrong; two, you're humans who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tend to be important to the Singularity, and suffering might detract
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from that; three, I care about you, too.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you say suffering is wrong do you mean it is wrong that
<BR>
Sasha died, or wrong for us to suffer over his death?  Are you saying
<BR>
that we shouldn't be talking about sasha's death, but instead should
<BR>
be working to bring about the singularity...?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even so, the decrease in pain and suffering that might result from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signing up for cryonics is not as great as the decrease in pain and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffering that could be brought about by helping the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Singularitarians who remain, or (since I haven't, in fact, signed up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for insurance) brought about by spending my money on Singularitarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efforts now.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me if I have this right.  Are you saying that instead of
<BR>
spending $120K on cryonic preservation we should donate that $120K to
<BR>
computer R&amp;D or something that would bring the singularity here
<BR>
faster?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's just that, at least in theory, my life is not intrinsically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worth more than anyone else's, and is therefore a vanishing quantity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in any equation which refers to six billion people.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some day I hope to be like a God that can be very intimate with
<BR>
trillions of people and more all at the same time.  Some day I hope to
<BR>
feel more pain and suffering if one of those trillions dies, than I do
<BR>
know when one of the 100 or so extropians I know dies.  The
<BR>
singularity or when we start approaching the infinite it will
<BR>
certainly amplify, not diminish the importance of 1 in 6 billion will
<BR>
it not?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I will confess to the extremely immodest but factually correct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; belief that my actions now have a significant probability of saving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; billions of lives, which provides a utilitarian justification for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socially acceptable forms of selfishness such as not shipping all my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money to starving Freedonia or whatever
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm, I think I almost understand this.  So you are saying
<BR>
that the $120K spent on cryonic preservation could be instead spent on
<BR>
something that has the possibility of saving billions of lives right?
<BR>
If so this makes some sens and I must admit it is a good point.  So
<BR>
you are saying you're going to give up your chance at eternal life,
<BR>
forgo cryonic suspension, with the hope that doing so will save 6
<BR>
billion others?  I guess if it even had a reasonable chance of saving
<BR>
20 or 30 of our children you'd be a real hero I'd think.  If so, what
<BR>
is it you're working on or pushing for that might accomplish such?
<BR>
