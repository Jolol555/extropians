<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mike@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Death%20Penalty%20(was%20Re:%20Didn't%20need%20no%20welfare%20state)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000420195940.52354.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">mike@datamann.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;a) there is no 'thrill' or 'rush' from packing heat. Anyone who does so for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;purpose or to get the chance to use it on somebody shouldn't be carrying, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should really reexamine why they are carrying. This is the typical response 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the hoplophobes, that people who carry are a bunch of bloodthirsty sadists 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wanna go out and kick ass. This couldn't be further from the truth. To have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;carry permit, you have to be one of the more squeaky clean and non-violent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people in your society. When I applied for my permit, the cops called 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at least half a dozen people who knew me (not people I had given as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;references,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as, according to the police chief, &quot;Those people are gonna say nice things 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you.&quot;) and asked questions like 'is he a violent person?', 'has he ever 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mean to animals?', etc...which led to some interesting phone calls to me 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;later
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the week....they also did a 50 state and a federal background check for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;criminal record (even though state law says its not required).
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you kidding me?  This is supposed to convince me that people who carry 
<BR>
guns are the most &quot;squeaky clean and non-violent people&quot; in society?  That, 
<BR>
as you like to say, is rich!
<BR>
<P>Clue:  the cops who killed Amadou Diallo and the cops who sodomized Abner 
<BR>
Louima and the cops in LA's Rampart Precinct who apparently routinely 
<BR>
framed, beat and shot innocent people *all* passed the same sort of 
<BR>
background test you're talking about.
