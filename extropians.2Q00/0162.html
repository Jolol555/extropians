<EM>&gt; You're right, Daniel, that people in general lost interest in visionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technological programs and, for years I thought that was the only reason
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;the space program&quot; ran aground in the 1970s.  But I've come to a
</EM><BR>
different
<BR>
<EM>&gt; conclusion now.  The truth is that space didn't pay and with 20th century
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology it never could.  I've yet to see a good economic justification
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the kind of truly massive public spending required to do anything outside
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; LEO with that kind of technology and, believe me, I WANT to see such a
</EM><BR>
thing.
<BR>
<P>Not completely true.  Space access would have been cheaper under a free
<BR>
market regime from the start.  Recall where Goddard got his funding from.
<BR>
<P>But be that as it may, the problem is not that space access is expensive,
<BR>
but that the governments subsidize space programs to begin with.  This made
<BR>
private launches untenable.  Surely, government programs cost more, BUT the
<BR>
whole cost is not passed on to Hughes or other users of government launch
<BR>
vehicles.  Instead, the taxpayer funds that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm no rocket scientist (but I play one when I take people down to MSC for
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; tour), but I think simply reproducing the Saturn V would get you nowhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fast.  It was designed on the premise of non-reusability and LOTS of
</EM><BR>
public
<BR>
<EM>&gt; money.  I think you agree that that design philosophy is NOT the way to
</EM><BR>
go.
<BR>
<P>The main point is: it's a proven technology.  Ergo, you don't have to spend
<BR>
lots on R&amp;D to come up with your super special design.  A secondary point
<BR>
is: reusability does NOT guarantee efficiency.  The American Space Shuttle
<BR>
is proof that reusable vehicles can cost more to fly and maintain.  Remember
<BR>
also, if you're making a disposable launch vehicle, then you need not worry
<BR>
about a lot of maintenance problems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Daniel, if you're going to ask Earth to support an extraterrestrial
</EM><BR>
economy,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I think you have to come up with an economic rationale.  I'm waiting . . .
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't mean that at all.  What I mean is that the Biosphere concept has got
<BR>
to be put into the context of merely one plan to colonize and exploit space.
<BR>
I would rather look for a way to get the resources that will be spent in
<BR>
other ways, such as, e.g. (and this is just an example; I'm trying to break
<BR>
people out of the Biosphere idea), oxygen from Moon rocks, than worry about
<BR>
a delicate ecosystem recycling my oxygen.
<BR>
<P>As for economic rationales, there are plenty.  Power from orbiting
<BR>
satellites is an oldie.  Manufactured goods from space is another.  Moving
<BR>
pollution creating industries to space is another.  Moving dangerous biotech
<BR>
and nanotech research off the Earth.  Tourism.  Etc.
<BR>
<P>L8R!
