Gattaca is a classy sci-fi movie about a future world where your genetic
<BR>
endowment essentially determines the opportunities open to you in life.
<BR>
It follows the character of Vincent.  Conceived in the back seat of a
<BR>
car and without the genetic tailoring that is necessary for success,
<BR>
his dreams of going into space seem impossible.  &quot;The only way you'll
<BR>
see the inside of a space ship is if you're cleaning its toilet,&quot; his
<BR>
father tells him cruelly but accurately.
<BR>
<P>It is only by borrowing another man's identity and genetic heritage,
<BR>
painstakingly faking the routine genetic testing which is used for
<BR>
even minor transactions, that Vincent is able to work for the Gattaca
<BR>
Corporation as a planner with the hope of eventually going on a space
<BR>
mission himself.  He must live with the constant fear that his deception
<BR>
will be discovered, and things get much worse when his boss is murdered...
<BR>
<P>Gattaca will be on TV this Saturday the 20th on the Sci-Fi channel.
<BR>
Here in California it is at 6 PM.  It's worth watching if you haven't
<BR>
seen it.
<BR>
