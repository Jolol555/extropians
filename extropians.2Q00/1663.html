<EM>&gt; &quot;You folks&quot;? Come on, Mike! Why are you turning collectivist suddenly? Who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly are &quot;you folks&quot;? Are you including me? I'm British by birth, having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lived there for my first 23 years. I'm a quarter Irish by descent. And I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; American by residence and by closest cultural identification. Am I one one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of those darned imperialist bad guys, or am I one of the good guys?

<EM>&gt;

<P>Sorry Max, and apologies to all who take offense. However you ARE 3/4
<BR>
British, right? ;) I keep hearing all sorts of lame arguments about how
<BR>
anyone white owes black people, native americans, japanese, etc.
<BR>
apologies for what SOME white people did, yet these same people don't
<BR>
want the same argument applied to them. At the time scots were getting
<BR>
shipped to NI by the british, my own family was getting booted out of
<BR>
scotland, and by some quirk got sent to Nova Scotia instead. I suppose
<BR>
if they'd gotten sent to Ulster then I'd be one of the 'bad orange guys'
<BR>
now too.
<BR>
<P>The whole situation is a lesson, I think, in why government cannot be
<BR>
allowed to possess the power it so often has and wields in such corrupt
<BR>
and evil ways. The last people who should be trying the argument of 'the
<BR>
past is past, let bygones be bygones' is the British Government, which
<BR>
is what my point originally was. Bygones can't be bygones when you've
<BR>
been offed by some government goon, and the vicious cycle of violence
<BR>
started in one place, and thats in the seat of the british government.
<BR>
<P>We see this here in the US in the form of police and other government
<BR>
agency swat teams conducting midnight raids in full specwar gear on the
<BR>
homes of innocent, law abiding citizens, wrecking their homes, and
<BR>
shooting innocent people in their beds, all because of a typo on a
<BR>
warrant, or because some druggie made up an address for his dealer in
<BR>
order to get a better deal. Does the government compensate these people
<BR>
for their losses? No. Are any police charged with crimes for these
<BR>
offenses (even though an improper or illegal warrant, or a search
<BR>
without one is at least a misdemeanor in most states, and killing an
<BR>
innocent person in the conduct of an illegal raid (even if its from a
<BR>
heart attack) is technically supposed to be a capital murder charge? No,
<BR>
no police are ever charged with these crimes (typically they get
<BR>
commendations and promotions, a la Lon Horiuchi).
<BR>
<P>I was actually surprised that Reno's swat team didn't either shoot
<BR>
anybody or burn the place down in Miami. I tried to find out if Lon
<BR>
Horiuchi was on scene, but decided since nobody got their brains blown
<BR>
out, he must not have been there.
