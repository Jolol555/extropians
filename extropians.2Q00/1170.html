<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is that what their real last name is? I'd wondered. I thought calling themselves 'the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Windsors' was a bit too much of a pose. Is the Gotha from Prince Phillip?
</EM><BR>
<P>Naah. Saxe-Coburg Gotha was the old family name. They changed it
<BR>
to Windsor by deed poll in 1916 or thereabouts, because it sounded
<BR>
far too German and kept reminding people that Kaiser Wilhelm II was
<BR>
actually George V's cousin. (To say nothing of being the Tsar's first
<BR>
cousin. Europe back in 1914 was effectively owned by a couple of families,
<BR>
and Queen Victoria -- who had about ten sprogs in her time -- was the
<BR>
glue that bound them together.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If Tony Blair tossed over the Queen if she got 'uppity', he definitely could get away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with it, but would it be legal? I don't think so.
</EM><BR>
<P>It _would_ be, but the logic is remarkably convoluted. What would happen
<BR>
would be a constitutional crisis. The outcome of a constitutional crisis
<BR>
that pits the monarch against parliament is that the monarch loses -- at
<BR>
least, every time since the English Civil War. The solution is usually for
<BR>
the reigning monarch to abdicate and be replaced by a more 
<BR>
tractable^H^H^H^Hreasonable one. (Example: Edward VIII, abdication crisis.)
<BR>
<P>The thing is, the monarch cannot legislate. Nor can the monarch issue
<BR>
executive orders. The *crown* issues executive orders, and although the
<BR>
crown derives its authority from the monarchy, its power is actually
<BR>
delegated to the government, in the person of the cabinet of ministers
<BR>
(with the prime minister notionally acting as first among equals, rather
<BR>
than being a presidential figure -- though you wouldn't know it to look
<BR>
at recent history). So the queen may stamp and shout and scream &quot;I won't
<BR>
do it!&quot; but she doesn't actually have the legal authority _not_ to do
<BR>
it (whatever it is). Just to go on strike.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; That wasn't really my point, anyway. My point was that the power structures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that replaced the authoritarian monarchs may have notionally derived their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; authority from the people rather than &quot;because God _said_ I was better than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you peasants&quot;, but *it's still a power structure*, with many of the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; attributes and relationships to the outside world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, however it subsumes that power structure under the authority of the people,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather than the other way around. They can change that power structure if they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficient will to do so, and theoretically thats what they do every election (I know,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thats a real funny one Mike). Theoretically, the people now have the right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eliminate that power structure entirely, legally.
</EM><BR>
<P>Theoretically. In practice the people *immediately* delegated their
<BR>
sovreignty to a bunch of elected representatives; executive power ditto.
<BR>
And now they can't, *in practice*, get the power back -- any more than
<BR>
Lizzie Windsor can declare herself feudal monarch and demand her rights
<BR>
to my body under droit de seigneur.
