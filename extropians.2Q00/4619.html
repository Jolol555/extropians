<EM>&gt; Last minute cases are Bad. There's a reason Alcor doesn't do them, at

<EM>&gt; least lately.

<P>Gene what is last minute?  How much notice is needed?  Is a few days
<BR>
enough?  My mother was convinced by me to do cryonics [59 yrs, healthy]
<BR>
but does not want to put up any monthly fee, but does have money [30k
<BR>
would not be a problem] so what kind of forewarning is needed?
<BR>
<P>Looks to me like the most difficult part is making the rest of the 
<BR>
family understand that decapitation of a corpse is not revolting, 
<BR>
and that there will be a closed coffin, etc.  I understand that 
<BR>
more is better, but can you or someone else give me an idea how 
<BR>
much notice is needed for Alcor?  spike
