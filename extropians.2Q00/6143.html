<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We would all be having a lot more fun if someone formed a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Committee on Un-Extropian Activities that would ruthlessly mock every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; post that didn't have something useful to say.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; WOW is this our own gentle Eliezer that wrote this?  Hand over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the ransom note, where have you stashed him?  {8-]  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I've thought this for a while, of course I probably shouldn't be on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;committee, since I tend to prefer to shoot first and swear the carcass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in later...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's obvious from your heavy handed, doltish response to Brian.
</EM><BR>
<P>I tolerated a whole lot of shit from that twerp, and was quite patient.
<BR>
There comes a point where you have to give someone advice to either shut
<BR>
up or ship out after they've made such a royal ass of themselves and
<BR>
they are not smart enough to leave the party. Brian has demonstrated
<BR>
such a lack of intelligence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to quote one of Jim Halperin's characters: &quot;Some people just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;need killin'&quot;...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are a sick, stupid, frightening bastard.
</EM><BR>
<P>And you, sir, are a hypersensitive, supercilious, unhumorous git.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now we have evidence not just of cultism, but DANGEROUS cultism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hardly. I need no cult or any support from others to tell when someone
<BR>
is being a moron, a smeghead, an idiot, or otherwise a general lout, and
<BR>
I don't shy away from telling people when they are acting that way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm outta here.
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; P.S. Don't you people realize that the ai's in charge of reviving you will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be looking at this list's archives? Unlike people like you, Mike, the ai's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be smart enough to follow the logic of people like Brian without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running out of thought space before the end of the logical chain gets fed in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I picture symbols going into your head as others get squeezed out the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; side), and will regard you as far less worthy of reviving than Brian 
</EM><BR>
<P>Frankly, I doubt it. They'll see how he equates opinions against
<BR>
circumcision with anti-semitism and walk away laughing, saying &quot;Well, if
<BR>
we do wake this one, we'll definitely have to do some rewiring, we
<BR>
certainly can't allow such illogical people to just wander the streets,
<BR>
they might hurt themselves.&quot;
<BR>
<P>They may think I'm dangerous, but relative to their own standards, I
<BR>
won't be much different from anyone else from our age, and anyways,
<BR>
there is always a need for dangerous people in any age. If they want to
<BR>
send me off exploring distant space, thats fine with me, I have little
<BR>
intention of living in a society of lotus eating pacifistic socialists,
<BR>
if thats the sort of society you think will evolve in the future.
<BR>
Frankly I don't think such a society will.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, you may well have killed Brian before freezing yourself - please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't; pretty please? and me neither! I'm just stickin' up for someone who's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been treatedly *really* stupidly).
</EM><BR>
<P>Act stupidly and you will get treated as one treats an idiot. Brian has
<BR>
NOT acted at all intelligently on the list, his careless and
<BR>
inconsiderate tendency to insult and attack anyone who disagreed with
<BR>
him, then claim no hard feelings is just the tip of the iceberg.
