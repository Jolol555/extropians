<P>
The following sentences are from Extropian Principles Version 3.0:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Transhumanists take humanism further by challenging human limits by means
<BR>
of science and technology combined with critical and creative thinking.&quot;
<BR>
...
<BR>
<P>&quot;This document deliberately does not specify particular beliefs,
<BR>
technologies, or conclusions.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The document doesn't offer a definition of technology; therefore, it seems
<BR>
safe to assume that for the purpose of interpreting the document the word is
<BR>
to be defined according to its generally accepted definition.  The
<BR>
dictionary I have sitting here on the shelf behind my desk (Webster's 9th
<BR>
New Collegiate) offers a definition of technology which I think is relevant
<BR>
to a recent post by Robert-Coyote which implies that the means used to grow
<BR>
food crops should not be considered technology.  Here's the definition:
<BR>
<P>technology:  the totality of the means employed to provide objects necessary
<BR>
for human sustenance and comfort.
<BR>
<P>So, Robert-Coyote, I'm wondering why you think that the means to grow food
<BR>
in beach sand with no fossil fuel consumed and without adding shipped-in
<BR>
fertilisers, does not qualify as technology.  The predominate method of food
<BR>
production used these days requires an input of several calories of fossil
<BR>
fuel for each calorie of food obtained (including the manufacture, shipping,
<BR>
and operation of farm equipment &amp; the manufacture, shipping, and handling of
<BR>
fertilisers and pesticides, the figure's between 3 and 5 calories input for
<BR>
every 1 calorie obtained--and I apologize for not having references for
<BR>
these figures handy.  I'm looking through my stuff trying to find some).
<BR>
This is not good economics. It's a lousy technology, and from what I've seen
<BR>
of most of the molecular-genetic technology being marketed, some of it will
<BR>
help some, but it's not gonna change an overall lousy technology into a good
<BR>
one.
<BR>
<P>Now you might argue that trans-humans won't need food.  And maybe at some
<BR>
point they won't.  But I'll bet YOU do, and it's a safe bet that everyone on
<BR>
this list needs food in order to stay alive.
<BR>
<P>You might also argue that the only &quot;true&quot; technology is that which is
<BR>
developed in highly funded labs using all the latest high-dollar equipment.
<BR>
I suspect this is what you believe. I think you're wrong about this and that
<BR>
the research I'm doing will likely be more valuable as a means of sustaining
<BR>
human (or early trans-human) life than much of what's touted as &quot;high tech.&quot;
