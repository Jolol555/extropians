a book review and then got longer), and I was almost finished

with it before the thought of copyright crossed my mind.  But
<BR>
then it did, and while I'm submitting the article anyway, I'm

also prepending this slight cringe.
<BR>
<P>A SPRING-POWERED THEORY OF CONSCIOUSNESS
<BR>
<P>I don't know if anyone has mentioned or reviewed this book on the
<BR>
Extropians' list (the search engine at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists</A> hasn't been working for a while
<BR>
:-&lt; ), but I thought I'd make a few rambling remarks about the
<BR>
recently-published _A Universe of Consciousness_ by Gerald
<BR>
M. Edelman (in collaboration with Giulio Tononi), subtitled &quot;How
<BR>
Matter Becomes Imagination&quot; (Basic Books, New York, 2000).  I'll
<BR>
also attempt to put these remarks in a larger context by drawing
<BR>
on Dr. Edelman's earlier books.
<BR>
<P>Edelman received a 1972 Nobel in Physiology and Medicine for his
<BR>
work in immunology (there is a bio of Edelman as of his 1972
<BR>
Nobel at <A HREF="http://www.nobel.se/laureates/medicine-1972-1-bio.html">http://www.nobel.se/laureates/medicine-1972-1-bio.html</A>).
<BR>
Since then, he has studied the embryology of the vertebrate
<BR>
nervous system (see the Chairman's Overview of the Department of
<BR>
Neurobiology at the Scripps Institute:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.scripps.edu/admin/dev/Overviews.html#NBIO">http://www.scripps.edu/admin/dev/Overviews.html#NBIO</A>).  More
<BR>
recently, (currently as director of the Neurosciences Institute
<BR>
in San Diego [<A HREF="http://www.nsi.edu">http://www.nsi.edu</A>]) he has been engaged in a
<BR>
rather ambitious attempt to create a no-nonsense theoretical
<BR>
foundation for the scientific study of consciousness itself (both
<BR>
the kind we share with other animals, and the kind that is
<BR>
supposed to be possessed only by human beings).  Edelman calls
<BR>
the former &quot;primary consciousness&quot;: the process which permits an
<BR>
animal to categorize the cacophony of &quot;unlabeled&quot; signals pouring
<BR>
in through various sensory modalities into objects and scenes,
<BR>
and to make rapid use of these signals to select among behavioral
<BR>
alternatives.  The so-called &quot;higher-order&quot; consciousness that
<BR>
seems to be unique to human beings is based on speech and other
<BR>
symbol systems (including formal logic), and encompasses the
<BR>
concept of the self in time past, present, and future, and the
<BR>
consciousness of being conscious.
<BR>
<P>I first ran into Edelman eight years ago, when I picked up a copy
<BR>
of his book written for the popular audience _Bright Air,
<BR>
Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind_ (Basic Books, New
<BR>
York, 1992).  I was impressed by this book for two reasons --
<BR>
first, because it took biological underpinnings much more
<BR>
seriously than discussions I had previously encountered on the
<BR>
subject of human cognition, and secondly because of the rather
<BR>
breathtaking (not to say arrogant) scope of the book -- nothing
<BR>
less than a complete theory of how the human mind results from
<BR>
the structure and function of the brain.  Reading this book, I
<BR>
could (and still can) convince myself that I am getting a
<BR>
plausible story of the means by which the physical organization
<BR>
and operation of the brain might result in the subjective
<BR>
experiences and objective behavior we call &quot;mind&quot;, rather than
<BR>
the usual miscellaneous collection of facts about neuroanatomy
<BR>
and psychology, and symbolic models of this or that aspect of
<BR>
cognition, contained in such books.  Most volumes about the mind
<BR>
and brain that one might encounter at the local Borders or Barnes
<BR>
&amp; Noble contain no particular overarching theory, and typically
<BR>
shy away from any provocative claims (at least once you're past
<BR>
the cover and title page) of actually being able to &quot;explain&quot; the
<BR>
human mind.  On the other hand I have sometimes been daunted, in
<BR>
my efforts to follow Edelman's arguments, by what seems to be a
<BR>
rather tortured writing style that has caused me to have to read
<BR>
and re-read some passages of his books without, in the end, being
<BR>
entirely confident that I have understood them. In this regard,
<BR>
Edelman reminds me a little of B. F. Skinner, with whom I
<BR>
acquainted myself in the early 70's (via _Beyond Freedom and
<BR>
Dignity_, _Science and Human Behavior_, and other texts), and who
<BR>
had an idiosyncratic style and vocabulary that took some getting
<BR>
used to (all in the name of precision, I suppose, from the
<BR>
author's point of view).
<BR>
<P>_Bright Air, Brilliant Fire_ was intended by its author as a
<BR>
summary, and popular exposition, of some of his earlier books.
<BR>
After reading it I came across and purchased (pre-Amazon) some of
<BR>
Edelman's more specialist-oriented tomes (at the local mall's
<BR>
Borders, of all places -- the then-new brick-and-mortar
<BR>
mega-bookstores were amazing places!), including _Neural
<BR>
Darwinism: The Theory of Neuronal Group Selection_ (Basic Books,
<BR>
New York, 1987), _The Remembered Present: A Biological Theory of
<BR>
Consciousness_ (Basic Books, New York, 1989), and _Topobiology:
<BR>
An Introduction to Molecular Embryology_ (Basic Books, New York,
<BR>
1988).  I read all of _The Remembered Present_ a couple of years
<BR>
ago, but I have to admit that the other two volumes sit mostly
<BR>
unread on my shelves (except for the browsing I've been doing
<BR>
recently in _Neural Darwinism_ in conjunction with writing this
<BR>
article).
<BR>
<P>I have, since then, learned that Edelman has his detractors -- a
<BR>
short quote from the _New York Times Book Review_ article on _The
<BR>
Remembered Present_, at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.ftrbooks.com/psych/biological_consciousness/remembered_present.htm">http://www.ftrbooks.com/psych/biological_consciousness/remembered_present.htm</A>
<BR>
written by one Stuart Sutherland (presumably the late British
<BR>
psychologist, see <A HREF="http://epunix.susx.ac.uk/EP/stuart.html">http://epunix.susx.ac.uk/EP/stuart.html</A>), gives
<BR>
a taste of one Edelman critic.  Edelman is also lambasted in John
<BR>
Horgan's 1996 book _The End of Science_ (Little, Brown; London;
<BR>
1996, pp. 165-172; Horgan's interview with Edelman is,
<BR>
admittedly, snottily funny).  F. H. C. Crick's dismissal of
<BR>
&quot;Neural Darwinism&quot; (both the book and the theory, presumably) as
<BR>
&quot;Neural Edelmanism&quot; was actually chosen by Edelman as the
<BR>
epigraph to Chapter 9 of _Bright Air, Brilliant Fire_ (p. 81).
<BR>
However, having no one but myself to please when it comes to
<BR>
choosing books for my own entertainment, and having a somewhat
<BR>
faded memory of my earlier forays into &quot;Edelmanism&quot;, I was
<BR>
motivated to purchase and read Edelman's latest attempt at
<BR>
popular explication of his ideas, both to see what might be new
<BR>
and also in hope of a clearer and more engagingly-written
<BR>
restatement of the earlier material.  I first contemplated
<BR>
writing this article as a review of the newest book, but then it
<BR>
became an attempt, for my own benefit if no one else's, to
<BR>
refresh my memory of Edelman's earlier books and to place the
<BR>
latest book in context with them.
<BR>
<P>So here follow my rambles -- a selection of the points that
<BR>
remain in my head a few days after having finished _A Universe of
<BR>
Consciousness_ [&quot;UoC&quot;] (and months or years after having read
<BR>
_The Remembered Present_ [&quot;RP&quot;] and _Bright Air, Brilliant Fire_
<BR>
[&quot;BABF&quot;], though with a good deal of refurbishment from
<BR>
consulting those earlier volumes, and _Neural Darwinism_ [&quot;ND&quot;]
<BR>
too, in order to write this paper).  Any inaccuracies or
<BR>
misrepresentations in my remarks are strictly my own fault
<BR>
(dammit I'm a computer programmer not a neurobiologist, Jim!)  My
<BR>
intention is merely to provide motivation to anyone on this list
<BR>
who might be ripe for a dip into these volumes (possibly with a
<BR>
more serious purpose than I have).  I am certainly not in a
<BR>
position to offer expert scientific criticism of any of Edelman's
<BR>
ideas, or even to compare and contrast Edelman's popular
<BR>
expositions of his ideas with those of other authors (such as
<BR>
William H. Calvin, a few of whose books I have purchased
<BR>
recently, partly as a result of getting back into Edelman, but
<BR>
which I have not yet read).  For a bird's-eye view of much of
<BR>
what follows, see the diagrams in RP pp. 241 (Fig. 14.1), 256
<BR>
(Fig. 15.1); BABF p. 134 (Fig. 12-5).
<BR>
<P>Early in UoC (p. 14; see also RP p. 19; BABF p. 113), Edelman
<BR>
makes clear that his theorizing is based on what he calls the
<BR>
&quot;physics assumption&quot;.  He dismisses dualism (any notion that
<BR>
there's a special &quot;mind stuff&quot; existing on a different physical
<BR>
plane or in a different explanatory realm from ordinary matter or
<BR>
ordinary physical processes [cf. the philospher's joke &quot;What is
<BR>
mind?  No matter.  What is matter?  Never mind.&quot; mentioned by
<BR>
Bertrand Russell in his autobiography; the joke was a favorite of
<BR>
his grandmother's, and expressed her attitude of derision toward
<BR>
&quot;metaphysics&quot;: _The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell_ Vol. 1,
<BR>
p. 48 of the Bantam paperback edition]).  In the next breath
<BR>
Edelman dismisses the notion that consciousness is based on
<BR>
&quot;exotic&quot; physics such as quantum gravity (as invoked, for
<BR>
example, by Sir Roger Penrose, see BABF pp. 212-218).  He also
<BR>
espouses what he calls the &quot;evolutionary assumption&quot; -- that
<BR>
whatever consciousness is, it is the product of the phylogenetic
<BR>
history and evolution by natural selection of life on earth,
<BR>
which encompasses the origin and history of the human species.
<BR>
<P>Edelman believes that individual neurons do not have independent
<BR>
functions in the brain, but participate in larger entities he
<BR>
calls &quot;neuronal groups&quot;, at several levels of organization. The
<BR>
lowest-level groups are those of the &quot;primary repertoire&quot;: these
<BR>
are distinct sets of neighboring cells, each containing between
<BR>
50 and 10,000 neurons (RP p. 47 [Fig. 3.2]; BABF pp. 88-89
<BR>
[Fig. 9-3]) which have, during the course of embryogenesis and
<BR>
infancy, formed connections with each other preferentially to
<BR>
their connections with neurons outside their own group.  This
<BR>
&quot;developmental selection&quot; of brain wiring (UoC p. 84 [Fig. 7.2];
<BR>
ND Chap. 4, p. 199 [Fig. 7.8]; RP pp. 44, 45 [Fig. 3.1], 46,
<BR>
240-242; BABF pp. 83, 84 [Fig 9-1]) takes place under the
<BR>
influence of the expression of morphoregulatory genes for Cell
<BR>
Adhesion Molecules, Substrate Adhesion Molecules, and Cell
<BR>
Junction Molecules (CAMs, SAMs, and CJMs) see ND pp. 158-159
<BR>
[Fig. 6.3]; BABF all of Chap. 6, esp. pp. 60, 61 [Fig. 6-4], and
<BR>
62; this is also the subject matter of _Topobiology_).  It occurs
<BR>
under juxtaposed conditions of mechanical and chemical constraint
<BR>
and confinement, in interaction with the supportive glial cells
<BR>
of the brain (ND pp. 112, 113 [Fig. 5.1]), and is also
<BR>
constrained and directed by the ongoing signalling of the
<BR>
developing brain, sensory, and motor systems -- the maxim here
<BR>
being &quot;neurons that fire together, wire together&quot; (UoC p. 83).
<BR>
<P>Edelman cites both theoretical considerations and experimental
<BR>
evidence in favor of the existence of the primary repertoire of
<BR>
neuronal groups, including the fact that while an individual
<BR>
neuron is either excitatory or inhibitory, neuronal groups can be
<BR>
both, in varying proportions (RP p. 51; BABF pp. 86-87).
<BR>
&quot;[G]roups come in different sizes, shapes, and types, depending
<BR>
upon their underlying anatomy, developmental constraints,
<BR>
synaptic properties, and inputs.  Some groups are more stable
<BR>
than others; for instance, some found in the visual cortex are
<BR>
fixed during developmental critical periods, while some in the
<BR>
somatosensory cortex are plastic.  A good example in the visual
<BR>
system is provided by orientation columns, the properties of
<BR>
which fulfill the criteria for neuronal groups: collections of
<BR>
locally and strongly interconnected neurons carrying out a
<BR>
discriminative function developed as a result of selectively
<BR>
correlated input signals (in this case tuning for orientation)&quot;
<BR>
(RP p. 52).  &quot;[T]here is no evidence that any... neuron has its
<BR>
properties **except** as a result of its synaptic interactions
<BR>
with multiple other neurons in a group and with distant neurons
<BR>
by reentry&quot; (RP p. 53).
<BR>
<P>At the early, rapid-growth stage of developmental selection,
<BR>
there is a literal Darwinian competition for survival among the
<BR>
still-proliferating neurons, and only those which manage to
<BR>
become functional members of neuronal groups escape death (ND
<BR>
pp. 111 [Table 5.1], 115; BABF pp. 23 [Fig. 3-3], 25).  Up to 70%
<BR>
of cells die during the development of some regions of the brain.
<BR>
&quot;Most of this death is not preprogrammed but depends upon the
<BR>
neuron connecting to the appropriate innervation field.  This
<BR>
must occur largely epigenetically and to some extent
<BR>
stochastically...&quot; (ND p. 115).
<BR>
<P>An important property of the neuronal groups which remain
<BR>
following this process is a certain degree of random variation in
<BR>
the connections within and between them, which nevertheless does
<BR>
not compromise their functional adequacy.  Edelman calls this
<BR>
lack of precise structural specificity &quot;degeneracy&quot; (defined in
<BR>
UoC on p. 86 as &quot;the capacity of structurally different
<BR>
components to yield similar outputs or results&quot;).  He claims that
<BR>
it occurs at many levels of organization in the brain (ND p. 58
<BR>
[Table 3.3]), and is an inevitable outcome of selectional
<BR>
processes as well as providing a source of variability that can
<BR>
be the basis for further ongoing selection (UoC pp. 86-87; ND
<BR>
pp. 46-59; RP pp. 50, 52-53).  Degeneracy is not merely tolerated
<BR>
but is essential to the brain's operation, &quot;to provide the
<BR>
overlapping but nonidentical response characteristics needed to
<BR>
cover a universe of possible stimuli&quot; (ND p. 50; RP p. 242).
<BR>
<P>An outcome of degeneracy is that there can be many alternative
<BR>
means and pathways, competitively selected out of a large
<BR>
population of variant possibilities, which can accomplish more or
<BR>
less adequately the same functional task.  The detailed physical
<BR>
structures which participate in a given task will therefore vary
<BR>
stochastically among brains depending on the vagaries of chance
<BR>
and personal history: no two brains (even those of identical
<BR>
twins) will contain identical populations of neurons or be wired
<BR>
identically (ND p. 34 [Fig. 2.6]; BABF pp. 25, 26 [Fig. 3-5]).
<BR>
Furthermore, the information contained in the human genome would
<BR>
be insufficient to precisely specify the synaptic structure of
<BR>
the developing brain (BABF p. 224).  Therefore, it certainly
<BR>
cannot be the case that the brain is precise and &quot;hardwired&quot; like
<BR>
a computer (BABF p. 27).
<BR>
<P>Superimposed on the process of developmental selection, and
<BR>
continuing throughout life, is a second process of &quot;experiential
<BR>
selection&quot; (UoC p. 84; ND Chap. 7; RP p. 46; BABF p. 84) in which
<BR>
the existence of a given set of synaptic connections among
<BR>
neurons and neuronal groups is more-or-less fixed, but in which
<BR>
the strength of these connections can become greater or less over
<BR>
time.  The synaptic circuits formed by the simultaneous activity
<BR>
of connected neuronal groups generally have a much greater
<BR>
spatial extent than the groups which comprise them (ND p. 166).
<BR>
Edelman considers the so-called &quot;secondary repertoire&quot; as a
<BR>
population of variant possibilities for widely-distributed
<BR>
patterns of synchronized firing of neuronal groups, whose
<BR>
participant synapses have been jointly strengthened, in varying
<BR>
degrees, due to repeated correlated activity in the past.  In
<BR>
contrast to classical Darwinism, which is predicated on
<BR>
differential **reproduction**, the partitioning of the primary
<BR>
repertoire of neuronal groups into the secondary repertoire of
<BR>
synaptic circuits is based on differential **amplification** (of
<BR>
the strength of synaptic connections [RP p. 53; BABF pp. 94-97]).
<BR>
The widely-distributed firing patterns of the secondary
<BR>
repertoire flicker in and out of existence depending on events in
<BR>
the organism and the world, with neuronal groups of the primary
<BR>
repertoire participating in different patterns of the secondary
<BR>
repertoire at different times.
<BR>
<P>The existence of neuronal groups means that intra-group synaptic
<BR>
connections (&quot;intrinsic connections&quot;) among the neurons in a
<BR>
group of the primary repertoire are denser than the inter-group
<BR>
(&quot;extrinsic&quot;) connections among the groups which create the
<BR>
circuits of the secondary repertoire.  In artificial neural
<BR>
networks lacking this hierarchy of interconnections, a learning
<BR>
rule (such as the Hebb rule) is typically chosen which permits
<BR>
synaptic strength to be changed by the correlated firing of the
<BR>
pre- and post-synaptic neuron; however Edelman cites experimental
<BR>
evidence (ND p. 181) suggesting that, in real brains, a large
<BR>
number of additional neurons, all connected to the presynaptic
<BR>
neuron, must participate in the correlated firing in order for
<BR>
the strength of the connection to a postsynaptic neuron to change
<BR>
(ND p. 201).  An interconnection hierarchy based on the existence
<BR>
of neuronal groups has consequences for the learning laws by
<BR>
which long- and short-term modifications of these circuits can
<BR>
occur, which are examined mathematically in ND (pp. 196-198), and
<BR>
which differ from those which characterize symmetrically-wired
<BR>
artificial neural networks (see also BABF p. 227).
<BR>
<P>Analogously to his view of the insignificance of the **individual
<BR>
neuron**, Edelman minimizes the contribution of the **individual
<BR>
synapse** to the behavior of the entire network: &quot;[T]he
<BR>
complexity of the nervous system makes it highly unlikely that
<BR>
there is a simple relationship between changes at any individual
<BR>
synapse and changes in the behavior of the network.  It is much
<BR>
more likely that multiple synaptic modifications occur
<BR>
simultaneously at various sites in the network, reflecting its
<BR>
degeneracy&quot; (ND p. 179).  The author also emphasizes the
<BR>
combinatorial increase in the richness of interactions made
<BR>
possible by the diversity of neurotransmitters and their
<BR>
receptors (ND pp. 203-204): &quot;A rich pharmacology thus assures a
<BR>
very rich set of functional network variants&quot; (ND p. 204).
<BR>
<P>Edelman's motivation for insisting on selection at the level of
<BR>
groups rather than of individual neurons seems to be that only
<BR>
the latter, in his view, permits a sufficiently fine-grained
<BR>
variation in the characteristics of the units of selection to
<BR>
allow functional niches to be filled by selective competition
<BR>
(under constraints of value) rather than by exact matching of
<BR>
neurons to prespecified correct responses (ND p. 47).
<BR>
Prespecified roles for individual neurons do occur in current
<BR>
neural-network models of computation (RP p. 53; BABF p. 227).
<BR>
Edelman mocks these models, in which &quot;individual neurons each
<BR>
correspond to a pattern of external events of the order of
<BR>
complexity of events symbolized by a word&quot;, by describing them as
<BR>
based on the &quot;grandmother neuron&quot; concept (i.e., the idea that
<BR>
there's a particular neuron that fires when you recognize your
<BR>
grandmother), which &quot;cannot explain categorization without
<BR>
begging the question&quot; (RP p. 53).
<BR>
<P>Edelman asserts that the results of developmental selection are
<BR>
&quot;grossly speaking, two kinds of nervous system organization that
<BR>
are important to understanding how consciousness evolved.  These
<BR>
systems are very different in their organization, even though
<BR>
they are both made up of neurons.  The first is the brain stem,
<BR>
together with the limbic (hedonic) system, the system concerned
<BR>
with appetite, sexual and consummatory behavior, and evolved
<BR>
defensive behavior patterns.  It is a value system; it is
<BR>
extensively connected to many different body organs, the
<BR>
endocrine system, and the autonomic nervous system.  Together,
<BR>
these systems regulate heart and respiratory rate, sweating,
<BR>
digestive functions, and the like.  It will come as no surprise
<BR>
to learn that the circuits in this limbic-brain stem system are
<BR>
often arranged in loops, that they respond relatively slowly (in
<BR>
periods ranging from seconds to months), and that they do not
<BR>
consist of detailed maps.  They have been selected during
<BR>
evolution to match the body, not to match large numbers of
<BR>
unanticipated signals from the outside world.  These systems
<BR>
evolved early to take care of bodily functions; they are systems
<BR>
of the interior&quot; (BABF p. 117; see also RP p. 152; UoC pp. 42, 43
<BR>
[Fig. 4.4], 44-47).
<BR>
<P>The second topology which plays a key role in Edelman's theory is
<BR>
characteristic of the thalamocortical system: &quot;The thalamus, a
<BR>
central brain structure, consists of many nuclei that connect
<BR>
sensory and other brain signals to the cortex...  The
<BR>
thalamocortical system consists of the thalamus and the cortex
<BR>
acting together, a system that evolved to receive signals from
<BR>
sensory receptor sheets and to give signals to voluntary muscles.
<BR>
It is very fast in its responses (taking from milliseconds to
<BR>
seconds), although its synaptic connections undergo some changes
<BR>
that last a lifetime...  [I]ts main structure, the cerebral
<BR>
cortex, is arranged in a set of maps, which receive inputs from
<BR>
the outside world via the thalamus&quot; (BABF p. 117, see also RP
<BR>
pp. 152, 165 [Fig. 9.4]; UoC p. 107).
<BR>
<P>In the cortex, neuronal groups are organized in the form of an
<BR>
&quot;interconnected six-layered sheet of about ten billion neurons
<BR>
with about a million billion connections...  arranged in
<BR>
functionally segregated maps that... subserve all the different
<BR>
sensory modalities and motor responses&quot; (BABF p. 104).  Edelman
<BR>
calls the maps into which the cortex is partitioned &quot;local maps&quot;
<BR>
(ND Chap. 5; RP p. 243; BABF pp. 22-25).  Further, the local maps
<BR>
of the cortex are in turn connected with each other and with the
<BR>
thalamus via massively parallel sets of reciprocal fibers, the
<BR>
whole forming a three-dimensional meshwork whose structure
<BR>
typifies the neural architecture of the thalamocortical system
<BR>
(Uoc p. 42).  &quot;Any perturbation in one part of the meshwork may
<BR>
be felt rapidly everywhere else.  Altogether, the organization of
<BR>
the thalamocortical meshwork seems remarkably suited to
<BR>
integrating a large number of specialists into a unified
<BR>
response&quot; (UoC p. 45).
<BR>
<P>The value systems (or, in this context, &quot;diffusely projecting
<BR>
value systems&quot; [UoC p. 43]) which control the body via the
<BR>
autonomic nervous and endocrine systems also connect to the
<BR>
thalamocortical system via ubiquitous fibers that fan out
<BR>
diffusely from various nuclei in the brainstem and hypothalamus,
<BR>
such as the serotonergic raphe nucleus, the dopaminergic nuclei,
<BR>
the cholinergic nuclei, and the histaminergic nuclei, and that
<BR>
project to most or all of the brain.  The locus coeruleus &quot;sends
<BR>
a diffuse sweeping 'hairnet' of fibers to cover the entire
<BR>
cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and spinal cord,
<BR>
and ... has the potential to affect billions of synapses&quot;.  The
<BR>
&quot;neuromodulators&quot; released at the synaptic connections formed by
<BR>
the diffuse projections of the value systems both bias the
<BR>
moment-to-moment activity of the circuits they project to, and
<BR>
affect their long-term plasticity (UoC pp. 46, 87-92).  They can
<BR>
signal to the entire brain the sudden occurrence of a
<BR>
pleasurable, painful, or novel stimulus, and together with other
<BR>
mechanisms of value (such as hormonal loops) provide input to the
<BR>
thalamocortical system related to the &quot;adaptive, homeostatic, and
<BR>
endocrine functions&quot; of the organism (UoC pp. 88-89; RP
<BR>
pp. 93-94; BABF p. 163).
<BR>
<P>Edelman also uses the term &quot;value&quot; in a more generalized sense to
<BR>
mean any boundary condition imposed by the organism's phenotype
<BR>
which constrains the developmental and experiential selection
<BR>
taking place in the brain, such as the way limbs are jointed (UoC
<BR>
p. 88): &quot;the mere fact of having a hand with a certain shape and
<BR>
a certain propensity to grasp in one way and not another
<BR>
enormously enhances the selection of synapses and neuronal
<BR>
patterns of activity that lead to appropriate actions.  The same
<BR>
actions would be almost impossible to synthesize or program from
<BR>
scratch, as experts in robotics know all too well.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The characteristic architecture of parallel, reciprocally
<BR>
interconnected local maps found in the thalamocortical system is
<BR>
called by the author &quot;reentry&quot; (UoC p. 105; ND p. 60; RP p. 47,
<BR>
Chap. 4; BABF p. 90 [Fig. 9-4], and is another key notion in
<BR>
Edelman's portfolio.  &quot;Reentry is a process of temporally ongoing
<BR>
parallel signalling between separate maps along ordered
<BR>
anatomical connections.  Reentrant signalling can take place via
<BR>
reciprocal connections between maps (as seen in corticocortical,
<BR>
corticothalamic, and thalamocortical radiations); it can also
<BR>
occur via more complex arrangements such as connections among
<BR>
cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum&quot; (RP p. 49).
<BR>
<P>The basal ganglia and cerebellum (together with the hippocampus)
<BR>
are instances of what Edelman calls &quot;cortical appendages&quot; (BABF
<BR>
p. 105 [Fig. 10-2], which function as &quot;organs of succession&quot;
<BR>
responsible for the sequencing of motor events controlling
<BR>
behavior, and of perceptual events comprising memory and the flow
<BR>
of consciousness (UoC pp. 45, 95; ND p. 227; RP p. 113, Chap. 7;
<BR>
BABF p. 105).  &quot;To handle time as well as space, the cortical
<BR>
appendages -- the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and hippocampus (see
<BR>
figure 10-2) -- evolved along with the cortex to deal with
<BR>
succession both in actual motion and in memory&quot; (BABF p. 118).
<BR>
<P>The reentrant connections between thalamocortical maps can be
<BR>
registered, convergent or divergent; arborized or non-arborized;
<BR>
layer-registered or non-layer-registered (RP p. 65 [Table 4.1],
<BR>
p. 66 [Fig. 4.1A]).  Temporally, reentrant signals may be
<BR>
periodic, intermittent (phasic), synchronous, or asynchronous (RP
<BR>
p. 68), and can be recursive via many paths (RP pp. 65, 69).  A
<BR>
particular fiber projecting from one receptor sheet or map may
<BR>
have simultaneous connections to more than one distinct target
<BR>
map: &quot;When maps are connected by reentrant fibers, the individual
<BR>
fibers generally extend their arbors over many locally linked
<BR>
neurons...  When secondary repertoires are formed, the
<BR>
strengthening of synapses **within** those arbors may then select
<BR>
neighboring groups of neurons, changing borders over smaller
<BR>
dimensions than those of the arbors&quot; (BABF pp. 86-87). Reentry
<BR>
may be &quot;horizontal&quot; among maps at a given layer of the cortex, or
<BR>
&quot;vertical&quot; among successive layers (RP p. 67).  If there are
<BR>
major changes in the characteristic sensory inputs to which an
<BR>
organism is exposed, there will be corresponding changes in the
<BR>
boundaries of the associated maps, and corresponding
<BR>
readjustments to the successive maps to which they project
<BR>
throughout the entire linked system (ND pp. 170-173 [and Fig. 6.7
<BR>
on p. 173]; RP p. 67 [Fig. 4.1]; BABF p. 26 [Fig. 3-5]).
<BR>
<P>Some local maps in the thalamocortical system of the brain
<BR>
(namely, the &quot;primary maps&quot;, see UoC p. 96 [Fig. 8.1]; RP p. 55
<BR>
[Fig. 3.4]; BABF p. 91 [Fig. 9-5]) are reentrantly connected to
<BR>
and receive input from sensory receptor sheets in multiple
<BR>
sensory modalities (and sub-modalities, such as motion or
<BR>
orientation detection in the visual system), including
<BR>
proprioceptive inputs from muscles and joints (ND pp. 108-110; RP
<BR>
p. 49; BABF p. 19).  &quot;The cerebral cortex is a structure adapted
<BR>
to receive a dense and rapid series of signals from the world
<BR>
through many sensory modalities simultaneously -- sight, touch,
<BR>
taste, smell, hearing, joint sense (feeling the position of your
<BR>
extremities).  It evolved later than the limbic-brain stem system
<BR>
to permit increasingly sophisticated motor behavior and the
<BR>
categorization of world events&quot; (BABF p. 118).
<BR>
<P>Some primary maps (such as those associated with vision or touch)
<BR>
are topographically connected with their corresponding receptor
<BR>
sheets: &quot;By 'topographic,' I refer to the situation in which a
<BR>
sensory receptor sheet receiving signals from the world connects
<BR>
to its recipient map in such a way that neighboring locations in
<BR>
the sensory sheet are also neighboring locations in the recipient
<BR>
map&quot; (BABF, p. 87).  Hence, a &quot;primary cerebral map may be
<BR>
considered to be a translation that makes it possible to sample
<BR>
and preserve selected coherent portions of the gross topographic
<BR>
order of the external scene in time and space&quot; (ND p. 109).
<BR>
While there is some topographic invariance maintaining &quot;certain
<BR>
basic features relating to the spatiotemporal continuity of an
<BR>
object&quot;, &quot;no point-to-point map has so far been shown to exist in
<BR>
the nervous system; instead, all local mappings studied have been
<BR>
point-to-area and area-to-area, consistent with the presence of
<BR>
degeneracy&quot; (ND p. 108).  Primary local maps are in turn
<BR>
reentrantly linked to multiple secondary maps in the sensory
<BR>
cortices, and via these to the frontal, temporal, and parietal
<BR>
cortices, and the motor cortex (UoC p. 96 [Fig. 8.1]; RP p. 55
<BR>
[Fig. 3.4]; BABF pp. 91 [Fig. 9-5], 109).
