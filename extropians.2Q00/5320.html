<EM>&gt;Phil Osborn spewed:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;| Funny, most of the professional developers I have known over the years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;| consider MS/DOS - Windows to be an unbelievable kludge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;First of all, Windows on MS/DOS *was* a kludge, but that hasn't existed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;since 3.1.  All of MS' 32-bit operating systems are *actually* operating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;systems, the DOS infrastructure is *minimal*.  In NT and 2000 DOS is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-existent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Phil spews in reply ) ) ) )
<BR>
Sorry, I work professionally all day on a Win98 system.  A good day is when 
<BR>
I only have to reboot 3 to 5 times.  I had a LOT more control with 3.1, in 
<BR>
fact.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;MS-oriented developers are the workhorse of the development community.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sure, talk to Java and C developers (I was one) and you'll hear a different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;viewpoint - inferiority complex.  With the advent of COM, there is not one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;real benefit to using even C++ over VB for app development (of course you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get some performance benefit in some cases - solution, write a C++ COM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;object for those situations and call it from anywhere).  With VB or any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;derived tools (i.e. ASP), a developer can be 2-3 times as productive than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with any of the aforementioned languages.  This is due in part to A) the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;APIs available to all of MS' products, which are as powerful, if not more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so, than open source, B) the amazing cross-functional IDEs (Integrated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Development Environments), and C) MS' excellent developer support network.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Right..  (spewing again)  And MS didn't specifically write the code to make 
<BR>
the competing development platforms lag?  Didn't hide the key hooks in their 
<BR>
OS?  Who's paying you to say these things?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The problem here is that the dot-com &quot;revolution&quot; has validated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hackers-gone-&quot;professional&quot;-developers who believe that nobly writing for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;open source software justifies constant troubleshooting and maintenance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When your burn rate is over $55,000/day, you cannot afford to write things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more than once - and we don't.  The days of building amazingly complex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scientific and enterprise applications on UNIX should be over.  There are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;better alternatives now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
(Spew)  Funny how many top systems people I know who regard that position as 
<BR>
utter lunacy.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;   And what about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;| market itself?  It was specifically Bill Gates who pushed us into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;| software marketing model that still prevails - where the software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;developer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;| gets a few pennies on the dollar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm not quite sure which developers you're talking about, but I am sure 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beside the point.  Microsoft's products help businesses succeed and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consumers consume, what more can you ask for?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
))))) How about products that work, keep working, and don't cost an arm and 
<BR>
a leg to purchase, and don't restrict you to their specific model of doing 
<BR>
things?  How about simple, clean interprocess communication as was available 
<BR>
on the Amiga with REXX.  How about multitasking for real?How about a file 
<BR>
manager that can remember from one instant to the next the format that you 
<BR>
ALWAYS want the files to be displayed in?  I could go on - for probably 
<BR>
several hundred pages just describing all the specific idiotic things in 
<BR>
Windose that were/are solved in real OS's.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;, while most of the money goes to marketing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;| and the end-buyer really has little clue as to product suitability or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;| reliability.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Man - have you really spent a lot of time in X-Windows?   Suitability?  for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the common Joe?  Come on.  I'd be suprised if you could install Linux on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;new box and have XFree86 running in less than 5 attempts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
So LINUX has an initial price, because of its UNIX heritage and the fact 
<BR>
that it highly optimizes to the specific machine and system environment.  So 
<BR>
you pay someone $50 or $100 to have LINUX installed with the common 
<BR>
applications you need.  How much does Windows cost up front?  How much is 
<BR>
your time over the next year worth, because you'll be losing a big chunk of 
<BR>
it to Windows crashes.  (How much does a typical Windows guru charge for HIS 
<BR>
time, BTW.) And what about that old Mac, anyway.  When I ask our service 
<BR>
bureau how many crashes so far with the new I-Macs, they tell me they're 
<BR>
still waiting for one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Read Steven Levy's &quot;Hackers.&quot;  We could have had a model more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;| like the LINUX - open-source, peer-reviewed system, where lousy software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;| caught before it ever made it to the shelf, and the money mostly goes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;| directly to the creators, and solid products cost a fraction of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;| equivalent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;|
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How very ideal - wake up man.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thank you for sharing that with us...  )))))
