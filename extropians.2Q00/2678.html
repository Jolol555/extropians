The
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; conflation of irrational with emotional and rational with unemotional,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sadly, has a longer history than Mr. Spock, extending back to the
</EM><BR>
Ancients,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but _Star Trek_ gave it a concrete portrayal that people confuse with
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; real thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Even though I agree with Eleizer, the problem should not be assigning
</EM><BR>
blame.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Instead, it's how to overcome the stereotype here and now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I prefer to look at Star Trek as an allegory in which the different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; characters are archetypes for aspects of humanity.  It is possible, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think Robert Anton Wilson has suggested, to view the principal Star
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Trek characters as emblems of various aspects of consciousness, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Enterprise itself serving as one of them.  Leary's eightfold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness model works decently here.  I should think this might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of particular interest to Eliezer with his thinking aboud &quot;domdules&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of consciousness.  Once you view Star Trek as a story about the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that human consciousness grapples with the unknown in a sort of silly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sci-fi allegory, it becomes a lot more fun, I think.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even if true, it's still stereotypical thinking.  I prefer characters that
<BR>
are more full, more realistic.  I still believe Eliezer right here -- the
<BR>
intelligent (and the rational) are projected in a one-sided way.  The reason
<BR>
they split people into characters like that is because deep down, too many
<BR>
accept the notion that reason and emotion are antagonistic and that human
<BR>
nature is basically split along those lines.  _Star Trek_ only reinforces a
<BR>
bad habit.  (Granted, it does not completely damn the series, but it is not
<BR>
something to be praised.)
<BR>
<P>I also prefer &quot;the unknown&quot; that is a bit more unknown and a lot less like
<BR>
finding more of the same in space.  (_Star Trek_'s alien races -- choose any
<BR>
series -- are a bit too much like humans from look to culture.  And the
<BR>
things the crews discover range from cliche to platitude.:)
<BR>
