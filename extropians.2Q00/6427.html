Joseph writes, quoting Venter and Cohen:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     We mean a parliament in the sense of a deliberative body of experienced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     scientists and philosophers, let us say of 60 or so members, rotating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     in two-year terms to advise decision-makers in business and politics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     with the weight of their collective authority. This body, perhaps under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     United Nations auspices, would inform the public of what is at stake in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     a given scientific advance and propose solutions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What do you think about this?  The rotation/term limits should encourage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flexibility but the obvious concern, aside from the general one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nonminimal intervention, is that such a body, while potentially able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fight certain real abuses, will prove conservative.  If the sign over the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; door says [Ye Olde House of Relinquishment] we're in trouble.
</EM><BR>
<P>Although the wording suggests otherwise, I think this is primarily
<BR>
intended to be a body which makes *moral* recommendations.  They aren't
<BR>
there to give technical advice.  This proposal appears in the part of
<BR>
the article where the authors are discussing moral issues.
<BR>
<P>I don't think it will be possible to find a group of people who have
<BR>
&quot;collective authority&quot; on upcoming moral issues, especially in the
<BR>
context of a world with incredible diversity of cultures.  Is it really
<BR>
plausible that the religious countries where women must go veiled and
<BR>
drug use leads to execution can agree with European countries where
<BR>
women go topless on the beach and drugs are freely available?
<BR>
<P>I also agree with Joseph that there may be an implication that these
<BR>
moral pronouncements will be given the force of law.  If they were just
<BR>
intended to guide individuals who voluntarily agreed with the wisdom of
<BR>
the recommendations, I'd have no problems whatsoever.  The more people
<BR>
thinking about the issues and giving advice, the better.  But in proposing
<BR>
to advise political and business leaders I think the idea is to remove
<BR>
some options from end users, to take away their freedom to make their
<BR>
own decisions.
