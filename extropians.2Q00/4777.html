<EM>&gt;Some people won't have read these for a while. I recommend taking a minute to

</EM><BR>
<P>Emlyn: First, thank you for your thoughtful comments on the Principles. I 
<BR>
found these latest thoughts much more stimulating that your claim that the 
<BR>
first principle is &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;modernist&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have a bone to pick about the first principle. I don't think that it adds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much that the other principles don't already say, and I think it is overly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;simplistic about &quot;progress&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sympathetic to what you're saying, though I don't entirely agree. I've 
<BR>
been gradually gathering notes for version 4.0 of the Principles, and some 
<BR>
kind of architectural revision is likely. You've certainly spotted 
<BR>
something that I had thought of, even if I don't go along with the idea of 
<BR>
ditching the first principle.
<BR>
<P>I take the essence of your constructive criticism to be that Principle 1 
<BR>
(Perpetual Improvement) is redundant since it is covered by the principles 
<BR>
of Self-Transformation (#2), Intelligent Technology (#4), and Open Society 
<BR>
(#5).
<BR>
<P>If you read the full text of the Principles, rather than the short version 
<BR>
that you quote, I think you will see that Perpetual Improvement has a scope 
<BR>
not identical to that of those other principles. I think you're insightful 
<BR>
in seeing the overlap. I see Perpetual Improvement as something of an 
<BR>
important &quot;metaprinciple&quot;, out of which you can draw some of the other 
<BR>
principles (though not completely without remainder). I would like version 
<BR>
4.0 to reflect that in some way, though I am not keen on the idea of a 
<BR>
hierarchical set of principles where I try to derive everything from one 
<BR>
master principle.
<BR>
<P>The Principles are a group of somewhat fuzzy sets that overlap, but where 
<BR>
some are more central than others. Perhaps the only way to convey this 
<BR>
effectively is through a graphical representation. Alternatively, for those 
<BR>
interested in the intellectual minutia, I could write an &quot;Explanatory 
<BR>
Comments on the Principle&quot; that explores the relationships between the 
<BR>
principles. I like the idea of a graphical representation that somehow 
<BR>
shows the links between principles. Once I'm ready, perhaps someone can 
<BR>
help me put this together in a Java applet?
<BR>
<P>Perpetually overcoming constraints on our progress and possibilities.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  - Why not just &quot;Perpetually overcoming constraints on our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self-actualisation and self-realization&quot;? Removes that dogmatic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;progressive&quot; tone.
</EM><BR>
<P>I still don't grok why you think this is dogmatic. Extropian thinking 
<BR>
certainly *is* about progress. The terms &quot;self-actualization&quot; and 
<BR>
&quot;self-realization&quot; will not do at all. What kind of self is to be realized 
<BR>
or actualized? The self-transformative aspects of Perpetual Progress are 
<BR>
compatible with a huge array of possible ways of self-actualizing, but not 
<BR>
with all. Actualizing a self who is excellent at viciously destructive 
<BR>
behavior is not obviously extropic. Nor is actualizing a self who 
<BR>
epitomizes complete and utter laziness or parasitic reliance on others. I 
<BR>
know, I know, you don't *mean* that. But the terms do not exclude those 
<BR>
possibilities. At least &quot;progress&quot; does imply something a bit more 
<BR>
specific. Yet the term is sufficiently unspecific and open to personal 
<BR>
interpretation that I do not see the sense or justice of calling it &quot;dogmatic&quot;.
