Ping is away from his email, though he should be back shortly.  (The
<BR>
announced return time was this week, but he may be buried in email.)  I
<BR>
don't know what address you should use for support on crit, and I haven't
<BR>
installed it anywhere myself.

<EM>&gt; I know it was down a few days ago. I'm not current with what is happening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now.The guy who invented Crit is Ka-Ping Yee, you may want to try emailing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at:primary email: <A HREF="mailto:ping@lfw.org?Subject=Re:%20What's%20up%20with%20Crit&In-Reply-To=&lt;3952FA58.2E80531A@netcom.com&gt;">ping@lfw.org</A> or secondary: <A HREF="mailto:ping@foresight.org?Subject=Re:%20What's%20up%20with%20Crit&In-Reply-To=&lt;3952FA58.2E80531A@netcom.com&gt;">ping@foresight.org</A>

<EM>&gt; &gt; Is there anybody out there who knows what's going on with Crit?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Their mailing list handler is bouncing my subscription requests,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and the links to the mailing list archives on www.crit.org are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all broken. Does anybody know what, if any, is the current address
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the Crit-help mailing list? Although, I'd settle for an email
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from somebody who's installed Crit in CGI mode so I could ask that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; person something that's probably a relatively simple question.
