Some finite number of Harvey Newstroms wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then I must clarify my goals.  I don't want some Harvey Newstromish person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to exist in the future.  I want *this* current Harvey Newstrom to continue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to exist and evolve into the future.  I do not want him destroyed and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replaced by a new Harvey Newstrom.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's an interesting goal to have.  However, I fear that it begs the
<BR>
question as to why you have it in the first place.
<BR>
<P>I happen to be willing to &quot;die&quot; (or whatever) so long as a pretty recent
<BR>
copy of me lives on.  (By pretty recent, I mean on the order of months,
<BR>
maybe a year under extreme circumstances.)
<BR>
<P>Why would a person be willing to do that?  Well, it's because the
<BR>
continued existence of this consciousness stream is not an intrinsic end
<BR>
of mine.  It is not an object which I pursue for its own sake: rather, I
<BR>
pursue it because it happens to be practically useful for the pursuit of
<BR>
other ends of mine.  Once this consciousness stream LOSES its unique
<BR>
status, once it is *no longer necessary* for the majority of my goals to
<BR>
be pursued, I have no further (special) use for this consciousness stream.
<BR>
*You* might say that I have no further (special) use for myself.
<BR>
<P>Why did you want to preserve your &quot;self&quot; (as such) in the first place? You
<BR>
could tell me a story about your intrinsic desires, which you might
<BR>
explain with a story about how you've evolved that way.  But, of course,
<BR>
our primitive desires have little to say about whether copy+destroy is
<BR>
death, or whether it's morally legitimate.  (In fact, to the extent that
<BR>
our &quot;evolved&quot; desires tell us anything at all, they tell us that it's our
<BR>
moral duty to die so that better equipped copies can live on: thus mothers
<BR>
are willing to go to death for their children, brothers and sisters die
<BR>
for one another, etc.  And they aren't even very close copies.)
<BR>
<P>Instead of a clear primitive idea as to what &quot;I&quot; am and what &quot;death&quot; is,
<BR>
if you're like me, your primitive desire is more like an imperative
<BR>
saying:  &quot;I must prevent myself from dying.&quot;  It doesn't tell me anything
<BR>
what &quot;myself&quot; is or what &quot;dying&quot; is; rather, it just says that whatever
<BR>
&quot;dying&quot; is, that's what I need to avoid having happen to &quot;me,&quot; whatever
<BR>
that turns out to be.
<BR>
<P>More to the point, if &quot;you&quot; turn out to be the program that's running on
<BR>
the fantastic machine that is your body, then shutting down a copy
<BR>
shouldn't be too big a problem.  If you happen to be your current
<BR>
consciousness stream, or control over it, or whatever, then destroying
<BR>
that is a pretty big deal as far as our primitive desires are concerned.
<BR>
<P>I take it as axiomatic that our goals, our ends, are what we are striving
<BR>
for; that the correct goals/ends are the correct things to strive for.
<BR>
With that in mind, do we have it as a goal to preserve our current
<BR>
consciousness stream?
<BR>
<P>As far as I can tell, the answer is no.  My lizard brain has nothing to
<BR>
say about whether I'm an adjective, as John Clark has been known to put
<BR>
it, or a noun, as you might have it.  My intuitions just tell me to
<BR>
preserve &quot;myself,&quot; and to avoid &quot;death.&quot;
<BR>
<P>In light of that, and in light of my other goals, it seems to me like it
<BR>
might be most efficacious to choose the definitions of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;death&quot;
<BR>
under which I'm best able to accomplish my goals.  Now, only *I* have
<BR>
special knowledge of my own goals, and therefore *I* am in a unique
<BR>
position to pursue them.  But as far as I can tell, the most useful
<BR>
definition (from the point of view of my goals) is the &quot;adjectival&quot; view.
<BR>
Reflexive consciousness streams are hard to maintain.  Processes can be
<BR>
backed up, copied, and even expended if it serves a greater goal.  So long
<BR>
as the copy is pretty recent, it should share most of my beliefs and most
<BR>
of my goals/ends for which I'm willing to stunt a consciousness stream.
<BR>
And I've certainly got a few; maybe you do too.
<BR>
<P>You might try to insist that it's INTRINSICALLY important that I preserve
<BR>
myself.  But does that mean that I can't slice my own throat if a copy
<BR>
lives on?  No, because that &quot;intrinsic&quot; view is just the primative
<BR>
imperative I described earlier, with extra oomph.  It says I'm
<BR>
intrinsically important, but doesn't tell me whether I'm the way I behave
<BR>
or the ends I pursue or the beliefs I have or my own consciousness streams
<BR>
or what.
<BR>
<P>Of course, the lizard brain DOES have something to say about, for example,
<BR>
puncturing this body... but in my more rational moments I normally take it
<BR>
that this is only extrinsically useful; that some things are worth blood
<BR>
sweat and tears in order to get them.
<BR>
<P>So why should I care about consciousness streams?  What sort of goals ARE
<BR>
you pursuing that makes it a good idea to decide that &quot;avoiding your own
<BR>
death&quot; means &quot;maintaining control over this very consciousness stream&quot;?
<BR>
For they seem to be drastically different from mine.
