<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt;#2 would be the strongest, except that I've only seen it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;exemplified occasionally. About #1: there's a long literature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about the anti-Semitic implications of irrational circumcision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;discussions.
</EM><BR>
<P>I must have missed this gem the first time.  I mouth off about
<BR>
circumcision, so Extropians are anti-Semitic.  That's a bit of a
<BR>
stretch for two reasons.  First, while I disparage most religions,
<BR>
about the only two I have some respect for are Zen and Judaism,
<BR>
both of which have some interesting practical ideas mixed with
<BR>
the dogma.  And of course even if I had no respect for the
<BR>
religion at all, that implies nothing about my opinions of
<BR>
Israel as a people, race, or culture.  I may also have some
<BR>
objections to the actions of the government of the country of
<BR>
Israel, but no more than I have against my own government.
<BR>
<P>Secondly, it's even more of a stretch to think I represent
<BR>
Extropianism in any large sense.  Hell, I wasn't even a member
<BR>
until it became a requirement to get into Extro 4.  My rants
<BR>
are purely a product of my own warped mind, and solely for my
<BR>
own purposes (as is everything--I am a radical egoist after
<BR>
all) and should not necessarily reflect upon the group, many
<BR>
of whom just barely tolerate me.
<BR>
<P>Yes, I oppose circumcision strongly, and will continue to.
