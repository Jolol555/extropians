<EM>&gt; &gt;How can we watch what we say and still have a frank discussion about the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I find this thread mind-boggling. People like Corey and Anders are simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointing out that couching our aspirations as *rape*, however
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; metaphorically, is distasteful at best and wildly self-destructive at worst.

<EM>&gt; We're going to have enough foes. Let's not gratuitously and foolishly

<EM>&gt; provide them with the stick to beat us.

<P>Ok, I inadvertently started this mess, let me try to make excuses, er,

clarify things.  I originally wrote in reply to Spike,

<P>You could try, but the Outer Space treaty prohibits extraterrestrial
<BR>
claims, and signatory nations would not recognize such claims.  Bottom
<BR>
line is, you'd have to be ready to survive an embargo.  Conversely, it's
<BR>
a great big commons that you're free to rape- materials extracted would
<BR>
be yours, ya just can't claim real estate.  When the time comes, this
<BR>
treaty could be renegotiated or abrogated, of course.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<P>I phrased this poorly, to put it mildly.  What I was struggling to say
<BR>
was that resources without a clear owner invite a tragedy of the
<BR>
commons, since no one entity is responsible for, well, *responsible*
<BR>
use.  I feel that criticism of the unnecessarily inflammatory nature of
<BR>
my post is justified, because it comes across as being very callous
<BR>
about waste and damage... very entropic things when you consider it.  We
<BR>
have enough of an uphill struggle as it is.
<BR>
<P>Precision in speech &amp; writing, and avoidance of gratuitous shock value,
<BR>
seems to me to be useful.
