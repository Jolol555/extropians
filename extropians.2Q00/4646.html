<EM>&gt; &gt; As an anarcho-capitalist, objectivist libertarian from the '60's on, it

<EM>&gt; &gt; pains me deeply to actually find myself even close to the same side of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; things as Janet Baby-killer Reno, but the fact is that if you were 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; aware of how badly the market has been served by the MS mob, and why, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hopefully would never have made such silly remarks.  MS, to me, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;represents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the triumph of a fundamentally idealess moneyed yuppy oligarchy in using 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; corrupt system to sell amazingly shoddy products to an ignorant market.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they didn't even invent that!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If your analysis is correct, the very concept of anarcho-capitalism is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fundamentally flawed. Any society based on personal freedom must be built 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the presumption that individuals are largely capable of making their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decisions, and that leaving them free to do so is the best available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;approach to running an economy. If, OTOH, individuals are fools and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;informed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experts can make better decisions than the markets, then the technocratic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;socialists are right to demand control of the economy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;One of the hard parts of advocating freedom is realizing that you,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personally, are not exempt from the arguments we have long advanced against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the centralization of authority. If a panel of experts can't be trusted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decide which product we should all use, neither can a panel of one. If a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;free market makes a decision you think is stupid, odds are that you are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one who is wrong. At the very least, you should assume that the result is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;due to differences in individual desires, needs, abilities and/or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information, rather than some kind of sinister plot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Claims that the &quot;wrong&quot; product has won out in a free market are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;commonplace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;among supporters of the products that lost, but they almost invariably turn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out to be incorrect.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Let the market decide?&quot;  Gawd, I hate to think of all the times that I've 
<BR>
heard that used by anarcho-capitalists or limited-crime libertarians to shut 
<BR>
down an argument.  What if Henry Ford had listened to one of them?
<BR>
<P>Who is this &quot;market?&quot;  Is it some creature like the &quot;monster from the id?&quot;  
<BR>
Techno-magically hypostacized into a ubiquitous all-knowing uber-soul?  What 
<BR>
about bustles?  What about women's fashions in general?  (or men's - as if.) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tailfins?
<BR>
<P>The fact is that markets are hardly the efficient calculators of marginal 
<BR>
return that ivory-tower agorist theory would have.  Humans have an ENORMOUS 
<BR>
overcapacity for survival.  Throughout most of history most humans have 
<BR>
worked 3 or 4 hours per day and played or fought the rest of their waking 
<BR>
hours.  This hasn't changed in the &quot;modern&quot; corporate environment.  Most 
<BR>
companies that I've looked at function with huge profit margins which they 
<BR>
then fritter away or waste through idiotic management and internal politics.
<BR>
<P>The problem with the situations under discussion is two-fold.  First, 
<BR>
accurate information about highly technical new subjects is always likely to 
<BR>
be expensive.  Without a track record, how does the layman or non-technical 
<BR>
educator, bureaucrat or manager judge who is an expert?  They look to brand 
<BR>
as an indicator.  They look to what everyone else is buying.  They ask their 
<BR>
friends.  If they're a middle manager, or typical purchasing bureaurat in a 
<BR>
state function, then it's much more critical not to make a mistake than to 
<BR>
do the best thing.
<BR>
<P>Thus, as I have pointed out, it was the state institutions that bought Apple 
<BR>
II's, by and large, financing a self-perpetuating Apple snowball as they 
<BR>
cultivated the erroneous image of being &quot;the educational computer.&quot;  This 
<BR>
hardly reflects a &quot;free market&quot; choice, so it really doesn't even bear upon 
<BR>
your objection.  When we look at the initial success of the IBM PC, we see 
<BR>
more irrational - specifically chaotic - factors entering the picture.  The 
<BR>
PC was not nearly as good as many other machines on the market.  
<BR>
Furthermore, MS-DOS was a really weak OS, actually scaled down from the 
<BR>
superior CP/M, which already had a fairly mature market and a good track 
<BR>
record among the early adopter businesses.  The ONE thing that the PC had 
<BR>
was the brand - IBM.
<BR>
<P>The brand made it safe for managers - and again, especially purchasing 
<BR>
bureaucrats, and most especially STATE purchasing bureaucrats - to jump in.  
<BR>
IBM even used the slogan &quot;nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM.&quot;
<BR>
As in positive feedback systems in general, it is a very tiny distance from 
<BR>
control to runaway feedback and Mandelbrot economics.  If you're waiting for 
<BR>
safety in numbers to jump in and that's a major decision factor, then you 
<BR>
can expect long periods of nothing bordering sudden explosions - often only 
<BR>
reflecting a minor change in perception resulting, for example, from clever 
<BR>
marketing aimed at that block of buyers.
<BR>
<P>Then there is the factor of institutional control on the production side - 
<BR>
especially via the FDIC banking cartel.  As I read it, they took over Atari 
<BR>
because Bushnell was too risky - and put a VP from Warner's movie division 
<BR>
in charge.  They got rid of the Woz, then Jobs, and put in a soft-drink 
<BR>
salesman.  They put a banker directly in charge of Commodore.  In all three 
<BR>
cases, these moves virtually destroyed the company in the long run.  But the 
<BR>
reality is that profits are not the bottom line for these people.
<BR>
<P>Control is where it's at.  If you can CONTROL a company, you can send its 
<BR>
share prices up or down at will.  And then your buddies who control other 
<BR>
companies can get the word a little early and make enormous profits either 
<BR>
going up or down.  Of course they might drop a few hints your way every now 
<BR>
and then as well.
<BR>
<P>There are stupid markets fleeced by mega-scale con artists.  Purchasing 
<BR>
decisions in these markets are made by people who have no real life and 
<BR>
death stake in doing the best thing - just the &quot;safe&quot; thing - that for which 
<BR>
they can't be blamed.  Then there are smart markets driven by people who 
<BR>
actually personally depend upon making accurate purchases.
<BR>
<P>For example, the overwhelming majority of private users and schools who 
<BR>
bought C64s instead of Apple II's.  Or the scientists and cutting edge 
<BR>
scientific research institutions who bought Amigas in bulk - eg., Livermore 
<BR>
Labs.  Or the TV post-production or CG people, such as Foundation Imaging or 
<BR>
DreamWorks that jumped ship from SGI to the Amiga/Lightwave/Toaster package. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the desktop publishing, print graphics community, which is still 
<BR>
solidly Mac - NOT PC!
<BR>
<P>Or, what about LINUX?  The LINUX people have been saying the same sorts of 
<BR>
things that I have for years now.  And they're finally winning a major 
<BR>
market share as purchasers move up the learning curve.  BeOS is another 
<BR>
example.  It probably outclasses everything else out there as a personal 
<BR>
computer OS.  But the Apple controllers cancelled the deal at the last 
<BR>
moment, because they couldn't control Gasse.  He was too good and wanted too 
<BR>
much control himself.  (BeOS may make it yet, however, under its own power.)
<BR>
<P>There are a host of additional mistakes involved in your position - more 
<BR>
than I can possibly cover here.  Simply letting people make choices does not 
<BR>
make for an efficient or intelligent market.  (Gold went to over $900 around 
<BR>
1979, then dropped to $600, then to $400, all in a matter of months.  Which 
<BR>
of these markets was right?)
<BR>
<P>The answer to these problems is not the state, however.  In fact, often you 
<BR>
find that the distortions of judgement involved in mass market decisions 
<BR>
reflects a market already distorted by state intervention - as in the 
<BR>
banking cartel, or the artificial advantages and immunities that 
<BR>
corporations - creatures of the state - receive.
