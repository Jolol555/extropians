<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Koestler wrote about the DNA code being taped over - as with a piano 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; certain keys taped over - such that only certain potentialities are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; expressed.  As cells age, however, they tend to drift back toward a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; general expression - to become less differentiated, as the &quot;tape&quot; comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; loose at random points, until they conclude that somehow they are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; fulfilling their mission - or the demented version of it that now is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; controlling goal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;This is Cutler's dysdifferentiation theory (which seems to have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;developed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;circa 1985).  It sounds like Koestler is recycling it (do you have a ref.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for that?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Koestler argued that back in 1964 (!) in his wonderful cross-disciplinary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;book THE ACT OF CREATION. (Recent editions seem to have deleted the second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;half where he advanced ideas about biology and cognitive psychology that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are now either commonplace and much more developed, or somewhat antiquated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or even quite dippy.) He was much influenced by Waddington and Bateson.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;[And I, for what it's worth, was much influenced by him, having bought his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;book the moment it came out, yum yum.]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>Ah,  Thank you.  Yes, agreed, some of his ideas - like the others I cited in 
<BR>
my previous email today - were dippy.  Some people are like the old 
<BR>
regenerative radio receivers, I suspect.  They feed the ideas back in upon 
<BR>
themselves and often push them to the absolute limit of signal, looking for 
<BR>
coherence.  Often this works.  When you push it too far, however, you get 
<BR>
that same old distortion or even a coherent feedback squeal that only 
<BR>
reflects the inherent harmonics of the receiving system.  The signal is 
<BR>
totally lost.  It did and does work pretty well up to that limit.  All the 
<BR>
crew I cited - Pirsig, Rand, Fuller - etc., were notorious for going off the 
<BR>
deep end at times, oblivious to how silly they appeared.  But in order to 
<BR>
find that optimum, when all you have to go on is turning the dial up and 
<BR>
down, you have to accept an occasional feedback problem.  If you're 
<BR>
extremely intelligent and self-aware, you can catch it and back down, 
<BR>
usually...
<BR>
<P>This relates to another, deeper epistemological problem actually, which is 
<BR>
discussed at length in &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.&quot;  In a 
<BR>
nutshell: We might have the illusion that we control our thoughts, but the 
<BR>
question then arises, &quot;who is doing the controlling?&quot;  If it is something 
<BR>
outside our thoughts, then how is it even knowable, or predictable?  If it 
<BR>
is somehow our thoughts themselves, the stream of consciousness controlling 
<BR>
itself, then how can this be possible without self-referential nonsense?  
<BR>
(This could be phrased better, as I'm typing as usual off the top of my 
<BR>
head, but you probably get the idea.)
