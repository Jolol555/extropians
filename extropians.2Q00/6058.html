<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; The best defense against this is to make sure the mainstream of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; discussion is held in a polite and understandable manner, to create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; clear principles that can help people understand that the extremist is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; just that, and overall try to gain a good reputation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Anders, *you have* a good reputation, and I am honored to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;associated with you.  I dont recall ever seeing an unkind word from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you or even a micoflame, even against those who richly deserve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it.  {8-]  However there are posters to this list that I hope I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;never associated with, (and they surely feel likewise about me)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and I have no control over what they post.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There are many cases where we quote a previous post then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;refute that stated viewpoint.  Any debate opponent doing a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;keyword search would get hits with someone else's quote with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;our name on it.  If they wanted, they could delete out our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;comment and quote someone elses words under our name.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think Anders has crystallized the direction of behavior is an aptly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;positive light, but it's often easier to write down the words than to deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;head on with an adverse poster.  If Anders had to defend his reputation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how would he do it?  For example, if Anders was told something very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unbecoming about himself or his family, I don't even want to imagine, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something that could humiliate or hurt him professionally, would he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;continue politely to respond when the flamer wouldn't let up.  Or, would he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;walk away knowing that he did the best he could under the circumstances,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and better judgment told him to ignore the flamer.  I would never want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Anders to experience such a thing, but it does build character -:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, Anders has already been attacked in the Swedish media some 
<BR>
months ago. In one of Sweden's biggest newspapers (well, that's a too polite 
<BR>
term, Expressen is a boulevard press rag) he was attacked as the science 
<BR>
editor of the magazine m2. But it wasn't a very powerful attack, and I think 
<BR>
that Anders has a bit to much credibility to be seriously harmed by it.
<BR>
<P>About all this nonsense of extropians being anti- semitic?
<BR>
Well, unfortunately it is a very good way for someone without any 
<BR>
credibility of his own to quickly gain some pointers from the PC- 
<BR>
establishment, especially when he's accusing a small group that is not well 
<BR>
known. A possible counter strategy: first value the opponent. If your 
<BR>
credibility is higher you can usually just ignore them, entering a war with 
<BR>
kooks just gives the kooks status. If it is worth bothering with you can 
<BR>
start to scrutinize the character of the opposition- and from the forums 
<BR>
which said person often frequents you can usually find some juicy tidbits 
<BR>
that will probably put him in the same &quot;Nazi&quot; cathegory. Those that accuse 
<BR>
out of desperation that their ideas are not heard often have a dirty laundry 
<BR>
themselves...
<BR>
That makes your sensible defense all the more powerful.
<BR>
<P>Transhumanism is starting to get more and more into the mainstream. That is 
<BR>
important, because then &quot;kook- attacks&quot; are less and less dangerous. But the 
<BR>
way to get into the mainstream is through being more serious and 
<BR>
ideologically aware. Transhumanism has to grow up a bit more, and I think 
<BR>
that there should be perhaps a change of some organisational structures to 
<BR>
encourage it further.
<BR>
<P>I don't know what personal reasons there might have been for this feud, but 
<BR>
my opinion after reading the thread is that some very unfair accusations 
<BR>
have been made about Max, Natasha and extropianism.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
<P>Waldemar
