<EM>&gt;No, the article didn't say anything more about Drexler.  In fact my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;perception is that the whole field is doing its best to pretend that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he doesn't exist.  I predict that the Foresight conference will soon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no longer be the premier nanotech conference.  The real academics will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want to disassociate themself from the nanofanatics and set up a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;respectable venue.  (Maybe this has happened already; I don't follow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the research.)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;Academics have pretty clearly decided that the Foresight technical
<BR>
conferences are respectable. At the recent Alcor conference, I heard
<BR>
Ralph Merkle mention that people who are invited to Foresight conferences
<BR>
these days are almost always eager to accept, and those that decline
<BR>
invitations always seem to have legitimate scheduling conflicts.
<BR>
&nbsp;To the extent the academics have disassociated themselves from Drexlerian
<BR>
ideas, it has been by simply ignoring Foresight's interest in them. This
<BR>
has been made easier by Drexler's increasing aversion to large meetings.
<BR>
At last year's Foresight conference, the far-out ideas were only discussed
<BR>
in private conversations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I can't help thinking that a core problem is cryonics.  Cryonicists have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been hoping that nanotech will give them respectability for 15 years now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In fact, the opposite seems to have happened.  Cryonics is so disreputable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for most people, so firmly entrenched in the nonsense/fraud category,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the least association with the practice is enough to discredit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any activity.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;While taking current cryonics practices seriously is still unpopular,
<BR>
I don't see any signs that this stigma is rubbing off on associated
<BR>
practices. For instance, Greg Fahy used to avoid any public association
<BR>
with cryonics. He now speaks at Alcor conferences. He still criticizes
<BR>
Drexler's optimism, but that's about all he does to distinguish himself
<BR>
from other cryonicists.
