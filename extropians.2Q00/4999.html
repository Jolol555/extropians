-----Original Message-----
<BR>
From: altamira
<BR>
<P>I'd like to see more on this topic.  I've been living this way for a few
<BR>
years now and have never been happier.  It's not that I wouldn't like to
<BR>
have more money--
<BR>
<P>I kinda live that way....
<BR>
<P>I live in an eight by six &quot;box&quot;....only I'm mobile....(very mobile)....
<BR>
<P>I have a few more stresses possibly than some...but on the whole I &quot;leave my
<BR>
problems behind me&quot;.....
<BR>
<P>Dunno about low tech though....I like hi tech....
<BR>
