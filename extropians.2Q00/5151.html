&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology First Aimed At Heavens Now Makes &quot;Super&quot; Human Vision
<BR>
Possible 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adapting technology originally developed by astronomers to obtain
<BR>
better 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;images of the heavens, a University of Rochester scientist has
<BR>
developed 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an optical system that has given research subjects an unprecedented 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quality of eyesight. The research dramatically improves the sight even
<BR>
of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people who have 20/20 vision. Vision scientist David Williams
<BR>
presented 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his work this week at the summer meeting of the American Astronomical 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Society in Rochester, N.Y. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the work is still in a research stage, eye-care giant Bausch &amp;
<BR>
Lomb 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has licensed the technology and is working with University researchers
<BR>
to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commercialize it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For years David has been way out in front exploring how we could
<BR>
enhance 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people's vision beyond what is normally thought of as perfect vision,&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says Scott MacRae, one of the world's leading cornea specialists and a
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;widely recognized pioneer in refractive surgery. MacRae is moving to
<BR>
the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University's Medical Center this month to join Williams at the newly 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;established Alliance for Vision Excellence, a new collaboration
<BR>
between 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the University and Bausch &amp; Lomb that is dedicated to improving
<BR>
technology 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to correct vision-impairing anomalies of the eye. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the old days,&quot; says MacRae, &quot;we were just trying to correct
<BR>
people's 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vision problems and treat disease. This new research takes what we 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider normal vision and enhances it. This is truly revolutionary,&quot;
<BR>
says 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MacRae, who is writing a book on such research, which he calls &quot;the
<BR>
quest 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for super vision.&quot; Just last month at the annual meeting of the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, researchers from
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several laboratories and companies devoted a whole symposium to the
<BR>
topic 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of enhanced vision. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams uses technology known as adaptive optics, which was
<BR>
originally 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developed by astronomers to sharpen images from telescopes by
<BR>
correcting 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for aberrations in the atmosphere. Adaptive optics have been
<BR>
implemented 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on several telescopes, including the giant Keck Telescope in Hawaii, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resulting in remarkably crisp images. Williams, who is Allyn Professor
<BR>
of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical Optics and director of the University's Center for Visual
<BR>
Science, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has led a decade-long effort to apply the technology to improve
<BR>
ordinary 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human vision. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His researchers direct a harmless, highly focused spot of light into
<BR>
the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eye of a research subject and measure the light that is reflected
<BR>
outward. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That light provides a glimpse or snapshot of the topography of the eye
<BR>
in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exquisite detail. The light is broken up into 217 laser beams that are
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent into a sophisticated device known as a wavefront sensor. The
<BR>
sensor 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analyzes deviations in each beam's path, revealing tiny imperfections
<BR>
or 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aberrations that exist in the person's cornea and lens. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system detects visual distortions so subtle that physicians didn't
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even know they existed until Williams' laboratory invented the system.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today a visit to the eye doctor focuses mainly on two types of
<BR>
aberration: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;astigmatism and defocus. Most prescriptions are intended to correct
<BR>
for 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these two defects. Williams' system can measure up to 65 different 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aberrations. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These precise measurements are sent to a sensitive &quot;deformable&quot; mirror
<BR>
<PRE>
-- 
      a mirror that can bend and customize its shape according to the 
      measurements of a person's eye. Such flexible mirrors form the heart
of 
      traditional adaptive-optics systems used in astronomy. The mirror in 
      Williams' laboratory is a two-inch-wide device that bends as little as
one 
      or two micrometers (just one-fiftieth the width of a human hair)
thanks to 
      37 tiny computer-controlled pistons. This subtle shaping, done in
response 
      to the customized measurements of a person's optical system, alters
the 
      light in such a way that it exactly counters the specific distortions
in a 
      person's eye. 
      In the laboratory, Williams' team has shown that correcting these 
      imperfections can result in greatly improved vision. He has published
this 
      work in the Journal of the Optical Society of America. 
      &quot;When you look through an adaptive optics device, the world looks 
      crisper,&quot; Williams says. &quot;In some people, the ability to pick up
contrast, 
      such as minute patterns of stripes, is increased by a factor of six.
It 
      allows for a level of vision correction that's just not available
today. 
      &quot;It's like needing glasses and getting them for the first time.
Everything 
      suddenly looks sharper and clearer, no matter how good your eyes are 
      normally. When you're using the adaptive optics system, you just say 
      'wow.' &quot; 
      Williams is an expert on the circuitry of the human retina and the
optics 
      of the eye. After discovering some of the basic limits of the optical 
      system of the human eye, he began exploring ways to improve ordinary
human 
      vision, eventually working closely with astronomers and other 
      adaptive-optics experts. The research is now funded by the National 
      Science Foundation Center for Adaptive Optics (based at the University
of 
      California, Santa Cruz), the National Eye Institute, and Bausch &amp;
Lomb. 
      Williams has found that the visual acuity of the human eye can be 
      somewhere around 20/10. While adaptive optics may someday help
patients 
      approach that level, he says that acuity isn't the most noticeable 
      improvement. Adaptive optics improves eyesight most under low-light 
      conditions, such as night-time driving. MacRae, the laser surgery
expert, 
      estimates that a driver sharing the road with a bicyclist at dusk
could 
      see the bicyclist from roughly twice as far away if he or she were 
      equipped with adaptive optics correction. 
      In the past, Williams has used the system to look into the eye. In a 
      series of papers in such journals as Nature, Williams' team has
published 
      the best images ever obtained of the living human retina. Last year
the 
      team was able to differentiate the three types of cones in the living 
      human retina. Detailed information of the eye is helpful to 
      ophthalmologists monitoring patients with diseases like age-related 
      macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. 
      While the current set-up is too bulky to bring the experience of
enhanced 
      vision or super vision to many patients, MacRae is confident that that
day 
      is not too far off. 
      &quot;Someday you may no longer have to sit and answer patiently when
you're 
      asked repeatedly whether lens No. 1 or lens No. 2 is better,&quot; MacRae
says. 
      &quot;Someday you may just look into a wavefront sensor as David has
developed, 
      and in one quick second we'll have all the information needed to
improve 
      someone's vision dramatically.&quot;
