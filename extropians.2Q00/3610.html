<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ahem: if we play this game, I'll have to cite the CIA's fun activities

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the 1960's and 1970's. Or Oliver North's little escapades. Clue: the

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; do with the Irish issue and everything to do with militant animal rights

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; protestors blowing up meat packing warehouses.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ollie and the CIA never, to my knowledge killed anyone, up until the present
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; administration, who was an american citizen, with the sole exception of a few americans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; who were assisting communist insurgents in central America, and they got offed by CIA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; clients, not by the CIA itself. By definition, foreign communist geurillas are open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; season. Nobody in the White House ever ordered anyone to off an American, a market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; contrast to the practices of the Intelligence Section over there...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought you were a libertarian, Mike. Where is all this defensive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hyperpatriotism coming from? The CIA is allowed to off communist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insurgents by way of its clients, but the British government (a US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; client state) isn't allowed to off its own communist insurgents (the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; avowedly-Marxist pIRA) because they don't have the holy indulgence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the US state department?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>As I said, we haven't offed Marxists here since Julius and Ethel
<BR>
Rosenberg. American Marxists are free to live. I'm not being patriotic,
<BR>
I'm being anti-communist. There is a difference.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; People are human beings, Michael, whether or not they're citizens of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the United States. Either you concede that governments -- your own or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others -- have the right to kill them, or you don't. Personally, I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think state violence is a good thing under _any_ circumstances; there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may be mitigating conditions (such as, it's intended to prevent worse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violence -- i.e., self-defense), but that still doesn't make it _good_.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact, advocacy of state violence strikes me as being downright
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; un-extropian. (Snark, snark.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't advocate it. I encourage commie hunting by anyone who wants to
<BR>
participate. It should be open season as far as I'm concerned. Why
<BR>
should government get all the fun?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &amp;28,000 equals, at a current exchange rate of 1 to 1.48, an income of $41,440.00.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Assuming you are single, you have an initial deduction of $5700.00. Thus your taxable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; income is $35,740.00. With no other deductions or writoffs, your tax would be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; following:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wrong. That's the tax I pay on income _above_ 28K. On income _below_ 28K
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rate is 25%. There's a marginal rate of 10% on the first couple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousand, and a tax-free allowance of about 4.8K. On that first $41,440
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of income (US figures) I pay roughly $7000 in tax (don't have the UK IR
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tables to hand, can't be arsed calculating 'em by hand); this compares with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the $8200 you'd pay, if single, in the US, going by the IRS table you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cited.
</EM><BR>
<P>I already posted the amounts I'd pay, which are decidely lower than your
<BR>
claims. I notice you snipped those amounts from the post to hide this
<BR>
fact. That is dishonest.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why are you so convinced that the USA is automatically and in every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way better than anywhere else on the planet? It's just another goddamn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; country, and the rest of us don't all live in holes in the ground,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subsisting off hand-outs and cast-offs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (If the USA was a substantially better place to live -- combination of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money, standard of living, and all the rest -- I'd emigrate; I speak
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the language, I've got highly employable skills, and unlike you I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not incredibly attached to my country. But as far as I can calculate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the degree to which my life would improve is highly questionable, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd lose a fair bit, too. Some of us _like_ having five weeks a year of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paid vacation -- never mind sick leave -- as normal working conditions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and not having to worry about medical insurance or burglars with guns.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I take as much or as little vacation as I want. I'm not incredibly
<BR>
attached to my country, and I resent your accusations of my being
<BR>
hyperpatriotic. If I found a country that was more free than living here
<BR>
in New Hampshire, I'd move in a minute. (and as previously stated, we
<BR>
have five times fewer burglars than you do... how bout that?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        :
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; These days, the UK is approximately 7% non-white. Yeah, that's lilly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; white compared to the US. It is, however, a major departure from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; historical record.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; True. I have asserted that the relatively low homicide rates over there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; specifically because you don't have anywhere near the number of minorities as we do, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; most homicide is minority on minority crime here. Its got nothing to do with guns,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; while the lack of guns is specifically why your property crime rate is so high...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fairly predictably, the lack of firearms hasn't stopped gangsters getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their hands on them; there's a really nasty little turf war between a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bunch of thugs from Manchester and their neighbours in Leeds right now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (kneecappings, bodies found in car boots, that sort of thing).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, among petty criminals the issue is different. Anyone who goes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; housebreaking in the US is by definition fearless, and probably armed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -- they know what they're likely to get. (This makes tackling a burglar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extremely dangerous, but on the other hand, your chances of being burgled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are relatively low.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The perpetrators of burglary in the UK are different, because the risk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is lower. You get opportunist criminals (teenagers and drug users) who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try to sneak through a window and steal a VCR or a handbag. If confronted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they will run like hell and not fight back. Even if they're caught, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; severity of punishment will depend on whether they threatened the home-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; owner -- armed robbery can land you a life sentence, whereas housebreaking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't (unless you turn it into armed robbery by waving a gun around at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the almost-certainly-unarmed occupants).
</EM><BR>
<P>Most burglars are of that sort here as well, and they are typically
<BR>
minorities burgling other minorities in minority neighborhoods. So long
<BR>
as you don't mind living in communities with few minorities, your
<BR>
chances of being criminalized are extremely low, less even, than the UK.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What this means is, comparison of burglary rates between the USA and UK
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are damn near invalidated because of the different conditions that apply.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why? Because they actually look worse for you, so you have to dismiss
<BR>
them?
