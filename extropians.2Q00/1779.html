<P>&quot;Heart pump revives 'desperately ill' woman&quot;
<P>By LEIGH HOPPER 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Medical Writer 
<P><P>A dying woman implanted with a revolutionary,
miniature heart pump 16 days ago is walking and was
able to attend an Easter church service, a Texas Heart
Institute doctor said Tuesday. 
<P>&quot;She was desperately ill and now she isn't,&quot; said Dr.
O.H. Frazier, chief of cardiopulmonary
transplantation, who performed the operation April 10.
&quot;She's out of bed and walking around for the first
time in a month.&quot; 
<P>The woman, whose enlarged heart was failing despite
other support measures, is the second patient to be
implanted with the Jarvik 2000, a tiny turbine that
fits directly inside the heart's left ventricle. The
pump, the size of a C battery, pushes oxygenated blood
throughout the body. 
<P>The first patient implanted with a Jarvik 2000
received the device in December at the Texas Heart
Institute under medical emergency conditions,
according to the March-April edition of the American
Society for Artificial Internal Organs Journal. 
<P>The procedure was performed to replace a traditional
assist pump called a HeartMate which had become
infected. The patient, a boy, died after 16 days on
the Jarvik 2000 of the infection and multiple organ
failure. 
<P>Frazier described the procedure as a &quot;last-ditch
attempt&quot; that had a slim chance of success. 
<P>&quot;I saw no hope other than use of this technology. I
was very skeptical as far as hope of him surviving,&quot;
Frazier said. &quot;He had these other overwhelming
problems we were never able to reverse.&quot; 
<P>The woman implanted with the pump April 10 is the
first patient enrolled in a study to evaluate the pump
as a bridge to transplant, Frazier said. She remains
on the waiting list for a donor heart. So far, the
battery-powered device &quot;is performing extremely well,&quot;
Frazier said, and he is &quot;very optimistic of her
chances of being successfully transplanted.&quot; 
<P>Texas Heart Institute expects to implant the device,
which was developed by Frazier and New York doctor
Robert Jarvik, in a small number of patients in the
coming months. The Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital is the only site of the pilot
study, which was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. 
<P>Eligible patients are those who are &quot;absolutely too
small&quot; for the more widely used HeartMate assist pump,
Frazier said. A typical HeartMate patient might be 5
feet, 9 inches tall, and weigh about 175 pounds, he
said. Women and children usually have bodies too small
to be fitted with the larger device. 
<P>The Jarvik 2000 has been designed for long-term use,
and the mini-pump pioneers hope it could someday be
used as a permanent alternative to heart transplants.
In addition, patients with artificial devices could
avoid the anti-rejection drugs that transplant
patients must take. 
<P>Frazier said the pump's power is imperceptible to the
patient. 
<P>&quot;It's what Dr. Jarvik and I always wanted to achieve,
a pump that's forgettable,&quot; Frazier said. &quot;This one,
she doesn't even know it's present.&quot; 
<P>---
<P>Onward,
