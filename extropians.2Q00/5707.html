<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly I don't find immigration laws to be inhumane.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why are they a bad idea?...

<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm surprized at you, Michael.  Open borders are a bedrock of the free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; market economy, and a simple consequence of granting the same basic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rights of free travel and association to those born on one side of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; imaginary line as we do to those born on the other.  Nationalism is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unbecoming rational minds.  &quot;Excessive people&quot; are a resource to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cherished, not a burden.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't look at it as a nationalist issue, its an economic AND ecological 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Open borders for TRADE are a bedrock of a free market economy. The existing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;members of a free market economy should also have the ability to control 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quality of life in their communities. If people living elsewhere want a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quality of life like we do, then they should work to recreate our success 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they are at. Part of that is re-engineering their society. Societies that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;produce more people than can be sustained on their resources not only 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;degrade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their own quality of life, by exporting the results of their bad social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reproduction policies to our countries, they not only perpetuate a dumb 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where they are at, but they export people who will perpetuate those same 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dumb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ideas elsewhere.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am shocked by this being said by an American. If some nation in the world 
<BR>
is the proof of you being wrong it is the US! Immigrants are not unskilled 
<BR>
or uneducated. A ticket to the US is EXTREMELY expensive in most poorer 
<BR>
countries. Face it, you're receiving the elite of these countries, for free. 
<BR>
You get already trained people that are willing to work and work hard. You 
<BR>
also negate the concept of economic growth. And besides, the MORAL aspect. I 
<BR>
have the right to live where I damned well please, as long as I don't mooch 
<BR>
on other people. Really, immigration policy should be one of transhumanism's 
<BR>
more important issues. If we want dynamism, new ideas, new possibilities in 
<BR>
our cultures- we should fight for a free immigration policy.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I see this all the time, with flatlanders moving up here to the sticks. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;THey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want the high quality of life that we have living up here, but once they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;here they go about trying to change our community and its laws into the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sort of shithole they came from, then they wonder why everything has gone 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shit.
</EM><BR>
<P>Duuuuuuuuuuh, have you looked around lately? I've been to the US four times 
<BR>
in my life and I can see that American integration works just fine, because 
<BR>
you are creolizeing your cultures. That's the strength of America. I wish we 
<BR>
had it here in Europe too, instead of our racist policies of keeping people 
<BR>
out. Why all those derogatory remarks about immigrants?
<BR>
<P>When my parents moved up here from Massachusetts when I was a kid, they
<BR>
<EM>&gt;understood this, and we learned to live like the people around here lived.
</EM><BR>
<P>Should you really have done that? Was it really good? Transhumanism is all 
<BR>
about stretching borders, the borders of humanity for Pete's sake! If are 
<BR>
forced to conform to such a banal thing as a culture we might just as well 
<BR>
drop the whole of transhumanism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Vermont has the lowest homicide rates in the country, and the most liberal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;laws, but some moronic woman had the gall to actually complain in a letter 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the editor about her horror at learning how easy it is for a law abiding 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to carry a gun, completely oblivious to the fact that its obviously not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problem. (There were, as I recall, about 15 criminal homicides in 1999 in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Vermont, which has a population of about 450,000.)
</EM><BR>
<P>??? Relevance to immigration?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Orwell observed this same problem in England in the late 30's. The British 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;famous for their civility and politeness waiting for busses, trains, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trolleys. When eastern european refugees started coming to Britain in 1939, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;first there were few enough that the eastern habits of pushing and shoving 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the door got drilled out of newcomers by the larger number of native 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;passengers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, once the refugee population turned into a flood, the 'quality of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of waiting politely in line to get on a bus or train degraded down to that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the newcomers.
</EM><BR>
<P>They still stand in lines in London, so that isn't true. But really is 
<BR>
standing in line more &quot;civil&quot;? I have seen the Italian way of hanging around 
<BR>
in small groups waiting for the bus, and I find that more &quot;civil&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Opening your borders with any economy that does not behave as yours does 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opens your own economy up to being degraded by its association. Take our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;relationship with China, for example. We as a nation are benefitting from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;slave labor practices of the People's Republic of China. Their cheap 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are keeping our inflation low. But our morals and ethics have been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;degraded, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are externalizing the cost of the products we want onto the backs of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chinese
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;laborer who is not paid, or is paid little for his forced labor. I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;try to boycott any chinese made product. If I know a product was made in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;China,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I won't buy it. I would guess though that probably half of the stuff in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;apartment was made in china, or parts or resources for the stuff was made 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;china.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course you're welcome to boycot products from the PRC. But not all PRC 
<BR>
products are made of slave labour. Indeed, the small advances towards a 
<BR>
market economy are undermining the communist dictatorship. A tyrrany can 
<BR>
only benefit from closed border and no foreign trade, it still holds the 
<BR>
whip. But with trade it has to open up.
<BR>
I personally think that US ban of trade with Cuba has kept the tyrant Fidel 
<BR>
Castro in power for a longer time that would be necessary.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;We are now no better than those in the the Pre-civil war US who did not own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;slaves, did not allow slavery in our own states or communities, but still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefitted economically from slavery. Should we then institute an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'underground
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;railroad' of immigration?
</EM><BR>
<P>It is called &quot;capitalism&quot; and &quot;open borders&quot; today;-)
<BR>
<P>In the current case, people are not physically
<BR>
<EM>&gt;enslaved, they are enslaved by economic and social memes that create and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;perpetuate poor living conditions where they are at. Memetic shackles do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;come off when you cross the border, they stay with you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, say that to those Chinese that fled Mao Zedong's tyranny and built up 
<BR>
companies and businesses all over the world. &quot;You're all commies...&quot;
<BR>
<P>Slavery did not end with
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the underground railroad, you might notice. Only the civil war and the 14th
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;amendment did so.
</EM><BR>
<P>Slavery, didn't end with that either- only with the African- American people 
<BR>
entering the rest of society as they have largely done today.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If we opened immigration to everyone that wanted to live here, we'd shortly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;6 billion people living in the US, starving to death.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, everybody would go to the US, everyone would afford the ticket. And 
<BR>
nobody would work.
<BR>
<P>Hey, Americans!
<BR>
You're all immigrants!
<BR>
And you're the richest nation in the world!
<BR>
Those are the facts that economic history have shown us.
<BR>
<P>There is an important point to be made here as a transhumanist. People 
<BR>
aren't stupid, weak, and evil. The vast majority really do want to improve 
<BR>
themselves and make their lives better. I think this is more present in 
<BR>
those courageous enough to leave their old lives behind and go into the 
<BR>
great unknown
