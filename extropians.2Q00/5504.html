<EM>&gt; The element that the U.S. economy has in common with the Italian economy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under Mussolini is this:  legal title to capital assets is (in many cases,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though not in all cases) held by private individuals rather than by a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government.  Sometimes such individual ownership is indirect, such as where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a parent corporation owns subsidiary corporations--but if you trace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ownership all the way back through the parent corp. you find that the owner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is an individual person rather than a government.  However, even though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legal title to capital assets is directly or indirectly held by an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual, one branch or another of the government actually controls many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the functions of the corporation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I gave an example in an earlier post of a manufacturer of fasteners used in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the construction of nuclear power plants--let me elaborate a bit: title to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the business is held by, say, five shareholders.  One or more of them might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manage the business, or they might hire someone else to do it.  The person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who manages the business must follow federal guidelines for how the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machinery is set up, what sort of contracts the corp. can enter into with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; employees, what sort of restroom the building must have, what sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entryway the building must have, how quality control of the product must be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done, how and for what causes employees can be fired, how to determine which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; employees to hire, how much to pay low-skilled employees, how to structure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fringe benefits for employees, where raw materials can be obtained, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel certain there are more that I've left out.  This is NOT what I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call a free-market economy, which is why I said it seemed to be a mixture of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capitalism and fascism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Excellent illustration, Bonnie. Don't worry about the commonalities
<BR>
between communism and fascism. The Nazi Party was the National Socialist
<BR>
Workers Party, after all, and the brownshirts that fought streetfights
<BR>
with communist gangs in the 20's were not fighting an opposing ideology
<BR>
economically, but on political principles. The communists were very much
<BR>
internationalists, they gave allegiance to the International Communist
<BR>
Congress, while the fascists were Nationalists who also beleived in
<BR>
communism/socialism, but refused to sacrifice national sovereignty to
<BR>
the ComIntern. A similar situation can be found here in the US now,
<BR>
where you have the populist/nationalist/anti-internationalist Pat
<BR>
Buchanan and his followers finding supposedly strange bedfellows with
<BR>
the anti-WTO, anti-World Bank anarcho-socialists. The anarcho-socialists
<BR>
purportedly do not swear allegiance to the nascent 5th ComIntern, which
<BR>
is actually more of a front for Russian ex-KGB agents turned mafia, but
<BR>
frankly, their record for candidness and honesty does not encourage me
<BR>
to believe them.
<BR>
<P>In Nazi Germany, the best double agents were frequently communists
<BR>
working for Stalin. Many German communists saw so little difference
<BR>
between the Nazis and the Communists that they pragmatically decided to
<BR>
join the Nazis when it seemed they were the ones with the winning hand.
<BR>
The most convincing arguments the Nazis used against the Jews were
<BR>
actually ones that painted the Jews as capitalist running dog war
<BR>
profiteers that had run Germany into the ground in WWI for the sake of
<BR>
profits. These arguments resonated with the communist/socialist
<BR>
sympathizers in the German population.
