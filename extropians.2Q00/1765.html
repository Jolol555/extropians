<P>
Blech, phooey....  The Reuters piece is a classic example of good
<BR>
science getting munged by the press.  I've commented appropriately
<BR>
on some of the excesses the press may have solicited from the
<BR>
authors and would encourage the authors to put a little less &quot;spin&quot;
<BR>
on their work in the future.  The last thing the field of anti-aging
<BR>
research needs is to build a history of excessive claims by scientists.
<BR>
<P>On Fri, 28 Apr 2000, Doug Skrecky posted a copy of a Cryonet message #13652:

<EM>&gt; Report: Cloning Produces Unnaturally Young Cattle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Correspondent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) -
</EM><BR>
<P>Could one of our super-sleuths come up with an Email address for Maggie?
<BR>
She could use a copy of this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Scientists who cloned six cows said on Thursday the animals show
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signs of being even younger than their chronological ages, and said this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could mean cloning technology offers a true fountain of youth.
</EM><BR>
<P>Crap, absolute crap.  What is the meaning of &quot;younger&quot;?
<BR>
What the Science article says is &quot;Extension of cell life-span...&quot;.
<BR>
Even that term is misleading because strictly speaking, the &quot;life-span&quot;
<BR>
of a cell is how long the cell lives.  The article should have said
<BR>
&quot;Extension of cellular replication capability...&quot;.
<BR>
Sloppy work on the part of the Science editors.
<BR>
<P>Recent publications have called into question the early simplistic
<BR>
assumptions regarding telomere length and aging.  For example
<BR>
see: Modello, C. et al, &quot;Telemere length in fibroblasts and blood cells
<BR>
from healthy centenarians&quot;. Exp. Cell Res 1999 10;248(1):234-42.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The cloning process seemed to have literally turned back the aging clock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the cells of the six heifers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since there is no clear scientific picture of cellular aging at a
<BR>
molecular level (only early hints of how gene expression may change),
<BR>
and a couple of marker genes (e.g. Campisi's work) it is excessive to
<BR>
claim the aging clock has been turned back.  The article abstract cites
<BR>
the measurement of one gene only (EPC-1).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The researchers said it might be possible to use cloning to create organs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that are nearly immortal for use in transplants, or tissue lines to treat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diseases of aging such as Alzheimer's, arthritis and heart disease.
</EM><BR>
<P>How?  Treating Alzheimer's with a &quot;cloned&quot; brain, arthritis with
<BR>
cloned joints and heart disease with meters of cloned blood vessels?.
<BR>
Claims in these areas should stick with examples where we have known
<BR>
applications for &quot;cell-replacement&quot; (not organ-replacement).
<BR>
Parkinson's treatments or repopulation of the immune system after
<BR>
chemotherapy to treat leukemia would be better choices for possible
<BR>
applications.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``Not only were we able to clone calves ... but these animals appear to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have cells younger than their chronological age,'' Robert Lanza of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Advanced Cell Technology, Inc., who led the study, said in a telephone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interview.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only if you assume telomere length is a measure of chronological age.
<BR>
This statement is like saying a decrease in accumulated DNA mutations
<BR>
or protein glycosylation results in &quot;younger&quot; cells.  Aging is a
<BR>
multifactorial process.  Only when the complete measurement of *all*
<BR>
the aging related biomarkers is feasible and the work done by ACT
<BR>
demonstrates that their work impacts *all* of them, should they make
<BR>
claims regarding clones having &quot;younger&quot; cells.  The accurate statement
<BR>
would be that the cells have &quot;increased replicative potential and
<BR>
show indications of gene expression patterns typical of 'younger'
<BR>
cells&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clock Gets Reset
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``What we showed in this paper is this clock gets reset. It gets wound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back up,'' said Dr. Michael West, president and chief executive officer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the Worcester, Massachusetts-based company. ``It remains to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; determined whether this would extend the life of the animal.''
</EM><BR>
<P>The jury is still out on whether telomeres represent &quot;a clock&quot;.
<BR>
West at least makes an appropriately conservative statement
<BR>
regarding animal longevity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The findings, published in the journal Science, are surprising because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the most famous cloned animal, Dolly the sheep, appears to be older than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; her chronological age.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again we have people equating telomere length and &quot;age&quot;!
<BR>
<P>Anyone who understands the mechanism by which telomerase acts would
<BR>
understand that should be able (in theory) to reset telomeres length
<BR>
to a juvenile state or even longer.  The article indicates that their
<BR>
results &quot;could be due to species differences and/or differences in
<BR>
nuclear transfer techniques or donor cell types&quot;.
<BR>
<P>So, they have confirmed what one would have expected but don't know
<BR>
how they did it...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When they are frayed beyond repair, the cell dies. This stage is known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as senescence.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is simply wrong.  The cells *DO NOT DIE*.  They simply cease
<BR>
to replicate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dolly had old telomeres. But the six heifers, cloned from cells taken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from a 45-day-old fetus, have exceptionally young telomeres.
</EM><BR>
<P>Better would be the terms &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot;, not &quot;old&quot; and &quot;young&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``The egg cells acts like a little time machine and can take it back, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far as we can tell, to the beginning of life,'' West said.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fine, I can accept that.  There has to be a mechanism for reglating
<BR>
the activity of telomerase in germ cells.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``It's the first day in a new era in treating age-related disease,''
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; West said.
</EM><BR>
<P>A tad extreme, particularly given that they don't know how they
<BR>
produced the effect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``If you had a damaged heart, we could take a few cells from you and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grow up new heart cells and these would be your own cells so you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't reject them,'' added Lanza.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know of no work that uses muscle &quot;grafts&quot; onto a heart to strengthen it.
<BR>
Far better would be the growth of a new heart, and we are a long way
<BR>
from that until we completely understand the regulatory processes
<BR>
in complex organ development and someone has demonstrated control
<BR>
over those processes in the lab.  We can do skin and a few other
<BR>
organs today, but we are far from growing organs that have complex
<BR>
cellular or physiological architectures.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of course, this would involve technically cloning the patient --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something called therapeutic cloning -- and there would be opposition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to allowing it.
</EM><BR>
<P>This doesn't involve cloning the whole patient, it involves growing
<BR>
new organs from the patient's cells.  Once telomerase regulation
<BR>
is understood, it should be possible to lengthen the telomeres
<BR>
*without* going through a cloning process.  Cloning is a rather
<BR>
expensive and unnecessary process [1896 oocytes used, 87 positives
<BR>
(5%) after just the first step]. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lanza said his team does not quite understand how the heifers became
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``younger''. But he said genes whose activity usually dies down as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cell ages were especially active.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``These results suggest the animals are younger than their biological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; age,'' Lanza said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>This would be interesting, because it could imply some type of switch
<BR>
or imprinting that could keep telomerase (or other &quot;youth promoting&quot;
<BR>
genes) active longer.  It is going to be interesting to see how this
<BR>
relates to the CR work and theories that sexual maturity shifts
<BR>
resources from maintenence and repair into reproduction.  If they
<BR>
have accidentally stumbled on a switch for youthful maintenence and
<BR>
can understand what they did, then it really would be a breakthrough.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ``When other cows the same age start to grow old and frail, their cells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be able to divide the same as a newborn calf's. They should be able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to repair damage due to disease and aging and should live longer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; healthier lives.
</EM><BR>
<P>The results are only going to impact tissues with dividing cells.
<BR>
Accumulated damage and death of non-dividing cells will be unaffected.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Only time will tell. Cows allowed to lead natural lives live to be 24
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and older.
</EM><BR>
<P>So anyone over 60 will likely be dead before we know for sure...
