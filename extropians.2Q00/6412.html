I'm pretty cynical when it comes to government, and my opinion is that
<BR>
spending time and resources lobbying it or otherwise participating in that
<BR>
process is a waste. You really have to find some way to jump outside of
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>Does anyone know if Havenco/Sealand is going to establish a bank and
<BR>
online stock brokerage?

<EM>&gt; !Zowwwie!! That's it!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Okay, here's the problem with Transhumanism/Extropianism: we're never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to be a mass movement. We're never going to be populists.  Jane
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bluecollar isn't going to vote for a candidate from the Extropian Party
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or view a webcast of Extro 10 or join the Institute. Why? Not because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we're all elitists, and we don't want her around. Simply because a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the stuff we're talking about isn't very accessible, and doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make an impact in people's live here and now. Yes, it may make an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impact on their lives five or ten years from now, but you can't eat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, and you can't use that to pay the rent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Up till now, I've been quietly assuming that the best we can hope for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is to slowly influence the ideas of media, corporate, and government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leaders who hail from more broad-based movements and do have populist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; credibility. To an extent this has been happening-- probably mostly due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a tech-driven economic boom, but we may have played some small part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in that as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This thread, however, points the way to a new path. What if we incorporate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appropriate, affordable technology into our agenda? The social problem of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the future will be lack of access to information and technology. Duh.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's so obvious that the liberals have already started talking about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, and the conservatives will be soon to follow, so as not be left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behind by the liberals. Yet, what do they have to offer? They don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even understand the technology that the technology have-nots need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access to. Some of them *are* the technology have-nots and don't know it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, to be clear-- I'm not talking about socialism. I'm not talking about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lobbying for higher taxes so we can buy third world farmers 500 MHz pentia.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm talking about helping people in intelligent, elegant ways. In ways that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will make them self-sufficient. Maybe even in ways that also enrich the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helpers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe we won't reach Jane Bluecollar in London or New York.  But this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be the foundation of an unlikely alliance between the resources and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know how of the industrialized world educated elite and the poor people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the third world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Specifics? Give me a break, this has just occurred to me. All I'm saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is, appropriate and affordable technology should be given more and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attention in our discussions. It's as important as AI, genomics, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all that other good stuff.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the altruists out there-- we can help the needy in ways that few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others have the expertise or imagination to do. I probably already had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you from the second paragraph onward, so I'll stop preaching to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choir.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the egoists out there-- a world of tech savvy, tech-heeled people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be more receptive to our ideas, especially if we're the ones who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helped them get that way. The West is spoiled. You want to see a place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where they love technology? Look to a place where they don't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough of it. Besides, this will also really confuse the liberals--
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;What? Those Techno-Libertarians are *helping* people? How low can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they sink?&quot;
