If you are going to live 2000 years, sooner or later you are going to have 
<BR>
to deal with the cleaning up the mess of your miss-spent youth (e.g. 
<BR>
pollution). So a *real* &quot;long-term&quot; perspective includes an accounting for 
<BR>
the commons, a desire to utilize and allocate resources most efficiently, 
<BR>
and a desire to uplift others to your level (because its going to get damn 
<BR>
boring talking to 10^10 copies of yourself), etc.

Agreed. In addition, if the &quot;have-nots&quot; aren't permitted to join the haves&quot; 
<BR>
you run the risk of envy, which leads to things like looting and burning and 
<BR>
other behavior by the lumpen masses which tends to annoy the elite. History 
<BR>
has shown that the prols are not happy eating  cake, while he elite dine on 
<BR>
fine beef.- -Zero

<P>This also hinges on the power difference between the &quot;haves&quot; and 
<BR>
&quot;have-nots.&quot;  I would hope that the access to knowledge and technology will 
<BR>
not be so limited to the public that they are not simply at the mercy of the 
<BR>
government and corporate elite.  I would hope that the continued rise in 
<BR>
influence, wealth and education of the 'middle-classes' will continue and it 
<BR>
would seem that this will happen.
<BR>
<P>In 2050, there will still be &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; but the definitions 
<BR>
will have changed.  This has been talked about on the list before, 
<BR>
certainly.  A 2050 &quot;have-not&quot; may have a lifestyle that only a 
<BR>
multi-millioniare has now, and yet will feel frustrated by living when 
<BR>
looking at the &quot;haves&quot; who can afford certain services and luxuries that 
<BR>
they cannot.
<BR>
<P>I am curious to know what the list members think will be the real  
<BR>
differences between the &quot;haves and the have-nots&quot; a half-century from now?
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
