<P>
Sean Kenny's post got me thinking and I wanted to share something
<BR>
with you all.
<BR>
<P>Last Nov I was just finishing up a serious weight lifting session
<BR>
when I started feeling really lousy. I had been diagnosed with GERD
<BR>
three months prior which led to the very extropian decision to give
<BR>
up alcohol period.
<BR>
<P>Anyway I was experiencing classic head-to-the-ER symptoms which I
<BR>
tried to ignore because I figured it was the GERD acting up. The
<BR>
next morning I still felt lousy, cursed myself for being stupid,
<BR>
and headed to the ER. I got to spend the next 24 hours as a guest,
<BR>
went through standard cardiac enzyme series tests and a treadmill
<BR>
stress-test. (all negative) An endoscope exam a few weeks ago
<BR>
revealed a bad case of antral gastritis, getting better every day.
<BR>
<P>My point? Even exercising regularly. eating right, and a state of
<BR>
the art vitamin/antioxident protocol is no guarantee. I hadn't been
<BR>
to the doctor in years. Now it's going to be an annual event.
<BR>
<P>GERD has symptoms that will completely convince you that you are
<BR>
having a heart attack. Ever since I've been carrying what I call my
<BR>
&quot;extropian amulet&quot;. Its a small stainless steel cylinder designed
<BR>
for heart patients to carry a nitro tab around in, mine contains a
<BR>
couple of baby aspirin, just in case. It is attached to my keyring,
<BR>
is tiny, and unobtrusive.
<BR>
<P>Not a bad idea at all, and unlike most amulets this one has real
<BR>
protective powers.....
