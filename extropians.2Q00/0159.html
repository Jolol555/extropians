</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; So I got to thinking: What if Calvin is right, and our cortex has lots of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; small areas that are independently active and compete with each other to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; produce the overall thought?  What if we could cut out a square inch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; cortex (containing many complete active-areas) and implant it in another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; brain?  That would leave the donor almost unchanged... but the recipient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; would have access to some of the thoughts and memories, and maybe even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; patterns of thought, of the donor, if the thoughts were strong enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; spread through the rest of the brain and become conscious.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That wasn't me.  That was Christopher J. Phoenix (I think - it's from memory).
</EM><BR>
<P>I know it. But I see that I made the mistake of not properly changing
<BR>
the originator. Mea culpa.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The loss of a square inch of cortex may not always be immediately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; noticeable to the person losing it, but I wouldn't recommend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it. Calvin's ideas are not very accepted by the mainstream, and given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; my limited understanding of them it is not obvious that the transplant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would work since the patterns are highly dependent on having the right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; subcortical afferents - without their context they are meaningless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (FYI, there's an article on &quot;columns&quot; in my &quot;MIT Encyclopedia of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cognitive Sciences&quot; and it's by William Calvin.  I don't know about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;accepted&quot;, but one would think that his theories are known to the mainstream.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I recall that this only deals with the &quot;normal&quot; columns, the
<BR>
hiearchical organisation of the neurons in the cortex into small
<BR>
columns (microcolumns, hypercolumns and whatnot). This is not
<BR>
controversial at all, and I think Calvin is indeed redgarded as an
<BR>
expert on this. But his theory of self-replicating mosaics is not
<BR>
widely believed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As far as I can tell, the primary problem with the theory is that if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transplanted a section of cortex, or a hemisphere, we wouldn't possess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the technology to wire it into the rest of the brain.  If severing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corpus callosum works as a surgical procedure, than switching the left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hemispheres of two epileptic infants will still create a severed corpus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; callosum.  Transplanting a square inch just gives a square inch that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connected only to itself and not to anything around it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, this is true. I didn't mention it because it was too obvious :-)
