Is this site strictly about discussions of how to terraform Mars and similar 
<BR>
but non-immediate problems or is there anyone, like me, interested in 
<BR>
discussing how to live long enough to get there with the youth and wealth to 
<BR>
enjoy it? I don't think the two discussions are mutually exclusive: they are 
<BR>
both important and IMHO equally fascinating. Or to open the discussion still 
<BR>
wider; am I asking my questions in the wrong arena? Is there another site 
<BR>
that I should be addressing?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>This is the place(to quote a certain nineteenth century religious leader)!!  
<BR>
ALOT of different topics are discussed here and life-extension in its many 
<BR>
forms and wealth-building are certainly a part of that.
<BR>
<P>Also, please consider signing up with the Cryonet list.  Even if at this 
<BR>
point you do not want to sign up for a cryonics suspension you will find 
<BR>
some informative posts there on life-extension as well as discussion of how 
<BR>
best to invest one's money.  And you might just wind up deciding cryonics is 
<BR>
right for you!
<BR>
