<P><EM>      &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;&gt;if you ignore natures advice you go broke, as well you should.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Sure, thats a given. Then what happens?
</EM><BR>
<P>Then you either get smart or you rely on the kindness of strangers.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; You are a) assuming Mr. Fusion Inc would want to hire union workers,
</EM><BR>
<P>What's with you and union workers? I mean, you're being so 20'th century.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;and b) need to hire anywhere near as many people to produce machines
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;that produce the same power demands as the former energy industry.
</EM><BR>
<P>It doesn't matter. Energy that was virtually free and limitless would open up all
<BR>
sorts of opportunities that just aren't practical now, and all those endeavors would
<BR>
need personnel.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;From an economic viewpoint, defense spending is an excellent incubator for
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;research and development.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Excellent&quot; is not quite the word I would use to categorize the results obtained from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hundreds of billions spent by the military on research and development, &quot;terrible&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or &quot;meager&quot; would be better. I can see 3 reasons for this:
<BR>
<P>1) There is far more development than research, and the development is for things
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that have little or no use in civilian life; stealth technology for example.
<BR>
<P>2) The cost of something is of no interest to the military mind, hence you get a B1
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bomber that is quite literally worth more than its weight in gold. This mindset conflicts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with that of consumers and stockholders who would rather not spend $900 for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Momentum Impulse Driver and will just get a $3.98 hammer at Home Depot instead.
<BR>
<P>3) If they do find something interesting they keep it secret for years.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>         &gt;When grain shipments to europe got cut off, and  interest rates rose
</EM><BR>
<P>And neither event had anything to do with technology or productivity, it has everything to
<BR>
do with government and civil servants who were not as smart as they thought they were.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;food was left rotting on  the docks and in the fields, prices collapsed
</EM><BR>
<P>No argument, it's a matter of historical fact, but I don't see how that helps your case.
