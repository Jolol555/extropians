<EM>&gt; Does anyone know if there is any legislation being talked about to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevent these cameras from being used for other than their claimed purpose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of catching red light runners?  Whether or no, as has been previously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointed out, people are being made, little by little, used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being watched.  I personally don't care if the power behind the camera is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government or corporate, I'm against it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I became part of the 'cryonics crowd,' I made a deal with myself that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wouldn't become frightened enough of death to live a longer life less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worth living.  That means I'm still willing to sacrifice my life for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others if I see the need, and that I'm very cautious about sacrificing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom for the sake of security.

<P>Unfortunately, I don't see any way to avoid public surveillance in the long
<BR>
run. We can stage a holding action to slow down government efforts for a
<BR>
while, and I definitely think this is worth doing. However, eventually
<BR>
(10-15 years) wearable computers with audiovisual recording capability are
<BR>
going to become so commonplace that you'll have to assume anything you do in
<BR>
public is being picked up on someone's camera. At that point it isn't going
<BR>
to be practical to keep government from doing the same thing.
<BR>
<P>I do, however, think that we can draw a solid boundary between surveillance
<BR>
of public and private spaces. Setting up cameras inside someone's home is
<BR>
far more expensive, less reliable, and more intrusive than putting cameras
<BR>
on street lights. It also requires a much greater degree of consent -
<BR>
stopping the government from putting cameras on their own property is much
<BR>
harder than stopping them from putting cameras on yours. Fortunately, there
<BR>
isn't much prospect of the government ever getting that level of consent
<BR>
(after all, they would have to put cameras in your bedroom, and almost no
<BR>
one will go along with that).
