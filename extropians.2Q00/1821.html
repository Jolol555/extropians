<P>
While reviewing a recent paper by Robert Freitas in which he
<BR>
is exploring the limits to global ecophagy by nanotech
<BR>
(i.e. what are the real limits to the grey goo problem),
<BR>
I realized that we *already* have a green goo problem
<BR>
driven by the planetary biomass.  This green goo has already
<BR>
has spread across our entire planet, mutating as it goes,
<BR>
depleting the atmosphere of the once abundant CO2.  Convienently
<BR>
for us it has created an O2 rich atmosphere and an environmental
<BR>
niche in which we have developed.
<BR>
<P>However(!), it is important to remember that this epidemic
<BR>
is in no way controlled or constrained.  Joshua Lederberg,
<BR>
the nobel prize winner, has observed frequently that if
<BR>
HIV had been an airborne virus, the human race would probably
<BR>
be toast by now.  The viral/bacterial epidemic breakout
<BR>
books, written as &quot;scare&quot; novels, do contain a core
<BR>
element of something that should concern humanity --
<BR>
namely that the selfish genes of the biomass do not
<BR>
care whether we survive.   In microbiology it is frequently
<BR>
thought that pathogens evolve to coexist with the host,
<BR>
since killing the host destroys the environmental niches
<BR>
that they require to survive.  That does not however
<BR>
imply that pathogens are &quot;intelligent&quot; enough to self-evolve
<BR>
as harmless parasites in the beginning.  They might as
<BR>
easily evolve as rapidly spreading killing machines
<BR>
before they become attenuated. 
<BR>
<P>As Lederberg pointed out in the April 14, 2000 Science
<BR>
in his article on &quot;The Microbial World Wide Web&quot;,
<BR>
(URL: <A HREF="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/288/5464/291">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/288/5464/291</A>),
<BR>
the biomass of this planet is conducting an unregulated,
<BR>
largely unmonitored, &quot;experiment&quot; in information exchange and the
<BR>
evolution of self-replicating machines, some of which have the
<BR>
ability to kill humans, on a scale that staggers the imagination.
<BR>
<P>So, the question I would pose for humanity is:
<BR>
Should we create a long term goal the neutering of all rapidly
<BR>
replicating biomass species, especially bacteria, and modify
<BR>
them so they cannot support rapidly mutating viruses, so as to
<BR>
reduce our long term risks of extinction?
<BR>
<P>This implies to a large degree creating a completely artificial
<BR>
biomass environment.  We would need to develop, grow, test for safety,
<BR>
neuter and release all supporting biomass elements.  Only conscious
<BR>
programming of the bioenvironment, perhaps with extensive
<BR>
simulations for effects we cannot anticipate would allow
<BR>
us to engineer a world safe for long-term human habitation.
<BR>
Failing to do this would clearly be playing Russian roulette
<BR>
with our species.
<BR>
<P>Greg, you might want to post this question to some of the lists
<BR>
you are part of since it forces the individuals to confront the
<BR>
long term question of whether or not they have an interest in
<BR>
the survival of the human race.
<BR>
<P>Also, for those of you who are curious, the aforementioned paper
<BR>
is *very* interesting and will likely be available for comment
<BR>
and discussion at the Foresight SA meeting.
