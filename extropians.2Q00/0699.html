A Russian scientist claims to have discovered  a theoretical type of
<BR>
wormhole that would be self-stabilizing without the need for input of
<BR>
&quot;negative energy.&quot;

<P><P><EM>&gt;Voyages across the Universe have come light years closer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;FASTEN your seatbelts and hold on tight-intergalactic space travel is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;back on the agenda. Sceptics who dismiss the idea of faster-than-light
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;travel through &quot;wormholes&quot; in space may have to think again, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;new calculations based on Einstein's general theory of relativity suggest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that wormholes large and stable enough to allow intergalactic travel really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can exist.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The possibility that the cosmos is peppered with short cuts through space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and time has intrigued people ever since 1915 when German theorist Ludwig
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Flamm found hints of their existence in Einstein's equations. While attempts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to unify the fundamental forces of nature suggest that tiny quantum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wormholes may exist, most experts suspect that some fundamental law of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;physics prevents the formation of large wormholes-not least because these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would theoretically allow time travellers to go back in time and, say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prevent their own birth by accidentally killing one of their parents.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now a Russian theorist has found a new type of wormhole that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compatible with the known laws of physics, yet can be as big and stable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as you like. According to Sergei Krasnikov, a relativity expert at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Pulkovo Observatory in St Petersburg, the standard arguments against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;large wormholes assume that they all have the same basic shape, and need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be crammed with &quot;exotic matter&quot; to keep them open (New Scientist, 6
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;September 1997, p 49).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Such exotic matter has never been seen, but theory suggests it can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;created literally out of nothing when space and time are curved in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right way. What Krasnikov has found is a new type of wormhole that can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;create its own supply of exotic matter-and in sufficient quantities to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it big enough and keep it open long enough for people to use.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;This new wormhole, like every other, needs exotic matter for it to form,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and like some others can produce it by itself,&quot; Krasnikov told New
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Scientist. &quot;What's new is that this wormhole actually generates enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to make it arbitrarily large.&quot; Other theorists admit to being intrigued by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the new work, but remain cautious.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;It's worth taking seriously,&quot; says Ian Moss, a relativity expert at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;University of Newcastle upon Tyne. &quot;The main worry is that it could fall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;down on some technical detail.&quot; Paul Davies of Imperial College, London,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;adds that proving something is theoretically possible does not prove it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually exists: &quot;My feeling is that the matter is still open,&quot; he says.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Krasnikov accepts that testing his claims by building a wormhole is far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beyond present technology. Even so, such wormholes may have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;left over from the big bang, he says-and finding one would have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dramatic effect on interstellar travel: &quot;If there is a wormhole connecting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the vicinities of the Earth and the star Vega, one can take a short cut by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;flying through it.&quot;
