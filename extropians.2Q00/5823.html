re:&quot;Driving over him once you could dismiss as an accident. If you changed

<BR>
<EM> &gt; went over him a second time, you might have some problems...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>You may find this useful as many statutes are uniform:
<BR>
<P>RCW 9A.16.020
<BR>
Use of force -- When lawful.
<BR>
The use, attempt, or offer to use force upon or toward the person of another 
<BR>
is not unlawful in the following cases:
<BR>
<P>(1) Whenever necessarily used by a public officer in the performance of a 
<BR>
legal duty, or a person assisting the officer and acting under the officer's 
<BR>
direction;
<BR>
<P>(2) Whenever necessarily used by a person arresting one who has committed a 
<BR>
felony and delivering him or her to a public officer competent to receive 
<BR>
him or her into custody;
<BR>
<P>(3) Whenever used by a party about to be injured, or by another lawfully 
<BR>
aiding him or her, in preventing or attempting to prevent an offense against 
<BR>
his or her person, or a malicious trespass, or other malicious interference 
<BR>
with real or personal property lawfully in his or her possession, in case 
<BR>
the force is not more than is necessary;
<BR>
<P>(4) Whenever reasonably used by a person to detain someone who enters or 
<BR>
remains unlawfully in a building or on real property lawfully in the 
<BR>
possession of such person, so long as such detention is reasonable in 
<BR>
duration and manner to investigate the reason for the detained person's 
<BR>
presence on the premises, and so long as the premises in question did not 
<BR>
reasonably appear to be intended to be open to members of the public;
<BR>
<P>(5) Whenever used by a carrier of passengers or the carrier's authorized 
<BR>
agent or servant, or other person assisting them at their request in 
<BR>
expelling from a carriage, railway car, vessel, or other vehicle, a 
<BR>
passenger who refuses to obey a lawful and reasonable regulation prescribed 
<BR>
for the conduct of passengers, if such vehicle has first been stopped and 
<BR>
the force used is not more than is necessary to expel the offender with 
<BR>
reasonable regard to the offender's personal safety;
<BR>
<P>(6) Whenever used by any person to prevent a mentally ill, mentally 
<BR>
incompetent, or mentally disabled person from committing an act dangerous to 
<BR>
any person, or in enforcing necessary restraint for the protection or 
<BR>
restoration to health of the person, during such period only as is necessary 
<BR>
to obtain legal authority for the restraint or custody of the person.

<EM> &gt; &gt; BTW, in my cab driving days I once had a belligerent passenger 
</EM><BR>
(standing
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; behind the open left rear door) grab my left wrist as I reached back 
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; the cash awkwardly offered from behind.  He started to lift a weapon in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; his right hand (I never did see exactly what it was), so I threw the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; gearshift in reverse and ran him over with the door.  If I'd thought
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; just a bit faster I'd have cocked the wheel to my right to swing the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; front of the car over him, too.  Asshole.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Driving over him once you could dismiss as an accident. If you changed 
</EM><BR>
gears and
<BR>
<EM> &gt; went over him a second time, you might have some problems...
</EM><BR>
<P>Hell, I backed up all the way to the end of the block, did a skidding
<BR>
90° turn, the door slammed when I hit the brakes, and I burned rubber
<BR>
out of there.  He may have had a gun, I'd lost track of his buddy, and I
<BR>
had his bait $10 bill for a $7 fare, so I figured I won... don't mess
<BR>
with a cabbie, he has a lethal weapon at his fingertips.
<BR>
<P>Those were exciting days.  Now I just run rocket engines from two feet
<BR>
away :)
