</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you need to start with an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;enormous positive cash balance to make the system economically viable; a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Ponzi scheme would quickly collapse and the taxation required would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;destroy the economy.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I find this hard to belive. After all, you already pointed out that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; providing the net direct to the poor would halve the current costs.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I am referring to long-term stability and solvency.  The current U.S.
<BR>
system is stable because the payout is sufficiently low that
<BR>
relatively few people become habituated to it.  This is a separate issue
<BR>
from the phenomenal waste that occurs in doing so.  At some threshold (and
<BR>
I am quite sure the poverty line is above that threshold), the system will
<BR>
de-stabilize economically, because the cost-benefit ratio will favor
<BR>
leeching for all but the people who actually enjoy working.  Actually, I
<BR>
think the people that truly enjoy working (a fair percentage of most
<BR>
populations) pretty much carry socialist systems as a consequence of their
<BR>
nature.  A system needs to be unattractive to people who would otherwise
<BR>
be productive members of a market economy.  The moment productive members
<BR>
of society start becoming part of the welfare roles, a runaway feedback
<BR>
loop will happen that will eventually collapse the system over the long
<BR>
run.
<BR>
<P>Incidentally, I lived well below the U.S. poverty line for two-thirds of
<BR>
my life.  The only &quot;welfare&quot; we ever received was some Food aid during the
<BR>
really bad times when I was a kid.  Fact is, a lot of people lead
<BR>
comfortable, happy lives at incomes below the &quot;poverty line&quot;.  People who
<BR>
don't do well economically at any level are typically the ones that make
<BR>
poor choices, not ones who receive less than some arbitrary amount of
<BR>
money.  
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;how would differences in cost of living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be accounted for?  The poverty line in the greater Silicon Valley area
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would put one in the upper middle class in North Dakota. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How does it work with aged pensions now? Everyone gets the same, no? With
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this minimal security, people might well up-sticks and move somewhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cheaper. The hope is that sufficient of them will use this stake/security
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to start some productive enterprise or fund their education, not just kick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back. And then this added wealth will be cropped to help support the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The problem is that fixed income individuals who aren't working have
<BR>
different economic goals than people who do work.  In fact, you can see
<BR>
this pattern in the U.S. when you look at where people go to retire versus
<BR>
where people go for jobs.
<BR>
<P>People who are retiring typically look (on paper) a lot like a Minimum
<BR>
Income welfare recipient.  Therefore, people who retire attempt to
<BR>
maximize their income by re-locating from where they lived to work, to a
<BR>
locale that is better suited to a small, fixed income.  In the U.S., these
<BR>
are typically states with no taxes, very cheap cost of living, decent
<BR>
lifestyle, and good weather.  As the percentage of retired people in the
<BR>
U.S. explodes, you are seeing the populations of states such as Nevada and
<BR>
Florida explode as well.  Unfortunately, all the prime locales for fixed
<BR>
income living are also some of the poorer areas for finding good jobs. 
<BR>
<P>The consequence of strong employment opportunities and a strong local
<BR>
economy is that cost of living tends to go up as well.  Supply and demand.
<BR>
A person on a Minimum Income in Las Vegas, Nevada would live a comfortable
<BR>
life *and* be in an environment that offers mediocre employment
<BR>
opportunities.  Situations like these pretty much ensure problems.  I
<BR>
wouldn't want to encourage people to live in areas that also don't offer
<BR>
reasonable opportunities for productivity.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; But you might be right. And so might I. More probably there's a better way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neither of us have thought of. And the Spike will make it all redundant in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 50 years or so anyway. But meanwhile, I'm happy to `buy the bastards off',
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if one insists on seeing it that way -- while keeping the ill effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contained by suitable security measures as are required, and by social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering if that's possible.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I don't really care about the leeches one way or the other.  I am more
<BR>
concerned that the solution to the leech problem may induce otherwise
<BR>
productive individuals to also become leeches.  How much money does it
<BR>
take to buy off a leech so that they don't cause trouble?  A fair amount
<BR>
I'd imagine.  Also, many of the leeches tend to have behavioral issues
<BR>
that are the real problem anyway, and which are unlikely to go away simply
<BR>
by giving them money.  Rodney King the millionaire is still getting
<BR>
regularly arrested for the same stuff that got him arrested before his
<BR>
famous incident with the police.
