<P><EM>&gt; I think whatever influence Foresight had developed is rapidly fading. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helped bring things this far, but are going to be pushed out of the way

<EM>&gt; and kept on the fringe. Reminds me of how Jodie Foster's character got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; treated in the movie Contact when her boss took all the credit for her work.
</EM><BR>
<P>That in no way discounts the foundation that they have laid or the
<BR>
vision they have that many of the senior associates find invaluable
<BR>
in thinking about the future and/or charting their personal life courses.
<BR>
<P>How many American's go around every day saying &quot;Thank you Columbus!&quot; 
<BR>
(or Henry Ford or Andrew Carnegie, etc.) :-?
<BR>
<P>Hal (quoting Wired?) said:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; In others cases, the expectations seem naïve and unrealistic: these are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; primarily being advanced by a vocal cult of futurists whose enthusiasm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is beyond question, but whose agenda is not. I will argue that for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real science to proceed, nanotechnologists ought to distance themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the giggle factor and position themselves for the serious work of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 21st century.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I get ambitious, when he gets back to Stanford, I may contact him
<BR>
and ask him to be specific about *exactly* what he thinks the agenda
<BR>
is and what he claims is objectionable about it.  You have to force
<BR>
people hand-waving to back up what they say, or clearly label them
<BR>
Scientific American-ites.
<BR>
<P>You have to ask him if he views the &quot;distancing&quot; from the &quot;giggle factor&quot;
<BR>
as simple pragmatism because people cannot deal with the paradigm shifts
<BR>
that are expected (and these folks 'rationally' want to get funded) or
<BR>
whether he believes they will not occur.  And if he believes they will
<BR>
not occur you have to get him to explain *why*.
<BR>
<P>Finally, I wouldn't count the Foresight Inst. down-and-out quite yet.
<BR>
At least one person at the NIH conference had papers at the FI conference
<BR>
last year.  So did someone from the &quot;nano-pen&quot; group that now had
<BR>
the recent parallel nano-pens announcement.  So, while they may be
<BR>
&quot;claiming&quot; distance, they still submit papers to the FI conference!
<BR>
<P>Bottom line, there are people who cannot (or will not) connect the
<BR>
dots.  I suspect most of them have never written a line of code
<BR>
in their lives where you generally start with nothing and get
<BR>
something.  People who do nothing every day but take stuff apart
<BR>
that nature has put together are naturally going to think engineering
<BR>
this stuff will be very hard.  After all, nature hasn't really
<BR>
designed an &quot;obvious&quot; or &quot;simple&quot; system.
