<EM>&gt; &gt;I wouldn't say it quite that way--art that avoids constraints is crap,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;like most free verse or abstract visual art or interpretive dance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Great art thrives on constraints: sonnets, realistic visual art, ballet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The constraints, though, are chosen by the artist.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree wholeheartedly.  Most of the enjoyment I get out of art is in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creation of constraints.  For example when I was somewhat more poetically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inclined, I created an interesting form of sixteen lines with sixteen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; syllables per line.  The symmetry it creates can be very intriguing, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becomes both mathematical and artistic.  Music is the same way: it is all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time signatures and note choice.  That's why a song in 9/8 is usually more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting than the standard 4/4.  As I have been saying for years,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science and art have more in common than is commonly thought.
</EM><BR>
<P>Another problem here is that while we can from the outside or post hoc view
<BR>
it this way and perhaps the artist can internally do so, often the
<BR>
feeling -- as conveyed by various artists in their writings (from my
<BR>
readings of, e.g., the letters of painter Vinvent van Gogh and the essays of
<BR>
poet Richard Hugo here) that they might not directly see the constraints
<BR>
they are working with, but rather the ones they are working against.  By
<BR>
this is meant, if one rebels against a certain style by coming up with a new
<BR>
one, the latter is seen as liberating rather than taking off old shackles
<BR>
and putting on new ones.  (No doubt part of this is that one has not yet
<BR>
fully explored the bounds of the new constraints.)
<BR>
<P>I would also point out, too, that some artists view their work as exposing
<BR>
some truth about the world.  This is a view which I'm sympathetic to.  For
<BR>
instance, van Gogh, wrote:
<BR>
<P>&quot;I can still find no better definition of art than this,
<BR>
Art is man added to nature - nature, reality, truth,
<BR>
but with a significance, a conception, a character,
<BR>
which the artist brings out in it, to which he gives
<BR>
expression, which he disentangles, sets free,
<BR>
and interprets.&quot;  (1879)
<BR>
<P>This might be reworded to read:  &quot;Art is reality as the artist's mind sees
<BR>
it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This view, quite similar to that of Kenyon Cox's notion that different art
<BR>
forms and works expose different orders of truth (see his essay &quot;What is
<BR>
Painting?&quot;; I reviewed some of Cox's ideas at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/Kenyon.html">http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/Kenyon.html</A>) and, even, Rand's view of
<BR>
art.  (I had to bring her into the mix -- merely because I'm most familiar
<BR>
with her views.:)  In the views of these people, the artistic imagination
<BR>
reveals when it creates.  This is in some ways much like the Ancient view of
<BR>
mimesis -- of art as imitation.
<BR>
<P>My additional two cents!
