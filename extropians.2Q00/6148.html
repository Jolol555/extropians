<EM>&gt; Quantum Money (1)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whenever money is earning interest in a bank it is no longer perfectly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liquid. The only time money is ever perfectly liquid is when it is being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spent. This is the quantum approach. The quantum definition of money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basically says that money only appears infinitesimally at the moment of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; payment, and therefore, there really is no such thing as the quantity of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money.
</EM><BR>
<P>I find this to be rather erroneous. For example, there has to be some
<BR>
mass of money to attain a certain probability of spending x amount of
<BR>
money, based upon economic conditions. Measurements of the quantity of
<BR>
money account for not only this mass of money, but the economic
<BR>
conditions that influence the probability of x amount being spent at any
<BR>
one time.
<BR>
<P>The incidence by which money is spent is not the quantity of money, but
<BR>
the velocity of money. The relationship between the two is a matter of
<BR>
integration.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Quantum Money (2)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To encrypt, send a photon to the remote site, entangled with one at home. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your enemy detects the entangled photon, it can¹t be sent again, entangled,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because of quantum principles. Then send the message photon, and read it by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teleportantion with the entangled photon. Similarly, you can make quantum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money that cannot be counterfeited. This was invented by a Columbia student,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Stephen Wiesner many years ago, and received more notice recently with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rise of quantum communications and computing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, the new methods of quantum encryption do promise to end the control
<BR>
of BB over once and for all, however, they are not so necessary, yet.
<BR>
For example, PGP has as a standard feature a randomization function,
<BR>
such that an 'enemy' listening in cannot determine if what he is
<BR>
'hearing' is data or merely static. Knowing that what you are seeing is
<BR>
in fact data is the first step in penetrating any encryption
<BR>
methodology, and putting the burden on the eavesdropper to consider all
<BR>
static as 'data' increase his cost of doing business and delays his
<BR>
ability to act on any information he may derive from it. If the statute
<BR>
of limitations is 7 years, and you can encrypt enough to keep the
<BR>
government supercomputers humming for at least that long, then you are
<BR>
home free. That is the measure of practical optimal encryption. Current
<BR>
elliptical encryption methodologies seem to indicate that they can
<BR>
attain practical 'perfect' encryption (i.e. it would take longer than
<BR>
the life of the universe to crack). In the middle, the longest
<BR>
marketable strength of encryption is that which is uncrackable for the
<BR>
entire life of the participants. Even assuming medical immortality, that
<BR>
still imposes an average 4400 year life span due to irretreivable
<BR>
accidents. Take the life expectancy of the 99th percentile of a
<BR>
medically immortal population and you have your absolute largest
<BR>
marketable strength needed.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Quantum Money (3)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Was invented, long time ago, by a famous neapolitan comedy writer, Eduardo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; De Filippo (see: Il Sindaco di Rione Sanità). It is a sort of virtual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superposition of debts and credits. In his famous comedy no one gets real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money Š
</EM><BR>
<P>'What is 'real money'?' is a better question. Define it. Essentially,
<BR>
anything that acts like money is money, there is no such thing as
<BR>
'unreal money', because money in and of itself is merely a symbol.
<BR>
Anything that is functionally the same as that symbol is, in fact, that
<BR>
symbol.
