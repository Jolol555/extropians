<EM> &gt; Anyway, one comment, in case someone hasn't brought it up.  Imagine,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; ubiquitous surveillance is just around the corner, what things do you
</EM><BR>
think
<BR>
<EM> &gt; would be used to counteract it?  There're always ways to fake out any
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's my scenario, culled from various sources including Vinge's 1998
<BR>
CFP talk on ubitiquous law enforcement (ULE).
<BR>
<P>First, in order to prevent innocent computers from being used as
<BR>
zombies in distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, the gov't
<BR>
mandates a new chip to be emplaced in any computers. Well, actually
<BR>
it's not mandated, just a requirement to get your Internet access
<BR>
license.
<BR>
<P>These chips are immediately hacked and found to transmit information
<BR>
about the sites you visit and all sorts of other things (unlicensed
<BR>
software installations, etc) which of course the gov't redistributes
<BR>
to favored corporations (Real, Yahoo, whatever).
<BR>
<P>As per Vinge, a War On Drugs scale repression sets in as the gov't
<BR>
attempts to stop hacking of these devices. ULE technology grows, and
<BR>
after a while everything piece of technology you use is a gov't
<BR>
informer. Hacking moves to the nano scale.
<BR>
<P>Another few years and the new thing is BrainNet, where people can
<BR>
get linked up to each other using Kurzweil's brain-roving nanobots.
<BR>
Technological telepathy allows BrainNet-connected people to be much
<BR>
much more efficient and if you're not on BrainNet it's like not being
<BR>
on the Internet today.
<BR>
<P>After a couple incidents where sleeping people are used as zombies
<BR>
to perform Scanners-like attacks on others, and having established
<BR>
precedent with the anti-DDOS measures, the gov't mandates that anyone
<BR>
who wants to get a BrainNet access license has to have federal police
<BR>
nanobots installed in their brains. Again, this isn't required, just
<BR>
required if you want to access BrainNet. The policeman within becomes
<BR>
the legal system within.
<BR>
<P>Of course these internal nanoFedbots report on far more than your
<BR>
attempts to hack ULE components, and resulting market research data
<BR>
is again made available to favored corporations. People begin to use
<BR>
their own brain-roving nanobots against the nanoFedbots.
<BR>
<P>Now, the nanoFedbots having been made from NSA technology superior
<BR>
to what one can get commercially, your own nanobots are no match
<BR>
against them unless you devote conscious effort to develop tactics
<BR>
and strategy and lead them into battle. You can spot people engaged
<BR>
in battles with the nanoFedbots by the faint puffs of smoke coming
<BR>
out of their ears as the nanobots make war on each other.
<BR>
<P>So, that's it! Instead of a global nanowar, we all have an internal
<BR>
nanowar inside our own brains! What fun!
