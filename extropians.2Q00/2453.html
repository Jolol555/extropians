<EM>&gt;&gt;... I have always refused to submit any of my MVT (Median Vision Theory)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;material to any academic journals ..... mainly because they don't pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;much but expect all the reproduction rights. Since I am not a &quot;career
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;academic&quot; publishing in these journals and playing the silly game you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;detail, always seemed pointless to me. I prefer to retain my own
</EM><BR>
copyrights.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;...In my case, MVT offers a solution to the hard/ mind problem in
</EM><BR>
philosophy,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;which reduces all the second-order theorising and &quot;made-up names&quot; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;comprises the &quot;Analytic&quot; school of philosophy. Academics want to
</EM><BR>
perpetuate
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;problems, not solve them ... it simply isn't in their interest to shorten
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;their &quot;philosopher's debate.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It seems to me that you *are* playing in the academic game, even if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't realize it.
</EM><BR>
<P>But the point is whose rules .... I am outside the academic journal loop, so
<BR>
might be said to playing *against* the academic game rather than in it. I
<BR>
aim for a big inter-theoretic reduction that will shake-up many academics.
<BR>
<P>Academia has succeeded across many centuries as remaining
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the most authoritative source people turn to when asking abstract
</EM><BR>
questions.
<BR>
<P>Along with the various Churches &amp;c, yes, it has been the &quot;establishment&quot; in
<BR>
the human-era past, but with the post-human age will not necessarily
<BR>
continue to have authority. It must earn this authority constantly by being
<BR>
&quot;correct.&quot;
<BR>
<P>... if academics are wrong surely they forfeit authority?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You can see this by seeing who reporters ask, or policy makers ask, when
</EM><BR>
they
<BR>
<EM>&gt;want to ask a question about an area they don't know very well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which makes a different point that maybe the *reporters* are the
<BR>
idea-formers ... I am certainly going the TV route with my new MVT
<BR>
documentary ... although I do include interviews with prominent academics in
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;And you
<BR>
<EM>&gt;can see by who people give money to in order to help abstract questions get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;better answered.
</EM><BR>
<P>They can get it for free off the internet maybe ....
<BR>
<P>Although we might think we see lots of inefficiencies in
<BR>
<EM>&gt;how it works, we must acknowledge that it has so far beat most competitors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hands down in the niche it competes for.
</EM><BR>
<P>What competitors are you talking about here? Academia only seems to compete
<BR>
amongst itself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you are trying to convince the world you have a better approach to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mind body question, you are most certainly competing most directly with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;academics.  You may be choosing a different strategy from they, but you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are playing the same game: convincing people you are an authority on an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;abstract topic.
</EM><BR>
<P>I prefer to develop  (and use) applications developed from MVT to change
<BR>
people's minds by pointing to the benefits that could accrue to them from
<BR>
using MVT-based applications  ..... authority (as I have learnt from my
<BR>
hypnotherapy theory and practise) comes from *congruence* not by virtue any
<BR>
formal academic position.
