<EM>&gt; &gt; Given Mother Theresa openly _professed_ views on human suffering --
</EM><BR>
about
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; its necessity; i.e., the necessity of it in the form of the stifling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poverty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and rampant disease in Third World countries and not in the sense of,
</EM><BR>
say,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; needing a little adversity to make us stronger -- I'd think there's a
</EM><BR>
high
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cost associated with even one Mother Theresa.  If ever there was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; character
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that seems almost out of a Rand novel, it is her.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not sure I understand this point. Could you expand on it? Type slowly,
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have trouble keeping up...
</EM><BR>
<P>See <A HREF="http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/hitchens_16_4.html">http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/hitchens_16_4.html</A>
<BR>
<P>I recall this being stated elsewhere on TV news several years ago, though
<BR>
approvingly.  I've checked some of the Mother Theresa web sites, but have
<BR>
not found the exact quote.
<BR>
<P>There are also several other sites critical of her.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Since Gates has yet to use or advocate murder and mayhem or even to show
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bias toward such, I disagree.  (This is not to put Gates on a pedestal.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm talking economically here; rather than actually physically killing
</EM><BR>
each
<BR>
<EM>&gt; other, 100 Bill Gates could be expected to spend a lot of effort trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economically dominate each other, using (not exclusively) extremely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destructive competitive practices, in an attempt to gain a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; position.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure if this would be the case.  After all, Gates is finite and he's
<BR>
really only trying to be on top in one industry.  Would they all decide to
<BR>
stick to the same industry?  If so, would 100 Mother Theresa's all compete
<BR>
to help the same beggar and not divide their efforts?
<BR>
<P>Also, trying to be the best usually winds up making people do better things
<BR>
anyhow.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another point of view is that most of the value of both Bill Gates and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mother Theresa is as icons; they symbolise particular sets of values to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great amounts of people. From this point of view, 100 of either is only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; marginally more useful than one; those instances occuring after the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not carrying any extra symbolic value.
</EM><BR>
<P>As icons, I gather Emlyn is right -- if we assume everyone can agree and
<BR>
believe in the same set of icons.
<BR>
<P>This is a good angle to examine Mother Theresa from, since most people
<BR>
consider her morally perfect and above reproach.  She appeared to do lots of
<BR>
things for PR and a lot of things she did -- supporting Duvalier -- and said
<BR>
which went uncriticized, but if others had did or said them -- let's say,
<BR>
Bill Gates had said them would not be praised at all.
<BR>
<P>In a way, it reminds me of McCain's campaign to become the GOP Presidential
<BR>
candidate.  As a senator he never met a lobbyist he didn't like, but as a
<BR>
candidate for the Presidential ticket he took every chance he could get for
<BR>
photo ops to make him look like the common man, unconnected to the
<BR>
Washington set.  And the hagiography continues!
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
