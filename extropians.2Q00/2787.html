<EM>&gt; I think that's oversimplifying my view...  I believed that you had the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goal, but I believed that you had different reasons for having the goal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than you actually did.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed, I did oversimplify your view, and your description is more accurate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The reasons why someone would be interested in this question are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simple.  You might be thinking about performing a destructive upload
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (especially if that's the only option available).
</EM><BR>
<P>This is exactly my purpose for participating in these discussions.  Most
<BR>
uploading plans described on this list are destructive.  I want to make sure
<BR>
that the destructiveness isn't aimed at the parts I'm trying to save.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One reason why someone might be comfortable with all of these is if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they believe that they are their own copy set, rather than their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness stream or their atoms.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  A very important side-point here is that there are three belief
<BR>
systems on this issue, not just two.  (&quot;I am my atoms&quot;, &quot;I am one
<BR>
consciousness stream&quot;, &quot;I am many consciousness streams&quot;).  I have
<BR>
frequently been lumped into the wrong category while the other two
<BR>
viewpoints were being debated.  Each side assumed that I was on the other
<BR>
side.  I wonder how often this confusion has disrupted these kinds of
<BR>
threads.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However...  According to your own definition of &quot;you,&quot; Harvey, &quot;you&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are almost certain to die.  Simple medical immortality is not enough;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually, if you're not careful, you'll get caught in an accident of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficient magnitude that &quot;you&quot; will not be able to recover, no matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how advanced the medical science is.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is my primary concern as well.  Most of the destructive techniques for
<BR>
uploading will destroy the stuff I'm trying to save.  I would love to use
<BR>
these methods, but none of the explanations have convinced me to bet my
<BR>
life.
<BR>
<P>I've cut out the rest of your post to save space.  I agree with you in that
<BR>
I might consider destructively copying myself if my death is imminent, and
<BR>
cryonic preservation were not possible.  I plan to put off that decision as
<BR>
long as possible, and find it to be poor alternative to not dying in the
<BR>
first place.  (Remember that I would view my copy as a kind of cloned
<BR>
offspring, and not a continuation of myself.)
