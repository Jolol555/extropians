<P>...
<BR>
<EM> &gt; On the other hand, at 9 days into the 1929 series above the index was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; down 30%, while NASDAQ is only down 20% over the previous nine days.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; That's a pretty significant difference, especially in terms of market
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; psychology.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that the current situation is not like 1929- today's bubblicious
<BR>
stock mania, massive credit creation excesses, consumer and corporate
<BR>
debt loads, current account deficit, real estate inflation, surreal
<BR>
government statistics, fraudulent accounting practices in technology
<BR>
firms like Lucent, Intel, IBM, Microsoft, etc., gold banking implosion-
<BR>
in-the-making, bank derivatives exposures (ala LTCM writ large), and
<BR>
so forth ad nauseum make the crash/depression of 1929-1939 look like a speed
<BR>
bump.
<BR>
<P><P><EM> &gt; Also, although the NASDAQ gets a lot of publicity, the Dow
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; industrials have not followed the above pattern very closely at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The Dow is down only about 4% over the last two weeks.  Those big
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; industrial companies add inertia and stability to the economy as a whole.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; 6.     Are all the contrarian signs there for a meltdown in the 
</EM><BR>
broader tech
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; groups?  YES   History shows that there has NEVER been an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; instance where a financial mania or asset bubble has ended in any way 
</EM><BR>
other than
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; badly.  There are no soft landings for asset bubbles.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Two things: first, it's not clear that this is an asset bubble.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that is Federal Reserve Corporation's party line. It is
<BR>
all you will hear on their media. Let's have a look:

<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; People
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; are trading in these companies in the hope of near-term gains, yes.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; But underlying these hopes, investors see long-term prospects for future
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; technology growth.  Those companies that are blazing the trail into
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; new technologies are the ones which investors hope will be the market
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; leaders of tomorrow.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hope.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Calling it an asset bubble is really a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; second-guessing the market, the collective opinions of all those people
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; investing out there.  That's not an easy trick to pull off.
</EM><BR>
<P>I find it rather simple. If a company loses money consistently (amazon.com,
<BR>
biotech.com), cooks the books (Lucent, Microstrategy, etc.), has a P/E
<BR>
in the hundreds or thousands (Yahoo!, Cisco, MSFT, etc.)- meaning it
<BR>
will require hundreds or thousands of years to pay for itself, then
<BR>
that company is grotesquely overvalued.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Second, as far as hard landings: through most of history there has not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; been the understanding that we have today of macroeconomics.
</EM><BR>
<P>In our vast understanding of macroeconomics we have lost sight of something
<BR>
rather fundamental: What is money? Let us ask our master:
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to a question by Congressman Ron Paul (Rep., Tex.), Federal
<BR>
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan spoke to the subject of the  nation's
<BR>
money in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on February 17, 2000:
<BR>
<P>Alan Greenspan:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; By definition, all prices are indeed the &quot;ratio of an exchange
<BR>
of a good for money.&quot; And what we seek is what that is. Our problem
<BR>
is we used M-1 at one point as the proxy of money, and it turned
<BR>
out to be a very difficult indicator of any financial state. We
<BR>
then went to M-2 and had the similar problem. We have never done
<BR>
M-3 per se because it largely reflects the extent of expansion of
<BR>
the banking industry. And when in effect banks expand, in and of
<BR>
itself, it doesn't tell you terribly much about what real money is.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;  So our problem is not that we do not believe in sound
<BR>
money. We do. We very much believe that, if you have a debased currency,
<BR>
that you will have a debased economy. The difficulty is in defining
<BR>
what part of our liquidity structure is truly money.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had trouble ferreting out proxies for that for a number of
<BR>
years. And the standard we employed is whether it gives us a good
<BR>
forward indicator of the direction of finance and the economy.
<BR>
<P>&quot;  Regrettably, none of those which we have been able to develop,
<BR>
including MZM -- has done that. That does not mean that we think
<BR>
that money is irrelevant. It means we think our measures of money
<BR>
have been inadequate. And, as a consequence of that, we, as I have
<BR>
mentioned previously, have downgraded the use of the monetary
<BR>
aggregates for monetary policy  purposes, until we are able to
<BR>
find a more stable proxy for what we believe is the underlying
<BR>
money in the economy.
<BR>
<P>Question by Dr. Paul: &quot;So it's hard to manage something you can't define?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Answer by Mr. Greenspan: &quot;It is not possible to manage something you can't
<BR>
define.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><EM> &gt; Yes, there
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; is still much to be learned, and people do not always behave predictably.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mobs, such as the 50% of American households invested in the stock market,
<BR>
(as opposed to 12% in 1929) are fairly predictable, not as to timing,
<BR>
but as to reaction. They *will* panic.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; But at the same time we can't deny the effectiveness of the US Federal
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Reserve over the last two decades in moderating the business cycle and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; keeping the economy on a generally even keel.
</EM><BR>
<P>This sounds so much like the rhetoric of the late '20's that you
<BR>
frighten me. Do you work for the Federal Reserve System?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Stock prices may fall and even crash eventually, but we should not expect
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; a 1930s style depression as a result.  The economic policy mistakes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of the time are well understood today.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I agree. And those 'mistakes' have been repeated in spades. This
<BR>
is what makes the current period so similar to the Twenties. It is as
<BR>
if the '20's were a test of how to jerk around an entire economy
<BR>
and leave the bankers seated when the music stops. As for whether this
<BR>
leads to depression, that is entirely up to our owners- the Fed.
<BR>
<P><P><EM> &gt; There may be a slowdown as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the excesses of the boom times get cleared from the system, but there
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; is no reason to expect it to be particularly severe or long lasting.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The demographic factors which are driving investment today will remain,
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh? In the US? It will require 2 workers just to support each Social
<BR>
Security recipient within ~ 20 years, if there still is SSI, which I doubt.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; and progress in new technologies will not stop.  There is still every
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; reason to expect significant, possibly unprecedented, economic growth
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; over the next few decades, based on technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, there will be unprecedented growth- just not in the US.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Ultimately that can
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; support very high valuations.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; 7.     Is the stock market rational?   From a long term perspective, 
</EM><BR>
the answer
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; is YES.   Short term movements are anything but rational.   The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; market is an exercise in crowd behavior.  Today, it is simply an 
</EM><BR>
online study in
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; human nature.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; What is &quot;short term&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>The past five years and the next few months.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; The stock market has been overvalued by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; conventional measures for years.  Fed chairman Greenspan started
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; expressing alarm about 1995.
</EM><BR>
<P>And then proceeded to create &quot;money&quot; at historically unprecedented
<BR>
rates, thus feeding the bubble.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; It's tough to square allegiance to market
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; rationality with the belief that for 5+ years the market has been
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; foolishly caught up in an asset bubble.
</EM><BR>
<P>The current market players include a vast number of irrational suckers
<BR>
caught up in what they consider to be a casino, one in which a
<BR>
&quot;greater fool&quot; will always be on hand to purchase their worthless stock.
<BR>
<P>My position on this, though correct, is not a pleasant one
<BR>
to be in. I hope that this has helped someone out there.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The fate of the world economy is now totally dependent on the
<BR>
stock market, whose growth is dependent on about 50 stocks, half
<BR>
of which have never reported any earnings.&quot;
