<EM>&gt; &quot;Enter the Zone&quot;...the other is an offshoot &quot;A week in the zone'.

<EM>&gt; It's a diet....

<EM>&gt; Does anyone know anything about it?

<P>Been doing the zone thing for 4 years.  Heard about the Zone and &quot;Protein
<BR>
Power&quot; (book by Michael R. Eades and Mary Dan Eades).
<BR>
<P>I hesitate to call it a &quot;diet&quot;, at least in my case.  It seems to me diets
<BR>
are doomed to failure in that you go off them, and then probably lose the
<BR>
benefits.  I don't plan on going off of it, so I say I've changed the way I
<BR>
eat, and hope to remain on this kick unless persuaded otherwise.
<BR>
<P>Some characterize it as a high protein, low carb diet, but that is not
<BR>
accurate.  The zone promotes a 40-30-30 ratio (carbs - protein - fat as %
<BR>
of calories), so carbs constitute more of your meal than either protein or
<BR>
fat; but you strive to consume low-glycemic index carbs, like vegtables,
<BR>
and less concentrated, refined carbs, such as pasta, rice, potatoes, bread,
<BR>
sugar.  And not high-protein, adequate protein.  They encourage you to
<BR>
figure your lean body mass, and to eat protein adequate to sustain that.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From that protein need you figure the other diet macros, carbs and fat,
</EM><BR>
trying to maintain 40-30-30 ratio.
<BR>
<P>By making lean protein the cornerstone of your meals, your body reduces its
<BR>
output of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that prevents fat cells from
<BR>
releasing their contents to burn for energy, and causes cells to store
<BR>
additional fat. Protein, on the other hand,
<BR>
stimulates the release of insulin’s opposite hormone, glucagon, which
<BR>
signals the cells to release stored bodyfat.
<BR>
<P>If you find yourself losing fat while starting the zone, be aware that if
<BR>
you get rid of water your body dumps salts in order to maintain a proper
<BR>
ratio.  I experienced the leg cramps the book warns about, and so I got
<BR>
some &quot;no salt&quot; to replenish the potasium salts that the body dumps along
<BR>
with the sodium.
<BR>
<P>I also got some ketone strips, as beginning the zone usually promotes mild
<BR>
ketosis. Good idea to keep an eye on that.
<BR>
<P>My wife is a type 1 insulin dependent diabetic, and I had been aware in the
<BR>
past of an argument that diabetics in particular could benefit from a low
<BR>
complex-carb diet.  As I understand it (and from my wife's experience),
<BR>
complex carbs spike your blood sugar, and necessitate more insulin.
<BR>
Figuring your insulin needs when you have to inject it rather than counting
<BR>
on your body to release it as needed is tricky (your activity level needs
<BR>
to be factored in).  So if you are an injection dependent diabetic and you
<BR>
eat a high carb meal, you have to inject more insulin to cover the carb
<BR>
spike.  If you don't figure it right, that much insulin could crash you.
<BR>
Eating a Zone favorable, or lower glycemic meal, results in a much lower
<BR>
elevation of the blood sugar. With a lower dose of insulin, the type 1
<BR>
diabetic will have less chance of a hypoglycemic episode. A lower insulin
<BR>
dosage also can slow the progression of atherosclerosis, as well as other
<BR>
progressive diseases associated with insulin use--hypertension, obesity,
<BR>
high total cholesterol and triglycerides, and low HDL cholesterol.
<BR>
<P>The need for insulin drops dramatically after starting the Zone Diet. On
<BR>
average, insulin requirements will drop by 50% in the first week! All
<BR>
diabetics taking insulin should discuss the ZonePerfect Nutrition Program
<BR>
with their physician so that a sliding scale for the insulin dosage can be
<BR>
prescribed.
<BR>
<P>People taking oral diabetic medications may also need prompt dosage
<BR>
adjustments by their physician. Watch out for the &quot;shakes&quot;, irritability,
<BR>
lightheadedness, anxiety, perspiration, and nausea—these may be symptoms of
<BR>
hypoglycemia or low blood sugar levels. If you do experience any of these
<BR>
symptoms, immediately contact your physician. Adjustments may be needed in
<BR>
your medication. Remember following a Zone-favorable diet, your blood sugar
<BR>
will not rise as high. Therefore, you will require less insulin to maintain
<BR>
a normal blood sugar level.
<BR>
<P>Pardon the digression, but living daily with the dramatic effects of
<BR>
insulin makes you want to point these effects out.
<BR>
<P>I like the zone.  I do miss the pasta.  So if I find myself at a spagetti
<BR>
dinner, I try to eat less pasta, more meatballs or whatever protein, more
<BR>
salad.  Try to pass on the bread and potatoes.
<BR>
<P>I usually eat eggs for breakfast; tuna salad (no bread) for lunch; fish or
<BR>
chicken or meat with salad and veges for dinner. Avoid the sugar and
<BR>
pastries.  Pretty easy for me.  Others don't like it as much, they miss the
<BR>
carbs.
<BR>
<P>The book predicted that the zone diet would dramatically lower my
<BR>
triglycerides, raise my HDL, lower LDL and total cholesterol.  It did all
<BR>
three, but this is based on a very limited number of tests.
<BR>
<P>Good luck in the Zone.
<BR>
<P>Best Regards,
<BR>
