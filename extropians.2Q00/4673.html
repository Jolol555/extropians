From: &quot;altamira&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:altamira@ecpi.com?Subject=Re:%20Investing&In-Reply-To=&lt;200006081524.IAA28213@well.com&gt;">altamira@ecpi.com</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt;In the chart you link to, the bonds are long term and were subject
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to more years of inflation than deflation during the years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;covered.  This would not be the case with the strategy I suggested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of buying only short term bonds. I agree that T-bills are not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good investment for the long term.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As the standard deviations for the 3 asset classes indicate, stock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;returns are far more volatile than returns on bonds.  If you take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a smaller assortment of stocks, which is what most people end up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with, the volatility will be even greater.  Most people, if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;purchase stocks for their own portfolios, can't afford to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;diversify widely, and mutual fund managers don't seem to have all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that good of a track record. Some volatility wouldn't hurt if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were prepared to hang on for the long term, it's true.  And a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person could transfer their money out of stocks and into bonds at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;retirement age when they want to withdraw money periodically. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what if a person reached retirement age just as the market went
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into a slump of several years'duration? Also, some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;volatility which appears negligible on a chart translates into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rather severe losses for the individual investor.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Your info comes closer to changing my mind than other stuff I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seen, Rob, but I'd still feel queasy advising someone to put their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life savings into the stockmarket.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Hey Bonnie,
<BR>
<P>The original numbers I quoted were from one of Peter Lynch's books.
<BR>
The Motley fool usually uses 10.5% as it's number. I couldn't find
<BR>
the data easily on a quick pass through the Fool website, the
<BR>
numbers I'm looking for are on the very page of the &quot;Motley Fool
<BR>
Guide To Investing&quot; I was reading this morning, but unfortunately
<BR>
I left it at home.
<BR>
<P>A quick web search did turn up these numbers: Stock Market 1926-
<BR>
1999 average 11.3% annually from:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;www.vanguard.com/educ/lib/plain/stocks.html
<BR>
<P>One heuristic for a balanced portfolio goes like this:
<BR>
<P>Agressive investor:    120 - age = percent invested in stock 
<BR>
Moderate  Investor:    110 - age = percent invested in stock
<BR>
Conservative Investor: 100 - age = percent invested in stock
<BR>
<P>other common rules:
<BR>
<P>1) Pay off non-deductable debt first, 0% credit card balances.
<BR>
2) Have a month to a years expenses in a money market account/    
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short term investment vehicles (T-bills etc)
<BR>
3) Don't put anything in the market you're going to need in the   
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;next three years. (others suggest 5)
<BR>
<P>Most of what I have invested currently (I'm at step 1&amp;2) is in a
<BR>
tax-deferred equity fund thats part of a Union benefits package. We
<BR>
have a limited number of choices, but I have 100% invested in a S&amp;P
<BR>
Index fund. (better long term than the so called &quot;growth&quot; fund.)
<BR>
<P>Putting my money where my mouth is.  (Go Lakers, $100 short term
<BR>
investment)
