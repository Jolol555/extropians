<P>&lt;&lt; Sean Kenny's post got me thinking and I wanted to share something
<BR>
&nbsp;with you all.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Nov I was just finishing up a serious weight lifting session
<BR>
&nbsp;when I started feeling really lousy. I had been diagnosed with GERD
<BR>
&nbsp;three months prior which led to the very extropian decision to give
<BR>
&nbsp;up alcohol period.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway I was experiencing classic head-to-the-ER symptoms which I
<BR>
&nbsp;tried to ignore because I figured it was the GERD acting up. The
<BR>
&nbsp;next morning I still felt lousy, cursed myself for being stupid,
<BR>
&nbsp;and headed to the ER. I got to spend the next 24 hours as a guest,
<BR>
&nbsp;went through standard cardiac enzyme series tests and a treadmill
<BR>
&nbsp;stress-test. (all negative) An endoscope exam a few weeks ago
<BR>
&nbsp;revealed a bad case of antral gastritis, getting better every day.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My point? Even exercising regularly. eating right, and a state of
<BR>
&nbsp;the art vitamin/antioxident protocol is no guarantee. I hadn't been
<BR>
&nbsp;to the doctor in years. Now it's going to be an annual event.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;GERD has symptoms that will completely convince you that you are
<BR>
&nbsp;having a heart attack. Ever since I've been carrying what I call my
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;extropian amulet&quot;. Its a small stainless steel cylinder designed
<BR>
&nbsp;for heart patients to carry a nitro tab around in, mine contains a
<BR>
&nbsp;couple of baby aspirin, just in case. It is attached to my keyring,
<BR>
&nbsp;is tiny, and unobtrusive.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a bad idea at all, and unlike most amulets this one has real
<BR>
&nbsp;protective powers.....

<P>Brian,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your post.  I guess you have put your finger on something 
<BR>
that has been bothering me.  Is this site strictly about discussions of how 
<BR>
to terraform Mars and similar but non-immediate problems or is there anyone, 
<BR>
like me, interested in discussing how to live long enough to get there with 
<BR>
the youth and wealth to enjoy it?  I don't think the two discussions are 
<BR>
mutually exclusive: they are both important and IMHO equally fascinating.  Or 
<BR>
to open the discussion still wider; am I asking my questions in the wrong 
<BR>
arena?  Is there another site that I should be addressing?
<BR>
