<P>Re: great insights, ala Moravec and perhaps Tipler...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Very few and very far between is the apparent answer. 
</EM><BR>
<P>True.  Progress may be nothing more than good (random) minds noticing
<BR>
the appropriate (or perhaps false) patterns.  I had an interesting
<BR>
insight today (while commenting on a paper Robert Freitas had
<BR>
sent me for review) into the rate at which assemblers may work
<BR>
based on the necessity of avoiding information erasure in in computing
<BR>
(reversible vs. non-reversible computation).  What do nanoassembly
<BR>
and reversible computing have in common?  Not much, other than the
<BR>
fact that I've read alot about both and there may be some really
<BR>
interesting underlying principles in common regarding the physics
<BR>
of &quot;information processing&quot;.  I doubt I ever would have had this
<BR>
insight had I not been fortunate enough to be reviewing this
<BR>
particular paper with the background I've accumulated over the
<BR>
last couple of years.  Odds of their being many such strange
<BR>
insights that occur when interesting branches of knowledge cross?
<BR>
Pretty high I'm afraid, so it becomes a question of simply how
<BR>
many individuals are &quot;cross-trained&quot;, and that number would seem
<BR>
to be pretty small.  [It would appear though from current progress in
<BR>
genomics, requiring both molecular biology and computer science
<BR>
experience and the recent commentary in Science on the educational
<BR>
needs of the nanotechnology initiative, that more people are coming
<BR>
to this conclusion.]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would say and will say, that there has to be a critical mass for this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular philosophy to takeoff. Moreover, there has to be a qualitative 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impetus for this movement to sustain itself and succeed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not so sure I'd agree.  Gravity and evolution have both worked
<BR>
fine for billions of years with no intervention required... &quot;Look,
<BR>
Ma, no hands...&quot;.  The question in my mind and many others is can
<BR>
we put our hands on the handle bars to steer more effeciently and
<BR>
still manage to see far enough ahead to avoid hitting some really deep
<BR>
potholes (including those that may be dug by the less foresightful).
<BR>
<P>In that respect, and, in the vein of Brent's post, it is up to
<BR>
each of us to cleverly determine those who would eventually grab
<BR>
the handle bars and help them reach that point sooner and not gloat
<BR>
excessively as we steer around those who fell into the holes.
<BR>
There, but for the whims of the galactic overlords, go us.
