<EM>&gt; No time to comment on everything this morning, but the above point of view
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clearly means Lorrey means anything and everything can be redefined as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; military target.  In other words, any war is always total war and any
</EM><BR>
nation
<BR>
<EM>&gt; engaging in war that thinks it has right on its side -- and what nation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to war claims it doesn't -- can bomb and kill indiscriminately.
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the unpleasant realities of real wars (as opposed to minor border
<BR>
skirmishes and whitewashed histories) is that the supposed rules of war are
<BR>
simply a propaganda tool. They are respected when nothing important is at
<BR>
stake, or when it looks like there is a good opportunity for positive press.
<BR>
However, when in major wars where millions of lives are at stake they are
<BR>
quite properly jettisoned at need.
<BR>
<P>It seems reasonable to judge American conduct in the Balkans, or even the
<BR>
Gulf War, by the standards of 'civilized warfare', since in both cases
<BR>
America was not actually at risk and was simply enforcing foreign policy
<BR>
decisions using military power. However, WWI and WWII are another kettle of
<BR>
fish - in a real war there is no such thing as a non-military target, and
<BR>
preserving millions of your own civilians takes precedence over trying not
<BR>
to kill conscientious objectors on the other side.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The Soviets actually asked the British and Americans to target the city.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tens of thousands were killed.  The military targets in Dresden were road
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and rail centers.  In order to minimize civilian and refugee deaths, all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that would have been necessary was targeting these outside the city.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bombing took place in February of 1945.  The war ended a few months later.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This was not material to ending the war -- any more than turning over
</EM><BR>
people
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to the Soviets after the war was material to keeping the peace.
</EM><BR>
<P>In WWII it was not possible for strategic bombers to target roads,
<BR>
railroads, or anything else much smaller than a football stadium - and
<BR>
really, if your target was smaller than a city you had to plan on lots and
<BR>
lots of misses. The only practical way to attack the transport net with
<BR>
strategic bombers was to carpet bomb the entire region around a railroad
<BR>
yard.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yugoslavia is interesting in another way.  The US had no vital interest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there.  It did not affect any US allies in a big way.  (If it did, why has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the trouble in the Balkans for the last ten years not bothered them?)
</EM><BR>
Also,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; US policy in the region has been markedly pro-Islamic and pro-German.  I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not trying to bring a conspiracy angle in here, but it's strange to see
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; US standing by while Croatia cleansed itself of Serbs by the tens of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousands, while not being able stand Serbia hold on to Kosovo and the
</EM><BR>
death
<BR>
<EM>&gt; toll being orders of magnitude smaller.  (Croatia is a nation which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; celebrates its alliance to Nazi Germany and exterminated approximately a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; third of its population during WW2.  This does NOT mean I'm prepared to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support a bombing campaign against Croatia TV and rail lines, civilians or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Here, I have to agree with you. It is hard to tell exactly what was really
<BR>
happening in Yugoslavia before American intervention, but it seems clear
<BR>
that most of what the American public has been told was exaggerated at best
<BR>
(and at worst an outright lie). We had nothing to gain by getting involved,
<BR>
and all our bombing campaign accomplished was to kill more people, create
<BR>
more confusion, and give another group of people a good reason to hate
<BR>
America.
<BR>
<P>This is a good example of what America should NOT be doing. You can't solve
<BR>
a longstanding ethnic or religious feud by waving the flag and bombing a few
<BR>
buildings, and you generally can't overthrow a dictator without sending in
<BR>
ground troops.
<BR>
<P>America (or at least its government) needs to realize that if you want an
<BR>
intervention to work you have to actually bit the bullet and do it right -
<BR>
send in ground troops, overthrow the dictator, set up a representative
<BR>
government, and keep troops in place for a couple of years until everyone
<BR>
gets used to the idea of peace. In some places (like the Balkans) even that
<BR>
isn't enough - we would have to resettle everyone at gunpoint, or send all
<BR>
the children to re-education camps, or something equally unpalatable. In
<BR>
such cases we need to learn to accept the fact that there simply isn't
<BR>
anything we can do to make the situation better, and be content with not
<BR>
making it worse.
