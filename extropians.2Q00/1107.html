<EM>&gt; &gt; That's why the appeal of the Harry Brown book TOTALLY lost me ... hearken to

<EM>&gt; &gt; a better life back then... How good life was before it all got interfered

<EM>&gt; &gt; with by those darn civl rights laws. Hogwash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; People are always going to whitewash the past. Remember how much better is

<EM>&gt; &gt; was ...? ... back in another time, a better, simpler America?  That rhetoric

<EM>&gt; &gt; only works if I lived in middle class, non-ethnic, as white male America,

<EM>&gt; &gt; Mike.  Things weren't so good for &quot;others&quot;.  Others have it better now, but

<EM>&gt; &gt; not much -- oh yes, and at a cost to the middle class non-ethnic, white male

<EM>&gt; &gt; America.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I know you have heard this before and discount it, but it's my POV.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't dispute that the non-high school graduates had it difficult, esp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minorities. I was commenting on how gicing the state (and therefore the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eductation monopoly union, the NEA) control of our schools has produces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a far lower quality product.
</EM><BR>
<P>I blame early mornings for my spelling..... and of course the NEA... ;)
