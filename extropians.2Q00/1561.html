I took my college girlfriend to a physics seminar featuring Carl Sagan's 
<BR>
Cosmos, because she thought Sagan was the most gorgeous man on two feet.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>My mother was also very fond of Sagan, though she did comment he must have 
<BR>
thought similarly about himself because the camera in Cosmos often showed 
<BR>
Sagan's profile for extended periods as he gazed in wonder at the universe!! 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read that Sagan was quite the ladies man.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
That changed both our lives: she soon threw me back for another guy who 
<BR>
looked more like Sagan, and I was led to study
<BR>
Steven Jay Gould, which led to Douglas Hofstadter's Escher Godel Bach, which 
<BR>
led me to realize that my religion and all religions I know of are self 
<BR>
referential systems, unverifiable. Changed my major from theology to 
<BR>
engineering. Atheists make poor ministers. spike

<BR>
<P>Think if you had both been prevented from going to that lecture!  You would 
<BR>
probably be a Unitarian minister right now, and they are generally not paid 
<BR>
well!  What denomination had you planned to go into?
<BR>
<P>My bestfriend attended a small, conservative Bible college in Decatur, 
<BR>
Georgia, lead by Earl Paulk.  He worked as he went doing landscaping to 
<BR>
avoid going into debt while there.  He did manage to get a bachelors in 
<BR>
pastoral studies but in his final year the dean and head minister (and his 
<BR>
ministerial younger brother) who were both married, were found to be having 
<BR>
affairs with their secretaries.
<BR>
<P>This created a major media scandal and my friend was mocked by people in the 
<BR>
community and at work.  The younger brother to the dean would rush the 
<BR>
cameras like he was going to hit someone and then verbally rage at the 
<BR>
reporters!  That only added to the media feeding frenzy.
<BR>
<P>About half of the church elders resigned and left because of the unrepentant 
<BR>
attitude of the dean and his brother.  The other half my friend said 'sold 
<BR>
out' and became yes men.  About a third of the congregation left also.  The 
<BR>
original spirit of the church died.
<BR>
<P>My friend attended this school because the head minister was a 'real man' 
<BR>
who had seen action in WW2.  He really enjoyed his taped sermons and decided 
<BR>
to go their to school after much thought.
<BR>
<P>Every year the students were told the school would be accredited but never 
<BR>
was.  He saw athletes who were allowed to get away with behavior that 
<BR>
regular students could not, because they were the basketball players who 
<BR>
would win games and gain glory for the school.  This really irked him no 
<BR>
end.
<BR>
<P>My friend got several offers to become a youth minister but he turned them 
<BR>
all down and came back to Alaska.  He had lost most of his faith in 
<BR>
Christian people which lead to lack of desire to remain a devout Christian.  
<BR>
He has floated around aimlessly in his life since this happened about a 
<BR>
decade ago.
<BR>
<P>I would love to bump into Earl Paulk, dean of a certain Earl Paulk Bible 
<BR>
college(and he named it after himself! lol) and tell him the effect he had 
<BR>
on my bestfriend's life.  Then I would dare him to visit my friend and beg 
<BR>
for forgiveness for having wounded his psyche in his formative years.  Then 
<BR>
he should spend about a year living with or near my friend and REALLY assist 
<BR>
him in all respects, if he really has any strength and goodness to give 
<BR>
anymore.
<BR>
<P><P>looking back,
<BR>
