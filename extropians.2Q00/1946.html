<EM>&gt; Predation is not a 'problem'. Its a solution. It weeds out the weak and

<EM>&gt; ill and aged. It is THE instrument of evolution.
</EM><BR>
<P>It WAS.  Biological evolution has no more place in the world.  The
<BR>
future belongs to intelligence, not genes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Predation IS nature at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work. Predation is most certainly NOT bloodthirsty.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, predators do thirst for blood.  They are, literally,
<BR>
bloodthirsty.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Predators do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kill more than they need to, and viciousness is a human sentiment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Animals are not concerned with being mean, or causing pain and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffering, they are interested in FOOD.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's true, but in the process they cause tremendous pain and suffering.
<BR>
The pain and suffering caused by animal predators throughout history
<BR>
far outweighs anything humans have experienced.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The only reason you don't feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same way about herbivores is that plants can't make noise to object
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they are eaten or flee from their consumers, even though studies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have shown that plants object just as much to being damaged or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destroyed. Eating plants versus eating animals is ethically no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different, both are harvesting the body of another living thing for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one's own sustenance.
</EM><BR>
<P>Plants don't have brains.  They are not conscious.  They are no more
<BR>
able to feel pain than a rock is.
