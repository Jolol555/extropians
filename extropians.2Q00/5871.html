<EM>&gt; Well it is an interesting quandry- if you are convinced that in the near
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future (less than 50 years) there will be technology available to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you near-immortal (with a copy of yourself on tape just in case :-) then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why take any risks at all during the current era? Is it the most rational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course of action to find the safest lifestyle and live accordingly?
</EM><BR>
<P>Robin pointed out that it depends on how much you are willing to sacrifice
<BR>
today for an additional year of life at some point in the future.
<BR>
Normally people consider benefits in the future to be worth less than
<BR>
benefits today.  If you offer someone a choice between a delicious meal
<BR>
five years from now or one today, they will prefer getting it today.
<BR>
<P>There are things you can do today to extend your lifespan even under
<BR>
current technology.  Avoid driving at night, eat certain foods, don't
<BR>
do any risky sports, and so on.  Yet most people are only willing to
<BR>
sacrifice so much.  This suggests that a year of life 30 or 50 years
<BR>
from now is only worth a limited amount to them today.
<BR>
<P>Even if there were things you could do to give you an infinite life
<BR>
span, this might not be of infinite value to you today.  The benefit
<BR>
of an additional year of life 300 or 1000 or 10000 years out is pretty
<BR>
hypothetical right now.  How much would it be worth today to have your
<BR>
lifespan increased from 10000 years to 10001?  It would be tough to
<BR>
justify much of a sacrifice for such a minor percentage increase so far
<BR>
out, yet it is an entire year of life.
<BR>
<P>A counterargument could be that we have hope and faith that our lives
<BR>
won't just be getting longer, but they will be getting better.  We will
<BR>
be able to improve ourselves, to broaden and deepen our minds, to enhance
<BR>
our bodies far beyond the limitations we face today.  If you combine
<BR>
infinite life with infinitely expanding quality of life, then you could
<BR>
argue that this expectation would have a truly infinite value today.
<BR>
In that case you could justify any sacrifice in order to increase your
<BR>
chances of experiencing that possibility.
<BR>
