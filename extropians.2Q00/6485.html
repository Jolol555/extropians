<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redmond, WA - Microsoft today filed papers in Federal District Court
<BR>
alleging that the United States Government is a monopoly. The papers allege
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the current government has stifled competition, and has prevented
<BR>
innovation in government, by using its monopoly power to pass laws prohibiting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the formation of another Federal government. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;American's don't have a choice in which army will protect them. They have
<BR>
no choice in who will collect their taxes. Less than 50% of the people even
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bother to vote because they know it won't make any difference.&quot; said Steve
<BR>
Ballmer. &quot;It's time that the US Government opened up to some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;competition, that would get people out to vote and wring out a lot of the
<BR>
inefficiencies.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft is solidly against splitting up the government saying it would
<BR>
cause too much harm to the public. They suggest letting Microsoft set up its own
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government and let the marketplace determine which government should rule.
<BR>
Bill Gates said, &quot;We already have more money than most governments
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around the world, and we have our own army.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On what a Microsoft government could do for the people Mr. Gates added,
<BR>
&quot;Talk about bloated code. Have you seen the tax laws? A Microsoft
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government would have a simpler tax code, and each citizen would be given a
<BR>
copy of Microsoft Money to help them track their finances.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coalition of companies headed by Sun Microsystems filed a brief shortly
<BR>
after Microsoft stating, &quot;If they get to form a government, we get to form a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Justice is expected to respond to the allegations within
<BR>
a week. It is expected that this case will reach the Supreme Court.
