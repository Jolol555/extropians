<P><EM>&gt;When I was younger, I used to like to go to a foreign country whose language
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I didn't know, taking with me only a couple of changes of clothes and enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;money to buy food &amp; lodging.  I found that it was a good way to find, sort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of, the essence of myself, apart from all my possessions and friends and my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;place&quot; in the society of which I was a part.  But I was always glad to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;return home.  The thought of being in a foreign time from which I couldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;return is a bit daunting.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm doing this now, but it's the same time period, not a future time travel
<BR>
and my total possessions are with me.
<BR>
<P>My &quot;place in society&quot;? Doesn't exist for me. I could walk into any
<BR>
place and act like a completely different person, and no one would
<BR>
know that it wasn't me, and there would be absolutely
<BR>
no repercussions. It's a (very) bizarre kind of freedom. It's even
<BR>
more bizarre operating at about a language understanding of 50%,
<BR>
like living every day as a partial deaf-mute.
<BR>
<P>My two best friends currently are a Greek and a German. I'm surrounded
<BR>
with Germans (mostly), and then Italians, Austrailians, French, British,
<BR>
Mexicans, Hungarians. My office-mate is Russian. There has been noone of
<BR>
my culture around me during the last 2 years. Sometimes it's hard to
<BR>
find my equilibrium being among so many unfamiliar cultures for so long.
<BR>
But people over history have done this during war times. And it could be
<BR>
more difficult. My father left his home country forever during WWII.
<BR>
Now I find that completely daunting.
