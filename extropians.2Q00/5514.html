<EM> &gt; If I ever write a post-singularity novel, my evil bad-guy is going
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to have an emulated planet of  kidnap-uploaded Amish, the way that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Blofeld had his cats or someone else might keep a fishtank in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; waiting room.   One of my rare evil notions.

<P>Hey, it's not so evil, if you consider some of the alternatives:
<BR>
disassembling this ball of dirt including adhering Amish biofilm due
<BR>
to exponential expansion pressure. Given how slow meatspace life will
<BR>
seem, and how unlikely a consensus is to emerge, perhaps hitting them,
<BR>
and upload them minus most recent short-time experiences would seem
<BR>
the most humane choice.
<BR>
<P>If posthumanity is about to gobble up the Earth instanter, survival of
<BR>
biology might be in hands of single individual. Heck, I wouldn't mind
<BR>
being a pet of a god. Rather god pet than dead.
