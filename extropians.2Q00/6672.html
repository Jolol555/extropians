<EM>&gt; Better still, of course, will be the (re)invention of local community and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fresh, non-destructive, satisfying ways for people without wage-earning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toil to spend their days. That's something I'd like to see more extropians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and transhumanists thinking hard about. But maybe real solutions will have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to bubble up emergently from within those moieties.
</EM><BR>
<P>Along those lines I'd like to mention one of the few books I keep on the
<BR>
shelf behind my desk, always close at hand:  _Permaculture: A Practical
<BR>
Guide for a Sustainable Future_ by Bill Mollison.  I'm seeing on this list,
<BR>
and many other places, highly intelligent people who can do a mind boggling
<BR>
assortment of complex tasks but who appear not to know very much about
<BR>
actually taking care of themselves.  (please don't get mad at me for saying
<BR>
this, I don't mean it as an insult)
<BR>
<P>I'd like to quote from Bill's book:  &quot;We know how to solve every food, clean
<BR>
energy, and sensible shelter problem in every climate; we have already
<BR>
invented and tested every necessary technique and technical device, and have
<BR>
access to all the biological material that we could ever use.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The tragic reality is that very few sustainable systems are designed or
<BR>
applied by those who hold power, and the reason for this is obvious and
<BR>
simple:  to let people arrange their own food, energy, and shelter is to
<BR>
lose economic and political control over them.  We should cease to look to
<BR>
power structures, hierarchical systems, or governments to help us, and
<BR>
devise ways to help ourselves.&quot;
<BR>
<P>When he says we have every technology necessary he's not advocating that we
<BR>
cease inventing new technologies.  He's saying to USE WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE.
<BR>
OK, I'm going to utter blasphemy:  there is no need for agribusiness.  The
<BR>
reason I don't like most of the GE research that's going on right now is not
<BR>
because I'm not fascinated by molecular genetics, not because I don't think
<BR>
that much good could come from it, but rather because the direction being
<BR>
taken is all wrong in most cases! The direction being taken is toward more
<BR>
agribusiness and more centralized control of the food supply and less
<BR>
control by the individual over his or her own life.  If someone else is
<BR>
controlling your food supply, they've got you by the huevos, no matter what
<BR>
you call the system you're living under.
<BR>
<P>I've said this before, but since it's so far from what most of us are taught
<BR>
to believe, I'll risk being boring by saying it again:  growing your food
<BR>
need not take more time than going to the grocery store and buying the food.
<BR>
It takes far less time and energy over all to grow your food than to buy it
<BR>
when you add in the cost of the farm equipment, the fuel to run it, the
<BR>
farmer's time, the truck driver's time, the processor's time, etc. etc.
<BR>
True, when you grow your food you have to take certain steps to prepare it,
<BR>
but lots of fresh food can be palatable and digestible eaten raw, right off
<BR>
the vine or bush. And you can get someone else to process some of the food
<BR>
for you--my chickens, for example, turn termites and grubs into eggs and
<BR>
meat, and they mostly run around fending for themselves--costs me very
<BR>
little in time or effort to get my eggs &amp; chicken meat.
<BR>
<P>Housing need not be elaborate to be comfortable. Wastes need not be wasted
<BR>
and need not waste water. My toilet is a bucket underneath a board with a
<BR>
hole in it, into which I toss a scoop of high-carbon material (like coarse
<BR>
saw dust or partially decomposed dead leaves) after each use.  I've seen
<BR>
some pretty convincing research showing that the resulting thermophilic
<BR>
decomposition is THE safest and cleanest way to handle human shit and pee.
<BR>
And the cost to me for the toilet was around $2 for the bucket (the board I
<BR>
got free out of someone's trash pile).
<BR>
<P>People make basic living WAAAY more complicated than it needs to be. Let me
<BR>
emphasize that I'm NOT opposed to high tech.  But I am greatly opposed to
<BR>
inappropriate tech, whether it be high or low. Bill Mollison once said that
<BR>
he considers the concept of &quot;unemployment&quot; to be obscene.
<BR>
