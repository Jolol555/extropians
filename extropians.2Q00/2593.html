<P>Uploading.  There are a variety of hypothetical uploading strategies which
<BR>
are &quot;destructive,&quot; that is, the uploading destroys the flesh in the
<BR>
process.  Many people worry that if identity is not preserved, this is
<BR>
suicide, not a route to longevity.  You may find yourself in the position
<BR>
of deciding whether or not to undergo a procedure like this.
<BR>
<P>In addition, copies are likely to be made if the computer is anything like
<BR>
the computers of today, where data is cached, transferred, processed, then
<BR>
written to disk, etc.. Even if not, you'll be best served in terms of
<BR>
longevity if you keep lots of backups, assuming that making backups
<BR>
preserves &quot;you&quot; at all.
<BR>
<P>The long and the short of it is that medical &quot;immortality&quot; can take you
<BR>
only so far.  Maybe it'll get you thousands of years, but it's hard to
<BR>
imagine avoiding a sufficiently serious accident over the course of
<BR>
millions of years without recourse to at least some kind of minimal backup
<BR>
system, if not uploading.  So if you're bent on immortality, these are
<BR>
issues which you'll need to think about.
