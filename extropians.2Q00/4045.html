<EM>&gt; Well, Daniel, (I know your comments were addressed to Nadia and not to me;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; please excuse me for butting in)
</EM><BR>
<P>It's an open forum, so anyone can butt in or stay out.  No one's holding a
<BR>
gun to anyone's head here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; when you said there was nothing wrong with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stoking the fires of debate, it came across to me as though your main
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purpose in entering into the conversation was to manipulate the behavior
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the other parties to the conversation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I did NOT mean it that way.  Until I brought this _What Art Is_ up on
<BR>
this list, I've never seen so many reactions, especially negative reactions
<BR>
to my posts.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's like a put-down, like you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making fun of them for taking the issues seriously or something.  I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand why Nadia felt like moving on to some other conversation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Her choice.
<BR>
<P>I was not trying to put anyone down, even though she put me down and used ad
<BR>
hominem attacks on Rand.  It's not such a big deal. but if [all of] you
<BR>
reread the exchange, you'll see her accusing Rand of being ignorant and
<BR>
offering no proof of this ignorance.  Surely, Rand was not a painter, but to
<BR>
claim she had no knowledge or that she or anyone who wants to evaluate art
<BR>
has to jump through hoops and then not even find out if he or she has done
<BR>
the jumping is strange to me.  I don't think Rand was that ignorant.  Her
<BR>
comments seem to demonstrate this.  (Granted, she was not an expert in all
<BR>
the arts (who is?), but she seemed to have enough knowledge of the works
<BR>
(see the many examples she uses), technique, composition, and esthetics in
<BR>
general to not be bluffing at every turn.)
<BR>
<P>Also, Rand was not just taking an informed view and exploding it into a
<BR>
philosophical stance.  Instead, if one reads _The Romantic Manifesto_,
<BR>
despite its many flaws (see my web site for a few I've found in regards to
<BR>
architecture, Horror, and painting) she's not talking out of the side of her
<BR>
mouth.
<BR>
<P>The authors of _What Art Is_, Louis Torres and Michelle Marder Kahmi do have
<BR>
a background in the arts, both in teaching and criticism.
<BR>
<P>Later!
<BR>
