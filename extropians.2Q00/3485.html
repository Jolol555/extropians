</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; With big business we have the collective option of just saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no, or just saying less.  And we MUST exercise that option.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Michael S. Lorrey wrote: Lets say a community sets up a surveillance net,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even a competetive one, where every stoplight, every intersection, every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public area has cameras where private businesses can bid to maintain and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use them to enforce whatever laws the community wants to contract them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to enforce. How is the business to make money? Why, they make the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money by writing the most citations.
</EM><BR>
<P>But remember the enforcement businesses are bidding to create the
<BR>
largest amount of societal order and safety at the lowest cost, and
<BR>
you and I are the customer now.  The point of this whole exercise
<BR>
is to *reinforce* the notion that the *government is here to serve us*
<BR>
not the other way around.  We must constantly reinforce that concept,
<BR>
since it slips away otherwise, and we become a society of slaves.
<BR>
<P>If a private security company gets overzealous, then the citizenry
<BR>
decides to demand lower fines for minor infractions.  If murder is
<BR>
being perpetrated without the perps being caught, more security
<BR>
is demanded.  An equilibrium is established.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd rather see it become a non-profit decentralized volunteer effort, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sort of digital neighborhood watch.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ill buy it, Mike.  But Im a little surprised (and pleased) to see such
<BR>
a suggestion coming from you.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>Palo Alto essentially has such a system now.  And as you might
<BR>
expect, there isnt much crime there.  Regardless of how we vote,
<BR>
such systems will spontaneously arise, for surveillance equipment
<BR>
is cheap and small.  My 80 dollar wireless camera is already out
<BR>
of date, being 5 weeks old and all.  This week the 80 dollar model
<BR>
gives you and infrared sensors and motion detectors.
<BR>
<P>So what will happen when cameras are the size of marbles and
<BR>
cost 20 bucks?  Or the size of a BB and costs 5?  How soon
<BR>
do you suppose that will be?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Conditions of no risk should follow the no harm, no foul rule.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agree.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When they do all their calculations off the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tables, and every insurance company is re-insured by the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reinsurance syndicate, where do you get lower rates?
</EM><BR>
<P>Competitors would seek profit niches by using proprietary
<BR>
risk tables.  Example: those companies that specialize in
<BR>
motorcycle insurance.  Some years ago they established
<BR>
almost zero correllation between risk and engine size.  They
<BR>
ate the big guy's lunch.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; here's an example: Once, several years ago, for about 6 months, I drove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around with no license.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why you rebel child you.  {8^D  Not that *I* would ever do
<BR>
such a thing...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Capping what they can make will limit the enthusiasm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with which they will engage in law enforcement, but will result in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large roving population of law enforcers at any given time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What do you think?
</EM><BR>
<P>I dont know Mike, heres a lot of material in this post that I need
<BR>
to think over.  Now I gotta run, out to Palo Alto to the nano/extro
<BR>
schmooze.  spike
