<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Ross A. Finlayson&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:raf@tiki-lounge.com?Subject=Re:%20Legislation&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000607201607.82586.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">raf@tiki-lounge.com</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt;In this age of modern technology, we should use some of it to enable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cyber-grassroots mobilization.  What has come to mind is a web interface
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to a wwide variety of proposed legislation, a clearinghouse for it, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it were.  Say that as a U.S. citizen you can write suggested legislation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on any of a variety of topics that are legislatable.  Then, legislation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is organized so that different topics and causes will have compromises
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hammered, or separate proposals if they are incompatible.  Then, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;legislation is developed in this virtual town hall federally and for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each region, separately or as one, then as legislation passes through a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;public peer-review process and reaches the point where credible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;volunteers vouch for its Consitutionality and value depending on other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;merits, then the legislation is fast-tracked into the requisite forms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for each jurisdiction, ie, from electronic community, communication,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussion, review, and mobilization, then the real world requirements
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for placement in the processes of legislation are fulfilled, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;virtual communities' mobilization is used locally and extra-locally to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;satisfy any requirements, where some of the first legislation might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to enable electronic satisfaction of the requirements.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahh, sweet Utopia, once again you raise your pretty little head.
<BR>
<P>I think the tech underlying your suggestion is definitely doable.  After 
<BR>
all, its not all that much different from what sites like vote.com are 
<BR>
doing.  Problem is it would take a supreme amount of &quot;social engineering&quot; to 
<BR>
bring about.  Primarily because the lawyers and politicians are calling the 
<BR>
shots, and they are not likely to legislate themselves out of business 
<BR>
anytime soon.
<BR>
<P>But such democratizing alternatives to the creation of law should be 
<BR>
pursued.  One thing I'll be watching with great interest, for instance, is 
<BR>
to see how the &quot;Engines of Creation 2000&quot; Project comes out.

<BR>
<P>If they can get a book written by an entire community, I don't see it as 
<BR>
much of a stretch to get some legislation written the same way.  But if you 
<BR>
really want to see something as revolutionary as your proposal put to use in 
<BR>
real life anytime soon, you'd better take the advice of Dick The Butcher, 
<BR>
and kill all the lawyers first.
