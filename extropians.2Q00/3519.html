<P><EM>&gt; There's a wasp's nest out on the patio.  It was started a couple of months ago
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by an idiot wasp that figured it would make a nest right above the path of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traffic.  Since then it is still there, and it grows incrementally, it is about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an inch or two across.  Every day or so I see the wasp flyng from place to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place, and a few times it has buzzed me, or a plant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was loathe to destroy this wasp nest when it was first undertaken, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhat enjoy it being around, not having been stung.  Yet, if anyone is stung
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the wasp, then I will destroy it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The issue resolves to be how long the wasp is allowed.  It is relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; innocuous, and attractive in its way, but carries the capability to sting.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actuaries will tell us that the longer the wasp is around the more likely a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sting.  So then, the courses of action are to destroy the wasp's nest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immediately upon finding one, randomly, or when it is deemed intolerable by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some objective or subjective standard, or to let it remain indefinitely while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the probability of a wasp sting approaches one or is past..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In this case, then, I am the party with the requisite physical force to destroy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the wasp, of course the only reason to do so being that it has a sting.  As it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is, I do it no harm and let it multiply.
</EM><BR>
<P>In this case, the wasp nest is the government. I personally take great enjoyment in
<BR>
torching any wasp nest I find. Family allergies preclude my allowing my aesthetic
<BR>
appreciation of the construction to influence my decision...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At issue is how to balance that with the citizenry's assumption of innocence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is to say, every citizen is assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Thus,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some of these encroachments of automated monitoring are shadowy violations of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the explicit right to be free from undue searches.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, when an agent of government is at work monitoring the citizenry, then he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shall be monitored for the citizenry.  Anything less is a slope towards the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Orwellian nightmare dilemna.  It is recognized that the agents are citizens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As ever, it is not only who is watching, but who is paying the watchmen.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this case, it is the citizenry, indirectly, but the problem lies in that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; budgets are assigned by bureaucrats with insufficent accountability for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preservation of rights, yet at least there are systemic means of seeking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recourse of grievance.  In the sense of this thread of privatized law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcement and judicial undertakings, badges for hire are almost inherently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad for real justice.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree. Police are essentially, in computer lingo, trusted agents. They actually
<BR>
have little more power than the average person, but they typically get paid to
<BR>
enforce the law (note there are many communities with a large percentage of their
<BR>
police departments are volunteers). As I've said before, legally the only extra
<BR>
power they have that you and I don't have is the power to write traffic citations,
<BR>
because traffic violations are not, by definition, crimes, which was because police
<BR>
were assumed to be trusted on their word in a court of law. I think that given the
<BR>
lowering in cost of camera, recording, radar/lidar, and other technologies that the
<BR>
word of private individuals can be equally trusted when supported by corroborating
<BR>
evidence from these technologies. Given this, law enforcement should devolve either
<BR>
to a society of self-enforcement through self-monitoring and insurance based risk
<BR>
compensation, and/or a society of mutual private enforcement. What goes on when
<BR>
nobody is around or behind closed doors remains private and unenforceable, though
<BR>
the idea of self-monitoring driving should, I think, include some sort of
<BR>
breathalyzer technology that does not allow you to operate the vehicle when under
<BR>
the influence. Your insurance company might even let you pick what level of
<BR>
intoxication to have on your policy and let your premium reflect that risk.
