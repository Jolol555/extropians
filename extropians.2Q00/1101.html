<EM>&gt; However, I'd like to note in passing that _no_ country today is a utopia, or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has abolished poverty, or has abolished civil rights abuses. Some are better 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than others, but that's as far as it goes -- and even then, the relative 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; position varies depending on your status within your own culture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I totally agree with you.  As I said in my post, there is still much to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done, even in the United States.  But again, the U.S. does have much to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proud of in terms of making the world a better place, as does the United 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kingdom.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who has a &quot;right to be proud&quot;?  Politicians, half of whom promise to
<BR>
put a stop to everything the other half stand for?  The people on
<BR>
their payroll, who collect salaries for doing those politicians'
<BR>
executive and often dirty work?  The taxpayers, who fork over the
<BR>
money demanded from them?  I'm not proud of the U.S. bombing Kosovo,
<BR>
or using the atom bomb, or slaughtering the indigenous peoples and
<BR>
taking their land, but I guess my tax money helps pay for those things
<BR>
or things like them.  I'm not proud of mob rule, of two million people
<BR>
in jail (Two *Million* people in jail!), of trillions in debt, etc.,
<BR>
etc.
<BR>
<P>I wish people in the territory of the U.S. were ashamed, bitterly
<BR>
ashamed, of any active participation in the fraud called the
<BR>
government, and resolved to resist it in any way they could.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; And yet isn't extropianism an ideology also that has guiding principles to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'influence' or even 'pigeon-hole' members?  I realize that Max has written 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;these Principles are not presented as absolute truths or universal values.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I am just playing devil's advocate here.
</EM><BR>
<P>I actually find the idea of identifying and &quot;pigeonholing&quot; people as
<BR>
&quot;extropian&quot; or &quot;non-extropian&quot; kind of creepy and scary.  I'm on this
<BR>
list because I enjoy and hope to benefit from the ideas.  I want to
<BR>
stay informed about developments in nanotechnology, computational
<BR>
application of same and quantum mechanics, transhumanism, general
<BR>
technology advance, the philosophical implications of the above,
<BR>
privately produced law, etc.  These concerns emanate from my rational
<BR>
self-interest, not from any allegiance to extropianism as a movement
<BR>
that I can feel good about, learn the anthem for (&quot;... the artificial
<BR>
intelligences shall raise the human race!&quot;), and wear the nifty
<BR>
uniform of (now with epaulets!).  I feel extremely disinterested in
<BR>
the prospect of converting anyone in particular or in assessing
<BR>
anyone's extropian purity.  I'm only interested in the question of an
<BR>
extropian movment as an ancillary consideration to assisting building
<BR>
momentum for those advances which can raise everyone's standards of
<BR>
living and scope of choices and freedom: a practical problem (almost
<BR>
an engineering problem) of education or consciousness raising.  But I
<BR>
don't need or want a club of like-minded people or set of beliefs to
<BR>
cling to, and I hope and expect that this list won't become about &quot;us
<BR>
vs. them&quot; stuff.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; you continues:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd also like to note that from a non-American perspective making children 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swear an oath of allegiance in school each day looks positively Orwellian, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I don't see massive military power as being admirable, either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I sure don't consider children taking the oath of allegiance to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'brainwashing!'  ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but did you learn the songs?  How about the dances?  The marches?
<BR>
The salutes?  The proper way to wear the uniform, and polish (not to
<BR>
say, lick) the boots?  How about the high kicks?  Finally, no child's
<BR>
education would be complete without learning how to bend over in the
<BR>
presence of authority.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the words to be 'funny' and making eachother laugh.  But generally I took it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seriously and felt patriotic as I spoke the words.  I would want any future 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; child of mine to continue taking the pledge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I have never thought of the connection with the divine right of kings, very 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting.  The social contract between the citizen, other citizens and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their government is supposed to bind us together in mutual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-interest. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't sign it, anybody claiming to have seen me sign it is a damn
<BR>
liar, and you can't make me sign it!  :-) See Lysander Spooner on this
<BR>
topic.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Modern democracies are just a degenerate form of the monarchial system?  For 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasons stated above I would have to disagree.  I can see some connection 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but not the wholesale link you do.  I appreciate having the vast power one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; man used to have as king being spread around with various branches of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government that are limited by checks and balances.  And we can try to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; influence or change things without being hung or imprisoned if the king 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really dislikes the idea.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>Unless the king really, really dislikes the idea, at which point he
<BR>
might burn your house down with you, your friends and your children in
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I take pride in seeing my nation kick some else's work over when their work 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is going to be used for unjust aggression.  Kicking over Saddam Hussein's or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Omar Quadaffi's pile of blocks is no problem to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>That Omar -- such a naughty boy!  Omar Quadaffi?  Oh well, whoever he
<BR>
is, he probably has a good block kicking coming, right?  Or else why
<BR>
would the U.S. be kicking his blocks?  Must be his fault.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
