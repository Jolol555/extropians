</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Well...it takes a different mentality to lead an army of ignorant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;buillies, than to oversee a group of educated scientists.  Quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably, almost any person on this list - on the slightly inaccurate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;assumption that this list is representative of people who are at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;slightly informed about the most powerful new technologies of today -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would not stand to have suggestions for improvements ignored and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unappreciated day after day if a better option (defection to the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;side with lots of classified info) were available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Overally, I think your model explains part of why we do not see hordes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of well educated terrorists. But I still see enough engineers with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; good knowledge of engineering and an apalling lack of sociology to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; make me suspect there are other reasons too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The pursuit of knowledge and true power makes one less interested in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pursuit of power over people?
</EM><BR>
<P>This line of argument is probably one of those more likely to yield real 
<BR>
results.  The same problem is faced in bringing up baby SI's.  Either there 
<BR>
is or there isn't rational grounds for something that we would recognize as 
<BR>
morality, as in ethics - such as, the non-aggression principle.
<BR>
<P>The other part, without getting into any of the details, is that the 
<BR>
rationality of being ethical may in fact be contextual.  Eg., lieing in a 
<BR>
society in which aggression is rare and one is not being threatened for 
<BR>
telling the truth may be unethical and immoral, whereas lieing as a Jew in 
<BR>
NAZI Germany may be morally correct.  In fact, in societies such as that, a 
<BR>
rational ethics may be so impossible to derive on a moment by moment basis, 
<BR>
that the processing costs outweigh any possible benefits, and crude, first 
<BR>
approximations and main chances rule.
<BR>
<P>If these two general perspectives are accurate, then the questions become 
<BR>
related to what would be - in ideal circumstances - a rational ethics, and 
<BR>
what kind of society can support it.  I believe that these are two of the 
<BR>
main, if not most important questions, and, having partially resolved both, 
<BR>
I am working on systems to bring such a society about, i.e., social 
<BR>
infrastructure, such as an explicit universal social contract.
<BR>
<P>In a contractual society, in which - given my other assumptions - 
<BR>
presumeably all rational people could be convinced of the advantage of being 
<BR>
ethical, a lot of the really bad scenarios that would otherwise require 
<BR>
draconian measures, such as a police state to stop nanoterrorists, would be 
<BR>
limited to a probably small minority of very irrational people, who would 
<BR>
likely be identified fairly early as creating high risks for anyone who 
<BR>
dealt with them long term.  Thus, those people would be watched and would 
<BR>
probably pay high insurance premiums and find themselves unwelcome in many 
<BR>
social settings.
<BR>
<P>Contrast that to our present situation, in which our monopoly state creates 
<BR>
artificial divisions via its criminal law - eg., drug laws, &quot;cult&quot; 
<BR>
persecutions, etc. - and sets group against group, making ethical morality a 
<BR>
questionable virtue, and ensuring that there will always be no lack of 
<BR>
potential terrorist to deal with.  The drug war alone has virtually 
<BR>
demolished morality in the U.S., as it promotes all sorts of deceptions, 
<BR>
together with the pernicious idea that it's ok to jail people who themselves 
<BR>
have injured noone, because of the undesireable social consequences if 
<BR>
others were not deterred.  How the Lockeian &quot;founding fathers&quot; would have 
<BR>
had a field day with that one.
