<EM>&gt; I personally live in one of the most dangerous cities in Europe: Stockholm.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You think it is strange? Well, Stockholm has in all its recorded history
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been a violent city. For instance, today Los Angeles has a murder rate of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about 10.8 murders on every 100 000 inhabitants, Stockholm has 10.2!
</EM><BR>
<P>Very interesting.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Stockholm is the only metropolitan area in Sweden though, so the average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crime rate is comparatively low. The violence in Swedish society is also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very much concentrated on specific segments of society. Most often those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segments that don't receive much media coverage. &quot;Bum A and Bum B met at Bum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A's ratty apartement and started drinking, then Bum B killed Bum A in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drunken stupor&quot;, is the average Swedish murder, nothing sassy to write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about. But the violence is very much present in Stockholm, and its expanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outside the usual segments of society.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats how much crime is here as well, only the media spins the story based on
<BR>
the circumstances. If Bum A was a woman and Bum B was a man, its a case of
<BR>
'domestic violence' or 'stalking'. If Bum A is black and bum B is white, its a
<BR>
'racist hate crime killing', while if it were the other way around, it would be
<BR>
'gang violence'. If the ratty apartment were near a school campus and both bums
<BR>
were students, it would be a 'school shooting'. If Bum B was working for Bum A,
<BR>
it would be a 'crazed worker going postal' incident, and if the 'apartment' was
<BR>
the back of Bum A's van, then its 'murder on the highways'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Europe often points fingers at the US for its crime rate, while conveniently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forgetting its often higher (or at least comparable) crime rates. The US is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; often more heterogenous that the European countries (that have been heavily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; centralized) so comparisions between European countries and the US are often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not that good.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thank you Waldemar for the honest commentary.
