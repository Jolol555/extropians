I invested in Celera because Celera fit my profile for investing in a &quot;high
<BR>
risk&quot; stock and I think it's a good idea to have a least one high risk stock
<BR>
in investment portfolios.
<BR>
<P>Today's LA Times article &quot;Biotech Firm's Mix-Up on Fly Genome Creates A
<BR>
Stir&quot; caused me to laugh out loud.  So Celera mixed up some human
<BR>
ingredients (stretches of human genetic material)  with the fly ingredients
<BR>
(data posted to its Web site).  What the hey?   
<BR>
<P>The race to the moon has indeed been replaced by the race for the human
<BR>
genome (I've said this in my book) and just about as much pic 'n gad as the
<BR>
ole' mining towns in Colorado when, around the turn of the 19th Century, the
<BR>
levy-clad miners chugged down a pinch of whisky and hunted for a nugget.
<BR>
Like many Mother Lodes that were near-miss and took a miner for all his
<BR>
money, the race for the genetic-nuggets will, undoubtedly, produce a few
<BR>
misses, &quot;Thar's a fly in them thar genes.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Celera might need a night off to chill. The writer of this article might
<BR>
need a night off to chill along with the Wilson (another sequencing
<BR>
organization) who is calling &quot;glass houses.&quot;  I feel my investment is a good
<BR>
one, but I'd like to see less frenetic elbowing among companies.
