This is a rather longish excerpt from Nanotechnology: Research and
<BR>
Perspectives; Papers from the First Foresight Conference on Nanotechnology,
<BR>
published in 1992 by the MIT Press, Dr. Gregory Fahy wrote:
<BR>
<P>DNA polymerase alpha (DPA)      DNA polymerase alpha is required for most
<BR>
DNA repair and DNA synthesis. Like the processes of energy metabolism and
<BR>
immunity already discussed, DNA repair and synthesis are obviously
<BR>
fundamental life processes without which we would die quite quickly. It is
<BR>
therefore bizarre but true that we each have a gene for a defective version
<BR>
of DPA that switches on as we get older. The senescent or &quot;old-age&quot; form of
<BR>
the enzyme is called A1 DPA. It binds to DNA much more weakly than the
<BR>
youthful or A2 form of DPA and, consequently, it synthesizes and repairs DNA
<BR>
ten times more slowly than A2 DPA. In addition it makes an alarming number
<BR>
of mistakes. As we age, A1 DPA replaces more and more of our A2 DPA, until
<BR>
we have almost no A2 DPA at around the age of 65.
<BR>
<P>Equally amazing, it is possible to convert the senescent A1 DPA into a form
<BR>
that closely resembles A2 DPA by treating it with inositol-1,4-biphosphate,
<BR>
a sugar phosphate produced by the hormonal stimulation of cells. (9)  The
<BR>
natural transition from A2 DPA to A1 DPA is a programmed aging phenomenon
<BR>
that is measurably more advanced in 40-year-olds compared to 30-year-olds.
<BR>
We should be able to do something to prevent this process, presumably by
<BR>
altering the control regions for the A1 and A2 DPA genes or by adequately
<BR>
maintaining particular hormone levels such as growth hormone.
<BR>
<P>Although it has been suggested that shutting down cell division is a
<BR>
protective device for minimizing cancer, thereby making the A2 to A1
<BR>
transition good for us, misincorporation of DNA bases can only promote
<BR>
cancer. Furthermore, cancer may not be a problem regardless of DNA damage if
<BR>
we can maintain the immune systems of 18-year-olds, which probably eradicate
<BR>
cancer all the time without our awareness.
<BR>
<P>Elongation Factor One (EF-1)      George Webster has shown that there is a
<BR>
massive drop in protein synthesis in all tissues just before the age at
<BR>
which animal death rates accelerate. (10) By studying (directly or
<BR>
indirectly) all of the more than 50 molecular machines involved in the
<BR>
complex biosynthesis of proteins, he identified one molecule that was
<BR>
responsible for about half of this drop in protein synthesis in most
<BR>
organisms (rats, mice, and flies). (11)
<BR>
<P>Protein synthesis from available mRNA consists of three component processes:
<BR>
initiation, elongation, and termination. The portion of the protein
<BR>
synthesis process that decreases precipitously with age is elongation.
<BR>
Elongation in turn consists of three steps: (1) the amino acyl tRNA binds to
<BR>
the A site of the ribosome; a new peptide bond forms that links the new
<BR>
amino acid with the nascent peptide chain, thereby transferring the nascent
<BR>
peptide to the A site and releasing the cleaved tRNA (the transpeptidase
<BR>
reaction), and (3) the peptide with the added amino acid moves from the A
<BR>
site to the P site so that the next amino acyl tRNA can bind to the A site.
<BR>
With aging, the gene for elongation factor one (EF-1) is selectively shut
<BR>
off, effectively blocking the first step of the elongation process.
<BR>
<P>EF-1 is a major constituent of the cell; it comprises between 3 and 11
<BR>
percent of the total protein of a nonsenescent cell. We would like to be
<BR>
able to prevent the specific repression of this protein with age. The
<BR>
decreased protein synthesis caused by the repression of EF-1 may cause a
<BR>
drop in RNA synthesis since RNA polymerase is a protein. Indeed, global
<BR>
drops in RNA synthesis are usually seen with aging.
<BR>
<P>Webster has shown that administration of centrophenoxine can fully restore
<BR>
the massive drop in RNA synthesis that takes place with aging. In
<BR>
preliminary unpublished experiments, he has also found evidence that this
<BR>
drug can specifically reactivate transcription of EF-1 genes. Although
<BR>
Webster's results were obtained using a chromatin assay system in a test
<BR>
tube, centrophenoxine has also been shown to reactivate RNA and protein
<BR>
synthesis in vivo, in mammals, and to extend mammalian life span. However,
<BR>
its effectiveness is limited by its rapid hydrolysis in the body. The most
<BR>
elementary form of interventive molecular engineering imaginable would be to
<BR>
design a stable version of centrophenoxine that lacks a labile ester linkage
<BR>
yet still possesses the biological effects of centrophenoxine. This single
<BR>
trivial accomplishment could lead to major gains against aging.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P>With respect to our global understanding of aging, at least two very
<BR>
noteworthy developments have supported the notions I described. First, the
<BR>
appearance of Caleb Finch's truly epic book, Longevity, Senescence, and the
<BR>
Genome (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1990), a treasure trove of aging
<BR>
information, provides strong additional evidence for a predominantly genetic
<BR>
basis of aging. Second, a most unexpected synthesis has been presented by
<BR>
Sohal and Allen. (13) They posit that the progression of development, and
<BR>
hence also the progression of aging, is regulated by a redox-stat that
<BR>
gradually renders cytosol more oxidizing with time. Their synthesis, if
<BR>
correct, would show how past evidence for wear and tear is actually evidence
<BR>
for genetic control of aging.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P>My inference based on the DNA polymerase alpha story that it should be
<BR>
possible to prevent replicative senescence and compromised DNA repair
<BR>
appears to have been confirmed beyond all reasonable expectations by Mike
<BR>
West's findings. West claims to have totally conquered the cellular aging
<BR>
clock by using just two naturally occurring molecular triggers that can
<BR>
restore the youthful phenotype to any one of four entirely different types
<BR>
of senescent cell (endothelial cells, astrocytes, chondrocytes, and
<BR>
fibroblasts). (17) Finally, the possible significance of elongation factor
<BR>
one has been delightfully demonstrated by a paper of Shepard et al. In which
<BR>
flies made transgenic for EF-1 so as to avoid or postpone its down
<BR>
regulation with age were shown to have mean life spans equivalent to the
<BR>
maximum life spans of control flies. (18) However, this experiment is not
<BR>
yet definitive and awaits rigorous verification.

<P>The genetics of aging: New study says cell division errors may be the common
<BR>
link
<BR>
<P>La Jolla CA., March 31, 2000 -- Gradual genetic changes may be the source of
<BR>
many, if not all illnesses of aging, including breast cancer, osteoporosis,
<BR>
Alzheimer's disease and arthritis. A new study by scientists in The Skaggs
<BR>
Institute for Chemical Biology at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) in
<BR>
La
<BR>
Jolla and the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation,
<BR>
published in the latest issue of Science, concludes that human aging and its
<BR>
associated diseases and conditions can be traced to a gradual increase in
<BR>
cell division errors in tissues throughout the body. This functional change
<BR>
begins slowly in middle age and increases gradually with advancing age.
<BR>
<P>According to Richard A. Lerner, M.D., an author of the paper, &quot;Mitotic
<BR>
Misregulation and Human Aging,&quot; &quot;This represents a radical change in the way
<BR>
people have thought about aging. While scientists have believed that aging
<BR>
is
<BR>
a disease in which cells stop dividing, this study suggests that aging is
<BR>
really a disease of quality control. In this case the manufactured product
<BR>
is
<BR>
a new cell. As we get older, altered gene expression results in cells with
<BR>
diminished function.&quot; [etc]
