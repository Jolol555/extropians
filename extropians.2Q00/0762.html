<EM>&gt; You're right, Daniel, that people in general lost interest in visionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technological programs and, for years I thought that was the only reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that &quot;the space program&quot; ran aground in the 1970s.  But I've come to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different conclusion now.  The truth is that space didn't pay and with
</EM><BR>
20th century
<BR>
<EM>&gt; technology it never could.  I've yet to see a good economic justification
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the kind of truly massive public spending required to do anything
</EM><BR>
outside
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of LEO with that kind of technology and, believe me, I WANT to see such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>LEO is a start.  (Actually GEO appears to be where a lot of money is for
<BR>
commercial satelites.)  I think if the government space programs were shut
<BR>
down and private launch companies used exclusively, we'd see a lot of action
<BR>
in LEO leading to action higher up.  My guess would also be that this would
<BR>
build a true infrastructure for space colonization, rather than the rickety
<BR>
one NASA has built, abandoned, and rebuilt.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  Though I agree GNR will help make CAtS better, if we just took that old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Saturn V design, which, if I'm right, is now unpatented, we could be
</EM><BR>
making
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  disposable launch vehicles that could put huge cargoes in orbit NOW!
</EM><BR>
We'd
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  be using a proven technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm no rocket scientist (but I play one when I take people down to MSC for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tour), but I think simply reproducing the Saturn V would get you nowhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fast.  It was designed on the premise of non-reusability and LOTS of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money.  I think you agree that that design philosophy is NOT the way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go.
</EM><BR>
<P>I DISAGREE!  The problem is not reusable vs. non-reusable.  The fact that
<BR>
people think in those terms only shows how much this locks up the space
<BR>
mindset.  Reusable rockets, like the Shuttle, have actually increased launch
<BR>
costs, according to David P. Gump in his _Space Enterprise: Beyond NASA_.
<BR>
(I would also add that NASA's labor intensive approach to running the show
<BR>
also increases costs.  And remember, too, that those solid rocket boosters
<BR>
(SRBs) have to be recovered and refurbished at a huge price.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  The model we should be focusing on is open systems and looking for ways
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  get resources to pump into them cheaply.  This way, we don't need to do
</EM><BR>
all
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  kinds of fancy development, testing, and extensive monitoring after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  deployment.  I'd rather have spare air tanks than rely on an intricate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  ecosystem to keep me breathing.  (Surely, one could have both, but I
</EM><BR>
think
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  all of you get my point.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Daniel, if you're going to ask Earth to support an extraterrestrial
</EM><BR>
economy,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I think you have to come up with an economic rationale.  I'm waiting . . .
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not thinking that way, but I thought I answered this elsewhere.
