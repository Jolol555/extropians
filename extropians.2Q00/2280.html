<P>By ED SUSMAN, UPI Science News  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAN DIEGO, April 30, 2000 (UPI) -- Scientists said Sunday they  
<BR>
have used 
<BR>
gene therapy technology to reverse signs of aging in the brains of 
<BR>
monkeys 
<BR>
and predict that the research might translate into treatment for 
<BR>
Alzheimer's 
<BR>
disease. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We are now beginning clinical trials to determine whether  
<BR>
nerve growth 
<BR>
factor gene therapy will be useful in combating Alzheimer's disease in 
<BR>
humans,&quot; said Dr. Mark Tuszynski, professor of neurosciences at the 
<BR>
University of California, San Diego, at the annual meeting of the 
<BR>
American	
<BR>
Academy of Neurology in San Diego. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Normal aging in the primate brain is associated with a  
<BR>
decline in both 
<BR>
the function of neurons in the brain, and with their ability to create 
<BR>
connections to other targets in the brain,&quot; he said. &quot;Nerve growth factor 
<BR>
gene therapy ameliorates these age-associated declines in neuronal 
<BR>
function. 
<BR>
This finding is of particular interest for the potential treatment of the 
<BR>
most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease, 
<BR>
in 
<BR>
which neurons atrophy and die.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuszynski said that the neurons in the monkey brains were  
<BR>
reduced in size 
<BR>
by 10 percent. When the gene therapy was administered, the cells nearly 
<BR>
returned to normal, showing an average reduction in size of  3 percent. 
<BR>
He 
<BR>
said that change was statistically significant. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuszynski said that even if the clinical trials in humans work  
<BR>
well it is 
<BR>
unlikely the treatment would cure Alzheimer's disease, but he said that 
<BR>
it 
<BR>
might be able to delay the deterioration of patients for several years. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 4 million people in the United States have Alzheimer's  
<BR>
disease and 
<BR>
the number is growing, he said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gene therapy holds immense promise,&quot; said Dr. Francis  
<BR>
Kittredge of 
<BR>
Bangor, Maine, president of the AAN. &quot;But there are still a great many 
<BR>
challenges in treating the right patients with the right type of therapy. 
<BR>
We 
<BR>
certainly have a long way to go before we have a practical form of gene 
<BR>
therapy for human brain diseases.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuszynski said the human study that to begin this year will  
<BR>
test the gene 
<BR>
therapy procedure on eight patients with early, mild forms of Alzheimer's 
<BR>
disease. They will be evaluated for 18 months and then doctors will 
<BR>
decide 
<BR>
whether to perform a larger study. That won't happen before 2002, 
<BR>
Tuszynski 
<BR>
said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the experiments, doctors took a series of skin biopsies  
<BR>
from rhesus 
<BR>
monkeys. The skin cells were then incubated in test tubes, and were 
<BR>
infected 
<BR>
with a virus that had been genetically altered to remove harmful elements 
<BR>
and include a gene that induces the production of nerve growth factor. 
<BR>
The 
<BR>
virus infected the skin cells, and entered the cells nucleus, turning the 
<BR>
cells and their clones into mini-factories that produce the nerve growth 
<BR>
factor. After about three months, the cells had grown enough in volume to 
<BR>
be 
<BR>
implanted into the deep brain of the monkeys. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuszynski said that the cells are implanted through a fine  
<BR>
needle that is 
<BR>
guided into place using magnetic resonance and other imaging techniques. 
<BR>
He 
<BR>
said the cells have continued to produce nerve growth factor for at least 
<BR>
a 
<BR>
year. Tuszynski said that in chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's, the 
<BR>
ongoing production of growth factor is desirable. He said in other 
<BR>
conditions proliferation of the growth factor could cause side effects 
<BR>
such 
<BR>
as pain or tumor growth. In 250 experiments with monkeys, Tuszynski said, 
<BR>
there have been no signs of tumor growth, but it remains a theoretical 
<BR>
possibility. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study presented at the AAN meeting, Tuszynski reported  
<BR>
on analyses 
<BR>
of the brains of five monkeys. The primates were injected with cells that 
<BR>
were genetically altered. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure would be repeated in the human experiments.  
<BR>
Using patients' 
<BR>
own skin cells should reduce risk of rejection of the cells when 
<BR>
implanted 
<BR>
in the brain. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though gene therapy has suffered set backs, including the  
<BR>
death of 
<BR>
patients in some clinical trials, Tuszynski said his protocol was 
<BR>
approved 
<BR>
by the Food and Drug Administration without great debate. &quot;No one has 
<BR>
proposed a gene therapy protocol with as much preliminary primate data as 
<BR>
this one,&quot; he said at a news briefing. &quot;This study has a strong 
<BR>
foundation.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuszynski said the study should not be construed to be a  
<BR>
treatment to 
<BR>
prevent aging, &quot;but it is not a far stretch to suggest that this may be 
<BR>
useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.&quot;
