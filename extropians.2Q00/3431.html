<EM>&gt; I can't feel it, I can still get a high score on a IQ test but now I'm no more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conscious than a rock, John Clark is dead!&quot; I see no reason he would lie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about that so we could conclude that the religious people were right after all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and science can't duplicate a soul.

<P>Yes, I suppose this surprising result would change your mind.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, suppose a transporter-skeptic steps out and says, &quot;Oh,
<BR>
my God, I am the same person, I can feel it, I have a mystic awareness
<BR>
of connection to my previous self that is much deeper and more complete
<BR>
than anything I have ever known.  It is as though God himself intervened
<BR>
and transfered my soul from the old me to the new me.&quot;  This surprising
<BR>
result might change his mind as well.
<BR>
<P>I think in either case it is a sign of a transmitter malfunction,
<BR>
or a proof of some mystical component to the soul.  If we stick to a
<BR>
materialistic view of the world, a properly functioning transmitter will
<BR>
not surprise anyone, and doing the experiment will not shed any light on
<BR>
the facts of the matter.  In fact I don't think there is any experiment
<BR>
which will provide facts about this question (in such a world), which
<BR>
suggests to me that there are no facts.
