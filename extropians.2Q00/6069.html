<EM>&gt; I'm violating my stated intent to remain silent for a few days,

<P>Brian, you seem to be acting really selectively here. From your
<BR>
unsupported assertions to much lackadaisical commentary and off the cuff
<BR>
commentary that has no basis in fact, you've gone and managed to annoy a
<BR>
large number of the active list participants, all the while insisting
<BR>
that you are mr. rosy and innocent.
<BR>
<P>Your off list friends may agree with you, but based on what you posted
<BR>
that you showed them, you apparently only presented them with posts that
<BR>
put you in a good light. Natasha had not participated in any of your
<BR>
prior discussions, but you for some odd reason felt the need to go off
<BR>
and insult and impunge her as well. When Max rose to tell you to step
<BR>
off, you continued to rake the coals by belittling he and Natasha. Your
<BR>
behavior is frankly beyond the bounds of acceptable conduct on a list
<BR>
like ours. If you wish to retain any place here, I would emphatically
<BR>
suggest you make a sincere and full apology to both Max and Natasha and
<BR>
let the discussion drop at that. 
<BR>
<P>I imagine, from the way you have conducted yourself here, that you are
<BR>
the sort of person who gives thanks every day for the fact that duels
<BR>
are no longer legal means of settling personal disputes of honor. If you
<BR>
conduct yourself in your real interpersonal relations as you have here,
<BR>
I would imagine that you would not last long in such an environment. The
<BR>
idea that you think you can so offhandedly make personal aspersions
<BR>
about a mans wife and expect no adverse repercussions just boggles the
<BR>
mind.
