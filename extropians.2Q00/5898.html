<EM>&gt;The big problem with the Outer Space Treaty and the Moon Treaty is that
</EM><BR>
they
<BR>
<EM>&gt;violate a principle of international law called 'dereliction of
</EM><BR>
sovereignty',
<BR>
<EM>&gt;whereas a claimant to sovereign power over some piece of property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;must maintain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some sort of presence or record of regular visitation and maintenance.
</EM><BR>
<P>[snip] and
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This clearly opens up the possibility that these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;treaties have no force under international law due to their violation of
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;principle of dereliction of sovereignty.
</EM><BR>
<P>Except, of course, that the treaties _are_ international law, and
<BR>
trump any previous customary principle of &quot;dereliction of
<BR>
sovereignty.&quot;  The ancient customary principle of &quot;dereliction of
<BR>
sovereignty&quot; has no more application in the context of outer space
<BR>
than the ancient concepts of dowry and couverture do in the context
<BR>
of modern U.S. marriage law.
<BR>
<P>This is because the treaties are widely acquiesed to by the
<BR>
subjects/actors of international law, the society of sovereign
<BR>
states.  Just like a Parliament can change the previous customary
<BR>
rules of common law, so can the community of states change the
<BR>
previous customary rules of international law.  A treaty is like
<BR>
legislation -- it trumps the customary law, if that is the intent of
<BR>
the parties.
<BR>
<P>(I'm assuming here that the treaties in question _have_ been ratified
<BR>
by a significant number of nations (and particularly the &quot;important&quot;
<BR>
ones) so that the international community views them as having the
<BR>
&quot;force of law&quot; (in the particular sense of that term in the
<BR>
international legal sphere).  I don't know the ratification numbers
<BR>
for these treaties, but you all appear to be talking about them as if
<BR>
all the major powers and a substantial number of the rest of world's
<BR>
nations have signed them.  I will omit from this discussion the
<BR>
debate about whether each nation must sign a treaty before it is
<BR>
governed by its rules: the prevailing modern trend is that a
<BR>
sufficent level of supermajority support results in the law governing
<BR>
all sovereigns (particularly all U.N. members), but this issue is not
<BR>
completely settled.)
<BR>
<P>Like all law, international law is simply a set of customs and norms
<BR>
that a society has somehow agreed govern the actions of its players.
<BR>
How that agreement might have been reached in the past (e.g., use of
<BR>
force, fait accompli by powerful actors, an appeal to &quot;God's natural
<BR>
laws&quot;, an appeal to utilitarian reasoning, the rhetoric of justice,
<BR>
etc.) does not really impact the fact that &quot;law&quot; (writ large) is
<BR>
based on social consensus, and that a society can change the old
<BR>
rules should it decide (for any of the above reasons, or others) that
<BR>
newly proposed rules are better.  Old hoary principles of
<BR>
international law dating from the Renaissance (or maybe the Romans)
<BR>
can be changed.
<BR>
<P>Laws evolve, based on changing social consensus.  (I use evolve in
<BR>
the technical Darwinian sense:  the law best suited to the particular
<BR>
environment is the most likely to succeed.  Environments can be
<BR>
radically different, based on time, technology, economic conditions,
<BR>
culture of the society, etc.)
