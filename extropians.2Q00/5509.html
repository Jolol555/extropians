<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Here's something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interesting I noticed when I was learning how to fly airplanes. When I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;working on getting my landings smooth,
</EM><BR>
<P>Bonnie,
<BR>
<P>The more I read what you write, the more I feel like I'm in a presence
<BR>
of a superwoman. Are you a real person, Bonnie? And not some sophisticated
<BR>
Eliza program that maybe my ancient Macintosh inserted into my
<BR>
daily Extropy digests?
<BR>
<P>I have a book recommendation that you might like. Not because I think
<BR>
that you might learn something from it, but because you remind me of
<BR>
the main character in the story. (It's a true story). It's a thin
<BR>
but rich book that one can read on a long Sunday afternoon (I read
<BR>
it about a year ago.)
<BR>
<P>_Paddling my Own Canoe_ by Audrey Sutherland, Univ of Hi Press, 1978.
<BR>
<P>The book is about a woman (Sutherland) who first started making solo
<BR>
journeys to a particular inaccessible beach in Moloka'i in 1958. She
<BR>
was a strong woman who made her first attempts swimming from one side of
<BR>
the island (after being dropped there by plane), dragging her gear
<BR>
in waterproof containers that she also built, and then later she
<BR>
improvised by building small rafts/canoes. This part of Moloka'i
<BR>
was uninhabited and, because of terrain and enormous cliffs around,
<BR>
one could not reach the beach from inland. And the Moloka'i Channel
<BR>
is one of the most dangerous stretches of water in the Pacific
<BR>
Ocean, so that getting there by boat is/was non-trivial too.
<BR>
<P>Each year she learned new things on how to accomplish this task,
<BR>
and became more knowledgeable and sophisticated in her sea-faring
<BR>
methods. Eventually she built a cabin for herself on that beach,
<BR>
bringing all of the materials patiently on each journey.
<BR>
<P>I think that this book might be a good book for teenagers to read
<BR>
when they have times when they think that they cannot do anything.
<BR>
It might be particularly helpful to young girls. I liked the
<BR>
book because I think that she is an amazing woman, and it's
<BR>
inspirational for me, and the book descriptions remind me of my childhood
<BR>
(I grew up in Hawai'i in the 60s, and my family and I lived on boat for
<BR>
a year). Plus I especially liked her descriptions of solitude. It brings
<BR>
&quot;home&quot; to me why I like to go on long solo bike trips.
<BR>
<P>I'll quote from the last part of the book- my favorite part.
<BR>
<P>{begin quote}
<BR>
<P>&quot;And why did I always come alone to Moloka'i? I know why, but
<BR>
the telling is hard. Daily we are on trial, to do a job, to make
<BR>
a marriage good, to find depth, serenity, and meaning in a complex,
<BR>
deterioating world of politics, false values, and trivia. But rarely
<BR>
are we deeply challenged physically or alone. We rely on friends,
<BR>
on family, on a committee, on community agencies outside ourselves.
<BR>
To have actual survival, living or dying, depends on our own ingenuity,
<BR>
skill, or stamina- this is a core question we seldom face. We
<BR>
rarely find out if we like having only our own mind as company for
<BR>
days or weeks at a time. How many people have ever been total isolated,
<BR>
ten miles from the nearest other human, for even two days?
<BR>
<P>Alone, you are more aware of surroundings, wary as an animal to danger,
<BR>
limp and relaxed when the sun, the brown earth, or the deep grass say,
<BR>
&quot;Rest now.&quot; Alone you stand at night, alert, poised, hearing through
<BR>
ears and open mouth and fingertips. Alone, you do not worry whether
<BR>
someone else is tired or hungry or needing. You push yourself
<BR>
hard or quit for the day, reveling in the luxury of solitude. And
<BR>
being unconcerned with human needs, you become as a fish, a boulder, a
<BR>
tree- a part of the world around you.
<BR>
<P>I stood once in midstream, balanced on a rock. A scarlet leaf fluttered,
<BR>
spiraled down. I watched it, became a wind-blown leaf, swayed, fell into
<BR>
the water with a giant human splash, then soddenly crawled out, laughing
<BR>
uproariously.
<BR>
<P>The process of daily living is often intense and whimsical. The joy of it,
<BR>
and the compassion, we can share, but in pain we are ultimately alone.
<BR>
The only real antidote is inside. The only real security is not insurance
<BR>
or money or a job, not a house and furniture paid for, or a retirement fund,
<BR>
and never is it another person. It is the skill and humor and courage
<BR>
within, the ability to build your own fires and find your own peace.
<BR>
<P>On a solo trip you may discover these, or try to build them, and life
<BR>
becomes simple and deeply satisfying. The confidence and strength remain
<BR>
and are brought back and applied to the rest of your life.&quot;
<BR>
