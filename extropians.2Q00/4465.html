<EM>&gt; &gt;Surely the discovery of a new pleasure is no less delightful when it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;comes due to a change in perspective than when it happens for any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;other reason. Studies in evolutionary psychology and so forth are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;interesting, but I can't see that such theories justify the statement,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;This sounds an awful lot like you are just changing as you get older.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know. I don't agree with Robin's statement either. *Many* factors in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one's life could bring about large changes in perspective, which can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lead to discoveries of new pleasures.

<P>Yes, there are purely sensory changes, for example, as a little kid I hated
<BR>
mushrooms, beans, and broccoli intensely. I did not mind vegetablies in the
<BR>
general sense, just the taste of those. Today, I rather enjoy mushrooms and
<BR>
broccoli, though string beans are still unacceptable for me. Same thing with
<BR>
beer, my tastes in beer have drifted from the light ales and lagers down to the
<BR>
browns, porters, stouts and bitters. Guinness is like the nectar of the gods to
<BR>
me. My taste in wine has developed similarly.
<BR>
<P>I think with age you learn, sometimes through negative experiences, sometimes
<BR>
through positive ones, that patience, observation, deliberation, and long term
<BR>
commitment are as important as dexterity and decisiveness. It took me until I
<BR>
had my own first business the importance of doing your homework, as I basically
<BR>
got through school on tests alone. I thought that everything had to be done NOW,
<BR>
that you need to use other people's money to capitalize big launches, etc. This
<BR>
may be possible for some, but not for me. I don't have the stomach for the kind
<BR>
of con job carnie act you have to pull to bring that sort of thing off. My
<BR>
integrity means more to me than that, and I don't like high stress environments.
