<EM>&gt; So, this interested me enough that I decided to do a little web
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research.  Not much; I'm no expert.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; First off, I was struck by the claim that she didn't actually do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything for those likely to survive her treatment.  While I was aware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the fact that she administered to the dying, I was also given to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand that she would feed the hungry, cure the sick, etc.

<P>If I remember correctly, her order's assets at the time of her death
<BR>
were on the order of US $250M. She was used to being ferried around in
<BR>
the executive jets of her friends -- who included some rather dubious
<BR>
dictators. 
<BR>
<P>One might argue that if one runs a multinational organisation dedicated
<BR>
to looking after the sick and dying, one ought to be spending a _little_
<BR>
of that money on medical care. And there's a certain contradiction between
<BR>
that vow of obedience, chastity and poverty and a quarter of a billion
<BR>
bucks ...
<BR>
<P>I'll need to go digging to come up with the exposes I read, and I'd need
<BR>
to do a bit more digging to verify them, but the picture I have of Teresa
<BR>
of Calcutta is of a scheming bitch whose life-goal was not merely to
<BR>
get herself beatified, but to found a holy order that would keep her
<BR>
name alive for a thousand years.
