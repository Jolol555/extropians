<EM>&gt; True, but where are you launching from? Canada? Mexico? Frankly I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worried about sophisticated threats from terrorists. They don't have

<BR>
<P>What the heck -- I've been pondering this for a while, so I'll throw
<BR>
the question out:
<BR>
<P>What do you think of the possibility of delivery of nukes in a
<BR>
container ship?  This is my main scenario to fear: some North Korean
<BR>
(or other potentially hostile nation) agents bribe dockworkers
<BR>
somewhere close to home (South Korea in this case, though I guess this
<BR>
just got a heck of lot less likely in the last few days) to allow them
<BR>
to insert just one &quot;special&quot; carton among the thousands and thousands
<BR>
of cartons in a container aboard a cargo ship, set to detonate via GPS
<BR>
trigger upon arrival at the correct latitude and longitude.  The
<BR>
dockworkers might just assume it's a contraband shipment, not a weapon
<BR>
of mass destruction.
<BR>
<P>In the mideast, this scenario could play out as a nuke stashed in an
<BR>
oil tanker, possibly.
<BR>
<P>I have heard (though never got confirmation, anybody know for sure?
<BR>
Care to tell me I'm wrong and quit worrying?)  that the vast majority
<BR>
of cargo arriving in U.S. ports never goes through any kind of
<BR>
inspection, and if it does it's usually a random inspection of a small
<BR>
portion of the contents, making it extremely unlikely that one
<BR>
particular suspicious carton among the Hyundai's or whatever would be
<BR>
noticed.
<BR>
<P>Of course, this gets even easier if it's a bioweapon.  Essentially,
<BR>
I'm much more worried about trojan horses more than sophisticated
<BR>
ICBM's or other weapons systems.
<BR>
