<EM>&gt; &gt;I agree that the current situation is not like 1929- today's bubblicious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;stock mania, massive credit creation excesses,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; See for example:
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; &quot;The fact that a dangerous real estate bubble runs simultaneously makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this both an extraordinary period and one unfortunately quite vulnerable to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; financial accident.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Which I don't buy. The current real estate bubble is half that of the
<BR>
late 80's. It has a long way to go to get anywhere near as speculative
<BR>
as it was then.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Doug Noland has done some interesting analysis on money/cedit/debt creation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by GSE's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My central thesis is that an unwinding in any of these highly leveraged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; positions (e.g. stocks, real estate, hedge funds, and above all banking-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particularly gold banking) will cascade into the others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Example 1.: A person uses a 125% ditech re-fi to invest in stocks, pulling out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; profits to pay the mortgage. Stocks go down, mortgage payments missed, bank
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is short on reserves, has to unwind some of its leveraged positions, such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as OTC currency hedges and stocks. Multiply by 10 million Joe Sixpacks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Joe sixpacks who still think that their house is their primary
<BR>
investement and who are working 50-60 hours a week, making plenty of
<BR>
money on overtime to pay their mortgages.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Example 2.: The systemic risk to the global financial system *may* now be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great enough that a single actor can cause widespread collapse, similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to Nobel Prize-winning LTCM- the &quot;house of cards&quot; argument. Say Soros cuts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a deal with the Chinese to supply several hundred tons of gold at price
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (spot + X). China sell its US T-bonds to finance. Connect dots.
</EM><BR>
<P>China just liquidated lots of gold last fall, as did many other
<BR>
countries, which is why the price went down rather than up leading up to
<BR>
y2k.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here in Seattle we are seeing signs of financial stress- people I know or know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of that have lost *large* amounts in the stock market and a whole lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stiff upper lips- call it a mood index.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Prediction: Seattle will lead the nation on the downside.
</EM><BR>
<P>As it did the last time, but losses by high tech investors is nowhere
<BR>
near equivalent to hundreds of lost or canceled airplane orders by
<BR>
airlines during the gulf war.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consumer and corporate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;debt loads, current account deficit, real estate inflation, surreal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;government statistics, fraudulent accounting practices in technology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;firms like Lucent, Intel, IBM, Microsoft, etc., gold banking implosion-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in-the-making,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; See for example:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.tocqueville.com/brainstorms/brainstorm0031.shtml">http://www.tocqueville.com/brainstorms/brainstorm0031.shtml</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the nastiest one. It can lead to a fundamental shift in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monetary order. To the *rest* of the world, gold is money.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nut eeny mere. The selloff of gold overseas last fall demonstrated that
<BR>
most foreign countries no longer regard gold as money.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;bank derivatives exposures (ala LTCM writ large), and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;so forth ad nauseum make the crash/depression of 1929-1939 look like a speed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;bump.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I couldn't disagree more. The strictness of accounting standards is much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;tougher now than then.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some significant amount (I don't have figures in front of me for this) of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporate earnings in the past few years has come from playing in the stock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with other companies stocks. This works great on the upside (everyone is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genius in a bull market)- but yields nasty fire-sale de-leveraging on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; downside.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Prediction: Many prominent companies will have horrific 2nd quarter earnings.
</EM><BR>
<P>Corporate profits have been up. Even the 'miserable' earnings report
<BR>
issued for MS was 'only' 2 cents higher than expected, for 'only' a 28%
<BR>
increase in revinues.
<BR>
<P>Sorry, fear mongering isn't going to cause a bunch of extropians to
<BR>
selloff.
