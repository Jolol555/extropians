What good will [lying or] contesting do?
<BR>
There are many ways to defeat a charge beyond the &quot;did or didn't do the 
<BR>
deed&quot; evidence, like due process mistakes, miss-enforecement, void for 
<BR>
vuageness, procedural error &quot;testilying&quot;, lack of elements, 
<BR>
miss-codification (bad statute), conflicts of law, and many more types of 
<BR>
collateral attacks/defences or demmurers than I can list here.
<BR>
<P>The courts are already totaly overburdened with existing cases !
<BR>
If everyone who was cited with a traffic infraction were to demand a jury 
<BR>
trial. and did due dilligence with discovery etc, the courts would collapse 
<BR>
under the strain with the CURRENT caseload.

they do

<EM> &gt; now.

<EM> &gt; I think they'd be nearly obsolete.

<EM> &gt; If every act was archived, every action known by all, prosecutors,

lawyers
<BR>
<EM> &gt; and judges would have to go the way of the dodo.For this reason alone, it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; couldn't happen, since lawyers need jobs as much as criminals do.

<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The way it is today, these kinds of arguments find wieght. When 
</EM><BR>
everything is
<BR>
<EM> &gt; known what good will lying or contesting do?

<P>With such technology comes the technology to counterfeit surveillance

data.
