phil osborn wrote a bummer tale of police incompetence:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When I called the Santa Ana police, I get this idiot who uses every argument
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he can think of to refuse taking a report.  In the past, I have always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gotten good cooperation on these incidents.  I made the mistake of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioning to this guy that similar incidents had happened repeatedly in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; past.  So he starts asking me, in this unbelievably snide, sarcastic tone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;and did your making a report ever, in all these incidents, result in any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrest or get you any compensation.  No.  So what is the point of making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this report now?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I point out that this establishes a pattern, in case the perps are ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; caught, and that, furthermore, I would like to have it on record if I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to substantiate a medical claim later.  Then he comes off the wall.  &quot;Well,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your injury has NOTHING to do with the alleged crime.  We don't get involved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with that.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Why not think outside the box for a moment.  You've typed all the
<BR>
details out---what is to stop you from filing the report yourself? 
<BR>
So what if you bumped into a worthless cop---email your report in
<BR>
and then mail a hard copy.  You can be miles ahead of this game by
<BR>
doing the work yourself.  If the lazy cop was out of line, he'll
<BR>
catch it and you'll be a bit more confidant the next time you try to
<BR>
file a telephone report.  BTW, your story sounds remarkably like
<BR>
what so many frustrated minorities say about dealing with
<BR>
governmental types and corrupt police: they aren't taken seriously. 
<BR>
Do something.
