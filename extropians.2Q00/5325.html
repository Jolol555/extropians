<P>Haaaa!  Great comment Robert.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>Some cluey person help me out here.  I understand we cryos have
<BR>
two choices basically: full body or just head.  I have been bugging my
<BR>
parents and my wifes parents about cryonics {they are all healthy
<BR>
mentally and physically}.  So far I have one definitely in, one
<BR>
definitely out, and two undecideds and two unapproached {the
<BR>
step parents}.  I would be paying in each case, out of my own resources.
<BR>
<P>One of the undecideds objects to being decapitated (even after
<BR>
he's dead!), but will agree if I arrange to do a full body.  I countered
<BR>
that this costs a lot more, and that by doing so he would perhaps
<BR>
be displacing three other family members who would otherwise
<BR>
get neuros.  So he went off to ponder this.
<BR>
<P>In the meantime, I came up with another idea.  Is there a third
<BR>
choice whereby the brain is removed and frozen by itself?  Strange
<BR>
as it may sound, my father-in-law would be willing to have any
<BR>
organ removed for donation following his demise, including his
<BR>
brain, to be donated to some downloaded Commander-Data-ish
<BR>
future version of himself.
<BR>
<P>I can even imagine a brain-only deal might actually *increase* the
<BR>
likelihood of eventual revival for it might allow quicker cooling
<BR>
of the brain mass, thereby reducing warm-brain injury.  Is that
<BR>
called ischemia?  One could even have a traditional open
<BR>
casket funeral, thus.  A surgeon could be called as soon as
<BR>
one breathed their last.  In the mean time, a machine could
<BR>
keep the heart beating and lungs breathing.  Upon arrival,
<BR>
the surgeon would make an incision from the back of the
<BR>
neck vertically over the top of the head, split the skin, peel
<BR>
it away from the skull, saw off the scull from about the eyebrows
<BR>
around where the ears were, remove the skullcap, drop the
<BR>
brain out, sever the spinal cord as far down as possible,
<BR>
drop the patient into an ice bath, reattach the skull cap,
<BR>
put the skin back in place, superglue the incision, plop the
<BR>
earthly remains into a wooden box to use as a decoration
<BR>
for the traditional cultural rites of passage, while the patient
<BR>
cools to 0 within minutes of surgery, to then continue her
<BR>
journey deep into the negative numbers, with the hope that
<BR>
some day Drexlerinos will map the location and configuration
<BR>
of each neuron and synapse, create a digital analog of some
<BR>
sort so that the patient will awake on that glorious day to
<BR>
compute again.
<BR>
<P>Is there a company doing brain-only cryopreservation?  This
<BR>
may well be my father-in-law's only hope.  spike
