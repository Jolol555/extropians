Brains On Ice 
<BR>
Chilling Down A Stroke Victim's Brain May Boost Chances 
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www/CBSNEWS.COM/SCI-TECH">http://www/CBSNEWS.COM/SCI-TECH</A>
<BR>

<BR>
AP      
<BR>
(AP) The coolest idea in stroke treatment is refrigeration. Yes, cold is hot.
<BR>
<P>Many doctors believe they can reduce permanent damage after a stroke by
<BR>
quickly
<BR>
dropping victims' body temperatures for a day or two, in effect, storing
<BR>
theirbrains on ice until the crisis passes. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's like putting food in the refrigerator. It doesn't go bad. You slow down
<BR>
all the processes,&quot; says Dr. David Tong of Stanford University. 
<BR>
<P>The approach is new, but the insight behind it -- that cold protects the
<BR>
brainjust as a fridge keeps grapefruit -- has been recognized for centuries. 
<BR>
<P>Everyone knows a story of a child who falls into any icy pond, is fished out
<BR>
after 45 minutes and then is warmed up and found to be as good as ever. The
<BR>
chilly water suspends biological processes that ordinarily would kill brain
<BR>
cells almost immediately. 
<BR>
<P>Though done occasionally during surgery, chilling the sick was regarded as
<BR>
tooclumsy, risky and unpleasant to be routine, and flat-out impractical for
<BR>
the
<BR>
700,000 or so strokes in the United States each year. Instead, researchers
<BR>
betthat medicines would be designed to work as well. But that goal has proven
<BR>
disappointingly elusive as dozens of supposedly brain-protecting drugs failed
<BR>
testing over the past decade. 
<BR>
<P>Now, backed by fresh science and new technology, doctors are taking a serious
<BR>
second look at cold. They hope soon to prove it a workable and valuable first
<BR>
step for treating victims of strokes. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;When done carefully, there are strong early indications of effectiveness,&quot;
<BR>
says
<BR>
Dr. Jeffrey Saver of the University of California, Los Angeles. 
<BR>
<P>Strokes typically occur when a blood clot lodges in the tree of arteries in
<BR>
the
<BR>
head, choking off the flow. Quickly giving the clot dissolver TPA can
<BR>
forestall
<BR>
much of the damage, but most patients do not get to the hospital soon enough
<BR>
for
<BR>
the medicine to do any good. 
<BR>
<P>Even after TPA can no longer help, brain cells continue to die off for
<BR>
severalmore hours. The cells killed first are filled with proteins that ooze
<BR>
out as
<BR>
they die. These substances trigger a chemical chain reaction that kills
<BR>
neighboring cells. 
<BR>
<P>In theory, doctors say, cooling the head should slow or even stop the
<BR>
destruction of these vulnerable bystanders. Several small experiments,
<BR>
intended
<BR>
largely to examine whether cooling stroke victims is even feasible, offer
<BR>
tantalizing hints of this. 
<BR>
<P>At the Cleveland Clinic, doctors have cooled five victims of especially
<BR>
severestrokes, dropping their temperatures a few degrees for a day or two.
<BR>
Ordinarily,
<BR>
80 percent of such people die or are seriously disabled. Against the odds,
<BR>
twoof these five recovered completely. 
<BR>
<P>Doctors at the University of Texas in Houston saw similar results cooling
<BR>
victims of cardiac arrest. Like a stroke, cardiac arrest wrecks the brain by
<BR>
shutting off its blood supply. Victims often suffer permanent brain damage,
<BR>
even
<BR>
if paramedics eventually restart their hearts. 
<BR>
<P>The Houston doctors chilled seven patients who arrived at the hospital in
<BR>
comas
<BR>
after being resuscitated. After a day of cooling, two of them soon returned
<BR>
completely to normal, while another is nearly so. 
<BR>
<P>Dr. James Grotta cautions that such examples prove little. Without carefully
<BR>
controlled studies, doctors can only guess how many would get better on their
<BR>
own. 
<BR>
<P>Still, he says, &quot;we have been very encouraged. I have seen results that in my
<BR>
mind are very dramatic.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Much as doctors would like to, there is no way of cooling just the head. They
<BR>
must chill the entire body. In all the experiments so far, this is done the
<BR>
old-fashioned way. Patients are covered in air-cooled blankets and sometimes
<BR>
packed in ice or rubbed with alcohol. 
<BR>
<P>However, later this year, doctors will try something entirely new. Human
<BR>
studies
<BR>
are expected to begin with devices that cool the body from the inside out. 
<BR>
<P>At least three small U.S. companies are working on these cold-tipped
<BR>
catheters.
<BR>
They are threaded from the groin up to the inferior vena cava, the big vein
<BR>
that
<BR>
runs down the center of the abdomen. There the catheter cools the blood
<BR>
flowing
<BR>
over it. Developers estimate they can lower an adult's temperature several
<BR>
degrees with pinpoint accuracy in an hour or less. 
<BR>
<P>Dr. E. Sander Connolly of Columbia University uses baboons to test a cold
<BR>
catheter made by Innercool Therapies of San Diego. The scientists triggered
<BR>
the
<BR>
experimental equivalent of a stroke by temporarily clamping an artery in the
<BR>
animals' heads. To mimic the usual real-world delay getting to the hospital,
<BR>
they waited a few hours, then cooled the animals' blood for a day or more. 
<BR>
<P>The results from the seven animals studied look good, Connolly says. &quot;The
<BR>
strokes are smaller. Their neurological exams are better.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Innercool and two competitors - Radiant Medical of Redwood City, Calif. and
<BR>
Alsius Corp. of Irvine, Calif. - plan studies on victims of strokes and
<BR>
cardiac
<BR>
arrest, as well as on patients whose brain circulation must be stopped
<BR>
temporarily so doctors can fix broken blood vessels inside their heads. 
<BR>
<P>Deep-cooling the traditional way is already sometimes used to help minimize
<BR>
damage during this kind of surgery. It was also routine in the early days of
<BR>
open-heart surgery, before the invention of circulation machines that pump
<BR>
theblood while the heart is stopped. For these operations, doctors typically
<BR>
plunged patients to such low temperatures that dangerous complications can
<BR>
occur, such as irregular heartbeats and blood clotting. 
<BR>
<P>In these cases, the patients are unconscious, as were the few stroke and
<BR>
cardiac
<BR>
arrest victims treated with cooling in Cleveland, Houston and elsewhere. When
<BR>
patients are unconscious, doctors can easily control one of the most
<BR>
problematic
<BR>
ill effects of cold - violent shivering. 
<BR>
<P>But many stroke patients remain conscious. Stopping deeply cooled, conscious
<BR>
patients from shivering would probably require knocking them out, paralyzing
<BR>
them and hooking them to breathing machines. 
<BR>
<P>None of this appeals much to doctors. The treatment could be done only in
<BR>
intensive care, making it horrendously expensive. The risk of complications
<BR>
could be substantial. And physicians routinely check on stroke patients'
<BR>
progress by talking to them, something they certainly cannot do if their
<BR>
patients are out cold. 
<BR>
<P>However, a chance discovery a decade ago suggests a way around much of this:
<BR>
It
<BR>
appears that much mild cooling may be nearly as good. 
<BR>
<P>Dr. Myron Ginsberg of the University of Miami noticed that when scientists
<BR>
clamped arteries in rats' brains to study the amount of damage that resulted,
<BR>
no
<BR>
two experiments ever seemed to turn out the same. 
<BR>
<P>In time, he figured out why. Slight differences in the temperature of the
<BR>
rats'
<BR>
brains, resulting from things like the lab temperature and air currents, had
<BR>
ahuge impact on the extent of the animals' strokes. The cooler the brain, it
<BR>
turned out, the smaller the stroke. But even a modest drop in temperature
<BR>
seemed
<BR>
to be highly protective, while a little extra heat made things vastly worse. 
<BR>
<P>In a cool head, enzymes stop working. Oxygen consumption slows. Glucose
<BR>
metabolism plummets. The processes of cell death shut down. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Two or three degrees of temperature change every biological system known to
<BR>
man, often by 100 percent,&quot; says Dr. Alister Buchon of the University of
<BR>
Calgary. &quot;We evolved at this temperature. We don't work if we lower it.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Ginsberg says his experiments suggest an ideal target for stroke treatment:
<BR>
Lower body temperature by about 5 degrees Celsius from the normal 37.5, start
<BR>
the treatment within three or four hours and hold down the temperature for 24
<BR>
to
<BR>
36 hours. 
<BR>
<P>Doctors consider this to be mild hypothermia, and they hope patients will be
<BR>
able to stand it while conscious. Possibilities include giving them mild
<BR>
sedatives and warming their skin while catheters chill their blood. 
<BR>
<P>However, the cold catheters have never been used on a person, so no one
<BR>
reallyknows how the human body will react to having its blood cooled. Some
<BR>
speculate
<BR>
that if the skin stays warm, the brain will be fooled into thinking all is
<BR>
balmy. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;It makes sense that some of the body's negative reaction to hypothermia
<BR>
wouldpossibly not be seen if the cooling comes from within,&quot; says Connolly.
<BR>
&quot;The body
<BR>
has no defense mechanism against that, because there is no environmental
<BR>
equivalent.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Many doctors agree that if cooling works, it will have to be done quickly,
<BR>
before the stroke runs its irreversible course. This will mean starting it as
<BR>
soon as suspected stroke patients arrive at the emergency room, or perhaps
<BR>
even
<BR>
before. Some suggest ambulance crews might insert a cooling catheter on the
<BR>
way
<BR>
to the hospital. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's going to turn out to be useful,&quot; predicts Dr. Steven Grannotta of the
<BR>
University of Southern California. &quot;The problem is, how are we going to
<BR>
deliver
<BR>
the cooling in the quickest, safest and most efficient way?&quot;
