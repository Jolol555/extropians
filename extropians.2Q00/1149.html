<P>...or of stopping it long before it becomes &quot;mass&quot;.  I'd like it if every

high school had some kind of gun-owner club, whose members carried handguns
<BR>
on their persons all day.  Any sign of recklessness and a student would be

expelled from the club.  That way, if some wackos want to kill 13 people,
<BR>
they'll probably be killed after the first couple shots they fire, by
<BR>
fellow students.  And, while we're at it, if some 15-year-old girls are
<BR>
going into the city to watch a movie, I'd sure want them to have guns, even
<BR>
if their training is only minimal.  Last time I checked, rapists didn't go
<BR>
out of their way to avoid minors.  But they probably do prefer to avoid guns.
