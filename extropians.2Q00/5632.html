your mind and it's unlikely you will change mine; so it's a useless
<BR>
argument. I think, in general, the US' position towards guns leads to a
<BR>
decrease in security and quality of life; you disagree and think it's the
<BR>
guns that keep you safe. The end.
<BR>
<P>You guys are seriously deluded if you think that the citizens of the States
<BR>
have a generally pro-gun attitude.  Last I checked, more and more gun
<BR>
rights were being lost each year.  Last I checked, Rosie O'Donnell's career
<BR>
actually improved as a result of her ignorant and hypocritical anti-gun
<BR>
stance.
<BR>
<P>If you're saying that you're a supporter of the people who are actively
<BR>
trying to prevent me from owning guns, which I feel will be necessary to
<BR>
defend myself from either criminals or a tyrannical government, and if
<BR>
nothing I say will change your mind, then it's most certainly not &quot;the
<BR>
end.&quot;  A potential rape victim may try to change her attacker's mind, but
<BR>
when that doesn't work she may adopt a new course of action.

The Beyond outside us is indeed swept away, and the

great undertaking of the Enlightenment complete;

but the Beyond *inside* us has become a new heaven

and calls us to renewed heaven-storming.
