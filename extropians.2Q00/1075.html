<EM>&gt;The pyramid-scheme analogy was made by some eminent pundit in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Times a month or so ago. The interesting thing though is it's an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;emergent pyramid - one that's just popped into being rather than being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deliberately designed. I like the idea of an unconscious, collective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fraud.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Each investor acts rationally: if I think a stock with .com in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;title but no real value will go up because everyone else is an idiot,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then it makes perfect sense to buy. I just want to make money. Buying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;makes even more sense if I figure enough other people are reasoning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the same way, which has certainly seemed true over the last couple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If enough people bid in then the prophesy fulfills itself and the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reasoning is yet more justified the next time round. It's a crock, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I _know_ it's a crock, but locally the correct thing to do is buy. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;globally crazy result is the outcome of millions of independently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sensible decisions - insanity emerges.

A similar kind of individual/collective betting goes on in other areas, such 
<BR>
as mob behavior, or in the general level of trust or morality in a society.  
<BR>
If you expect other people to rip you off at the first opportunity, then you 
<BR>
behave very differently than if you assume that everyone is honest, except 
<BR>
for the rare minority of criminals.  Real problems occur for people 
<BR>
transitioning from one culture to an opposite one, whether high trust to low 
<BR>
or vice-versa.
<BR>
<P>This is one of the major problems that American inner city blacks have in 
<BR>
moving up in the largely white-dominated business and social world of 
<BR>
America.  They have learned to respond and expect response based on an 
<BR>
extremely low-trust society.  The whites - and other blacks who are in 
<BR>
transition - have also probably been burned or know people personally who 
<BR>
have been burned by the large crew of professional con artist blacks who 
<BR>
have used their fund of knowledge of crime to take advantage of the higher 
<BR>
trust society.
<BR>
<P>Thus, the former ghetto black finds himself not trusted in the high trust 
<BR>
society, plus he misinterprets much of what goes on in terms of his prior 
<BR>
experience.  On the other hand, the naive white who operates as if in a 
<BR>
high-trust society in the ghetto gets a very swift and expensive lesson, if 
<BR>
he or she lives long enough to learn it.
