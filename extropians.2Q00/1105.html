<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Modern democracies are just a degenerate form of the monarchial system?  For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; reasons stated above I would have to disagree.  I can see some connection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; but not the wholesale link you do.  I appreciate having the vast power one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; man used to have as king being spread around with various branches of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; government that are limited by checks and balances.  And we can try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; influence or change things without being hung or imprisoned if the king
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; really dislikes the idea.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Charlie still lives under a system where the head of state IS in fact a monarch,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and his system has no written constitution that recognises that all rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; originate in the individual, who delegates them to the government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not quite correct.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There _is_ a constitution in the UK; it's just that instead of being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; written in one single piece of paper, it's written in a number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different places. For example, as of last year there's a Bill of Rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that overrides all other legislation. (Yeah, I know it's disgraceful that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it took them that long to implement one, but at least it's there now!)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A secondary consideration is that the UK constitution is less well defined,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and therefore easier to change, than the US one. Passing the bill of rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was a routine legislative act; ditto abolishing the voting powers of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hereditary peers in the House of Lords. This is, IMO, a Bad Thing, and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good reason for supporting Charter 88 (the campaign for a written
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constitution that overrides ordinary legislation and has a separate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amendment process).
</EM><BR>
<P>I certainly hope you guys get one. Its about time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, it'd be a mistake to think that the UK is, *in practice*, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Monarchy. Theoretically, Lizzie Saxe-Coburg-Gotha has the power to tell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tony Blair to go fuck himself. In practice, the first time she did it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be the last -- and Tony would still be in Number 10 Downing Street
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when the dust settled. The royal family is so far divorced from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legal entity that is The Crown that they don't actually control it any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more -- arguably, they haven't since 1832.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is that what their real last name is? I'd wondered. I thought calling themselves 'the
<BR>
Windsors' was a bit too much of a pose. Is the Gotha from Prince Phillip?
<BR>
<P>If Tony Blair tossed over the Queen if she got 'uppity', he definitely could get away
<BR>
with it, but would it be legal? I don't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I do think I understand your point as being that ultimately, the federal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; gov'ts of even democracies still have incredible power over the citizenry,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; even if it is generally more fairly used.  And we are expected as citizens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be generally loyal subjects to not a king anymore, but our flag and p.m.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; or president.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In which I agree with Charlie is totally wrong. The Constitution is the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thing that deserves or gets my loyalty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That wasn't really my point, anyway. My point was that the power structures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that replaced the authoritarian monarchs may have notionally derived their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; authority from the people rather than &quot;because God _said_ I was better than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you peasants&quot;, but *it's still a power structure*, with many of the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attributes and relationships to the outside world.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, however it subsumes that power structure under the authority of the people,
<BR>
rather than the other way around. They can change that power structure if they have
<BR>
sufficient will to do so, and theoretically thats what they do every election (I know,
<BR>
thats a real funny one Mike). Theoretically, the people now have the right to
<BR>
eliminate that power structure entirely, legally.
