<P>Re: your scenario - the following scenario.
<BR>
<P>The problem is not the transparent society; it's the state.  In the only 
<BR>
kind of meta-stable society - one that can survive long-term past the 
<BR>
singularity - the monopoloy state and its police have been replaced by more 
<BR>
effective and less bothersome means.
<BR>
<P>In general, in such a society, while someone could indeed act in response to 
<BR>
a (mis)perceived threat, your recourse would be to demand compensation for 
<BR>
the costs you incurred due to their error, innocent or otherwise.  Probably 
<BR>
your insurance agency would compensate you up front and then examine how to 
<BR>
dun the offenders in the best way for them.
<BR>
<P>Also, while preventative measures might indeed be taken, depending upon how 
<BR>
seriously someone took the perceived threat, any report of such suspicious 
<BR>
activity might first bring a call or visit from your insurance inspector, as 
<BR>
they would be hit for the costs if you did in fact commit a terrorist act.  
<BR>
If it was just an AI mistake, then no problem.  If you habitually did things 
<BR>
that triggered investigations, then eventually your insurance agency might 
<BR>
notify you of a rate increase to cover their additional costs, or they might 
<BR>
just average it in.
<BR>
<P>In addition to the insurance call or investigation, there might well be 
<BR>
free-lancers checking up on you in the hopes of catching a would-be 
<BR>
terrorist and collecting on rewards posted by the various insurance agencies 
<BR>
for information regarding premium fraud artists, such as guys with basement 
<BR>
nukes or secret biocapable nanoassemblers, who could not hope to pay a high 
<BR>
enough premium to cover the risks they secretly imposed on their neighbors.  
<BR>
These people would be shut down in short order.
<BR>
<P>I suspect that the actual number of such violations would be fairly minimal. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With real transparency and accountability, it would be as unnecessary as 
<BR>
it is unjust to punish someone on the theory of deterence, or on the basis 
<BR>
that for every crime successfully caught and prosecuted, fifty others get 
<BR>
away.  Punishment, as such, itself only works to the extent that it deters 
<BR>
future crime, and it doesn't do that very efficiently.  How much better to 
<BR>
charge actual costs to those responsible.
<BR>
<P>Instead of taxes for hit-or-miss Skinnerian justice, the price of knowledge 
<BR>
would be factored into the actuarial costs of your insurance premiums.  
<BR>
There would be an always shifting actuarial breaking even point in terms of 
<BR>
absolute knowledge versus total risk, a marginal returns function that 
<BR>
through good analytical tools and competition among providers would tend to 
<BR>
optimize the cost of ensuring reasonable safety.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A possible scenario in a transparent society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I currently live on an acre lot, large lawn and about a third of the lot is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wooded.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the scenario:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;One day I happen to have an argument with my boss (I happen to work in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;federal building) We occasionally have differences of opinion the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;difference is now we live in a &quot;Transparent Society&quot; with ubiquitous 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveilance and AI watching it all happen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;On my way home I stop and get fertilizer for my lawn cause its spring and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its time to get out in the yard.  I also stop and get a couple gallons of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gas for my chainsaw because I need to cut up the tree limbs that have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fallen due to the winter storms. While I'm at it I get a large rain barrell 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because I want to save on my water bill and use rainwater (I live near 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Seattle) to water my gardens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;All in and of themselves innocent things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However the AI, not yet being able to read my mind alerts the Police who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are sent to investigate why I have purchased the makings of a bomb so 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recently after having had an argument with my boss.  The police are also 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unable to read my mind, but checking past records they would be able to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;determine that I have been in the military, have once purchased a copy of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Anarchist cookbook, and occasionally veiwed websites on Anarchy.  They 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are unable to determine (No mind reading tech yet) that my actual 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;miotivations for these things were Duty, curiosity, and academic research 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(in that order).  Being an innocent civilian I ought never be subject to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this kind of questioning in the first place, yet (In the interest of public 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;safety)I find myself in just such a position.  What do the police officers 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do now, take my word that I intend no harm and hope that I am not deceiving 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them. Confiscate the &quot;Bomb&quot; making material depriving me of its use for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;harmless purposes, or maybe they ought to !
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arrest me as a potential threat to public safety.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't have an answer to these questions, they however give me reason to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be extremely wary of &quot;Transparent Society&quot;
</EM><BR>
