<EM>&gt; Wouldn't this plan basically require you to &quot;customize&quot; the book for every 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; single person who downloaded it?  In effect giving everybody a slightly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different version of the story?

<BR>
Yes. It's not difficult; Peanut Press do it today. (Their approach is to
<BR>
use a proprietary reader and encrypt the files. To stop you passing 'em
<BR>
out, the encryption key is the credit card number and name you paid with.
<BR>
Very sneaky; trouble is, it's a pain to enter a 16-digit number, and
<BR>
what if you card expires or is replaced by a new one? I suspect they didn't
<BR>
talk to Visa or MC about this scheme ...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How much bite do you think there would be in the collection agency threat?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's pretty much the same threat that software vendors use to prevent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; piracy.  Lotta good its done them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, it works &quot;well enough&quot;. There isn't enough money in ripping off
<BR>
someone's e-fiction for it to be a moneyspinner, like, say, selling fake
<BR>
Windows 2000 CD's for $200 a pop. (I mean, I'm sure Damien's book _is_
<BR>
worth $200 a copy, but they might not see it that way ;-) All you're
<BR>
really worried about is idiots with web servers, and the threat alone
<BR>
should be sufficient in 95% of cases. In those where it isn't, well,
<BR>
debt collection agencies shut down the US junk fax business, didn't
<BR>
they? Give 'em 50% of the fee in return for collecting it and they'll
<BR>
hassle the idiots until they take the book off their server. (Which is
<BR>
the reason for the $2 download fee -- it clicks up the amount they owe
<BR>
you the longer they do it.)
