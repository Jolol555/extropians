<P>As much as I loathe Marxism, I disagree with the above.  I know quite a few
<BR>
leftists, who occasionally associate themselves with Marxism.  They often
<BR>
refer to wealthy businessmen as exploitative, but rarely doctors, athletes,
<BR>
or entertainers.  An example of what I see: They ponder the fact that so
<BR>
many pharmaceutical CEOs have been vastly richer than Jonas Salk, and the
<BR>
reach the intuitive conclusion that this is vastly unfair.  My conclusion
<BR>
is that they're just ignorant of how a market works, and therefore cannot
<BR>
understand the real value produced by a banker, venture capitalist, etc.,
<BR>
or why it might be much greater than the value produced by a doctor or
<BR>
factory worker.  When it's Salk or John Lennon, by contrast, they can
<BR>
perceive the value he produced, without any study of economics.  This, BTW,
<BR>
would explain why Lennon was rarely accused of hypocrisy, though basically
<BR>
a filthy rich Marxist.  Most supporters of Marxism aren't envious.  They're
<BR>
more like economically stupid libertarians, who fail to identify production
<BR>
in most of the places it exists, and then conclude that it must really be
<BR>
parasitism.

We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients. 
<BR>
But we can't scoff at them personally, to their 
<BR>
faces, and this is what annoys me.
