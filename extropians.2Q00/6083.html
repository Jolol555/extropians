<P><EM>&gt; I imagine, from the way you have conducted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself here, that you are the sort of person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who gives thanks every day for the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; duels are no longer legal means of settling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal disputes of honor. If you conduct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself in your real interpersonal relations as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you have here, I would imagine that you would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not last long in such an environment.
</EM><BR>
<P>What a despicable thing to say. I conduct myself the same
<BR>
everywhere, and I've never been involved in any physical
<BR>
violence in my life.
<BR>
<P>I have received death threats, however, which is part of why
<BR>
your comments are so chilling to me. You are saying, in effect,
<BR>
&quot;this is someone whose behavior would be seen by many as worthy
<BR>
of death (or sufficient injury to no longer be 'lasting').&quot;
<BR>
<P>How insensitive, unproductive, and one-sided. If what you say is
<BR>
true, the people with such views are the ones in error.
<BR>
<P>Worse still, is this (note that this sentence followed the
<BR>
previous, in the same paragraph):
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The idea that you think you can so offhandedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make personal aspersions about a mans wife
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and expect no adverse repercussions just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boggles the mind.
</EM><BR>
<P>First, I did not expect no repercussions. Second, it was not
<BR>
offhanded. Finally, the property orientation towards Natasha is
<BR>
not one I had in the forefront of my mind. She's an independent
<BR>
human being who treated me badly, I did the same back. What's
<BR>
the big deal?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you wish to retain any place here, I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emphatically suggest you make a sincere and full
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apology to both Max and Natasha and let the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussion drop at that.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm the one owed apologies, by an increasing number of people
<BR>
(now you).
<BR>
<P>Whether I owe any, beyond those already given, I'm not yet sure.
<BR>
It's a difficult ethical matter I'm putting much careful thought
<BR>
into (unlike most others who have felt capable of chiming in
<BR>
here).
<BR>
<P>-Brian.
