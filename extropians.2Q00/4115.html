<EM>&gt;     I have to admit I never expected to see anyone trash Mother Teresa.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Who's next Gandhi?  MLK?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure..
<BR>
Both of these individuals, while (in my opinion) leaving the world a better 
<BR>
place then it was when they entered it, certainly had flaws. Off the top of 
<BR>
my head: Gandhi was having sex at the exact moment his father died (I think 
<BR>
it was his father). When he found out this fact, he vowed chastity for the 
<BR>
rest of his life. He would sleep in the same bed as naked virgins, to prove 
<BR>
(to others or himself?) that he was beyond temptation. There's nothing noble 
<BR>
about this.. whatever he did for India, Gandhi was a fucked up guy, and 
<BR>
shouldn't be an example to anyone of how to live your life. Read Salmon 
<BR>
Rushdie's article on him in Time magazine for more info (I think it was in a 
<BR>
&quot;people of the century&quot; type of issue). MLK is justly a hero for being the 
<BR>
individual most responsible for the end of apartheid in this country, but 
<BR>
had a nearly (perhaps completely) socialist approach to politics, and would 
<BR>
have caused an enourmous amount of poverty and suffering in this country if 
<BR>
he'd ever been elected to a public office with a lot of influence. His 
<BR>
nonviolent &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; message was an effective method at the 
<BR>
time he was preaching it, mainly I think because of the power of television, 
<BR>
but the same ideas applied in other periods of history would have had 
<BR>
hideous results. His legacy could be used to perpetuate the myth that its 
<BR>
more noble to lie down and be crushed under tyrany then to defend yourself. 
<BR>
I think Malcolm X's ideas were much more philosophically admirable. While 
<BR>
still based in religion, he had the attitude that &quot;nobody gives you freedom. 
<BR>
If you're a man, you take it&quot; (that's a quote as best I can remember). His 
<BR>
response to economic inujustice was to encourage blacks to build their own 
<BR>
economies. This is much more healthy for the individual then MLK's strategy 
<BR>
of integrating the black community, by force of law, into an american south 
<BR>
which resented them, in order to acheive a shallow harmony. Ask any African 
<BR>
American friend you have if he feels much a sense of accomplishment at 
<BR>
getting a job when he knows he was only hired as a token to satisfy 
<BR>
affirmative action.
<BR>
<P>I've been thinking a lot about the Mother Theresa debate. I'm not quite sure 
<BR>
how I feel about it. I feel no resentment towards her, as she did not ever 
<BR>
use force to attain her goals. The person who said that anyone joining her 
<BR>
was, &quot;in effect&quot;, a slave, is wrong. They had as much autonomy as anyone 
<BR>
else, they were there by choice. If it was a fautly set of premises which 
<BR>
kept them in her service (it was), they were still fully free to abandon 
<BR>
them. I can't really say that Mother Theresa was &quot;evil&quot;, but I can say that 
<BR>
in a world where people were a little smarter, she would have been left with 
<BR>
nothing to do, and that she really didn't accomplish anything in her life. 
<BR>
Telling a dying person that everything is going to be ok, because a god will 
<BR>
grant him a place in an imaginary heaven if he just grovels before him to 
<BR>
ask forgiveness for the sin of being born, is not an accomplishment.
