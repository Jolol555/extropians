<P>Roger all that.  Ive been lurking on a wearables list and have been toying
<BR>
with the idea of a borganism kind of sitch, a global brain, where volunteers
<BR>
would wear wireless camera glasses and offer one's current view of the
<BR>
world to anyone else in the borg.  You would remove them in your house
<BR>
of course, or when you were visiting Mike Lorrey.  {8-]  Or when you
<BR>
were in the john.  Or I guess you could just not look down then.  {8^D

<P>That all-information-all-the-time business really gets me jazzed.

<P>Me too.  Constant connection to the internet would be like tacking
<BR>
on about 30 IQ points.  I could get up into the normal range.  Well,
<BR>
depending on where you surf of course.  Might subtract 30.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Wireless is just the first baby step.  How can that *not* be a cool thing?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds wicked cool to me.  {8-]  spike
