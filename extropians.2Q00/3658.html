<P><EM>&gt;&gt; The choice is indeed very difficult, if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; don't fall for the idiotic and dangerous idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; that voting for someone with no chance of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; winning achieves anything positive.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hmm. A vote is an expression of preference.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I choose to express my preference for a minority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; candidate, that preference is duly recorded and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reported, and the total of these votes may well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; influence the particular positions of major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; candidates in the future.  I would consider this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a &quot;positive&quot; result, while I would consider no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one ever hearing my real opinions because I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chose to lie about them to be one of the unheard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; masses who voted for a popular candidate to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;negative&quot; result.  Do you have a different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evaluation of those outcomes?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Indeed, not only do I have a different evaluation of the
<BR>
outcomes of the two options you mention, but I believe these are
<BR>
not the only two that should be considered.
<BR>
<P>There's so far very little evidence that the small number of
<BR>
people who have voted for a third party candidate in a U.S.
<BR>
presidential election have altered the actual policies of any of
<BR>
the major candidates, at least in recent times. It's altered
<BR>
rhetoric to some degree, sure, but very little else.
<BR>
<P>In any event, the first question about the purpose of voting is
<BR>
about the nature of the problem we seek to solve with our vote:
<BR>
is it formal, or substantive? That is, is the problem the (de
<BR>
facto) two party system, or is the problem that there is a
<BR>
PARTICULAR candidate we want elected who is better than those of
<BR>
either of the Big Two parties?
<BR>
<P>You seem to think it's the latter. I think it's the former. (I
<BR>
also think the latter is a problem; and you probably also think
<BR>
the former is a problem to some degree.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is contrary to the goals of the voting process
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to suggest that one should deliberately lie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about one's preference. What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the benefit of voting for a winner?
</EM><BR>
<P>This isn't under discussion (you mean &quot;_having_ voted for a
<BR>
winner?&quot;). We're talking about the pre-election decision about
<BR>
voting for someone you would LIKE to see win, and who you think
<BR>
has a significance chance of winning.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do I win something?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Money?  Bragging rights?  No, I win a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shitty government.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not always.
<BR>
<P>In my view, the goal is 1) to elect the best of the viable
<BR>
options, with respect to particular issues that matter
<BR>
(stem-cell research, etc.); and, FAR more importantly, 2) to
<BR>
elect somone who will increase the odds that the two-party
<BR>
system will (eventually) break down, in order that the
<BR>
conditions for the solution to the SUBSTANTIVE problem will
<BR>
finally come about.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A vote is a moral duty because it affects how an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agency of force chooses to exercise that force
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against the people.
</EM><BR>
<P>Or against people who want to exercise force against people....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  A voter who chooses to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shirk that duty by hiding his true prefence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; among a sea of conformity, despite there being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no possible benefit to him or anyone else in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing so, is not worthy of respect.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hm.... okay, well, I suppose there's little point in discussing
<BR>
this further then.
<BR>
<P>Good luck (See Hegel's _Phenomenology of Mind_ for more, in a
<BR>
highly theoretical vein, on the formal/substantive question),
<BR>
Brian.
