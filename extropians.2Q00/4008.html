<P>The genetic modification of human beings should be banned until more is known 
<BR>
about the science, according to a leading genetic scientist. 
<BR>
Eric Lander, who is director of the Whitehead Institute at the Massachusetts 
<BR>
Institute of Technology, said there was nothing stopping scientists 
<BR>
experimenting but he would be &quot;appalled&quot; if they did. 
<BR>
<P>I would be appalled to wake up and find that someone had produced the first 
<BR>
genetically-modified child
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Professor Eric Lander  
<BR>
<P>During a lecture, sponsored by Nature magazine, at the Hay-on-Wye literary 
<BR>
festival in Powys, mid-Wales, he said the ban need not necessarily be 
<BR>
permanent. 
<BR>
<P>But, he said, it should be kept in place until more is known about what is 
<BR>
involved. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;At present there is nothing stopping anyone from doing this type of thing,&quot; 
<BR>
he said. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;But I would be appalled to wake up and find that someone had produced the 
<BR>
first genetically-modified child. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;We should ban the genetic modification of humans for now, with the 
<BR>
understanding that we would still be able to come back to the issue later.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Human Genome Project 
<BR>
<P>Professor Lander - whose institute has been responsible for 30% of the 
<BR>
results in the Human Genome Project which is studying the genetic make-up of 
<BR>
human beings - said the first draft of the human genome sequence would be 
<BR>
published this autumn. 
<BR>
<P>The project, he added, was the biological equivalent of the chemical table of 
<BR>
elements. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Just as the table of elements completely changed our understanding of 
<BR>
chemistry, when you know all the components (of the human genome) and the 
<BR>
complex relationships between them, it changes everything,&quot; he explained. 
<BR>
<P>Mr Lander said explained that the &quot;revolution&quot; in the understanding of 
<BR>
biological processes resulting from the project was already being used in 
<BR>
world-wide laboratories every day
