<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Hi transhumans (also to posthumans, extropians &amp; neohumans e-lists).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;What do you think of  the World transhumanist Association ..... ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I think their magazine at www.transhumanism.com is OK, and possibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;important, but a bit &quot;flat.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Yes, it is. It's the usual 'science without art' fiasco. Dry.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;OK. First of all: it's all only got pictures of men, no women. What do you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expect? (only partly kidding =o)
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting about absence of women in the trans/ extropian firmament .... I
<BR>
find the opposite is true in some new age/ occult arenas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I've always been a little surprised there's not more creativity involved in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these things myself. More playfulness!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I always expect visual ambiance, pictures of architecture, spaceships, VR,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stories, people in action, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly. I hope this is what Extropia can bring.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This in comparison to most of what's out there is amazingly aesthetic!
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But seriously, if you go beyond it's boring prospectus brochure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;typesetting and look at links, (!!!) Extropy.com or Anders website  -- you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might find a bit more &quot;Flash&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I wonder why it doesn't link to any of the especially creative Natasha's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sites, or am I missing something... I suggest you visit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.extropic-art.com">http://www.extropic-art.com</A> for a more compelling and exotic view of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transhumans....
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, have already been contacted by some other trans/ post-human sites who
<BR>
want links to Extropia.
<BR>
<P>Thanks to all those who have e-mailed me expressing support .... I promise
<BR>
that some of the new content I have been sent will go up today or tomorrow.
<BR>
Please send links and stuff as well to Extropia so we can all stay in touch.

<BR>
<P>This is exactly the point. The journal of transhumanism was set up to
<BR>
be as scholarly as possible, with peer review, demands for correct
<BR>
citations and all the other academic trappings. The goal was to work
<BR>
on academically respectable transhumanism, not to be a general
<BR>
transhumanist magazine (there are after all others better suited for
<BR>
that).
<BR>
<P>Fine .... this was my surmise about the WTA journal.
<BR>
<P>Although compared to most of the scientific journals out there it is a
<BR>
laughing, sparkling festival of jokes. :-)
<BR>
<P>Scientists do have an image problem it seems .....
<BR>
<P>As for the science bias in JoT and transhumanism in general, I think
<BR>
it is mostly due to the lack of good treatment of &quot;soft&quot;
<BR>
subjects. There is no doubt that a lot of psychology and other forms
<BR>
of metaprogramming are *necessary* for us to self-transform, but
<BR>
honestly the field is a hopeless mess of theories, useful tricks,
<BR>
hype, uncertain and untestable methods and of course downright
<BR>
erroneous claims. Fishing up the good stuff is hard.
<BR>
<P>I think we agree here. My approach is very interdisciplinary and
<BR>
boundary-crossing, and Extropia will tend to focus on exactly the areas you
<BR>
outline (plus posthuman arts &amp; more 'personal' content).
<BR>
<P>Ascend!

<P>Call me a killjoy (although _not_ a Bill Joy !-) if you want, but I find

the listed web locations

<BR>
<P>somewhat lacking to say the least...
<BR>
<P>Please bear with me .....Since the launch YESTERDAY I have been busily
<BR>
collating new material that should be up later tonite. These sites are
<BR>
currently just entry portals pointing to Extropia magazine, not the e-zine
<BR>
itself!
<BR>
<P>In fact, they appear to me as a yell for Anchluss of all transhumanism and
<BR>
extropianism to a kind of occultism.
<BR>
<P>Probably the other way around! I am trying to pull the occult fraternity in
<BR>
a post-human direction.
<BR>
<P>My bogometer gives a bright red alarm after reading the pages: Qabbala,
<BR>
occultism, Enochial chess,
<BR>
<P><P>Where is the page called &quot;Qabbala&quot; ... am not aware of it on any of my
<BR>
sites. Enochian Chess isn't on the posthuman pages, but at another site or
<BR>
pages of a site entirely. The C19th Golden Dawn adept, McGregor Mathers
<BR>
(Enochian Chess innovator) , exhorted us to be &quot;more than human&quot; which I
<BR>
think counts him as being posthuman ...... do you disagree?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;third eye (aka ``Phantom Eye Hypothesis'' and ``Median Vision Theory''),
<BR>
dreams, etc.  Heretical philosophy, indeed..
<BR>
<P>MVT is very much a heresy against conventionalism ... per force, since it is
<BR>
new.  Do you disagree with me that the transition from the E-2 brain to the
<BR>
E-1 brain (on loss of the pineal eye) represents a change from a
<BR>
finite-state to an infinite-state system ('analog' consciousness such as we
<BR>
experience requires the loss of the external clock/ pineal eye so that the
<BR>
E-1 circuit can self-organise)?
<BR>
<P>I am careful to point out that 'third' eye is a misnomer, since it predates
<BR>
lateral eyes. Dreams are &quot;phenomena&quot; aren't they ..... or don't you have
<BR>
them?????? Aren't you interested in evolutionary reasons for REM, Globus,
<BR>
Axelrod &amp;c (scientists, not occultists). These are the issues in MVT, which
<BR>
is a natural, scientific theory, grounded in replicable experiements.
<BR>
<P>I hereby label those web pages as ``new age fluff''. &gt;WHAM&lt;
<BR>
<P>What is post/trans/ extropian/neohuman movement about if not the &quot;new age&quot;
<BR>
.... and how we can best create it. Your label says as much  about your own
<BR>
cognitive processes and bias than it accurately describes MVT pages. &gt; Like
<BR>
the sound effect though!&lt;
<BR>
<P>So please send in some 'substantial' hard-science contribution &amp;c. to make
<BR>
sure Extropia doesn't become too fluffy and out-there...... I have a very
<BR>
encyclopedic and non-prescriptive philosophy of editing.
<BR>
<P>Caveat lector.
