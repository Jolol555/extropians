<P>&lt;&lt;  actually do the same kind of genre hopping quite seamlessly, so I know
<BR>
&nbsp;what you mean.  In fact, people who are used to me as one easily
<BR>
&nbsp;identified group often show quite a bit of surprise when they see me in
<BR>
&nbsp;one of my other natural guises. &gt;&gt;&quot;
<BR>
<P>I didnt write that, that was James Rogers. 
<BR>
<P>Anyway, you continue:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now to change the subject swiftly: I have seen various comments you
<BR>
have 
<BR>
made about diet and exercise.  I believe you were showing interest in life 
<BR>
extension and health improvement.  Have you looked at the work of Ronald M. 
<BR>
Klatz, MD with HGH?  He is on line and has a book called HGH, I believe.  In
<BR>
<P>addition I saw some ads in MD that implied you could reconstruct his program
<BR>
<P>for yourself at a much lower cost.  I decided to not pursue his program at 
<BR>
this time.  The second program that I thought might interest you is the REAL
<BR>
<P>AGE program.  Both of these have pages on line.&quot;
<BR>
<P>My personal opinion, given the lack of credible studies with HGH on healthy
<BR>
adults, is wait a bit longer and see what develops.  I'd rather err on the
<BR>
side of caution when messing with my hormones, though I'm not opposed to it.
<BR>
<P>I did do the Real Age test and did quit well.  Anybody wanna compare scores?
<BR>
I think I prety much maxed it out.  The only things I'm not doing is driving
<BR>
a safer car and having airbags in it.  I also dont have enough close
<BR>
friends, according to them.  But Dang! when you're an extropian it's kinda
<BR>
hard to put up with &quot;normal&quot; people ya know? :-)
<BR>
<P>Heres how I scored
<BR>
<P>Chronological age: 35.3
<BR>
&quot;Real&quot; age:		 23.6
<BR>
difference:		 -11.7 yrs
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; As an old sailor I can't help but pick at a Marine.  So let me proceed;
<BR>
<P>in the 1950s I was in a Navy program in which our entire basic training, 
<BR>
except classroom training, was under the direct control and direction of 
<BR>
Marines.  I had a Marine DI, Sargeant Long, just as you did.  Can you name 
<BR>
the program?  And no, we were not being punished.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Whoa.  Thats a leeetle bit before my time. I served from '86-'90.  But at
<BR>
that time Navy ROTC cadets did go through a 6 week &quot;bulldog&quot; course at Brown
<BR>
Field, OCS, Quantico, VA. as a sort of character builder before embarking
<BR>
upon a coffe drinking, donut eating life of luxury on some ship or shore
<BR>
station (Ha! :-))
<BR>
<P>Yours in Naval Service,
<BR>
