</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Of course, for those who feel this is far too compromising, there will in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the future the option to go to the oceans or also outer space to found the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;type of communities that radical libertarians and extropians dream of.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wish you all luck and in time may join you, but for now please understand 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if I feel pride and a touch of emotion when I see the American flag waving 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the wind.

<P>John, I think it's ok to be patriotic, obviously the secret is moderation, 
<BR>
I'm also proud of my country, customs and culture, and I think patriotism 
<BR>
is basic in my nation so we can get rid of  corrupt, murderous and 
<BR>
power-hungry governments. that describes exactly how our goverment is, in 
<BR>
my case being a patriotic mexican, I want democracy, civil liberties and a 
<BR>
legal system that gives us better human rights, so I actually think that 
<BR>
moderate patriotism isn't that bad, although I'd still love to see our 
<BR>
entire continent united like a single nation, respecting the cultural 
<BR>
differences and customs of each country, although we are still far from 
<BR>
that, however I predict that if we get rid of the pri, and our economy 
<BR>
becomes as competitive as it should be our level of cooperation with our 
<BR>
nothern and southern neighboors won't have precedents.
<BR>
<P>There have been already talks about entering to a second phase in the nafta 
<BR>
that allows free migration of workers and profesionals among our countries, 
<BR>
I think something like that would be great not just for mexico, but to the 
<BR>
states and canada as well
