<EM>&gt; &gt; Interesting.  So, if you were blindfolded, do you think you could smell 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; difference between a Japanese and a Mexican and tell us which was which?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think so, though I am not 100% positive.  As I said, this is something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've noticed; my aggregate sample size may not be large enough to mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything, although my samples do cover a broad range of ethnic groups.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do know of other people who have noticed the same thing though.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well I know I can smell the differences of the members of my family.  And I 
<BR>
have noticed a particular smell emanating from some Asians (only to later 
<BR>
determine it was just &quot;garlic breath&quot;) and back when blacks were wearing 
<BR>
their hair in the &quot;Jheri curl&quot; style you could smell that stuff from a mile 
<BR>
away.  But other than that, I've never noticed any race-specific smells.  
<BR>
Although I've never done any conscious comparisons -- and I believe I have a 
<BR>
less acute sense of smell than most.
