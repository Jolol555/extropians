<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; did SAS kill dissidents? ... check

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Please note the distinction between peaceful dissidents and armed

<EM>&gt; &gt; terrorists.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When the government has the authority to restrict your ability to practice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; peaceful protest and demonstration, and uses it, why do you wonder that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the result is armed insurrection? You leave them no choice. When you've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got no other options, and nothing left to lose, violence IS a viable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; option. If you are a member of the population that supports a government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that opresses people this way, you deserve to become a target. Violent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rebellion is a very direct indicator of how free segments of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population are. Those that refuse to acknowledge and understand this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deserve their fate.
</EM><BR>
<P>And if you don't wish to uphold the current government, what do you do?
<BR>
<P>Protes... oh, *right*, I get it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there an Official Secrets Act? ... check  (and how is the FOI Act
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; any different? New name the same dog?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And the US, of course, keeps no official secrets?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How many newspapers have given a ratts behind, or can legally be forced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the government, to not print something just because the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't want it to? The Official Secrets Act gives the PM the authority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to censor any paper on national security grounds, perfectly legally,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and prosecute anyone who doesn't obey. That can't happen here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Wasn't it you who criticised me once before, suggesting I thought I knew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the whole story about everything that goes on?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The way the government handles things here is through propaganda,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manipulation, and disinformation. While the question of whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is better than overt government orders is obviously a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question to debate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed. I'd much prefer the overt government orders and laws, which at
<BR>
least then have things set out clearly. Such as with the issue of
<BR>
encryption in email - the new UK laws say you must, if ordered, hand
<BR>
over your encryption keys (and it's up to *you* to prove you *don't* have
<BR>
keys for a given piece of encrypted data, which needless to say is
<BR>
dubious - and meets problems with the European Human Rights regs, in
<BR>
terms of not being able to force someone to incriminate themselves).
<BR>
<P>In the scenario where the government and laws are (supposedly) the
<BR>
fair and informed choice of the people, I'd much rather an honest
<BR>
statement of what one's rights *are*, so that one knows, and people have
<BR>
the opportunity to do something about those arrangements if they don't
<BR>
like them.
<BR>
<P>The US hasn't ever clearly set out whether they can force you or
<BR>
threaten you to get you to give them an encryption key - although it
<BR>
wouldn't surprise me at all if things came to the crunch and someone was
<BR>
being made to when it came to court. Problems arise because they don't
<BR>
know where they stand (can they be forced to? Is there anyone who
<BR>
*cares*?). And if there's nothing in the laws about it, how can anyone
<BR>
fight to change it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Would you cut all taxation? Make all public services optional private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ones?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure, why not?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Including policing? (threads merge...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but not privatize as a distinct authority to a corporation, but a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distributed, decentralized policing done by the citizens themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, no taxation, no public services, private (and not even centralised)
<BR>
policing.
<BR>
<P>I'm not criticising that conclusion, but personally, I'd consider such
<BR>
an arrangement not much of a state at all.
<BR>
<P>Out of interest, what would you leave in? Nothing more than an agreement
<BR>
on what the laws should be? Would you expect them to hold?
<BR>
<P>And how long do you think it would be before people started to *want*
<BR>
public services, centralised police, etc, and if unable to change the
<BR>
top-level government's arrangements, implement things at lower levels?
