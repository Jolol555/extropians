<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Speaking of unions . . .  My views on unions have evolved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;considerably over the last few years as I've become more and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;libertarian in my political philosophy.  I don't see why people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shouldn't be able to band together into collective bargaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arrangements or why a union shouldn't be able to make a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contract with a company that forbids the hiring of non-union
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;employees.  Of course, state sanctioning shouldn't be tolerated,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but I can see unions doing a lot of good in a more libertarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;world, especially in taking over and decentralizing many of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;functions of the state social welfare function. Many of the things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that anarcho-capitalist theorists see as being provided by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;privately-produced law agencies would be more effective if coupled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with social welfare unions that also had some economic functions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such as  collective bargaining.  Individuals would have to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the freedom to enter and leave unions (with some costs imposed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm sure).  I wonder what others think of such ideas?
</EM><BR>
<P>My Union has many of the features you mention, but also has taken
<BR>
some recent political bad moves which I shall also mention.
<BR>
<P>Anyone can leave the union by taking a &quot;withdrawal&quot; on their card.
<BR>
This has to be approved by the board, but is typically a rubber
<BR>
stamp. This is for union people promoted to management jobs. The
<BR>
card can be regained by paying the equivalent of a quarters dues
<BR>
along with the current quarters dues. (a quarter runs about $200
<BR>
currently)
<BR>
<P>We have an independent entity, the &quot;Electrical Insurance trustees&quot;
<BR>
which manages health and welfare and pensions. Contractors are
<BR>
required to pay into these funds, but they are independent of them,
<BR>
union members can switch companies without losing benefits.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Problems with unions are that there is no public oversight, union
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;leadership tends to be secretive (and tends toward corruption and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resorts to violence to get the job done (this is not just a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;characteristic of the Teamsters)), and difficult to push
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alternative leadership candidates over incumbents. I highly oppose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;allowing unions to demand closed shops. This is a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anti-competitive thing, as well as refusing to allow more than one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;union to operate in the same shop. If I'm a worker, I want to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;able to choose not only if I want to belong to a union or not, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to have a choice of unions. Unions also foster workplace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;harassment of independent operators in open shops, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worker grievance procedures they mandate tend to foster frivolous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complaints.
</EM><BR>
<P>Public oversight? Your kidding right? That would defeat the
<BR>
purpose.
<BR>
<P>I agree with you on the secretiveness. My own union recently
<BR>
conducted a vote on a contract extension that included a massive
<BR>
rewrite of the existing contract. None of which was mentioned in
<BR>
the mailout that included a mail in vote for the contract. Despite
<BR>
the fact that no one we know voted in favor of it, it passed 4-1.
<BR>
We consider it invalid, but basically we're F*****. It removes both
<BR>
shop seniority and the ability to move from shop to shop. All
<BR>
hiring will now be done through the hall. We can't be fired without
<BR>
reason, but now we can be &quot;layed Off&quot; for any reason whatsoever.
<BR>
<P>It benefitted the Union, and some members, but at the expense of
<BR>
others.
<BR>
<P>In protest myself and many of the instructors from the apprentice
<BR>
school (the only federally certified communications apprentice
<BR>
school in the country) have resigned from the program.
<BR>
<P>The only reason for an &quot;open shop&quot; is to attempt to get rid of a
<BR>
union altogether.

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The problem I see with unions is that by encouraging collective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bargaining, they discourage merit pay and individual initiative.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The news today is that the actor's union will have a work stoppage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;regarding commercials, due to a dispute over how residuals will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;paid for cable vs over the air broadcasting.  Whichever way it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;comes out, it will be a &quot;one size fits all&quot; scheme.  No one can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;negotiate a special deal which is more appropriate to their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;circumstances.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This seems to add an inherent inflexibility which ends up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;increasing costs.
</EM><BR>
<P>11 Years ago when I took over my current position as Premise
<BR>
engineer here computer viruses were fairly new. I created some
<BR>
aliases and used my telephony training to establish myself on the
<BR>
top hacker boards in the world, with obvious benefits to the
<BR>
company. This was the first building in Ameritech with anti-viral
<BR>
protection.
<BR>
<P>As we began building LANS and such I used to take the books home at
<BR>
night and on weekends and taught myself the trade. I was Novell
<BR>
certified since version 2.15. I've been installing Cisco routers
<BR>
and switches (and programming them) ever since.
<BR>
<P>I'm currently pursuing my CCNA on my own since the company
<BR>
currently does not support this training for union member.
<BR>
<P>My point? Your basically right, I have a skill set well beyond the
<BR>
average, yet the company pays me the same as your basic wire
<BR>
puller. However I do have some specially negotiated deals that
<BR>
apply only to me (and those I say) and am constantly pushing the
<BR>
envelope as to what is Union work.
<BR>
<P><P>But it's actually currently costing the company alot less by having
<BR>
me doing this work. (not for long ;) )
