</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed your just repeating the same motto, but with nicer words.
<BR>
Who annihilated the traditional safety nets? Who has made impossible for the 
<BR>
market to provide income insurances? These things were working out in the 
<BR>
past, but on a low scale (of course, for societies on a lower level of 
<BR>
development). But then the 20th century was the century of the blind faith 
<BR>
in central planning.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; transhumanists, the welfare state doesn't produce self- asserted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; individuals. It produces sycophants, that are horribly afraid of what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people might think (after all that's the normal situation in a welfare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville said this of democratic societies back in 1830, long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;before welfare.  As men become more equal the individual appears more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;insignificant, and the force of public opinion become tyrranical.
</EM><BR>
<P>What perpetuates this system, and makes this conduct profitable in the short 
<BR>
run?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; state, the bureaucrats' opinion matter for all decisions in life. Forget
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not in the US.  Perhaps Sweden has gone past the point of moderation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, the difference between the US and Sweden is just a matter of 
<BR>
degrees, not a difference in fundamenta.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; the system collapses the country goes down the drain. Uruguay was  one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the richest countries once, by adopting a very big welfare state they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that position. So has Sweden.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;_Uruguay_?  Rich?  When?  How?  I do remember Jane Jacobs saying either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Uruguay or Paraguay did well for a while, quite some time ago, with cattle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;farming; decline seems natural, with falling commodity prices and no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;industrial development.  And a few military dictatorships, no doubt.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<P>Still in the 20s Uruguay was sending aid to Sweden, and the fall of the 
<BR>
Urugauyan economy cannot be attributed to economical determinism. Successful 
<BR>
societies are able to adapt, to develop new ways of living and producing. 
<BR>
The welfare state calcifies that, since it doesn't give incentives for 
<BR>
change, rather it premiates staying in the old system. Uruguay was also hit 
<BR>
hard by the complete collapse of world trade in the late 20s, when most 
<BR>
countries engaged in mercantilist tariff barriers. But the ulterior motive 
<BR>
was the welfare state, the juntas came when the economic collapse was 
<BR>
starting to be felt by society at large. Often the gained support by 
<BR>
pledging that nothing would change under their rule
