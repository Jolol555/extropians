<EM>&gt;&gt; Typically, more foolish (or naive) people are ego-stricken and have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; a &quot;need&quot; to go about blabbing how smart and knowledgeable they are,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; while a true wise one is more likely to keep quiet allowing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; observer to ask, bear and learn... really learn... with dignity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your statement is heartwarming, but false.
</EM><BR>
<P>If taken too literally, sure--as any generalization taken too literally
<BR>
would be.  But as generalizations go, it actually has some value.  A
<BR>
recent study showed, for example, that the less competent one is at a
<BR>
task (including purely intellectual ones), the more likely one is to
<BR>
over-estimate one's own competence.  Likewise, the very competent are
<BR>
more likely evaluate themselves as average, and to over-estimate what
<BR>
the average is.
<BR>
<P>It is a handy heuristic sometimes for judging the value of an opinion
<BR>
from someone unknown: how vocally does the speaker spout eir credentials
<BR>
or experience in the field, and impugn those of others?  Those most
<BR>
competent in a field are generally content to give their opinions as if
<BR>
they are &quot;obvious&quot; rather than giving them value because of their source.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The more he spoke of his honor, the faster we counted the spoons...&quot;
