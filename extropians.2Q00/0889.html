</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Can I add something to my original question?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;I think that (real, true) works of art (paintings, sculptures, etc.) last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for ever and ever. Meaningful. Timeless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;That is, in my opinion, a sort of supreme, old, Extropy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The assertion that &quot;real&quot;, art must be an object is wrong. Extropic art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eschews the rigid idea of art as object and explores various forms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creativity, bioengineering, performance, conceptual art, virtual reality, new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; film media, nanotechnology, ideas, etc., as valid mediums. It must.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think though that what the writer is trying to communicate is their
<BR>
own view that the artists of the Renaissance were, in the eyes of their
<BR>
own time, transhuman beings. We can appreciate the breakthroughs they
<BR>
acheived, and the beauty they created with the technologies they had, as
<BR>
indicative of a local exponential growth in artistic expression in that
<BR>
time period. The idealism of classical figures in renaissance art is
<BR>
reflected in the current day in much fantasy and futurist art.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;What is not a work of art has (just) a temporary appeal, beauty,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;interest, meaning. Or is handicraft….
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Twentieth century music and art's most invigorating element was it's very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changeability and cultural liquidity.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, the transience of some art says nothing about its credibility as
<BR>
art per se, but merely is a matter of being limited in its marketability
<BR>
and it audience.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Snobbery in art is a result of illiteracy of the general populace. Images
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; today are omnipresent.
</EM><BR>
<P>yet much art is created with the eye to disenfranchise the eye of the
<BR>
general populace. Abstract artists tend to really excell at trying to
<BR>
disconnect the audience from understanding.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     We are bombarded daily with High and Low Art - and our eyes are VERY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different from they were in the mid fifteenth century. We have been literally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cortex reconfigured to accommodate far more information than ever.
</EM><BR>
<P>And far more varied information as well. This is the great thing about
<BR>
current transhumanism, there are no predifined limits, in fact limits
<BR>
are discouraged. Expansion, extrusion, and xenofusion/fission are the
<BR>
names of the game.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      Going forward, 21st century explorations of slippery new mediums will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increase the mutability of design and problem solving, causing artists to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become more inventive, imaginative and spontaneous than ever. This is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; challenge and the excitement about art these days!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Laws, principles of science are timeless, meaningful, for ever?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  After Popper (and Einstein, etc.) I’m not sure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am once again mystified that once more, on this list of &quot;futurists&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when art is brought up we are still talking about sappy smiling cross dresser
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mona Lisa and her ancient armless cousin the Venus De Milo.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Question:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Why be five centuries behind in one's information about art while thirty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years ahead in one's ideas about science?
</EM><BR>
<P>I can answer this one: because when those of us who are technically
<BR>
astute but not aethetically astute take a look at contemporary art, too
<BR>
often we feel like we are being asked to wear the emperor's new
<BR>
clothes..
<BR>
<P>This is not to say that contemporary art, per se, is crap. It rather
<BR>
recognises that we currently benefit from the filter of previous
<BR>
generations who weeded out the crap of the art world from their own
<BR>
generation, such that we only see now, for the most, the 'Oscar winners'
<BR>
of art, rather than the C grade horror flicks of art in history. Thus it
<BR>
is easier to appreciate the art of prior generations, because it has
<BR>
been filtered, so the consumer gains greater utility from each exposure
<BR>
to art of prior generations than having to wade through the the slough
<BR>
of current art.
<BR>
<P>As they say in the movies,&quot;I'll see it when it comes out on video.&quot;
<BR>
<P>beyond this, I think that the sort of transcendental art that most
<BR>
futurists appreciate the most is that which looks to the future with a
<BR>
positive utopian view, rather than with the distopian perspective of
<BR>
most artists of this past century, their focus on the gutter, the
<BR>
anti-hero, etc. The only real utopian art of this past century belonged
<BR>
to the propaganda machines of the various socialist/nazi/communist
<BR>
governments, something that many of us look on with distain, properly...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So art is timeless (lasts for ever) because is qualitative, but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  merely subjective.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Science laws are quantitative, objective, but not final.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  And – interesting enough -  in art and in science we can often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  identify exactly the same philosophical “input”.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is true that exceptional art and music does bridge cultural and time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; barriers, and carries the user into a new consciousness which can prepare the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind for the future and for the upheavals that the new technologies and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientific discoveries will bring upon our cultures.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However this does not imply timelessness, but timeliness, in other word, good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; art is of our time and for our time, yet perhaps a bit *ahead* of it's time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Also that it speaks to the heart or root of the human condition and
<BR>
human desires, no matter what the age.
