<P>
<EM>&gt; out of curiosity, and i do apologize for the brevity of this message, does 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extropianism allow for the human mind to evolve beyond logic/rationalism?
</EM><BR>
<P>My experience is that most people who say things like that aren't
<BR>
interested in something &quot;better&quot; than rationalism--they're interested
<BR>
in resurrecting some old dead theology that's been a proven failure
<BR>
for centuries and dressing it in new clothes.
<BR>
<P>Certainly the existing specific methods of logic and science, and the
<BR>
specific results of them can be improved upon; but that in itself is
<BR>
rational--a rational being is simply one that seeks truth.  Reality
<BR>
exists regardless of our actions or desires.  A rational being is one
<BR>
whose actions are most compatible with its present understanding of
<BR>
that reality.  That understanding can grow and change; but reality is
<BR>
still there, and commitment to it, rather than to any action clearly
<BR>
in conflict with it, will always be &quot;rational&quot;, and will always be
<BR>
superior to any alternative.
<BR>
