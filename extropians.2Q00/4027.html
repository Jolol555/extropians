<EM>&gt; &gt;  The feeling is there.  At a minimum, the altruism is there (in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  normal sense of the term, not Ayn Rand's contrived version).  How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  could you tell the difference between these characters and characters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  who loved each other fully?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sigh.... If that's love, baby...  I can tell you, I'd hate to be with any
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; those cold fish....
</EM><BR>
<P>I think Rand had some interesting insights on relationships, but her
<BR>
philosophical stance got the better of her.  In this area, her theory
<BR>
triumphed over reality in many ways.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Besides finding that kind of &quot;love&quot; a truly boring relationship, I dont
</EM><BR>
want
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to get into what I think of her hero worshop requirements surrounding men.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rand, Brandon,
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, Branden -- derived from &quot;Ben Rand&quot; = &quot;son of Rand.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Barbara, her husband... really creepy stuff... plus her ideas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about sex. It's all to dreadful and terrible and adolescent and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frightening...
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't say &quot;creepy,&quot; just weird -- as if that's much of change.:)  The
<BR>
funny thing is more how the affair was carried on openly.
<BR>
<P>As for her views on sexuality in general, I find them more a projection of
<BR>
her peculiar personality than as firmly grounded in Objectivism.  She seem
<BR>
to reduce all sex to a power struggle -- like Camille Paglia.  That said, if
<BR>
her ideas on sexuality don't dovetail with the rest of her ideas, the
<BR>
question to ask is what would better fit the latter.  I actually think
<BR>
Nathaniel Branden's books on romantic love -- _The Psychology of Romantic
<BR>
Love_ and _The Romantic Love Question and Answer Book_; yet they didn't work
<BR>
for me as pickup books!:) -- might better fit the bill here, though I by no
<BR>
means think he's got the market cornered here, and there's lots of work to
<BR>
be done.  (This is assuming that his work has some validity.  I believe it
<BR>
does.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At this time I'd like to politely excuse myself... I think there's someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; across the room who wants to talk about cumina, pelagia and
</EM><BR>
nudibranches...
<BR>
<P>Understood.:)
