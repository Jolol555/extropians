<EM>&gt; That has been my argument. If Mr. Zero wants to spew his identity all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over the public arena, let him. If he doesn't, which is apparently how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he feels about his personal identity, then he has absolutely no right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argue that I should meet a standard that he has no intention of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conforming to, and by his admitted example of his instructions to his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kids, has no intention of encouraging any other member of his family to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As it stands, I already meet his standard far better than he does.

<P>Mike, please.  Who are you to decide if Zero has a &quot;right&quot; to argue anything
<BR>
he wants?
<BR>
<P>Also, Zero has never advocated anybody reveal their address over the
<BR>
internet.  I spuriously suggested that he should give me all of his personal
<BR>
details.  His response was a retort that I should go first.  He never
<BR>
seriously asked anybody to do this, and never promised that he would do so
<BR>
if anybody/everybody else did also.
<BR>
<P>You are attacking Zero based on his answers to my question.  This makes me
<BR>
feel partially responsible for your attack against him.  I would like you to
<BR>
stop attacking Zero, and realize that he never promised or advocated giving
<BR>
out personal information on the Internet.  That was a comment intended for
<BR>
me, and it doesn't mean what you think it does.
