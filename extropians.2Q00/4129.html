<EM>&gt; &gt;So far I have taken the stance that our attitudes do not matter much.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Surveillance is coming anyway.  I still think that.  spike

<EM>&gt; Zero Powers wrote:  Same here.  I just take it a step further and say that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it will be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good thing.  There is no benefit without some detriment, and that certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; holds true for transparency.  But on the whole I am convinced that society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as a whole will benefit greatly from transparency, so long as its power is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distributed and not kept in the control of the relative few.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja.  I look at many of the dire predictions that came true: the population
<BR>
estimates of some cities came out about right.  But when we got there,
<BR>
it wasnt as bad as we thought.  How about the 1970s prediction that
<BR>
in the year y2k, people would *buy* drinking water!  Horrors.
<BR>
But when it actually happened that way (sort of), well, it just wasnt
<BR>
that bad.  The Jeremiahs forgot to predict that nearly everyone would
<BR>
have plenty of spare money for that sorta thing.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, let me extrapolate with the dire predictions I myself have made
<BR>
regarding the loss of privacy in our own bedrooms, assuming we havent
<BR>
the means to defeat such devices.  I suggest that this situation too, will
<BR>
not be as bad as we think it will be, for a couple of reasons.  The ones
<BR>
most affected will be those who are young and beautiful and worth
<BR>
gawking at.  This generation will be preadapted by having grown up
<BR>
with surveillance cameras, from preschool on up.  Perhaps they wont
<BR>
mind as much as we will, and lets face it, we will be oldies then, and
<BR>
who wants to watch oldies?
<BR>
<P>This whole privacy-in-the-bedroom obsession must be a recent thing.
<BR>
I dont think people had such luxury until a few hundred years ago, and
<BR>
yet they managed to get by somehow.  Perhaps most people
<BR>
will be able to afford some form of antisurveillance, and those who
<BR>
cannot will manage anyway, perhaps by being far less modest about
<BR>
their bodies that we prudish moderns tend to be.  spike
