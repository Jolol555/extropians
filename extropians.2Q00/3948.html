<EM>&gt; At the first CyberArts conference in L.A. in 1990 - the BEST digital arts 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conference ever held! - a man who created the systems used by the big record 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; houses to clean up recordings demonstrated a live system into which he read 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a poem.  He then stated that this system could take his input and output it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as ANY sound, retaining legibiilty.  Then he demonstrated it, having the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system speak back his vocalization, using the sound of waves crashing on a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beach.  It was waves crashing on a beach, reading poetry, retaining perfect 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legibility and retaining his style.  Clearly, such a system could take my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather lousy singing voice and map it to Caruso.  So, where can I buy it?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>There are a few different types of algorithms which can do this type of
<BR>
effect, with varying degrees of precision and differing qualities to the
<BR>
sound.  Some of the simplest ones, such as vocoding, take very little DSP
<BR>
power even when a high number of bands are used.  Vocoding, by its nature,
<BR>
has a &quot;filtered&quot; and often identifiable sound to it, but preserves a
<BR>
lot of the character of the source when a large number of bands (say 30)
<BR>
are used and is done with good (read expensive) filters.
<BR>
<P>What is being described above at the Cyberarts conference is probably an
<BR>
audio convolving algorithm.  These types of matrix algorithms are pretty
<BR>
expensive DSP-wise to do in real-time on Red Book audio (16-bits @ 44.1kHz)
<BR>
but can produce very clean results that do not have the processing
<BR>
artifacts in the output signal unlike the computationally cheaper classes
<BR>
of algorithms.  In 1990 it would have required a high-end DSP
<BR>
engine to do in real-time.  It *is* interesting that the choice for the
<BR>
second signal was waves crashing on a beach -- a classic &quot;pink noise&quot;
<BR>
source.  Most cheap algorithms do not preserve articulation as well with
<BR>
noisy carriers (in this case almost pure noise), which lends support to a
<BR>
convolving algorithm.
<BR>
<P>For a rough idea of the computational requirements for convolving
<BR>
algorithms, I have a middle-aged audio sampler from E-mu Systems that
<BR>
included a convolver utility as part of the operating system (EOS v2.5 at
<BR>
the time).  Although the processor is admittedly pretty weak (I believe it
<BR>
is a Motorola 68k at around 25MHz), it takes the system around 10 minutes
<BR>
of processing time per second of Red Book audio to convolve two samples.
<BR>
Of course, a proper DSP would do these types of ops much faster at the
<BR>
same clock speed.
<BR>
<P>Subjectively, convolvers are wicked cool audio processing utilities and
<BR>
I've gotten great results with them on occasion when looking for
<BR>
interesting sounds/textures.  I actually have more use for convolvers than
<BR>
the ever popular vocoders.
