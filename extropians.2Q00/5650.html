<EM>&gt; I'm surprized at you, Michael.  Open borders are a bedrock of the free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market economy, and a simple consequence of granting the same basic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rights of free travel and association to those born on one side of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imaginary line as we do to those born on the other.  Nationalism is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unbecoming rational minds.  &quot;Excessive people&quot; are a resource to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cherished, not a burden.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't look at it as a nationalist issue, its an economic AND ecological issue.
<BR>
Open borders for TRADE are a bedrock of a free market economy. The existing
<BR>
members of a free market economy should also have the ability to control the
<BR>
quality of life in their communities. If people living elsewhere want a high
<BR>
quality of life like we do, then they should work to recreate our success where
<BR>
they are at. Part of that is re-engineering their society. Societies that
<BR>
produce more people than can be sustained on their resources not only degrade
<BR>
their own quality of life, by exporting the results of their bad social
<BR>
reproduction policies to our countries, they not only perpetuate a dumb idea
<BR>
where they are at, but they export people who will perpetuate those same dumb
<BR>
ideas elsewhere.
<BR>
<P>I see this all the time, with flatlanders moving up here to the sticks. THey
<BR>
want the high quality of life that we have living up here, but once they get
<BR>
here they go about trying to change our community and its laws into the same
<BR>
sort of shithole they came from, then they wonder why everything has gone to
<BR>
shit. When my parents moved up here from Massachusetts when I was a kid, they
<BR>
understood this, and we learned to live like the people around here lived.
<BR>
<P>Vermont has the lowest homicide rates in the country, and the most liberal gun
<BR>
laws, but some moronic woman had the gall to actually complain in a letter to
<BR>
the editor about her horror at learning how easy it is for a law abiding person
<BR>
to carry a gun, completely oblivious to the fact that its obviously not a
<BR>
problem. (There were, as I recall, about 15 criminal homicides in 1999 in
<BR>
Vermont, which has a population of about 450,000.)
<BR>
<P>Orwell observed this same problem in England in the late 30's. The British are
<BR>
famous for their civility and politeness waiting for busses, trains, and
<BR>
trolleys. When eastern european refugees started coming to Britain in 1939, at
<BR>
first there were few enough that the eastern habits of pushing and shoving for
<BR>
the door got drilled out of newcomers by the larger number of native passengers.
<BR>
However, once the refugee population turned into a flood, the 'quality of life'
<BR>
of waiting politely in line to get on a bus or train degraded down to that of
<BR>
the newcomers.
<BR>
<P>Opening your borders with any economy that does not behave as yours does only
<BR>
opens your own economy up to being degraded by its association. Take our
<BR>
relationship with China, for example. We as a nation are benefitting from the
<BR>
slave labor practices of the People's Republic of China. Their cheap products
<BR>
are keeping our inflation low. But our morals and ethics have been degraded, we
<BR>
are externalizing the cost of the products we want onto the backs of the chinese
<BR>
laborer who is not paid, or is paid little for his forced labor. I personally
<BR>
try to boycott any chinese made product. If I know a product was made in China,
<BR>
I won't buy it. I would guess though that probably half of the stuff in my
<BR>
apartment was made in china, or parts or resources for the stuff was made in
<BR>
china.
<BR>
<P>We are now no better than those in the the Pre-civil war US who did not own
<BR>
slaves, did not allow slavery in our own states or communities, but still
<BR>
benefitted economically from slavery. Should we then institute an 'underground
<BR>
railroad' of immigration? In the current case, people are not physically
<BR>
enslaved, they are enslaved by economic and social memes that create and
<BR>
perpetuate poor living conditions where they are at. Memetic shackles do not
<BR>
come off when you cross the border, they stay with you. Slavery did not end with
<BR>
the underground railroad, you might notice. Only the civil war and the 14th
<BR>
amendment did so.
<BR>
<P>If we opened immigration to everyone that wanted to live here, we'd shortly have
<BR>
6 billion people living in the US, starving to death.
