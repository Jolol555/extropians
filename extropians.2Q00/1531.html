<EM>&gt; &gt; Zero Powers:  Curious, what was it that freed you from your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; belief?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I took my college girlfriend to a physics seminar featuring Carl Sagan's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Cosmos, because she thought Sagan was the most gorgeous man on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;two feet.  That changed both our lives: she soon threw me back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for another guy who looked more like Sagan, and I was led to study
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Steven Jay Gould, which led to Douglas Hofstadter's Escher Godel Bach,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which led me to realize that my religion and all religions I know of are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self referential systems, unverifiable.  Changed my major from theology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to engineering.  Atheists make poor ministers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Funny.  I came to it from quite the opposite path.  I was looking for 
<BR>
&quot;rational&quot; evidence to support my belief when what I found had the opposite 
<BR>
effect.  I started reading stuff by the Jesus Seminar, notably _Honest to 
<BR>
Jesus_, which was an attempt to ferret out what might be left of the 
<BR>
&quot;historical&quot; Jesus buried under 2000 years of ecclesiastical, political, and 
<BR>
sociological mythological build up.  The Jesus I discovered there had little 
<BR>
resemblance to the guy I was hearing about in church every Sunday.

<BR>
<P>That started me on the slippery slope to stuff like _The Varieties of 
<BR>
Religious Experience_ by William James, then to more scientific stuff.  
<BR>
Before long I found that what was left of my &quot;religion&quot; had completely 
<BR>
evaporated, all except for my love for my fellow man and awe at creation.
