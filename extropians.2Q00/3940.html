Oh, OK.  What you're saying is quite different from what Mike Lorrey wrote,
<BR>
and I see now that you were actually the person who posted the original
<BR>
message I asked about.  And from your explanation I can understand why you
<BR>
would say there may be no escape.
<BR>
<P>Although I'm familiar with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics, I've
<BR>
never actually read the math involved. Regarding the calculus, I've always
<BR>
thought it was pretty remarkable that a fiction  built from a definition of
<BR>
real numbers and a few operations and rules, could end up being so very
<BR>
useful in &quot;real life.&quot;  My 16 year old daughter is studying calculus in
<BR>
school and was having a hard time understanding some of her assignments, so
<BR>
I got out some old real analysis books I had lying around and taught her
<BR>
calculus from scratch, and she too thought it an amazing thing.
<BR>
<P>Of course I'm not qualified to pass judgement on quantum mechanics, not
<BR>
having read the math.  But this much I feel safe to say:  quantum mechanics,
<BR>
like calculus, is a model which is useful in studying and manipulating our
<BR>
environment.  I would predict that, like calculus, it won't be the final
<BR>
model.
<BR>
<P>The semi-solipsistic problem I alluded to has more to do with psychology
<BR>
than with quantum mechanics, but the two may be more closely related than
<BR>
one might think. I believe they are, but I would like to organize my
<BR>
thoughts and data before writing more on the subject.

Subject: RE: The Matrix
<BR>
<P><P>Well, you must watch the movie (if not for this line
<BR>
of thought, then, just because it's a great movie).
<BR>
What I mean by simulational here is something
<BR>
altogether different from the semi-solipsism problem
<BR>
you're referring to below.  By simulational, it is
<BR>
meant that reality is inherently defined by discrete
<BR>
mathematics - at the most fundamental level reality is
<BR>
&quot;grainy.&quot;  This is because the ultimate basis of
<BR>
matter/energy is quantum mechanical.  What
<BR>
ramifications does this have?  Besides the interesting
<BR>
fact that calculus (long held to be the true
<BR>
mathematics which could so accurately describe motion
<BR>
and changes of rate) turns out to be nothing more than
<BR>
a helpful fiction with no basis in reality (i.e. it
<BR>
was useful because it treated remarkably small
<BR>
discrete changes in position and velocity as
<BR>
continuous - something which, though innaccurate was
<BR>
far more useful than previous mathematical models), it
<BR>
can be shown that there is absolutely no experiment
<BR>
which you could perform in such a universe which would
<BR>
differentiate it in any recognizable way from a
<BR>
quantum mechanical simulaiton running on some alien
<BR>
meta-computer.
<BR>
Does this prove we're living in a computer?  No.  By
<BR>
definition, that cannot be proved either.  Therin lies
<BR>
the far more devious realization - we MIGHT AS WELL be
<BR>
in a simulation.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Indeed it is.  I've been waiting for someone to say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that  :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It really puts a cinderella spin on reality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though...sure, they have to battle soulless machines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bent on keeping them as their personal &quot;batteries.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nonetheless, the underlying metaphysical statement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that all of reality is simulational is completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a far more powerful (and, diabolical) way.  Our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simulation may be inescapable and there are no big

<EM>&gt; bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robots to direct our anger and frustration at...
