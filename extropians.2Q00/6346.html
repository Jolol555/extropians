<EM>&gt; damage to the brain do you think might be caused by the

<EM>&gt; failure of the aging body supporting the brain rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the aging of the brain itself?  In other words, if we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only replace the body, and lack a way to treat the brain,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how far will this get us?

<P>Well, [1] below, estimates that:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;approximately 10% of all neocortical neurons are lost over the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life span in both sexes&quot;
<BR>
so, I suppose if you assume this is due to the body not supplying
<BR>
it with what it needs (glucose, O2, amino-acids, lipids, etc.)
<BR>
then you could make the argument that this is failure of the body
<BR>
to support the brain.  But I think aging is highly organ specific
<BR>
because nature &quot;primarily&quot; evolves individual programs within each
<BR>
organ.  So IMO, I would guess that much more of this is actual
<BR>
aging of the brain.  Now, strokes and lack of blood supply are due to 
<BR>
failures of the endothelial/immune systems and not the brain per se.
<BR>
Since some people (~20%?) do die from things going wrong inside your
<BR>
your brain, there is a fraction whom a cloned body probably isn't
<BR>
going to help much (it might even hurt them if the aged endothelial
<BR>
system cannot tolerate a stronger heart.
<BR>
<P>Sapolsky would argue that at least some of the cell loss in the
<BR>
brain is not due to 'aging' (brain or body) per se, but results
<BR>
from environmental[adrenaline] stress.  So it is really the
<BR>
the accumulation of environmental experiences ('scars of life').
<BR>
<P>The 10% loss above, would argue that you should be able to get out
<BR>
to several hundred years, if you can live with a smaller brain
<BR>
and *if* loss doesn't accelerate (!?!).  There are clearly a large
<BR>
number of individuals whose body wears out long before their brain
<BR>
and for them a clone body would certainly be nice. It isn't a universal
<BR>
panacea though.
