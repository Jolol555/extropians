<EM>&gt; &gt; But only in that most courts today seem to have total ignorance or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  distain for the 9th Amendment, and are drifting away from the founders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  concepts of Natural Law. Under the 9th, any rights not enumerated in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Constitution are retained by the people, as individuals, so it follows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  that since privacy is not explicitly mentioned, it is a 9th Amendment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't read the IXth ammendment this way.  The text says:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           shall not be construed to deny or disparage others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           retained by the people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm no constitutional law scholar, but this just seems to say &quot;The fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a subject is addressed in the Constitution doesn't mean that it excludes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other rights the people may have,&quot; or alternatively, &quot;the Constitution is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an exhaustive enumeration of rights.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>The way I read it is that any rights addressed by name in the Constitution do not
<BR>
exceed or override any rights the people may posess which are not named in the
<BR>
Constitution. The 9th amendment deals with rights, while the Xth deals with
<BR>
POWERS, not rights.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Are you thinking of the Xth ammendment?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              The powers not delegated to the United States
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;              are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which I have always taken to simply mean that the Founders intended that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; federal government be a LIMITED government, with only explicitly enumerated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; powers.  (The Xth ammendment has always seemed a little foggy in it's last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clause -- probably intentionally so -- as to the division of power between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people and states . . .)
</EM><BR>
<P>Because it deals with powers, not rights, it deals with basically stating that
<BR>
governmental powers outside of those dealt with in the constitution, are to be
<BR>
hashed out by the citizens of the respective states as to whether those
<BR>
governmental powers are to be managed at the state or local level, as they choose
<BR>
to define it in their state constitutions and laws.
