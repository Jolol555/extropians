Life Reflections by George Carlin
<BR>
<P>1. Never raise your hands to your kids. It leaves your groin
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unprotected.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
2. I'm not into working out. My philosophy is no pain, no pain.
<BR>
<P>3. I'm in shape. Round is a shape.
<BR>
<P>4. I'm desperately trying to figure out why Kamikaze pilots wore
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;helmets.
<BR>
<P>5. Do illiterate people get the full effect of alphabet soup?
<BR>
<P>6. I've always wanted to be somebody, but I should have been more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specific.
<BR>
<P>7. Ever notice when you blow in a dog's face he gets mad at you,  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when you take him in a car he sticks his head out the      
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window?
<BR>
<P>8. Ever notice that anyone going slower than you is an idiot, but 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anyone going faster is a maniac?
<BR>
<P>9. You have to stay in shape. My mother started walking five miles 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a day  when she was 60. She's 97 now and we have no idea where 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she is.
<BR>
<P>10. I have six locks on my door, all in a row. When I go out, I   
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lock every other one. I figure no matter how long somebody    
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stands there picking the locks, they are always locking three 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of them.
<BR>
<P>11. One out of every three Americans is suffering from some form of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mental illness. Think of two of your best friends. If they are 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, then it must be you.
<BR>
<P>12. They show you how detergents take out bloodstains. I think if 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you've got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe your 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laundry isn't your biggest problem.
<BR>
<P>13. Ask people why they have deer heads on their walls and they   
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell you it's because they're such beautiful animals. I think 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my wife is beautiful, but I only have photographs of her on   
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wall.
<BR>
<P>14. A lady came up to me on the street, pointed at my suede jacket 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said, &quot;Don't you know a cow was murdered for that jacket?&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said &quot;I didn't know there were any witnesses. Now I'll have 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to kill you too&quot;.
<BR>
