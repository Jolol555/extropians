<P><EM>&gt; Okay, just to settle this matter (because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bothers me that I didn't personally correct any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; misconceptions personally) here is what I wrote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to Brian last August. (I've taken out Brian's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paragraph since it was private mail.) It seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I was going away and suggested that Brian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forward my clarification, but he did not.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. I thought it wouldn't be appropriate, since it was your
<BR>
mistake, and would look, if not be, rather petty (especially
<BR>
given what a tiny matter it was), so I wrote back, in response
<BR>
to your quoted email here (deleted) saying that you should be
<BR>
the one to correct it, since it was your (small) mistake. I
<BR>
figured it would be a simple and less confusing way to proceed
<BR>
if you, yourself simply forwarded your message to the list.
<BR>
<P>When you didn't do it, I was puzzled, but just figured you were
<BR>
incredibly busy, and would get to it within a few days.
<BR>
<P>More than a few days went by, you hadn't gotten to it, and then,
<BR>
around the same time, the nut started emailing me. At that
<BR>
point, I thought it would be good to remind you, since it would
<BR>
help you as well as me to corrct the matter. At least one other
<BR>
person on Transhuman had made allegations of Extropian Institute
<BR>
plagiarism (I don't recall that he mentioned you by name), and
<BR>
it seemed easy enough to show good conduct with respect to one
<BR>
of the matters at hand, so might as well do it.
<BR>
<P>But then you still didn't forward the email (or write another).
<BR>
At THAT point, to be honest with you, I found it difficult to
<BR>
maintain my previous view of you. Not that anything had changed
<BR>
dramatically, but there was now a small question mark where none
<BR>
had previously existed. A VERY small question mark, but still, a
<BR>
question mark. Consider: I'm getting a barrage of emails from
<BR>
this person who hates you (as I informed you), and you're
<BR>
&quot;refusing&quot; (so it began to seem) to do one simple thing that
<BR>
would go a long way towards settling my thoughts/feelings on
<BR>
this, and maybe even the nutcase's (though not likely), so what
<BR>
is going on?
<BR>
<P>Ultimately, an extremely small matter, of course. But I think it
<BR>
left a slightly bad taste in my mouth. I'm really not sure. Its
<BR>
being an extremely small matter can mean one of two very
<BR>
different things, either: 1) who cares? or 2) why didn't you
<BR>
correct it (given how small/simple it was to correct)? I tend
<BR>
towards the former conclusion (though your response to my recent
<BR>
posts make me wonder if I was gulagified far earlier than I have
<BR>
imagined -- but we may have a chicken and egg problem here!).
<BR>
<P>It's been a while since I've thought about it. I've been
<BR>
plagiarized in the past several times (involving more than a
<BR>
stupid word -- no offense to you, I mean me!), so perhaps I'm
<BR>
unduly sensitive to these things. Also, I've accidentally
<BR>
(twice, in fact) used someone else's ideas (in one case my
<BR>
advisor's -- oops!) without attribution, and felt very strongly
<BR>
that what one does in these situations is immediately make
<BR>
certain attribution is given. That's Job 1.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From other post:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; failing to take action to publicly correct this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; misconception has contributed to the current heat,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am sorry.
</EM><BR>
<P>I certainly hope not, but as someone who believes in the
<BR>
unconscious, I suppose I can't be certain (but I COULD be
<BR>
certain, after a while: ergo, I didn't just make an
<BR>
unfalsifiable claim :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Certainly I  did not do it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deliberately. (Even if I were the source of all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evil, it  would be a stupid way to go about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing something wrong!)
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed, of course my conspiracy theorist correspondent had a
<BR>
theory here: your post-book empire required possession of the
<BR>
term....
<BR>
<P>(Well, then, I better get my book out FIRST :) -- &quot;From Human to
<BR>
Ultrahuman And Beyond: [not sure yet about subtitle].&quot;
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
Brian.
