Gee, does that mean I get my own entry in your database?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:

<EM>&gt; &gt; In dealing with a finite resource?

<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You gotta be joking.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are making the infounded assumpution that it is a finite or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practically finite resources. This is an incorrect assumption.
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh-huh. You've just _asserted_ that it's an incorrect assumption. We're
<BR>
sitting on a planet that masses about 10^27 kilograms. I'd say that puts
<BR>
a fairly clear cap on any particular resource that's embedded in our
<BR>
planetary crust!
<BR>
<P>Facetiousness aside, your point about the methane hydrates, Atlantic 
<BR>
fields, and so on, is taken. However, there are two problems with taking
<BR>
it at face value:
<BR>
<P>Firstly, petrochemicals _can_ be extracted from these deposits, albeit at
<BR>
a cost greater than today's oil price. However, the price of oil is dictated
<BR>
to some extent by demand, which in turn depends on how useful the stuff is
<BR>
to us. If it costs $1000 in today's terms to extract a barrel of oil, then
<BR>
I very much doubt that anybody would consider burning it for energy. Other
<BR>
energy sources will be around, and cheaper, at that price. As a bottom
<BR>
line, it doesn't make sense to extract petroleum for fuel when the
<BR>
energy cost of extracting it exceeds the energy it contains (plus any
<BR>
other intangibles, like the fact that it's readily transportable).
<BR>
<P>Secondly, if you keep on burning this stuff we ultimately run up against
<BR>
a different limit: oxygen. Believe it or not, it's possible to admit that
<BR>
we _do_ inhabit a planet where the oxygen mostly gets generated by C3 and
<BR>
C4 photosynthesis cycle organisms, which in turn get their ATP by devious
<BR>
means from sunlight. This may strike you as a reductio ad absurdam, but
<BR>
even if our planet's mantle is swimming in dissolved hydrocarbons, there's
<BR>
a limit to our ability to oxidize them without fucking over our breathing
<BR>
mixture.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; There won't be a shortage, this is bull. The market will finally meet the demand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; at a market determined price, not a producer determined price. If the british
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; oil unions go out of work, well, I won't cry for them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There ain't no such animals; just high-tech companies that specialise in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; extracting oil from under half a mile of frigid and turbulent ocean.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good, so answer my other point.
</EM><BR>
<P>What other point -- that we should all bow down before the holy market,
<BR>
because the invisible hand knows best?
<BR>
<P>Markets are a _tool_, Mike. We use them because they work, and they're
<BR>
remarkably flexible and general -- but like all tools, they have their
<BR>
limits. I don't buy your religious belief that because you understand
<BR>
how a hammer works, it follows that all problems are nails. From the
<BR>
outside, you'd be surprised how similar market fundamentalists look to
<BR>
Christian fundamentalists, or _any_ other followers of irrational 
<BR>
orthodoxy. Whether the followers reflect the veracity of their belief
<BR>
system accurately is, of course, another matter: but it's not a promising
<BR>
start.
