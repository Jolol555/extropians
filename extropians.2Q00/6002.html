<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Goodness, Natasha, it was a joke, quite obviously so, going by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the reactions of others. The point was: under the assumption
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;that these emails have no basis in fact, there has to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;something highly irrational going on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;[....]
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Why on Earth would I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the particular person you happened to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; involved with pre-Max?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; I wouldn't expect you to know;  that is why your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; asumption was so strange and irrelevant.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Not an assumption -- that was corrected earlier, yes?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No, it was not corrected.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes it was. You obviously didn't check with Max about the
<BR>
reference problem, or look it up in dictionary of philosophy.
<BR>
(It was corrected previously, too.) I don't have time to do
<BR>
homework for hostile interlocutors.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Your trying to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me as a side kick was mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spirited. I don't take jabs like this lightly.
</EM><BR>
<P>A &quot;side kick&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Before pulling out the barf bag, check alternate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; assumptions -- may I suggest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; And what might that be?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Already mentioned one (a jesting attempt to show just how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;extreme one would have to reach to make sense of this guy's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;motivations); Max can probably explain the other more easily:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Ask him about the old &quot;Hesperus&quot; and &quot;Phosphorus&quot; question --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you suffered a reference trauma (for which I think I'm slightly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;responsible, but not mostly).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Your so called jest was not stated in a fun way, Brain.
</EM><BR>
<P>?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't know who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this guy or gal was.  But making a remark
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it was a past romance of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mine was quite rude.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's NOT what I did.
<BR>
<P>If you're not simply trying to score debating points (badly, I
<BR>
might add), I can only conclude that English -- or, certainly,
<BR>
American English -- is not your native language (your odd
<BR>
assumption that &quot;boyfriend&quot; has to refer to a lover who is boy
<BR>
is the more obvious ex.). If so, please slow down before
<BR>
responding.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The above paragraph is another of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; snide remarks.
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I'm not absolutely certain it is, though I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; feel fairly confident it is. The same tactic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; was used in both cases: an attempt to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; me on his side by constant reference to Max's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; having &quot;stolen&quot; my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &quot;ultrahumanism&quot; term
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I now don't think it was your term at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who cares?! That wasn't the issue AT ALL. I can't believe the
<BR>
lack of subtlety of your thought here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Towards the Good,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't believe this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then you a petty, blindly tribal, small-minded human being --
<BR>
or, at a minimum, are acting like one.
<BR>
<P>Towards the Good (with not everyone on board, unfortunately),
<BR>
Brian.
