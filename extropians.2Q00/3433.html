<EM>&gt; That's a great question about economic rationality.  Suppose you're faced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the decision of whether to go through a transporter.  For whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason, you've gone through similar transporters 10 times, and each time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successfully experienced coming out the other end.  Should this increase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your confidence in going into the transporter this time?  I believe Nozick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; posed a similar problem.  I'll try to dig it up.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the philosophical perspective, I don't think it does.  After all,
</EM><BR>
we are already assuming that transporters have the property that the guy
<BR>
coming out will remember going in.  So there is no surprise in the idea
<BR>
that someone would remember doing it ten times.  We can already predict
<BR>
that this is exactly what will happen in this circumstance.
<BR>
<P>Those who define their identity not to be transferred by copying agree
<BR>
about the facts, but they differ in the interpretation.  They say
<BR>
that each person who goes into the transporter dies, and a new person
<BR>
comes out.  It's just a matter of definitions.
<BR>
<P>Now, if you want to look at things economically rather than
<BR>
philosophically, it may well be that people who refuse to use transporters
<BR>
(or other forms of copying) are at an economic disadvantage to the
<BR>
people (or series of people, in one view) who use them.  I imagine that
<BR>
in practice, people will come to use these technologies eventually.
<BR>
All these philosophical quibblings will be viewed with the same amusement
<BR>
that we feel today towards the medieval theologians who squabbled over
<BR>
how many angels could dance on the head of a pin.
