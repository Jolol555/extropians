<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 28'th update on my fly longevity experiments. In run #24
<BR>
&nbsp;I further looked at ways and means of reducing alcohol induced mortality.
<BR>
&nbsp;Unfortunately A 20% alcohol solution (50% vodka) is much more toxic than
<BR>
&nbsp;than the 12.5% wine I had used earlier. Most flies died during the first
<BR>
&nbsp;day of alcohol exposure. The surviving flies had been exposed to various
<BR>
&nbsp;supplements for such a short period of time that these may have not had
<BR>
&nbsp;enough time to built any protection against alcohol toxicity. However
<BR>
&nbsp;adding some rooibos tea to the grape extract Leucoselect, appeared to
<BR>
&nbsp;delay early death somewhat. Pycogenol looked somewhat interesting too.
<BR>
&nbsp;This results might be all due to chance.
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In run #25 I further looked at the individual effect of pycnogenol,
<BR>
&nbsp;and rooibos tea on survival of alcohol free flies. Artichoke was included
<BR>
&nbsp;as a positive control. Here I was surprised by the excellent short term
<BR>
&nbsp;survival of pycnogenol doped flies. This advantage proved to be
<BR>
&nbsp;transient. Several interpretations are possible to account for this
<BR>
&nbsp;temporary benefit. Proanthocyanidins are known to be unstable in
<BR>
&nbsp;solution, and it is possible that pynogenol proanthocyanidins became
<BR>
&nbsp;oxidized after about 2 weeks, so that their protective antioxident effect
<BR>
&nbsp;was lost after this time. Another possible explanation is that flies
<BR>
&nbsp;might reduce their own antioxidant defences, with continued exposure to
<BR>
&nbsp;pycnogenol. I intend to test these hypotheses in future.
