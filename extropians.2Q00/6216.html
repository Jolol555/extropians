<P><EM> &gt; Like the aircraft carrier, the death of the tank has been prophesied for 
</EM><BR>
some
<BR>
<EM> &gt; time.  I do think the big lumbering giant M-1 is the last in that line; a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; real dinosaur.  I see the armored vehicle of 2025 as very light, very fast
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and very smart.  And maybe on legs instead of tracks.
</EM><BR>
<P>You do the M-1 an injustice by calling it 'lumbering':  it is *fast*, the
<BR>
fastest thing on tracks.  Its acceleration kicks ass as well.  It is smart
<BR>
as hell, too, with the new electronic upgrades.  Even without them, back
<BR>
in '85 it was standard on the range to travel over medium rough terrain at
<BR>
+30 mph and identify, engage, and hit *3* pop-up targets in 15 seconds.
<BR>
<P>The only major disadvantage to its size is that it takes an entire C5-A to
<BR>
air transport one. Well, and if you wanted to deploy them in a city, but
<BR>
that was always a stupid thing to do with a tank.
<BR>
<P>You are right, though, that the future is probably smaller.  I think they
<BR>
are starting to have enough confidence in autoloading guns to do away with
<BR>
the loader (bringing it down to a 3 man crew), which will make it much
<BR>
easier eliminate the manned turret (a major weight problem).  Also, with
<BR>
modern computers and heads-up type displays, perhaps a dedicated gunner is
<BR>
no longer needed.  So you can have something with the speed, armor, and
<BR>
firepower of an M-1, with an autoloading main gun on a small swivel
<BR>
turret, 2 man crew, and about 1/3 the weight.
