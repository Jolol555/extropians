<EM>&gt; &gt; Assuming that you can build hardware that somehow does discriminate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pitch as fast as we do, you have the latency issue that you are now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ready to start playing the note that the human audience has already
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; heard from the source (whistle, guitar-string or whatever) and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; start late.  You just can't make this work in real time performance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; situations, even if you can hide the original control signal from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; audience.  The control signal matched the timing of the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; performers, but the resulting tone is unavoidably late.  Playing solo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doesn't solve it either because what you are hearing is the note that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you were humming, played as trumpets, not the one that you are trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to hum right now.   The actual note-rate (tempo) that can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; accomplished is really slow.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Audio-to-pitch *is* effectively a solved problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Latency is not an issue and the amount of DSP required to do this well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is dirt cheap.  For example, there exist cheap boxes that will do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;real-time pitch correction, a function which requires both detailed pitch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discrimination *and* artifact-free signal re-synthesis.  One popular one,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Antares Autotune, has a latency of &lt;4ms, which is effectively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instantaneous in audio terms (esp for live use).  In practice, solid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;implementations of these pitch discrimination/resynthesis algorithms are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transparent and highly effective.

<P>At the first CyberArts conference in L.A. in 1990 - the BEST digital arts 
<BR>
conference ever held! - a man who created the systems used by the big record 
<BR>
houses to clean up recordings demonstrated a live system into which he read 
<BR>
a poem.  He then stated that this system could take his input and output it 
<BR>
as ANY sound, retaining legibiilty.  Then he demonstrated it, having the 
<BR>
system speak back his vocalization, using the sound of waves crashing on a 
<BR>
beach.  It was waves crashing on a beach, reading poetry, retaining perfect 
<BR>
legibility and retaining his style.  Clearly, such a system could take my 
<BR>
rather lousy singing voice and map it to Caruso.  So, where can I buy it?
