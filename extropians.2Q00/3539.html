<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and I hesitate to call _anyone_ to carries an M-16 a &quot;dissident&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; did SAS kill dissidents? ... check
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please note the distinction between peaceful dissidents and armed terrorists.
</EM><BR>
<P>When the government has the authority to restrict your ability to practice peaceful protest and demonstration, and uses it, why do
<BR>
you wonder that the result is armed insurrection? You leave them no choice. When you've got no other options, and nothing left to
<BR>
lose, violence IS a viable option. If you are a member of the population that supports a government that opresses people this way,
<BR>
you deserve to become a target. Violent rebellion is a very direct indicator of how free segments of the population are. Those that
<BR>
refuse to acknowledge and understand this deserve their fate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Is there an Official Secrets Act? ... check  (and how is the FOI Act any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; different? New name the same dog?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And the US, of course, keeps no official secrets?
</EM><BR>
<P>How many newspapers have given a ratts behind, or can legally be forced by the government, to not print something just because the
<BR>
government doesn't want it to? The Official Secrets Act gives the PM the authority to censor any paper on national security
<BR>
grounds, perfectly legally, and prosecute anyone who doesn't obey. That can't happen here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Wasn't it you who criticised me once before, suggesting I thought I knew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the whole story about everything that goes on?
</EM><BR>
<P>The way the government handles things here is through propaganda, manipulation, and disinformation. While the question of whether
<BR>
this is better than overt government orders is obviously a good question to debate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; You say the income tax is lower? What are the brackets, the percentages? What are the deductions? What is the cost of living?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Value added tax? ... check
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since when exactly was the level of taxation directly inversely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proportional to how 'free' a country is? Unless one is arguing for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system of no taxation and public services at all, the specifics seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhat irrelevant.
</EM><BR>
<P>How much of your property the government feels it is free to confiscate does reflect on how free that country is. If you work half
<BR>
the year as a slave to the government, you are hardly free.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Would you cut all taxation? Make all public services optional private ones?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, why not?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Including policing? (threads merge...)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but not privatize as a distinct authority to a corporation, but a distributed, decentralized policing done by the citizens
<BR>
themselves.
