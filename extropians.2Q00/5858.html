<EM>&gt; I don't know where this discussion came from and only had time to quickly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; skim it on this busy morning, but the idea that extropianism is &quot;right wing&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the sense that that term is usually used in popular discourse is just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plain wrong.  The idea that it is anti-Semitic is so absurd that I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagine anyone coming to such a conclusion.
</EM><BR>
<P>It comes from leftist/socialist jews who can't imagine the thought of a jew not
<BR>
being leftist/socialist, so they automatically assume that anyone or any opinion
<BR>
that seems conservative or anti-socialist is automatically anti-semitic. Its the
<BR>
old 'if you're not for us, youre against us' routine. It is fairly endemic, esp
<BR>
among the PC enforcement types. Its much like statements I've seen from gay
<BR>
activists that if you aren't gay, you are a homophobe, or from feminists
<BR>
claiming that a male feminist is an oxymoron (Despite the fact of Alan Alda).
<BR>
<P>Such illogic also is extended to historical revisionism, such as claiming that
<BR>
the Nazi Party was not socialist, despite their name being the National
<BR>
Socialist Workers Party. Its granted that among socialist groups, they could be
<BR>
considered right wing socialists, but their being right wing due to their
<BR>
nationalism and bigotry does not prevent them from being socialists
<BR>
economically. Those that try to claim this anyways are of course the
<BR>
International Socialists, who can't imagine a socialist not being an
<BR>
internationalist as well, or as is being presently waged out on
<BR>
alt.society.anarchy, and other anarchist newsgroups, anarcho-socialists are
<BR>
trying to claim that true anarchists are socialists, and that anarcho-capitalism
<BR>
is an oxymoron, etc.
