<EM>&gt; Or, to say the same thing in the vocabulary of evolutionary biology, any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system containing replicating entities will tend to be dominated by those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entities which replicate most effectively. You can start with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 99.999999999% pure population of 'voluntary' non-replicators, and you will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still end up with an environment dominated by industrious replicators.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is assuming that the replicators retain their desire to replicate,
<BR>
and that there are no constraints on their replication.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Voluntary non-expansion on the scale of an entire civilization is only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible if there is no individual variation (i.e. a borganism). Voluntary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-expansion in a population of civilizations over evolutionary time is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only possible if all advanced civilizations inevitably converge to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-expanding borganism.
</EM><BR>
<P>What if there is a convention adopted by the entities involved that
<BR>
unconstrained replication is not allowed.  Any unconstrained replication
<BR>
is viewed as a threat and is prevented.  Some entities would like to
<BR>
replicate, but they cannot.  Most do not want to replicate, and attempt
<BR>
to prevent others from doing so.
<BR>
<P>This is a common theme explored in science fiction, where in an
<BR>
overpopulated world there are laws regulating the number of children.
<BR>
A moderate form of this is supposedly already being practiced in China.
<BR>
<P>It seems to me that this would be a stable situtation, and one which
<BR>
might be adopted because it produces a better outcome for the participants
<BR>
than they would get in a world of unconstrained replication.
