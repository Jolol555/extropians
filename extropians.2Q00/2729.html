<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Maybe I'm just being selfish, but I can't experience the life of that
</EM><BR>
other
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consciousness stream.  If I live, we will diverge.  If I die, I still
</EM><BR>
won't
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; live that other life.  I don't want that other consciousness stream to
</EM><BR>
take
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; over.  I prefer to find a way for this consciousness stream to continue.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Harvey, perhaps you could explain to me what this &quot;consciousness stream&quot;
</EM><BR>
is.
<BR>
<P>It is consciousness itself.  I think, therefore I am.  That's my
<BR>
consciousness stream.  As long as I keep having these thoughts, I am alive.
<BR>
<P>The more complicated question is what makes my consciousness more important
<BR>
to me than other people's consciousnesses?  Most people on this list take a
<BR>
functional view that personality and memory define our consciousness.  They
<BR>
claim that this is what makes people different and define people.  Therefore
<BR>
if someone else were programmed to think exactly like you and to remember
<BR>
your memories, that this person could replace you and you would be happy
<BR>
because this consciousess is exactly like the one it replaced.
<BR>
<P>I argue that this is not true.  What makes my consciousness unique to me is
<BR>
the direct interface I have in it.  I know what my consciousness is
<BR>
thinking.  I control my consciousness and its actions.  I have no such
<BR>
connection with other people's consciousness.  Even another person who
<BR>
thinks exactly as I do and has my exact memories would still be an alien,
<BR>
disconnected consciousness.  Unless it is somehow linked to me so that I can
<BR>
control it and know what it is thinking, this disconnected copy is not an
<BR>
acceptable replacement for me.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; But what is it made of?  Is it just bits?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  Bits define memory and program traits to run.  These bits can be stored
<BR>
on paper-tape, which is obviously not conscious.  The bits themelves do not
<BR>
have this trait of growing, self-modifying, interacting with the universe,
<BR>
or making decisions.  Instead of bits, the consciousness would be the CPU
<BR>
that is executing those bits.  The CPU that keeps changing its execution
<BR>
register is a living consciousness.  The CPU that stops running, such that
<BR>
its register never changes, is a hung processor or a dead consciousness.  It
<BR>
has lost all of its properties of consciousness, even if its physical body,
<BR>
memory bits and program bits remain intact.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Meanwhile, back at the Harvey that exists in wet ware,  what good does it
</EM><BR>
do you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to write this thing
</EM><BR>
<P>Not sure what thing you are referring to here.  (sorry.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At this point I expect you will want to trot out the old &quot;I don't know
</EM><BR>
what it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is, but if I gradually replace one neuron at a time, I will get there&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument.  Yes, you will get somewhere, but until something is known about
</EM><BR>
what
<BR>
<EM>&gt; this process does in real life, who can say who will be we.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wasn't going to trot this out, but as you state &quot;I&quot; will get somewhere.
<BR>
As long as I am still alive somewhere, I don't care how much I have changed.
<BR>
I hope that I change for the better, but even changing for the worse is not
<BR>
as bad as no change ever (which I call death).
