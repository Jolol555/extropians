<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;A possible scenario in a transparent society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;What do the police officers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;do now, take my word that I intend no harm and hope that I am not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;deceiving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;them. Confiscate the &quot;Bomb&quot; making material depriving me of its use for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;harmless purposes, or maybe they ought to !
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;arrest me as a potential threat to public safety.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As you have (presumably) committed no crime, there is nothing the police can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legally do to you, other than watch you to see if you actually commit a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crime.  It is not illegal to purchase legal items, no matter how dangerous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they may be.  A transparent society, in and of itself wouldn't change that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Right now you can buy tons of fertilizer and fuel (presuming there hasn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been some legal limit imposed following OK. City), you can also buy hundreds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of semi-auto weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition.  The police
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't do anything to you but observe unless and until you break a law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It would be against the law to arrest you as a &quot;potential threat&quot; to public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; safety.  If that were the law, there wouldn't be a single &quot;gang-banger&quot; left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the streets.  Public surveillance would admittedly be uncomfortable at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first, but I continue to maintain that for most law abiding-citizens it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would eventually become as acceptable a nuisance as traffic signals.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is completely untrue. There have been numerous cases of people
<BR>
convicted of mere posession of items that posess the potential to be
<BR>
used in crimina actvities, even activites far less dangerous than a
<BR>
bombing. Kevin Mitnick, for example, was once arrested and convicted, as
<BR>
have numerous other hackers, for the mere posession of a pocket
<BR>
autodialer, an item you can buy at Radio Shack for $10. They were
<BR>
convicted for the sole reason that they knew how to alter these
<BR>
autodialers, or had altered the autodialers, to make them capable of
<BR>
being used to get phone services on payphones for free. None was ever
<BR>
actually caught in the act of using an altered autodialer in making a
<BR>
phone call on a payphone.
<BR>
<P>Now, take the Oklahoma City bombing. Very few people don't think McVeigh
<BR>
did it. Its pretty much assumed he is guilty. But why do people assume
<BR>
that? Every bit of evidence is completely circumstantial. I'm even
<BR>
pretty sure he did it, though I don't think he and Nichols were alone,
<BR>
and there is evidence just as strong as that they were convicted on that
<BR>
they were dupes in a government staged event.
<BR>
<P>Now, lets assume that another bombing has occured. Mr. Powers happens to
<BR>
a) have a deisel tractor (and a fuel tank to keep it fuelled), b) be a
<BR>
farmer, so he has a lot of fertilizer, c) be an electronics hobbyist,
<BR>
and enjoy making remote control devices, d) be known to have made up
<BR>
explosives in the past and used them on his private property simply for
<BR>
the purpose of clearing stumps (as is the case with thousands of farmers
<BR>
and other property owners all over the country), e) have in the past
<BR>
written letters to the editor of his local paper decrying the activities
<BR>
of an organization or government agency that happened to have had
<BR>
offices or facilities at the site of the bombing, f) have been stopped
<BR>
for a traffic violation on the day of the bombing within 20 miles of the
<BR>
bombing location. Under the rules of evidence and the prosecutorial
<BR>
procedure used in the Oklahoma case, its is pretty much an open and shut
<BR>
case that Mr. Powers is the bomber in this event. No eyewitnesses are
<BR>
needed to place him on the scene at the time of the bombing, no
<BR>
eyewitnesses are needed to prove that he actually made the bomb.
<BR>
<P>This IS how justice gets done today in America.
