<P><EM>&gt; Can anyone who was at the Stanford April 1 event with

<EM>&gt; Hofstaedter et al, give a synopsis for those of us who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live a few thousand kilometers away and couldn't make it :-(  ?

<P>Amara, there were tapes being made but I was standing
<BR>
near the Douglas before the pitch overheard his discomfort
<BR>
that there were several videotape machines as well as
<BR>
a buncha nerds with microrecorders.  He had intended
<BR>
on making a videotape commercially available, so I dont
<BR>
know if he wanted any transcripts to be made, as I volunteered
<BR>
to help a fellow extropian prepare.  I will put together a
<BR>
nerds-eye view of the event in more detail later but right
<BR>
now a bicycle is calling my name.
<BR>
<P>Let me interject this one comment.  I had read Bill Joy's
<BR>
article in Wired, and came with many misconceptions.
<BR>
Had he published his exact pitch at the nerdfest instead
<BR>
of what was actually published, he mighta convinced more.
<BR>
Considering he was up before a hostile audience, he did
<BR>
an admirable job.  Now of course our own Ralph Merkle
<BR>
did a far better job, but anyway...
<BR>
<P>I didnt change my mind about neo-ludditism, but Bill does
<BR>
have some strong arguments about the dangers of future-tech
<BR>
that need to be addressed.  My own company has demonstrated
<BR>
that all philosophical arguments go out the window when there
<BR>
is money to be made.  I dont suppose this unattractive feature
<BR>
of human nature will change any time soon.  spike
