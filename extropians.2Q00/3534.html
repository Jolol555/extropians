&nbsp;&nbsp;The following comment on Sasha's shocking and tragic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;death evoked that which follows that quoted comment.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize I'm assuming Sasha took his own life and I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;don't know that for a fact, but that seems to be the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;situation based on the many posts I just read in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;extropian-list archive. I apologize to Sasha's family
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if in fact his death was not a suicide...

<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: It's tragic for we the living that Sasha,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such a bright, creative, and motivated person
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;killed himself. It's bewildering and inexplicable.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just because we don't like it and it hurts us
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does not mean it was a symptom of a disease, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thus that brilliant Sasha had a diseased mind. It
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means that Sasha, for whatever reasons, valued
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nonexistence over existence. It was a subjective
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value judgement. To define subjective personal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value judgements as a disease is to presume that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is some kind of objective value judgement,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thus all contrary judgments are diseased by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;definition and to be eradicated by corrective and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often coercive &quot;medical&quot; intervention. I tend to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side with Thomas Szasz, that psychiatry is social
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control masquerading as a branch of medicine.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As convincing as biological theories of so-called
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;psychiatric illnesses&quot; can be, I believe they may
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fail under critical analysis. Enjoyment of music can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be linked to neurological conditions, but that does
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not mean enjoying music is a brain disease. Feeling
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good can be linked to neurological conditions, but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that does not mean feeling good is a mental illness.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too, feeling bad can be linked to neurological
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conditions, but that does not mean it's a disease.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems as if biological psychiatry assumes that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that's needed to be done is show that there are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specific neurological conditions that can be linked
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the mental states some have defined as &quot;diseased.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If serotonin can be shown to be lower in those with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depression or who committed suicide, then it's been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;established that depression is a biological disease;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that does nothing of the sort. The &quot;disease&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label is still a subjective value judgement that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the given behaviors or feelings are not appropriate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and should be corrected. Even if the mental states are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a result of specific attributes of serotonin metabolism
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that are genetic, this is no more evidence of a disease,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or genetic disease, than claiming that ugly big noses
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are a disease because a big nose can be linked to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inherited biological developmental &quot;abnormalities.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people are unhappy with their biological state then
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they can try to modify it. But just because a person
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is unhappy with their nose does not mean their nose
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a disease. Psychiatry should be viewed in terms of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cosmetic, not medical, intervention. Is a big nose
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right or wrong? Is suicidal depression right or wrong?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are value judgements that need to be left to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the individual. Biological psychiatry is like cosmetic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surgeons going around defining ugliness as a disease
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that must be treated with &quot;medical&quot; interventions.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as we grieve over the loss of Sasha, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over realizing how much more he could have contributed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had he chose life over death, we have to respect his
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choices, however much they hurt us. It is wrong for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us to tell Sasha his value judgement was a disease;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doing so is imposing our values on others in such a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way that it inflicts injury on those with other values.
