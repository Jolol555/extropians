<P>
I was on a crypto panel discussion the other day, and as we chatted
<BR>
afterwards I learned that the moderator, an interesting and pleasant
<BR>
guy, had recently received a windfall in the hundreds of millions of
<BR>
dollars.  He is Mark Shuttleworth, the head of Thawte Communications,
<BR>
a South African crypto certificate company which was recently acquired
<BR>
by Verisign, the big US certifier.
<BR>
<P>Due to South African regulations, the money must be &quot;repatriated&quot;
<BR>
to African, which I gather means that it is not just stock options,
<BR>
but actual cash.  I asked if he was going to be carrying it back with
<BR>
him in a briefcase chained to his wrist, but Mark said that these days
<BR>
six hundred million dollars can be transferred with just a fax.
<BR>
<P>His plans for the money involve funding various startups and ventures
<BR>
in Africa in the hopes of improving the terrible conditions there.
<BR>
In particular he hopes that improving communications so as to make
<BR>
Internet access widespread will go a long way towards alleviating the
<BR>
ignorance and government control which has kept the continent in chains
<BR>
for so long.
<BR>
<P>He talked about the example of Senegal, whose socialist government
<BR>
has been rigging elections for 40 years, until this past March when
<BR>
an opposition party candidate won the presidency, an event virtually
<BR>
unprecedented in Africa.  Mark attributed this change in large part
<BR>
to the existence of private radio stations and cell phones, which made
<BR>
true and accurate information more widely available and prevented the
<BR>
election stealing that had gone on in the past.
<BR>
<P>We have had speculation here about what might happen if people mired
<BR>
in the abject poverty which prevails in so much of the world could be
<BR>
given access to modern information technology.  Will the truth truly
<BR>
make them free?  If Mark's visionary and optimistic plans go through
<BR>
as he hopes, we may have a chance to find out.
<BR>
