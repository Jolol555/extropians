<EM>&gt; &gt; Although I tend toward the &quot;bleeding heart&quot; end of the spectrum, I look 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; capital punishment as a cost vs. benefit analysis.  You got a human scum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (say, Charlie Manson) who has amply demonstrated that he will never be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for anything except warming a prison cell.  Do we keep him alive for no 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reason until he wastes away, at a cost of umpteen thousand dollars per 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;year,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or do we put him and us out of our mutual misery by killing and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cremating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; him at a cost of a few thousand and be done with it?  The answer to me 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; obvious.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Unless you take into account the possibility that he might be innocent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but wrongly convicted. Here in the UK, they've tightened up the appeals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and miscarriages-of-justice process a bit in the past few years, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;added DNA testing to the battery of forensic techniques available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The result is that roughly 10-15% of historic &quot;guilty&quot; verdicts are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being overturned, in crimes as serious as murder.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Face it, the judicial system is a system created by human beings. As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such, it is fallible -- even without side-issues like police corruption
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and political interference.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Think of that nice warm prison cell Charlie Manson sleeps in every night
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as YOUR personal insurance premium against being summarily executed for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a crime you didn't commit.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm.  That, as they say, is a good point.
