<P>
The only time I've ever been in east LA was once when I was driving a car
<BR>
and took the wrong exit off the freeway.  I felt very uncomfortable and got
<BR>
out of there as quickly as I could.
<BR>
<P>I've had a bad experience in a neighborhood where I was the only white
<BR>
person around, but let me tell you about a good one:
<BR>
<P>I was riding my bicycle in Austin, Texas (which is very different from LA,
<BR>
although I understand from the kids I knew who were in the Latin Kings gang
<BR>
that Austin was inheriting quite a few gang types from LA) one afternoon and
<BR>
after taking a wrong turn found myself in a neighborhood where I was the
<BR>
only white person--it was a public housing project.  I felt uncomfortable
<BR>
being there, so I turned around to backtrack and try to get back where I
<BR>
wanted to be. My attention was distracted by a building whose entire north
<BR>
wall was covered with a colorful mural, so I didn't notice a speed bump in
<BR>
the road until I'd hit it.  I was going pretty fast, and I was on a racing
<BR>
bike, which was kinda squirrely if you didn't stay on top of it.  I flew off
<BR>
the bike and landed with my back just the wrong way across the curb.  I
<BR>
couldn't get up. It was the weirdest feeling to not be able to make my body
<BR>
work!  So I was thinking, &quot;Oh, great.  I'm now at the mercy of these black
<BR>
people who probably hate whites.&quot;
<BR>
<P>But what happened was this: The people started coming out of their
<BR>
apartments to help me.  One brought an umbrella and held it over my head to
<BR>
keep the sun out of my face.  Another brought a pillow to put under my head.
<BR>
Another picked up my bike and gently leaned it against a tree. Another one
<BR>
brought a damp towel to wipe the ants off my legs (to compound my woes, I'd
<BR>
landed next to an ant bed). Another went to call an ambulance after telling
<BR>
the others that they shouldn't try to move me. They couldn't have been
<BR>
kinder to someone who was one of their own.  It was one of the most touching
<BR>
things I've ever experienced. Really, it was almost worth having a broken
<BR>
back and pelvis just to experience such kindness from strangers.
<BR>
<P>When the ambulance arrived, the EMS people were rude to my newly found
<BR>
friends and told them to get out of the way.  I could understand that they
<BR>
had to do their job, but I felt terrible that they were being so rude to
<BR>
these people who'd helped me so much.

<EM>&gt; You've been very lucky.  Not that I don't try the same sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the time, but there have been times when I was definitely in real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physical danger.
