<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would say it would be a good idea for those that carry guns for government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; carry recording devices that were both required to be on when on duty,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It would be easy with current technology to make gun-cams for all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cops, that starts recording the second the weapon is withdrawn from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the holster.  Would *anyone* object to such a thing?  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wouldn't. Considering how much more likely a cop is to kill an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; innocent person than a gun carrying civilian at a crime scene, it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definitely help prevent cover-ups as well as contribute to better on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; job training using the video footage in 'hogans alley' type shooting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; training.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think anyone would object to all police guns being recorded.  However, I
<BR>
don't see why not to record all on-duty activities.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, I'd recommend that the cameras be turned on in any of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following circumstances:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) whenever the cop wants to turn it on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; b) whenever his heart rate/bp rise above a certain level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; c) whenever the dispatcher remotely activates it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; d) whenever the vehicle siren is activated
</EM><BR>
<P>Recording should just be on all the time.  Currently, many state troopers carry
<BR>
radios, the first step is to supply them with one that records continuously.  The
<BR>
next step after that is video inputs.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; THe camera could only be turned off under the following conditions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) the cops heart rate/bp drops below a certain level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; b) the dispatcher or others at the precinct deactivate it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; c) the vehicle sirens and/or lights are turned off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; d) there are no prisoners held in the vehicle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By the time a situation has deteriorated to the point where a cop needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to pull out his gun, there have already been things occuring that are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contributing to the situation and should be recorded to determine if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cop was correct in a feeling that the situation had escalated, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he had done whatever he could prior to that to not need to pull the gun.
</EM><BR>
<P>Due to the marginal cost of storage, there will be little point to ever turn it
<BR>
off.  Admittedly, and happily, that will yield a lot of boring tape, most of it
<BR>
never reviewed,  but otherwise it is not a tool of the people.
<BR>
<P>If the record is automatically recorded locally and sent almost immediately to a
<BR>
central location, then there would be few lost tapes, and any would be irregular and
<BR>
subject for internal investigation.
<BR>
<P>There is no point to ever record anywhere else, because Americans are by default
<BR>
considered innocent.  So, to whatever extent the government does, it is violating
<BR>
the rules of search.
<BR>
<P>You can read some of my previous posts about shopping mall cameras for more of my
<BR>
views of private non-government sponsored monitoring.
