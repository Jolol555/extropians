<EM>&gt; &gt; The best numbers I find are from John Lott. Read his &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot;

<EM>&gt; What do you think of Gary Kleck's book with regard to veracity,

<EM>&gt; supportability, and sound evidence?

<P>Kleck has reviewed quite a bit of data, and Lott refers to much of his
<BR>
work as well. There is some question or doubt by some as to Kleck's
<BR>
claim that there are 2.5 million defensive gun uses per year. His study
<BR>
was based on a survey of several thousand people. The FBI crime data
<BR>
says that there are only about 80,000 defensive gun uses, but these are
<BR>
only gun uses that are a) reported to the police, and b) that the police
<BR>
choose to include in their reports. Why would there be so much under
<BR>
reporting? Mainly because so many otherwise law abiding people own guns
<BR>
illegally because their state law does not allow them to own guns, but
<BR>
they do anyways (these people include many celebrities, politicians,
<BR>
etc, even people who are otherwise against other people having guns);
<BR>
additionally many police who know the victims will frequently leave such
<BR>
information out of reports because they don't want their friends
<BR>
investigated by zealous liberal prosecutors. STATS has reviewed a large
<BR>
number of such studies and come up with a median figure of some 787,000
<BR>
defensive gun uses per year, which is still more than 100 times more
<BR>
than the criminal offensive uses. 
<BR>
<P>Karsten's reference of there being 14,000 gun murders in the US, BTW, is
<BR>
innacurate. That is the total number of homicides that are not suicides.
<BR>
6,000 of these, as I recall, are justifiable homicides by policemen,
<BR>
with  the remainder, with the remainder I think 60/40 split between
<BR>
defensive justifiable homicides and criminal homicides. According to
<BR>
STATS, there is a net positive benefit to the economy if law abiding
<BR>
civilians kill at least 2,000 criminals per year defensively, which
<BR>
reaches between $1 billion to 30 billion when that number surpasses
<BR>
3,000 (variance is based on what you call 'costs').
