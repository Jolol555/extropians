Yeah, one of the smartest people I know, whose opinion I generally respect,
<BR>
didn't like the book.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked it overall, although I didn't agree with all the author's
<BR>
conclusions.  What I like about Diamond is that he's actually hung out with
<BR>
members of existing tribes, lived among the people as a friend rather than
<BR>
staying aloof and studying them.  True, this might result in some loss of
<BR>
objectivity, but I think it gives a person a much better opportunity to
<BR>
begin to understand tribal life. (Diamond does make the statement, by the
<BR>
way, that murder is a far more common cause of death among tribal people
<BR>
than among civilized people)
<BR>
<P>One problem with making a generalized statement about tribes is that, you
<BR>
know, there are tribes, and then there are tribes. It's like trying to
<BR>
generalize about &quot;all men&quot; and &quot;all women.&quot;

<EM>&gt; I haven't read Diamond's book -- it's gotten strong pro and con
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reviews from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people I respect, which means I ought to read it, I suppose.  Put another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; round in the clip!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the face of your desciption of his definition of &quot;tribal&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leadership, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have some fairly deep doubts about it's empirical validity.  More comment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from me will have to await my reading of his book.
