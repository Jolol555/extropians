<P>
In the April 28 issue of &quot;Science&quot; ,the one about the improvement
<BR>
in cloning technology, I found the following two paragraphs, they
<BR>
seem important to me, I'd like somebody to tell me why I'm wrong.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&quot; Another sign that the cloning process had somehow turned back
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the clock on the animals' cells came when the team cultured
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fibroblasts, a type of connective tissue cell, from the calves' ears.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cells expressed high levels of a gene called EPC-1, which is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typically found at high levels in young cells and may be involved in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cell division and proliferation.&quot;
<BR>
<P>An imperial result independent of telomeres that seems to indicate
<BR>
the cells really are more youthful, or rather act more youthfully.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&quot;In a related experiment, the team cloned five calf fetuses from adult cells
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;kept in culture until senescence. They removed the fetuses at 6 weeks
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of gestation so they could compare their cells with those of normal fetal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;calves. The clones' cells divided an average of 93 times compared to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;only 61 for cells from normal calves. If this increased life-span extends
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to the whole animal, Lanes says, there is &quot;a real possibility&quot; that cloned
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;animals might live as much as 50% longer than their normal counterparts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;--up to 180 to 200 years in the case of humans--an idea, he says, that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;is going to raise an eyebrow or two.&quot;&quot;
<BR>
<P>That's even more direct evidence. I grant you it still doesn't prove the entire animal
<BR>
will live longer but it does give considerable weight to that idea; and a increase
<BR>
from 61 to 93 divisions is not small and is not theoretical, it's a concrete
<BR>
experimental result. I know Robert  Bradbury has expressed some contempt for
<BR>
this work but I confess I just don't understand why. Perhaps the effect was caused
<BR>
because the telomeres got longer, perhaps it was caused by something else, but
<BR>
whatever the reason the result if true is pretty damn interesting. And I happen to think
<BR>
it probably is true, I mean It's not like the report came out of The National Enquirer,
<BR>
&quot;Science  along with &quot;Nature&quot; are the two most respected science journals in the world.
