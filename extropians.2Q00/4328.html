<EM>&gt; If the universe is infinite, all that means is that it will continue 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expanding forever.  That doesn't mean that energy will remain in an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exploitable state forever.  Once entropy has increased to the point where 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy is effectively useless (nothing but background radiation), life 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which is dependent upon the exploitation of energy) is done for.  
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first, i'm no expert either. as i understand it, the threat posed
<BR>
by an expanding universe to a transhuman civilization is more urgent
<BR>
than eventual heat death resulting from entropy.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the problem seems to be that as the universe expands to ever
<BR>
greater &quot;volume,&quot; its density approaches a vacuum. eventually, this may
<BR>
pose increasingly stringent limits on feasible civilizations and
<BR>
life-forms (as, for example, the averge energy cost to travel
<BR>
between two stars exceeds the energy extracted from an average
<BR>
star).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from what i gather, however, a flat universe would continue to
<BR>
expand, but at an ever-slowing rate -- approaching a standstill at
<BR>
infinite time. if this were true, perhaps heat death does once again
<BR>
become the main bottleneck. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what i find absolutely intriguing is the very possiblity that the
<BR>
universe is flat. i trust that members of this list do not need any
<BR>
reminders as to what eerie odds would be overcome if such were really
<BR>
the case. funny that a year ago, few would have considered such a
<BR>
possiblity -- the universe was either open or closed, and open
<BR>
looked more likely ...
