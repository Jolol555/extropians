While watching the news of the forced split of Microsoft last night, I was
<BR>
again witness to the admirable but infuriating assertion by Bill Gates that
<BR>
he was confident that &quot;...justice would be served in the end.&quot;
<BR>
Unfortunately, I don't believe it.  What I can't understand is why such
<BR>
driven, high profile and all-around successful people choose to work within
<BR>
a system which frequently works against them.  MS has done far more for the
<BR>
government (and indeed, the public as a whole) than the government has done
<BR>
for them.
<BR>
<P>As one who deeply respects Gates and Microsoft, I want MS to resume as it
<BR>
has for the last decade: innovative, growing and successful; working within
<BR>
a system which has none of those facets makes it hard for me to see how it
<BR>
can be done.
