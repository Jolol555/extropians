<P>
Brian and everyone here!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to CC a message from philosophy but I guess Extropian doesn't allow 
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say a quick word about this Natasha-Brian business. Because I 
<BR>
feel Brian has been singled out here unfairly, my comments will be slanted 
<BR>
in his favor, but, combined with the absurd things people have said about 
<BR>
him, that might provide the best overall view. (Also, I'm one of the few 
<BR>
people on this list who has met him in the flesh - what little there is ;)
<BR>
<P>First, about Brian.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's smart, *very* smart. ultra-whiz-kid type smart.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, he takes intellectual disagreements very very seriously and 
<BR>
assumes other people do the same. He also assumes people are smarter than 
<BR>
they actually are. You often hear people with IQs of 170 (or whatever 
<BR>
Brian's is) constantly talking about how stupid people are. I very rarely 
<BR>
have heard something like this from him (except about his girlfriend, during 
<BR>
the 'bad years' ;).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What follows? Well, things that others as smart as he is might take as 
<BR>
signs of stupidity Brian takes as *moral* failings. 'If she didn't 
<BR>
understand what I meant by 'reference trauma' [or the evening star bit], 
<BR>
it's not because she's stupid, it's because she's too lazy to look it up' 
<BR>
(i.e., he rules out that the person looked it up and just didn't follow it). 
<BR>
'So if she attributes ill-will to me based on a misunderstanding of 
<BR>
'reference trauma', she's doing it on * purpose*, to piss me off, or insult 
<BR>
me or whatever'. 'How incredibly cruel'!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what you all see as an out of the blue insult to a sweet innocent lady, 
<BR>
Brian sees as the natural response to a vicious, malicious wounding by a 
<BR>
human being who has acted *extremely* badly.
<BR>
<P><P>Second, *to* Brian.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're going to end up feeling like shit if you keep this up. I agree with 
<BR>
everything you've said (from the start of this thread), and think you have 
<BR>
conducted yourself extremely well and I might add brilliantly.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, you've walked into a close-knit community (which does seem a 
<BR>
little cultoid, but that might not be bad). There's no way they won't be 
<BR>
heavily slanted against you. That's why asses like 'altamira' and Doug Jones 
<BR>
feel like they can chime in without have read the relevant posts-
<BR>
<P>altamira wrote:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I didn't see the original posts on the Transhuman List which led up to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussion on this list, which deteriorated to personal name-calling, so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can't make any useful comments about the relative merit of the ideas being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But I CAN say that .....
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read that I nearly fell off my chair. What gall! Comments like this 
<BR>
are pretty solid evidence that there's at least something cult-like about 
<BR>
this group. They are not interested in finding out what's correct they're 
<BR>
interested in placing dissenters in a gulag.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, although I am at least as astonished as you that people 
<BR>
criticized you for your comment and *didn't* criticize Natasha for hers, 
<BR>
there's obviously a reason for it. I think tribalism or cultishness is one 
<BR>
likely explanation, but the other is simply that these people are from a 
<BR>
very different world than you. Whether it's a better or worse world is not 
<BR>
as relevant as the fact of its difference from yours (and mine). Consider 
<BR>
what you wrote here:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
The problem -- at least one -- seems to be that you think there's nothing 
<BR>
wrong with being stupid or lazy or tribal (PLEASE don't miss the &quot;or&quot; -- by 
<BR>
the way, I assume it's mostly the third in the case of Natasha, though I 
<BR>
don't kjnow her well enough to be certain -- note, further, I'm not 100% 
<BR>
certain there isn't some other explanation), and/or -- this is more likely 
<BR>
-- that you think the degree of her misreading of my posts was low enough 
<BR>
that I didn't need to mobilize any such hypotheses. Given that I claimed 
<BR>
(with some evidence) that the degree was indeed high, why not engage me on 
<BR>
that very point: &quot;Brian, you're attributing ill-will to Natasha because you 
<BR>
think she's willfully misreading your posts? I disagree. Here's why: 1. When 
<BR>
she criticizes you for attributing some sort of childishness to her or her 
<BR>
choice of lovers because of the word choice, 'boyfriend,' you have to 
<BR>
understand that our community in LA uses the term 'man-friend' for male 
<BR>
adult lovers.... 2. ....&quot; (etc. -- just an example)
<BR>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how much effort it would take for most people to parse the 
<BR>
logic of this *and* to think about whether your numerous complicated ethical 
<BR>
assumptions are correct?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't get me wrong. I agree with you *completely*. Max's response to you 
<BR>
was not only one-sided, it was amazingly simplistic.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But consider the other assumption as to the cause. What's easy for you 
<BR>
might be very difficult and time-consuming for others. It might not be a 
<BR>
moral failing, exactly. People vary in what's between their ears, not just 
<BR>
what's in their hearts.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, given that the errors of others might not be obvious or even 
<BR>
apprehensible to most reading your posts, and *also* that they don't share 
<BR>
your view about the badness of error, you can't expect them to have sympathy 
<BR>
for you, or to be willing to cut you slack.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you've been seriously wronged here. If this were our list Natasha 
<BR>
and Max would have been laughed off for their idiocy or laziness. The 
<BR>
reaction you manifested would have seemed tame.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you are in Rome! The more you argue the more the cultists will draw 
<BR>
their weapons. Cork it, for your own sake!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest coming back to the philosophy list!!!!!!
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to altimira, Doug Jones, Max, and Natasha: you clearly owe Brian an 
<BR>
apology. When the members to say nothing of the leadership (!) of an 
<BR>
Institute claiming to do good act in this way, with this degree of stupidity 
<BR>
and insensitivity, it doesn't bode well for the success of that Institute.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until I hear some apologies for the way people have treated Brian, I'm 
<BR>
officially an anti-Extropian.
