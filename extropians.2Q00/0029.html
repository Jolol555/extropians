<EM>&gt;     &gt;The cost of disassembling a large unique collection of atoms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;(to isotopic specificity) and reassembling it *identically*, is probably *very* large.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No need to do it identically, I change when I drink a cup of coffee but I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still the same person. I think. Well, at least there's nothing else around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that could make a better claim to the title.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are still the 99% physical you that you were a minute ago, so the
<BR>
coffee is diluted and is incorporated into you by your digestive system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;I'm sure that most will agree that the transistors in those processors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;*are not* identical at  the atomic scale.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And the wires in the power supply of two computers may have different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colors but if they're running the same program it really doesn't matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the two computers are self aware, it doesn't matter that they have
<BR>
identical processors and motherboards. Identity is in awareness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;Within milliseconds of the copying process however, neither of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;is &quot;an original&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly. It doesn't matter who the original is because you can only have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a true &quot;original&quot; if there is no change and life by its very nature is change.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In other words, if it's really original then it's dead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>Uh oh, John is trotting out the old canard that twins are
<BR>
interchangeable, so its ok to off one of them, since you have a spare. I
<BR>
mean, they are genetically identical, right? So they are the same
<BR>
creature, produced in duplicate. By Johns reasoning you can whack one of
<BR>
them with no consequences. Cops say,&quot;But you killed Bill here.&quot; John
<BR>
replies,&quot;No I didn't, this is an identical copy of Bill right here, so
<BR>
he is still alive and well. That there was simply an extra copy of Bill
<BR>
that was hanging around taking up space, making odd noises about how he
<BR>
was an individual...&quot;
<BR>
<P>Are there any twins on the list???
