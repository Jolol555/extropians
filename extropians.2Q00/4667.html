<P><EM>    &gt; The only reason corporations can't use violence is because there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; someone bigger and nastier who won't let them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, government has a monopoly on violence and are abusing their dominant
<BR>
position in that area beyond anything Microsoft could dream of.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;I think there are instances where regulation can improve the functioning of a market.
</EM><BR>
<P>It might be helpful to have an all wise disinterested third party who regulated
<BR>
computer software with a gentle hand, it might be helpful to have a perpetual
<BR>
motion machine too but you're not going to find either one in the real world.
<BR>
Scientific savvy is not a skill needed to get to the top in politics and petty civil
<BR>
servants are never disinterested or gentle, they're always trying to expand their
<BR>
little fiefdom to demonstrate how important they are, if they didn't have that sort
<BR>
of personality they wouldn't have gotten into that line of work. So we were not
<BR>
just unlucky, we'll always get somebody like Janet Reno running the show.
<BR>
<P>As for the Supreme Court who will make the final decision in the Microsoft case,
<BR>
their engineering ignorance is legendary. They were the last government
<BR>
department to get on the Web and I'll bet 5 out of 9 judges haven't touched a
<BR>
keyboard, even a typewriter keyboard, in at least a decade and if prompted by a
<BR>
screen to hit any key would start searching for the &quot;any key&quot;. And yet these
<BR>
technological illiterates will decide the direction computer science will move into as
<BR>
we start the 21 century. The Free Market is not perfect (what is?) but it works
<BR>
pretty damn well, don't mess with it.

<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P><P><P><P>&nbsp;It does not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; logically follow that I think government ought to be deciding how many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bars of soap get manufactured.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So, what do you do when a company you consider to be inferior comes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dominate the market? Accusing them of evil anti-competitive practices misses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the point - companies would do the same kinds of things in a stateless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; society, and in that case there would be no one to stop them. No, there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; really only two viable explanations: either free markets don't actually work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; very well, or your personal evaluation of which companies ought to do well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is somehow flawed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Free markets work, in general, very well indeed - that doesn't mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there aren't situations when they don't. Who 'ought to do well' is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; function of what you're trying to optimize.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Now, the interesting thing here is that our standard arguments for why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; central control is bad predict that the second explanation will usually be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; correct. In general, I can't reliably tell which product is best for you,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you can't predict which one is best for me, and neither of us can speak for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Tom, Dick or Harry. It should therefore not be surprising if the dominant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; product in an industry isn't the one you like - all that means is that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the market has different needs than yours.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then government is optimal. Model the historical evolution of top-down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control as a bottom-up market process and the aggregate result of billions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; locally  rational, self-interested decisions. If you don't think the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political/economic system won the market, you're just another mistaken expert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to out-guess the emergent result.
