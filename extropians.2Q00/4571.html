<P>
What is the mechanism so that citizens may introduce legislation into
<BR>
the legislature?  I am aware there are mechanisms to get public
<BR>
referendums on ballots by gathering a certain quantity of validated
<BR>
signatures of citizens.
<BR>
<P>I guess what I am finding is a flaw in our representative democracy in
<BR>
that the representatives aren't representative of the interests of the
<BR>
people who elected them, for lack of any better one.
<BR>
<P>In this age of modern technology, we should use some of it to enable
<BR>
cyber-grassroots mobilization.  What has come to mind is a web interface
<BR>
to a wwide variety of proposed legislation, a clearinghouse for it, as
<BR>
it were.  Say that as a U.S. citizen you can write suggested legislation
<BR>
on any of a variety of topics that are legislatable.  Then, legislation
<BR>
is organized so that different topics and causes will have compromises
<BR>
hammered, or separate proposals if they are incompatible.  Then, as
<BR>
legislation is developed in this virtual town hall federally and for
<BR>
each region, separately or as one, then as legislation passes through a
<BR>
public peer-review process and reaches the point where credible
<BR>
volunteers vouch for its Consitutionality and value depending on other
<BR>
merits, then the legislation is fast-tracked into the requisite forms
<BR>
for each jurisdiction, ie, from electronic community, communication,
<BR>
discussion, review, and mobilization, then the real world requirements
<BR>
for placement in the processes of legislation are fulfilled, and the
<BR>
virtual communities' mobilization is used locally and extra-locally to
<BR>
satisfy any requirements, where some of the first legislation might be
<BR>
to enable electronic satisfaction of the requirements.
<BR>
<P>As electronic signatures are now as valid as written signatures, they
<BR>
may be used to denote citzens' affirmation of some proposeed legislation
<BR>
to be considered for public referendum, or even to be de facto proposed
<BR>
as sponsored by the locale in regular legislature.
<BR>
<P>This leads to some other issues, for example, a citizen may choose to
<BR>
develop a profile of his/her views that are shared or not,
<BR>
incrementally, depending upon his preferences about it.
<BR>
<P>This might be seen as being about reforming the government, but moreso
<BR>
it is about making the government (here in the U.S.) more as it was
<BR>
designed to be more than two hundred years ago, representative of its
<BR>
citizens.
