<EM>&gt; &gt;Sorry Max, and apologies to all who take offense. However you ARE 3/4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;British, right? ;) I keep hearing all sorts of lame arguments about how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anyone white owes black people, native americans, japanese, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;apologies for what SOME white people did, yet these same people don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;want the same argument applied to them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You might want to stop and take a breath before firing off your replies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seems you've been getting a little over the top lately (even for you).  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't know where you've been hearing those &quot;lame arguments&quot; about apologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; owing from anyone white.  Never heard any of that myself.  I have heard some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noises every once and a while from blacks (and perhaps others) who feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entitled to reparations *from the government* for what happened to slaves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and their descendants in the US, but nothing like &quot;we want every white
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person in America to say they're sorry.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>There are quite a number of people who feel just that way. Their claims
<BR>
are that if you are a member of a race that has benefited from racism
<BR>
that means that you personally have benefitted from racism, so you are a
<BR>
racist by association, a sort of racial equivalent that a person who
<BR>
fences stolen goods is no different from the people who steal the goods
<BR>
he sells.
<BR>
<P>All of this racial crap just disgusts me to no end (from both sides),
<BR>
which is why I put 'human' down for my race on my census form...
