I suggest that you check out the ISIL site.  The line you're taking is 
<BR>
consistent with the concept of anarchocapitalism as expounded by Jarret 
<BR>
Wollstein, Morris and Linda Tannehill and the other leading lights of the 
<BR>
early modern libertarian movement.  In what I'm starting to think more of as 
<BR>
a &quot;contractual society,&quot; you would have to cover the provable risks your 
<BR>
actions created.  I.e., if you want to store high explosives, much less 
<BR>
nukes, then the risk factor might be astronomical in the suburbs, and the 
<BR>
bonds or insurance premiums to match.
<BR>
<P>Thus, the insurance companies would have a major vested interest - as today 
<BR>
- in detecting individuals who paid a premium lower than the actual 
<BR>
actuarial risk they engendered.  Naturally, criminals would fall into that 
<BR>
category rather much.  The ubiquitous surveilance would be welcomed by most 
<BR>
people for the fact that it reduced their insurance premiums, and it would 
<BR>
be the insurance Dicks and assorted free-lance PIs who would police the 
<BR>
society, trying to catch people doing dangerous research secretly to avoid 
<BR>
premiums.
<BR>
<P>Those people who were caught would doubtless face all kinds of penalty 
<BR>
clauses and vastly increased premiums until their actuarial position 
<BR>
improved.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The Market for Liberty&quot; by Morris and Linda Tannehill is still probably the 
<BR>
single best intro to this kind of view of a utopian future.
<BR>
<P>My own contribution, BTW, which others have doubtless invented 
<BR>
independently, is to consider the idea of an explicit social contract, based 
<BR>
on the legal, transactional incentives provided by the Web, although I 
<BR>
originated the idea in the late '70's.  I believe that this provides the 
<BR>
best overall defense against the forces of tyranny, public or private.
