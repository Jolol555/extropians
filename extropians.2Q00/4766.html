<P>Body Shipped Home Without Vital Organs 
<BR>
<P>LA PAZ, Bolivia (Reuters) - Argentina has been asked to explain why the body of
<BR>
a Bolivian man was returned to his family without his kidneys, corneas, heart or
<BR>
liver,
<BR>
&nbsp;acting Bolivian Foreign Minister Fernando Messmer said on Wednesday. 
<BR>
<P>Miguel Quispe, 22, died in a traffic accident on May 11 in San Salvador de
<BR>
Jujuy,
<BR>
&nbsp;Argentina, some 110 miles south of the Bolivian border. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;An autopsy done on Tuesday in Cochabamba, Bolivia, where the body was
<BR>
returned to Quispe's family, revealed his organs had been removed. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Messmer spoke to reporters after the Assembly for Human Rights announced it
<BR>
plans to file a complaint about Quispe before the Inter-American Commission for
<BR>
Human Rights. 
<BR>
<P>The Bolivian Consulate in San Salvador de Jujuy initially issued a statement
<BR>
saying
<BR>
&nbsp;the organs had been legally removed but later said it had asked for a detailed
<BR>
&nbsp;explanation, Messmer said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Freddy Hurtado, vice president of the Assembly for Human Rights, told
<BR>
reporters he
<BR>
wanted information to prove that Quispe ``was brain dead and was euthanized
<BR>
after
<BR>
&nbsp;being artificially kept alive for the organ harvest'' in Pablo Soria Hospital
<BR>
in San
<BR>
&nbsp;Salvador de Jujuy. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;An Argentine judge who authorized the procedure ``abusively applied a law meant
<BR>
&nbsp;for Argentines to a Bolivian citizen,'' he said.

<P>So folks, watch out what country you get run over in....
