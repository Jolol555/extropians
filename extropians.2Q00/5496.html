<P><EM>&gt; I think the cruiser category is what Spike might be talking about.....I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it's what I'm looking for too.  I looked at a mad cow yesterday.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kawasaki Vulcan it was....they come is several displacements from 500 to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over 1100 cubic whatevers......
</EM><BR>
<P>Centimeters.  That Vulcan has a 1500 cc version too, very cool.
<BR>
Nowthen, several of us are having fun with this, so I guess thats
<BR>
part of what extropian thinking is about, having fun.  {8-]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One variant is the &quot;Drifter&quot; which is seriously retro.  Skirted fenders,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wide comfy seat....long wheelbase (sixy plus inches)......
</EM><BR>
<P>It is an Indian clone, only with a modern massively torquey engine
<BR>
with fuel injection, counterbalancers and reliability, along with actual
<BR>
suspension.  Unlike its Indian predecessor, which was designed to
<BR>
go, not stop, the drifter has real brakes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then there is the Honda Shadow, the Cow (?) Valkarye...
</EM><BR>
<P>The Valkyre is a Honda, horizontally opposed six cylinder,
<BR>
major horsepower, but lacks... charisma.  Or maybe its
<BR>
just me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...people (like me) who years ago used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ride...but got out of it....and now are returning to their origins.....
</EM><BR>
<P>You picked a good time Ev.  Its one hell of a good time for
<BR>
motorcycles right now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Dunno....I'm sure there is some serious policitcal/social/relegiouis/ethical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commentary to be derived from all this...
</EM><BR>
<P>Why do we need political etc commentary?  Bikes are about
<BR>
fun.  If we manage to extend our lives indefinitely and solve
<BR>
many of mankinds most vexing problems, what will be the
<BR>
meaning of life then?  What will we be about?  Having fun!
<BR>
We will be about entertaining each other and good times
<BR>
and trying to make even better times, and stopping war so
<BR>
that still more people and postpeople can enjoy still better
<BR>
times.  This is meaning.  spike
