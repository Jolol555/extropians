<EM>&gt;     &gt; Having two people think the same thing is different then having one
</EM><BR>
person
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; perceive the thoughts of the other person.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, and I can't perceive the thoughts of my copy because there is no
</EM><BR>
other
<BR>
<EM>&gt; person, there is just me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then I think we agree on this point.  We agree on the physics of what is
<BR>
happening.  We just disagree on the termonology of &quot;why&quot; it happens.  You
<BR>
claim that they are thinking the same thoughts because they are &quot;one&quot;
<BR>
person.  I claim that they are thinking the same thoughts because the copy's
<BR>
blank brain just got overwritten with the original's thoughts.
<BR>
<P>This is an argument over terminology, not a disagreement over what is
<BR>
happening.
<BR>
<P>My definition of &quot;one&quot; person is:  single consciousness not about to diverge
<BR>
in thinking, in a single location, connected to all parts of itself.
<BR>
<P>Your definition of &quot;one&quot; person seems to be:  any number of consciousnesses
<BR>
that happen to converge to think identical thoughts at the same time, in
<BR>
serveral locations, disconnected from various parts of itself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;If they thought different things, would one copy perceive the thought
</EM><BR>
from
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;the other through  telepathy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If they thought different things then there must be some difference in
</EM><BR>
their brains so
<BR>
<EM>&gt; they are no longer copies of each other, they're just  twins, or perhaps
</EM><BR>
just brothers.
<BR>
<P>This is my point exactly.  As soon as there are two bodies with two
<BR>
different input streams, they will diverge.  I agree with you that while the
<BR>
input streams are synchronized, they are indistinguishable in quality.  I do
<BR>
not think that they are indistinguishable by location.  I tend to believe
<BR>
that things must come together before they merge into one.  You seem to
<BR>
believe that distant bodies can suddenly merge into one consciousness if
<BR>
they both start thinking the same thoughts.
<BR>
<P>This is all semantics.  It is like arguing whether different movie theatres
<BR>
are showing the same movie or different copies of the same movie.  As long
<BR>
as the shows are identical, the point may be moot semantics.  We pretty much
<BR>
agree that they are the same movie.  If it is possible for them to diverge
<BR>
and have different endings (for example, one has the main character dying,
<BR>
while one has the main character living happily ever after), then I would
<BR>
insist that they were different shows, even if they started off the same.
<BR>
<P>Does the happy ending of one movie somehow &quot;save&quot; the character from the
<BR>
other movie?  This is a semantic question depending on terminology.  We all
<BR>
agree on what happens in the shows, but we may us different terminology to
<BR>
characterize it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; The very fact that they diverge seems to indicate that one
</EM><BR>
consciousness is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; not controlling both.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why? They diverged because something external happened to one and not the
</EM><BR>
other.
<BR>
<P>I argue that the only way that something can happen to one and not the other
<BR>
is if they are two separate entities in the first place.  If there were only
<BR>
one entity, it would experience whatever happened to itself.  The only way
<BR>
one could experience something that the other doesn't is if the one and the
<BR>
other are not the same entity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;All the proposed mechanisms (except one) that attempt to
</EM><BR>
identify the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;cause of  this huge change, like something special about my
</EM><BR>
atoms or
<BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;something special about my position have been shown to be
</EM><BR>
invalid,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;&quot;the original&quot; and &quot;the copy&quot; are not well defined concepts nor
</EM><BR>
can they
<BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;be used as distinct categories without  inconsistencies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;and the vague psycho-babble explanations for all this are so bad
</EM><BR>
they're
<BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;not even wrong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; I don't know what change you are referencing here.  What changed?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;From what  to what?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think anything changed but you think a change of cosmic
</EM><BR>
proportions
<BR>
<EM>&gt; has happened, something has changed you into something not you. If true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then this force or law or whatever you want to call it is the most
</EM><BR>
important
<BR>
<EM>&gt; thing in the universe.  Every variable in it should be examined to try to
</EM><BR>
figure
<BR>
<EM>&gt; out how this thing works.
</EM><BR>
<P>The only change I see is that the two copies diverge.  Being in different
<BR>
bodies, they naturally experience different sensory inputs.  They walk their
<BR>
separate ways and become two unrelated people.  If you define both bodies as
<BR>
&quot;me&quot;, and then they diverge so that they are different, then I can see where
<BR>
you would describe this cosmic change from &quot;me&quot; to &quot;not me&quot;.  I would have
<BR>
thought that in your viewpoint, the one &quot;me&quot; would diverge to become &quot;two
<BR>
different me's&quot;.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EXACTLY what force (or what something) caused this profound change?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why can't science detect it? Does this same mystical force of yours
</EM><BR>
operate
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in the real world, even if at a lesser intensity than in my thought
</EM><BR>
experiment?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; How many atoms in your body can I change before this force kicks in and
</EM><BR>
you're
<BR>
<EM>&gt; no longer the original ? How fast can I change them? How can atoms give us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individuality when they have no individuality themselves?  EXACTLY how
</EM><BR>
strong
<BR>
<EM>&gt; does this force have to be until you are no longer you and just become
</EM><BR>
something
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that looks and acts and thinks and feels like you? Why isn't that enough
</EM><BR>
for it to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be you? Is identity or survival really a all or nothing thing? One last
</EM><BR>
question,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is there one particle of evidence that this amazing force even exists?
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not believe in this mystical force.  You are the one who claims that
<BR>
making a second brain think the same thoughts as me suddenly makes it me.
<BR>
It is by your definition that the diverging copies suddenly change into &quot;not
<BR>
me&quot;.  Since I don't agree with your definitions, I don't agree with your
<BR>
conclusions, therefore I have nothing to explain.  It is only by your
<BR>
definition that changing from &quot;me&quot; to &quot;not me&quot; is a cosmic change.  I do not
<BR>
agree that with your definitions, so I see no problem.  I believe you have
<BR>
created a new copy that is not me.  Later as we diverge, the copy still is
<BR>
not me.  No such problem occurs from my position.  You only perceive a
<BR>
problem from your position.
<BR>
<P>Again, I think this is a word-problem of semantics, not physics.  You are
<BR>
breaking the laws of logic (perhaps), but not the laws of physics with these
<BR>
examples.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;I don't claim that the copies  can tell which is the &quot;original&quot; and
</EM><BR>
which is the &quot;copy&quot;.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree. You could be a copy right now yet you would still feel the same
</EM><BR>
way, you still
<BR>
<EM>&gt; feel a sense of continuity. A copy of a copy could be made and still
</EM><BR>
nothing important
<BR>
<EM>&gt; would change.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If I made a billion copies a second and destroyed a billion copies a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second from the day you were born there would be no change in the
</EM><BR>
subjective
<BR>
<EM>&gt; feelings you experience at this very instant because as you say, you can't
</EM><BR>
tell if
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you're a copy or the original, in fact the entire concept of &quot;the
</EM><BR>
original&quot; is meaningless
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in this case.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here you have added the concept of destroying copies of me.  I don't mind
<BR>
copies being created, but please don't destroy them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You would say that many trillions of Harvey Newstroms have died
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tragically, but you're still conscious, you still have emotions, you still
</EM><BR>
have memories
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and you still have a feeling of continuity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  The killed copies have died.  The last remaining copy is still alive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For the life of me I don't understand what  has been lost.
</EM><BR>
<P>The original Harvey Newstrom has been lost.  A brain that was thinking
<BR>
thoughts and would have kept thinking thoughts if left alone has suddenly
<BR>
been forced to stop thinking thoughts.  This is my definition of death.
<BR>
<P>For the life of me, I can't figure out how making a copy of me gives you the
<BR>
right to kill me.  After you make a copy, there are now two living beings
<BR>
that act alike and answer to the name &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot;.  What in the world
<BR>
makes it OK to kill a living sentient being?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;I claim that each  copy can tell which is &quot;their&quot; body or
</EM><BR>
consciousness
<BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;and which is the  &quot;other&quot; body and consciousness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ESP?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  They tell the same way you know that you are in your body and not in
<BR>
mine.  Your sensory perceptions are coming through your body.  Your
<BR>
movements only affect your body.  Do you really have no way to know what
<BR>
body your consciousness resides in?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;Your claim that the copy and the original are &quot;one&quot; is semi-mystical
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;semi-unscientific.  It implies thought communication between
</EM><BR>
disconnected
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;brains with no  scientific rationale.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a red tomato in my right hand and a red apple in my left hand, but
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; don't think the tomato is communicating with the apple telling it how to
</EM><BR>
be red.
<BR>
<P>But you are not claiming that the tomato is the apple.  Bad analogy.  Give
<BR>
me an anology where you claim that the objects in either hand are the same
<BR>
object, even if they are not touching or communicating.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I grant you that some of my thought experiments are a little far out but
</EM><BR>
that's
<BR>
<EM>&gt; what you do when you test theories, you push them to extremes to see if
</EM><BR>
they'll
<BR>
<EM>&gt; crack. Yours does.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is what I don't understand.  What theory of mine are you testing?  I
<BR>
disagree with your labels and your goals.  I do not disagree with any
<BR>
examples that your have described.  What exactly is it that you are trying
<BR>
to disprove?  Can you &quot;disprove&quot; the fact that I don't want my copies
<BR>
killed?  Can you &quot;prove&quot; the fact that they &quot;could be&quot; killed?
