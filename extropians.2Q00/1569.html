<P>
I saw a pointer on slashdot yesterday to this article at EE Times:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.eet.com/story/OEG20000421S0024">http://www.eet.com/story/OEG20000421S0024</A>.  It discusses some of the
<BR>
issues relating to future progress in miniaturization of electronic
<BR>
circuitry.
<BR>
<P>According to the chart, chips are currently being made with feature sizes
<BR>
as small as .18 microns.  This is 180 nanometers for what they call a
<BR>
&quot;node&quot;, of which the &quot;gate&quot; is 140 nm.  (Unfortunately I have only a
<BR>
sketchy understanding of the geometry of silicon devices.)
<BR>
<P>The interesting thing is that the transistors rely on a thin resisting
<BR>
layer of silicon dioxide, and that is only about 23 angstroms wide,
<BR>
or 2.3 nm.  Atoms themselves are about 2 angstroms in diameter so these
<BR>
resistive layers are already only about 10 atoms thick.
<BR>
<P>They want to begin moving to feature sizes of 70 nm (.07 micron), which
<BR>
requires SiO2 layers only 15 angstroms thick or less.  The article is
<BR>
about how it is now thought that such thin films will be more stable
<BR>
than had been feared.  Previously, workers were concerned that films
<BR>
thinner than now in use would be damaged by electron flow and get holes,
<BR>
making the lifetime of the parts too low to be useful.  New work suggests
<BR>
that this problem is not so severe.
<BR>
<P>The article doesn't say so, but I think the problem is that this
<BR>
insulating layer has to withstand the voltage used by the chip.  This is
<BR>
now getting down to just over a volt, but across 15 angstroms that is
<BR>
about a billion volts per meter.  Imagine a million volt difference
<BR>
across a millimeter, and you can see that sparks will fly.
<BR>
<P>Once they get to the point where SiO2 will break down, they need to
<BR>
go to a different insulator: zirconium, hafnium or titanium oxides.
<BR>
I don't know if the semiconductors themselves would still be made of
<BR>
silicon or whether this would imply going to a whole new chip substrate.
<BR>
In any case the industry is reluctant to take that step because of their
<BR>
30 year track record with SiO2.
<BR>
<P>The other interesting thing about the article was their long term
<BR>
projection for shrinking feature size.  It shows a decrease from 180 to
<BR>
25 nm over 18 years, a factor of 7.2.  If density is proportional to the
<BR>
square of the feature size, that would be a density increase of 52, about
<BR>
6 doublings.  6 doublings in 18 years is one doubling every three years.
<BR>
That would represent a halving of the traditional rate of increase of
<BR>
Moore's Law, which has been quoted as a doubling of density every 1.5
<BR>
years (actually variants using 1 and 2 years also exist).
<BR>
<P>So it appears that the industry does have a road map for at least
<BR>
approximately maintaining Moore's Law over the next 20 years, without
<BR>
going to any exotic technology like nanotech.  There are many problems
<BR>
which must be solved to achieve these gains, but it appears that in
<BR>
principle it can be done.
