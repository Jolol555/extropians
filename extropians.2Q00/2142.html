<EM>&gt; Regarding controversial topics, there was a show on Discovery regarding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance camera tech.  It was in the most libertarian, low tax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state in the U.S., Nevada, in the casinos.  Im surprised none of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us thought of it:  its perfect.  With buttloads of untraceable money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floating around all over the place and being a thief magnet as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as a strange attractor for every amateur card shark and trickster,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the casinos have every reason to buy all the latest and greatest high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tech surveillance gear, face recognition software, rooms filled floor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to ceiling with banks of whirring VCRs recording every wink and twitch.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And best of all, it has no Orwell angle: its all voluntary.  No one forces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone to go into a casino.  They had some wicked cool stuff there.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>While I am a strong privacy advocate (and a Nevada resident), I have no
<BR>
issues with the casinos employing state-of-the-art surveillance as part of
<BR>
their business.  It is in the interest of both the casinos and the
<BR>
consumer that the gaming environment be run as &quot;straight&quot; as is feasibly
<BR>
possible from the perspective of the house and the player.  The casinos
<BR>
spend extraordinary quantities of money policing themselves because it is a
<BR>
competitive market and far cheaper than having the government become
<BR>
involved.  I don't fear the casinos because I know that they are run by
<BR>
competent businessmen with rational self-interest and that the only
<BR>
authority they must generally answer to is the state.  It is interesting
<BR>
to note that Native American casinos, which usually operate as a government
<BR>
granted monopoly, have a much poorer track record than the more-or-less
<BR>
free market gambling operations that operate in places like Nevada.
<BR>
<P>It should also be noted that Nevada has very strict privacy
<BR>
laws that are actually fairly &quot;anti-big brother&quot;.  It is generally known
<BR>
that the State of Nevada will not disclose many of the records it collects
<BR>
to the Federal government, and Federal regulatory agencies in particular
<BR>
(such as the IRS).  Since federal regulatory agencies do not have any
<BR>
particular constitutional authority to demand such access, this is often
<BR>
used as a roadblock to keep things out of Federal hands (you see signs
<BR>
on buildings here that state that federal agents must have a
<BR>
detailed federal warrant AND be accompanied by the local sheriff or their
<BR>
requests will not be honored).  Nickel-and-dime regulation and tax
<BR>
enforcement is far less prevalent than it is in places like California
<BR>
largely because government micro-management is strongly discouraged.
<BR>
<P>I am technically a resident of Nevada (although I spend most of my time in
<BR>
Silicon Valley) and I have grown to really appreciate the state.  The
<BR>
reason I like Nevada so much is that just about everything in the state is
<BR>
voluntary and generally permissible.  It is generally understood by the
<BR>
native population that life is cheaper and better if the government only
<BR>
gets involved as a last resort.  As a result businesses and individuals
<BR>
actively police their own affairs, largely eliminating the need for
<BR>
regulation and oversight.  
<BR>
<P>People who live in &quot;free&quot; places like California are often shocked when
<BR>
they find out how free places like Nevada actually are -- it makes them
<BR>
look like they live in a minor police state by comparison.  I have
<BR>
generally found, and truly believe, that it is nearly impossible for a
<BR>
person to conceptualize freedom beyond their personal experience. 
<BR>
Most people find massive expansions of freedom to be scary; I find it to
<BR>
be addictive.
