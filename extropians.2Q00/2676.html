<EM>&gt; &gt; Granted, they do make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  reading more pleasurable, but they can also lull one into agreement
</EM><BR>
merely
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  because the author seems pleasant, witty, and an all around nice

person.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually he seems quite a disagreeable man. I simply don't disagree with
</EM><BR>
his
<BR>
<EM>&gt; politics as much you do.
</EM><BR>
<P>But the point was not his politics as such or even my disagreement with
<BR>
them, but whether they influenced the rest of his thinking.  I contend they
<BR>
do.  (You (plural) might have noticed, I've very thin skin when in comes to
<BR>
biology.:)
<BR>
<P>Also, in his _The Mismeasure of Man_, I think his goal is quite clear: to
<BR>
blacken the notion of general intelligence so badly as to make it completely
<BR>
unpalatable.  This he does not only by direct assault -- which, by the way,
<BR>
he fails at -- but also by juxtaposing it with phrenology and the like.
<BR>
I.e., he tries to associate what he does not like but might have some
<BR>
credence with what is generally thought to be ridiculous.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
