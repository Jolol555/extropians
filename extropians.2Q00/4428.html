<EM>&gt; buzz-terms....other trends and developments I'm overlooking.  Comments?

<P>The real underlying problem is we are using our cars as a
<BR>
rolling refuge from the unpleasantries of modern living.  It
<BR>
is a metal and glass shield, a wonderfully comfortable and
<BR>
fully controllable mobile castle, a relaxing escape haven.
<BR>
<P>People may *say* that they live two hours out from work because
<BR>
of the oppressive Silicon Valley real estate prices, but the fact
<BR>
is, their cars provide four hours of freedom from the shrieking
<BR>
and wingeing of their oversized brood of larvae, the complaints
<BR>
of a dissatisfied spouse, the cares of everyday living.
<BR>
<P>Solutions: 1)  build skyscrapers on all existing parking lots.  New York
<BR>
and Boston have been experimenting with this, to great advantage.
<BR>
<P>2)  Inject into all new cars a compound that combines with the freon
<BR>
in air condition systems to render them useless and unrepairable
<BR>
after a few months.
<BR>
<P>3)  Jam all FM and AM radio frequencies with a random jumble
<BR>
of hideously cacophonic but strangely rythmic racket, made by
<BR>
entertainers with names that sound like Vanilla Shake, and Ice Tray.
<BR>
This too is being tried in several major metropoli.
<BR>
<P>4) Convert all freeways from the current three packed normal lanes
<BR>
and one empty carpool lane to one packed normal lane and three
<BR>
empty carpool lanes.
<BR>
<P>5)  Use another compound (to which I am seeking a patent) that
<BR>
causes the foam in carseats to harden to the consistency of wood.
<BR>
<P>With these simple steps, soon urban sprawlers will give up the
<BR>
pleasures of long commutes, since it will become a sweating, boring,
<BR>
cacophanous, wooden-bench-sitting-uncomfortable, knowing-there's-
<BR>
no-place-to-park experience that will soon lead to wonderful
<BR>
breakthrus in telecommuting technology, in bee-hive borganism super
<BR>
compact living styles, ever so much preferrable to our present
<BR>
urban sprawl.  Even Al Gore will be pleased with such a
<BR>
solution.  spike
