<EM>&gt; I would like to discuss the following three types of personalities:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; followers, leaders, and independent thinkers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At some point in the future, people will have the ability to engineer the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personalities of members of the succeeding generations.  If you were, say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creating the members of an expedition that would colonize a new planet, how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would you handle the independent thinking vs. &quot;true believer&quot; trait?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would it be better to have a group of independent thinkers (who could, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example, figure out how to best utilize the resources of the new planet), or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would it be better to have just one or two independent thinkers and the rest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; followers and leaders (presumably only a couple of leaders and the rest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; followers)?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's an interesting point, but I would look at it from a slightly
<BR>
different perspective, as a question of how we coordinate the various
<BR>
activities involved in the project.
<BR>
<P>The independent-thinker model is relatively decentralized.  How would they
<BR>
coordinate?  They might need to set up some kind of market relationship
<BR>
with an economy and prices so that the preferences of all are exposed and
<BR>
the most effective use of resources can be found.
<BR>
<P>The leader-follower model leads to a hierarchical system, with information
<BR>
flowing up and commands flowing down.
<BR>
<P>In our world we tend to see hierarchical systems used for relatively
<BR>
small scale activities like business firms, while decentralized systems
<BR>
are used at the larger scale.
<BR>
<P>It's possible that with future technologies, the relative advantages of
<BR>
one or the other system will shift.
<BR>
<P>In the longer run, I suspect that individuals will become hierarchical,
<BR>
with many subsystems and sub-selves which all work together to accomplish
<BR>
the individual's goals.  There will be a blurring of the lines between
<BR>
a set of separate entities working closely in a collective endeavor,
<BR>
and a single entity who has many parts working together.
<BR>
<P>There may also be more loosely structured collectives which have some
<BR>
of the properties of separate individuals but can also be thought of as
<BR>
a single person.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In nomadic tribal cultures leaders generally have the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; material possessions as followers and do the same sorts of work as far as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gathering and hunting food.  Thus, there would be less reason for a follower
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to resent his or her role as follower than in a more complex culture where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the leader has a better house, better clothes, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>In my generalizations of these concepts, I wouldn't assume that a leader
<BR>
would necessarily have better goods than the others.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the hypothetical planet colonizing expedition, would the people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineered to be followers resent the sort of roles they'd been genetically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assigned to?
</EM><BR>
<P>This is an empirical question which would depend on the details of their
<BR>
mental structure.  It could go either way depending on how much control the
<BR>
genetic engineers had and what their goals are.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In a civilization rich with the fruits of nanotechnology, would leaders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enjoy any special privileges? If the option existed for a person who had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been born and educated to be a follower to be re-engineered into a leader,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would many followers choose this option? What of independent thinkers?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would they want to change?  Would followers and/or leaders have any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incentive to become independent thinkers?
</EM><BR>
<P>Just as we have a system today where hierarchically structured firms
<BR>
compete on an equal footing in a marketplace, we may continue to have
<BR>
a mix of leader/follower and independent roles for individuals in
<BR>
the future.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To what extent do people living at this very moment have the ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change from followers to independent thinkers?  How about the other way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around?  From independent thinkers to followers? What incentives are there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to change from one to the other?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think one is inherently better than the other.  I explicitly
<BR>
reject the simplistic moral view that says that independence is better
<BR>
than taking on a supporting role in a larger organizational structure.
<BR>
<P>Both forms of social organizations are tools.  The tool must fit the job.
<BR>
Which one is best will depend on circumstances.
<BR>
<P>Hal
