<P>&lt;&lt; Exactly - it's like thinking you could emulate a P2 on a P2 and end up with
<BR>
&nbsp;something faster. The implication therefore is that you can't model the whole
<BR>
&nbsp;universe in anything smaller than the whole universe, which is why I don't
<BR>
&nbsp;understand why someone would claim you could simulate everything with a star.
<BR>
&nbsp;Given the constraint of perfect fidelity (if indeed that means anything), 
<BR>
then
<BR>
&nbsp;which paradigm you work in is just a bookkeeping issue.

My guess is that to emulate the cosmos, one need not simulate itself, entire; 
<BR>
but merely the effects to varied observers.  Gravity need only to behave as 
<BR>
if it is one G, to 6-10 billion of earth's inhabitants(proggies); and not 
<BR>
actually manifest itself physically. Closer to last year's movie The 13th 
<BR>
Floor.  Or  as the expert said; Heck I dunno.
