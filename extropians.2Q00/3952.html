<EM>&gt;  &gt;Am I mistaken in thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;that one aspect of art is communication?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  No, I don't think so.  My work as an artist is to communicate ideas and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  feelings, reflections, concerns and joys.

<P>Natasha, 
<BR>
That was a beautiful post. It almost brought a tear to my eye to see art 
<BR>
discussed in such a well educated way, but also it explained on a level that 
<BR>
anyone can clearly understand. You are a kind person, and a generous one, to 
<BR>
take the time to tell that personal and touching vignette  about your dad - 
<BR>
which so eloquently clarifies this thread so sensitively and concisely,
<BR>
<P>I think what Rand -- and many others who do not like Pollock -- were 
<BR>
concerned with was &quot;drawing ability&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>Much of art is a learned language. It is a mysterious one to those whodon't 
<BR>
have the time (or interest) to educate themselves in the history and delights 
<BR>
of the discipline. Many people find that quite unnecessary, but still feel 
<BR>
qualified to speak on the virtues or foibles of abstract art. As well, to 
<BR>
find meaning in much of the work described as expressionistic or abstract, to 
<BR>
find meaning, one must also search the landscape of their own mind for the 
<BR>
significance of expression. 
<BR>
<P>This does not sit well with those who like things to be immediately clear, 
<BR>
without having to risk. It does not sit well with people who need to have 
<BR>
things &quot;proved in black and white&quot; - which Pollock's work quite clearly is 
<BR>
not about. He was proving something, but you REALLY did have to look outside 
<BR>
the box. Frank Lloyd Wright was another genius who made people do that, and 
<BR>
for some reason Rand idolized him ... go figure.
<BR>
<P>What comes to mind for me is the notion that most teachers I work with (I 
<BR>
educate educators about art) that art is &quot;drawing.&quot; And they say they &quot;are 
<BR>
not good at art&quot; By that they mean they lack a certain ability to make images 
<BR>
of real objects.
<BR>
<P>It takes weeks, sometimes months, to get them to stop referring to &quot;drawing&quot; 
<BR>
when talking about art. After teaching them about line, color, form, 
<BR>
vocabulary, viewing, composition, expression, genres, etc. -- something 
<BR>
happens and they see art as a larger picture (no pun intended ; ). They begin 
<BR>
to take pride in their knowledge and judgment abilities and a whole new world 
<BR>
opens up to them. It is delightful to see.
