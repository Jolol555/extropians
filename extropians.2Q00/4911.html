<P>
Martin, I'd be interested to learn more of the use you make of your
<BR>
journals.
<BR>
<P>Here's one way I use meditation in conjunction with memories of past events.
<BR>
I've found that there are certain moments in my life that stand out from the
<BR>
others in that they're brighter and seem to have been experienced from a
<BR>
state of mind that I'll call transcendant for want of a better word.  (I
<BR>
feel as though I must step carefully here to avoid being misinterpreted as
<BR>
referring to something supernatural. Unfortunately, our language doesn't
<BR>
contain words that exactly fit the things I'm trying to describe).  The
<BR>
characteristics of this state of mind include a feeling of timelessness, or
<BR>
being outside of time; profound peace of mind; invulnerability; and great
<BR>
beauty of an indescirbable sort--a beauty that might include, for example,
<BR>
the &quot;seeing&quot; of radiation above and below the usual range of visible light.
<BR>
If I sit quietly and let go of my present concerns, I can access these
<BR>
isolated moments which occurred at different times of my life.  The earliest
<BR>
I can remember took place when I was a small child in Philadelphia (I would
<BR>
have been around a year old, I guess).  There was an alley behind our house,
<BR>
and in the summer the dust in the alley would sparkle in the sunlight.  Just
<BR>
that.  Looking at the dust sparkling in the sunlight. The next I can
<BR>
remember took place in Houston when I must have been around 4.  Standing in
<BR>
the front yard of our house on a sunny day, listening to the engines of a
<BR>
DC3 flying overhead.  I didn't know at the time that it was a DC3, but
<BR>
whenever I hear one now, I'm taken back to that moment.  And so forth.
<BR>
<P>If I take some time each day, maybe only a couple of minutes here and there,
<BR>
I find that I experience a qualitative difference in the way I perceive the
<BR>
present context of my life.  I'm able to find solutions to problems that
<BR>
seemed before to be impossible obstacles.  I'm able to grasp relationships
<BR>
between objects that I couldn't grasp before, to see the way different
<BR>
elements of an ecosystem work together, for example. And, one of the most
<BR>
interesting aspects of this technique, people seem different to me: more
<BR>
accessible, more friendly, more beautifully complex and worthy of respect.
<BR>
<P>When I begin to feel frustrated or depressed, if I take a moment at the
<BR>
onset of the unpleasant feelings to access these brighter states of mind, I
<BR>
can often pull myself out of these feelings of anger, hopelessness, or
<BR>
whatever non-constructive state of mind I happen to be slipping into. I'm
<BR>
not implying here that I ignore real problems or obstacles.  I'm saying
<BR>
rather that I shift my pov so that I begin to look for opportunities
<BR>
associated with the thing or event I was thinking of before as a hopeless
<BR>
obstacle.
<BR>
<P>Bonnie

<EM>&gt; Perhaps this is a prosaic suggestion to something more imaginative

<EM>&gt; that you might have been holding in your mind, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about recording ourselves using the suggestion I said some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weeks back? (Answering &quot;What does it feel like to be ME?&quot; at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regular intervals.) It conects backwards, but one can always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make committments to future selves at the same time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a way to see our own tracks through our own life-forest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Looking at one's life-tracks can be enlightening. It also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shows how the sum of every experience makes us who we are today.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the exact reason I keep a diary. For those who do not, I cannot
<BR>
recommend anything more highly. A month of life in which you have recorded
<BR>
your thoughts and the things which have concerned and affected you can
<BR>
be worth an entire year which you went through without, in my opinion.
<BR>
<P>Even after just a short while, you begin to become more aware of the
<BR>
processes which shape you. You can probabably consider major events and
<BR>
changes in your life, and look at the different ways you thought about
<BR>
things - but I guaruntee you would be amazed to look back over some of
<BR>
the inbetween steps you may have forgotten.
<BR>
<P>Coupled with meditation (the two usually overlapping), it has brought me
<BR>
an incredible insight into not just myself, but others also. I'm
<BR>
surprised it didn't occur to me to mention here earlier, in fact.
<BR>
<P>I'd love to discuss this with others, and would be happy to share some
<BR>
advice on what I've found the best way to go about doing this.
