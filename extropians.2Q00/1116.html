<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I don't, however, feel cold hearted about execution. Anyone who has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  demonstrated no respect for their fellow man is no longer human.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>You are joining in a self deception that is a dangerous argument; useful when 
<BR>
you are called upon to murder. When you enter into this terrain you join a 
<BR>
charade that has been in place for centuries. Calling humans non-human is a 
<BR>
convenient lie, a fairy tale in order to treat them inhumanly. Richard 
<BR>
Ramirez no doubt deserves, really deserves to be treated like animal. But it 
<BR>
is not because he really *is* an animal, it is because he is evil.  We have 
<BR>
decided to treat him like one -- out of an abhorrence for what he does -- and 
<BR>
to guarantee our own safety. 
<BR>
<P>He is in a cell alone, no bed, no furniture, only himself on the floor, in 
<BR>
his underwear. And there he shall stay until perhaps one day he is murdered 
<BR>
by us. 
<BR>
<P>Not all murderers are inhuman. I know it. I work with them. We make art 
<BR>
together.
<BR>
<P>When Gangbangers are killing people they do not think about them as human, 
<BR>
there's even a non-human term for the innocent bystander &quot;mushrooms&quot; -- 
<BR>
because they &quot;just pop up.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;One of the favorite things they draw are masks. 
<BR>
<P>Why masks, I ask them? 
<BR>
Just like the Nazi doctors at Nuremberg, masks are donned, horrible things 
<BR>
are done, and they go back to being (rather sweet) humans. They still have 
<BR>
feelings, girlfriends and moms they love, and considerable talents and 
<BR>
sensitivities. 
<BR>
<P><P>This mask is a necessary part of doing evil. It is the same sort of trick 
<BR>
that 'deciding someone is no longer human.&quot; Self deception. Be careful, this 
<BR>
is the stuff religions are made of.
<BR>
<P>This line of thinking is that is how the Nazi's got people to slaughter those 
<BR>
Jewish &quot;animals&quot;. Happens in war too.
<BR>
<P>Neurobiologists: what kind of humans were at Nuremberg when they executed 
<BR>
millions and went home to play beautiful piano concertos. Is this ability to 
<BR>
dehumanize others not a &quot;part' of being human?
