<P>You may be right Anders, but I can see a way around this particular
<BR>
argument.  If male sex drive decreases during a long-winter induced
<BR>
depression, then presumably it would result in fewer October babies.
<BR>
Perhaps this would compensate for the otherwise higher number of
<BR>
October babies caused by increased face time by mates in January
<BR>
and February.  Presumably an April or May baby in the far north
<BR>
would have a higher probability of survival?
<BR>
<P>The argument then would be ancient populations were much more
<BR>
limited by food shortages than by lack of sexual activity.
<BR>
<P>I have only myself to experiment upon, but I find it interesting that
<BR>
my own appetite decreases noticeably in the darkest months.  I
<BR>
could see where this would create a survival advantage in those
<BR>
populations that had this feature, if they lived in the far northern
<BR>
latitudes.  Someone here has said evolution does not work at
<BR>
this level but still I cannot understand why not.  spike
