<EM>&gt; &gt; Do we really have a civil right to privacy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The US constitutional &quot;right to privacy&quot; is said to be &quot;penumbral&quot;, i.e. it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is inferred from (or &quot;found in the shadows of&quot;) other, more explicit rights,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such as the 1st (free expression), 4th (freedom from unreasonable search and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seizure) and 5th and 14th (freedom from self-incrimination and right to due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process) amendments in the Bill of Rights.  Thus constitutional rights to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privacy tend to be much more a matter of decisional common law than in some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other areas.
</EM><BR>
<P>But only in that most courts today seem to have total ignorance or
<BR>
distain for the 9th Amendment, and are drifting away from the founders
<BR>
concepts of Natural Law. Under the 9th, any rights not enumerated in the
<BR>
Constitution are retained by the people, as individuals, so it follows
<BR>
that since privacy is not explicitly mentioned, it is a 9th Amendment
<BR>
right.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I know we have always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  assumed that we do, but suppose I have one of those cool airplane
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  thingies with the 18 gram camera in it, 15 cm wingspan, 75 gram
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  total.  I fly it over your house and for some reason I like to gawk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  at you.  Have I actually broken any laws?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't believe one has &quot;positive&quot; rights to the airspace above one's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property, but rather &quot;negative&quot; rights arising from ownership of land.  Thus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one has the right to be free from the nuisance, for instance, that might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; created by low-flying aircraft.  In any kind of normal case, one certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't have the right to keep someone from looking at you.  This makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;paparazzi&quot; cases difficult for celebrities.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, anyone on your neighbors property, or on public property contiguous
<BR>
to your own has a right to view what they can of your property and any
<BR>
goings on as a consequence of their own rights to enjoy their property.
<BR>
This also applies in reverse where you get nuisances: If I'm doing
<BR>
something on my property that is in plain veiw of or within hearing
<BR>
distance of your property, which you judge to impact on your peace,
<BR>
comfort, repose, and general usage of your property (including the
<BR>
market value of your property), you have grounds for a tort on that
<BR>
basis.
<BR>
<P>Paparazzi hanging outside your property, or flying over your property,
<BR>
could be construed as creating a nuisance and impacting your enjoyment
<BR>
of your property.
<BR>
<P>However, if you take measures on your own property to limit the ability
<BR>
of others on contiguous property to view your property or hear the
<BR>
goings on there, and those measures reside totally on your property,
<BR>
like, say, a 12' wall around the perimeter of your property, just within
<BR>
the property line,  then outside parties cannot climb that wall (since
<BR>
its on your property, so thats trespassing). The problem is in
<BR>
constructing your barrier so as to eliminate as many, if not all,
<BR>
potential angles of view. Dome over your property with a one-way
<BR>
transparency would definitely eliminate the potential for observation,
<BR>
though I'm not sure how well 'one way mirrors' work when you are dealing
<BR>
with IR frequencies.
