<P>
The question nobody wants to answer clearly because is would just sound
<BR>
too stupid is this:
<BR>
<P>Question: I've been making and destroying a billion Harvey Newstroms
<BR>
every second since you were a one celled zygote, so who is the original
<BR>
Harvey Newstrom?
<BR>
<P>Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lee@piclab.com?Subject=Re:%20Is%20the%20fourth%20%20time%20is%20the%20charm?&In-Reply-To=&lt;006001bfc151$8bd88d80$1ab74d0c@flrjs&gt;">lee@piclab.com</A>&gt; says this:
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;OK, then: an &quot;original&quot; is that instance of a thing which existed at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;point in time at which the process of &quot;copying&quot; commenced, where &quot;copying&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;is understood as the process of creating another instance of a thing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;shares as many properties with the existing thing as physically possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>A keen grasp of the obvious. I've given up trying to getting a straight answer from
<BR>
Harvey but I've only asked you twice so perhaps there is still some slight hope; in the
<BR>
example I have given who is the original Harvey Newstrom? I don't want to hear
<BR>
&quot;In general the original is [...], don't want any more useless generalities and vapid
<BR>
definitions, I want a clear unambiguous statement about this specific example.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I know why you've been hesitating and maybe I'm a little sadistic for pushing
<BR>
&nbsp;so hard but I want to see if you can really say with a straight face that the only
<BR>
&nbsp;true original is that one celled zygote.
<BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;&gt; Harvey Newstrom needs no such definition [of self], he has something much much
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;&gt; better, an example. Definitions are seldom important in life and certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;&gt; not in this case.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; But he doesn't have an example
</EM><BR>
<P>All human beings who are not in a coma have a sense of identity,  the reason we
<BR>
fear death is we fear it will be lost and it's the only part of us that's important. I know
<BR>
of no good definition of &quot;the self&quot; but I know of a real good example and I know this
<BR>
has nothing to do with atoms, people felt this way long before they even suspected
<BR>
atoms existed. I might add that my thought experiment is not really that far fetched,
<BR>
every second trillions of atoms leave out body and trillions more take their place.
<BR>
