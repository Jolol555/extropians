<P>
I’ve recently grown obsessed again with the requirements of
<BR>
accurately simulating the neurons role in *informational*
<BR>
processing.  We do know that a majority of a neurons
<BR>
function is devoted to repair and self maintenance.
<BR>
However, the question of how much of a neurons function is
<BR>
directly related to cognitive processing remains in dispute.
<BR>
<P>If you ask Hans Moravec he remains content is equating each
<BR>
neuron with a single transistor.  He bases this claim on his
<BR>
analysis of the ocular neurons role in visual processing.
<BR>
The problem with this assumption is that the simple
<BR>
processing of visual data near the ocular region neglects
<BR>
the remaining processing that’s required to assess the
<BR>
context and meaning of that data and integrating it within
<BR>
the larger realm of cognitive life itself, to say nothing of
<BR>
emotional or other more subtle psychological states.
<BR>
<P>My assertion is that the computation required within each
<BR>
neuron is far greater than can be met by a single
<BR>
transistor.  A typical neuron has several thousand synapses
<BR>
connected to other neurons mediated by a complex array of
<BR>
neurotransmitter activity. Each neuron is responsible for
<BR>
regulating the transmission and reception of signals along
<BR>
these networks. Although synaptic transmission is quantal
<BR>
because an integer number of vesicles must fuse to release
<BR>
their neurotransmitters, the decision when to fire is
<BR>
determined ultimately by the degree and types of
<BR>
neurotransmitters involved.  This is why various types of
<BR>
psychoactive drugs from Prozac to Marijuana have remarkably
<BR>
different effects on cognition and mood.
<BR>
<P>**My contention then, is that although the pattern of the
<BR>
neural network determines in part who and what we are, the
<BR>
complex neurotransmitter activity within the neurons
<BR>
themselves also play a significant role in the quality of
<BR>
our subjective states.  Therefore there is no way a single
<BR>
transistor has a chance of duplicating.
<BR>
<P>So the question remains what amount of computational
<BR>
machinery is required to replace the current role that a
<BR>
neuron plays?  Any takers?
