<P>If that has been &quot;demonstrated&quot; it is a theoretical

result unconfirmed by experimental data.  I know of
<BR>
nothing that has settled the composition of the

universe definitively one way or another.
<BR>
<P>The astronomers at the gravitational microlensing
<BR>
conference in South Africa in Feb. voted out
<BR>
highly inconclusively (something like 50%:30%:27%:2%)
<BR>
on what the cause of their observations is.  If
<BR>
they can't figure out whether or not what they
<BR>
are seeing is black holes, brown dwarfs &amp; gas cloud
<BR>
clusters, or anomolies in the shapes of galaxies,
<BR>
then I would say conclusions such as you cite above
<BR>
are tentative at best.
<BR>
<P>If you have any references for this claim I would enjoy
<BR>
looking at them.
