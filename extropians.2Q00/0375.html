Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>The exciting discussion about creating a resort with a cryonics community 
<BR>
around it is continuing on Cryonet.  For those of you without Cryonet 
<BR>
subscriptions here is more promising news about the project.  There is a 
<BR>
plot of land nearby that is up for sale.  Perhaps, extropians should 
<BR>
purchase it and be the good neighbors next door! ;)
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg

<P>Reply to several persons
<BR>
From:  Dave pizer
<BR>
<P>Thanks for all the direct and public response.  During the next 12 months we 
<BR>
welcome as much input as possible.  Venturist co-founder, Mike Perry, and I 
<BR>
and the Venturist Board want to learn as much as possible about what the 
<BR>
cryonics community wants before we start construction.  We want to create a 
<BR>
facility that *you* will want to visit often and you will *want*to retire to 
<BR>
someday.  A place that you can visit or live in where you can help promote 
<BR>
your and our common views to the rest of the world through many different 
<BR>
ways.
<BR>
We want to create a facility that will be successful in promoting the
<BR>
cryonics/immortality philosophy to the rest of the world.  We *need* your 
<BR>
ideas.

<P><EM>&gt;I think this is what cryonics has been looking for.  A cryonicist &gt;enclave 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like this could really capture the positive interest of the &gt;public and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mass media and help to focus our energies in a way that &gt;would really 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefit each other.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is what we are shooting for, and it is very exciting!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I just hope it is designed to be affordable for all income levels.
</EM><BR>
<P>One size does not fit all - we will have to have several sizes and levels of 
<BR>
affordability.  Having been in cryonics for so long, I have come to realize 
<BR>
that we have people from the poverty level to many multi-millionares.  We 
<BR>
want to creat a facility where people from all financial levels can come and 
<BR>
be comfortable - physically and financially.  The commonality here is the 
<BR>
philosophy not one's financial status.  But we realize that wealthy people
<BR>
are going to want certain things that they might be used to and other
<BR>
people are going to be on fixed income and things need to be affordable.
<BR>
<P>We should have very comfortable housing for modest costs. For those on
<BR>
really short incomes, we can provide employment in the resort end of the 
<BR>
facility.  Keep in mind that this is two facilities in one - a resort for 
<BR>
the general public that should generate very good income and a cryonics 
<BR>
community where people can live and work together promoting cryonics and the 
<BR>
philosophy of biological immortality.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A powerful thrill shot through me as I read your post and I hope to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;feel even greater excitement as I read in the future about how 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;construction is going on to make the dream a reality.  Good luck &gt;with it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and I hope you get the support you deserve.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think finances will be the issue - the first big problem is getting 
<BR>
zoning and use approved, I am working on that now.  The land is paid for and 
<BR>
I soon hope to have enough money (within 12 months) to build the first stage 
<BR>
of the lodge and 10 cabins.  After that we will enlarge (bigger lodge + more 
<BR>
cabins) as business grows.  When the resort gets a little bigger, we will 
<BR>
use the excess profit to build the cryonics community:  houses and 
<BR>
apartments, meeting buildings, spa/exercise room, a place to publish our 
<BR>
magazine and a computer workroom and offices for volunteers to &quot;spread the 
<BR>
word.&quot;

<EM>&gt;Subject: Re: CryoNet #13463, cryonics community.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have s similar idea for a lot of time now. I think the real &gt;problem is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one of &quot;critical mass&quot;: There are too few candidate to &gt;organize something.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  That is why I had to couple the cryonics community with some other 
<BR>
income-generating entity.  The idea of a resort and cryonics community fit 
<BR>
together well.  A place to visit for vacation and a place to retire to 
<BR>
later- all in one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;On the other side, I see many cryonicist interested in other advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technical areas, such astronomy, space and rocket, electronics and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;computing to name some of them. Why not then create some techno-&gt;center 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where interested amateurs would find a technical support for &gt;their hobby?
</EM><BR>
<P>I hope we can eventually have things like this.  We want to include as many 
<BR>
things as possible so that like-minded cryonicists/immortalists will *want* 
<BR>
to move here and live here forever (well for a long time).  The things you 
<BR>
mention are the things cryonicists are interested in, and just by the fact
<BR>
that a lot of us are living in the same community these things are bound to 
<BR>
take hold as hobbies and more.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;They could come here for their holidays and then choose to retire on &gt;that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;site.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is exactly why the resort for the public and the cryonics community go 
<BR>
so good together.  During their life time cryonicists can come to the resort 
<BR>
for vacations and get familiar with the facility.  When they get older and 
<BR>
want to retire they will feel comfortable with moving here because they have 
<BR>
visited in many times.
<BR>
Older cryonicists need a common place to retire to. They are most at risk 
<BR>
for sudden death and it will greatly increase their odds of getting a better 
<BR>
suspension if they live in a place that checks on them every morning (good 
<BR>
for younger people too) and makes sure they are ok, or if they need help.
<BR>
<P>When I was at Alcor I found that some of our members (when they became
<BR>
terminal) wanted to move closer to Alcor so they could get a better
<BR>
suspension but they were not comfortable with leaving their homes to go to a 
<BR>
place they were not familiar with.  So most of them stayed at their homes 
<BR>
far from Alcor, and most of them did not get as good of suspensions if they 
<BR>
had moved close.  I want to see this changed.  We must create a facility 
<BR>
where terminal people will not be uncomfortable to move to if we want to 
<BR>
help them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It would be psychologically more interesting than a site where &quot;you &gt;wait 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for death&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the most dreadful things to imagine is being old and very sick. Your 
<BR>
spouse is already dead.  The neighbors don't give a hoot about you and you 
<BR>
are at risk for sudden death.  This dreadful situation can be helped some by 
<BR>
retiring to a cryonics-community where your neighbors are 
<BR>
cryonicists/immortalists and care about you and your philosophy - they will 
<BR>
be there to help you get good care, just as you might help someone else if 
<BR>
you are able to.
<BR>
<P>A person in this situation needs like-minded friends to talk to in these 
<BR>
eventual hard times.  On of the most horrible things that I have seen in the 
<BR>
last 2 decades is where several long-term cryonicists ended up alone, old 
<BR>
and sick - and in this vunerable condition they got talked out of being 
<BR>
suspended.  I want to see this end.

<EM>&gt;Subject: RE: Dave Pizer's Cryonics Supportive Community
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The principal objection to Dave Pizer's proposal for the &gt;establishment of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a Cryonics Suportive Community seems to be that &gt;many people do not want to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;give their home for a small apartment. &gt;This seems understandable.  What 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about a cryonics supportive &gt;manufactured (formerly mobile) home community 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which would rent space &gt;to cryonicists on which they could site their own 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manufactured homes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that there was a wrongful-conception.  This community will provide 
<BR>
homes just as large (or smaller if desired), on lots as large as the 
<BR>
cryonicists used to live in.  There are many retirement communities in 
<BR>
Arizona for us to use for models.  Many of them have large, free-standing 
<BR>
homes on large lots.  Some have  small homes or apartment style living.
<BR>
<P>There is no reason to thing that the facility will only have small
<BR>
apartments.  For those on very limited income there will be small
<BR>
apartments but there also can be larger homes if there are people willing to 
<BR>
pay for them.  For the very wealthy, they may want to buy an estate within a 
<BR>
few miles of the facility.  That way they can have more privacy and still 
<BR>
participate in the events that are going on at the facility.  Although this 
<BR>
parcel of land is surrounded by a 2 to 5 mile wide belt of public land (will 
<BR>
probably be a park) there is other private land nearby. Thanks for the 
<BR>
input.
