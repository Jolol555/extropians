<EM>&gt; &gt; the evidence showing that the only other potentially comparable OS that

<EM>&gt; &gt; is cheaper is actually a 'free' OS that typically costs you $50 on a CD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (windows typically costs about $89.00 on CD-ROM).

<EM>&gt; As a quick point (I am writing other replies to this thread).

<EM>&gt; Although said free OS can be aquired for $50 on CD, it can also be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aquired on CD for $2, or often given away free. I don't think it's fair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to say it's 'typically' bought for $50.
</EM><BR>
<P>I bought SuSe on a CD that was part of a linux book, that retailed for
<BR>
$49.00. I bought it on remainder at a used book store for $15. A used
<BR>
dual processor server I just bought from a guy for $50 happened to have
<BR>
a Red Hat cd stuck in the drive (and he just moved out to Arizona, oh
<BR>
well ;) ), so you could say i got that for free. But I doubt that most
<BR>
people are as cheap as I am. Both are 'previous release' issues, and
<BR>
I've likewise seen Windows 3.1 and Win95 disks available for nothing or
<BR>
next to nothing in similar venues...Buying the latest release of an OS
<BR>
is not likely to be gotten for free or next to nothing. The Corel Linux
<BR>
implementation, for example, I know is not being given away for free, as
<BR>
it is in big demand. According to the Corel Linux site:

<BR>
<P>The standard release price is $59.00, and the deluxe edition is $89.00,
<BR>
no different from windows. I expect due to its easy of installation,
<BR>
that CLOS will remain the dominant linux release (as it already is only
<BR>
a few months after first release). CLOS is essentially a modified
<BR>
version of Debian.
