<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         April 5, 2000
<BR>
<P>STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT: ULYSSES SPACECRAFT MEETS A COMET 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During an unplanned rendezvous, the Ulysses spacecraft found 
<BR>
itself gliding though the immense tail of Comet Hyakutake, 
<BR>
revealing that comet tails may be much, much longer than 
<BR>
previously believed. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The odds that Ulysses' flight path would intersect the 
<BR>
comet tail were probably less likely than someone breaking the 
<BR>
bank at Monte Carlo,&quot; said Dr. Edward Smith of NASA' s Jet 
<BR>
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA, the Ulysses project 
<BR>
scientist and a co-investigator for its magnetometer instrument. 
<BR>
Before the unexpected encounter, Ulysses was hundreds of millions 
<BR>
of kilometers, or miles, away from Comet Hyakutake and far beyond 
<BR>
the visible tail.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This tail extends half a billion kilometers (more than 300 
<BR>
million miles). That's more than three times the distance from 
<BR>
the Earth to the Sun,&quot; said Dr. Nathan Schwadron, of the 
<BR>
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, a member of one of two 
<BR>
Ulysses teams that made the discovery independently of one 
<BR>
another. Findings from both teams appear in the April 6 issue of 
<BR>
the journal Nature.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This makes it the longest comet tail ever recorded,&quot; said 
<BR>
Dr. Geraint Jones from Imperial College, London, of the Ulysses 
<BR>
magnetometer team. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comet Hyakutake, one of the brightest comets of the 20th 
<BR>
century, made a dazzling nighttime appearance in the spring of 
<BR>
1996, when it made a close pass by the Sun. While Ulysses was 
<BR>
cruising through space studying the solar wind on May 1, 1996, 
<BR>
its data suddenly went wild for a few hours. For example, the 
<BR>
solar wind seemed to almost disappear and was replaced by gases 
<BR>
not normally found in the solar wind, and the magnetic field in 
<BR>
the solar wind was distorted. Since Ulysses scientists were not 
<BR>
looking for comets, they did not realize the significance of the 
<BR>
data right away.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The discovery was made quite by accident, a bit like 
<BR>
finding a needle in a haystack when you weren't even looking for 
<BR>
a needle in the first place,&quot; said Dr. George Gloeckler of the 
<BR>
University of Maryland, principal investigator of the Ulysses 
<BR>
solar-wind ion-composition spectrometer team. The instrument 
<BR>
studies the content and electrical charge of ionized gases. While 
<BR>
his team detected ions typically found in comets, the 
<BR>
magnetometer team observed magnetic field directional changes 
<BR>
like those associated with comet tails.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comets are of great interest, because they may be the frozen 
<BR>
leftovers of the birth of our solar system. They could hold clues 
<BR>
to the formation of Earth and life, since one theory holds that 
<BR>
comets &quot;seeded&quot; Earth and other planets with the building blocks 
<BR>
of life. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comets are made of dirty ice, and as they approach the Sun 
<BR>
and heat up, they emit gas and dust, forming gas and dust tails. 
<BR>
The gas slows the solar wind and the portion of the magnetic 
<BR>
field near the comet. The parts of the magnetic field farther 
<BR>
from the comet continue to travel rapidly past it. Magnetic 
<BR>
fields can be stretched like rubber bands. The magnetic field is 
<BR>
draped around the comet and stretches out behind it in a hairpin 
<BR>
shape.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloeckler is lead author of the Nature paper on the ion 
<BR>
findings, along with Schwadron, and Drs. Lennard Fisk and Thomas 
<BR>
Zurbuchen, also of the University of Michigan, and Dr. Johannes 
<BR>
Geiss of the International Space Science Institute in 
<BR>
Switzerland. The other Nature article, on the Ulysses 
<BR>
magnetometer findings, was authored by Jones and Professor Andre 
<BR>
Balogh of Imperial College and Dr. Timothy Horbury of Queen Mary 
<BR>
and Westfield College, London.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones at Imperial College looked more closely at the 
<BR>
magnetic field data because of the publication of the unusual 
<BR>
1996 solar wind event in the Journal of Geophysical Research. It 
<BR>
was authored by Dr. Peter Riley, formerly of Los Alamos National 
<BR>
Laboratory in New Mexico, and based on data from the Ulysses 
<BR>
solar wind instrument. Jones and Horbury saw that the data looked 
<BR>
like a cometary tail, and Jones searched until he found the 
<BR>
tail's source -- Hyakutake. Gloeckler and his colleagues noticed 
<BR>
the event independently and realized it was cometary material.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysses, launched in 1990, is a joint venture of NASA and 
<BR>
the European Space Agency (ESA). The spacecraft studies the Sun 
<BR>
from a high-latitude orbit, mostly at right angles to the plane 
<BR>
of orbiting planets. Ulysses studies the Sun's magnetic fields, 
<BR>
solar winds and cosmic rays near the Sun's North and South Poles, 
<BR>
away from the equator, where Earth orbits. Ulysses has no camera, 
<BR>
but its ten sophisticated instruments can observe some phenomena 
<BR>
not detectable by visible observations. Scientists now know that 
<BR>
sensitive instruments, like those found on Ulysses, can detect 
<BR>
comet tail particles that are not normally visible. The Jet 
<BR>
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) manages Ulysses for NASA's Office of 
<BR>
Space Science, Washington, D.C.
