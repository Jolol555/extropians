<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;...Does anyone else here besides me recognize Larson's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  apparent debt to the late Mad magazine cartoonist Don Martin? spike &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I seem to see Gary Larson as more connected to the Spy v Spy strip. spudboy
</EM><BR>
<P>Martin had a unique way of making sequential actions appear from
<BR>
a single frame.  For instance, I have one of his, a perfect example
<BR>
of Don Martin humor, where a limosine has just dropped off a
<BR>
newlywed couple at the church, slammed the train of her wedding
<BR>
dress in the door and drove away [sound effects: Slam! Vrooom!
<BR>
RRRiiiippp!] and the bride is standing there in her bloomers.  All
<BR>
this is read from one tiny sketch in the margin.
<BR>
<P>I have tried my hand at cartooning, specifically CDBs.  They are
<BR>
all single frame, lots of sight gags.  CDB is where you make words
<BR>
using just one letter only for each word or syllable.  For instance,
<BR>
two boys are sitting in the field when a bee flies by.  One says C D B
<BR>
and the other says O S, I C.
<BR>
<P>I crack myself up with my CDBs.  One of them has
<BR>
a woman in fishnet stockings, high heels and nothing else, with a
<BR>
whip in one hand and a chain in the other.  Caption:

<BR>
<P>Its fun, try it!  spike
