<P><EM>&gt; Also, I don't think the whole space age dream failed -- if it even failed;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  wake up! there are both public and private space programs!:) -- because of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  anything inherent in technoprogress.  Rather, the culture changed.  After
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Apollo, sadly, people on the whole, from my readings (I'm too young to know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  firsthand, but perhaps some of the people who were adults back in the 1970s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  could fill me in -- and correct me if I'm wrong), became more critical of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  visionary technological programs.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're right, Daniel, that people in general lost interest in visionary 
<BR>
technological programs and, for years I thought that was the only reason that 
<BR>
&quot;the space program&quot; ran aground in the 1970s.  But I've come to a different 
<BR>
conclusion now.  The truth is that space didn't pay and with 20th century 
<BR>
technology it never could.  I've yet to see a good economic justification for 
<BR>
the kind of truly massive public spending required to do anything outside of 
<BR>
LEO with that kind of technology and, believe me, I WANT to see such a thing.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Though I agree GNR will help make CAtS better, if we just took that old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Saturn V design, which, if I'm right, is now unpatented, we could be making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  disposable launch vehicles that could put huge cargoes in orbit NOW!  We'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be using a proven technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm no rocket scientist (but I play one when I take people down to MSC for a 
<BR>
tour), but I think simply reproducing the Saturn V would get you nowhere 
<BR>
fast.  It was designed on the premise of non-reusability and LOTS of public 
<BR>
money.  I think you agree that that design philosophy is NOT the way to go.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I also don't agree with the self-sustained model Greg Bear and others buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  into.  The fist European colonies in the New World were not 
</EM><BR>
self-sustaining.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  People in Antarctica live for long periods without be totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  self-sufficient.  Etc.  Surely, living in space is more extreme than these,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  but if you can get oxygen from Moon rocks or asteroids, there's no need for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a perfectly closed ecosystem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The model we should be focusing on is open systems and looking for ways to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  get resources to pump into them cheaply.  This way, we don't need to do all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  kinds of fancy development, testing, and extensive monitoring after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  deployment.  I'd rather have spare air tanks than rely on an intricate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ecosystem to keep me breathing.  (Surely, one could have both, but I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  all of you get my point.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Daniel, if you're going to ask Earth to support an extraterrestrial economy, 
<BR>
I think you have to come up with an economic rationale.  I'm waiting . . .
