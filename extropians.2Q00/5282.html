<P><EM>&gt;I can't claim to have visited many 3rd world countries, but I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spent some time in Mexico. I've noticed 2 major causes of poverty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there.  One is the Catholic church which discourages the use of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contraceptives and abortion. The second is the behavior of people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who hold positions of power in various governmental and corporate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;entities.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately in a country with a bad government, a poor economic
<BR>
system, and high infant mortality having many children may be the
<BR>
only answer to having someone to care for you in your old age.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;When you buy bananas at the grocery store, odds are they came from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;land that was once occupied by people who grew enough food, fiber,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and fuel crops on the land to take care of themselves.  Business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corporations, acting in conjunction with the Mexican (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sometimes the U.S.) government, took over the land and gave the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who'd been using it the option of leaving or staying there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and working for the corporation at very low wages, which they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would use to buy exorbitantly priced food at the grocery store
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(likely also owned by the corporation). The more self-respecting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the disposssed peasants go to seek their fortunes in the city. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The lucky ones have friends in the U.S. who can help them find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work (if they can make it safely across the border and get past
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the check points). Others live on the outskirts of cities such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mexico D.F.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This is the ugly side of capitalism.  If I'm not mistaken, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;term capitalism describes an economic system, not a political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;system.  Capitalism can be practised under conditions of anarchy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(I'm using the word in the sense of a situation where no person or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;group of persons has a legal right to initiate force against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;another person or group)or under the guidance of a totalitarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dictatorship.  At present, the U.S. form of capitalism appears to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be what's known as fascism where, on the surface, individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people appear to own &quot;the means of production&quot; but where their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ownership is severely limited and the actual control lies with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;small elite--in this case, your group of people who hold positions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of power in certain governmental and corporate entities. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Excuse me, this is most certainly NOT a defination of Fascism. You
<BR>
are confusing government corruption and the actions of greedy
<BR>
people, with capitalism.
<BR>
<P>Some have used abused capitalist inventions like the corporation,
<BR>
and were met by another capitalist invention, the trade union.
<BR>
These people then tried (often successfully) to get the government
<BR>
to limit these groups. Others have used pure capitalist means to
<BR>
successfully avoid unions. (Unions are a result of bad management) 
<BR>
<P>What kind of government you have will determine what kind of
<BR>
economic system you have. Capitalism is an economic system, NOT a
<BR>
form of government.
