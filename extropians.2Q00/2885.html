<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I would never, ever suggest that this logic ought to apply to anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other than myself.  There is absolutely nothing morally wrong about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cryonics.  There is absolutely nothing morally wrong about saving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your own life with your own money.  But, by a similar token, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is absolutely nothing morally wrong with choosing to say that your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own life is no more important than anyone else's.  It's my choice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've made it.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you realize that this choice will make everyone that
<BR>
remains after you're gone suffer as much as we are all now suffering
<BR>
now that Sasha is gone?  If sasha had not failed to have himself
<BR>
preserved, how much better would we all feel right know!?  Cryonic
<BR>
preservation isn't just for those that die!  It must also be seen as
<BR>
making it easear for those that would otherwise have to spend billions
<BR>
of years or more missing you and trying to bring you back without
<BR>
a corpsickle to work with.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that it therefor could be argued that it is very
<BR>
selfish on your part to put this suffering and loneliness on and
<BR>
making it so hard on those that remain after you are gone.  (Of course
<BR>
we could be considered selfish by not wanting you to die if such is
<BR>
truly against your will! ;) Your life may not be more important than
<BR>
anyone elses, but it is also no less important either.  Every single
<BR>
life is important isn't it!? Any singularity must make this more true,
<BR>
not less true don't you think!?  How or why would anyone ever think
<BR>
otherwise?
