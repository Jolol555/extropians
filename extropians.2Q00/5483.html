<EM>&gt; &gt;(this is a reply to &quot;RE: &quot;, about whether people leave religion suddenly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;gradually)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Never having been religious, I can't provide much personal insight, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;among people I know who have told me, it always seems to have been a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;situation where there were gradual components, but then there was one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;or instance when they *really* gave it up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- A friend of mine was raped, went to her bishop (Mormon) to confess 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it, he said things like &quot;you knew what was going to happen when you let 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;into your room when your parents were on vacation and now you're just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to say it wasn't your fault because you feel guilty&quot;, she never went to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;church again and had a lot less respect for the religion after that, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;was only after studying it for a while that she came to the more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ontological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;conclusion that was false.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Her bishop really let her down.  People must realize that Mormon bishop's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and other clergy are first and foremost human beings who are capable of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;letting others down.  That poor woman!  Mormon Bishops are not fulltime, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;paid clergy(not to say that is the answer) and despite attempts by the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;general authorities(Mormon top leaders) to educate them in counseling, some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of them are just not very compassionate or understanding.  I have known 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;many in my own life who were wonderful and caring men.  I wish your friend 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;had one of them as her bishop.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just a little disclaimer: from my experience (which is admittedly all 
<BR>
hearsay), this is not common behavior for LDS bishops. This particular 
<BR>
bishop was not a model. Among other things, he'd been spotted in Nevada 
<BR>
gambling on a Sunday (that's 2 strikes for a Mormon).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- Another friend was born outside Utah, and then moved here to go to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;college. I'm not sure how pervasive the Mormon religion is in everyday 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;if you're a minority, but she said that it was definitely different here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;She had a mental breakdown (she didn't give me any details on this), and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;then one day was just sitting and thinking about it, went out and bought 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;coffee maker (Mormons cannot drink coffee), and never went to church 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mormons put a emphasis on achieving perfection, this can lead some women 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who are too hard on themselves into a psychiatric hospital.  It sounds like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;she is did not have a close circle of friends to be with her when she 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;needed it most.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's quite common.. the prozac usage here in Utah is phenomenal. I read 
<BR>
somewhere that it was 6 times the national average in Utah, I've read that 
<BR>
from two different sources, but both were quoting it from someplace else, I 
<BR>
am still on the lookout for a more reliable source on that, but 
<BR>
anectdotally, it's unbelievable. Meth is quite widely used as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Even Mormons who are not used to the Utah Mormon subculture are in &gt;for a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;big shock!!  It is not just your faith down there, but everything else.  A 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;totally inclusive subculture that can intentionally or at least 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unintentionally leave nonmembers or those not &quot;gung-ho&quot; out in the cold.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes but it depends where you live. In a year of living in the Salt Lake 
<BR>
area, I've only been approached by missionaries once. The further south you 
<BR>
get the more saturated it is. In St. George and other areas further south, 
<BR>
there is still a polygamy subculture (they're not allowed in the official 
<BR>
church).
<BR>
About marriage, there's an extreme pressure to mary young, and a sense that 
<BR>
you've failed at something if you're in your 20s and are not married yet. 
<BR>
You mentioned the movie &quot;God's army&quot;, there is a line in it where a girl 
<BR>
missionary says to a boy missiory, &quot;do you know why I went on a mission?&quot;, 
<BR>
he says &quot;because you couldn't find anyone to mary you?&quot;, this is presented 
<BR>
as a humorous insult, and it really took me a second to get it. Friends who 
<BR>
are LDS tell me that whenever they are dating someone, even right after the 
<BR>
first date, their parents will ask things like &quot;so do you see yourself 
<BR>
marrying this guy?&quot;. It's not just among Mormons either, although I assume 
<BR>
that the church is the root of this cultural trait.
<BR>
&quot;God's Army&quot; by the way, I've heard it described as something even a non-LDS 
<BR>
person could enjoy.. I have to disagree. You really have to be immersed in 
<BR>
the culture to &quot;get it&quot; as a film. However, I highly recommend seeing it in 
<BR>
a theater, in Utah, for the cultural experiences. There is a scene involving 
<BR>
a faith healing which, to me.. well, my reaction was different from the rest 
<BR>
of the audience.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Also, I feel my best chance of getting a good mate is within the Mormon 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;church.  I know some think, &quot;you attend to meet women!&quot;  I partially do, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but feel it is the best place for me to look for a good women.  To the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mormon mind and heart being &quot;married in the temple&quot; is their fondest wish 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if it is to the right person.  Again, more contradictions.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not unusual.. I can think of 3 situations off the top of my head 
<BR>
where a guy converted to the religion because he met a girl who wanted a 
<BR>
temple marriage.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;One reason I look forward to being cryosuspended and than reanimated, is so 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have better sources of information on the true nature of reality and our 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;own biology.  Of course, even in the year 2050 or even later, while they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will know so much more, there will still be many unanswered questions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I kind of worry sometimes about how culture may change when/if I'm 
<BR>
reanimated. Given enough time who knows what things could be like. What if, 
<BR>
for example, freedom of speech is completely eliminated. It would be better 
<BR>
to live in such a world then not to live at all, but it causes me some 
<BR>
anxiety.
