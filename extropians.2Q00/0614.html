Robert,
<BR>
<P>Today CNN carried a story about an aging gene called p-21 that is responsible
<BR>
for expressing aging related disease genes--parkinsons being among them long
<BR>
with Alzheimers and more. This was interesting enough but what I wanted to tell
<BR>
you about was the commentator's and CNN's shortsightedness in how they 
<BR>
presented
<BR>
the information. She moronically said we would never cure aging. We would all
<BR>
grow old and die but the study of this gene might help us live better up to our
<BR>
120 year age limit. Then the grey hair smiling guy chimed in that we should all
<BR>
be lucky enough to grow old.
<BR>
<P>I was wondering if you had the clout to introduce them to the myriad efforts
<BR>
made towards defeating aging such as telemere research and the rest I know you
<BR>
have knowledge of. They need to know they've missed a scoop. Is this mainstream
<BR>
ignorance of immortalism simply oversight or by design?
<BR>
<P>James
<BR>
<P>P.S. My email address has changed to swayzej@home.com. I'm not on the list 
<BR>
right
<BR>
now, too busy to keep up, so if you respond you may do so directly please.

<EM> &gt; Harvard Researchers have a model for Parkinson's in Drosophila.

<A HREF="http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/parkinsonsflies000322.html">http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/parkinsonsflies000322.html</A>

<EM> &gt; Now, this is good because it sets the stage for putting genes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that are involved in other pathologies of aging into flies.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; There are some limits to this.  For example, genes involved
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in skeletal structure, joints, arthritis, etc. couldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; be tested in a Drosophila model.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; So here is a question (that I actually don't know the answer to...),
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; What is the shortest lived mammal?  Or other short lived species
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that you could use as models for some aspects of aging in humans?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I seem to recall vaguely there were some unusual animals from Australia
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that had short lifespans.  What about up there in Alaska, got any
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; seasonal species John?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; This isn't just a theoretical question, I've got a conference coming
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; up this summer where we will be discussing a &quot;Roadmap for Lifespan
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Extension&quot; and one of the things we want to discuss is what genomes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; should be sequenced next.  Short-lived organisms allow scientists
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to do experiments and intervention tests more quickly.
</EM><BR>
