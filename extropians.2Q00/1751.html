<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My argument is that companies like GM, et al are hamstrung by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;existing factories, existing machinery and assembly technology,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and by unions that have prevented them from robotization at just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about every turn. There is absolutely no possible way that an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;existing manufacturer can make an aircar for that price, so saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they can 'refit' their factories is a false argument. They would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;go broke trying to do it, and they will still wind up with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;millions of unemployed auto workers.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Aint gonna happen unless they break the UAW and the aerospace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unions. Neither one wants robotized assembly, and you won't get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;affordable aircars any other way.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mike, there are industrial robots in every car plant in America,
<BR>
even the union ones.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;union workers as in a) high salary for low skill work, b) lots of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;convoluted, expensive, and time wasting work rules, c) the union
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;threatens strikes if you want to robotize your assembly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processes. Unless the union reticence against automation is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discarded, then American manufacturing will remain in the 20th
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;century.
</EM><BR>
<P>Gee, I'd like to stick around and debate this, But I've got to go
<BR>
check on my crew recabling the 13th floor. The customer just dumped
<BR>
the addiition of fiber runs from the MDF for new ethernet swtiches,
<BR>
and I got to scope out a run. Then I've got to finish cabling 3
<BR>
Cisco 7500s and an Ascend ATM switch to each other and to dual OC-
<BR>
48 SONET bays. Then there's training on the $350,000 Accord
<BR>
ATM/video server I installed yesterday. 
<BR>
<P>Since I've got to spend most of the weekend studying for my CCNA
<BR>
(Cisco Certified Network Associate) exam, I just don't know when
<BR>
I'll get a chance to sit my lazy ass down and finish that HULK
<BR>
commic book....
