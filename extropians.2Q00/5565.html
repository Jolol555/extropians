<EM>&gt; &quot;Sure, but how much did you pay for the different trucks? Are your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintenance savings more than your increased finance payments, interest,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc.? Do you need more insurance, or higher premiums?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yup...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmmmm...rough figures....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The first truck cost 40K...insurance was about 250 or so a month...maint was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1k monthly......payments were 1200....a month...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The second truck....less the trade in was 54K....insurance was up to about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 350 or so....maint was 1k or so....payments were 1500...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This truck....less trade was about 80K....insurance is 450 or so...maint is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; zero (well....200 every 15 thousand miles for an oil change and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lube)....payments are about 2k..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HOWSOMEVER.....not only was maint in the first two trux about 1K a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; month....the down time (lost income) while they were being fixed....was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comparable.....zero now (approximately)
</EM><BR>
<P>how much does your new truck depreciate compared to your old ones? 
<BR>
<P>On autos, at least, depreciation on new vehicles is so much that you
<BR>
might as well just throw some ball bearings down the air intake as soon
<BR>
as you buy it. (ouch, I know the thought of that hurts!) With my jeep,
<BR>
the first year and a half I had it, I felt like I was in the mafia,
<BR>
because I was so deep into it with all the repairs. Now, though, I've
<BR>
not had any major repairs since a new alternator in May of 1999, and I
<BR>
still get 19.5 mpg with a 4.0 liter engine, which is considered quite
<BR>
good for such vehicles. I think I'll try to drive it through this coming
<BR>
winter, then see what I can buy in the spring thats a few years old, and
<BR>
go over it with a fine toothed comb (and a second mechanical
<BR>
opinion...). I figure the new Navigators will be well depreciated by
<BR>
this time...I want something rather larger than a cherokee. I like to
<BR>
carry lots of tools and other equipment around with me.
<BR>
<P>Seriously, the majority of my family drives cherokees, and this is the
<BR>
first that has had problems like this. I was rather hurt when things
<BR>
started going wrong with it...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Plus...this truck is stronger, safer and more comfortable....(with more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gimmicks)....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Had I shop facilities the situation would be different....Unfortunately all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maint is done &quot;on the fly&quot;...at dealerships or truckstops...at $70
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; +(sometimes way plus)  per shop hour that gets pricey.....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HOWSOMEVER......my new truck is MUCH sexier....
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that obviously is worth it. How are those trucker groupies these
<BR>
days?
