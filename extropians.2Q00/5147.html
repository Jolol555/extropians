<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I would not be so quick to give up on communism.  It has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;adulterated by those modern regimes who now call themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;communist, and its true that current conditions probably do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;lend themselves to an effective form of communism but, eventually,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I believe Marx will prove to have been on to something good.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Yeah, all you need is a transparent society controlled by a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;totalitarian regime, and populated by robots.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually I was thinking more of a society of people enlightened enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realize that what's good for the whole is good for the individual.  It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply a matter of realizing that the surest way to keep your neighbor from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stealing your bread is to be sure that he has enough to keep his own belly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; full.  I call it &quot;enlightened self-interest.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately such a society is unlikely to be stable for long as long as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is not enough to go around for *everyone*.  But hopefully that minor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem will soon be solved by the good folks over at Foresight :)
</EM><BR>
<P>With nanotech, you don't need to give a hoot what your neighbor is doing
<BR>
to feed himself. And what is good for the whole is most decidedly NOT
<BR>
good for the individual. Its good for the whole if the clothing industry
<BR>
only needs to make one style of clothing, and the most efficient design
<BR>
is this nice brown Mao suit. Its obviously good for the whole if
<BR>
everyone wore Mao suits all day. Where is yours, Zero? Lead by
<BR>
example...
