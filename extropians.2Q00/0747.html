<P>According to him, if you have been drinking French wine bottled in the
<BR>
last several years, there is a good chance that it was made with
<BR>
California grapes anyway.  Apparently several years of declining domestic
<BR>
quality have forced some of the producers, including some fairly well
<BR>
regarded ones, to buy product from the growing number of U.S. producers to
<BR>
maintain the product quality of what they put their labels on.  His advice
<BR>
was that, except for a few exceptional French producers, you are better
<BR>
off buying California wine in the U.S.  Right now, French wine is generally
<BR>
inferior to its California equivalent or California wine with a French
<BR>
label, so it is difficult to justify purchasing French wine in the U.S.
<BR>
for the most part.  In general my experience agrees with this.
