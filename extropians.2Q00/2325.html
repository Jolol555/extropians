<EM>&gt; &gt;On a slightly lighter note, I have noticed how kids dont
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;drag race anymore.  Mike, I am a few years older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;than you, so I recall drag real racing.  {8-]  Since kids
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;dont drag, people now make a habit of running red lights,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a habit that never presented itself back in the days when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;running a red light *could* result in being T-boned by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;two roaring hotrods.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Around here (Chicago) they sure haven't stopped! The big difference is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the racers today don't have classic hotrods modified for racing. They are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more likely to be nailing the throttle in Mommy's Voyager or BMW.
</EM><BR>
<P>Today on the way to work, I was coming into little old Wilder on Main street
<BR>
(speed limit 30 mph) at 35 mph. I was passed on a double yellow single lane each
<BR>
way road by not one but two cars full of teenagers going at least 45 mph. No
<BR>
intersections around. This sort of situation I can completely understand my
<BR>
taking pictures to use as evidence, because a) there was traffic, b) oncoming
<BR>
traffic, and c) they were both speeding and passing on a double yellow line.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Three intersections locally now have what appears to be cameras mounted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; above each center lane signal. There has been no public announcement as to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these being for surveillance, and from the angle they are mounted at, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looks like they would have a hard time capturing driver's images and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; license plates. Perhaps an image processing traffic light controller?
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope. Its a light pulse sensor unit that allows oncoming police, fire engines,
<BR>
and ambulances with their lights going to cause the light to turn green. Here's
<BR>
a fun thing to do, especially at night: Learn to get a sense of the strobe rates
<BR>
of the emergency lights of these vehicles, then at night flash your high beams
<BR>
on and off several times at that rate (hopefully when nobody is coming in the
<BR>
opposite direction) as you approach the intersection. I do this and its pretty
<BR>
good at turning the lights green for me at intersections that have this
<BR>
capability. This is a good way to go through lonely intersections without
<BR>
actually breaking the law... ;)
<BR>
<P>If you are really smart, buy yourself a hand strobe with a variable setting and
<BR>
keep it set to a frequency similar to emergency vehicles....as long as it
<BR>
doesn't look like a siren, you aren't impersonating an official vehicle...
