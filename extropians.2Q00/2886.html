<P>A droid for all seasons
<BR>
<P>No job is too unusual for a breed of robots that reinvent themselves 
<BR>
<P>IMAGINE an automaton that can design itself, assemble itself and even
<BR>
kill itself. No, it's not the liquid metal robot from Terminator 2--but
<BR>
this droid can certainly build itself to perform a particular task,
<BR>
melt itself down and recycle itself, say researchers in Massachusetts. 
<BR>
<P>The scientists have developed what they call a polymorphic robot--a
<BR>
machine that can change its shape to suit the job in hand. 
<BR>
Shape-shifting robots could be used as planetary explorers, or for
<BR>
search-and-rescue missions, changing their shape to meet each new
<BR>
challenge and adapting to strange and unpredictable environments. 
<BR>
<P>The researchers have produced a simple thermoplastic-framed robot, says
<BR>
Hod Lipson, who developed it with Jordan Pollack at Brandeis
<BR>
University, near Boston. &quot;All the robot has to do is find a way to
<BR>
move,&quot; he says. The prototype is very basic and has no sensors, so it
<BR>
is unaware of the world, though sensors could be added at a later
<BR>
design stage. 
<BR>
<P>The idea is that a task will be set for the robot, such as: &quot;Figure out
<BR>
how to move using only one leg and one motor.&quot; A computer will then
<BR>
attempt to design a body that will help it to meet this challenge most
<BR>
efficiently. At present, the robot's body is built using the &quot;rapid
<BR>
prototyping&quot; technology common in the car industry, which can produce
<BR>
complex three-dimensional structures very quickly. A device called a 3D
<BR>
printer uses a nozzle to build up progressive layers of thermoplastic,
<BR>
slowly creating the required structure (click on thumbnail graphic
<BR>
below). 
<BR>
<P>Although 3D printers are large and cumbersome, says Lipson, much
<BR>
smaller ones could one day be built into a robot, allowing it to change
<BR>
parts of its body, for example, to reshape an arm to produce a new tool
<BR>
for a novel situation. Mark Yim of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center
<BR>
(PARC) in California says this is one area in which polymorphic robots
<BR>
could be most useful. There's no point in taking an entire toolkit into
<BR>
space, he says, when you don't know which tools you'll need: a single
<BR>
robot arm can be shaped to do the job of all of them.
<BR>
<P>It is also conceivable, says Lipson, that the 3D printing technology
<BR>
will allow several materials to be printed, including conductive,
<BR>
nonconductive and even semiconductive materials. &quot;Wires, motors and
<BR>
logic circuits, as well as structure, could be printed in one pass
<BR>
without the need for assembly,&quot; Lipson predicts. 
<BR>
<P>With each new task, the look of a polymorphic robot is impossible to
<BR>
predict, because each design is &quot;evolved&quot; using a genetic algorithm.
<BR>
The physical structure, and the neural network that will be the brains
<BR>
of the proposed robot, are treated like genetic information that can be
<BR>
combined and mutated in simulation to produce entirely new designs. The
<BR>
&quot;fitness&quot; of these offspring is then evaluated and the best are &quot;bred&quot;
<BR>
to produce more offspring. This process is repeated many times until
<BR>
the design has evolved to do the best job. 
<BR>
<P>To keep things simple, Lipson allowed the algorithm only basic
<BR>
components with which to design the prototype robot: straight plastic
<BR>
bars of varying lengths and electric motors that can extend or shrink
<BR>
the length of a bar. Joints are all ball-and-socket designs, as these
<BR>
are easily created by a 3D printer. From these basic parameters a host
<BR>
of complex--sometimes lifelike--structures have been evolved. 
<BR>
<P>Some versions push themselves along on one leg, while others produce a
<BR>
hinge-like motion and crawl about like a fish out of water. Yet another
<BR>
moves sideways like a crab. &quot;The robot is ready to move when it comes
<BR>
out of the printer,&quot; says Lipson. Its motor, however, must be inserted
<BR>
by a person. But the aim is to make the robots totally independent,
<BR>
much like the vengeful shape-shifter in Terminator 2. 
<BR>
<P>When the robot has performed its task, it offers itself up to be melted
<BR>
down, so its thermoplastic components can be recycled into another
<BR>
useful droid by the 3D printer. The idea of building and melting down
<BR>
robots is novel, says Yim, who makes modular robots that reshape
<BR>
themselves by fitting smaller robots together. &quot;I've never seen
<BR>
anything like it.&quot; But he warns that to make truly useful robots,
<BR>
stronger plastics and more materials are needed.
