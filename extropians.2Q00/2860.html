<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, but let's try to avoid a general protection fault :)

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I think that's what Zen is about; trying to get your mind to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; blue-screen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ah! NOW I understand the meaning of the &quot;Guru Meditation Error&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; message on Amiga computers when they crashed! :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was asking merely that we try to avoid crashing the Universe/
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ecology!
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, assuming that the ecology would go into a thrashing mode, we could either
<BR>
work our butts off to introduce negative feedback into the system to help
<BR>
stabilize things, or else try to do something with Closed Timelike Curves to hit
<BR>
the Universe's reset switch (not sure about the locality of such events, are
<BR>
they supposed to apply to the whole universe, or just some localized area, say a
<BR>
parsec or so?) to return the system to a state prior to the system instability,
<BR>
and try to prevent the chaos inducing trends.
<BR>
<P>Thinking further on the CTC possibility, and having just finished Greg Egan's
<BR>
Diaspora, I'm wondering if the Gamma Ray Bursts that occur due to black hole
<BR>
formation might not be a natural protection mechanism the universe has to
<BR>
prevent intelligent races from using black holes to alter history, that the GRB
<BR>
cleans out a given volume of space of intelligent life, thus ensuring that
<BR>
surviving intelligent races outside the kill zone would have to travel hundreds
<BR>
or thousands of light years before they can reach the black hole, at which point
<BR>
the motivation to alter ancient history becomes moot.
<BR>
<P>I also just finished an article in Scientific American (or was it American
<BR>
Scientist?) about current research in generating metallic hydrogen. Given the
<BR>
current fusion technologies that are working either generate sub-breakeven
<BR>
levels of energy or are not sustainable for long periods of time, and that
<BR>
natural sustained fusion processes all seem to arise from naturally occuring
<BR>
metallic hydrogen agglomerations (i.e. stars) at sufficient core pressures (i.e.
<BR>
somewhere between Jovian core pressures and Solar core pressures), I'm getting
<BR>
the idea that a sustained fusion system is going to have to utilize metallic
<BR>
hydrogen in some way, perhaps a cell of compressed metallic hydrogen bombarded
<BR>
by some sort of radiation to catalyse fusion. I'm doubtful that the rather
<BR>
tenuous plasma systems we currently use will ever amount to much more than
<BR>
experimental tiddlywinks or gloified neutron generators.
