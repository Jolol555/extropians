<P><EM>    &gt;First, about Brian [Delaney]. He's smart, *very* smart. ultra-whiz-kid type smart.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not impressed with being told how smart he is, I want him to show us how smart he is.
<BR>
Actually I would be very surprised indeed if Mr. Delaney turned out to be as smart as me,
<BR>
but I'm always willing to be proven wrong, I'd love to see him dazzle me with his brilliance.
<BR>
<P>I don't think that's likely to happen, I think he's dumb as a post, or insane, or both.
<BR>
I can give two reason in support of my theory of Mr. Delaney's mental capacity:
<BR>
<P>1) He expressed great surprise that calling somebody a racist would make them angry.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Racism has caused more misery in the world than just about anything else, it follows
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that intelligent people are insulted when they're accused of endorsing it. It only takes is a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room temperature IQ to figure that out but it seems to have confuse Mr. Delaney.
<BR>
<P>2) The reasons he gave to demonstrate our racism were subtle, very subtle, insanely subtle.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at what we say, don't look for Anti Semitic messages encoded in the way we blink our
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes, because If there is one characteristic that all Extropians have it is that we are not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ashamed of our views; if we thought there was something wrong with the Jews we would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say so loud and clear. We don't so we haven't. It's true that several years ago somebody
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said that The Holocaust never happened, but he was blasted into oblivion by many members
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of this list, myself included.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John K Clark       <A HREF="mailto:jonkc@att.net?Subject=Re:%20Brian,%20Life%20of&In-Reply-To=&lt;009601bfdec1$fce84c80$1cb74d0c@flrjs&gt;">jonkc@att.net</A>
