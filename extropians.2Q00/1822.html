<EM>&gt; that are technologically capable of  colonizing Brown Dwarfs as nano-class 
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<P>Why would you think that?  I can detail a very clear path for dismantling
<BR>
rock planets using solar power collectors and mass drivers (current
<BR>
technology).  Gas Giants (up to Brown Dwarf size) are a bit harder because
<BR>
they don't have a solid surface to stand on, but the recent discussions
<BR>
on dirigibles show ways to deal with this.  Converting the useful material
<BR>
into computronium poses no new technology requirements (just lots of
<BR>
silicon wafer factories).  Presumably the computers that result from
<BR>
this (with perhaps some AI) are capable of designing nanocomputers,
<BR>
quantum computers, etc. somewhat closer to the theoretical limits.
<BR>
It might take 30 billion years to provably construct an &quot;optimal&quot;
<BR>
megamind, but getting *most* of the way from where we are now to
<BR>
where those limits probably are is something we will probably do
<BR>
within the next 100 years.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The cosmos might be mostly empty of intelligence of any kind for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; billions and billions of years.  Just because a Von Newmann, or a Bracewell 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highlight the path, doesn't mean that there will not be huge bottle-necks 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; along the way. But eventually...eventually... 
</EM><BR>
<P>In the 8 years since the publication of Nanosystems, people haven't
<BR>
managed to refute it.  If anything, there now appear to be more paths
<BR>
to getting there than were imagined at that time.
<BR>
<P>You have to detail the bottle-necks so I can respond to them
<BR>
or admit they seem real.  If you don't you are just doing your best
<BR>
impression of a Scientific American writer... :-)  So far the most
<BR>
difficult problem I can see is the one of dismantling stars.  That
<BR>
probably isn't impossible, it just may require more metallic material
<BR>
than is locally available to accomplish this in reasonable timescales.
<BR>
The path I outlined does not require that and would seem to have
<BR>
moderately short time scales except for orbital corrections.
