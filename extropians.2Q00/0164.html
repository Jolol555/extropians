&nbsp;<A HREF="mailto:EvMick@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Spike%20is%20kin%20to%20those%20Hatfields!&In-Reply-To=&lt;3.0.6.32.20000403190746.007b0290@coastside.net&gt;">EvMick@aol.com</A> got it exactly right when he wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A more accurate statement would be.....&quot;these programs are a new source of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;revenue while incindently they can be spun as a saftey program&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>But it is not the safety &quot;spin&quot; which is incidental, but the safety itself.
<BR>
&nbsp;And, of course, the real driving force behind this is, as always, more
<BR>
money for more government.  The enhancement of authoritarianism; the
<BR>
pleasant exercise of crude power and control; automated extortion and petit
<BR>
terrorism, well, they're just icing on the cake.
<BR>
<P>How will this play out?  Initially revenue will expand.  Lockmart will use
<BR>
this to sell the tech to as many other cities as they can.  Governments
<BR>
being what they are, this will be many other cities.  Then, as people
<BR>
modify their driving habits, and run fewer red lights, the revenue will
<BR>
decrease.  In an effort to maintain the revenue, the fines will be
<BR>
increased, and the program will be expanded to other areas, as variations
<BR>
on the technology make it feasible.  I would guess speeding would be the
<BR>
next big payoff.  Then you'll be pretty much well along the path to
<BR>
ubiquitous government surveillance.  And of course only a perp or a
<BR>
sociopath would object. After all, it's government's job to keep you safe. 
<BR>
<P>Rodney King gets the shit kicked out of him.  Everyone else gets nickel and
<BR>
dimed to death.
<BR>
<P>If someone has a solution, I'm ready to hear about it.
<BR>
<P>(I've always felt that cops should not have the liability for their
<BR>
misdeeds transferred to the city, and thence to the taxpayer, but that they
<BR>
should bear the responsibility themselves, as do most (should be all) other
<BR>
professionals.  Then they have to get insurance (or self insure backed by
<BR>
the cop pension funds).  That would bring them in line real fast.  By a
<BR>
similar logic, all fines for criminal and traffic offenses should be
<BR>
rebated directly and in full to the citizens.  This would take the &quot;revenue
<BR>
source&quot; motivation out of any govenment action that generated money through
<BR>
fines.)  If democracy was anything but fraudulent, approaches like this
<BR>
might work.  In the real world (the world as I see it), it's like expecting
<BR>
water to run uphill.
<BR>
<P>Work hard.  Pay your taxes.  Work some more.  Smile.  Was it good for you?
<BR>
Die quietly.
<BR>
<P>Only the unsophisticated camel owner breaks the beast's back with that last
<BR>
straw--and even that is a myth.  In the real world, the beast is worked to
<BR>
the limit, and then eaten.   Not to worry.  Camels make more camels, an
<BR>
endless supply.  It's the same with people.   
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
