<EM>&gt; &gt; Mark Steyn devoted his monthly column in the July 2000 &quot;American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Spectator&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  magazine to violent crime in Britain, with a particular focus on victims
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  were prosecuted for resisting violent attacks. Many Britons are now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fearful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  of defending themselves, not because they think their assailants will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; treat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  them any worse, but because the police and courts will.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     As a British citizen this is something I have thought about and talked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about in depth with friends. The concensus seems to be that most people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use whatever force they deemed neccessary to protect themselves and their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possesions. Of course when it comes to the crunch, I think most people would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be too shocked to put up as much of a fight as they would want to.
</EM><BR>
<P>That IS a problem, and I've said that people who are not set and
<BR>
determined to defend themselves should not carry a weapon.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     I for one would shoot first and worry about the consequences later.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately a paintball gun probably wouldn't give me much protection from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a buglar, but at least a luminous green painted criminal would be easier for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the police to find.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Public opinion here is just about 100% behind anyone that does harm to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone attacking them or their property and it seems that the law is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becoming more leaniant towards anyone in this position. At the end of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; day, 2 wrongs..........so I think the emphisis should be on preventing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crime in the first place rather than aguing about any crimes that were as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; direct result. Also if criminals know that their victims will get off scott
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free for bludgeoning them to death with a golf club in the name of self
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defense, They are more likely to carry weapons and use them for their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     cha..ching........oops, my two cents ran out. I was just getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe you can inject mace or capscicum into your paintballs.... boy,
<BR>
that would be *interesting*, seeing a glowing green thing running
<BR>
screaming with a brit accent down the street. As for criminals going
<BR>
armed, all that means is you need your own Operation Exile: guaranteed
<BR>
prison sentence for felons caught with weapons.
