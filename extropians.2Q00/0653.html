<P>The ABA is a government supported monopoly.  Without the government to back
<BR>
its power, it would face serious competition from law clinics (which it
<BR>
already does in some states of the US*), unlicensed lawyers, etc.  See,
<BR>
e.g., _The Rule of Experts: Occupational Licensing in America_ by S. David
<BR>
Young for other examples of businesses that use the government to avoid the
<BR>
market.
<BR>
<P>The remedy for this situation seems quite clear:  Eliminate government
<BR>
interference in the market.  Of course, one could choose the typical route:
<BR>
Increase government interference to undo the problems of previous government
<BR>
interventions.  BUT that only results in a spiral of regulations, protected
<BR>
businesses and people, and politics coopting consumer choice.  At least,
<BR>
this has almost always been the case when people opt for more and stricter
<BR>
regulations.  (In fact, I can't think of one counterexample to this claim.:)

<P>* Recently, the law clinic at some Louisiana law school was banned from
<BR>
helping people unless the people being helped could prove they made less
<BR>
than some minimum income standard.  The reason?  People were using the law
<BR>
clinic to sue one of the governor's supporters over, I believe, some
<BR>
pollution issue.  The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that this was practicing
<BR>
law without a license -- except in the case of the indigent.  In other
<BR>
words, the court protected the monopoly privilige of lawyers from an actual
<BR>
competitor.  (I believe this was on either &quot;60 Minutes&quot; a few months ago.)
