<P>Actually, one of the (least important) reasons I chose neuro was that I

didn't like the idea of hanging upsidedown for 50 years.  All of us have

our irrational quirks.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the meantime, I came up with another idea.  Is there a third

<EM>&gt; choice whereby the brain is removed and frozen by itself?  
</EM><BR>
<P>There are a handful of such cases.  If I am not mistaken, they are
<BR>
invariably the result of salvaging the remains of state mandated autopsy,
<BR>
and in very bad shape.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I can even imagine a brain-only deal might actually *increase* the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the brain mass, thereby reducing warm-brain injury.  Is that
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really.  Aside from the extreme difficulty of finding skilled surgeons
<BR>
willing to do cryonics, the surgery you suggest is difficult to say the
<BR>
least.  The rubbery brains you see on TV are the results of the brains
<BR>
being fixed in preservative.  A fresh brain has about the consistency of
<BR>
Jello.  Removing a brain that can then be perfused with cryoprotectant is
<BR>
just about impossible.  Brains are removed at autopsies, but they
<BR>
really don't care if it comes out in pieces.  Nor would it reduce warm
<BR>
ischemia.  The fastest way to cool even a removed brain is by perfusing
<BR>
cold fluid through the vasculature, and that is *much* easier to do in an
<BR>
intact body that isn't leaking everywhere.
<BR>
<P>It might be possible after the body has been transported to a facility and
<BR>
cryoprotected to remove the brain for storage, but that would not save any
<BR>
space, increase the cost, reduce the quality of the procedure, and likely
<BR>
result in a pretty cut up brain.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is there a company doing brain-only cryopreservation?  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may well be my father-in-law's only hope.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so.  
<BR>
<P>At the risk of giving people bad ideas, there may be a last minute do it
<BR>
yourself method.  Pay for an autopsy, and if you are lucky you may talk
<BR>
them into giving you the brain.  Pack in dry ice for a straight freeze,
<BR>
and try to arrange for long term storage.  Likely you won't succeed.
