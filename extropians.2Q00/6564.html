</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Infrastructure is good. Mmm, infrastructure.
<BR>
<P>Economic restriction inversely correlates with innovation... well, here's a
<BR>
case study...
<BR>
<P>I'm currently living in the world of self employed IT contracting. It's
<BR>
pretty risky, and I don't have savings to fall back on (yet), if jobs fall
<BR>
through. I'm working for your classic startup, woefully undercapitalised but
<BR>
with a brilliant vision and a damned good (although by no means certain)
<BR>
chance to make some sales. Cool.
<BR>
<P>However... this is a terribly risky venture for me. Particularly, I find
<BR>
myself wondering, often, if the next paycheck will arrive (which they always
<BR>
have, to my employer's continued credit). My current situation is that, for
<BR>
various reasons, the contract will do one of two things at the start of
<BR>
August:
<BR>
1 - Terminate
<BR>
2 - Continue (part time, which means I'm taking on other work anyway, but
<BR>
that's an aside)
<BR>
<P>This is a difficult situation that many contractors face; I do not know
<BR>
whether I will have a job past 1 August. Do I stay? Suddenly, my income
<BR>
stream may evaporate, and what does my family eat?
<BR>
Do I go? It takes a while to organise new work; I'd have to do it now, and
<BR>
chuck in this project. But I have a stake in this project (ie: some
<BR>
ownership), I believe in it, and I think I could profit quite substantially;
<BR>
that's why I've borne the risk so far.
<BR>
<P>The key concept here is risk. Can I afford to bear the risk, believing as I
<BR>
do that the gains will be substantial, if only we can hang on? I've got
<BR>
little kids; they have to come first in such a decision. I don't have
<BR>
savings, I don't have a network of wealthy family or friends to fall back
<BR>
on. A week without a paycheck is not tolerable.
<BR>
<P>Except that it is. Luckily, I'm in a country with a solid welfare system.
<BR>
Much as I'd loathe doing it, I have this to fall back on. While welfare
<BR>
would be a substantial income drop, it would be enough to keep us going
<BR>
indefinitely. I've been double checking this, because things are at a
<BR>
particularly dicey and anxiety generating point for me. Now I'm sleeping
<BR>
easier (when I have time!).
<BR>
<P>So what do I do? My decision is to stick in there. That's what I want to do,
<BR>
and I can because of this nasty socialist government (hoo hoo, there's a
<BR>
laugh) and the welfare system.
<BR>
<P>If there was no welfare system, I would be back in the public service like a
<BR>
shot (except there probably wouldn't be a public service; how about a big IT
<BR>
company, or Andersons, someone like that). The system I'm building would
<BR>
likely not exist, and have no hope of existing. My personal career as a
<BR>
contractor, and my new company, for which I have many, many plans, would
<BR>
remain a pipedream.
<BR>
<P>I'd be paying less tax. But I'd be far less innovative.
<BR>
