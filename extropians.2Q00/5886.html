<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  I don't know where this discussion came from and only had time to quickly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  skim it on this busy morning, but the idea that extropianism is &quot;right wing&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  in the sense that that term is usually used in popular discourse is just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  plain wrong.  The idea that it is anti-Semitic is so absurd that I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  imagine anyone coming to such a conclusion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It comes from leftist/socialist jews who can't imagine the thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of a jew not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;being leftist/socialist, so they automatically assume that anyone or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;any opinion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that seems conservative or anti-socialist is automatically anti-semitic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Aargh!  Just as we're being accused of anti-Semitism, Mike goes and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blames the Jews!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike, do you have any evidence for this assertion?  Are you really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claiming that the Jews are behind this attack on the Extropians?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please post some hard evidence.  Otherwise, you are just reinforcing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these accusations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since half my family is jewish, accusing me of anti-semitism is pretty stupid.
<BR>
LISTEN VERY CLOSELY: I am most pointedly NOT blaming &quot;THE JEWS&quot; for anything.
<BR>
There are liberals of all ethnic types, including many hypersensitive jewish
<BR>
people, that think its perfectly acceptable to demonize their opponents in
<BR>
political discourse by accusing them of being anti-semitic, racist, bigots, what
<BR>
have you, simply because they oppose liberal ideas. This is a very typical
<BR>
strategy by modern liberals who wish to force debate participants into the
<BR>
extremes, in order to eliminate any possibility for middle or common ground, for
<BR>
compromise or consensus. Once they have successfully alienated their opponents
<BR>
from rational consideration from the mainstream, they then can say &quot;Look, we are
<BR>
reasonable, they are being extremists, so everyone ought to look on our
<BR>
proposals as moderate compromises by reasonable people, so lets all be
<BR>
reasonable together.&quot;
<BR>
<P>If you still claim that you don't understand my points or think I am still being
<BR>
anti-semitic, I suppose I could use your strategy against you and say that since
<BR>
you are purposely trying to alienate a reasonable view, then you are trying, in
<BR>
fact, to practice the strategy that I illustrated above, and are trying to be
<BR>
divisive and alienating, so therefore you must be an extremist, while my
<BR>
position is one of reasonableness..... Now, how does that feel?
