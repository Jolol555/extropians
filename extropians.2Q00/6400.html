<P>
A possible explanation for the recent observation of 300X speed-of -light 
<BR>
photons.
<BR>
<P>Consider the summation of pathways procedure (path integral) in the 
<BR>
Feynman picture of Quantum Electrodynamics:
<BR>
<P>A photon appears to have gone from source (point 'A') to detector (point 'B'),
<BR>
a distance X from 'A' in a straight line. In actuality (meaning in reality) the 
<BR>
photon samples all possible paths between 'A' and 'B', including paths 
<BR>
that that involve backward and forward time travel. The net sum of this 
<BR>
procedure is the straight line at c.
<BR>
<P>If some modes, or paths, are suppressed in some asymmetric fashion, the 
<BR>
photon would either a) not travel in a straight line or b) arrive at 'B' sooner 
<BR>
or later than expected or c) both.
<BR>
<P>For the case of interest, paths that take longer than X/c would be suppressed 
<BR>
in the construction of the photon's wavefront.
<BR>
One method of suppression would be to destructive interfere with some of the 
<BR>
slower modes of propagation, using either a time-delayed  (or advanced) photon, 
<BR>
or simply a simultaneous photon. 
<BR>
<P>A crude example: Place a mirror off-axis from the A-B line. For simplicity, 
<BR>
consider the mirror to be tilted such that a photon from 'A' could specularly 
<BR>
reflect to 'B' (this condition isn't strictly necessary). Two linearly-polarized 
<BR>
photons are launched simultaneously from 'A', 180 degrees out of phase. In this 
<BR>
crude picture, one photon, P1, only goes to the mirror, then to 'B' , the other 
<BR>
is an ordinary photon, P2. The component of P2 that coincided with P1 is 
<BR>
therefore destructively interfered with by P1. 
<BR>
As this was a longer path, the net summation of P2 is an overspeed.
<BR>
<P>In practice, I'm guessing, the mode cancellation might have been carried out by 
<BR>
a  (perhaps doubled for phase correction) application of four-wave mixing using 
<BR>
the equivalent of the off-axis mirrors. A pre-cooled, sub millikelvin atomic 
<BR>
gas would be necessary to restrict line broadening effects. An advanced
<BR>
conjugate 
<BR>
probe pulse (delay path/transition lifetime) might provide the requisite
<BR>
interference.
<BR>
<P><P>If this is the correct interpretation, several predictions follow, such as:
<BR>
<P>1) Increasing the number of slow-path suppression modes increases the observed 
<BR>
overspeed.
<BR>
<P>2) The further the detector is placed from the source, the less the overspeed, 
<BR>
converging asymptotically back to c at sufficient separation.
