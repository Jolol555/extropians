<EM>&gt; Surveillance has *nothing* to do with freedom.  You are free now to do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything that is legal.  You would have that exact same freedom in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely transparent society.  Your only loss of freedom would be the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom to commit a crime and get away with it.  If you have a problem with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; giving that up, I think that says more about you than it says about society.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes: it says that your personal sense of morals differs from that of
<BR>
society.  It doesn't say whether it is better or worse, just different.
<BR>
Given the society we live in, it's very likely that many people's
<BR>
morals are superior to those of society.  I, for instance, would not
<BR>
want the government to know that I am supplying marijuana to AIDS
<BR>
patients, even though I consider it the morally right thing to do, and
<BR>
am proud of doing it.
<BR>
<P>In a sense, &quot;privacy&quot; is analogous to violence or deception: there would
<BR>
be no need for it in a perfect world, but since the folks in power are
<BR>
using those things to oppress us, we'd better use them in self-defense.
<BR>
I consider it a moral duty to hide from and cheat a tyrannical government.
<BR>
<P>As (I think) Krishnamurti pointed out, it is no sign of mental health to
<BR>
be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.
