<EM> &gt; When I was in High School, I broke my glasses and was without them for

<EM> &gt; just over a week.  I have really horrible vision and had to be almost

<EM> &gt; on top of people to recognize their faces.  I found though that I was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; able to recognize people at distance by the way they moved.  I could
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; recognize  movement in even large blurry objects.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've done more or less the same thing. For a lot of the time I didn't
<BR>
use to wear my glasses, but I didn't have trouble recognising people. An
<BR>
upshot of this (following a little experimentation and comparison with
<BR>
others) is that I can recognise people very easily in dim light, at long
<BR>
distance, or in other difficult visual conditions.
<BR>
<P>It's noticing and following up on things like this that I really enjoy
<BR>
doing. People who think about how their mind, body and senses actually
<BR>
work, and how they can be best used, can be a degree of magnitude more
<BR>
aware and effective in response than those who don't.
<BR>
<P>I think it's a terrible shame that in everyday life one doesn't usually
<BR>
have the opportunity to take advantage in these areas. You have to find
<BR>
the situations for yourself. And create them.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; It made me wonder how many different methods do we as humans use to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; recognize each other, while only being directly concious of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; obvious.
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends very much on how familiar you are with a person. With my own
<BR>
family, I can tell exactly who is walking around the house where by
<BR>
their footsteps, for example.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I do have a couple of friends that I am sure I could recognize by smell.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ditto.
