<EM>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately for MS, they seem to have been quite unable to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; straightforward or forthright about their reasons for managing at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one key issue the way that they have. Specifically, as an actual user of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Win98, I can confidently report that it was totally unnecessary for them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to insist that a Microsoft web browser be packaged with every copy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Windows98 -- in other words, there was no *technical* necessity for then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to market things that way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Maybe this is picky, but I would feel better about MS if they had said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all along that including the browser was strictly a case of marketing or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; packaging, it being their commercial right not to offer anything less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than a package deal if they don't want to?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe what they actually said was that it is a competitive necessity for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any modern OS to come with a bundled web browser.  Since I can't think of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modern OS that doesn't come with someone's browser, I think this is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonable claim.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As far as saying that Windows won't run without MS Internet Explorer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if MS does things in a way that unnecessarily restricts its customers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that counts for more than all the complaints of a thousand competing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; companies, it seems to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, this is a good example of the MS approach to system optimization.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What happened was once they decided they needed to include the a browser
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with every copy of the OS, they started thinking about how to do that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without generating more complaints about code bloat.  So, they basically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; went through the IE feature list, found everything that duplicated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functionality they wanted to be part of the OS, and started integrating the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; duplicated features.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The fact that this lets them claim IE is an essential part of the OS was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably a factor in their decision, but it makes good technical sense too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why implement multiple systems for things like screen rendering, hyperlink
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; navigation, and XML support if you don't have to?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, what they have now is a software library that implements almost all of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the IE functionality, and is also used by Windows wherever it presents a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; similar feature.  The IE program itself is just a thin wrapper around this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functionality.  You can remove IE, but you can't get rid of the COM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; components that implement most of its features without breaking the system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OTOH, you can also use those components from your own programs, which is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nice benefit for ISVs and other sophisticated users of the OS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at some point the presumption of customers' intelligence and freedom to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ought to be placed foremost, don't you think?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've never understood why people think this is an issue.  You are perfectly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free to use any browser you want.  You can get rid of the IE icon and menu
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; item if you want to, and since browsers are free there isn't even a cost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issue involved.  So, how is the fact that MS decided to build an HTML engine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into their OS hurting anyone other than Netscape?

</EM><BR>
<P>Well, there is Opera, HotJava, any of a variety of web browser manufacturers on
<BR>
Win32.  By the same token, before Windows had TCP/IP stack, there was Trumpet
<BR>
Winsock.  Does the fact that MS decided to build office application support into
<BR>
the OS hurt anyone other than Lotus, Novell, Corel, etc?
<BR>
<P>Removing the Internet Explorer &quot;E&quot; icon is not feasible.  It is scary for
<BR>
neophyte users.
<BR>
<P>As aWindows user, what I want is the ability to add and remove all components of
<BR>
the operating system and rebuild the kernel fine-tuned to my specifications.
<BR>
Also, as I am paranoid, I want to verify system security which is not feasible
<BR>
otherwise.
<BR>
<P>I want an interface to the registry like &quot;regedit&quot; that has simple features to
<BR>
collate all of the myriad keys spread throughout the system for a variety of
<BR>
components and to be able to remove those entries from the active registry into
<BR>
a holding area to test for breaking something that is actually used, and to
<BR>
delete these entries when it is determined they are no longer needed.  Along
<BR>
those lines, there are registry profiles for components, system settings, file
<BR>
types and associations, MIME types and associations, etcetera.  Also, basically,
<BR>
there should be documentation of each and every registry key available.
<BR>
<P>Basically, I use an actually limited set of functions of the operating system.
<BR>
In a typical day's use, I will use five to ten applications, sometimes more, one
<BR>
or two of them Microsoft applications (mostly a compiler), and generally
<BR>
throughout the lifetime of this PC less than five hundred different
<BR>
applications, about ten of them from Microsoft, the large majority of which are
<BR>
installed by me.  I simply don't need or particularly want everything else and
<BR>
it is taking space on my storage and bad for security.
<BR>
<P>So, an adage is that using Windows (or Macintosh, in this regard) is like buying
<BR>
a car with the hood welded shut.  This is something where, as a very regular
<BR>
uesr of my PC, I want the option to change these settings, and to get,
<BR>
essentially, the service manual, so that I know what to change and why.
<BR>
<P>So, if Microsoft has better business practices and makes money and gains market
<BR>
share, good for them.  As not part of Microsoft, I don't care about that part.
<BR>
The issue is that there is the operating system to run the PC and provide what
<BR>
are generally accepted as &quot;system services&quot;, that is, hardware interface,
<BR>
input/output, GUI, network stack, rudimentary file management, anything above
<BR>
that is application software, where no matter who says what it is not so
<BR>
difficult to remove the association.
<BR>
<P>Well, as a user of this software for which money was indirectly tendered to
<BR>
Microsoft, I am the customer, and thus always right, and so want the source code
<BR>
to build my own compiler and kernel, and basic operating system services, and to
<BR>
be able to then pick and choose what operating system enhancements I find
<BR>
relevant, and then to pick and choose application software that best fits my own
<BR>
personal requirements.
<BR>
<P>When that day comes, then I will be able to verify the system security.
<BR>
<P>Well, that's my shred of verbiage for today.  Good day.
