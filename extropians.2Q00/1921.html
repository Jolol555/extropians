<EM>&gt; &gt;Additionally, there is no problem with making a runtime that disallows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(or allows the user to disallow) certain types of system functions, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as Java does. So the only security hole is due to the release of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;unready implementation. That is a typical Microsoft fault, premature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;releasing things. I'm sure that many of those suffering from Bill-envy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will extend that failure to his personal life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's quite a bit deeper than that. The ActiveX security philosophy is based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; authentication certificates - you trust the program because you know who the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; author was. In Java, you trust the program because it runs in an emulated sand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; box and can not possibly do things the vm won't let it do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What an ActiveX program can do isn't a function of the ActiveX runtime, it's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; function of what the operating system does when an executable program accesses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of the kernel interfaces. So far as I know, there's no system in Win95
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for running programs with some particular set of privileges.  Making ActiveX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programs as safe and flexible as Java programs would require a substantial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amount of operating system support, and it's a bit misleading to suggest 'the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only security hole is due to the release of an unready implementation.'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Windows is not incapable of priviledge levels or access restrictions. It
<BR>
is merely installed by the typical user without any. That is a matter of
<BR>
laziness rather than lack of capability. Any proper and secure ActiveX
<BR>
installation should allow you to set up such security (which would also
<BR>
alleviate a lot of the other security holes typical of windows use to
<BR>
access the internet.)
<BR>
<P>However, lets say you create a runtime to run ActiveX on a linux/unix
<BR>
environment. Because that environment specifically allows priviledge
<BR>
levels and access restrictions, you can build this capability into the
<BR>
runtime, such that it can interpret an ActiveX applet as being a user,
<BR>
group, or world level of access, and ban root from executing ActiveX.
