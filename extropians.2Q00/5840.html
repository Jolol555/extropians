The best place to live? (I'm including travel here) I think it's a matter of
<BR>
prerogative. Although some may long for the tropical sun to warm their
<BR>
skins, not an unusual request for the average journey of intrigue,
<BR>
especially permanent ones, others may be looking for something else. I of
<BR>
course (until my recent move to Seattle) was a L.A. born Ca. girl. I have
<BR>
had no extensive traveling outside of the U.S. (although much within) I have
<BR>
been just barely outside the border of both sides, Vancouver, Canada, and
<BR>
just barely into Mexico.
<BR>
Considering this, you can assume there are a zillion places I would like to
<BR>
experience. For example, I'd like to shop for Robots in Hong Kong, be the
<BR>
one with the foreign accent in Britain (eat chips, and wear dark clothes
<BR>
while walking on rainy pebble beaches), India: sitar's, mystical and ornate,
<BR>
Greece: home of Athens, from which sprang subsets of study. (Pythagoras,
<BR>
Plato, Socrates etc, etc.-btw could you imagine living in that time of
<BR>
thought!) Of course unrealistically speaking, I would like to have my own
<BR>
island (I used to plan for it when I was a kid, myself and my friend
<BR>
Kelly-don't ask what the males of our island. were there for! Whispering
<BR>
innocently~ just kidding, sort of) Well, if I'm going to go that for, I
<BR>
could just push the envelope and confess that since that time I have
<BR>
upgraded to desire for my own planet, aw, some day.
<BR>
Anyway, my point, I know, whew~ is, the place I would most like to go to,
<BR>
(although I don't know about live, because I don't have a lot to compare it
<BR>
with) is Iceland. I want to roam it's sprawling rocky terrain in big boots
<BR>
and a puffy white coat. The ice crunching beneath my feet as live volcanic
<BR>
steam rises to envelope my walk. I love the contradiction. I want to drive a
<BR>
big white jeep around, and embark to the top of some insanely, wind blown
<BR>
cliff. In my line of vision, hair, lava, and white snow. (okay I've said
<BR>
white three times now, I know it's not all white, as a matter of fact, it
<BR>
has some nice green jazz going on as well) Of course I am also up for living
<BR>
upstairs of my nanolab, or I'd even compromise for around the corner, or
<BR>
down the street. (I'll let ya know) Or how about travel in and out other
<BR>
peoples bodies, and where they live, like an exchange program. (anyone want
<BR>
to trade for a day?) How about outerspace, or in illogical places, like
<BR>
minds. (of course not to move in, just visit) VR for vacation as well?
<BR>
Where I really want to live, is far into the future, forever, where
<BR>
technology is my friend, and holds my hand (among other things) gracefully.
<BR>
A place where so many of today's plights have dissipated, where today's
<BR>
knowledge has exploded into life.

and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with the aid of a solar array you could even have electricity and thus
