<P><EM>&gt;Keep in mind that if his 'life's work' was on tapes that had been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;written years ago, on tapes that are a few decades old, there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a distinct chance of losing a good chunk of data in many places.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Some tapes of the older and lower quality types (esp dealing with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;9 track), are extremely hard to recover data off of after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;storage for many years even under the best of conditions. I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experienced dealing with poor quality tapes, some of which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;older than I am, and its no picnic. If the winding of the tape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;loosened at all, water would have seeped in between the tape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;material rather easily.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It can be done, but it is expensive.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mike's point is a good one. Any magnetically recorded item starts
<BR>
to degrade almost from the moment it's created and will need to be
<BR>
re-recorded periodically depending on the levels it was recorded at
<BR>
(key word hysteresis). Some formats are more notorious for this
<BR>
than others. A box of even regular 3.5 floppys kept under perfect
<BR>
conditions will degrade to useless over time. I forget the
<BR>
technical name for this.
<BR>
<P>Contacting the tapes manufacturer should provide appropriate data
<BR>
on this.
