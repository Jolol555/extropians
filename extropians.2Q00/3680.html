<P><EM>&gt; Speaking of Sweden...have you been to Vasteras? I have read that they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a heating system under the streets to melt the snow. Does it work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well? 
</EM><BR>
<P>I have not seen that system, but similar things are in place here and
<BR>
there. The problem is that the range of snow and temperatures where it
<BR>
is useful is somewhat limited: either there is no snow, enough snow to
<BR>
melt, or too much snow so that you instead end up with is a big area
<BR>
of hazardous water or ice, and the &quot;enough&quot; range appears to be small
<BR>
enough in our current climate that the idea seldom pays for
<BR>
itself. Naturally, it also eats enormous amounts of energy, making it
<BR>
troublesome whenever funding for public works get cut or the energy
<BR>
prices rise.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That is an example of an automated system to substitute for human.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not unpleasant or chaotic (if it works). And how about &quot;moving sidewalks&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another example of automation.
</EM><BR>
<P>They are a good example of just why much automaton fails in real
<BR>
life. Notice that they are rather uncommon - old sf predicted moving
<BR>
sidewalks in the streets and just about everywhere, but we only find
<BR>
them in airports, malls, here and there in the Stockholm subway
<BR>
etc. Controlled indoors environments with specific uses. Implementing
<BR>
a robustly working versions for other environments have proved too
<BR>
expensive and inconvenient.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In fact the whole internal transportation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system could be automated ... safe, pollution-free. Villages designed this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way could be linked by inter-village transportation methods, also safe and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pollution-free. People can leave their cars on the city perimeter.
</EM><BR>
<P>This idea is old, I think Disney wanted it at Epcot. The problem is
<BR>
that the internal transportation systems envisioned seldom took into
<BR>
account how and where people *really* wanted to move, had lots of
<BR>
moving parts that could snag or break, had high maintenance costs and
<BR>
could not adapt easily if things changed (such as shifts in load or
<BR>
socio-geography). If you look at modern books in city planning you will see
<BR>
that such schemes are today criticized as being the epitome of the
<BR>
technocratic form of city planning, and there are usually examples
<BR>
describing just how wrong these projects went.
<BR>
<P>I think self-organisation is much better. We need systems that can
<BR>
adapt/be adapted to the users, where new ideas can be tested by people
<BR>
individually without any need for strong central control or risking
<BR>
the entire network crashing. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It could get pretty nighmarish if the humans who start the GA's off don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; put them on the right path.
</EM><BR>
<P>My experience is that GAs seldom do what you want them to do. In the
<BR>
cases where you can set them on the right path the problem is usually
<BR>
so simple it can be solved by hand.
