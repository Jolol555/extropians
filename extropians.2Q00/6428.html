Hi!

<EM>&gt;damage to the brain do you think might be caused by the

<EM>&gt;failure of the aging body supporting the brain rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the aging of the brain itself?  In other words, if we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only replace the body, and lack a way to treat the brain,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how far will this get us?
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the major failures of gerontology has been in cornering where are
<BR>
the causes of aging located. For example: Does aging originate in the
<BR>
brain, the immune system, or all organs? Does aging originate in
<BR>
post-mitotic cells or mitotic cells? Does aging originate in errors in
<BR>
translation, transcription, the DNA itself, or none of these? Does aging
<BR>
originate in the nucleus, the mitochondria, or other organell? Personally,
<BR>
I don't think the basic causes of aging are present in all cells of all
<BR>
organs of the body. The question is where?
<BR>
<P>Answering your question, if aging is located in a single organ, then the
<BR>
brain is probably the main candidate (e.g. Sacher's equations show a
<BR>
stronger correlation using the brain). If aging is caused by senescence in
<BR>
mitotic tissues then you would expect a diminished decline of the brain if
<BR>
you avoid aging in the body. Obviously, if aging has its origin in some
<BR>
organ, tissue or system not part of the brain, then you would avoid aging.
<BR>
However, you must have in mind that many age-related pathologies (e.g.
<BR>
Alzheimer, Creutzfeld-Jakob, Parkinson, Machado-Joseph, to mention just
<BR>
brain age-related pathologies) are probably independant of aging and would
<BR>
appear even if you were to eradicate aging (from evolutionary theory, it is
<BR>
logical that if lifespan does not exceed 120 then lethal mutations acting
<BR>
at late ages can accumulate in all organs; but these are pathologies, not
<BR>
basic causes of aging). I have a few paragraphs in my website addressing
<BR>
your particular question
