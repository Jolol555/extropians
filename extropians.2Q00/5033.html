<P>It is none of my business who you looek for but I will tell you this: 
<BR>
<P>I find this so statement so EMPTY headed, nasty, sexist, bigoted, 
<BR>
unenlightened, uninformed, abusive, crude,  harsh ...inferior of thought and 
<BR>
mind.... not to mention horrible...  that I am actually going to killfile 
<BR>
you. I have never EVER killfiled anyone on this list, since I believe that 
<BR>
even offensive, bigoted and stupid people have something I can learn from. 
<BR>
<P>You obviously own not one shred of respect for women, men, for the list, or 
<BR>
for yourself.
<BR>
<P>If I meet you at an event that Max and Natasha put on, I will be embarrased.
