<EM>&gt; &gt; Consider this hypothetical situation: group A and group B have a dispute.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; After the fact, group A is dead, while at some point when they more alive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; group B was armed with armored tanks and automatic weapons and was in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the state of assaulting group A.  The consistency of group A was a set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of civilians and group B military.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Later some people who are still alive decide to have a simulation and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; see what they can determine about the facts as they occurred.  Group B
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; runs all aspects of the simulation without oversight, where group B's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; goal is to show certain things.  What conclusions do you expect to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; apparent from group B's simulation?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Don't forget, the plaintiffs (Waco survivors and heirs) have lawyers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as well.  The test was originally proposed by the plaintiffs and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terms were agreed to by them.  I believe they also agreed upon the firm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to conduct the analysis (unfortunately I suspect the only organizations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with experience in this kind of analysis have military or law enforcement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ties because those groups are the main users of this technology).

<P>Of the circumstance that the plaintiff agreed to the terms of a simulation
<BR>
without having some of their proposed terms denied, or to the analysts, I was
<BR>
not aware, not do I particularly think that either situation would change the
<BR>
capability of group B to appropriate or alter the results of the simulation.
<BR>
Media access was highly restricted.  Can one get copies of the actual 93 and
<BR>
simulation footage today to compare for themselves?
<BR>
<P>There just seems to be too many loose ends in this hypothetical situation, and
<BR>
eighty dead non-combatant men, women, and children.  Perhaps among the most
<BR>
damning facts is the fact that the government has modified and deleted
<BR>
evidence, and been found in lies over the course of the investigation, most
<BR>
strikingly in regards to the use of incendiary devices by the invading force, a
<BR>
lie being a falsehood knowingly made.
<BR>
<P>I can't say much more than that:  I wasn't there.  Media access was restricted,
<BR>
and so the only ones that were there that live can be ordered into silence.
<BR>
Where is the survivors' testimony?  They could take polygraphs of their own
<BR>
volition and largely clear the air.  It's not my wheel to grind, it just seems
<BR>
obvious that something wrong happened at Mt. Carmel.
<BR>
<P>It's sad, regardless.  From this time forward let there not be government
<BR>
imposed force on its citizens without the entirety of the citizens able to
<BR>
watch the proceedings, and the turmoil surrounding the results would not
<BR>
reoccur.
