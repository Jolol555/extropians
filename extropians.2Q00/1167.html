This is a repost from Cryonet that tells the experiences of a Russian 
<BR>
cryonicist, Mikhail Soloviev, who is trying to get things started over there 
<BR>
and create a positive stir in the mass media.  He has had some real 
<BR>
successes along with serious frustration.  I think this is a fascinating 
<BR>
story that is well worth reading.

Subject: Cryonics in the Russian mass-media
<BR>
<P>[This message is a version (slightly edited) of the article
<BR>
published in The Immortalist, Jan.-Feb. 2000.]
<BR>
Cryonics in the Russian mass-media
<BR>
by Mikhail Soloviev
<BR>
<P>For some years my attempts to attract attention of the Russian
<BR>
mass-media to cryonics had moderate success. In 1997 my
<BR>
article &quot;Nanotechnology -- a key for immortality and freedom&quot;
<BR>
was published in a popular computer weekly &quot;Computerra&quot;. The
<BR>
article was followed by a discussion about the use of
<BR>
immortality -- of course, the dominant opinion was: it is useless.
<BR>
<P>In 1998 cryonics was featured in my article &quot;Technocrats'
<BR>
Hopes&quot; published in a national weekly &quot;Common Newspaper&quot;. On
<BR>
the same page academician (geneticist) Yuri Altukhov argued
<BR>
that immortality is impossible. It is worth mention, however,
<BR>
that in a recent article published in a very popular national
<BR>
daily newspaper &quot;News&quot; (&quot;Izvestia&quot;) another academician
<BR>
(biochemist) Vladimir Skulachev (both these academicians are
<BR>
among the most known and influential scientists in Russia)
<BR>
said that immortality is possible, desirable, and inevitable
<BR>
(he meant anti-aging gene engineering, not cryonics).
<BR>
<P>In the end of 1998 I resumed my attempts to convince a known
<BR>
St. Petersburg journalist Arkady Sosnov (whom I knew since
<BR>
1996) to write an article on the subject. He needed several
<BR>
months to produce it, but its publication in the main
<BR>
academician weekly &quot;Search&quot; (April 1999) had a real effect --
<BR>
the Russian journalists noticed the existence of cryonics.
<BR>
<P>Soon I was contacted by the editor of the scientific
<BR>
department of the top national newspaper for businessmen
<BR>
&quot;Commersant&quot; and asked to write an article on cryonics. It was
<BR>
published in July in the form of an interview with me
<BR>
(illustrated by 2 photos from Alcor's web site). Almost all
<BR>
aspects of cryonics were mentioned there: the nature of
<BR>
freezing damage, the need for nanotechnology to repair the
<BR>
damaged cells, who and why of wanting to be immortal, how to
<BR>
get your money back after reanimation, current research on
<BR>
vitrification, etc. Later this big and detailed article was
<BR>
reprinted in some regional newspapers. In October other very
<BR>
popular national newspaper &quot;The Komsomol Truth&quot; (&quot;Komsomol&quot; is
<BR>
translated as &quot;Young Communists' League&quot; -- this newspaper
<BR>
kept its name from Soviet times, but now it has no connections
<BR>
with the Soviet type of communism) produced its own article on
<BR>
cryonics based on my publication in &quot;Commersant&quot; and other
<BR>
materials from my web site &quot;Immortality through freezing --
<BR>
Cryonics in Russia&quot; (<A HREF="http://cryonics.euro.ru">http://cryonics.euro.ru</A>).
<BR>
<P>In this year
<BR>
two interviews with me (&quot;The Freezers&quot; and &quot;Our Children will
<BR>
be Immortal&quot;) appeared in January in a national trade-union
<BR>
newspaper &quot;Labor&quot; (this and most other Russian nation-wide
<BR>
newspapers have circulation between 1 and 2 million). All
<BR>
these articles were not accompanied by anti-cryonics comments,
<BR>
the style of comments was rather neutral, or a little bit ironic.
<BR>
<P>The latest publication were in English -- it was written by a
<BR>
journalist from &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; (English-language
<BR>
newspaper) and printed in &quot;Business Review&quot; (a kind of monthly
<BR>
application to &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; for foreign businessmen
<BR>
working in Russia). I got the permission to reprint it in The
<BR>
Immortalist and post it to the Cryonet (I'll do it later).
<BR>
<P>Before the publication in &quot;Commersant&quot; only our local St.
<BR>
Petersburg TV channels featured cryonics (3 of them showed
<BR>
interviews with me). But in September the leading Russian TV
<BR>
channel ORT (&quot;The 1st Channel&quot; or &quot;Public Russian Television&quot;)
<BR>
invited some Russian cryonicists to participate in the daily
<BR>
noon 40-minutes show &quot;Good Day&quot;, where we (medical computer
<BR>
scientists Igor Artyuhov, rock-musician and writer Vladimir
<BR>
Rekshan, businessman Dmitry Sannikov, and me) argued that
<BR>
cryonics is a real option.The fragments from Discovery Channel's documentary 
<BR>
&quot;Immortality on Ice&quot; was shown to demonstrate the cryonics
<BR>
practice and feasibility of nanotechnological repair of
<BR>
damaged cells (these fragments were selected and translated by
<BR>
me).
<BR>
<P>There were 2 other participants in this show --
<BR>
physicians who never heard of cryonics before and they mainly
<BR>
spoke about their own problems (they work in the reanimation-
<BR>
related fields of medicine). One of the spectators, who called
<BR>
to the studio during this broadcast, offered to use her body
<BR>
for freezing experiments. We also answered many other
<BR>
questions, though many of them were rather stupid.
<BR>
<P>In November I was contacted by a very popular reporter from
<BR>
other national TV channel (NTV) Elena Masyuk (once she and her
<BR>
team were captured by the Chechen terrorists and were freed
<BR>
for several millions dollars). She was influenced by the
<BR>
article in &quot;The Komsomol Truth&quot; and decided to make a
<BR>
documentary on cryonics.
<BR>
<P>Her team visited Robert Ettinger, the
<BR>
Cryonics Institute, and Trans Time. In January they
<BR>
interviewed me and Yuri Pichugin. I explained my project
<BR>
&quot;Cryofarm&quot; and some scenarios for nanotechnological repair, my
<BR>
wife had a long and expressive speech in support of cryonics,
<BR>
our daughter (11 years old) took the position of social
<BR>
Darwinism (surprisingly to me) and reasoned about the possible
<BR>
bad sides of the future.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately only few my words were
<BR>
included in the final broadcast (40 minutes, shown on a Friday
<BR>
evening), the speeches of my wife and daughter were excluded,
<BR>
and besides me only our cat was shown as a prospective
<BR>
cryonics patient. Yuri was also shown very shortly. Instead
<BR>
much time was devoted to an old (of the 60s) Soviet film &quot;The
<BR>
Escape of Mr. McKinly&quot;, where the idea of immortality (through
<BR>
the conservation in colloid gas) was interpreted as an
<BR>
extremely stupid thing.
<BR>
<P>The only good feature of this
<BR>
broadcast was the interview with Robert Ettinger, who
<BR>
explained simple, but still very actual things (as they are
<BR>
poorly understood by many people) -- that life is good, and
<BR>
death is bad. Of course, many interesting technical details of
<BR>
cryonics procedure were demonstrated, but because of the lack
<BR>
of scientific background the cryonicists looked like naive
<BR>
believers.
<BR>
<P>I think such accent of the broadcast could be
<BR>
explained by the personal attitude of Elena, who told me she
<BR>
didn't like the idea of cryonics and was very surprised by my love to all 
<BR>
people.
<BR>
<P>I don't wait an immediate response to be resulted from this
<BR>
interest of mass-media and clearly understand that the
<BR>
possible effect is rather cumulative. Anyway I think that the
<BR>
Russian immortalists could have a chance for immortality even
<BR>
at our present resources -- we could start by organizing a
<BR>
kind of social network to provide the brain embalming after
<BR>
deanimation. Later, if our resources grow, such social network
<BR>
evolves into a &quot;full-blooded&quot; cryonics organization (this idea
<BR>
is described in my project &quot;Latmos&quot;, which I'll post later).
