<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Microsoft _can_ side-step an EU anti-trust investigation -- all they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to do is stop selling Windows anywhere in the EU, at which point they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; aren't a monopoly any more. If they _want_ to sell Windows in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; environment ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So if MS only sells to the euro market via internet downloads.... what possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; actions can the eu countries take?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Several, without even insisting that all European ISPs block Microsoft's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; web sites.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They can issue a court order for damages. If a criminal offense is found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have happened -- such as a conviction for bribery -- they can issue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an extradition warrant and the US government _will_ cooperate with that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (as a quid pro quo for delivering fugitive American criminals back to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their own jurisdiction).
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so. Extradition warrants only apply if the actual individual
<BR>
committed the actual crime (AND it has to be a crime that is on the
<BR>
treaty) in european jurisdiction, and the individual fled that
<BR>
jurisdiction. And considering how well you europeans obey the
<BR>
extradition treaties we do have (Ira Einhorn ring a bell?) for real
<BR>
crimes, I don't think its very freaking likely we'll be shipping anybody
<BR>
over there soon to answer to the socialist peoples re-education and
<BR>
property re-distribution court system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They can ban the use of Microsoft products from all government and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government funded organisations -- right down to the file format
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level. It'll hurt in the short term, but what do you think the long-term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prospects would be for Corel, Apple, Red Hat, if suddenly Microsoft was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; banned from European government bureacracies? It'd knock a major plank
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out from the raft of network externalities that shore up Microsoft's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retail sales base.
</EM><BR>
<P>Considering that europe is far more dependent upon US high tech than we
<BR>
are dependent upon europe, you'd be cutting your own throats to do
<BR>
something like that, and we'd be laughing all the way to the bank.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moreover, some of Microsoft's products aren't downloadable over the web.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Knock out the MCSE training/certification network in Europe and qualified
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support for Microsoft's remaining products would dwindle.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like you folks have got a nice totalitarian socialist big brother
<BR>
system set up and running to accomplish all this. Figures.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; None of this would amount to decreeing that some other supplier of choice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would take over from Microsoft; it merely amounts to the point that it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult to sell to a hostile market, and the EU governments would suddenly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become such a market, and a lot of the non-governmental sector would follow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their lead.
</EM><BR>
<P>Until it became too expensive to trade in a Windows world using
<BR>
Socialistsoft Curtains(tm)...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Quite possibly, knowing the French ... but remember, Microsoft is behaving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; extra-territorially. In the event, I expect they'll just lock up the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; directors of Microsoft's French subsidiary, and/or fine the company, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe put out an extradition warrant for Bill.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not the worlds biggest fan of Bill Gates, but even I can tell you that if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; French try something like this, its gonna piss off a lot of Americans.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The French government pisses off a lot of people here, too (but sometimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their ability to insounciantly get right up a deserving nostril earns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them fans).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Rest of world != China. Plus, they hardly have a monopoly on it -- they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; merely steal the most of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I merely used them as an example, as I had hoped you could comprehend by the simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; English. Any higher rates for software elsewhere in the world are because of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; following:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a) added cost of language customization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then why does Windows cost 50% more in the UK? Where piracy levels are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; zip and there's no import tarrif? (That's the pre-tax cost, BTW.)
</EM><BR>
<P>You obviously don't understand the actual taxes that go on at the
<BR>
various levels of distribution and pre-sales. Additionally, there IS
<BR>
significant language customization for even UK versions of windows.
<BR>
There is US English and UK English. Surely you know this....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clue: Microsoft's grip on the UK market is even tighter than its grip in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the US -- the Mac platform never caught on over here.
</EM><BR>
<P>My cousin who went to Oxford says that Mac is huge there.
