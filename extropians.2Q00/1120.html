</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;While I am very big on individual self defense, I have come to abhor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;state-sponsored killing in general.  As things currently stand in most if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;not all countries, the state is not held to the same standards of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;justifiable homicide as the individual.  While creating such a standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;effectively eliminates the death penalty, in the absence of such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;standard I would prefer to explicitly eliminate this ability from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;state.  Arguably, only individuals can have the right of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;self-defense anyway, since the government is made up of nothing more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;individuals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sounds nice.  But the minute you hold the state to the same standard as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individuals, the state gives up all police power (except in those few 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumstances were governmental employees or property are harmed or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threatened) and all prisons must be emptied.  That might sound like a good 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing to you, but the day it happens here is the day I move to Costa Rica.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I am not saying that the state should lose police power and it doesn't
<BR>
follow that the prisons should be emptied; I am saying that the state
<BR>
should be held to the same standard of accountability as individuals. 
<BR>
There is a pretty big difference.  An easy example is the number of people
<BR>
who are killed every week in the U.S. by state agents simply because the
<BR>
state made a &quot;mistake&quot; or had an &quot;accident&quot; that would have resulted in
<BR>
murder charges had the people involved been private citizens.  This, to
<BR>
me, is unacceptable.  I've lost track of the number of times police have
<BR>
kicked in the door of someone's house, killed some or all of the people
<BR>
inside, and then determined that they had the wrong address or that the
<BR>
person they were looking for wasn't even there.  The worst that typically
<BR>
happens is a civil suit paid with your tax dollars, so there is no
<BR>
incentive for them to change their behavior.
<BR>
<P>The only protection offered against illegitimate use of deadly force in
<BR>
the U.S. is to kill the state agents/police at the time the incident
<BR>
occurs.  The majority of the time, the police bring overwhelming force, so
<BR>
that if they do kill you there is only one side of the story anyway.  In
<BR>
other words, you can either capitulate and hope that you are not killed
<BR>
anyway (as sometimes happens) or lawfully resist and get killed. 
<BR>
Something is very wrong with that picture.  I have a hard time with the
<BR>
fact that the state can kill an individual with effective impunity for
<BR>
exercising a legally recognized right.  (It is interesting to note that
<BR>
there have been a few times where a homeowner successfully drove off an
<BR>
illegitimate police assault with a hail of gun fire.  These cases are
<BR>
essentially always deemed to be justifiable by the courts.)
<BR>
<P>What I am getting at, is that allowing this type of behavior by the state
<BR>
as it currently exists gives the state carte blanche to &quot;accidentally&quot;
<BR>
kill anyone they don't like without any consequences to the individuals
<BR>
involved in the killing.  This is a Bad Thing and can easily lead to a
<BR>
Disneyland police state.
