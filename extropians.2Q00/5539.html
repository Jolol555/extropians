<EM>&gt; &gt; How so?  If you're putting forth the squirrel case that Robert Stirling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; was himself a product of evolution, well then *everything* made by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; humans is a product of evolution.  A tautology of zero value.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I am, and yes, it is tautology.  So is all of mathematics, but that does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not make it of zero value.
</EM><BR>
<P>The meta level still doesn't make the program in question capable of
<BR>
making design innovations, and is useless in the context.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is common for folks to make the mental error of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; separating the &quot;works of man&quot; from the &quot;works of nature.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but we were discussing the &quot;works of a design evolution program&quot;,
<BR>
running without intervention by man.  Human works added to the program
<BR>
would not be evolution within that system, but would be an external deus
<BR>
ex machina plunking the program down in a new parameter space.
<BR>
<P>That program can evolve deisel engines all you want, and it won't come
<BR>
up with a stirling cycle.  If it includes a turbocharger, it could
<BR>
possibly evolve through a Nene-like stage (a big turbocharged deisel
<BR>
design of the 1950s) into a jet engine... but the program, as written,
<BR>
will not invent new methods on its own.  Of course, if the programmer
<BR>
throws in a regenerator, displacer piston, and heat exchangers (along
<BR>
with the analytical models to predict their behavior), the system might
<BR>
converge on a useful stirling design- but it could not make that leap on
<BR>
its own.
<BR>
<P>Currently available software can do evolutionary design optimization,
<BR>
but cannot make major jumps to new technologies.  Useful, yes, but not
<BR>
universally versatile.  Creative design input is still required.
