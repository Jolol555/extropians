<EM>&gt; &gt; Saying that lawyers have a &quot;monopoly&quot; on the practice of law is like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  that licensed drivers have a monopoly on driving.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have pretty mixed feelings about what I believe is in fact a state-backed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;monopoly - i.e. the professional bar.  On the one hand, I think 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;state-backed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;monopolies are bad.  On the other, allowing just anybody to hold themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out as an attorney would seriously corrode the rule of law.  Consider that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one of the fundamental values underpinning the rule of law is that people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;must be bound by the judicial process.  Mandating some minimal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certification
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for attorneys enhances this value, since it makes it more fair to bind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone who is represented by counsel.  &gt;The system we now have evolved 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from each court or court system regulating its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;own bar, with essentially local &quot;legal elders&quot; administering bar 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;examinations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on behalf of the courts in a pretty decentralized fashion.  Criteria for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;taking the exam were highly flexible and consisted primarily of sponsorship
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by a known and respected member of the bar.  One of the founders of my firm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;didn't attend law school, but &quot;read law&quot; in the old fashioned way as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;working apprentice in the profession under this system.  He must have done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well, since he was Jesse Jones' personal attorney (Jones going on to own a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good chunk of coastal Texas, create one of the largest charitable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;foundations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the world and become Secretary of Commerce).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Likewise, before the unification of the old diverse subject-matter court
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;systems, the various lines of judicial authority maintained their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idiosyncratic bar admission and regulatory systems.  The law courts, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chancery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;courts and admiralty boards each had separate bars, with specialized 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;criteria
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for admission, in many places in the Anglosphere well into this century.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was a rare lawyer indeed who was both a proctor in admiralty and an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attorney
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at law before 1900, for instance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The old system worked fairly well and could be a model for a more flexible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;polycentric&quot; professional bar.  Getting to such a result would require us 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;let go of the &quot;stasist&quot; paradigm of state-centered centralization that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;characterized much of the legal-systemic thinking of the 20th century.  But 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't think I could ever support a complete &quot;deprofessionalization&quot; of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;practice of law.  A life in the law is just that, and can't be something 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;does without a fairly deep personal commitment, at least not without doing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;grave disservice to anyone who would look to you for help in navigating the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;web of legal responsibility.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>I suggest that you check out the &quot;missing 13th Amendment.&quot;  In brief, there 
<BR>
was a different 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which was 
<BR>
apparently passed and was on the books of many state governments as the U.S. 
<BR>
Constitution for many decades in the first half of the 19th Century.  The 
<BR>
missing 13th would basically have outlawed the bar as it stands.
<BR>
<P>It would have also torpedoed the attempts by the very large and powerful 
<BR>
legal teams out of Britain to secure the enormous U.S. assets held by 
<BR>
various British interests, after the 1776 revolution.  They were allegedly 
<BR>
systematically infiltrating and taking over the U.S. via the legal 
<BR>
profession and political payoffs.  The 13th was supposedly a deliberate 
<BR>
political answer to this.
<BR>
<P>So, right after the 13th was passed the British invade and burn the capitol, 
<BR>
including the federal records - including the ratification paperwork.
<BR>
<P>Interesting that a private organization - the state bar - is able to dictate 
<BR>
who can be - not just an attorney - but also a judge.  Such a surprise that 
<BR>
the courts never tried to investigate whether the 13th had in fact been 
<BR>
ratified...
