<P>I understand this, but you are presuming some real &quot;cost&quot; associated
<BR>
with the $100K.  If I'm paying for the suspension with insurance dollars
<BR>
then the cost is discounted depending on whether I'm frozen before
<BR>
I've vested my $100K.  Or if you are a very wealthy individual (as
<BR>
two potential cryonics candidates I knew were), then the $100K is
<BR>
discounted even more because its money at the margin where the tradeoffs
<BR>
are not in &quot;personal survival&quot; but in &quot;perceived quality of life&quot; issues.
<BR>
<P>Now, if you have children, college educations, etc. to worry about, then
<BR>
I would agree that the $100K may not be insignificant and you would want
<BR>
higher confidence that cryonics would work.  But since since many people
<BR>
(with exceptions on the list noted) involved in cryonics are not
<BR>
particularly religious, the funds invested in cryonics could otherwise
<BR>
be looked at as funds you would donate to your church.  In that respect
<BR>
voting for cryonics vs. religion as an insurance policy on an afterlife
<BR>
seems to favor cryonics with little relative lifestyle sacrifice vis-a-vis
<BR>
others in similar positions in your community choosing the religious
<BR>
insurance approach.  Its only if you choose cryonics *and* religion
<BR>
as insurance policies that you have to sacrifice someplace else.
<BR>
<P>Assuming being revived from cryonic suspension, means a nanotech era where
<BR>
diseases are solved and the accident rate allows you to live 2000-5000 years
<BR>
in a nanosanta world (when a year then is *more* valuable than a year now
<BR>
because you don't have to work to survive), what would the success chances
<BR>
have to be to justify the $100K?  (If required, assume you are suspended
<BR>
for 50 years, which seems about right.)
