I probably shouldn't go on about this since Max posted, but what the hey..

<EM>&gt; &gt; ... If you call yourself a member of a philosophy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that has a specific list of principles, and yet you do not agree with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them all, then as you say it is a simple tautology that you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not actually a member of that philosophy, and continuing to use the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; term to describe yourself is either self-deceptive or insulting to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You really should read beyond the first sentence of my reply, and if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you did, do it again with more effort in understanding.  How do we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know that it's not /you/ who misunderstands or misinterprets the basic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; principles, while I'm the &quot;real&quot; Extropian?  We don't until we examine
</EM><BR>
<P>The argument I am making is a special case where someone openly admits
<BR>
that they do not agree with one of the principles. I am not judging
<BR>
anyone, I am making a conclusion based on their own admissions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; it.  How do we know the principles themselves don't contain internal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inconsistencies theat further discussion will bring to light?  Those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who bring up such issues are doing the real work of thought, and are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not deceiving themselves or others in any way.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well this is probably where we are really differing. I am trying to
<BR>
get across the idea that it doesn't matter at all whether the principles
<BR>
are &quot;right&quot;. They can be completely goofy, such as with religions.
<BR>
But if you are calling yourself a member of that philosophy then you
<BR>
are implying that you agree with the principles.
<BR>
<P>What it seems to come down to is: do you think extropianism is what
<BR>
is defined by Max with his principles, or do you think what really
<BR>
matters is each person's own definition?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Don't mistake me for an &quot;inclusionist&quot; who thinks philosophies should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be watered down to gain following--I'm just the opposite.  I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophies should be clarified and their implications examined in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detail; if other philosophies break from them, that's good too.  I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think there are those who may deceptively label themselves with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophy they don't actually hold, but I do not for a moment think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it is easy to determine which those are, apart from those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; honestly believe they do espouse the philosophy though they may have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disagreements about details with others.  I am not so juvenile to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think simple black-and-white lines can be drawn easily.
