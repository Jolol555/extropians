<P>
Thought this would interest the list----Brian
<BR>
<P><P><P>Friends:
<BR>
<P>This is an introduction to Greenstar; we
<BR>
identified you as someone who is interested in
<BR>
solar power, renewable energy, and in furthering
<BR>
balanced economic development around the world --
<BR>
growth which gives voice to traditional cultures,
<BR>
respects human rights, and preserves the
<BR>
environment.
<BR>
<P>We have two living laboratories in progress in
<BR>
a small Palestinian village in the Middle East,
<BR>
and in a rural village in the hills of Jamaica,
<BR>
which I believe may interest you.
<BR>
<P>We're trying to demonstrate that a co-ordinated
<BR>
package of solar power, health and education,
<BR>
telecommunications and ecommerce can provide an
<BR>
off-the-grid community with the tools it needs to
<BR>
transform itself, and to reach economic independence.
<BR>
<P>As the foundation of an ecommerce business for
<BR>
the village, we have developed original art and music
<BR>
in this village, and are now offering it on the Web.
<BR>
The income goes directly into development projects
<BR>
designed by the village.
<BR>
<P>Twenty original Bedouin musical pieces and
<BR>
eighteen pieces created in Swift River, Jamaica,
<BR>
can be heard at:
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>And you can also see the artwork created by
<BR>
the people of the small Palestinian village for
<BR>
Greenstar:

<BR>
<P><P>The San Jose Mercury-News ran a story in a recent
<BR>
edition, after a visit to the West Bank by
<BR>
one of their reporters. It says, in part:
<BR>
<P>&quot;This is so important for us,&quot; said the village's
<BR>
English teacher, Suleiman Najada, who now
<BR>
uses a computer to print out test papers and to
<BR>
look up information for the first time in his
<BR>
career. &quot;We are very far from the world. But
<BR>
now we feel like we are at the center of the
<BR>
world.&quot;
<BR>

<BR>
article can be seen at:

<P>Two current newsletters can be seen at:

<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.greenstar.org/Jan00-Update/">http://www.greenstar.org/Jan00-Update/</A>
<BR>
<P><P>We are preparing to scale this model to other
<BR>
countries in the Middle East and the Caribbean,
<BR>
and to other regions of the world. Expressions
<BR>
of interest in partnering with Greenstar have
<BR>
come in from over 30 countries.
<BR>
<P>Our next projects will be in Tanzania, Egypt and
<BR>
Nepal.
<BR>
<P><P>We are actively seeking partners who wish to develop
<BR>
renewable energy, telecommunications and ecommerce
<BR>
activities in all regions of the developing world, and
<BR>
welcome any questions or ideas from you. Please feel
<BR>
free to forward this note to others of like mind.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to send you periodic updates on Greenstar,
<BR>
wholly without obligation of course. If you prefer not
<BR>
to receive the Greenstar newsletter, you may send
<BR>
a blank email to unsubscribe@greenstar.org.
