<P><EM>&gt;And here we have the phenomenon that bothers me most about the Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;case.  The theories behind current antitrust law are about as thoroughly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discredited as anything in economics ever gets.  Natural monopolies may or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;may not actually be possible, but they are definitely far less common than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most people seem to think.  In the MS case the government doesn't even have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that excuse - they're reduced to saying &quot;Microsoft is really big, and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plays hardball, so that must mean it has some kind of unfair advantage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;somehow, and we should stop them&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem is that the government's arguments for Microsoft's supposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unfair advantage are an incoherent jumble of discredited theories and naive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nonsense.  Microsoft is in the same position as any major company in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;competitive field - they look really intimidating until they screw up, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then they fall on their faces just as fast as the little guys.
</EM><BR>

<BR>
I appreciate the argument that monopolies are unstable - maybe that's
<BR>
so. It's a punctuated equilibrium model - a stable looking
<BR>
configuration can spontaneously shatter and something totally
<BR>
unexpected and new can replace it. On the other hand, maybe a monopoly
<BR>
is a kind of local maximum - a bottom up economic optimization system
<BR>
gets stuck and it needs to be perterbed from outside before it can get
<BR>
going again. What does seem clear though is that, presently, there's a
<BR>
problem.  Whether government intervention is necessary or beneficial
<BR>
is a separate question. Maybe, left alone, the market will change and
<BR>
the situation will resolve itself - or maybe we can save 20 years of
<BR>
stagnation by stepping in and doing something about it now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Microsoft got where it is by giving its customers what they wanted.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instant they cease to do so, someone else will step forward and take away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their market.  The actions the government is accusing Microsoft of taking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are all perfectly normal business practices, which would not merit a raised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eyebrow in any rational legal system. The whole case is simply a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;companies that don't want to bother competing in the market crying for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government to stamp out competition for them.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is an over simplification. If Microsoft gains a competitive
<BR>
advantage from control of the Windows platform, rather than because
<BR>
they're offering a better product, then superior products will fail
<BR>
for reason irrelevant to their quality. I would like to see an
<BR>
environment where products succeed on their own merits, not because
<BR>
their maker controls the distribution channel or a proprietary
<BR>
standard. For instance, I'd like to see a public operating system
<BR>
specification - something like Posix - and a law prohibiting
<BR>
government agencies from purchasing operating systems that do not
<BR>
conform to that standard or buying application software which doesn't
<BR>
run on some minimalist public reference implementation. Vendors could
<BR>
than compete and differentiate themselves on the basis of efficiency,
<BR>
robustness, etc, of their particular version.
