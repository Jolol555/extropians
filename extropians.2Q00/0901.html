<EM>&gt; &gt; It goes on to discuss how you could engineer methods to allow humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to tolerate higher G forces.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robert Im thinking we could emerse the astronauts for a half a minute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in water during launch, at which time they could take 40 g for 12 seconds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plus about 15 negative g for about another few seconds as they decelerated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of the atmosphere.  The track length would need to be about 29 km
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the velocity left over after atmopheric deceleration would still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amount to ~4 km/sec at which time rockets would need to take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over to accelerate to orbital velocity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The emersion technique would probably not be comfortable but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think it would be survivable.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>These are possible systems. A local company, Creare, is doing
<BR>
hyperoxidized fluid breathing system research (as seen in the movie _The
<BR>
Abyss_) for the Air Force. The difficulty with this technology is
<BR>
getting people to be at all useful once they've 'drowned'. It typically
<BR>
requires some serious training to keep the people from having serious
<BR>
panic attacks that retain some PTSD effects afterward. Now, the G limits
<BR>
are definitely something that is only necessary if your occupants are
<BR>
going to be actively  involved in the piloting of the vehicle, which is
<BR>
not necessary. The I think 13 g limits the Air Force uses are measures
<BR>
of intermittent g tolerance to retain conciousness. Automated piloting
<BR>
obviates the need for concious occupants.
<BR>
<P>If you are using rockets after exiting the tube, are you not countering
<BR>
the negative 15 g's somewhat? Additionally, could you not use the laser
<BR>
propulsion system to fire some bursts ahead of the vehicle prior to
<BR>
exiting the tube to cause the air to expand outward due to thermal
<BR>
shock, temporarily creating a bit of a vacuum tube in the air? If this
<BR>
were possible you'd get less drag induced decelleration, though I'm sure
<BR>
you'd need some good 3d thermal imaging to plot it out to prevent it
<BR>
from adding to turbulence...
