Good effort Ziana. They don't mention that if the registered owner isn't 
<BR>
home and his wife gets attacked by a rapist/robber/murderer, she has no hope 
<BR>
of defending herself or the kids. So you buy your wife a gun, fine.  Your 
<BR>
kids, who under such circumstances are most likely to not be theobject of 
<BR>
immediate attention, actually have a very good chance of being the ones to 
<BR>
retreive either weapon, neither of which they can use. Smartguns are for 
<BR>
dumb people.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Could a 'supersmart' gun be designed that has two or more people that are 
<BR>
able to use it?  Both a husband and wife?  That would solve much of the 
<BR>
problem.
<BR>
<P>Of course in a situation where the parents are already dead or incapacitated 
<BR>
and the ten year-old son picks up the gun from the floor after a major 
<BR>
struggle and the criminal is almost on him, there would be a problem.  This 
<BR>
would be a rare and worst case scenario.

<EM>&gt;Mike, you can't imagine how wildly weird this sort of thing sounds &gt;in Oz.

<EM>&gt;How pathologically dangerous the society must have become to &gt;permit a

<EM>&gt;rational man like yourself to regard such fears as natural &gt;and attitudes

<EM>&gt;as righteous.

<P>Damien, you can't imagine how wildly wierd this sort of thing sounds to an 
<BR>
American, especially an Alaskan.  There is very real danger here in the U.S. 
<BR>
and it pays to be prepared for it in a rational way.  Lives are spared each 
<BR>
year by people who were ready for trouble.
<BR>
I admit I feel lucky to live in Anchorage which is a fairly safe city and 
<BR>
though I could get a license to carry a concealed weapon I don't feel the 
<BR>
need to.

My older brothers' best friend, who was the son of my grandfathers 
<BR>
bestfriend, (the pediatrician who birthed myself and my brothers), was 
<BR>
executed in his parents home at age 14 along with his father and mother by a 
<BR>
biker gang in 1978. He was pretty well trained by his father in use of 
<BR>
firearms, and the only reason he wasn't able to save himself and his parents 
<BR>
that night was because the .45 semiauto he used when the gange broke into 
<BR>
the house misfired on the first round. I was 9 at the time.

<P>I am very sorry for your loss.  I have a friend who used to be a farmer in 
<BR>
Idaho.  A biker gang gang-raped a fourteen year-old girl from her town and 
<BR>
drove to their nearby headquarters thinking they could get away with it.  
<BR>
The whole town mobilized with the leadership of the sheriff and they 
<BR>
surrounded the biker hangout.  A gunfight ensued and thousands of rounds 
<BR>
were fired.  No bikers survived the incident.  Some bikers may be cool guys, 
<BR>
but these were not and got what they deserved.
