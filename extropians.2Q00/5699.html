Y'know, I seem to recall exactly this argument having been a political
<BR>
football for the USA back in the ninteen-teens, with respect to emigrants 
<BR>
from eastern Europe. Funnily enough, it didn't happen that way ...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Poor countries usually are the way they are because the people there don't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have what it takes to create a prosperous, civilized society. You can blame it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on their big bad governments, but let's not forget that those governments are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just as much an expression of local culture as anything else.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Ah, the poor uncivilized inferior peoples canot be trusted to govern
<BR>
themselves!&quot; was always the rallying cry of the imperialist.  A lot of
<BR>
those countries you're complaining about are the way they are because
<BR>
until relatively recently (20-60 years ago) they were run as imperial
<BR>
dominions by one European colonial power or another -- or the US. Direct
<BR>
imperial rule went out of fashion after 1945, but was largely replaced
<BR>
by hands- off remote economic control; former colonial governments
<BR>
that didn't play by the rules laid down by the colonial power tended to
<BR>
undergo revolutions. Do you know what happened in Iran in 1956? Or in
<BR>
Vietnam in 1949? A lot of your own country's history is tied up in those
<BR>
dark colonial-era deeds ...
<BR>
<P>Now you -- a citizen of one of those rich colonial powers -- have the
<BR>
sheer effrontery to say that it's essential to keep out _precisely_ those
<BR>
natives of poor countries who are trying to improve their personal lot,
<BR>
and to insist that collectivism (stay at home! stay at home!) is the
<BR>
solution to their problems! I find that really ugly. (I find it also
<BR>
bespeaks a streak of racism that runs very close to the surface, but
<BR>
that's another matter.) The vast majority of these people are trying to
<BR>
emigrate *because they want to better themselves*. That comes with a 
<BR>
willingness to work for a pittance at jobs that no privileged citizen of
<BR>
a developed nation would touch, because that's the way to guarantee a
<BR>
better future.
<BR>
<P>Your country was *built* by people like that. That you have the gall to
<BR>
want to shut them out says more about your own inadequacy than anything
<BR>
else I could write.
