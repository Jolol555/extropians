Robert Freitas has gathered a collection of images of nanotech medical
<BR>
devices at <A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Gallery/index.html">http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Gallery/index.html</A>.
<BR>
Some are recent and others go back a decade or more.
<BR>
<P>Somehow none of the pictures look right to me.  It's hard to put my
<BR>
finger on what is wrong, though.
<BR>
<P>Maybe it is the whole idea of trying to render images as though visible
<BR>
light would work, at a realm where it really doesn't work very well.
<BR>
The images of red cells in arteries don't show the fluid, which should be
<BR>
full of gunk; they don't show any significant translucence in the cells;
<BR>
they don't show any detail on the cell surfaces.  It's like there is an
<BR>
arbitrary decision that we will treat certain objects as visible and all
<BR>
the rest as invisible.  Since Nature doesn't make the distinction for us,
<BR>
we have to do it ourselves.  The result always looks wrong.
<BR>
