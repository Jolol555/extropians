<P><EM>&gt;I would have let it drop, but today they ran ANOTHER eeyore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;article.  you remember Eeyore, the donkey?  Dismal, droopy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;character, not extropian at all:  &quot;It'll never wooork, oh deeear,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;woooe is meeee...&quot;, whereas Tigger is more my style, bouncing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around on his tail, always having fun and enjoying life: Woo hoo!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Wooo hooo!
</EM><BR>
<P>Tigger is really cool. He's my most favorite character out of the Pooh
<BR>
stories. He is a good a good character for this extropians crowd too because
<BR>
he believes in &quot;boundless expansion&quot; (or is it *bouncy* expansion?). He
<BR>
only gets into trouble sometimes when he thinks that he can fly
<BR>
and swim and then finds himself just a little bit stuck  ...
<BR>
<P>---------------------------
<BR>
Roo and Tigger were walking through the Forest one morning, and
<BR>
Tigger was talking about all the things that Tiggers can do...
<BR>
<P>&quot;Can they fly?&quot; asked Roo.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Tigger, &quot;they're very good flyers, Tiggers are
<BR>
Stornry good flyers.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Oo!&quot; said Roo. &quot;Can they fly as well as Owl?&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Tigger. &quot;Only they don't want to.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Well after this sort of talk had gone on for a while, they arrived
<BR>
at the Six Pine Trees:
<BR>
<P>&quot;I can swim,&quot; said Roo. &quot;I fell into the river, and I swimmed.&quot; Can
<BR>
Tiggers swim?&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Of course they can. Tiggers can do everything.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Can they climb trees better than Pooh?&quot; asked Roo, stopping under
<BR>
the tallest Pine Tree, and looking up at it.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Climbing trees is what they do best,&quot; said Tigger.
<BR>
&quot;Much better than Poohs.&quot;
<BR>
<P>And the next thing they knew, they were stuck in the tallest pine tree.
