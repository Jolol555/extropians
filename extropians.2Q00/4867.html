Shortage of circulating naive CD8+ T cells provides 
<BR>
insights on immunodeficiency in aging.
<BR>
<P>Blood 95: 2860-2868 2000
<BR>
<P>Abstract:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical obervations indicate that elderly people are
<BR>
prone to severe, often lethal infectious diseases induced
<BR>
by novel pathogens. Since the ability to mount primary
<BR>
immune responses relies on the availability of naive T
<BR>
cells, the circulating naive T-cell reservoir was evaluated
<BR>
throughout the human life span. Naive T cells were identified
<BR>
as CD95- T lymphocytes for their phenotypic and functional
<BR>
features. Indeed, the lack of CD95 marker is sufficient to
<BR>
identify a population of naive T cells, as defined by
<BR>
coincidence with previously characterized CD45RA+
<BR>
CD62L+ T cells. Naive CD95- T cells, as expected,
<BR>
require a costimulatory signal, such as CD28, to optimally
<BR>
proliferate after anti-CD3 stimulation. Cytofluorimetric
<BR>
analysis of circulating T lymphocytes from 120 healthy
<BR>
subjects ranging in age from 18 to 105 years revealed
<BR>
that naive T cells decreased sharply with age. the
<BR>
younger subjects had a naive T-lymphocyte count of
<BR>
177 +-28 cells/microL. Surprisingly, the naive T-cell
<BR>
count was lower in CD8+ than in CD4+ subsets at any
<BR>
age, and the oldest individuals were almost completely
<BR>
depleted of circulating naive CD8+ T cells (13 +-4 cells/microL).
<BR>
Concomitantly, a progressive expansion of CD28- T cells
<BR>
occurs with age, which can be interpreted as a compensatory
<BR>
mechanism. These data provide new insights into age
<BR>
related T-cell-mediated immunodeficiency and reveal
<BR>
some analogies of T-cell dynamics between advanced
<BR>
aging and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
<BR>
In conclusion, the exhaustion of the naive CD8+ T-cell
<BR>
reservoir, which has never been reported before, suggests
<BR>
that this T-cell pool is a major target of the aging process
<BR>
and may define a parameter possibly related to the life
<BR>
span of humans.
