<EM>&gt; Its well understood that the PM's government is hamstrung by the Ulsterites much like

<EM>&gt; the Republicans are hamstrung by the fundamentalist anti-abortionists (or the Cuban

<P>Put it another way: nobody wants to be there. But it's widely accepted that
<BR>
the alternative is a blood bath. Which is why there's no major troops-out
<BR>
movement on the mainland -- not because occupying Northern Ireland with the
<BR>
jackboot of British imperial oppression is popular, but because the 
<BR>
alternatives on offer _all_ look worse.

<P>(I suspect if Thatcher had gotten her way in the 80's and reintroduced
<BR>
conscription there'd have been a HUGE &quot;troops out&quot; movement, almost as soon
<BR>
as the first conscripts began coming home in body bags. But that's another 
<BR>
matter.)
