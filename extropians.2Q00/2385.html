<EM>&gt;government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; surveillance?  Now say 20% of the population wears the same kind of

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Heck it becomes so handy to vid-conference with friends and family
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whenever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you get the whim, imagine that everyone who now carries a cell phone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; everywhere they go, trades in the cell phone for a micro-cell-cam.  Now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; everyone you talk to, everywhere you go is potentially recording
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; everything you say and do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Looky there Big Brother didn't even have to lift a finger to do it, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can't blame him when every lie you ever tell ends up on America's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Funniest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Home Videos!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You'll note that I recently pointed out that very possibility (well,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;inevitability, actually) in a recent post.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, this does not get you the 'transparent' society you wanted.
</EM><BR>
<P>Funny, I don't ever remember describing the kind of transparent society I 
<BR>
wanted.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doesn't help the government catch pot smokers, or sexual perverts, or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else whos 'crimes' are consensual. Real criminal will not film themselves,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and they will break or steal private surveillance systems when they can.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Criminal conspiracies won't keep recordings for you either, unless they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;especially stupid. The list of wholes in the system goes on and on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Also, there are problems with using the recordings as evidence. Without a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;central database it takes real effort to figure out who might have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recording you want, find them, find out what they actually have, persuade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them to let you see it, figure out if it is real footage or something that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was faked up, etc. The net effect is not a transparent society, but simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one in which it is hard to lie convincingly about what you did in public.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no question that a completely transparent society would be near 
<BR>
impossible to implement *now*.  However, all the obstacles you mention are 
<BR>
dependent upon present-day public attitudes and present-day technology.  
<BR>
Both of these are rapidly changing, even exponentially so.  So when you tell 
<BR>
me that ubiquitous surveillance won't happen *in the future* I simply don't 
<BR>
believe it.  I could be wrong, but I don't believe it.
<BR>

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
