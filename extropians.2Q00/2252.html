<EM>&gt; Revolvers are not normally considered semi-automatic, even by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-gun crowd.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I know that this is not the way the term is usually used, but by
<BR>
definition it is correct.  Much in the same way many people use &quot;auto&quot;
<BR>
when they mean &quot;semi-auto&quot;.  I was just nitpicking; I understood what you
<BR>
were saying.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I've tried arguing this with them with no success, I'm a proud
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; owner of a HK USP 9mm myself.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>Over the years I have owned 4 USPs (3 .40, 1 .45) and have never had a
<BR>
single failure of any type in any of them and they all have &gt;5,000
<BR>
rounds through them.  My oldest one (an early model USP40) has &gt;15,000
<BR>
flawless rounds through it.  The USP series has developed a reputation as
<BR>
one of the most durable and reliable pistols on the market (also one of
<BR>
the most expensive unfortunately).  The USP9 is actually supposed to be
<BR>
the least reliable of the bunch (in terms of MRBF), but it still fairs
<BR>
very well overall, and I've heard that the USP9 Compact is right up there
<BR>
with the rest of them in terms of reliability.
<BR>
<P>As a point of reference, I know that the MRBF figure for the exceedingly
<BR>
popular USP40 Compact is around 10,200 rounds (I just happen to know this
<BR>
one off the top of my head) and most other USPs are similar.  The MRBF
<BR>
figures for Glocks are somewhat less, but still good.  By point of
<BR>
comparison, IIRC many high-quality, popular revolvers have a MRBF in the
<BR>
5,000-6,000 range.  The accuracy of the H&amp;Ks *are* significantly better
<BR>
than the Glocks in general.  I love SIGs (very nice and extremely
<BR>
accurate), but they are somewhat less durable and reliability is not
<BR>
uniform though generally acceptable.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; At least they both own nice collections of .44mags and classic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colts....
</EM><BR>
<P>I can't argue with that.  I wouldn't mind having a Colt SAA myself.
