<EM>&gt; Right.  Which leads me to believe that your average terrorists, mail

<EM>&gt; bombers, and general nutcases do not have access to this technology.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Otherwise they'd use it.
</EM><BR>
<P>'Fraid I disagree. Case in point: the history of Northern Irish republican
<BR>
groups prior to the current (rather tenuous, but prolonged) cease-fire.
<BR>
<P>In 1991-94, the Provisional IRA demonstrated that if it wanted to it
<BR>
could inflict massive economic damage on the British mainland. A single
<BR>
active service unit (four committed guerillas) took out a bridge at the
<BR>
interesection of the M1 motorway and the North Circular, causing massive
<BR>
traffic disruption in London. They then went on and critically damaged
<BR>
an office block in the City. Combined effect of these explosions was a
<BR>
repair bill in excess of UKP 1Bn (about $1.5Bn). In a related train of
<BR>
incidents they distributed cigarrette-sized incendiary bombs, stuffed
<BR>
into cracks in the seats of tube and commuter trains. Using code-words
<BR>
and phoned messages they amplified the impact of this campaign so that
<BR>
there were 10 false alarms for each actual incident. (Even living outside
<BR>
London and not using the tube for commuting, I got caught in about three
<BR>
evacuations during the 18-month period of that campaign.)
<BR>
<P>Note that these are _conventional_ terrorists with _conventional_ weapons
<BR>
(i.e. home-made bombs).
<BR>
<P>Now for the scary bit: virtually nobody was killed or injured in that
<BR>
campaign. But the pIRA have traditionally been pretty trigger-happy and
<BR>
willing to shed blood. My analysis is that if they had WANTED to they
<BR>
could have killed tens of thousands of people. Certainly, the US World
<BR>
Trade Centre bombing -- although amateurish and botched -- was an attempt
<BR>
to do just that; if they'd brought down the towers, the death toll would
<BR>
have been as high as or higher than a suitcase A-bomb. The pIRA were at
<BR>
least as skilled as that bunch; if they'd decided to take out Canary
<BR>
Wharf, the death toll would have been in the 20,000-60,000 range. And
<BR>
I'm fairly certain they could have done it. (Once you pack enough people
<BR>
into a small enough area, you don't _need_ weapons of mass destruction;
<BR>
that's why a single loony with a revolver can kill 200 people -- _if_
<BR>
they're on board an airliner in flight, and the loony doesn't mind dying
<BR>
in the process. As has happened ...)
<BR>
<P>The REASON the pIRA stuck to bombs, M-16's, and cordless drills applied
<BR>
to kneecaps, is that causing megadeath would have been a major own goal.
<BR>
Their political goal was small-scale -- intimidate the fuck out of the
<BR>
Unionists (to the point of causing a Kosovo-style exodus, if possible),
<BR>
bludgeon the British government into reinstituting local rule on terms
<BR>
favourable to them, and ultimately achieving union with the South
<BR>
(which wanted union with the North like it wanted a hole in the head --
<BR>
&quot;what the hell will we do with Ian Paisley?&quot;). 
<BR>
<P>These were concrete political goals, and in principle achievable --
<BR>
but only IF the pIRA could convince people that (despite the thing about
<BR>
kneecaps and protestants) the pIRA had a program, and giving in on some
<BR>
key points would get them to hang up the Armalites.
<BR>
<P>Going mad-dog bull-goose crazy and nuking London would _not_ convince
<BR>
anyone (let alone the hard-core Unionists) that the pIRA should be
<BR>
negotiated with. Demonstrating the _capability_ to nuke London, then
<BR>
pointedly saying &quot;but we aren't going to do that -- now let's negotiate&quot;,
<BR>
is another matter.
<BR>
<P>Now, despite the political spin and what you read in the newspapers, most
<BR>
so-called terrorists _do_ have a rational framework, however misguided their
<BR>
starting assumptions may be. Most of them aren't in all-out war with the
<BR>
powers that be; they want to obtain concessions, and it's a lot easier
<BR>
to obtain concessions by showing the stick, and demanding to negotiate,
<BR>
than by using the stick (which tends to induce an understandable desire
<BR>
for immediate retalliation on the part of those on the receiving end of it).
<BR>
<P>There are exceptions, of course. The INLA splintered off the pIRA in
<BR>
the early 1970's. They didn't get much funding from NORAID, so they
<BR>
decided to supplement their income by selling hard drugs. The pIRA had
<BR>
effectively driven the RUC (the police) out of large chunks of Belfast,
<BR>
and therefore ended up administering their own brand of vigilante
<BR>
justice; the resulting gang wars coincided with the bloodiest period of
<BR>
the Troubles and ended with the INLA being effectively wiped out. By the
<BR>
end, the INLA (originally the Maoist wing of the pIRA) had turned into
<BR>
just another drugs gang -- with heavy weapons and a sideline in terrorism.
<BR>
<P>Then there are those whose rational frameworks _look_ crazy from the
<BR>
outside.  Bin Laden's is based on (a) a fundamentalist interpretation of
<BR>
Islam, and (b) a very paranoid conspiracy world-view in which the USA is
<BR>
actively oppressing the Islamic world and intends to impose Christianity
<BR>
onit -- he's still thinking in terms of the Crusades, and given the way
<BR>
_every_ US politician I've ever seen uses religious rhetoric these days,
<BR>
I can't blame him for that. Someone who adopts this world-view isn't nuts
<BR>
if they carry out a suicide bombing; they're just uploading themselves 
<BR>
into paradise.
<BR>
<P>Or take the Aum Shinriko sect. (Immanetising the Eschaton -- with sarin.)
<BR>
_If_ you buy their religious axioms, what they do makes perfect sense
<BR>
(after a fashion). And those guys _would_ have used nukes if they could
<BR>
gotten their hands on them.
<BR>
<P>Summary: before you can predict whether terrorists will use nano, you
<BR>
need to step outside your preconceptions and work out what motivates
<BR>
the terrorists (who, from their own perspective, may have good reasons
<BR>
for _not_ using nano).
