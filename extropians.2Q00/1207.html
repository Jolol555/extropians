<P>
The DINKS and others need to be free to develop their own retirement accounts,
<BR>
rather than having their wealth siphoned off by the welfare state. If they do
<BR>
this, they won't need much of a next generation to pay for their retirement.
<BR>
<P>A criminal in prison, depending on the location, costs from $30,000.00 to
<BR>
$60,000.00 a year to house. A person on welfare makes between $14,000.00 to
<BR>
$35,000.00, again depending on location, dependents, etc.. counting the 50%
<BR>
bureaucratic overhead on that welfare tab, you are talking about a $28k to $70k
<BR>
overall cost per year to keep someone on welfare. Many of the state sponsored
<BR>
'workfare' programs are similarly expensive, typically such programs spend a
<BR>
minimum of $100,000.00 for every low level job they place a welfare recipient
<BR>
in. Part of that is subsidies to the employer, part overhead, etc.
<BR>
<P>Abortion in the US, by a large margin, has become not a means by which a low
<BR>
income single woman can end a pregnancy to prevent bring a child into a poor
<BR>
life (though that is still present), it is mostly a method by which well-off or
<BR>
well to do middle and upper class women can eliminate any possible drag on their
<BR>
careers and upwardly mobile lifestyle. Look up the numbers for yourself. Middle
<BR>
and upper class single women abort more frequently per capita than poor women.
<BR>
<P>Here's a link on abortion opinions by class:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.publicagenda.org/issues/angles_graph.cfm?issue_type=abortion&id=428&graph=nd3.gif">http://www.publicagenda.org/issues/angles_graph.cfm?issue_type=abortion&id=428&graph=nd3.gif</A>
<BR>
<P>While heres an indication that the reasons women have for abortion have nothing
<BR>
to do with the health of the mother or baby, or that they were victims of rape:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.publicagenda.org/issues/factfiles_detail.cfm?issue_type=abortion&list=17">http://www.publicagenda.org/issues/factfiles_detail.cfm?issue_type=abortion&list=17</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;although this one does say that 68% of women state that they 'can't afford a
<BR>
baby right now', they don't explain what that means, whether its truly an income
<BR>
thing, or whether they can't afford the impact it will have on their careers...

<P><EM>&gt; Maybe you can look at welfare this way:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Givens:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - There is always going to be a segment of the population which is &quot;dead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weight&quot;, ie not able to support itself. This seems a fairly reasonable given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to me, but if you don't agree, speak up!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - Those unable to support themselves can either be supported by someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else, or must turn to the black economy (and crime). (or die I guess, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not too many are going for this one out of choice).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - Crime costs more than the welfare bill. (is this true?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now the libertarian objects to paying tax for welfare. But surely, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agregate level of crime inflicted per person must be at least as invasive of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rights as welfare.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So the most violating of &quot;good&quot; citizens (hee hee) rights is crime, followed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by paying tax for welfare. Maybe the unsupported citizen should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; identified and &quot;terminated&quot; (ouch), but by whom? How do you seperate such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person (known as &quot;dole bludgers&quot; in the local rags), from those who are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; temporarily down on their luck, but truly trying to &quot;do the right thing&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (ooh I'm feeling all protestant all of a sudden).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The point is, you can't make such a decision. Welfare is the least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detrimental of all available options to each individual's rights, and thus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be decided upon from an individualist point of view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ---
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's been some comment about not letting those who can't afford to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; babies to do so. Maybe you guys in the US don't have the aging population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem that we do in Australia. Over here, people say the same things...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     - We don't want No Stinkin Welfare mums (&quot;moms&quot; in American),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     - We don't want No Stinkin immigration,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     - We don't got no Stinkin Workers to support the baby boomers in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retirement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a no brainer. Having kids is not a luxury in the west, it's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessity, from a social viewpoint. That, or increased immigration of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; younguns (those third-world types still know how its done!). Australia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rewards the DINKS (double income no kids) for their hassle free lifestyle by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not requiring them to have any responsibility for raising the next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generation, apart from throwing the same few sheckles to the govt that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parents have to throw. It's crazy really; we all need the coming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generations, but damned if anyone is willing to pay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oddly enough, many of the same people who don't want to foot this bill seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be those who aren't too interested in immigrants. White people are going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to turn up in history books (databases, yeah yeah) as curiosities; stomped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all over the globe, made everyone else's lives hell, then just when they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looked like a real problem, they just stopped procreating. Couldn't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bothered.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe instead of getting cranky with those poor people who breed all over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the place, we could educate their kids. For purely selfish reasons.
