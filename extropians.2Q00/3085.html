An article on slashdot today describes the grant by cypherpunk Raph
<BR>
Levien of 19 patents he owns to be used for free by open source software
<BR>
projects.  Most of his patents relate to printing technology; I have
<BR>
heard that Raph has made quite a good living from licensing his patents.
<BR>
It is very generous of him to give this technology away in this manner.
<BR>
<P>One of the patents might be of interest to those wanting to expand their
<BR>
sensory inputs.  Raph describes a special pair of glasses designed to
<BR>
enhance color perception:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/details?patent_number=5218386">http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/details?patent_number=5218386</A>
<BR>
<P>The idea is that the lenses filter certain frequencies so that others are
<BR>
relatively enhanced.  One eye's filter enhances red, green, and blue,
<BR>
tuned to match human color receptors.  The other eye's filter enhances
<BR>
the complementary colors.
<BR>
<P>As I understand it, this would produce no change when viewing a black and
<BR>
white image, because these are uniform mixtures of colors.  However when
<BR>
viewing a colored object, each eye would see a different mixture of the
<BR>
light frequencies which go into making up the color.  Presumably the
<BR>
goal is that the brain would over time learn to integrate the two color
<BR>
experiences from the two eyes and produce a unified color perception.
<BR>
This would in effect be a six-channel color rather than the three-channel
<BR>
color we normally see.  Two objects which look like the same color
<BR>
normally might look different when viewed through these glasses.
<BR>
<P>Raph suggests some industrial applications, such as mixing paints that
<BR>
have to match under a wide range of lighting conditions.  But it would
<BR>
seem that it could be an easy way to experiment with improving sensory
<BR>
discrimination for those who want to expand their mental powers.
<BR>
<P>(I have noticed that my two eyes perceive colors slightly differently.
<BR>
It is only apparent if I alternately close my two eyes.  One sees
<BR>
things in a more &quot;yellow&quot;, warm tone and the other is more grayish.
<BR>
These differences are too subtle though to provide any real enhancement.)
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately these glasses don't seem to fit into Raph's giveaway
<BR>
because they couldn't be used in an open source software project.  But we
<BR>
still might get some ideas for other enhancements along these lines.
<BR>
And perhaps it would not be too terrible to try some small scale
<BR>
experiments with Raph's idea to see what it would be like.
<BR>
