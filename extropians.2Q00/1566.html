1929 could certainly happen again, if fact it already has, on October 17, 1987
<BR>
the market declined by 28%, twice as bad as the worst day in 1929, and yet in
<BR>
retrospect we can say that 1987 was no big deal. The real question is if the
<BR>
unprecedented 1929 to 1933  bear market could ever happen again.
<BR>
Forget about head and shoulders tops, triple bottoms, or high PE ratios, a disaster
<BR>
of that magnitude could only happen if we entered a catastrophic global depression,
<BR>
and that could only happen if government regulators get too creative.
<BR>
<P>The stock market crashed in October of 1929 but that's not when the depression
<BR>
started. In  April of 1930 the economy was bad but there was still no reason to think
<BR>
the downturn would be any worse than other stock crashes in 1890, 1893, or 1907 .
<BR>
The difference was that then the Federal Reserve did not exist and this time the Fed
<BR>
had a brainstorm. The Fed  figured that several high profile banks failures must be
<BR>
caused by excessive speculation, so instead of dramatically increasing the money
<BR>
supply as you might expect they actually decreased it by 3%.  Somehow that didn't help,
<BR>
but not to worry they were just getting warmed up. The civil servants at the Fed had
<BR>
another theory, the most important thing about a country's economy was the size of it's
<BR>
gold reserve. Gold had been flowing into the USA for 2 years so reserves were at a
<BR>
record level, but in September of 1931 the flow started to move into other countries,
<BR>
especially England. The Fed was determined to do whatever it took to stop this trend,
<BR>
so even though we were 2 years into a bad recession (though still not yet a full blown
<BR>
depression) they increased interest rates more quickly than they had ever done before,
<BR>
or since. It worked, by March 1933 the gold reserve started to grow again. Hurray!
<BR>
The cure had another effect, the money supply shark by an incredible 35% and the
<BR>
economy of the USA disintegrated.
<BR>
<P>Physicists Chemists and Biologists are always quick to tell you that there is a lot they
<BR>
don't know and they could always be wrong about a lot of stuff, I think economist's
<BR>
need to learn a little humility too. In the 1930's their theories were wrong, dead wrong,
<BR>
they slammed on the brake just when they should have hit the accelerator turning a
<BR>
local short lived garden variety recession into a decade long global depression.
