<EM>&gt; I can't claim to have visited many 3rd world countries, but I've spent some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time in Mexico. I've noticed 2 major causes of poverty there.  One is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Catholic church which discourages the use of contraceptives and abortion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The second is the behavior of people who hold positions of power in various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governmental and corporate entities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When you buy bananas at the grocery store, odds are they came from land that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was once occupied by people who grew enough food, fiber, and fuel crops on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the land to take care of themselves.  Business corporations, acting in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conjunction with the Mexican (and sometimes the U.S.) government, took over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the land and gave the people who'd been using it the option of leaving or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; staying there and working for the corporation at very low wages, which they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would use to buy exorbitantly priced food at the grocery store (likely also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; owned by the corporation). The more self-respecting of the disposssed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; peasants go to seek their fortunes in the city.  The lucky ones have friends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the U.S. who can help them find work (if they can make it safely across
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the border and get past the check points). Others live on the outskirts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cities such as Mexico D.F.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the ugly side of capitalism.  If I'm not mistaken, the term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capitalism describes an economic system, not a political system. 
</EM><BR>
<P>What you describe is basically feudal mercantilism. It is most definitely NOT
<BR>
capitalism.
