<EM>&gt; &gt; This past monday, in case it wasn't in your local paper (and considering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; way they lean usually, it probably wasn't), the Supreme Court ruled in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; favor of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the defendant, Lopez, in deciding that the Gun-Free School Zones Act is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unconstitutional in its overly broad claim under the Commerce Clause. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ruled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that a person carrying a weapon on school grounds or within 1000 feet of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; school
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; grounds does not fit the definition of engaging in interstate commerce.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this ruling, we have one more nail in the coffin of gun control.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Don't uncork the champaigne too soon.  The general mood, as exhibited by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; polls, is still in favor of more gun control.  And that particular law was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heinously stupid.  Why does crime X -- whether you agree X should be a crime
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or not -- suddenly become so much worse because it takes place near a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; school?  Imagine if all laws were like that.  You get caught driving with an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overdue inspection sticker and you get a higher fine because you're within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1K feet of a school.  Your dog barks at two a.m. and the judge increases the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; punishment because a high school is nearby.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats not even the basis upon which Lopez won. Congress tries to apply
<BR>
every law it passes in response to the media yellow journalism to
<BR>
interstate commerce in some respect, because that, in reality is the
<BR>
only way in which it is capable of federalizing what were formerly state
<BR>
level crimes (outside of the civil rights amendment).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I gather such laws arose either to overcome local opposition to the law or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to make it look like politicians are being tough on crime.  I wonder if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone has assessed their impact.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since US v Lopez first overturned the law in 1995, gun crime in schools
<BR>
has dropped to its lowest level in decades. The current hysteria over
<BR>
Columbine and other school shootings is so distanced from reality its
<BR>
insane.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The fact this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; came so soon after the Million Mutha March (oops, make that the 100,000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; march) indicates that the conservative block of Rhenquist, O'Connor,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kennedy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Scalia, and Thomas that steadily maintains the fundamental principle that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; law enacted by Congress must be based on one or more of its powers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enumerated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the Constitution&quot;, will likely continue on this track when and if it hears
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US v.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Emerson next year,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would not praise them too highly.  In several recent decisions, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expanded police powers.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Miranda ruling was odd, I admit. I would not have been surprised if
<BR>
they just said that not mirandizing someone was no longer grounds for
<BR>
dismissal, but removing the requirement entirely was a bit of a reach.
<BR>
Considering todays education system, you can't expect everyone to know
<BR>
those rights, although the prevalence of Miranda in tv cop shows has
<BR>
generated a pretty extensive public knowledge of them. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Assuming Bush gets elected, I forsee US. v. Emerson passing the Court with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; devastating victory for gun owner rights and the 2nd Amendment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Assuming he gets elected...  But the problem is, a Conservative Court is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; friend to freedom in general.  Surely, we might -- ah, might! -- get some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun control removed, but in other areas, such as police power, we might have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more freedoms curtailed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All power to the Libertariat!
</EM><BR>
<P>The current Court's ruling philosphy seems to be based on literal
<BR>
interpretation, original intent, that sort of thing. While it does seem
<BR>
to take a dim view of criminal's rights, it has done very well to hold
<BR>
up freedom of expression in some areas. For example, Playboy.com just
<BR>
won a case before the SCOTUS against a law that mandated that they
<BR>
scramble all of their broadcasts occuring during daytime hours. On the
<BR>
other hand, everyone BUT Thomas voted to uphold workplace restrictions
<BR>
on racist speech (while Thomas is a vocal proponent of free speech, I
<BR>
think his vote was mainly an 'up yours' toward the NAACP and others that
<BR>
have been out to get him and who opposed his appointment.)
