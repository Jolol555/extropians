<P><EM>&gt; | You'd need to be able to develop bio-safe implants.  Main problem:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | infections around breached skin (as in, where the skin meets the plug or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | the display screen).  Not a problem in rooms where surgery performed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | (allows temporary breach to insert devices); major problem for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | day-to-day use in public spaces.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been thinking in terms of physiological (genetic) modification to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nervous system, and possibly nanotechnology to create the physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interfaces on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis (I know - I'm not in a hurry).
</EM><BR>
<P>Nice dream for the future.  But a business would need to get something
<BR>
out the door en route, to get itself there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Consider a dedicated neural &quot;processing&quot; center for i/o and decoding (becaue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's bidirectional communication) - similiar to speech centers?  Add a &quot;high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capacity&quot; nerve which connects this center to an ending in, say, your left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrist.  When a physical interface is required to an external machine, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nano-entities create microscopic electronic passageways to the surface of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the skin, which interact directly with hardware.  Advantages to this: 1) you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might not need a &quot;standard&quot; physical interface to connect to (nanotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adaptability), 2) probably no infection worries, 3) the nanotech could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably insulate the body from any raw electricity or radiation.  Also,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since I've got nano-entities in my world - they might as well repair any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tissue damage that does occur.  :-)  Primary disadvantage: this all depends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on currently nonexistent technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>Intermediate step: determine the nature of those microscopic electronic
<BR>
passageways.  Could you come up with some that could be implanted and
<BR>
left in?  If so, then there's no need for nanotech to create them on
<BR>
demand, thus bringing this much closer to current tech.  (The neural
<BR>
processing center still has to be developed, of course.)

<P>Hey, if you've got it, use it (as appropriate).  I can send you an HTML
<BR>
version of this if you want, though it's not the best dissertation out
<BR>
there, and most of what it argues for has already come into commercial
<BR>
reality since it was written.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; | Both problems are already being worked on.  Perhaps a good first product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | - tackling only the first issue, not the second - would be a hard drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | implanted in one's arm, with an I/O plug or minicomputer worn around it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | and communicating via induction.  The plug/computer could get stolen,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | but stealing the data would not be a pickpocket's work, as opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | (say) a laptop.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I like it!  You'd also have one foot in the door on more &quot;complex&quot; projects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (see above).
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is why it is a good *first* product.  Chain the products out so
<BR>
that each one takes you one step closer to your ultimate goal, each one
<BR>
building on existing tech (previously deployed products counting as
<BR>
&quot;existing&quot; by definition).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; | Remember, business plans are about *business*.  Funders don't care about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | submissions of proposals to standards bodies - at least, not directly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My logic on this:  The development of a standard contributes to acceptance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and validation of your business model.  From a risk perspective: theory is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cheaper than application.  From an economic and sociological perspective:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society is going to require a period of adjustment to even the most trivial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of &quot;AHCI&quot; applications - the standards process is a good start.  There are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many people who would view even this conversation as immoral/dangerous.
</EM><BR>
<P>Granted.  And for that reason, it would be a good secondary activity for
<BR>
the business, to protect/enhance acceptance of its products.  But just
<BR>
developing the standard will not, in and of itself, generate revenue, so
<BR>
you also need something that does.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; | The most overriding question you'll have to address: how are you going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | to make money off of this?  There are many ways you can do this, but you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | have to look to find them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suppose I would look forward to a decent salary for the next ten years,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develop a working prototype in late 2009, go into production in 2010, retire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in 2012.
</EM><BR>
<P>Aye, and there's the rub.  Businesses have trouble predicting the market
<BR>
even five years out, so funders don't like to invest in startups that,
<BR>
even if things go as planned, won't see a penny of income for ten years.
<BR>
Now, get something that can go into production by 2005, and one can plan
<BR>
to use the profits from that to fund research through 2010, since the
<BR>
funders can cash out on the first one if things go bad.
<BR>
<P>BTW, having retired, what would you do then?  If you've been working on
<BR>
this for ten years, and now that it hits the market, people are coming
<BR>
up with all kinds of uses, would you really be content to only further
<BR>
your vision for a mere two years?  (Maybe you *could* retire
<BR>
financially.  There's a reason why people like Bill Gates and Larry
<BR>
Ellison are still with their current companies, regardless of what one
<BR>
thinks of said companies.)
