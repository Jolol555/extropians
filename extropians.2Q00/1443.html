<P><EM>&gt; He goes into it later in the post. I personally can't dissagree witht
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the logic either, even though I'm libertarian, I'm a libertarian of very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Spartan sentiments. A man who has nothing worth dying for has nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  worth living for, IMNSHO. People who refuse to enlist or be drafted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ought to be stripped of citizenship, as far as I am concerned. If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  are contientious objector, thats fine, you can serve in the medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  corps or some other non-combat role. I would prefer people that are that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  honest about their opinions than those who are a) cowards, b) too stupid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to understand that the best place to hide from a war is often in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  military. You are much more likely to be killed or injured if you are a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  draftee than if you join up. When you join up voluntarily you have some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  control over what you actually wind up doing, which can minimize your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  risk as much as you care.
</EM><BR>
<P>ok...now explain the  viet nam war (into which I was forcibly associated) in 
<BR>
relation to the above sentiments..
