<P><EM> &gt;&gt; The assertion that &quot;real&quot;, art must be an object is wrong. Extropic art

<EM> &gt;&gt;creativity, bioengineering, performance, conceptual art, virtual reality,

new
<BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;film media, nanotechnology, ideas, etc., as valid mediums. It must.

<P>Good point.
<BR>
<P>(snip)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;yet much art is created with the eye to disenfranchise the eye of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;general populace. Abstract artists tend to really excell at trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;disconnect the audience from understanding.
</EM><BR>
<P>Abstract artist were following the trend in the arts and sciences.
<BR>
However, it purposefully tried to create a communication with those who
<BR>
took the time to learn the language, the terms and the meaning of the work.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that this is quite powerful.  Instead of the audience looking and
<BR>
pictures, it required that the audience think for themselves and
<BR>
communicate with the art.  Many people did not want to do this because it
<BR>
took too much time or effort, but those who did fully understood the
<BR>
concepts of Abstract art and Abstract Expressionism.
<BR>
<P>(snip)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;I can answer this one: because when those of us who are technically
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;astute but not aethetically astute take a look at contemporary art, too
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;often we feel like we are being asked to wear the emperor's new
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;clothes..
</EM><BR>
<P>If one doesn't have the talent to be aesthetically astute  - why not at
<BR>
least knowledgeable?   Balance.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;As they say in the movies,&quot;I'll see it when it comes out on video.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Both = art modes.
