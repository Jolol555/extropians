The thing that most troubles me after having 
<BR>
been taken on a long ride through the system, is that the psychoanalysts 
<BR>
seemed to me to be the most messed up of all of us. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, indeed true!  When my daughter was small, we had big troubles with her 
<BR>
(theiving) and eventually went the  shrink/psychologist/psychiatrist route.  
<BR>
The first one was... *so stupid* he could not seem to figure out who we were 
<BR>
or what we were there for from visit to visit - and we were neighbors!  The 
<BR>
second admitted that she was totally unable to work with my daughter, reasons 
<BR>
unspecified.  
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;
<BR>
I won't even hazard a 
<BR>
guess as to why, but I don't have enough fingers or toes to count the times 
<BR>
I have ended up discussing my psychologists' problems with them instead of 
<BR>
discussing what they perceived as my own. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Our third started out being a good bit better, I thought.  He wanted to see 
<BR>
the whole family for a visit or two to get a feel for how we related.  Made 
<BR>
sense to me.  But...  as he continued for several more visits trying to 
<BR>
counsel us parents separately, I found I was listening to his problems with 
<BR>
his sons (considerably younger than my children) and comforting and 
<BR>
encouraging him... but *I* wasn't getting paid for *my* expertise.  :/
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;
<BR>
I cannot believe my experiences were 
<BR>
isolated and that I just happened to get the most useless psychologists 
<BR>
around. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>:)))  My daughter complained to me that it was so boring to go there every 
<BR>
week after school, she'd rather be home playing/reading/doing homework.  I 
<BR>
myself was sick and tired of it, and hoped to see real signs of improvement 
<BR>
so we could quit while feeling we'd accomplished something.  Daughter said 
<BR>
all they did was play card games, I think Uno was the one mentioned.  I 
<BR>
finally said to her, &quot;You will continue to go there, and I will sit on the 
<BR>
steps (boring...) and wait for you, every week, no matter what, until *I* 
<BR>
feel convinced that your behavior has improved.  And if I see a relapse we'll 
<BR>
be right back again.  Do you understand?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Within a couple months it was all done.  She has never relapsed, and seems to 
<BR>
have ... either forgiven or understood or both, for she appears to hold no 
<BR>
grudges against me for this... punishment.  
<BR>
<P>I sure wish I'd found a cheaper way, though.  Something I could do at home on 
<BR>
my own.   
<BR>
<P>One thing he did recommend, though, which I think is worth passing on:  Hug 
<BR>
your kid.  Make sure to keep that connection.  Even big boys like hugs, 
<BR>
though perhaps not in public, unless the mom can make a game of it (like 
<BR>
maybe hug his friends too).  Encourage laughter - I found it came with the 
<BR>
hugs.
