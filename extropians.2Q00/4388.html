<EM>&gt; what i find absolutely intriguing is the very possiblity that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universe is flat. i trust that members of this list do not need any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reminders as to what eerie odds would be overcome if such were really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the case. funny that a year ago, few would have considered such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possiblity -- the universe was either open or closed, and open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looked more likely ...

<EM>&gt; I've been watching this thread for some time and my ignorance of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matters is driving me crazy - what is meant by 'flat' in this context?  My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immediate reaction to the adjective 'flat' is 'nearly two dimensional'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certainly I have the wrong idea - given a &gt;2 dimensional universe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And, I would love to hear more about,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'what eerie odds would be overcome if such were really the case.'

<P>'flat' as in wider than it is deep, pancake shaped, though the pancake is still
<BR>
many billions of light years thick, so no, it doesn't mean a two dimensional
<BR>
universe. The 'flatness' may also only be a quasi-local observation, much as a
<BR>
bacteria living in the material of a rubber balloon is convicenced that a) the
<BR>
balloon universe is flat, and b) that it is hugely thick. Its all a matter of
<BR>
perspective, and it does not discount the possibility of an inflationary
<BR>
universe, though it does imply a much larger universe than we had originally
<BR>
anticipated...it will be interesting how this situation resolves itself.
