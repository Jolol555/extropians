<P>GM Mosquito Could Help Eliminate Malaria - Scientists
<BR>
By Patricia Reaney
<BR>
<P>LONDON (Reuters) - European scientists have created the world's first
<BR>
genetically modified malaria mosquito that could one day help to rid the
<BR>
world of the disease that kills an estimated 2.7 million people each year.
<BR>
<P>By inserting a marker gene into the species of mosquito that carries
<BR>
malaria, researchers at Imperial College London and the European Molecular
<BR>
Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany have come a step closer to
<BR>
creating a mosquito to stop the spread of the disease.
<BR>
<P>``With what we have available it is theoretically possible to construct in
<BR>
the laboratory a mosquito which is resistant to malaria,'' Dr Andrea
<BR>
Crisanti, of Imperial College, told Reuters.
<BR>
<P>The scientists inserted an extra gene that produces a green fluorescent
<BR>
protein which distinguishes the transgenic insect from other mosquitoes and
<BR>
makes it visible under ultraviolet light.
<BR>
<P>The achievement means scientists may soon be able to substitute other genes
<BR>
that could make the malaria-carrying Anopheles mosquito produce antibodies
<BR>
to the malaria parasite or a resistance to it.
<BR>
<P>They may also be able to change the mosquito's behavior so it feeds on
<BR>
animals instead of humans.
<BR>
<P>``We think that within six years a mosquito will be created that is stable,
<BR>
safe and physically unable to transmit the malaria-causing parasite,''
<BR>
Crisanti, a molecular entomologist added.
<BR>
<P>Major Breakthrough
<BR>
<P>The research reported in the science journal Nature has been hailed as a
<BR>
breakthrough in the battle against malaria which infects up to 500 million
<BR>
people a year.
<BR>
<P>``The announcement of stable germ line transformation of Anopheles
<BR>
mosquitoes represents a major breakthrough in the file of molecular
<BR>
entomology,'' Dr Carlos Morel, a tropical disease specialist with the WHO
<BR>
and World Bank, said in a statement.
<BR>
<P>``The transformed green mosquitoes now signal a green light for more serious
<BR>
investment in the development of new approaches for malaria control,'' he
<BR>
added.
<BR>
<P>Most cases of malaria are caused by a parasite that is transmitted to humans
<BR>
by the female mosquito. The parasites enter the bloodstream and travel to
<BR>
the liver where they replicate by the thousands.
<BR>
<P>The disease, which causes fever, muscle stiffness and shaking and sweating,
<BR>
is increasing because the parasite has developed a resistance to
<BR>
anti-malarial drugs.
<BR>
<P>Scientists have had difficulty in creating transgenic malaria mosquitoes
<BR>
because the mosquito egg hardens quickly, making it difficult to inject the
<BR>
new gene into it.
<BR>
<P>``In order to circumvent this problem we tested a series of compounds for
<BR>
their ability to slow down the process. One compound proved very effective
<BR>
and allowed us to inject the embryos while they were still soft,'' Crisanti
<BR>
explained.
<BR>
<P>Crisanti and his colleagues believe transferring a gene that confers
<BR>
resistance to the parasite will be the winning strategy.
<BR>
<P>``What we want to do is spread the resistant gene through the transgenic
<BR>
mosquito,'' he added.
