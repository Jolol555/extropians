<P>Ah, but I'm not talking only about working with the government. Habitat

for Humanity, Food Gatherers, and groups like that have done more to help

people than most government programs have.

<P>Given, if the government came along and offered me a suitcase of money
<BR>
on terms that weren't inconsistant with whatever it was I was already
<BR>
up to, well, mama didn't raise no fool. Not too different from basic
<BR>
research funding, really.
<BR>
<P>But getting back to the original topic, it's perfectly possible and
<BR>
self-consistant for lassiez-faire capitalist types to help those in
<BR>
need and do it more efficiently than centrally planned bureaucracies
<BR>
ever will (as seems to be the case with other areas of life). All
<BR>
while cultivating a new market for their cell phones/folding
<BR>
houseboats/internet appliances/solar stoves/what have you.
<BR>
<P>Who was it that came up with the idea that to help others you have to 
<BR>
necesserily sacrifice yourself? That damn zero sum assumption sneaking
<BR>
up on us again.
