<P>
Considering that I've long been of the opinion that
<BR>
most of Freud's theories were wrong, it's kind of
<BR>
ironic to be adding my voice to those supporting
<BR>
him, but anyway....
<BR>
<P>In particular, the comment to the effect that dreams
<BR>
are not a &quot;royal road&quot; to the unconscious raised my
<BR>
hackles, as it sounds like the author was referring
<BR>
to a philosophically invalid idea that became
<BR>
popular about a decade ago, but is being discredited
<BR>
more recently.
<BR>
<P>I won't be able to be detailed because I'm not an
<BR>
expert and I don't remeber the researchers names.
<BR>
<P>About a decade ago, when certain brain researchers
<BR>
concluded that dreams were caused when certain
<BR>
systems in the brain attempts to interpret random
<BR>
firing of neurons during sleep, many concluded
<BR>
(illogically) that this completely invalidated
<BR>
dream interpretation. The argument was that, since
<BR>
dreams are merely a knee-jerk attempt by the brain
<BR>
to interpret as meaningful signals which were
<BR>
in fact random and meaningless, then dreams therefore
<BR>
are meaningless.
<BR>
<P>First of all, I believe that more recent brain
<BR>
research
<BR>
has raised doubt about this theory as to the physical
<BR>
cause of dreams. However, that doesn't matter.
<BR>
<P>Even if dreams ARE only the result of systems in the
<BR>
brain attempting to interpret random firings, it does
<BR>
not follow that dreams are meaningless. This should
<BR>
be obvious. Our dreams are not completely random;
<BR>
they aren't like tuning a TV to a dead channel. They
<BR>
can often be pretty muddled and incoherent, but on the
<BR>
other hand, dreams often involve describable things
<BR>
happening, and people doing this or that, etc.
<BR>
<P>It's as if somebody discovered that the ink blots
<BR>
used in Rorshack (sp?) tests were created by a random
<BR>
process, (&quot;We have discovered that they are merely
<BR>
ink blots&quot;) and therefore Rorshack tests are useless.
<BR>
But, of course, the whole point of using ink blots is
<BR>
that they ARE random. Since the ink blots contain
<BR>
no information, the subject undergoing the test is
<BR>
forced to put something of himself or herself into
<BR>
the description of them.
<BR>
<P>Likewise, if dreams are due to an attempt to interpret
<BR>
neuronal &quot;noise&quot;, the content of the dream still
<BR>
has to come from SOMEWHERE. From where else, if not
<BR>
from the mind of the dreamer?
<BR>
<P>Put another way, if someone tells you about a dream
<BR>
he had about George Washington crossing the Delaware,
<BR>
you HAVE learned something about that person, if only
<BR>
that he has heard of George Washington and knows
<BR>
that he crossed the Delaware*. The content of the
<BR>
dream has given you information about the person.
<BR>
Although I have used a trivial example, this is,
<BR>
in a nutshell, dream interpretation.
<BR>
<P>Dreams have content. That content must come from
<BR>
somewhere. A given theory of dream interpretation
<BR>
might be total rubbish, but it is obvious that
<BR>
the content of dreams reflect in some way the content
<BR>
of the mind of the dreamer.
<BR>
<P>Regardless of how kooky his theories might have been,
<BR>
Freud was a pioneer in that he attempted to apply
<BR>
a scientific spirit to the interpretation of dreams
<BR>
to learn something about the unconscious contents
<BR>
of the mind.
<BR>
<P><P>-- M. E. Smith
<BR>
<P><P>* If the dreamer HADN'T heard of Washington and
<BR>
his crossing of the Delaware, you'd have to start
<BR>
wondering about that collective unconscious stuff.
