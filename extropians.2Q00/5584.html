Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>This may have already been on the list but in just in case it wasn't I 
<BR>
reposted it from the Transhuman list.  These are exciting times!

<P>Folks, I've finally resolved the DNS mixup and other technical problems
<BR>
that have been delaying it. The following Transhuman Slash site is
<BR>
now open for beta testing:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.transhuman.memetree.com/">http://www.transhuman.memetree.com/</A>
<BR>
<P>As you'll see from the site's appearance, it's still all very &quot;Under
<BR>
Construction&quot;. Hopefully, together we can change that by submitting
<BR>
content, suggestions, and graphics.
<BR>
<P>What is Slash, you ask? It's software for running web-zines and
<BR>
web-logs.  It allows people to create free accounts, submit articles,
<BR>
append comments to articles, and vote on each other's comments. With
<BR>
time, and a history of contributions to the site, a user's reputation
<BR>
grows and they eventually get promoted to Author or Editor.
<BR>
<P>I'm hoping that some of the larger postings and the more short-term
<BR>
discussions that currently take place on this list will migrate to that
<BR>
site, freeing the list for low-volume, long-term discussion threads.
<BR>
So, go there, create an account for yourself, and have fun!
<BR>
<P>Other famous Slash sites include:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org">http://www.slashdot.org</A>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://nanodot.org">http://nanodot.org</A>
<BR>
<P>By the way, it's been rumored that the Extropy Institute is almost
<BR>
ready to roll out their own Slash site, done by two of the best
<BR>
webmasters/perl coders in the business.
