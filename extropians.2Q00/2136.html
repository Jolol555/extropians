<EM>&gt; Heh. Well, I know people who are learning Java, people who are teaching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Java, and people who are talking about Java. I've yet to find anyone who has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually built anything with Java, aside from the personal toy-project stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we all do to evaluate new technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>Through this list, you know one ex-lead engineer on a database search
<BR>
engine and visualization tool for annotations of genetic data, written
<BR>
entirely in Java (save for the database itself), that was going to be a
<BR>
company's leading product.  (Until said company's sales department
<BR>
caused its engineers to bail en masse.  I won't name names.)
<BR>
<P>I'm also working on a Zelda-style RPG, though it's not going to be done
<BR>
any time soon.  Although it is only a game, it's significantly beyond
<BR>
just evaluating the technology.  (It is, however, a good excuse to learn
<BR>
how to create music and sprites.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But it would be nice to be able to tell clients &quot;yes, we can communicate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with Java if you ever decide to use it for something&quot;. Its too bad Sun is so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intent on maintaining a closed system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Better to ask: &quot;What are you using Java for?&quot;  If, for instance, they've
<BR>
implemented a Web server using Java, anything that can speak HTTP can
<BR>
speak with that server, regardless of whether that other thing's creator
<BR>
knows anything about Java.
