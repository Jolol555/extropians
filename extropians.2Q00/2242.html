<EM>&gt; Regarding Billy's comments, I went and got some numbers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Covalent atomic bonds are usually in the range of 0.5-1.7 aJ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; von Neuman's classical limits on computer switching are kT ln 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ranging from 4.1x10^-3 aJ at room temps to 5.9x10^-5 aJ at lHe temp.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, if you represent a bond by a bit in a switch that can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flip at something close to the theoretical limits, you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simulate that bond using 3-4 orders of magnitude less energy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This makes sense because one is probably representing the bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as a single electron, atomic magnetic alignment, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Brillouin [1962] got a similar result using photons to detect holes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in punched tape (presumably related to the probability that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the photon can reliably cause a change in the energy level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an electron orbiting an atom.  This makes sense when you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consider that only UV photons have enough energy to break
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atomic bonds.
</EM><BR>
<P>I could nitpick by pointing out that you can't represent a bond with a
<BR>
single bit if you want a simulation with atomic-scale fidelity, but that's
<BR>
really beside the point. The key issue here is that you can simulate the
<BR>
bond using less energy that the actual bond takes to operate, but you can
<BR>
not get a further level of improvement by constructing a simulation of the
<BR>
simulation. Once you've built the most efficient simulation you know how to
<BR>
make, any further abstraction will increase your costs instead of reducing
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P>The implication is that the most efficient way to simulate anything is going
<BR>
to be a specialized simulation program running directly on physical
<BR>
hardware - IOW, something roughly analogous to existing simulation software.
<BR>
The data models used by the simulation may be extremely abstract and
<BR>
specialized, but they need to come as close as possible to being directly
<BR>
implemented in hardware. Adding anything else to the system (like a VR world
<BR>
running virtual hardware) would simply impose additional overhead and slow
<BR>
it down.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, if you can represent that bond by the position of a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; low energy photon in a photon &quot;gas&quot;, you can probably drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cost of the simulation even lower.
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably so, but we're still talking about a direct simulation here. What
<BR>
you're looking for is a way to make a simulation of a photon computer more
<BR>
efficient than an actual photon computer. I don't think you're going to find
<BR>
one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyone know the energy required to flip the magnetic alignment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of an atom?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think Frietas gives the equations in Nanomedicine, in the chapter on
<BR>
sensors, but I don't have my copy handy.
