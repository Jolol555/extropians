<P>
<EM>&gt; Speaking of unions . . .  My views on unions have evolved considerably over 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the last few years as I've become more and more libertarian in my political 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophy.  I don't see why people shouldn't be able to band together into 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collective bargaining arrangements or why a union shouldn't be able to make a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contract with a company that forbids the hiring of non-union employees.  Of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, state sanctioning shouldn't be tolerated, but I can see unions doing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lot of good in a more libertarian world, especially in taking over and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decentralizing many of the functions of the state social welfare function.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many of the things that anarcho-capitalist theorists see as being provided by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privately-produced law agencies would be more effective if coupled with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social welfare unions that also had some economic functions such as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collective bargaining.  Individuals would have to have the freedom to enter 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and leave unions (with some costs imposed, I'm sure).  I wonder what others 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think of such ideas?
</EM><BR>
<P>That's pretty much the (libertarian) party line, and I don't think anyone
<BR>
would much object.  We've always opposed so-called &quot;right to work&quot; laws
<BR>
that are basically government support of union breaking, and we've also
<BR>
opposed &quot;right to strike&quot; laws that were government support of unions.
<BR>
In short, let 'em fight it out for themselves.
<BR>
<P>I applaud recent moves, for example, of Doctors unionizing to fight
<BR>
restrictive HMO contracts.  Collective labor can be a strong force for
<BR>
fighting the power of big money in the absence of big government, and
<BR>
libertarians have always favored that. 
<BR>
