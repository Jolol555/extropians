<BR>
<EM>&gt; From: Damien Broderick &lt;<A HREF="mailto:d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au?Subject=Re:%20Cryonics%20&amp;%20psychopharmacology%20(Was:%20Our%20friend%20Sasha%20Chislenko%20is%20dead)&In-Reply-To=&lt;3928C32F@MailAndNews.com&gt;">d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Reading between the lines, I gather that Sasha took his own life. Even if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he'd had cryonics arrangements in place, I wonder if that fact might have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevented any cryonics organization from fulfilling his suspension.
</EM><BR>
<P>This could certainly have been a problem; even if the suicide itself
<BR>
didn't cause massive head injuries (as would be the case with a bullet 
<BR>
through the brain, a fall from from a high building etc.) and the ischemic 
<BR>
period following it were relatively short, then there would still be the
<BR>
problem of mandatory autopsy. In the best case this only means
<BR>
some more warm brain ischemia, in the worst case it means that the 
<BR>
brain is cut up into little pieces for &quot;investigation&quot;. Apparently this has
<BR>
really happened to at least one cryonicist. Needless to say, such
<BR>
procedures are completely barbaric just like the cremations and
<BR>
burials that usually follow them. Anyway, it's always better to
<BR>
freeze even a badly mutilated brain then allowing it to be completely
<BR>
destroyed, if only for the peace of mind of the patient's friends &amp; 
<BR>
family members. Even if current freezing techniques turn out
<BR>
to be completely useless, which isn't very likely imo, this
<BR>
peace of mind (for you and others) alone, as well as its
<BR>
symbolic (spit death in the face) and aesthetic (burning &amp;
<BR>
rotting are so very primitive and disgusting) value make cryonics 
<BR>
the top &quot;post-mortem&quot; choice for transhumanists and civilized 
<BR>
persons in general.
<BR>
<P>BTW, are you already signed up, Damien? ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Some of us might find it easy to empathize with the bone-deep despair that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can afflict a person, making suicide appear the only or at least the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plausible escape hatch. I suspect that quite a few people on this list are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prey to such affliction from time to time, because it is exactly those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are clear-sighted, smart and hence (usually) somewhat alienated from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rest of society who simultaneously suffer this anguish while strenuously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintaining the need for dynamic optimism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hear, hear...It helps to have strong transhumanist beliefs, though
<BR>
not always. In the end it's all about chemical (dis)balances, and
<BR>
mental illness can smash even the most rational belief system
<BR>
to bits. Fortunately, most of us can rely on good old cowardice
<BR>
to keep us from suicide. Apparently Sasha was no coward...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Probably the only way to guard against fatal attacks of despair is to live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; within a deeply connected community and/or family. Many of us are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; profoundly cut off from both. I would hope that we can find our way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develop such a caring community (and forgive me if, as a geographical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outsider, I'm misrepresenting extropian and &gt;H life in the States, Sweden
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and other places).
</EM><BR>
<P>The planned cryonics community in Arizona is definitely a move
<BR>
in the right direction. I hope it works out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But I also feel there needs to be some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technically-mediated way for a person finding himself or herself in such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wretchedness to step back for a while, allow the passage of time to do its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; healing (as it does, I know). Perhaps there are available drugs that do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this without making you stupid and numb. I don't know of any, but then I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fairly ignorant of psychopharmacology. Anyone here have anything to add to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my blurry suggestion?
</EM><BR>
<P>Before I became more or less chronically gay I used to smoke MJ
<BR>
when I got down. Worked like a charm; the more depressed I was
<BR>
before smoking, the better it worked. And, best of all, my good mood
<BR>
would last long after the drug's primary effects had worn off. Days,
<BR>
sometimes weeks or even longer. Also, MJ tends to get me mentally
<BR>
and physically alert, not &quot;dumb&quot; and slow. Anyway, that's my
<BR>
experience. It may not apply to everyone. Oh, and if you don't
<BR>
like smoking you can always vaporize the stuff, of course.
<BR>
<P>I also have some good experiences with Kava Kava (Piper
<BR>
methysticum). Its effects aren't as profound as those of MJ,
<BR>
but it does provide good overall mental stability and stress
<BR>
control. Unlike for example St. John's wort it has no (significant)
<BR>
known side effects.
