<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; That Omar -- such a naughty boy!  Omar Quadaffi?  Oh well, whoever he

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; is, he probably has a good block kicking coming, right?  Or else why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; would the U.S. be kicking his blocks?  Must be his fault.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Anyone who orders the bombing of a plane carrying hundreds of innocent people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; deserves to get his own house targeted by laser guided bombs...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Question: did he?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't believe we have enough evidence to draw that conclusion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We can be reasonably certain that the Libyan government made lots of loud
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; declarations in the early seventies about hosting liberation movements,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some of them of an extremely dodgy nature (and some of them rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less so).  And we _know_ that members of some of those organisations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did atrocious things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We are a little less certain that the Libyan government's own agencies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planted bombs/committed acts of terrorism abroad. Note also that a number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of US proxy states -- notably Israel and the UK -- have gone in for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this sort of action, too, up to and including assassination of foreign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nationals on foreign territory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But confirmation that Ghadaffi personally ordered foreign planes to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blown up in flight would be something of a bombshell. It's a bit like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blaming Ronald Reagan, personally, for the shooting down of that Iranian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Airlines DC-10 with nearly 300 passengers on board round about 1986.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And, if you're thinking about Lockerbie, it's worth bearing the alternative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theories in mind. (You know exactly who was _supposed_ to be on board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pan Am 109, but cancelled his party's reservation an hour before takeoff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and caught the next flight?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clue: here in Scotland, 90% of the informed opinion is that the Lockerbie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trial will deliver one of two verdicts -- &quot;not guilty&quot; or &quot;not proven&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I haddn't heard who was supposed to be on the flight, but I had heard
<BR>
that the defense had a supposed witness that claims a big US drug
<BR>
operation at the airport in question, who is most likely an IRA stalking
<BR>
horse (considering how much the IRA owes Gadaffi, I don't doubt it). I
<BR>
can't imagine that actual taped conversations of Gadaffi congradulating
<BR>
the team would not make it an open and shut case.
