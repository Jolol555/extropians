The debate over Elian is disgusting.  While I typed this message, around
<BR>
forty children died, thirty of them from starvation.  Militarily, at
<BR>
least, we have more than enough strength to go into those countries and
<BR>
knock over the tinpot dictators.  We don't.  Why?  Because it would
<BR>
upset the international teapot, give the US a big honkin' black mark in
<BR>
the UN's book, make *big* dictatorships like China extremely nervous,
<BR>
and up the probability of nuclear war by a few points.
<BR>
<P>The rule of international law and the threat of nuclear war is what
<BR>
keeps the US from rescuing all the little kids in China.  If, for
<BR>
reasons of either cowardice, or calculated risk, the US refuses to
<BR>
decide that our system is best and invade every non-democratic country
<BR>
on the planet, then children will continue to die, sacrificed in the
<BR>
name of international law.  And if we invade, kids will die too, of
<BR>
course.  I didn't say it was easy.  In fact, I'm not even advocating a
<BR>
decision one way or the other.  But making a big fuss about Elian, that
<BR>
innocent little telegenic child, while all over the planet people are
<BR>
starving to death even as the politicos spew their sugar-coated horse
<BR>
manure into the microphones, is pure headline-hungry hypocritical slime-grubbing.
<BR>
<P>If we took this opportunity to reevaluate, as a society, the moral pros
<BR>
and cons of invading China, that'd be one thing.  As it is, the whole
<BR>
debate stems from the simple fact that no elected politician in this day
<BR>
and age has the moral courage to stand up and say:  &quot;The little child,
<BR>
Elian Gonzalez, must be sacrificed on the alter of international law. 
<BR>
If we, as a society, want to reconsider our decision to put peace above
<BR>
innocent children, then we can do so afterwards.&quot;
