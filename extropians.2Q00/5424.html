<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Maybe I wasn't clear.  I'm looking at this question from a long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;view  perspective.  I don't think we'll invent nanotech on Monday
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and all the world's strategic, social, economic and political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems will be magically solved by Tuesday.  But if you believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nanotech is possible, it follows that eventually everything will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get exponentially cheaper, and will continue to do so until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;virtually everything (save perhaps terrestrial real estate) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;becomes free.
</EM><BR>
<P>You mean &quot;transparent&quot; don't you.
<BR>
<P>I understand nanotech, I have all the books, and have actually read
<BR>
them. I do believe it will make incredible things possible.
<BR>
Exponentially cheaper? Maybe... Free? No.....
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Your scenario of one person, corporation, government or group of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;governments forever hogging the benefits of nanotech to themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is pretty  unrealistic.  Once someone, *anyone*, has proven that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;practical control of nanotech is possible, *everyone* will devote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;every available resource to duplicating it.  It will, after all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be *the* best investment any corporation or government can make,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if the originator isn't sharing the wealth.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can easily imagine those in power deciding that for there own
<BR>
good, the general public should not have general nanotech. I can
<BR>
easily imagine posession of general nanotech being a capital
<BR>
offence. I can easily imagine the Rosie O'Donnels of the world
<BR>
marching in support of that proposition. 
<BR>
<P>Some people in this country lose their minds over the idea of
<BR>
handguns, and you think there going to let the public have access
<BR>
to general nanotech? 
<BR>
<P>Yes I believe general nanotech when created will possibly for
<BR>
centurys remain in the hands of a few.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As to whether there will be sufficient raw materials, if you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the power to manipulate matter at the atomic level *everything*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;becomes a raw material.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I remember correctly, Bucky Fuller designed the geodesic dome
<BR>
after a global inventory convinced him there was insufficient
<BR>
material in the world to build everyone an american style house.
<BR>
<P>What if everyone decided they had to have a dozen Taj Mahalls?
<BR>
<P><P>But the question is moot, because there is no way the powers that
<BR>
be will allow such tech in the hands of the many.
