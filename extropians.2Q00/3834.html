<P>Roger that.  Compare Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan. spike
<BR>
<P><P>Yes, it's really quite amazing that the intellectually gifted Carter could
<BR>
be such a dunderhead in the White House, while the less intelligent Reagan
<BR>
could be so brilliant.
<BR>
<P>Carter thought that the way to deal with exorbitant oil prices was to ration
<BR>
gasoline and spend billions of dollars trying to extract petrochemicals from
<BR>
tar sands. Neither scheme worked.
<BR>
<P>Reagan let the market set the price of oil, let the US economy go through a
<BR>
short, sharp recession to squeeze inflation out of the system, and changed
<BR>
the tax laws to encourage investment. The current boom is largely the result
<BR>
of this, and could not have started without Reagan's policies. Bill
<BR>
Clinton's economic success owes to the fact that he left almost all of
<BR>
Reagan's economic policies intact.
<BR>
<P>Carter said &quot;We have overcome our inordinate fear of communism.&quot;  Then he
<BR>
was shocked when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.
<BR>
<P>Regan called the USSR an &quot;evil empire&quot; and, addressing an audience next to
<BR>
the Berlin Wall, said &quot;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.&quot; Two years later,
<BR>
the people tore down the Wall and Gorbachev was soon kicked out of office.
<BR>
<P>Carter wins kudos for being a &quot;great&quot; ex-president. The tragedy is that
<BR>
Americans had to suffer through the Carter presidency first. Too bad he
<BR>
couldn't have gone directly from being elected to being an ex-president.
<BR>
<P>Now this self-righteous, incompetent prig can preen and preach all he likes,
<BR>
and we don't have to worry because his hands have been safely removed from
<BR>
the levers of power. When Carter speaks, I don't bother to listen.
<BR>
<P>Regards to all,
<BR>
