At 11:05 PM 28/06/00 -0500, Bonnie wrote off list but maybe it's of general
<BR>
interest:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What I REALLY wanted to know about Australia was [...]what happens when a
</EM><BR>
person
<BR>
<EM>&gt;needs medical care?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Gad, that was stupid of me. Um, I'm not sure how to answer this. There are
<BR>
`public hospitals' open to anyone who walks in (or is driven in with lights
<BR>
flashing, of course). You go to a triage nurse and sit down for quite a
<BR>
while, or get rushed upstairs quicksmart. Not unlike CHICAGO HOPE I guess.
<BR>
No charge to anyone. If you need more work done, they make you an
<BR>
appointment to see a specialist, sometimes months off. I've had surgery
<BR>
done this way at a couple of levels of complexity, with good results,
<BR>
although fuck-all personal hand-holding since they don't have time. 
<BR>
<P>For routine treatment, I have tended until recently to go to a doctor I
<BR>
built up a relationship with over some years; he kept a detailed history
<BR>
and knew me and my probs. This was at a Community health clinic, run by the
<BR>
local council at state expense. No charge; you sign a docket and the clinic
<BR>
gets paid the `common fee'. My brother the doctor hasn't liked this
<BR>
approach much, although these days he's working for an aboriginal medical
<BR>
service so I guess that's how he gets paid.
<BR>
<P>These days I go to a `bulk billing' private clinic up the road. You walk in
<BR>
off the street and wait half an hour or whatever and see the guy and he
<BR>
diagnoses/writes or renews scripts/does minor stuff with scalpel or dry ice
<BR>
or other rudimentary surgery. Again, this is paid for by signing a chit.
<BR>
I'm on a few drugs for blood pressure etc, and I pay $A20.60 a month for
<BR>
them (subsidised by the state). Antibiotics cost about the same for a
<BR>
course. I was flabbergasted to learn that you guys have to pay $100s.
<BR>
<P>Of course you can also take out private insurance, and get choice of
<BR>
doctor, slightly classier hospital beds, etc. If you suddenly die or
<BR>
approach it, they rush you to the public hospital anyway, where you lie
<BR>
next to some pauper and grit your teeth at all the $$ you wasted.
<BR>
<P>There's huge pressure from our conservative govt to get people into
<BR>
insurance, which is massively subsidised by kickbacks from the tax payer
<BR>
anyway. I can't see the point, there's damn-all `competition', and the
<BR>
prices keep soaring.
<BR>
<P>In the medium term all this will be changed by preventive procedures (just
<BR>
as putting kryptonite in the water supply has saved most kids from getting
<BR>
holes in their teeth, ever), targeted cures (like that virus-kills-cancers
<BR>
story just out), and more radically with nanomedicine. I hope. If I'm in
<BR>
luck, I'll just catch the forward wave. More likely I'll die next week or
<BR>
ten years from now, damn it to hell.
<BR>
<P>Damien B.
