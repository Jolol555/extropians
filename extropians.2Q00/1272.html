</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure how many types there are currently, but you can bet it
<BR>
is wrong.  As they are finding out with cancer, it can look like a
<BR>
duck and quack like a duck, but there are unrecognizable differences
<BR>
between individual duck-twins.  The only way to do this is
<BR>
through careful mRNA abundance statistical analysis on a cell by cell
<BR>
basis.  We are just at the start of being able to do this (by using
<BR>
lasers to destroy surrounding cells, so you can amplify the mRNA
<BR>
in the single remaining cell up to the detection level).  Doing this on
<BR>
frozen or cryo-preserved samples could be very misleading due to
<BR>
the stresses that occur prior to the sample being in stasis.
<BR>
Over the next 10 years or so, I suspect you will see the number of
<BR>
cell types climb.  I have &quot;heard&quot; [no reference] that ~25% of the
<BR>
genome is expressed in the brain.  This may be due to the difficulty
<BR>
of separating out different cell types (neuronal, glial, endothelial,
<BR>
etc.) from each other or it may be due to the fact that the brain is
<BR>
is simply a *very* complex organ.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3) Resolution required -- The spatial/chemical resolution of a scanning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology that would be required to sufficiently reliably distinguish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between the types of neurons, and to distinguish which neurons connect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to which others via which kinds of synapses.  (Assume one is repeated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slicing and scanning a cryogenically frozen brain.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
If the neurons have unique surface receptors, you can do this today
<BR>
using labeled antibodies.  The problem is that you need to know
<BR>
the information in (1) to know whether surface markers constitute
<BR>
unique sets or whether cells with different internal operations
<BR>
appear the same on the outside.  If you are slicing through cell
<BR>
interiors (as you describe), then you might be able to label internal
<BR>
molecules in a similar fashion and get a better understanding of the
<BR>
cell type.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure if you asked this question, but I think today's current
<BR>
scans are quite a way from the resolution I think is required.
<BR>
You could find out what the slice resolution was from the Brain Anatomy
<BR>
(Visible Brain?) project at NIH and then check cell sizes in Nanomedicine.
<BR>
I think you will find that the slices are much thicker than multiple cell
<BR>
layers and way above axon thicknesses (necessary to trace linkages).
<BR>
I don't envision any technologies improving on that much until
<BR>
real nanotech comes along unless someone gets really excited about
<BR>
applying MEMS micro-scalpels to the brain.
