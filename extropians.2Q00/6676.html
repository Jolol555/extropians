<P>One of the changes that comes with person centered values is &quot;Person First
<BR>
Language&quot;. Unfortunately, people are still debating about some parts of
<BR>
person first language.
<BR>
At one time, people with disabilities were referred to as &quot;patients&quot; or by
<BR>
their disability (&quot;epileptic&quot;). Today, people involved with disabilities see
<BR>
these as kind of rude labels because they tend to depersonalize someone into
<BR>
a stereotype and imply that the person is passive. In the 1950's people in
<BR>
human services began using the term &quot;client&quot; instead. Some people object to
<BR>
&quot;client&quot; because it implies a lower social or educational status for the
<BR>
person with a disability compared to the service provider. Many people use
<BR>
the term &quot;consumer&quot;, but some people also object to it because it implies
<BR>
someone who consumes and uses up resources. Some groups are using the term
<BR>
&quot;customer&quot;, to be part of the popular movement towards customer service and
<BR>
satisfaction. But even this term has people that object to it, who point out
<BR>
that people getting rehabilitation services do not purchase the services;
<BR>
the taxpayers or employers pay for it.
<BR>
The term &quot;disabled people&quot; or &quot;the disabled&quot; also has problems, since it
<BR>
suggests that their disability is the person's defining feature. Remember
<BR>
the first principle of person centered values? People can have a disability
<BR>
without being the disability. Labels that focus on limitations can be
<BR>
self-fulfilling - if someone thinks they are limited by their disability,
<BR>
they may give up and not even try new things. Because of this, a person can
<BR>
think they are more &quot;disabled&quot; than they truly are.
<BR>
In general, we should try to focus on the person and see both disabilities
<BR>
and abilities from their point of view, instead of from a medical definition
<BR>
or stereotype.

<BR>
<P>The language a society uses is reflective of its values. The term
<BR>
handicapped literally means cap in hand, a term coined during a time when
<BR>
society envisioned people with disabilities as only being capable of begging
<BR>
for a living. Times and our language have changed.
<BR>
People with disabilities prefer to be referred to with language that
<BR>
respects their humanity, abilities, talents and values. Person-first
<BR>
language recognizes a person's right to self esteem and to be addressed as a
<BR>
person first and not as disability. Referring to individuals with
<BR>
disabilities as &quot;the disabled&quot;, creates an image of a homogeneous and
<BR>
unusual group of persons. Terms such as these can be dehumanizing and
<BR>
perpetuate negative stereotypes about people with disabilities.

<BR>
<P>The only label a person needs is their name. Instead of labels, think of ALL
<BR>
people in terms of their strengths and abilities.
<BR>
<P>People with disabilities are &quot;People First&quot; and want the same things in life
<BR>
as people who don't have disabilities. All too often their gifts and
<BR>
abilities are not appreciated because our society has focused on their
<BR>
disability. Their disability is only part of who they are-not WHO they are.
<BR>
How many of us want to be described only in terms of the things we cannot
<BR>
do? Our language reflects our attitudes toward diversity. A first step to
<BR>
changing attitudes is changing the way we speak about people.
<BR>
Labels are extremely powerful. Don't let a person's disability become his
<BR>
label. Say &quot;student who has a disability&quot; rather than a &quot;disabled student.&quot;
<BR>
It makes the student more important than the disability!
<BR>
<P>from &lt; <A HREF="http://www.dpa.org.sg/DPA/publication/dpajul99/p20.htm">http://www.dpa.org.sg/DPA/publication/dpajul99/p20.htm</A> &gt;
<BR>
<P>I believe many forces are to blame for inappropriate language. For instance,
<BR>
many people see or hear terms such as 'handicapped parking' and assume that
<BR>
it's okay in everyday speech. Others were raised during a time when
<BR>
'cripple' and 'invalid' were considered proper terminology. More recently,
<BR>
we have the PC, or politically correct, movement. It was PC that gave us
<BR>
jewels such as 'handicapable', 'differently abled' and the ever-popular
<BR>
'physically challenged'. It's funny - I don't remember being a part of the
<BR>
committee that voted yes to these.
<BR>
Last, and certainly least, we have many members of the disability community
<BR>
itself who care little about what they're called. Many individuals tell me
<BR>
&quot;you can't take that stuff too seriously&quot; or &quot;what difference does it make?&quot;
<BR>
Sadly, perhaps in an attempt to show society that they're not bitter, they
<BR>
sell us out.
<BR>
The importance of using person-first language can hardly be stressed enough.
<BR>
Placing the person before the wheelchair, cane or speech difficulty
<BR>
accomplishes two things. First, by stressing the person, it emphasizes inner
<BR>
qualities that anyone might have, and de-emphasizes physical appearance. It
<BR>
also normalizes the disability by sending the subtle message that a
<BR>
disability can happen to anyone. Compare that to 'wheelchair person' which
<BR>
has sort of a space-alien feel to it.
<BR>
Language affects attitudes. Legislation defending the rights of the
<BR>
disability community might be easier to enforce if everyone saw the person
<BR>
first.
<BR>
The phrase 'everyone's disabled in some way' should not be excused either.
<BR>
This is an error in logic known as equivocation, or the changing of a term's
<BR>
definition in midstream. One minute, we're referring to a disability such as
<BR>
blindness; the next minute we're equating it to forgetfulness, or being 20
<BR>
pounds overweight. The person who does this usually finds the disability
<BR>
intimidating. Reducing the seriousness of the disability makes it easier to
<BR>
handle.
<BR>
So, what can a person with a disability do against the formidable foes of
<BR>
assertiveness and patience. When someone you meet uses inappropriate
<BR>
language, do you politely correct them, or do you accept their ignorance and
<BR>
confusion as excuses? If you do correct them, do you explain why it's
<BR>
important?
<BR>
Every time a person refrains from being assertive, they are, in effect,
<BR>
saying, &quot;It doesn't really matter what you call me.&quot; Correcting someone may
<BR>
not be comfortable, but it's the right thing to do. If that person is
<BR>
secure, he or she will not react defensively. If they do, you must realize
<BR>
that it is not your problem.
<BR>
Any time members of a minority group speak out on an issue relating to them,
<BR>
they run the risk of being labelled as bitter, obsessed, maladjusted or
<BR>
hypersensitive. These labels are merely a sign of society's unease. Labels
<BR>
take the place of true understanding, while also discrediting the person
<BR>
presenting the issue.
