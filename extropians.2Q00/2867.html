<P>Sasha preferred the notion of uploading himself into a world-wide computer
<BR>
network.  Whether or not this seems more or less feasible to you, it was
<BR>
his dream.  He was neither frozen nor uploaded, so the only way he is not
<BR>
totally lost is if we remember him and honor him and don't let the world
<BR>
forget him.
<BR>
<P><P>I agree that, most likely, continuation of Sasha's ideas depends on us. But
<BR>
there may be other ways, too, including the one Sasha wanted most of all.
<BR>
<P>On Sasha's website is a quotation from the Dalai Lama (excerpted from the
<BR>
book &quot;Gentle Bridges&quot;) that I sent him. In it, the DL states that it may be
<BR>
possible for a person who has worked with a sufficiently advanced computer
<BR>
for long time to essentially reincarnate into the machine. At least, the DL
<BR>
believes that this is a possibility within the Tibetan Buddhist philosophy
<BR>
he has been taught. But he admits that we must wait and see if this can
<BR>
actually be done.
<BR>
<P>I doubt that our computational devices are capable of hosting human-level
<BR>
information processing yet. That being said, there is a part of me that
<BR>
hopes that somewhere, on a Net-connected machine, Sasha's mind still lives.
<BR>
