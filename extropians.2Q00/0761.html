<EM>&gt; Ja, however we dont have that design any more.  It is folklore in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space industry which I have been trying to confirm or overturn for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years.  According to the legend, after the end of the Saturn V production
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run, the drawing package was not only not preserved, it was intentionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destroyed, so we couldn't build one now even if we wanted to.  A reliable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source has told me that at least part of the package still exists in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; archives at Johnson, but he could not confirm that it was all there.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've heard much the same.  Saturn V is not the only proven technology that
<BR>
one could &quot;reuse.&quot;  Aside from other American rocket models, there are
<BR>
Soviet era ones too that could be worked over -- as opposed to reinventing
<BR>
the rocket.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another source claims that the drawing package was not fully up to date
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever; that skilled craftsmen knew how to make certain parts and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these tricks were never entered into the drawings back in the go-go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rush of the 1960s, altho this latter part strains the imagination.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps, though I suspect a lot of this could be reverse engineered.  It
<BR>
would probably be much easier than coming up with a whole new design.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That sure wouldnt fly today.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not so sure.  Documentation is often slip shod at any company -- even
<BR>
ones claiming to use ISO 900x.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The conspiracy theorist hold that the Saturn V drawings were destroyed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in order to prevent the Saturn V from being considered a competitor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the space shuttle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect a more likely explanation is that no one awarded a contract
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to preserve the drawings and so North American Rockwell, et. al. didnt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anybody know?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not me.
