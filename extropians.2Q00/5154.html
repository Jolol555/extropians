<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                       June 13, 2000
<BR>
<P>BACK TO THE GARDEN:  NASA GOES FROM PLANTS TO PLANETS
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA scientists have gone back to the garden, &quot;planting&quot; 
<BR>
wireless webs of small sensors in gardens here on Earth in 
<BR>
preparation for missions to help monitor biological activity on 
<BR>
planets.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensor webs like those being tested will help make possible 
<BR>
a key NASA goal to establish a virtual presence for exploration 
<BR>
throughout the solar system. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., and the 
<BR>
Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, San 
<BR>
Marino, Calif., have joined forces to study micro-climates, 
<BR>
placing webs in the various specialized gardens at the 
<BR>
Huntington.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like satellites and telescopes remotely &quot;measuring&quot; planets 
<BR>
across the vast reaches of space, the webs allow large areas to 
<BR>
be monitored.  Unlike remote operations, sensor webs are placed 
<BR>
inside the environment  thus making them capable of on-site 
<BR>
detection not possible from afar.  For example, satellite 
<BR>
measurements cannot penetrate deep below the ocean surface or 
<BR>
detect extremely small quantities of gases coming off a planetary 
<BR>
surface. The sensor webs could combine the spatial coverage of a 
<BR>
satellite with the precision of an on-site instrument. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sensor webs offer us the means to make sensitive 
<BR>
measurements over large areas,&quot; said Dr. Kevin Delin, leader of 
<BR>
the Sensor Webs Project at JPL.  &quot;A major thrust of our current 
<BR>
effort is to develop a sensor web that can detect, identify and 
<BR>
monitor any biological activity.  For example, trace biosignature 
<BR>
gases are very important if you are a biogeochemist trying to 
<BR>
understand the carbon cycle on Earth or searching for 
<BR>
microorganisms living beneath the surface of a planet.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sensor web consists of a number of small pods, each 
<BR>
housing transducers that collect data from the environment and 
<BR>
communication chips that move the data around the web to primary 
<BR>
pods. The information is then transmitted to the Internet or an 
<BR>
overhead satellite. &quot;Hopping&quot; the data in short distances from 
<BR>
pod to pod makes the overall data transmission more energy 
<BR>
efficient.  In addition, the &quot;hopped&quot; data is shared by all of 
<BR>
the pods, allowing each one to know what is being collected 
<BR>
elsewhere on the web.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pods that are being tested monitor local temperature, 
<BR>
humidity, soil moisture, and light levels. Initial observations 
<BR>
will take place in a controlled greenhouse environment, then 
<BR>
progress to a nursery, and on to overlapping microclimate areas.  
<BR>
Pods are housed in small plastic containers about the size of a 
<BR>
sandwich box. Other sensor web pods developed by Delin and 
<BR>
Shannon Jackson, also of JPL and lead engineer on the project, 
<BR>
look much like a gumball toy, but contain specialized 
<BR>
instruments.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Huntington Botanical Gardens is a &quot;perfect place,&quot; says 
<BR>
Delin, to field test the sensor web since there are varied garden 
<BR>
environments in the 150-acre grounds that reflect many different 
<BR>
micro-climates, from desert to semi-tropical to cool.  &quot;We are 
<BR>
quite fortunate to be able to work with the staff at the 
<BR>
Huntington Gardens to test our system, since they are so 
<BR>
experienced in botanical research,&quot; Delin said.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This collaboration between institutions is mutually 
<BR>
beneficial, according to James Folsom, Director of the Botanical 
<BR>
Gardens.  &quot;It's always great to work with the scientists from 
<BR>
JPL, even more so in this instance.  The Huntington's staff sees 
<BR>
remarkable potential for the development of these sensors, in 
<BR>
both field study and gardens management.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another advantage to wireless sensor webs is the easy 
<BR>
replacement of modules when sensor instruments degrade or 
<BR>
batteries fail.  New modules, including primary ones, can be 
<BR>
added to the sensor web at any time.  Multiple webs deployed in a 
<BR>
given area will easily mesh with each other. On Earth, webs could 
<BR>
be dropped from an airplane, while for other bodies in the solar 
<BR>
system the webs could be released from spacecraft, fired from a 
<BR>
lander, or dropped from a small rover.  Another possibility is 
<BR>
ballistically driving the modules into the steep sides of a 
<BR>
canyon for measurements in inaccessible areas.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Huntington is a private, nonprofit research and cultural 
<BR>
center serving both scholars and the general public. The 
<BR>
institution is dedicated to the study of history, literature, 
<BR>
art, science and culture, as well as botanical research and 
<BR>
education. The Botanical Gardens were first developed in 1903. 
<BR>
About 15,000 kinds of plants from all over the world make up the 
<BR>
botanical collections, many landscaped into a series of theme 
<BR>
gardens.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology, 
<BR>
Pasadena.
