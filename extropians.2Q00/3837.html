<P>
In what must be a shocking change in standard government behavior, a federal tax
<BR>
has actually been repealed, as described in this excerpt from a weekly
<BR>
newsletter email to me from Rep. Charlie Bass (R-NH):
<BR>
<P>Eliminating the Spanish-American War Telephone Tax
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House voted this week, with my support, to eliminate the federal
<BR>
telephone tax paid by every New Hampshire resident with a phone.  The
<BR>
federal excise tax on your phone bill was first enacted in 1898 to finance
<BR>
the Spanish-American War.  The war ended that same year, but the telephone
<BR>
tax has endured several attempts over the years to phase it out or scale it
<BR>
back.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was a luxury tax 100 years ago has become a regressive burden
<BR>
on one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy and hits every family
<BR>
in this country with a telephone including a dedicated Internet telephone
<BR>
line.  The Phone Tax Repeal Act (H.R. 3916) would repeal the three percent
<BR>
tax, which would encourage growth in the advanced communications sectors and
<BR>
give all Americans a break on their phone bills.
<BR>
&lt;end excerpt&gt;
<BR>
<P>Can you beleive it folks? Its certainly good to see more positive things
<BR>
happening in the Dirty Capital. However, Chuck didn't mention one minor detail
<BR>
of the repeal: its gonna take TWO YEARS for it to stop showing up on your phone
<BR>
bills...(obviously long enough for everyone to safely get re-elected)
<BR>
