</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well ;) ), so you could say i got that for free. But I doubt that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people are as cheap as I am. Both are 'previous release' issues, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've likewise seen Windows 3.1 and Win95 disks available for nothing or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; next to nothing in similar venues...Buying the latest release of an OS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is not likely to be gotten for free or next to nothing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes it is. You can always download the latest version of RedHat, SuSE,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mandrake, Debian, Slackware, and all the others I could come up with, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; obtain the CD for $2-3.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The issue isn't downloads, its hardcopy, and I'd be very interested in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; finding sources of cds for 2-3 dollars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.cheapbytes.com">http://www.cheapbytes.com</A> is a good US source. Most of the major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distributions can be had for $1.99
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 100M or more, especially if your local phone usage rates are not capped,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is less than going out and buying the CD.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not if you're in the UK :(
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I actually intended to say that its NOT less. A long download of a
<BR>
day will play havoc with your local phone bill (even some parts of the
<BR>
US, Vermont for example, and some local account types in NH, both have
<BR>
metered local phone rates of between $0.01-0.04 per minute.
<BR>
<P>Assuming a download speed of 33.6 in a rural location where local access
<BR>
is metered (I've never gotten as much as 33.6 with my 33.6 modem in this
<BR>
area, 31.4 is the best I've seen, and 56k is not 'really' 56k in many
<BR>
areas). So thats 33,600 bits per second. Lets assume a 100Megabyte
<BR>
download (anyone suggest if this is inaccurate) which is actually what?
<BR>
800,000,000 bits or thereabouts? 100,000 bits every three seconds
<BR>
(assuming no erroneous packets) you are talking about 24,000 seconds to
<BR>
download, or 400 minutes, almost 7 hours. 400 minutes is between $4.00
<BR>
and 8.00 in line charges alone, at best, for a local metered call. Then
<BR>
you are dealing with lost opportunity costs of having your phone tied up
<BR>
for almost 7 hours, and you are assuming that the transfer doesn't get
<BR>
bunged up and quitted on you. Adjust this $4-8 figure for each 100megs
<BR>
of download.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Knowing cd production costs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they are losing money distributing at that rate. Moreover, the business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; models of companies like these are focused on making money on tech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; support. I doubt very much that half of the linux companies will be in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; business in a year or two.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Probably a lot will die off, but that's the free market :). The open source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business model is viable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Corel is a rather unusual example (it includes some commercial software,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; namely the personal version of WordPerfect).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, and Corel is also coming out with linux versions of all of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; applications. It intends to give Microsoft a run for its money through a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; user freindly version of the linux platform and a full linux product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; line, so long as they don't run out of money first. Michael Cowpland,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; CEO fo Corel, seems to be afflicted with the gee-whiz virus, and even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; though they are short onf cash, went ahead and bought Kai, at the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; time that they are finalizing their Borland/Inprise merger. He is doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; little to improve existing applications, preferring a strategy of making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; applications pay for their own improvements. Ventura, for example, is in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; many ways a superior DTP application to Quark, PageMaker, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; FrameMaker, but lacks some features that I consider to be of utmost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; importance to be truly wonderful (though few other DTP apps offer them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; either, and in the rare cases they do, they are expensive aftermarket
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; plug-ins from third parties.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sun have produced StarOffice, which is fully compatible with MS Office
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and free for personal non-commercial use. It's distributed with several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the Linux distributions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, but its not fully comparable, feature for feature. It only has
<BR>
file format compatibility. And don't get me started on the differences
<BR>
between WP and Word.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With a combination of StarOffice and, say, Mandrake or SuSE, I think Linux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is already a very viable desktop alternative to Windows for a lot more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people than many realise.
</EM><BR>
<P>I use SO on my SuSe implementation, and its useful, no doubt about it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I would add Corel to that list, but their distribution is currently a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little quirky - I look forward to the next version).
</EM><BR>
<P>The 'quirky' comment I've heard elsewhere, mostly because the header
<BR>
normally found in Debian is not present. It can be put back in with no
<BR>
problem, but the point of the Corel implementation was to make it easily
<BR>
installable by a newbie on an average desktop machine. There are issues
<BR>
with SCSI drivers, which is typical with many linux installs. My
<BR>
impression that the 'quirky' comment is just a rumor spread around by
<BR>
die hard command line junkies who are offended that a linux install
<BR>
should be so easy.
