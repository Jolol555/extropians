<EM>&gt; I admit that nations sometimes with bad/greedy/mistrustful leadership do

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the truth of the old saying &quot;a nation gets the government it deserves.&quot;  And 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this applies whether you are talking about the people of the U.S., Iraq or

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am proud to be a citizen of the United States of America.  I realize my

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corrected.
</EM><BR>

<BR>
Maybe my perceptions are coloured by just having finished reading a
<BR>
history of the first world war; but patriotism is a particularly dangerous
<BR>
emotion -- especially when it's directed outward and expressed as contempt
<BR>
for those who _don't_ do everything the way we do it over here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Still, I am proud of what the founding fathers did in giving us such a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brilliant foundation to build on.  And I am proud of the great progress 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which has been made in terms of civil rights, technological development, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; military power (sometimes very rightly used such as in WWII) and the way we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have built a strong and relatively efficient commercial sector.
</EM><BR>

<BR>
I'm not going to try and kick holes in your parade; as a foreigner, 
<BR>
any such act would tend to be misinterpreted. However, I'd like to note
<BR>
in passing that _no_ country today is a utopia, or has abolished poverty,
<BR>
or has abolished civil rights abuses. Some are better than others, but
<BR>
that's as far as it goes -- and even then, the relative position varies
<BR>
depending on your status within your own culture. 
<BR>
<P>I'd also like to note that from a non-American perspective making children
<BR>
swear an oath of alliegence in school each day looks positively Orwellian,
<BR>
and I don't see massive military power as being admirable, either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think a rational patriotism is not anti-extropian.  Any thoughts on this, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gentleman and ladies?  Nations, at least at the present time, are an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overarching organizational structure for humanity.  It is what we have to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work with, and so we should each do our best to work within it, to make 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; positive changes.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
For starters, nationalism -- which is inextricably linked with patriotism --
<BR>
is deeply anti-libertarian. _Any_ ideology that tries to fit people into
<BR>
pigeon-holes is to some extent anti-extropian, and nationalism, which in
<BR>
extreme cases subordinates the individual to the state, is exactly that.
<BR>
For seconds, it amounts to an unpleasant delegation of the divine right
<BR>
of kings to the national government. Back before the age of enlightenment,
<BR>
kings ruled by divine fiat. Now we don't have kings, so we have nations to
<BR>
which we're supposed to be loyal. Why? What do they do to deserve such
<BR>
loyalty? A social contract is all very well, but when it pulls on jack-
<BR>
boots and starts marching over the border it's time to ask some searching
<BR>
questions.
<BR>
<P>The national system we've been bequeathed is just a degenerate form of the
<BR>
monarchical system, with the powers devolved to a national level which is
<BR>
just a replacement for the Crown. And I don't hear any extropian monarchists
<BR>
out there ...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps in time, technological advances in such areas as nanotech, AI and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longevity will produce a population that will want and get a much more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'libertarian' approach to governments and nations. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Attention: fundamental-change-in-human-nature alert!
<BR>
<P>(Yeah, maybe. I'd like to see it happen. But colour me skeptical in the 
<BR>
short term.)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Charlie, you spoke of war.  WWI might be looked at as a 'civil war' within 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the European world.  As some citizens (especially in third world nations) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; begin to gain power through the coming technologies, they may have a fervent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desire to break away from corrupt, murderous and power-hungry governments.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We may see some very vicious civil wars and insurgencies as people rise up 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to get away from or overthrow oppressive governments, in the desire to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replace them with something very different.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I fervently hope that in the first world and especially in the United 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; States, that dialogue and change can be done in productive and peaceful 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ways.  Rather then an elimination of the U.S. government, I see changes that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would simply reduce its size and influence, while handing over much more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power to the people.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I agree with you about the hope -- but I'm not optimistic. People with
<BR>
vested interests in the existing system don't welcome change unless it is
<BR>
clearly going to benefit them. We also see signs of really irrational
<BR>
behaviour in existing fields; see, for example, the conduct of the war
<BR>
on drugs. (It doesn't make sense, but it's _still_ going on.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of course, for those who feel this is far too compromising, there will in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the future the option to go to the oceans or also outer space to found the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; type of communities that radical libertarians and extropians dream of.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wish you all luck and in time may join you, but for now please understand if 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I feel pride and a touch of emotion when I see the American flag waving in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the wind.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose for me the acid test is, do you feel pride and a touch of
<BR>
emotion when US Navy ships fire cruise missiles at factories in some
<BR>
other country because of a rumour (no more!) that they're supplying
<BR>
nasty raw materials to a third party?
<BR>
<P>Being proud of having built something good is one thing. Being proud
<BR>
of having the ability to kick someone else's work over is something
<BR>
else ...
