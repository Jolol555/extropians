<EM>&gt; Specific statements that caught my eye:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.  &quot;... senses of smell, taste, touch, sight and hearing have decreased at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a rate of nearly one percent per year.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
It is generally true that sensory perception does decline with age
<BR>
among gerontologists.  For example, the elderly generally have poor
<BR>
nutrition.  This is attributed in part to a decreased ability to
<BR>
smell and taste the food.  It is less appealing so people eat less.
<BR>
Eyesight and hearing are well documented to decrease with age.
<BR>
I'm not sure how much of the eyesight decrease is neural in nature
<BR>
because you would have to separate out the decrease in the transparency
<BR>
and flexibility of the lens.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not entirely sure that we have eliminated the capacity.  We do know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that people who listen to loud music (usually rock music) have a decreased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; auditory sense, but I'm not sure that this applies to everyone.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that the declines are fairly universal.  If you want some
<BR>
concrete references, send me a note off-list and I'll go through
<BR>
my gerontology books when I get back to Seattle.  The &quot;Baltimore
<BR>
Longitudinal Study on Aging&quot; would be the place to start for
<BR>
pysiological changes in the general population with age.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.	&quot;Our brain is not adapting.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I would probably disagree with that.  There is general consensus that
<BR>
the brain does adapt and replace decreased sensory perception with
<BR>
accumulated knowledge regarding the information that is likely to be
<BR>
present.  Perhaps the type of adaption they were seeking does not
<BR>
occur.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3.	&quot;Red is no longer real red.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not going to touch that statement since it will likely restart
<BR>
the qualia wars... :-)
<BR>
<P>As a general comment I would say that it is clear that we are losing
<BR>
neurons with age.  This was at first believed, then refuted and now
<BR>
with very very good techniques is believed to be true for normal
<BR>
aging in individuls.  I don't recall the exact figures, but the loss is
<BR>
significant enough that you do have to worry about having half-a-brain
<BR>
when you get into the multi-hundreds of years age-group.  So one of
<BR>
the problems we will need to solve to get bio-humans into the thousand
<BR>
year lifespan era will be the implantation and outgrowth of neuronal
<BR>
stem cells.  However it would be really strange if the singularity
<BR>
did not arrive for most of the people on the planet long before they
<BR>
are needed.
