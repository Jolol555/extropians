<P><EM>&gt; &gt; So what's the answer, peeling off the bandaid and tossing it aside?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Granted, a bandaid on a gaping chest wound will not solve the problem.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will stepping over the patient and looking the other way do any better?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think the hard part that a lot of people are unwilling to accept is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there will be casualties.  If you are serious about changing the system,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there *will* be a fraction of the population that won't make the cut for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;social triage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The situation is complicated in that the bandaid is often responsible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in part for the injury inflicted.  What is the point of creating the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bandaid if one is still willing to inflict the injury in the first place?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Part of the problem is that this issue is often presented at as a &quot;bandaid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or no bandaid&quot; decision by politicians rather than a &quot;prevention or cure&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;issue, largely because politicians with bandaids are viewed as &quot;solutions&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rather than as being part of the problem.  Real solutions would require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tacit admissions by politicians and the government to a lot of things they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would rather not admit to.  And being in positions of power, they don't,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which is why we have lots of bandaids and no real solutions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't get me wrong, I'm no big fan of the welfare state.  I work hard for my 
<BR>
living 5 (sometimes 6, sometimes 7) days a week.  I'm certainly not looking 
<BR>
for big brother to give me or my family any handouts and I would probably 
<BR>
benefit as much as anybody else from a nice fat tax cut.  But I think there 
<BR>
is a middle road between the ad infinitum welfare state and the immediate 
<BR>
end of the dole (which is what would lead to the &quot;casualties&quot; you seem to so 
<BR>
easily dismiss).
<BR>
<P>I think its obvious that there needs to be a nice plump carrot, as well as a 
<BR>
nice thick stick.  Telling people that &quot;the good ol' welfare days are over, 
<BR>
see ya later and rotsa ruck&quot; is just going to create a huge drain on society 
<BR>
that will be good for nobody.  I for one am not going to sit still and watch 
<BR>
American kids starving in the streets.
<BR>
<P>You want to end welfare?  OK, so do I.  But you have to give people the 
<BR>
means with which to make their own way in the world.  If I'm ignorant, poor, 
<BR>
uneducated and unskilled and you kick me and my kids out into the streets to 
<BR>
starve, you have de facto turned me into a criminal.  I will rob everyone in 
<BR>
sight.  I will soon be caught and put in jail then, guess what?  Free room 
<BR>
and board on your dime again.  Nice solution.
