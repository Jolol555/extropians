<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt;The new guy is alive, but I'm still dead.  We are identical, except
</EM><BR>
I'm
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt;dead and he's not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not exactly sure what a &quot;consciousness stream&quot; is but it doesn't
</EM><BR>
seem to me that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it's been interrupted and surely you don't think the atoms are
</EM><BR>
important, I doubt you want
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to invoke an immortal soul; so what has changed so much that the fellow
</EM><BR>
who believes
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with every fiber in his being that he's good old Harvey Newstrom is
</EM><BR>
actually wrong?
<BR>
<P>To you, the original and the copy are identical.  You can't tell them apart.
<BR>
Therefore you think they are interchangeable.  And they are, for your
<BR>
purposes.
<BR>
<P>For my purposes, there is an obvious difference between the two.  I could
<BR>
never get them confused.  I can perceived the thoughts of the original &quot;me&quot;.
<BR>
I cannot perceive the thoughts of the new &quot;me&quot;.  I can control the actions
<BR>
of the original &quot;me&quot;.  I cannot control the actions of the new &quot;me&quot;.  The
<BR>
original &quot;me&quot; is always here and is never disconnected.  The new &quot;me&quot; is
<BR>
over there, it is never connected.  I know that I am alive, because &quot;I
<BR>
think, therefore I am.&quot;  I can't tell if the new me is alive, because I am
<BR>
not sure what it is thinking or if it is just claiming to think it is me.  I
<BR>
know I am alive, because I am still thinking.  If the new &quot;me&quot; goes out of
<BR>
sight, it can be killed without my knowledge.  I have no way to know if it
<BR>
is alive or dead.
<BR>
<P>Not only can I easily tell the difference between the old and new &quot;me's&quot;, I
<BR>
could never get them confused.  My perception of the old and new &quot;me's&quot; are
<BR>
so radically different, that they are not even similar.  Until I perceive
<BR>
the new &quot;me&quot; as being here, connected, and functioning under my control, I
<BR>
don't see how I could ever perceive it as &quot;me&quot;.
