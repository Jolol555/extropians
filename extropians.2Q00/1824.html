<EM>&gt; excuses for further government meddling. History shows that government is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not fit to judge what products consumers what, how much they should cost,

<EM>&gt; how they should be bundled, or what technologies should be used to build

<EM>&gt; perfect results, but it does give us steady improvement over time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Government intervention, OTOH, simply replaces voluntary choices with a

<P>I fully agree that the US government would/will be incompetent at this
<BR>
task. However, whether or not Microsoft complies with any regulations set
<BR>
by the US government is neither my point or an issue that concerns me (I
<BR>
do not live in the US, and I do not use Microsoft's products).
<BR>
<P>However, there are very competent bodies who set out open industry
<BR>
standards for software, hardware and the Internet.
<BR>
<P>And you know what? I'm not even suggesting Microsoft has to use them!
<BR>
They are more than welcome to go off and use their own proprietary
<BR>
standards instead.
<BR>
<P>What I *really* object to is the way they take the standards, claim they
<BR>
are using them, and then produce their own broken implementation, add their
<BR>
own undocumented features, and use their position to make sure those
<BR>
changes get spread and used, causing incompatibilities everywhere.
<BR>
<P>The modern world is *utterly dependent* on its IT infrastructure. The
<BR>
days when a few commercial entities could be entrusted with it should be
<BR>
long past. I have no objection to Microsoft writing and selling their
<BR>
software, and making a hell a lot of money out of it. But they don't
<BR>
have any right to make things difficult for those (who are *not*
<BR>
competitors of theirs) trying to ensure people have the freedom to use
<BR>
whichever tools they wish to make use of the infrastructure, for
<BR>
whatever reason (such as because Microsoft's are buggy and insecure).
