<P><P>NYPD doesn't use or allow &quot;cop killer&quot; bullets.  They have been using
<BR>
ordinary 147gr 9mm for years, although I think they recently moved to 115gr
<BR>
+P 9mm, both of which are easily stopped by light body armor.  NYPD cops
<BR>
are required to use the organization standard ammo and firearms.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Cop killer&quot; bullets were never mass produced and never mass issued; they
<BR>
were largely a design curiousity in the shops of ammo manufacturers. 
<BR>
These types of bullets often proved to be very poor at stopping people
<BR>
and great at putting innocent people at risk via over-penetration. 
<BR>
Over-penetration *is* an important issue for defensive ammunition. 
<BR>
Hollowpoint bullets were originally designed in an attempt to protect
<BR>
bystanders from excessive penetration.
