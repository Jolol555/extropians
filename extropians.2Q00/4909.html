<P>
I've kept written journals of my life since I was 13 or 14.  Unfortunately I
<BR>
burned the earliest stuff because my mother was going into my room and
<BR>
reading my private papers.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;When I read the stuff I wrote when I was in my early 20's, I'm amazed at
<BR>
how stable my basic philosophy has been over the years.  I'm also amazed at
<BR>
how my memory of specific events changes over time.  In some cases, the
<BR>
change is due to a new interpretation I give past events as a result of
<BR>
gaining knowledge I didn't have before. In other cases, I remember certain
<BR>
moments clearly but separately from the context of daily life in which they
<BR>
were embedded when they occurred.
<BR>
<P>I've loved being a whole series of slightly different people, united by this
<BR>
basic philosophy.  I sometimes wonder what it would be like if I could have
<BR>
all these different &quot;selves&quot;--the little child self, the teenaged self, the
<BR>
young-adult self, etc. in a room with each other at the same time.  I think
<BR>
they'd like each other.  I wonder if anyone has some &quot;selves&quot; that wouldn't
<BR>
get along well with their other &quot;selves.&quot;
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>Didn't Vernor Vinge posit the question of identity with his Singularity
<BR>
analogy; &quot;Does the sperm still exist after it unites with the egg?&quot; Very
<BR>
Zen-sounding.  If the technology works as well as we all hope, to the
<BR>
capacity we all hope, then keeping a
<BR>
&quot;veriform appendix&quot; of self , or being that veriform appendix of self is a
<BR>
great idea. When a person goes through an intense event, such as war, are
<BR>
they same person? Yes and no is the correct answer. People can change over
<BR>
time (personality-wise) so it seems to be a healthy objective to check one's
<BR>
goals and see if we are still moving where we originally felt we needed o
<BR>
be.
