<EM>&gt; &gt; What strikes me as amazing is just how many times I've run into people 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; associations with Rome, GA, where I mispent most of my youth.  For a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;town of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; about 30,000 (probably more now), Rome and people from there show up 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; often in the news than perhaps any other town of that size.  Have you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; noticed this as well?  Any theories?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Notta one.  Just noticed that one of the papers at the Journal of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Transhumanism is from at professor at Berry College, though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And the president of the American Library Association (one of the largest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;professional organizations in the country) a few years back grew up in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Rome.  I had the *enourmously* amusing priveledge to see him welcomed as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conquering hero by they city library...to be told this was the first time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he ever set foot in it becasue he is black, and they weren't allowed in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the library back then.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Did anyone clue you into why Rome was famous?  At one point they had the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; highest ratio of cars to people in the entire world.  However, the city
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fathers didn't get around to mentioning why.  Turns out that Rome was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bootleg capital of the SouthEast during prohibition.  When that petered 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they had all these experts at sooping up cars and rebuilding them with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fake
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gas tanks, etc., all looking for something to do....   So they became 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; car theft capital of the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I didn't know that.  I always thought the place was kinda shady ever since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I was told it had the largest number of churches per capita of any place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the country.  Coming from New Orleans (with the largest number per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capita of bars) was something of a ... shock.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;steve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Rome was also - at the instigation of some local libertarian activists, I 
<BR>
believe - the site of a major legal test bed for the use of restitution in 
<BR>
place of punishment, back in the late '70's, early '80's.  Any idea what 
<BR>
became of that?
<BR>
<P>BTW, is Peggy's still there?  Most famous whorehouse East of New Orleans.
<BR>
<P>The guy who started the &quot;Glory Road&quot; intentional family, modeled after 
<BR>
Heinlein's families depicted in &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress,&quot; also got 
<BR>
started in Rome.  At one point, Glory Road had about 50 members, with all 
<BR>
the adults married mutually to each other.  They also ran a number of 
<BR>
successful businesses out of Las Vegas, then moved to the Northwest Coast, 
<BR>
where the family seems to have largely split up, after a couple of decades 
<BR>
of apparent stability.  They had their own school for the kids.  Now they 
<BR>
call themselves &quot;Windward,&quot; and the old family members are still welcome, 
<BR>
but apparently they aren't willing or able to put up with the climate and 
<BR>
very rough living conditions of the new homestead.
<BR>
<P>What was the name of that big family entertainment center up North of 
<BR>
Armuchee?  With the big swimming pool, lake, horseback rides, etc.?
