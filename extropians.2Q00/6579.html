<BR>
<P>By LIDIA WASOWICZ, UPI Science Writer  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAN FRANCISCO, June 28 (UPI) -- The scientists who produced  
<BR>
the world's first clone of an adult mammal, a sheep named Dolly, have 
<BR>
created two lambs using a method they say holds promise for a wide array 
<BR>
of medical benefits. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers at PPL Therapeutics in Edinburgh, Scotland,  
<BR>
reported in the British journal Nature the successful carrying out of 
<BR>
gene targeting in Cupid and Diana, named after the mythological figures 
<BR>
with legendary accuracy in hitting their target -- the aim of the refined 
<BR>
technique. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two lambs were cloned from sheep DNA -- the chemical  
<BR>
inside the cell nucleus that carries the genetic instructions for making 
<BR>
living organisms -- altered to contain specific changes, a technique 
<BR>
commonly used in mice but not previously effective in other mammals. Now 
<BR>
that it has been shown to work in an animal other than the mouse, gene 
<BR>
targeting could offer a way to introduce made-to-order genetic 
<BR>
alterations into many species, the researchers said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Extension of gene targeting to other species could bring  
<BR>
considerable biological, medical and commercial benefits,&quot; lead study 
<BR>
author Alexander Kind told United Press International. 
<BR>
These could include: 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Production of animal models better suited than the mouse for  
<BR>
shedding physiological light on human genetic diseases and testing 
<BR>
treatments for them. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Development of animals genetically modified to provide donor  
<BR>
organs for human transplantation. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Creation of animals that produce vast amounts of therapeutic  
<BR>
proteins. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Generation of cattle that make &quot;human milk,&quot; which could be  
<BR>
better tolerated than cow's milk by human infants. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Inactivation of prion genes to allow the study of so-called  
<BR>
prion diseases. The infectious agent prion has been linked to a group of 
<BR>
disorders that include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and kuru in 
<BR>
humans, scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also 
<BR>
called mad cow disease, in cattle. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is an important breakthrough, which will undoubtedly  
<BR>
pave the way for the development and use of animal models of human 
<BR>
disease,&quot; Andrew Spicer, assistant professor in the Rowe Program in 
<BR>
Genetics in the Department of Biological Chemistry at the University of 
<BR>
California, Davis, School of Medicine, told UPI. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is clearly a landmark paper, which will presumably be  
<BR>
followed by additional researchers demonstrating the applicability of 
<BR>
this approach to other species, particularly herd animals.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We are clearly at the dawn of a new era in mammalian genetic  
<BR>
technology&quot;, said Milind Suraokar and Allan Bradley of the Howard Hughes 
<BR>
Medical Institute in Houston, Texas, who wrote an accompanying News and 
<BR>
Views article. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists cautioned about ethical considerations in applying  
<BR>
the technology to humans but stressed that such application would be 
<BR>
covered by the strict guidelines currently in place to regulate human 
<BR>
cloning. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gene targeting of mice has been common because the embryonic  
<BR>
stem cells -- the progenitor cells that give rise to all others -- in 
<BR>
mice are easy to change. Researchers can &quot;knock out&quot; -- or inactivate -- 
<BR>
individual mice genes to recreate many human disorders. Not so in other 
<BR>
mammals, including sheep; modifying their stem cells is not effective. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Kind and colleagues came up with a way to achieve gene  
<BR>
targeting in sheep without the need for stem cells. In the technique 
<BR>
called nuclear transfer -- a similar version of which was used to create 
<BR>
Dolly in 1996 -- researchers first insert a DNA sequence into a specific 
<BR>
chromosome region of an adult sheep cell. Then they fuse these modified 
<BR>
cells with sheep eggs from which the nucleus has been removed. Sheep 
<BR>
grown from these eggs incorporate the targeted genetic change. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is the key breakthrough.... that should make this  
<BR>
technology applicable to many species,&quot; Spicer said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our finding that stem cells are not necessary to achieve gene  
<BR>
targeting in animals is in my opinion the central point of our paper,&quot; 
<BR>
Kind said. &quot;The main block to progress in the area, the lack of embryonic 
<BR>
stem cells, has been removed, and I look forward to finding out how 
<BR>
generally applicable our methods prove to be.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gene targeting is a method of making precise, predetermined  
<BR>
modifications to an organism's genetic material. Scientists can add, 
<BR>
delete, replace or modify DNA sequences while leaving adjoining regions 
<BR>
unaltered -- an ability that has led to an explosion in the understanding 
<BR>
of gene function in mice, investigators said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method employed by Kind and team is quite similar to that  
<BR>
carried out in mice -- with one critical difference: no embryonic stem 
<BR>
cells are needed. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Despite considerable efforts, no one has been able to derive  
<BR>
fully functional embryonic stem cells from animals other than mice,&quot; Kind 
<BR>
said. &quot;Fully functional being defined as capable of contributing to all 
<BR>
cells of an animal, including the germ line (which would allow passage of 
<BR>
the trait to offspring). This has until now prevented the extension of 
<BR>
gene targeting to other species. Ours are the first gene targeted mammals 
<BR>
other than mice.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report comes on the heels of the announcement Monday that  
<BR>
two teams have decoded the genetic makeup of humans. Flanked by President 
<BR>
Clinton, with British Prime Minister Tony Blair appearing by video link, 
<BR>
Francis Collins, director of the Human Genome Project at the National 
<BR>
Institutes of Health, and J. Craig Venter, head of Celera Genomics, a 
<BR>
private company in Rockville, Md., reported the completion of a rough 
<BR>
draft of the human blueprint after 10 years of research. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is the most important, most wondrous map ever produced  
<BR>
by humankind,&quot; Clinton said at the White House news conference. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Elucidation of the genome sequence and the identification of  
<BR>
each gene is the first step towards understanding how we develop, and 
<BR>
what causes things to go wrong, ultimately leading to disease,&quot; Spicer 
<BR>
told UPI. &quot;The ability to investigate gene function in more than one 
<BR>
model species will allow us to more rapidly develop new strategies aimed 
<BR>
at disease prevention and treatment.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revolutionary technology of gene targeting, which has also  
<BR>
been used in plants, protozoans and microscopic worms, has spawned 
<BR>
visions of potential applications ranging from developing improved animal 
<BR>
models to study human disease and test potential therapies to providing 
<BR>
genetic treatment for those disorders. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One clear application of this technology is in the rapid  
<BR>
creation of specific herd animals in which a therapeutic protein is 
<BR>
expressed in the milk,&quot; Spicer said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Using this technology, it may be more feasible to engineer  
<BR>
animals in order to provide transplant organs that survive substantially 
<BR>
longer in the transplant patient. Organs could be engineered such that 
<BR>
the major surface proteins recognized by the human immune system are 
<BR>
human, expressed by human genes that have been 'knocked into' the given 
<BR>
animal gene,&quot; Spicer said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Another possible application of this technology is the  
<BR>
ultimate creation of cattle producing 'human milk.' By engineering the 
<BR>
cattle genes coding for the major milk proteins to modified versions that 
<BR>
express the human equivalents, it may be possible to create cattle that 
<BR>
produce milk that is much better tolerated by human infants. Formulas 
<BR>
more closely resembling human milk for instance.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improved animal models for human diseases could have a  
<BR>
significant impact, Spicer said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Currently, the mouse represents the organism of choice for  
<BR>
modeling human genetic disease,&quot; he said. &quot;This is primarily due to the 
<BR>
relative ease at which gene knockouts can be achieved in the mouse. For 
<BR>
many diseases, the mouse is not the ideal model, due to differences in 
<BR>
physiology, lifespan, etc. Ultimately, this breakthrough will provide 
<BR>
researchers with the ability to choose the model organism that may be the 
<BR>
most appropriate for the study of a particular disease.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past decade, advances in developing mice with  
<BR>
alterations to specific endogenous genes by gene targeting in embryonic 
<BR>
stem cells have been so rapid, scientists can now generate large numbers 
<BR>
of rodents with various gene deficiencies. These knockout mice provide 
<BR>
models for studying the function of individual mammalian genes and a 
<BR>
range of human inherited disorders, scientists said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, scientists found a defective homeotic, or Hox,  
<BR>
gene in mice creates effects similar to those seen in humans with Di 
<BR>
George syndrome. The mice with the mutated gene die at birth from 
<BR>
cardiovascular dysfunction caused by malformed heart vessels and muscle. 
<BR>
Di George syndrome is not brought about by a bad Hox gene in humans but 
<BR>
is thought to be caused by a gene that interferes with the HOX protein. 
<BR>
The mouse model can help scientists develop clues to treatment, 
<BR>
investigators said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realizing the metabolic differences between man and mouse,  
<BR>
researchers have been working to design more sophisticated gene-targeting 
<BR>
methods to introduce subtle gene alterations. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology has already benefited immunologists studying  
<BR>
the development of immune cells called lymphocytes and cancer researchers 
<BR>
analyzing the role of genes, such as the p53 suppresser gene, in tumors. 
<BR>
More than 80 percent of human cancers have been found to have a mutated 
<BR>
p53 gene. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists also expect gene targeting to have an impact on  
<BR>
neurobiology, providing a novel approach to cracking the molecular codes 
<BR>
that underlie learning, memory and other functions of the nervous system. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, some major challenges must be met, such as learning  
<BR>
which cell types are optimal for use in gene targeting. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the mouse, gene targeting efficiencies are often  
<BR>
dramatically influenced by the use of 'isogenic' (from the same genetic 
<BR>
background as the embryonic stem cells being targeted) DNA in the 
<BR>
construction of targeting vectors,&quot; Spicer said. &quot;If this is not as 
<BR>
important in other species, such as sheep, this would simplify the 
<BR>
approach.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their experiment, the researchers carefully chose the  
<BR>
target site for placing in Cupid a marker gene called neo and in Diana 
<BR>
the same marker plus a gene designed to produce a therapeutic protein 
<BR>
called alpha 1antitrypsin in her milk. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Targeting events were carried out to place genes adjacent to  
<BR>
a collagen gene,&quot; Kind said. &quot;The significance of choosing this site was 
<BR>
to test whether it would support high expression of the transgene. Our 
<BR>
findings were that it did very well and may therefore provide a good 
<BR>
position for placement of other transgenes, rather than the 'lucky dip' 
<BR>
of random integration.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPL scientists have their current sights set on producing pigs  
<BR>
for xenotransplantation. In a first step toward that goal, researchers at 
<BR>
a PPL subsidiary in Blacksburg, Va., have produced the first cloned pigs. 
<BR>
The five little products of nuclear transfer -- named Millie, Christa, 
<BR>
Alexis, Carrel and Dotcom -- were delivered by Caesarean section March 5 
<BR>
at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth was pronounced &quot;a very significant accomplishment&quot;  
<BR>
by PPL vice president of research Dave Ayares, who told a news 
<BR>
conference, &quot;It has the potential to essentially revolutionize the 
<BR>
transplantation field.&quot;
