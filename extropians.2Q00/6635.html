<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Remember the basic principles of the welfare state: people are too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stupid,  weak and evil to decide for themselves. It is better if a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technocratic elite  does it in their place. Really, if something is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an opposition to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumanism it is the welfare and the attitudes it spread in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree. While that may be the case in regards to Extropianism, I
<BR>
see nothing in transhumanism in general that is at odds with the
<BR>
concepts of central planning, wealth redistribution, and the Welfare
<BR>
State as we know it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the welfare state 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you don't have the economic resources to be innovative, people in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the  welfare states are poor- the government is rich.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've always been interested in the perceived dichotomy among
<BR>
libertarians between the government and the people. Surely the people
<BR>
are the ones who make up the government? And I take issue with the
<BR>
notion that all innovation comes from individuals; groups (whether
<BR>
they be private associations, corporations, or the government) are
<BR>
just as capable of technological and social innovation as
<BR>
individuals. Moreso; because they have the ability to concentrate
<BR>
resources in a rational manner to achieve a specific goal. If you
<BR>
want to get from point A to point B, better one sled team moving as a
<BR>
unit than a pack of wild dogs roaming willy-nilly. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You'll be just as innovative as other people tell you to be (its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not for you  to decide, you don't have the means). But being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; innovative isn't really all  transhumanism is about. A nazi can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;play a bit with computers&quot;. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Transhumanism is a much greater stream of ideas that touch all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aspects of  life. Transhumanism has to interest itself in politics.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree completely. Transhumanism in general, and transhumanist
<BR>
sub-groups in particular, must interest itself in politics. We should
<BR>
be working to ensure that it is we who have our hands on the levers
<BR>
of political power, if only to prevent the ignorant and the greedy
<BR>
from interfering with our achieving our transformative goals.
