<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There is not even any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; real debate about what such a process would do: everyone knows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exactly what the result of such a copying process would likely do,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; how each thing would likely feel and behave; there simply aren't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any interesting facts in controversy here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hell, yes, there are.  If I'm facing a choice whether to be copied, should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I expect this self-awareness to continue in the original?  Or continue in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either the original or the copy, with a 50% probability of each?  If I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; facing a choice whether to step into the (Star Trek) transporter, then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first possibility above would mean that my self-awareness would cease 100%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the time, and the second possibility would mean that my self-awareness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would cease 50% of the time.  Neither of which sound very appealing to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The end of my self-awareness, my sense of ego, is what I call &quot;death&quot;, nor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is this merely a semantic matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think anyone in this debate is seriously arguing non-materialism;
<BR>
it has been long conceded that if one reproduces atom-for-atom the mass of
<BR>
flesh that is me, each reproduction will behave and feel exactly as I do
<BR>
now--there is nothing &quot;magical&quot; about me that isn't contained wholly
<BR>
within my arrangement of atoms (and perhaps their quantum states, which
<BR>
are also theoretically reproducible).
<BR>
<P>The conept of &quot;original&quot; in this scenario is only of interest to legal
<BR>
and moral (and possibly religious) arguments.  No one really doubts what
<BR>
the two lumps would feel like and behave like.  If you want to seriously
<BR>
argue non-materialism, you should probably go find a religious list
<BR>
somewhere.
