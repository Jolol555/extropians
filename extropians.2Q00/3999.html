<BR>
<EM>&gt; Rand's lack of appreciation for art and the arts outside her own personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opinion (however, she called it objective) was more due to her inability
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; understand and appreciate knowledge outside her own sphere.  Her rigidity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and lack of experience in Contemporary Art
</EM><BR>
<P>What &quot;lack of experience&quot;?  Granted, I don't think she went to every new
<BR>
installation at MOMA during her life, but she was not totally out of touch,
<BR>
especially given her comments in _The Romantic Manifesto_ and elsewhere.  I
<BR>
see her as an omnivorous consumer of culture for her time.  Surely, she was
<BR>
not familiar with every nook and cranny of the art of her time (she lived
<BR>
from 1905 to 1982), but she was not a totally ignorant.  (If one holds up
<BR>
total familiarity as the standard, then one might as well disqualify
<BR>
everyone from the discussion.  I don't think Natasha explicitly holds this
<BR>
standard, though her and others' comments seem to hint at it.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; seems to be reflective of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rigidity in her psychology and her need for control.  This behavior runs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contrary to the open mindedness and curious attitude which can be aroused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by fluidity and uncertainty.  Such reactions as feelings of  fluidity and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uncertainty stem are emotions experienced form contemporary art and which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; art modes.  Rand did not have the intellectual flexibility to understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such freeness of intelligent thinking, and such she disregarded as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unimportant.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree she definitely had some bad personality traits and some of this, no
<BR>
doubt, reflects in her casual dismissals as well as vicious attacks on
<BR>
certain art works and artists.  Even so, a lot of highly creative people and
<BR>
supposedly open minded people are often very rigid and even dogmatic in
<BR>
thier personal life.  Some of this leaks over into their intellectual life.
<BR>
Look at, e.g., the case of Karl Popper.  At least, according to W. W.
<BR>
Bartley in _Unfathomed Knowledge, Unmeasured Wealth_, he was a &quot;difficult
<BR>
man.&quot;  This does not excuse Rand, but it does point out that merely
<BR>
dismissing her views because she often was a domineering bitch is not a
<BR>
strong argument.  Psychologizing -- attributing motives to someone -- is
<BR>
usually only useful after one has refuted her or his theories.  One should
<BR>
never do it beforehand, else one runs the risk of not examining the ideas
<BR>
too closely especially when one finds them disagreeable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Although an &quot;intellectual&quot;, she lacked a necessary ingredient of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual thinker -- ability to develop knowledge and understanding
</EM><BR>
from
<BR>
<EM>&gt; areas of thought outside one's one sphere of expertise.
</EM><BR>
<P>LOL!  What was her sphere of expertise?  What areas did she fail to develop
<BR>
or understand?  This charge is interesting since it can be attributed to
<BR>
anyone.  All of us, I bet, make claims that are outside our province and
<BR>
that demonstrate our ignorance.  Even so, one needs more than just point to
<BR>
a truism to prove a given assertion by a given thinker wrong.
<BR>
<P>Also, _What Art Is_, insofar as I've skimmed it, appears to be an attempt to
<BR>
critically refine Rand's esthetics -- often correcting Rand by rejecting her
<BR>
views.  (I have read the essay on which the book is based and have been in
<BR>
contact with the authors over the years, so I'm not just getting this from a
<BR>
casual scanning.)  I bring this up because one should try to see what is of
<BR>
value in Rand's esthetics.  I don't think they are totally worthless.  (I'm
<BR>
not sure if Natasha thinks they are, but I'd like to hear her comments on
<BR>
what she thinks is salvageable from Rand's esthetics per se.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Narrow, limited, uninformed.  This is as ridiculous as claiming that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; today's purported science is really not science at all.  The subjective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aspect of art is whatever the artists chooses his art to be.  the
</EM><BR>
objective
<BR>
<EM>&gt; aspect of art is represented in the outcome of the artist's ideas -- the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; product.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is an argument from authority.  I.e., there is no such thing as art but
<BR>
for what an artist tells us is art.  Imagine if a chef fried up some plaster
<BR>
and called it edible.  Would we have to agree with  him?  What if a
<BR>
physicist told us that since she wrote a fantasy novel that the novel was,
<BR>
in fact, science?
<BR>
<P>The notion that art somehow is outside the province of identity is what Rand
<BR>
objected too.  She dos not stand alone in this.  Nor are Objectivists the
<BR>
only ones to agree with her on this point.  Thinkers from philosophically
<BR>
divergent backgrounds, such as Jacques Barzun, also agree.  (I'm not
<BR>
dropping names here as an argument from authority.  Instead, I'm just trying
<BR>
to show that Rand and Objectivists are not the only ones drawing this
<BR>
conclusion.)
<BR>
<P>I expect Natasha here to contend that art _is_ outside identity or invents
<BR>
its identity...:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I find that art today is so fascinating -- so beyond anything ever thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of years ago -- it's just different.  This evening, I was watching a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program on TV with Ray Kurzweil and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, and four
</EM><BR>
other
<BR>
<EM>&gt; creative thinkers on the subject of &quot;Creativity.&quot;  I loved it.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consensus was that there are no boundaries on creativity and that a most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary element of creativity is to allow oneself to explore an open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; range of possibilities, to make mistakes, to rearrange ideas, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>I generally agree, BUT one must also admit that creativity does not always
<BR>
guarantee success.  In this context, not everytime a painter puts paint to
<BR>
canvas or whatever results in art.  (I know this from experience.  I would
<BR>
claim all of my paintings can be safely ignored if not actively
<BR>
disregarded.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only worthwhile art, as Rand preferred, was the Romantic period and
</EM><BR>
artists
<BR>
<EM>&gt; kept making the same plays, fiction, music paintings and sculpture with
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; same ol' tools,  there would never have been challenge to artististic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creativity.  How contrary to her own values!
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree here.  I've said so elsewhere, though my views differ from
<BR>
Natasha's.  See &quot;Romanticism -- Beyond Rand&quot; (at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.freeradical.co.nz/content/34/34ust.html">http://www.freeradical.co.nz/content/34/34ust.html</A>), where I attack Rand's
<BR>
narrow idea of Romanticism in art, and &quot;Response to David C. Adams on Rand's
<BR>
View of Romanticism&quot; (at <A HREF="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Adams.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Adams.html</A>),
<BR>
where I rebutt a rejoinder by David Adams to the previous piece, and &quot;Form
<BR>
and Content in Poetry: A Reply to Jackie van Oostrom&quot; (at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Poetry.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Poetry.html</A>) where I attack some narrow
<BR>
Objectivist views of poetry.  (To be honest, Rand said little about poetry,
<BR>
which is surprising given the number of Romantic poets.)
<BR>
<P>Objectivists and the like need to be a bit less sheepish toward Rand and
<BR>
willing to think and create outside the box.  Still, this does not give them
<BR>
a blank check.  Creativity itself, again, is not guarantee one will get it
<BR>
right.  If it was, then there would be no need for knowledge and learning or
<BR>
skill.  And when a given creative endeavor fails, one must be willing to
<BR>
admit that and move on -- rather than sing hymns to it or condemn those who
<BR>
point out such failure.
<BR>
<P>Also, another point should be mentioned.  Since human nature places limits
<BR>
on what humans can perceive, art is limited by this.  Even posthumans will
<BR>
have a nature and this will be limited too.  (To be is to be limited =
<BR>
existence is identity.)  This does not mean one can's skate close to the
<BR>
edge.  In fact, I encourage it, but, again, if the ice breaks...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oh my.  This paragraph is painful to read.  Pollock (painter), Cage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (musician), Cunningham (dancer/choreographer) were brilliant artists whose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *innovative* abilities shook the very foundation of the old-world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stifling-stamp on what society thought art was supposed to be. Their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; visionary approach to creativity helped society to break free of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual and emotional constraints.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think but for Pollock, Cage, and Cunningham, we'd be stuck in the
<BR>
last century or with strictly European culture.  I don't see Pollock or Cage
<BR>
as liberating in an artistic sense.  Anybody can proclaim anything goes.
<BR>
This does not make him or her an artist.  Granted, all of these people knew
<BR>
how to create art -- I mean in the tradition sense -- but look what came
<BR>
after.  I.e., too many so called artists today have thrown out the baby with
<BR>
bathwater -- or even kept the bathwater after throwing out the baby.  In
<BR>
painting, I see too many lauded works which are really flat -- having no
<BR>
depth beyond merely being shocking for the moment and the latest fad.
<BR>
<P>Now we have to go find the baby and hope it didn't die of exposure.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
