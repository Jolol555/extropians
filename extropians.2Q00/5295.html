<EM>&gt; In a world where everyone is a trillionaire, the guy with ten trillion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still gets the girl, the better spaceship, the asteroid in the better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neighborhood, more friends, and more opportunities.  The very concept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of &quot;enough&quot; is ridiculous, with no place in Extropian thought.  It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at odds with conservation of mass-energy and the desire to expand.
</EM><BR>
<P>If intelligence remains voluntary, then those who choose to stay human
<BR>
will never run out of ways to make themselves miserable.  The
<BR>
_Diaspora_-class uploads will compete for social status, snub each
<BR>
other, and punish nonconformism; all the tension and fear that humans
<BR>
now invest in money will simply be redirected, rather than destroyed. 
<BR>
The Amish will keep farming.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps there's some incredibly clever solution to even that problem,
<BR>
one that doesn't involve coercion.  Or perhaps the morality of
<BR>
superintelligence is determined and will not allow for even voluntary
<BR>
suffering, regardless of the programmer's suggestions.
<BR>
<P>I can still hope for a world in which good wins *completely* and
<BR>
forever, by strictly ethical means, because there might well be some
<BR>
blatantly obvious way to do it.  That's the miracle of intelligence.  I
<BR>
can hope for a world that is totally without suffering, even the
<BR>
suffering of existential ennui or boredom, because that is the Standard
<BR>
Sentient Quest and there will be immense intelligence turned to making
<BR>
it so.
<BR>
<P>Still, I would regard the _Diaspora_ scenario - in which pain, death,
<BR>
coercion, and stupidity still exist, but are voluntary - as a &quot;win&quot;.
<BR>
<P>It's tempting to say that voluntary suffering would no longer be my
<BR>
concern, but suffering is suffering.  Even as a posthuman, I'd probably
<BR>
still care about the Amish.  It's nice to think that theists must
<BR>
necessarily have made a conscious choice to turn their back on
<BR>
rationality and therefore deserve what they get, but that's just not the
<BR>
way the world works.  If you're raised with a particular set of beliefs,
<BR>
it requires a mental action to modify them, not the other way around.  
<BR>
<P>But the set of interventions permitted by the Sysop would be limited,
<BR>
and could probably be implemented automatically, without conscious
<BR>
attention on my part.  Certainly, the interventions could be implemented
<BR>
without expenditure of mental energy on my part - &quot;mental energy&quot; is a
<BR>
concept that posthumans can do without.
<BR>
<P>At the end of my road lies a world in which suffering has either been
<BR>
eliminated or decreased to the irreducible minimum, and in which those
<BR>
who choose are completely free from suffering - free even from guilt
<BR>
over the continued existence of that irreducible minimum.
