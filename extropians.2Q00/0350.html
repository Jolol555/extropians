<P>
My two cents:
<BR>
<P>1.  I think we OUGHT to be able to have a rational discussion of &quot;weapons 
<BR>
technology&quot; without the topic igniting a hypertrophied flame-fest.  All 
<BR>
long-time subscribers know that the core question of the right to keep and 
<BR>
bear arms is one of the most divisive this list encounters.  Accordingly, I 
<BR>
ask folks to please try to stay on topic and to exercise discretion and 
<BR>
judgment about volume and tone when a discussion touching on weapons 
<BR>
technology comes up.  PLEASE.  (If you won't do it out of a concern for the 
<BR>
general health of the list, consider it a personal favor to me - you never 
<BR>
know when you might need a good lawyer.)
<BR>
<P>2.  Folks who know me personally know that I am a heavily armed sport shooter 
<BR>
and weapons collector, so my opinions and views should not be suspect by 
<BR>
folks supporting the right of individuals to keep and bear arms.
<BR>
<P>3.  With that preamble, my THEORETICAL views on &quot;smart guns&quot;:  Extropians are 
<BR>
characterized by an open mind to technological improvements to human 
<BR>
activities.  A weapon is an item of technology.  As such it can be improved.  
<BR>
Extropians are also characterized by a desire to increase the regime of 
<BR>
individual liberty and the realm in which individuals can exercise their 
<BR>
judgment and power without unduly infringing on the rights of other 
<BR>
individuals to do the same.  With that in mind, I look at my guns as MY guns. 
<BR>
&nbsp;I want to be able to control who has access to them and who can use them.  I 
<BR>
want to be able to use them when I want to, in a way that doesn't unjustly 
<BR>
hurt another person.  I also want to be able to allow others of my free 
<BR>
choosing to use them under the same circumstances, and to deny their 
<BR>
possession and use to others when to do so suits my goals.  If a 
<BR>
technological innovation implements these goals well, I'M ALL FOR IT.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another    
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;
