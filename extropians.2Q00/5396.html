I notice that this debate has been framed in a way that concentrates on 
<BR>
whether or not windows is a good OS, and whether or not free-market 
<BR>
economics is the best system for introducing the best products to the 
<BR>
greatest number of people, for the best price.
<BR>
Let's assume for the sake of argument that it is not, that MS makes terrible 
<BR>
products, that progress is not occurring because of their products being on 
<BR>
the market, and that if some central agency were to be set up to determine 
<BR>
which products are allowed to be sold, then we'd all live in luxory and 
<BR>
would not have to work. I would still prefer a free market.
<BR>
Suppose I started selling dirt, at the price of 30$/ounce. I set up an 
<BR>
internet business, dirtforsale.com, and take credit cards, and ship dirt to 
<BR>
whoever wants it. I'd assume that nobody thinks that I should not be allowed 
<BR>
to do this. Obviously, it's a stupid idea, but there's no reason I should 
<BR>
not be allowed to do it. But then assume that people start to buy it. I do 
<BR>
an IPO, I become a billionaire, and people spend maybe 5% of their incomes 
<BR>
on my dirt. They're using it to decorate the floors of their homes suppose. 
<BR>
I make deals with construction companies telling them that if they want to 
<BR>
put Haradon Dirt in any of the homes they construct, they have to put it in 
<BR>
every single one. I imagine that at this point, there would be a suit 
<BR>
against me by carpet manufactureurs for anti-competitive practices, and 
<BR>
accusations that my dirt is unfairly priced, which would also be the basis 
<BR>
of many suits.
<BR>
So at what point would my freedom to produce and sell a product be a 
<BR>
secondary consideration to the effect on society that it has?
