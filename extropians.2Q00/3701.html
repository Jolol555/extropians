Forget where I saw this SF plot idea: Some people are discovered not to be
<BR>
self-aware.  Of course, they act just like normal people, but in reality are
<BR>
just &quot;zombies&quot;.  Although this is not a new idea (especially to Extropians),
<BR>
it is very interesting, and scary.  Exactly what is self-awareness anyway?
<BR>
How close are we to the border between automatons and higher beings?
<BR>
Perhaps we all slip into and out of self-awareness, but the self-awareness
<BR>
itself bridges the gaps to maintain the illusion of continuity.
<BR>
<P>Self-awareness may just be a specialized/larger version of other-awareness
<BR>
(our mental models of others).  We know some of what we're thinking, but
<BR>
have no direct way of knowing what others are thinking.  So our self-models
<BR>
are probably much more detailed and complex than our models of others.  Even
<BR>
so, our models of ourselves are (necessarily?) very scaled down versions of
<BR>
what we actually are.  This brings to mind the iceberg of consciousness
<BR>
(i.e. perhaps more than 90% of our thought processes are subconscious).  Are
<BR>
our subconscious selves automatons by definition (no self-awareness)?
<BR>
<P>Perhaps this is why modifying our own behaviors and attitudes is often so
<BR>
difficult: our self-models are too incomplete, and/or our self-awareness is
<BR>
too time-disjointed, to allow us to be very effective at altering ourselves.
<BR>
Perhaps in essense we are mostly automatons, with just a glimmering of
<BR>
self-awareness.  Almost like piloting a very heavy vehicle, with tremendous
<BR>
momentum, caught up in the complex causality maelstrom of societal
<BR>
interactions: we usually can make minor course corrections, and sometimes we
<BR>
find the wherewithal to make significant/rapid changes.  But usually we're
<BR>
just along for the ride ...
<BR>
<P>I suspect there may be evolutionary merit for our genes to program us into
<BR>
thinking we have more control than we really do.  You may immediately
<BR>
respond that thinking otherwise is counterproductive or foolish.  But maybe
<BR>
that's just your genes defending themselves by bolstering the illusion :)
<BR>
<P>I continue to marvel at Greg Egan's masterful novel, _Diaspora_:
<BR>
- 6-dimensional universe, vividly described!
<BR>
- The Introdus (uploading) and its profound implications.
<BR>
<P>Delurking,
<BR>
