<BR>
I love a good Freudian slip, whether its my own (embarrassing, sometimes) or
<BR>
someone else's (so that's what he/she really meant).  I't like falling on a
<BR>
banana peel.  (I wonder if &quot;fslex&quot; was a slip in the URL:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.fgi.net/~freud/fslex.htm">http://www.fgi.net/~freud/fslex.htm</A> -:))   Mostly, my own lapsus linguae or
<BR>
lapsus calami are casued by faulty brain connections.  Here's a piece I was
<BR>
amused by:
<BR>
<P><P>Freud Slips as an Icon of Science  (by Usha Lee McFarling)
<BR>
<P>Once the dominant figure in efforts to understand the mind, the father of
<BR>
psychoanalysis has been proved wrong in nearly all of his notions.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
No scientific figure has permeated the American consciousness--and perhaps
<BR>
its unconscious--more than Sigmund Freud.  From Freudian slips to defense
<BR>
mechanisms to the cigars he made more notorious than Monica Lewinsky ever
<BR>
could, Freud's ideas are everywhere.  They've shaped the way we see the
<BR>
mind, altered the way we interpret literature and brought talk therapy to
<BR>
the world at large. They've also leaked far outside academic circles,
<BR>
infiltrating the work of Alfred Hitchcock and Woody Allen and even &quot;The
<BR>
Simpsons.&quot;
<BR>
<P>But there's a slight problem. Unlike Einstein and Darwin, whose
<BR>
groundbreaking ideas have survived for decades, the emerging consensus among
<BR>
scientists, including psychiatrists, about Freud is that he was wrong. About
<BR>
almost everything.
<BR>
<P>Penis envy hasn't fared well. Ditto for castration anxiety, latent
<BR>
homosexuality and Oedipal complexes as deep motivating factors in behavior.
<BR>
<P>The list goes on: Freud's understanding of women's sexuality has been
<BR>
eviscerated by feminists. And the notion that dreams are a &quot;royal road&quot; to
<BR>
the unconscious has been largely put to rest by research on rapid eye
<BR>
movement, or REM, sleep.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The scientific literature is clear,&quot; said Frank Sulloway, author of &quot;Freud:
<BR>
Biologist of the Mind&quot; and visiting professor in the department of
<BR>
psychology at UC Berkeley. &quot;Freud was wrong in almost every important
<BR>
respect.&quot;
<BR>
Although many psychoanalysts argue that updated versions of Freud's thinking
<BR>
are still relevant to understanding--and aiding--the human mind today,
<BR>
Freud's legacy has largely migrated from the scientific realm to the
<BR>
cultural. Today his texts are more likely to be read in English departments
<BR>
than in medical schools.
<BR>
<P>Michael Roth, curator of an exhibit on Freud now at the Skirball Cultural
<BR>
Center in the Sepulveda Pass (LA), thinks Freud's allure may stem simply
<BR>
from the topics he chose to address.
<BR>
<P>There's sex. Aggression. Sex. Childhood fantasies. Sex. Traumatic events.
<BR>
Sex. Inner needs. Sex. Dreams. Oh, and sex.
<BR>
<P>All the anxiety and conflict over Freud seem to have manifested themselves
<BR>
in a battle between Freudians and doubters that long delayed the opening of
<BR>
the exhibit. It was an Oedipal clash of egos and superegos; and id ain't
<BR>
over yet.
<BR>
<P>The exhibit--which runs through July 25--focuses largely on Freud's cultural
<BR>
influence and says almost nothing about science.
<BR>
<P>It's not likely that Freud would have been flattered by his very American
<BR>
incorporation into the cultural mainstream. The good Viennese doctor pops up
<BR>
in &quot;The Flintstones,&quot; &quot;Popeye,&quot; even &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.&quot;
<BR>
In one &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode, Homer suggests that Marge should repress her
<BR>
anxieties, &quot;so she'll never annoy us again.&quot;
<BR>
But &quot;Freud started in science. He was 100% identified in science. That's
<BR>
what he cared about,&quot; Sulloway said. &quot;If all [that proponents] can salvage
<BR>
is his cultural influence, it's actually pretty tragic.&quot;
<BR>
<P>It's not only Freud's theories that have taken a hit. The man himself has
<BR>
been battered by a slew of critics--so many that they are referred to as a
<BR>
&quot;Freud industry.&quot; They have unearthed verrrry interesting evidence
<BR>
suggesting that Freud had an affair with his sister-in-law, arranged amorous
<BR>
affairs for one of his patients, abused cocaine, denied a patient's valid
<BR>
claim of childhood sexual abuse, and napped and wrote correspondence during
<BR>
therapeutic sessions with patients.
<BR>
<P>Freud's proudest legacy--psychoanalysis--hasn't done much better.
<BR>
Psychoanalysis, which can be a years-long, four-day-a-week process that
<BR>
seeks to unveil how dreams, the past and a person's unconscious thoughts
<BR>
shape current behavior, is under siege. It's been largely replaced by
<BR>
antidepressants and shorter, less costly forms of treatment such as
<BR>
short-term psychotherapy.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Psychoanalysis,&quot; said Edward Shorter, a University of Toronto historian of
<BR>
medicine, is &quot;a dinosaur ideology of the 19th century staggering toward the
<BR>
tar pit.&quot; Yet like much else in the tangled story of Freud legend,
<BR>
psychoanalysis remains an area of vicious debate.
<BR>
<P>Proponents, including many patients, say it can offer great and lasting
<BR>
help. Critics such as Shorter say the field has been responsible for the
<BR>
suicides of many severely mentally ill patients who required medication and
<BR>
hospitalization more than sessions on the couch.
<BR>
<P>Freud Still Stirs Passions
<BR>
So if Freud was so wrong, if his methods remain dubious and if he was a poor
<BR>
and possibly unethical practitioner, we are left with a most Freudian
<BR>
question: Why is he so irrepressible?  Despite his having been proclaimed
<BR>
dead dozens of times since his actual death in 1939, Freud continues to
<BR>
inflame, inspire and provoke intellectual schisms that border on open
<BR>
warfare.  Consider the history of the current exhibit at the Skirball.
<BR>
<P>Conceived by the Library of Congress in 1993, &quot;Freud: Conflict and Culture&quot;
<BR>
was nearly stopped in its tracks, and its Washington, D.C., debut was
<BR>
delayed five years. Its foremost enemy was Freud critic Peter Swales, who
<BR>
circulated a petition of protest.
<BR>
<P>Swales, a onetime Rolling Stones concert promoter who started a second
<BR>
career by unearthing unsavory details of Freud's personal life, complained
<BR>
that the exhibit would be a &quot;Freudfest&quot;--a chance for the doctor's thinning
<BR>
ranks of psychoanalytical disciples to dust off his fading legacy.
<BR>
<P>At the time, another Freud critic, Frederick Crews, a retired UC Berkeley
<BR>
professor of English, said the motive behind the exhibit &quot;was to polish up
<BR>
the tarnished image of a business that's heading into Chapter 11.&quot;
<BR>
The psychoanalytic community, led by the Long Island psychoanalyst who is
<BR>
director of the Freud archives, Dr. Harold Blum, responded with a
<BR>
classically Freudian argument: Critics were unconsciously resisting the
<BR>
truth because Freud's ideas were too threatening.
<BR>
<P>In analyzing the critics, the Freudians did have plenty of ammunition.
<BR>
Swales once longed to be director of the Freud archives. And, like a vocal
<BR>
ex-smoker, Crews spent years in training to become a psychoanalyst before
<BR>
vehemently renouncing the field.
<BR>
<P>Even nuanced personal details became cannon fodder. Roth, the exhibit's
<BR>
curator, was suspect simply because the father of his ex-wife is a noted
<BR>
Freud critic.
<BR>
&quot;The level of nastiness, even for academia, is pretty extreme, &quot; said Roth,
<BR>
assistant director of the Getty Research Institute.
<BR>
<P>'Even Critics Psychoanalyze Freud'
<BR>
<P>To his proponents, Freud's ideas--a way to look at inner desires and hidden
<BR>
motivation--are so important and commonplace that they are taken for
<BR>
granted.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Even the critics psychoanalyze Freud, which is an ironic homage,&quot; said
<BR>
James Hansell, a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst on the faculty of
<BR>
the University of Michigan and the Michigan Psychoanalytic Institute.
<BR>
Many psychoanalysts argue that, although many of Freud's theories have
<BR>
foundered, no one else has come close to providing answers about human
<BR>
nature that are as satisfying.
<BR>
<P>The steady stream of scientific findings emerging from the labs of
<BR>
neuroscientists--from imaging machines flickering with pictures of the brain
<BR>
at work to the understanding of subtle chemicals that whisper messages
<BR>
across neurons--has done little to provide a full understanding of human
<BR>
nature.
<BR>
<P>Some of those findings are disturbing, particularly the idea that our inner
<BR>
selves can be boiled down to a chemical recipe that can be tweaked and
<BR>
improved with pinches of lithium salts and dashes of serotonin blockers.
<BR>
Today's reductionist, biological, Prozac-laden approach to the mind offers
<BR>
limited understanding, Hansell said.
<BR>
&quot;The violence, the political scandal we see--all those things seem to cry
<BR>
out for a deeper explanation,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't seem to have the tools to
<BR>
deal with it without in-depth psychology, including psychoanalysis.&quot;
<BR>
For Roth, Freud's answers may be suspect, but the questions he asked--about
<BR>
what we do and why we do it--continue to fascinate.
<BR>
<P>Nevertheless, even Freud's broad cultural reach may be shrinking. In World
<BR>
War II-era films such as Hitchcock's &quot;Spellbound,&quot; psychoanalysts were often
<BR>
portrayed as imposing, scholarly figures. Since then, portrayals of analysts
<BR>
in film and television have become more comic, and sometimes mocking.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;Frasier&quot;-filled '90s &quot;might represent the era of the cinema's greatest
<BR>
ridicule of the therapist,&quot; said Ann E. Kaplan, an English professor at the
<BR>
State University of New York at Stonybrook and expert on psychoanalysis and
<BR>
film, in an essay that accompanies the Skirball exhibit.
<BR>
<P>Even the New Yorker, long the home of cartoons with a psychoanalytic bent,
<BR>
has depicted a practitioner holding this humbling sign: &quot;Will Psychoanalyze
<BR>
for Food.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Freudian references that do emerge today must compete with rival
<BR>
psychopharmacological visions. Take two Oscar-nominated motion pictures from
<BR>
1997.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; is a classic neo-Freudian tale, in which Matt Damon's
<BR>
character works with analyst Robin Williams, sees his life in a new way and,
<BR>
said Roth, &quot;gets a pretty girlfriend.&quot;
<BR>
<P>In &quot;As Good as It Gets,&quot; though, Jack Nicholson's obsessive-compulsive
<BR>
character is decidedly post-Freudian as he turns to pharmaceutical help.
<BR>
Roth said the message is: &quot;Take your medicine and you get a pretty
<BR>
girlfriend.&quot;
<BR>
Which vision will rule the future? Roth's 13-year-old son may be as good a
<BR>
harbinger as any. He's never made a Freudian joke, reported his father. Yet
<BR>
he frequently spouts lines like: &quot;Did you forget your medication today?&quot;
<BR>
Perhaps more ominous to keepers of the Freudian flame is that so much of the
<BR>
controversy that surrounded Freud and the exhibit in the early '90s has
<BR>
ebbed in the last couple of years. As the exhibit traveled from Washington
<BR>
to New York, Vienna and Los Angeles, it inspired little of the furor that
<BR>
Freudians have long claimed as proof of Freud's continued importance.
<BR>
<P>His biographer, Sulloway, has moved on to his own work extending Darwin's
<BR>
ideas to examine how personalities form.
<BR>
<P>After giving a few lectures on Freud to celebrate the opening of the exhibit
<BR>
here, Roth has returned to his main focus, examining how society interprets
<BR>
the past. He will soon become head of the Bay Area's California College of
<BR>
Arts and Crafts. 
<BR>
<P>Even longtime Freud critic Crews has unlaced his boxing gloves. When
<BR>
contacted for this article, he said: &quot;I don't want to talk about Freud. It's
<BR>
just so fruitless at this point.&quot;
