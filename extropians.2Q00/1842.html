<P>
This idea has been bounced around in a number of ways, but I see its
<BR>
implementation as being cost efficient and fairly easy.
<BR>
<P>Many would agree with me that the current system of government in the U.S.
<BR>
and Canada is nothing more than an electoral socialism --any eligible
<BR>
citizen can vote for a party, but has no real say in any important
<BR>
decisions that party and its legislature arrives upon.  Given the obvious
<BR>
ubiquity of the internet, and all the different facets of secure
<BR>
telecommunications, could there not be a democracy in the original sense:
<BR>
power by the people?
<BR>
<P>I envision a method where the electoral process is basically the same, but
<BR>
some aspects of legislation are opened up to the general populous of the
<BR>
country.  For example, when a bill is initially presented to the
<BR>
legislature, that bill could be placed on an internet site for all citizens
<BR>
of the country to vote on.  Each citizen could have a specific number code
<BR>
(such as S.I.N. number) they would have to enter to ensure that each
<BR>
citizen only gets one vote per bill.  Results would be tabulated within a
<BR>
certain time period (probably 24 hours) and the bill would be passed or
<BR>
scrapped on the basis of this true &quot;power by the people.&quot;
<BR>
<P>There are a few arguments I can foresee with this potential &quot;Networked
<BR>
Democracy&quot; --for one, there is the accessability issue.  Most leftists will
<BR>
argue that the poor will not get equal voting rights due to their lack of
<BR>
computers.  Though this is somewhat true, the availability of public
<BR>
internet connections is advancing rapidly, and the accessability issue is
<BR>
only temporary, to be sure.
<BR>
<P>The other, and perhaps more valid argument is whether or not &quot;power by the
<BR>
people&quot; is even worth pursuing.  The public has a reputation of being
<BR>
blissfully uninformed, prefering realistic fiction to cold hard fact.  The
<BR>
people in the traditional legislature are usually above-average
<BR>
intelligence, and have a basic understanding of the legal system.  While
<BR>
appointing a small amount of leaders may limit the truest form of
<BR>
democracy, perhaps it is better than letting a large amount of uninformed
<BR>
people make the crucial decisions of the country.
<BR>
<P>The above idea is truly just that: an idea.  Any comments or suggestions
<BR>
are more than welcome.
