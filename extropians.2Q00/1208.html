BY DENNIS BYRNE  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
When was the last time you saw a documentary on hunger in America
<BR>
that dwelled on the differences between &quot;hunger&quot; and starvation&quot;?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Often the words are used interchangeably, when they aren't
<BR>
interchangeable. Hunger is a strong desire or need for food:
<BR>
children too groggy to learn; seniors in misery; homeless people
<BR>
humiliated by rummaging through Dumpsters. As President Clinton has
<BR>
said, many Americans may be surprised that, in our prosperity,
<BR>
other millions wake up hungry. Which is not to say they are waking
<BR>
up starving--dying from extreme lack of food. 
<BR>
<P>This is an important distinction made in &quot;The Hunger Heroes,&quot; a
<BR>
documentary to be aired at 10 p.m. Thursday on WTTW-Channel 11. It
<BR>
opens with singer Harry Belafonte saying, &quot;I have been hungry; I've
<BR>
never starved. My mother wouldn't let us starve.&quot;  
<BR>
<P>At last, a TV documentary that gives a balanced view on the
<BR>
problems of hunger in America. Some of those infrequently heard
<BR>
views include: &quot;giving free food is not fighting hunger,&quot; that
<BR>
freedom from hunger is not a civil right and avoiding hunger is as
<BR>
much, or more, a matter of personal responsibility as it is of an
<BR>
intervening government. 
<BR>
<P>The documentary is produced by Rick Roberts, former director of the
<BR>
Chicago Christian Industrial League, one of the city's largest
<BR>
homeless shelters. Roberts is a White House Points of Light award
<BR>
winner and former homeless advocate who has turned documentary film
<BR>
producer.
<BR>
<P>In his latest work, he presents a variety of opinions on hunger,
<BR>
including from such anti-hunger advocates as Belafonte, Danny
<BR>
Glover, Valerie Harper and Peter Yarrow of the folk singers Peter,
<BR>
Paul and Mary. Roberts asks whether hunger exists (it does, he
<BR>
concludes), and if so, why and how do you solve it. It is here,
<BR>
among the various regional solutions developed in New York City,
<BR>
Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Los Angeles and Miami, that Roberts
<BR>
finds differences of views. 
<BR>
<P>Lending balance to the often-expressed view that &quot;food security&quot; is
<BR>
a civil right, Roberts also focuses on the Greater Chicago Food
<BR>
Depository and its executive director, Mike Mulqueen, a politically
<BR>
conservative retired Marine Corps general. 
<BR>
<P>The Depository is a national model and Chicago's premier source for
<BR>
delivering food to people in need. It serves more than 560 soup
<BR>
kitchens, pantries and shelters, which in turn serve 200,000 to
<BR>
300,000 people each month. It is stocked by hundreds of food donors
<BR>
and is based on the model that those who receive food also should
<BR>
contribute through work, job training or in some other personally
<BR>
responsible fashion. 
<BR>
<P>Asked if food security is a civil right, Mulqueen responded, &quot;No.
<BR>
We have a responsibility in this nation--again, this is a moral
<BR>
imperative--we have a responsibility to take care of those who
<BR>
can't take care of themselves. We've got a responsibility to take
<BR>
care of our children, our senior citizens, our sick, our disabled.
<BR>
<P>But it's not an inherent right. People have a right to work. If
<BR>
you're able-bodied and you can work, you should be out there
<BR>
contributing to our society.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Throughout this documentary, there is a thread of difference: Do we
<BR>
engage in the old style approach of just handing out food? Do we
<BR>
engage in a new style of giving that seeks accountability and
<BR>
responsibility in return from those who are able?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Some may criticize this approach, saying that the purer motivation
<BR>
is found in giving food to the hungry without requiring anything in
<BR>
return. That's a nice sentiment, but the purer motivation for
<BR>
feeding the hungry is found in the moral imperative that Mulqueen
<BR>
and others find resting on their shoulders: to not just feed
<BR>
people, but to uplift them. It flows from a tradition of service
<BR>
that motivates Mulqueen, who said that as a Marine he was serving
<BR>
the nation. Now he is serving the community.
