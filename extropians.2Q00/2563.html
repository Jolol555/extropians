<EM>&gt; &gt; Death to 7 of 9, the Borg, Data, and Spock, proud upholders of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; frickin' *stupid* tradition that intelligent people are supposed to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unable to understand emotions.  Hail Gene Roddenbury, who managed to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more damage to American rationality than, well, just about anyone.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh, faaar too harsh on Roddenberry, Eliezer, waaay too negative.
</EM><BR>
Certainly
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GR's work had its shortcomings, but recall he was writing for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; television
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proletariat.  Furthermore, take a look at TV sci-fi of the late 60s.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Terrible!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Desolate wasteland!  Sci-fi was only a slight one-off from traditional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; horror
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flicks [Danger, Will Robinson!].
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Roddenberry suggested a future in which humanity was working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out problems, fixing things, overcoming.  Humans were not perfect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by any means, and yes, one did wish Spock had strangled Kirk that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time Spock got horny and challenged him to a dual.  And one wished
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that when Kirk was doing it with some green chick she would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transmogrify into Q.  That'd fix him.  {8^D
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But all in all, for 1967 it was one helllll of a cool series.  Homo
</EM><BR>
Sapiens
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grew into a really butt-kicking species, a meme that was amplified further
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the Next Generation.  Roddenberry can be forgiven for a few kooky
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memes, such as smart people are unemotional, the theory of parallel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolution, playing fast and loose with the physics of spacetime, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It was *too* cool for its time, thus the early cancellation.   spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Roddenberry might be excused for not knowing, but the damage is done.  The
<BR>
conflation of irrational with emotional and rational with unemotional,
<BR>
sadly, has a longer history than Mr. Spock, extending back to the Ancients,
<BR>
but _Star Trek_ gave it a concrete portrayal that people confuse with the
<BR>
real thing.
<BR>
<P>Even though I agree with Eleizer, the problem should not be assigning blame.
<BR>
Instead, it's how to overcome the stereotype here and now.
<BR>
<P>Also, we should raise standards for our expectations of TV SF.  I was not
<BR>
alive when _Star Trek_ first aired, so I have no idea of what the television
<BR>
landscape was like, but there's been a lot of stuff since then.  Sadly,
<BR>
though TV science fiction remains way below what it could be.  How can we
<BR>
change this?  Suggestions, aside from violence and destruction, would be
<BR>
appreciated.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
