Damien so giftedly penned the words:
<BR>
Then he saw himself clearly, abandoning embarrassment, forgetting
<BR>
pettiness, seeing as well, before him, in the figure of his wife, the
<BR>
mechanism which had written those sweet, those savage letters.
<BR>
<P>The 'bot he had never known!  And somehow he sensed deep within his most 
<BR>
hard-wired circuits that Sallywas seeing him in the same perspective, seeing 
<BR>
him as her shining servomech, that passionate machine which until now had 
<BR>
always been afraid to speak its wonder and joy. With darkly brooding 
<BR>
sensuality, Bruce Diode rolled across the floor to his wife.
<BR>
<P>Yes, and Sally looked back at him and saw a little funny machine like a 
<BR>
Singer Sewer, and she forgave him the endless irritations, the selfishness, 
<BR>
the private detective paperbacks, the humorless pedestrian dreariness of 
<BR>
him, for he was, after all, and at last, her great and shining hero.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Ahhhhh, such a sweet story.  You are a romantic underneath it all. :)  I 
<BR>
could see you writing for &quot;True Romance Stories&quot; when they are purchased by 
<BR>
&quot;Amazing&quot; and given a science fiction overlay to the romantic themes!  Ever 
<BR>
see the film _Heartbeeps_?  It reminded me alot of the world you created 
<BR>
here.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John
