<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, it was me who said the first bit (pre [...]), not John.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Locations? Britain (London, Liverpool), Amsterdam, Rome, Venice, Naples,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Paris. The apathy toward rape incident occured in London. In Rome my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; father's rental car was broken into and his camera bag was stolen, mom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; was pickpocketed in Venice....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rome, believe it or not, is reputedly the car theft capital of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Europe, outstripping the nearest contending city by a factor of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; three. Pickpocketing is an occupational hazard in _every_ city -- in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Europe or elsewhere -- that is a major tourist destination.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can't comment on the rape incident. However I'd like to note that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only place I've ever been mugged was San Francisco -- does this mean that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I should assume all American cities are violent and dangerous places where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the natives don't give a shit about street crime?
</EM><BR>
<P>Curiously, the only place I've been victimzed by crime was in SF as well, my
<BR>
truck was broken into and pilfered on top of Russian Hill.
<BR>
<P>As to your question: generally, yes. Actually, if you check out the local gun
<BR>
laws, you'll find the degree of freedom with weapons for law abiding people is
<BR>
inversely proportional to the crime rate. Also, the number and percentage of
<BR>
weapons violations that are prosecuted and convicted will have a similar
<BR>
correlation (i.e. Operation Exile type programs).
<BR>
<P>My local area, while not a big city, does have over 200,000 people within a 35
<BR>
mile radius. Most people don't lock their houses or their cars. Our local
<BR>
homicide rate is lower than most european countries, while our property crime
<BR>
rate is only a few percent of that typical of european countries.
<BR>
<P>BTB: I just noticed they found a truck with 48 bodies in it in England. Will
<BR>
those be classified as 'accidental' deaths or is someone actually going to be
<BR>
prosecuted for it? Will they now be passing a ban on trucks due to their role as
<BR>
tools of mass murder?
