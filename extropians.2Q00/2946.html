<EM>&gt; &gt;       I think that it therefor could be argued that it is very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; selfish on your part to put this suffering and loneliness on and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; making it so hard on those that remain after you are gone.  (Of course
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we could be considered selfish by not wanting you to die if such is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; truly against your will! ;) Your life may not be more important than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anyone elses, but it is also no less important either.  Every single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; life is important isn't it!? Any singularity must make this more true,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not less true don't you think!?  How or why would anyone ever think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; otherwise?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't want to die.  I very much want to see the Singularity.  And it
<BR>
goes without saying that I would care about the suffering and loneliness
<BR>
of the people who cared about me.  One, you're humans, and suffering is
<BR>
wrong; two, you're humans who tend to be important to the Singularity,
<BR>
and suffering might detract from that; three, I care about you, too.
<BR>
<P>Even so, the decrease in pain and suffering that might result from
<BR>
signing up for cryonics is not as great as the decrease in pain and
<BR>
suffering that could be brought about by helping the Singularitarians
<BR>
who remain, or (since I haven't, in fact, signed up for insurance)
<BR>
brought about by spending my money on Singularitarian efforts now.
<BR>
<P>Besides which, I don't care if it's selfish, ha, ha!  I'm not the kind
<BR>
of altruist who feels guilty about being called selfish!
<BR>
<P>I'm the kind of altruist who feels guilty about being called
<BR>
&quot;irrational&quot;, or even worse,  &quot;observer-biased&quot;.

<EM>&gt; True, he chose his ends, but he quite obviously *hasn't* chosen

<EM>&gt; himself as one of them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not exactly.  As far as I'm concerned, people are ends in themselves,
<BR>
*including* myself.  I will continue in both opinions unless the reasons
<BR>
behind them are definitely and unambiguously contradicted.  It's just
<BR>
that, at least in theory, my life is not intrinsically worth more than
<BR>
anyone else's, and is therefore a vanishing quantity in any equation
<BR>
which refers to six billion people.  I will confess to the extremely
<BR>
immodest but factually correct belief that my actions now have a
<BR>
significant probability of saving billions of lives, which provides a
<BR>
utilitarian justification for socially acceptable forms of selfishness
<BR>
such as not shipping all my money to starving Freedonia or whatever. 
<BR>
But that rationale just doesn't hold for any society advanced enough to
<BR>
practice revivification, so the good provided by cryonic suspension is a
<BR>
vanishing quantity.

<P>&quot;This is the Alcor Emergency Suspension Team!  Freeze!&quot;
