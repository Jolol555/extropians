Science Frontiers, No. 127, Jan-Feb, 2000
<BR>
<P>Not too long ago, geologists adamantly denied that there were any large
<BR>
meteor craters pockmarking our planet.  Now, they find 100-kilometer
<BR>
craters on a regular basis.  And scientists are casting worried looks
<BR>
at those near-earth asteroids, knowing that one day one will be on a
<BR>
collision course.
<BR>
<P>Not to worry, say the modern-day Technocrats, we will launch nuclear-armed
<BR>
rockets that will nudge such cosmic threats into harmless trajectories.
<BR>
<P>These Pollyannas are presumptuous.  They assume that asteroids are hard,
<BR>
cohesive objects that will be shoved aside by a few megatons of explosive
<BR>
energy.  There are two things wrong with this idea, and these reveal how
<BR>
radically our ideas about the nature of asteroids have changed in just
<BR>
10 years.
<BR>
<P>First, most astronomers will now agree that asteroids are orbiting rubble
<BR>
piles rather than monolithic objects.  For example, the near-earth
<BR>
asteroid Mathilde, 53 kilometers in diameter, has a density of only
<BR>
1.3 grams/cubic centimeter.  Its porosity must be greater than 50%.
<BR>
It is not a hard, coherent object.  Instead of a bullet, it is more
<BR>
like a cloud of shotgun pellets.  It would be hard to divert all this
<BR>
debris with a nuclear blast.
<BR>
<P>[Photo/sketch caption]:
<BR>
Many asteroids are really probably only plum-puddings of accreted debris.
<BR>
<P>To make matters worse, asteroids like Mathilde are stickier than a cloud
<BR>
of buckshot.  This fact is deduced from photos of asteroids showing many
<BR>
to be marked by huge craters.  (Mathilde has one 33 kilometers wide.)
<BR>
K.R. Housen et al, using laboratory tests and scaling data, argue that
<BR>
asteroid craters were not blasted out by collision.  (Mathilde is not
<BR>
&quot;shattered&quot; as one would expect given such a huge crater.)  Rather, the
<BR>
craters are &quot;dents&quot; instead of holes!  Cosmic rubble piles are like
<BR>
sponges.  Collisions with other rubble piles result in compression of the
<BR>
target surface and accretion of the smaller object.  In effect, asteroids
<BR>
are energy absorbers and will hardly be fazed by a nuclear detonation.
<BR>
<P>(Asphaug, Erik; &quot;Survival of the Weakest,&quot; Nature, 402:127, 1999.
<BR>
<P>Comment.  We are doomed---but not right away.
<BR>
