<EM>&gt; &gt; ActiveX components are simply Windows executables. Making a runtime for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them would basically mean making a runtime to allow Windows programs to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; run on other OS's. This is *not* a simple task, and not one Microsoft is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; willing to allow (they refuse to document the APIs, hence everything has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to be reverse-engineered). Witness the Wine project (allowing Windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; programs to run on Linux) - which has taken years to get as far as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has, and although an impressive job is *still* only experimental.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would hardly say only experimental. Witness the fact that the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Corel Word Perfect port depended totally on Wine. The fact WP is running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so well on linux now attests to that.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Linux port of WP runs native. Wine is not yet at the stage where it
<BR>
can be used as an alternative to porting software. It's just about
<BR>
solid with most Windows 3.1 software now (Word 6 is usable but slow).
<BR>
The 95/98/NT API's still have a lot of unknown factors.
<BR>
<P>Corel do have involvement with Wine (they are now funding the project),
<BR>
and there is much speculation about them finishing that instead of
<BR>
making native Linux ports.
<BR>
<P>That isn't *really* feasible - although if the current proposed
<BR>
Microsoft ruling goes through and the API information is made available,
<BR>
development can step up very quickly. For a long while, people were
<BR>
reluctant to fund it 
<BR>
<P>I believe Corel's move was probably more based on a plan to, having
<BR>
established themselves in the Linux distribution market, boost the
<BR>
spread of Linux by giving it solid Windows application support.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; You don't need to know what all the undocumented API hooks in Windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are to have a good ActiveX interpreter. You only need it to know what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the public will be writing to in their own ActiveX components, AND you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can build it to be more secure than MS's own ActiveX implementation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Insisting on knowing every hidden 'feature' of windows is a cop out that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-MS people try to use as an excuse to get under the hood. Its a whine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by mediocre coders who want everything to be explained to them and done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for them, rather than having to figure it out for themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe one could make an ActiveX interpreter, but at the time ActiveX was
<BR>
released there was only the one very insecure, and platform specific,
<BR>
implementation. No-one had any reason to build a better one, and
<BR>
everyone had plenty of reason to drop it on the floor immediately.
<BR>
<P>Bear in mind that from the point of view of a Web site designer there is
<BR>
no reason to use ActiveX.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;- because doing so immediately cuts out a portion of your potential
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visitors.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;- because you then have to implement another version for viewers
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without ActiveX support.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;- because it offers no functionality that cannot already be provided by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a cross-platform alternative, Java.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;- because it is a known security risk that will mean people not wishing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to use it from your site.
