<EM>&gt; &gt;  Seriously, I figured some of you might want to read more on the book
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  that comments might ensue.  I see nothing wrong with wanting to stoke
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  fires of debate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Look,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I had known that this was only about a &quot;debate&quot; war to be stoked, I'd
</EM><BR>
<P>Must have used the wrong word.  I was unaware that Nadia assumed debates are
<BR>
wars that must be won or lost.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; never have taken the time to answer your questions about what the
</EM><BR>
standards
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of art education were. I thought you were intrerested in my knowledge, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now I find it's a one way street where you only want use debate tactics,
</EM><BR>
so
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you can -- win win win?
</EM><BR>
<P>I replied to her questions, agreeing with her on several points.  I see by
<BR>
her above answer that she has locked on to the word &quot;debate&quot; and is now
<BR>
closed to any further communication.  Guess, the myth of Nadia's open mind
<BR>
is finally shattered.  Didn't think my joking comment would be the one to do
<BR>
it.:/
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Come on pals,  let's move to another corner of the party where someone is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intersted in communication, not debate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, I've taken the time to respond to a lot of Nadia's and other people's
<BR>
points here.  I've made the effort to separate what I thought was wrong from
<BR>
what I thought was right.  All of you can reread my posts if you disagree
<BR>
with me here and tell me where I've only been out to &quot;win win win.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I guess what Nadia expects here was for me to bow down before her, accepting
<BR>
all her views as true, never disagreeing except to uphold the sham of her
<BR>
&quot;communication.&quot;  If that's the case, then there is no point in
<BR>
communication.  A direct and parting shot at Nadia: Has she even thought she
<BR>
might be wrong about anything she's said during this entire thread?  I
<BR>
didn't think so!
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
