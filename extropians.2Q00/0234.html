<P>After a while those of us who have persistent nicknames tend
<BR>
to think of ourselves by that name.  I feel more like spike
<BR>
than I do Greg.  {8^D   I thought of an ASCII nickname for
<BR>
Zero Powers:  0 ^ ^
<BR>
<P>Now, regarding the subject we have been having so much fun
<BR>
with the last couple weeks.  There was a good show on the
<BR>
tube last night called &quot;Are You Being Watched?&quot;  all about
<BR>
anti-crime cams, mostly in Britain.
<BR>
<P>Then just today the May issue of Air and Space came in the
<BR>
post.  On page 55 is an article titled &quot;Microspies: Can tiny
<BR>
spacecraft deliver the big picture?&quot;  It is about bugs carrying
<BR>
cameras, among other things, and I gotta tell ya, it is about the
<BR>
most wicked cool thing Ive seen in a long time.
<BR>
<P>A week ago I was ruminating about a 4 gram cam and speculated
<BR>
that the sub gram cams would come soon.  This issue reports one
<BR>
that is &quot;.05 ounce&quot; which, if expressed in understandable units comes
<BR>
to 1.4 grams.
<BR>
<P>The article covers something I have been wondering about: there are
<BR>
lower limits to how far down we can scale airplanes due to very
<BR>
low Reynolds number problems.  There is bigtime research going
<BR>
on in very low Re.
<BR>
<P>I figure it will be far better to use actual bugs if the cams get much
<BR>
smaller than 1.4 grams.  Many of the most vexing problems have
<BR>
already been worked out by bugs, and furthermore I thought of
<BR>
a scheme which would obviate my previous notion of neurohacking
<BR>
the little beasties:  we would mount tiny devices on their two aft
<BR>
legs which could be deployed independently to create more drag
<BR>
on one side than the other, creating a long gentle turn.  Or perhaps
<BR>
use just one of them, so we can turn her in only one direction, but
<BR>
that should suffice to make slow gentle loops around Mike Lorrey's
<BR>
back yard...
<BR>
<P>Kidding Mike, bygones.  Nowthen, I suppose this is an example of
<BR>
an engineer (me) being seduced by a problem that is totally evil to work
<BR>
on, but is compelling because it is so wicked cool.  If we could think
<BR>
of legitimate uses tho....
<BR>
<P>Got one: how about sphex-cams to scope out terrorists like those that
<BR>
took that embassy down in South America and held hostages?  Or how
<BR>
about a bug's eye view of a football game?  Or have you ever wondered
<BR>
what *really* goes on down in the sphex's burrow?  Or use it to look
<BR>
for lost hikers in the mountains?  Lost pets in the neighborhood?  Cowboys
<BR>
use it to count cows?  spike
