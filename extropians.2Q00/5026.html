<EM>&gt; &gt; For about 15 minutes, at age 15, I was convinced I was a communist....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I remember when I was, oh, 7 or so, saying something offhand to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mother along the lines of &quot;from each according to his ability, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each according to his needs.&quot;  As I recall I had come up with this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whole theory myself.   She said if I wasn't careful people might start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;calling me Karl Marx.   I had no idea what she was talking about so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;looked it up.  After a bit of further reading, that was the end of that!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But it made great sense at the time.
</EM><BR>
<P>I hate to post this for fear of reinforcing the &quot;fascist&quot; label that some on 
<BR>
this list have thrown my way, but here goes...
<BR>
<P>I would not be so quick to give up on communism.  It has been adulterated by 
<BR>
those modern regimes who now call themselves communist, and its true that 
<BR>
current conditions probably do not lend themselves to an effective form of 
<BR>
communism but, eventually, I believe Marx will prove to have been on to 
<BR>
something good.

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
