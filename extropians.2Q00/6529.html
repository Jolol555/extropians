<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; - Although I am not aware of any particular progress towards this goal, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; makes perfect sense that soon, physical birth will be a thing of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;past.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It's dangerous, takes up a lot of time and energy, and I hear that it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hurts too. If I see a company which is making any progress towards 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;womb-less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; birth (via some kind of incubator), I'm going to invest my life savings.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I wouldn't at first. While I agree that in vitro wombs make excellent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sense (once the technology is developed far enough) *rationally*,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;childbearing is an intensely emotional, (dare I say it?) spiritual and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;socioculturally enmeshed affair that radical changes of it will at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;best take time. There will likely be some demand for it, and it might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;increase over time, but I wouldn't expect a sizeable group of parents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;immediately adopting it. It is something new, possibly frightening,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expensive and lacks the emotional buffering caused by a traditional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pregnancy.
</EM><BR>
<P>My expectation on early adoption would be that many pregnancies would still 
<BR>
be natural, because many pregnancies are accidental - or semi-accidental 
<BR>
(someone wants to have children at one point, or whenever it happens, and 
<BR>
one day it happens). Among people planning to have children, I'd think maybe 
<BR>
50/50.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; - It is possible to seperate X-chromosome bearing sperm from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Y-chromosome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bearing sperm in a test tube, thus making it possible to choose the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gender
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of your child (and I think it is even being practiced somewhat). In many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cultures, female children are not valued as much as men children. The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of this technology is based on the fact that it will skew gender 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;populations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as almost everyone chooses to have male children. I would not expect 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be widespread at least in US culture, although a 60/40 skew is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unimagineable. In extreme male-supremecist cultures like that being 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;endorsed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in Afghanistan, I would expect a 90/10 skew. The short term, social 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of this would be bad. I'd expect to see an intensification of attitudes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which treat women as property. Long term and biologically, I'd expect to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a general increase in any ability which has to do with survival, health,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wealth accumulation, and attracting a mate. The reason for this is that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only 10% of the population were female, only 20% of the population would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; breed. With the roughly 50/50 mix we have now, anyone who is fertile can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have a child. The &quot;most fit&quot; males and females hookup with eachother, as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the &quot;least fit&quot; males and females. If only 11% of the male population 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; breeding, the &quot;least fit&quot; 89% would be weeded out. In this case, whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;fit&quot; in the Darwinian sense correlates with good or desirable in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;moral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sense is debatable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You assume several things here that I find doubtful.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;First is that a gender inbalance would reinforce the misogynic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tendencies, when it could just as well lead to an increased value of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;women.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd considered this but didn't mention it in my post because I was thinking 
<BR>
mainly about the biological - I think there would be an &quot;increase in value&quot; 
<BR>
for women, but as property. I do not think it would lead to greater freedom 
<BR>
and independence. In countries where women are already treated as property, 
<BR>
such as Afghanistan, this would lead to a superficial improvement in the 
<BR>
quality of life for women.
<BR>
Something I hadn't considered - would these nations take part in the 
<BR>
practice? Afghanistan is not exactly a center of scientific research. I 
<BR>
guess I would expect them to, but only several decades after it were 
<BR>
available.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Second, you assume that fit individuals in a population where few can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reproduce will hook up with each other. First, fitness in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evolutionary sense (many grandchildren) have little to do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;survival, health and wealth accumulation today - it would be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who reproduced more that would be the winners, and as a general
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rule the higher the level of education and social status in modern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;societies the fewer kids on average. Second, you assume that in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scenario the good properties would be significantly inhereited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(genetically or memetically) - this may hold only for some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;properties. Third, it assumes that only the best mate with the best,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which is also not necessarily true.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm very aware of the fact that my sense of what it &quot;Best&quot;, in the moral 
<BR>
sense, correlates only slightly with what is &quot;best&quot; in the Darwinian sense.
<BR>
But, in the Darwinian sense, I think that the &quot;best&quot; do hook up with 
<BR>
eachother. People generally end up paired with others of similar 
<BR>
attractiveness. Think of people you know - I am sure that many instances 
<BR>
will spring to mind immediately where this is not true, where a very 
<BR>
physically unnatractive person has a very attractive mate - but these are 
<BR>
exceptions and definitely not the majority. Just look around next time you 
<BR>
are in a restaurant.
