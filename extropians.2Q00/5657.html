<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly I don't find immigration laws to be inhumane.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why are they a bad idea?...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; ...societies that produce excessive numbers of people should pay the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; costs of those problems themselves, not pawn them off on others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm surprized at you, Michael.  Open borders are a bedrock of the free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; market economy, and a simple consequence of granting the same basic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rights of free travel and association to those born on one side of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; imaginary line as we do to those born on the other.  Nationalism is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unbecoming rational minds.  &quot;Excessive people&quot; are a resource to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cherished, not a burden.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't look at it as a nationalist issue, its an economic AND ecological issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Open borders for TRADE are a bedrock of a free market economy. The existing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; members of a free market economy should also have the ability to control the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quality of life in their communities. If people living elsewhere want a high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quality of life like we do, then they should work to recreate our success where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are at. Part of that is re-engineering their society. Societies that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produce more people than can be sustained on their resources not only degrade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their own quality of life, by exporting the results of their bad social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reproduction policies to our countries, they not only perpetuate a dumb idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where they are at, but they export people who will perpetuate those same dumb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas elsewhere.
</EM><BR>
<P>The only &quot;dumb idea&quot; here is that resources are finite, and that it is
<BR>
even possible to &quot;overpopulate&quot; an area.  Julian Simon and others have
<BR>
done a good job of debunking those.  But even if it /is/ true, free
<BR>
market solutions including basic travel can work to solve those
<BR>
shortages as well.  Travel is fundamental to trade. I have as much of a
<BR>
human right to buy land or rent a house or take a job in Mexico as any
<BR>
Mexican does to do the same here; any restriction on either is a
<BR>
restriction of trade just as much as a tarriff or embargo.  And if one
<BR>
side or the other has a culture that makes the other side more attractive,
<BR>
travel is one way for the market to express that preference and make
<BR>
incentives for change.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I see this all the time, with flatlanders moving up here to the sticks. THey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want the high quality of life that we have living up here, but once they get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here they go about trying to change our community and its laws into the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sort of shithole they came from, then they wonder why everything has gone to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shit. When my parents moved up here from Massachusetts when I was a kid, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understood this, and we learned to live like the people around here lived.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem causing that is government, not immigration.  In a free
<BR>
market, the flatlanders could only screw up their own land, not yours.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Opening your borders with any economy that does not behave as yours does only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opens your own economy up to being degraded by its association. Take our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relationship with China, for example. We as a nation are benefitting from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slave labor practices of the People's Republic of China. Their cheap products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are keeping our inflation low. But our morals and ethics have been degraded, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are externalizing the cost of the products we want onto the backs of the chinese
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laborer who is not paid, or is paid little for his forced labor. I personally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try to boycott any chinese made product. If I know a product was made in China,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I won't buy it. I would guess though that probably half of the stuff in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apartment was made in china, or parts or resources for the stuff was made in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; china.
</EM><BR>
<P>Human rights abuse is a problem; foreign &quot;behavior&quot; is not, unless it is
<BR>
actually crime.  Of course foreign customs are different--if that bugs
<BR>
you, that's your problem, not theirs, unless they actually trespass on
<BR>
your rights somehow.  Their markets &quot;behave&quot; differently--of course.  If
<BR>
they work better, learn from them.  If they work worse, outcompete them.
<BR>
That's what freedom is about.  But a free market does work better when
<BR>
we fight to protect the rights of everyone to participate; but just
<BR>
closing our eyes (and borders) to the problem won't help anyone.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If we opened immigration to everyone that wanted to live here, we'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shortly have 6 billion people living in the US, starving to death.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, poppycock.  We'd have 6 billion people making the biggest,
<BR>
strongest, cleanest, most diverse, most magnificent economy the world
<BR>
has ever seen, assuming the government doesn't intervene to screw it up.
<BR>
But even that is less likely--with an influx of immigrants, states
<BR>
would be falling over themselves to eliminate welfare laws and
<BR>
other handouts so that the people would /have/ to be productive.
<BR>
