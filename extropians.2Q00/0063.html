<EM>&gt; I have to confess that I've only been skimming this thread due to the volume,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I think I see that the discussion is being carried out about what might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a straw man, i.e. the notion of truly UNIVERSAL surveillance.  I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help but wonder whether the discussion might be more fruitful if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered more possible scenarios.  For instance, what if a community
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decided that all police officers had to have a &quot;shoulder cam&quot; that recorded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only when that officer was on duty, extending the highway patrol car
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;pull-over&quot; cams that have been in use in new Jersey now for a year or so?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or even less intrusive, that courts were to decide that a search or an arrest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that wasn't recorded was presumptively unconstitutional?  Or that an oral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contract that wasn't recorded was voidable? Could those be bad things?
</EM><BR>
<P>Aytime you have a meeting between a person who has a whole lot more
<BR>
power than the other, and is intent on using it, it behooves the
<BR>
interests of liberty to ensure that that interaction is just. Similarly,
<BR>
recording contract discussions, or at least contract signing meetigns,
<BR>
are useful, however there is the problem of allowing the courts or
<BR>
participating parties to the contract getting the wording of a contract
<BR>
modified after the fact based on the recording, even though they had
<BR>
previously reviewed the contract and agreed to its provisions.
<BR>
<P>And I don't think that truly universal surveillance is a straw man.
<BR>
Without truly universal coverage, the purported benefits of the system
<BR>
for fighting crime are greatly diminished, and I don't see the point of
<BR>
creating such a system and such a confiscation of human rights unless
<BR>
these benefits are secured. Without the full benefits, the cost-benefit
<BR>
of the liberty-security transfer is not to the advantage of the
<BR>
individual.
