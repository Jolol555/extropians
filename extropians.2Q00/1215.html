<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The United States Senator from New York Daniel Patrick Moynihan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; famously observed some years back that he had learned from the Federal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; government's own statistics people upon comissioning a review that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distance from a state capital to Canada had several times the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; statistical correlation with results on standardized tests in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state than did the amount of money spent per pupil.  (Specifically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the closer to Canada, the better the scores.)  He joked that the thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to do was move the state capitals to the northern border of each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state. ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thats probably about as close to a racist remark as a liberal feels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; comfortable with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I assume you're talking about Moynihan and not me, because I'm no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; liberal.  In any event, in what way is that at all racist?  (Unless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you're assuming the problem is poor performance by white people.)  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; northeast and California are probably more ethnically diverse than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rest of the country at large, and with California's capital at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Sacramento, almost as far north as Trenton, the capital of New Jersey,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; California and the northeast states would all be contributing to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; performance on standardized tests that would get correlated to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; closeness to Canada.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was referring to Moynihan. Actually his comment makes a direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implication that the sliding scale of test scores as you move south is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directly related to the percent of the population that is black or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hispanic, which, no, the Northeast does not have a higher percentage of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; black people or hispanics than southern states. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Wow, you must be a mindreader!  I see no such implication in
<BR>
Moynihan's statement.
<BR>
<P>Moynihan was responding to calls for greater Federal funding.  It has
<BR>
long been noted that on standardized test scores many southern states
<BR>
do less well than many northern states.  He had some statistical
<BR>
bureau compare the possibility that state performance on tests
<BR>
correlates to dollars (in rejecting the &quot;throw money at the problem
<BR>
approach&quot; Moynihan was actually taking a typically conservative
<BR>
position here), or correlates to distance from the capital to Canada.
<BR>
These would presumably be compared with a &quot;null hypothesis&quot; that the
<BR>
differences can be set down to chance, in a statistical analysis of
<BR>
the hypothesis.  The results showed a much stronger statistical
<BR>
correlation to northern capital latitude than to bucks.  The point he
<BR>
was making was that dollars are not the whole answer.
<BR>
<P>If you want to call such a correlation racist, you can go ahead, but I
<BR>
don't see it.  I do see that it draws attention to regional
<BR>
differences.  I am by no means convinced that the numbers can be
<BR>
attributed mostly to race, as I do not know about racial distribution
<BR>
by state, and would welcome any pointers to such demographic results,
<BR>
if only because I hate navigating such discussions without hard data.
<BR>
Your answer certainly does not deal with the case of California.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; While New York City does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the largest puerto rican community in the US,
</EM><BR>
<P>New York City can be seen as having an all minority population at this
<BR>
point, if you accept Latino as a primary racial grouping.  Whites,
<BR>
Blacks, Asians and Latinos are all minority groups.  Even more
<BR>
interesting, foreign born is almost as common a status as U.S. born.
<BR>
<P>BTW, since Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, the demographics there can
<BR>
easily shift over time.  Any Puerto Rican who moves to the U.S. can
<BR>
immediately participate in the U.S. as a full citizen, including
<BR>
voting in local elections and everything else, and any U.S. citizen
<BR>
who moves to Puerto Rico can immediately partcipate as a Puerto Rican
<BR>
in the political life of Puerto Rico, voting in local elections and
<BR>
having no voting representation in the U.S. Congress, just like any
<BR>
other Puerto Rican.  So what it means to be &quot;Puerto Rican&quot; can rapidly
<BR>
change in the manner that what it means to be a &quot;New Yorker&quot; or a
<BR>
&quot;Coloradan&quot; can change, due to internal migration of groups within the
<BR>
U.S. and its territories.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  northern New York
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state dilutes the actual percent of state population that is hispanic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down to a small percentage.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but overall the state is still pretty ethnically diverse; seven
<BR>
or eight million of its 18 million residents live in the City, and
<BR>
over 50% of those seven or eight million are non-white.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Beyond that, his statement is actually false in at least one respect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Montpelier VT is I think the clostest state capital to Canada (I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sure of the distance of Lansing from Ontario), at least closer than NH,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and NH has always maintained slightly better test scores than Vermont.
</EM><BR>
<P>The test was an aggregate statistical analysis of all 50 states.  If
<BR>
it held perfectly true, than the statistical correlation would be one.
<BR>
If it were absolutely untrue, the statistical correlation would be
<BR>
negative one.  If the results showed no greater correlation than the
<BR>
null hypothesis, the correlation would be at 0.  The correlation was
<BR>
somewhere between 0 and 1, but significantly larger than the
<BR>
correlation to dollars spent.  This means that you can find cases
<BR>
where it will not hold true.
<BR>
<P>The accuracy of Moynihan's statement of a correlation is based
<BR>
entirely on the accuracy of the figures, and the analysis performed.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I personally think the difference may well be attributable to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; northern states going more industrial earlier, and later becoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; richer, as well as the likelihood that kids stay in and study during
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the long, cold, darker winters.  North Dakota produces a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; disproportionate number of high school math prodigies and I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; think it's some racial superiority of the North Dakotans :-).  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hypothesize, off the top of my head that maybe being way out in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; middle of nowhere, plus in a place where it's too cold to hang out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; outside much of the year, helps some kids focus on their studies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Possibly, or maybe they are raised, in fact, to obey and respect their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parents more than city kids who rarely spend time at home or obey their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parents.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>Whatever.  I was raised in New York City and knew plenty of kids whom
<BR>
this sweeping generalization inaccurately describes.  Moreover many of
<BR>
the students at the nation's top colleges and universities come from
<BR>
New York City, as do a great many desperately uneducated people.  I
<BR>
find it hard to imagine you could have any kind of reasonable dataset
<BR>
for drawing your sweeping conclusion, though I am always prepared to
<BR>
be pleasantly surprised.  And some of the most prodigious intellects
<BR>
it is my pleasure to know largely defined themselves in important
<BR>
personal acts of rebellion, in some cases against tyrannical parents.
<BR>
All I know is growing up in the big city served me and my family well.
<BR>
<P>All the best!
