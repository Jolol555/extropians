Summer approaches.  I'm having the annual &quot;There must be a better
<BR>
way!&quot; argument with myself about maintaining a reasonable shirtsleeve
<BR>
environment.  I hate using lots of electricity to power motors to
<BR>
drive compressors to do things that really should just be a fabric
<BR>
hanging in the window.  And my extant solution requires that the
<BR>
whole shebang be duplicated, just for one room.
<BR>
<P>How about a nano approach using mechanical filters?   H2O vapor is
<BR>
significantly larger as a molecule than the gasses that I want to be
<BR>
breathing.  Surely some kind of filter material,  and a fan (I'm a
<BR>
huge fan of the silent electrostatic air movers) and
<BR>
something that scavenged the distilled water so that it doesn't
<BR>
re-evaporate.   Actually, I don't even want to bother condensing it,
<BR>
let's just route it back outside.   So, we come down to a window-unit
<BR>
with a sort of a prismatic air-splitter and a Zenion accelerator. It
<BR>
doesn't even sound expensive. 
<BR>
<P>I want to set up a dehumidifier, but the only ones that I know of use
<BR>
appalling amounts of energy and then require me to pump that waste
<BR>
energy back out of the building via AC.  I'd even like to have one in
<BR>
my music studio, but the studio is a serious BTU hazard as it is.
<BR>
In winter, opening a window is really nice in that room.
<BR>
<P>I happen to like the central AC in this building, as it is very
<BR>
quiet and thus non-disruptive of thinking and quiet music, but it is
<BR>
architecturally non-dehumidifiying, and not powerful enough to
<BR>
overcome the waste heat of a dehumidifier on top of my lifestyle.  
<BR>
<P>My evil, evil, thought for the day is running the dehumidifier with
<BR>
the hot air output piped to the stove hood stovepipe (which goes up
<BR>
five floors into the open air).
