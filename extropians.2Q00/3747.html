<EM>&gt; I think we as transhumanists are a bit in a dilemma here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On one hand we are pro medical freedom, since we want access to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; treatments for e.g. life extension, cognitive enhancement and physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improvements. We are also opposed to straightjacking the definition of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; health and disease since that could easily lead to a situation where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only one or a few forms of bodily plans are acceptable; in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; safeguard our morphological freedom we need to give others their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom too.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see much of a dilemma here.  A dilemma implies any choice loses.  I
<BR>
have no problem with freedom in general.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But on the other hand we are pro rationality and in general opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superstition and pseudoscience. While we might let people do whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they want with their lives and money, we should not let disinformation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spread unchecked. If people cannot distinguish the real remedies and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improvements from the fakes, then money will be invested in the wrong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; products, the scientifically proven treatments we seek will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expensive since they are selected by few and worse, they will often be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mistaken for fakes and hence give transhumanism a bad name (&quot;Oh,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you're just a new age cult that likes to call itself scientific, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still take the same snake-oil!&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a matter of image.  In other words, if someone lumps us together with
<BR>
new agers, then it's up to us to convince them that this is not so.  I
<BR>
generally try when I talk to people about life extension to tell them I
<BR>
discount any hint of mysticism or irrationalism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Our situation is that by supporting medical freedom, we also place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ourselves in the same camp as a lot of groups we normally would want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to separate ourselves from - new agers, some luddites and a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pseudoscience. Politics does make strange bedfellows.
</EM><BR>
<P>So?  Advocating freedom of speech means one is also defeding the right of
<BR>
every halfwit and liar to speak up too.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Can we promote some ideas that support freedom and rationality?
</EM><BR>
<P>I maintain freedom and rationality require each other.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think so. One obvious would be to try to set up various forms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; independent consumer reviews and medical information sources, so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people can access high-quality information about medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; treatments. Instead relying on having the government blocking access
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to bad treatments, a reviewing system might be more flexible: review
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organisations (which need to maintain their good reputations) can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; review drugs and if they meet their standards the drug can be sold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with their seal of approval; different health organisations can then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; announce what review levels (and from who) they accept, in turn a step
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; towards good consumer information (this is just the same idea as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; independent review boards for scientific web publication I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned a few times on the list).
</EM><BR>
<P>Such organizations already exist -- at least on a small scale.  It's more a
<BR>
matter of getting rid of government bodies, such as the US FDA, which
<BR>
currently control drug approval.  In the US, e.g., the information on
<BR>
various drugs exists, but it's hard to get the information to the consumer
<BR>
with the current labeling laws.
<BR>
<P>(The abyssmal state of scientific journalism here is appalling too, though
<BR>
reading the BBC's web site, it appears the US does not have a monopoly on
<BR>
journalistic ignorance.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But no amount of organisation can help if people in general do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think critically about their medical treatments. Hence it is clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that to really get a free medical system to work with as few memetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parasites as possible, education and stimulation to critical thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and self-development is necessary. It is not an either-or question,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even a few sceptics can do a lot of good by exposing snake-oil, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the more people that employ critical thinking the better. Weird and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; often erroneous alternatives will be explored, but that is much better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than enforced conformity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Leave the meme speak out it.  It's a common sense matter.  If people never
<BR>
have the chance to take control of their health, then it's quite plain to
<BR>
see they will be irresponsible about it.  Given the freedom -- especially
<BR>
the freedom to fuck up and see others fucking up -- people will soon learn.
<BR>
No need to rephrase this in transhuman-babble.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
