<EM>&gt; Ok, point taken. Now counterpoint: OPEC. OPEC is a monopoly.

<P>No it isn't; OPEC is a cartel. There's a fundamental difference. In
<BR>
principle any of the members can quit whenever they feel it's in their
<BR>
best interests to do so. Moreover, OPEC adjusts its prices down as well
<BR>
as up, in reaction to variations in demand. What OPEC does is allow
<BR>
the oil producing nations to avoid getting into a cut-throat price war.
<BR>
Which will rapidly turn into a shooting war, in case you hadn't throught
<BR>
about the determinants of conflict in the Gulf War of 1981-88.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outside the US, and it exercises quite a bit of control over pricing in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many nations, but not in the US, however those prices have significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effects on prices in the US. The US does nothing about this monopoly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Looks like capricious enforcement to me..
</EM><BR>
<P>No; looks like you've got your definition wrong. Consumers in the USA
<BR>
are free to buy oil from non-OPEC producers like the UK (world's sixth
<BR>
largest oil exporter at one point) or Nigeria or Venezuela or Russia.
<BR>
In fact, they do. The reason OPEC decisions affect the price at the pump
<BR>
in the USA is because (a) the US government has sod-all by way of energy
<BR>
taxes (which is why your cars, domestic appliances, and so on are so
<BR>
inefficient -- there's no incentive to improve them) so minor tweaks in 
<BR>
the price of crude get passed on directly to the consumer, and (b) OPEC
<BR>
countries amount to a large proportion of global oil production, so the
<BR>
non-OPEC producers shadow their pricing.
<BR>
<P>If you remove OPEC, bad things happen:
<BR>
<P>Firstly, the price of oil crashes. Each oil producer in the middle east will
<BR>
start pumping like crazy in an attempt to maximize revenue, because everyone
<BR>
will be trying to undercut their neighbour and when you cut your prices you
<BR>
have to make it up on volume. 
<BR>
<P>Secondly, not long thereafter there'll be a horrendous oil
<BR>
shortage. Because of the price crash, oil will stop being a profitable
<BR>
business. Tankers will be laid up because it is too expensive to operate
<BR>
them. Wells will close; places like the North Sea/Shetland fields will
<BR>
be mothballed.
<BR>
<P>Basically, prices will yo-yo violently. The whole process will be aggravated
<BR>
by the diminishing reserves -- wildly fluctuating prices will discourage
<BR>
oil companies from exploring for new fields, too. 
<BR>
<P>Basically, OPEC stabilizes the marketplace. It's not a monopoly, so it
<BR>
is forced to take market forces into account -- that's why oil prices
<BR>
are currently lower (in real terms) than they were before the OPEC price
<BR>
hike of 1973.
<BR>
<P>For a Microsoft analogy, to give you a feel for how Microsoft looks to
<BR>
the outside world -- meaning, anyone not native to the USA -- imagine
<BR>
Microsoft was based in Saudi Arabia.  Microsoft has 90% of the operating
<BR>
system market. Your country is at their mercy. They behave weirdly at
<BR>
times, adding the Bible and other un-Islamic texts to the files deleted
<BR>
by their built-in virus checker.  They hike their prices whenever they
<BR>
feel like it and swear at you if you protest. And their government thumbs
<BR>
it's nose at you. Not exactly the world's best neighbours, no?
