<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; cleaners will mostl likely come first, will be just a box on wheels,

<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; and they will be considerably cheaper than a car.

<EM>&gt;  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Given that Honda's P2 and P3 can walk and climb stairs, why not program
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; them to use a vacuum cleaner?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) the price tag
</EM><BR>
<P>I took the price tag off. Once these machines can reproduce themselves,
<BR>
the market price should be peanuts. So the R&amp;D cost can be almost
<BR>
anything. How much would this planet pay for mechanical slaves which can
<BR>
do all the jobs humans do now and reproduce themselves as well?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;2) if they can walk stairs (I'd like to see it.
<BR>
<P>So far I'm only going by the pictures. Maybe when we get this ed tv
<BR>
program going I can shake hands with P3.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Can I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; push them while they'll be doing it?
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably not. But you can't push grandpa on the stairs either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; path?  Operate them while children/pets are present?),
</EM><BR>
<P>Presently it wouldn't be wise. But what about after $100 b. or $100
<BR>
t. R&amp;D?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;it doesn't mean
<BR>
<EM>&gt; they can vacuum a room. No sir. Anyone who wants my office cleaned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without turning it into a mess (it's all hidden order, I'm telling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you), he's facing a quite superhuman task.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes it is. Refer to my earlier question to you re whether the object
<BR>
recognition part of mapping/navigating is the bigger problem or the
<BR>
movement to the site and movement on site. But again, I'm taking the price
<BR>
tag off. As long as investors/buyers are convinced the R&amp;D will succeed,
<BR>
they could pay just about every cent they have.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; I agree. Now what could be done with 100 billion $ or 100 trillion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; $? These are the questions I am putting forward to the Vancouver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some of it can't be hurried, but some of it can. 100 gigabucks, now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that would be serious money. (100 terabucks is meaningless, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the market is not enough to absorb it without being changed radically)
</EM><BR>
<P>Isn't that the message of the &quot;transhuman&quot; era? It is the end of
<BR>
civilization as we know it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, I'd rather have it spent in nanotechnology and gerontology,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and space industry, if it was mine to command.
</EM><BR>
<P>The R&amp;D I'm talking about has to be a sure thing. Nanotech and extending
<BR>
life aren't sure things. So this is the mainstay of the ed tv show on
<BR>
robotics...how far can we go with sure things? What will they cost?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; television group which says it wants to do an ed tv documentary on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &quot;machine psychology&quot;. I want the top experts in the world to answer and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; think they will.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The phrase &quot;machine psychology&quot; is rather purple, considered that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even can't get the low-level motorics done properly.
</EM><BR>
<P>I define it as the extent to which machine systems can simulate
<BR>
psychological systems.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;So far, this
<BR>
<EM>&gt; falls under the cathegory &quot;algorithmic artefacts&quot;, at best.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which means?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Japan has pioneered some remarkably audacious and unremarkably failing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; projects in the past.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Hey...I remember the Alamo...or was it Pearl Harbour? Anyway, to use your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; expression, below, So what?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you point towards an ambitious AI project in Nippon, I can point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; towards a series of very impressive failures. Meaning, the fact alone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that Japan is doing a particular AI project is not sufficient to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me all wet and flushed. This doesn't mean that robotics is a dead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; horse, but this doesn't mean that particular project is going to go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; critical, either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Yes, so what.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Oh I can think of all kinds of so whats. Like &quot;robot robots&quot; which is what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know what &quot;robot robots&quot; are. Please explain before you use an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfamiliar term.
</EM><BR>
<P>Typo...&quot;robot rights&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; Pearson from BT expects to see happening in about a decade. Like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; transformation of society when it really is &quot;The End of Work&quot; (Rifkin's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The end of work? I thought we worked more and later hours, at reduced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wage. Humans are still a great deal more flexible, and cheaper than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robots. Only in very few areas are robots going to outperform the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price/performance on an illegal immigrant.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good point. As long as human slaves are cheap there will be reduced
<BR>
incentives for machine slaves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; title). And you know what? For those willing to use a little savvy (and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; don't mean just high tech people) I think the era of &quot;The End of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Work&quot; (total automation) has arrived. The choices are whether to go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &quot;anthropomorphic&quot; or &quot;nonanthropmorphic&quot; in planning totally automated new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, let's have this discussion by the time a breakeven point between 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human and robotic vehicles on the road has arrived.
</EM><BR>
<P>At this time we can go a long way by redesiging our environments to permit
<BR>
automation. For example the Sky Train here has operated since 1986 without
<BR>
any humans. If people want to use outmoded, costly, polluting and
<BR>
dangerous technology I can't stop them.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile, there
<BR>
<EM>&gt; are much juicier topics to sink our fangs into. Let's deal with them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as they arise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; communities. NOW.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the prospect of having a village built at False Creek with maximum
<BR>
automation is pretty juicy. I'll buy into it if it is as good as I think
<BR>
it can be. And I don't think they'll have a problem selling the other
<BR>
4,999 people!
