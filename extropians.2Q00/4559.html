<P>
Here's the stock market piece I referred to earlier, from Lee Flier, copied
<BR>
with her permission.  She's working on a book and would appreciate feedback.
<BR>
Her e-mail addy's at the bottom of this quote.  She asked me to include it
<BR>
in case any of you want to yell at her :-)
<BR>
<P>Bonnie
<BR>
<P>A question had been asked (by Gene) about the relative merits of land vs.
<BR>
the stock market as investments.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Well, that all depends whether you are looking at the small picture or the
<BR>
big picture.  I am something of a radical when it comes to the stock market.
<BR>
That is, I don't believe in it and support it as little as humanly possible.
<BR>
I often even wish it weren't such a hassle not to have a bank account,
<BR>
considering that banks invest their money in stocks, not to mention in
<BR>
companies whose activities I abhor.  But we can't live in a vacuum.  So - I
<BR>
simply refuse to invest in stock in publicly held companies, and try very
<BR>
hard to avoid working for public companies.  I'll try to summarize why:
<BR>
<P>When a company goes public, what it is basically doing is opening up its
<BR>
ownership to anyone who wants to invest in it.  There are benefits to doing
<BR>
this both for the company and the investor, and this is the &quot;side&quot; of
<BR>
investing that we always see presented: the company benefits because it gets
<BR>
a large influx of capital to further its research, development and growth;
<BR>
and the investor benefits of course by earning a nice return on the
<BR>
company's profits should it succeed, with a minimum of hassle, liability or
<BR>
involvement in the company's day to day affairs.
<BR>
<P>However, there are huge downsides to public companies, which are rarely
<BR>
discussed.  How many times have you complained that a company you used to
<BR>
frequent and trust as a customer has suddenly begun producing lower quality
<BR>
products, or has stopped caring about customer service?  How many of you
<BR>
have ever been employed by a company who used to treat workers fairly but
<BR>
bit by bit begins to expect too much work for too little pay, to downgrade
<BR>
working conditions, and to hire less and less competent new people as the
<BR>
competent ones are laid off or quit in disgust?  Or has a business who once
<BR>
served your community well just up and moved somewhere else in order to cut
<BR>
corners, leaving a huge void of jobs, goods or services?
<BR>
<P>All of these things are almost inevitable when a company goes public.
<BR>
Generally, the negative effects will not begin to make themselves felt until
<BR>
the corporation has been publicly held for at least 10 to 20 years, by which
<BR>
time the founders of the company may well have retired with a fat bank
<BR>
account.  That is why we usually don't connect the company's going public
<BR>
with its downslide.
<BR>
<P>Some of the reasons that being owned by the public is the beginning of the
<BR>
end for a successful business are basically the same reasons that a
<BR>
socialist economy doesn't work: 1) eventually no one person has much control
<BR>
of the company, not even its CEO, and 2) there are now many people who DO
<BR>
have control of the company but do not have a clue about its operations and
<BR>
care little about anything other than how the stock is performing.
<BR>
<P>Then too, for a stock to be any &quot;good&quot; it has to increase in value.  That
<BR>
means the company's profits MUST grow, to look good on the stock market.
<BR>
There are a few exceptions, like utility companies for example, but those
<BR>
are considered &quot;stodgy&quot; stocks - stocks that are always &quot;safe&quot; investments
<BR>
but will never make you rich.  By and large though, if a public company
<BR>
doesn't continually increase its profits it will lose stockholders.  So the
<BR>
things that must be done to increase profitability become more and more
<BR>
despicable as time goes on.
<BR>
<P>At first, there are generally majority shareholders in a public company -
<BR>
the founder(s) and their families, perhaps some key employees, and maybe
<BR>
some other corporations who have a vested interest in the company's success.
<BR>
So control is still maintained by a reasonable number of individuals all of
<BR>
whom know and care something about the business.  But if a company becomes
<BR>
hugely successful on the public market, it's inevitable that the
<BR>
professional investors will move in and begin buying up large amounts of
<BR>
stock, until after some period of years (especially after the founder
<BR>
retires), most of the stock is owned by people having nothing to do with the
<BR>
business and probably not even living in the same community, maybe not even
<BR>
the same country.  Furthermore, if you're the CEO of a public company and
<BR>
your stock is not performing well, your financial and operational records
<BR>
are open to the public.  If your shareholders can see that you have left
<BR>
some stone unturned in squeezing some more profitability out of your company
<BR>
(even if at the expense of workers, the environment, the customer, or the
<BR>
quality of the product or service), they can sue you for not acting in their
<BR>
interests.  So most companies within 20 years of offering public stock are
<BR>
merely trading on their past reputations.
<BR>
<P>Anyone could think of a few exceptions to this &quot;rule&quot;, but it happens often
<BR>
enough that I think the stock market needs to be &quot;called out&quot; as being the
<BR>
scourge on society that it is for all concerned.  I think that if you do
<BR>
want to invest in a company that you believe in, a wiser choice would be to
<BR>
either become a limited partner (in which case you are a PRIVATE shareholder
<BR>
and have a vested interest in the company's success), or to buy bonds.
<BR>
Bonds are more conservative in their returns than stocks, but they don't
<BR>
have the same drawbacks as stocks because their term is finite.  That is,
<BR>
you are still helping the company raise capital in return for a share of its
<BR>
profits, but when the bond matures the company no longer is beholden to the
<BR>
bondholder.  Thus a company can keep control over its resources and is not
<BR>
obligated to keep increasing its growth beyond all limits of reason.
<BR>
<P>Nearly all companies have a natural &quot;curve&quot; of growth - like living things,
<BR>
they MUST grow until they reach a certain level of maturity and stability.
<BR>
Every company will have a point at which they find themselves making a
<BR>
healthy profit while still treating workers fairly, engaging in fair
<BR>
competition without coercion or hostile takeovers, providing quality goods
<BR>
and service at reasonable prices, and being a good corporate citizen in the
<BR>
communities where they operate.  But the missing directive is: once this
<BR>
critical mass has been reached, the company needs to STOP growing.  This
<BR>
idea is almost unheard of in business schools, and what's more, it's nigh
<BR>
impossible to stop growing if your company is public.  Unless a huge degree
<BR>
of awareness exists in the majority shareholders (which is almost never the
<BR>
case, and even if it is the case now, the shares will probably eventually
<BR>
fall into the hands of someone less aware), it becomes like a monster whose
<BR>
only directive is to grow and which has no conscience because no one really
<BR>
controls it.
<BR>
<P>Soooo.... however tempting stocks may look to an individual, we all pay for
<BR>
our investments many times over - in loss of quality in our lives due to
<BR>
corporate needs being placed before human needs.  The only choice I feel
<BR>
that I can make therefore is not to serve this particular beast.  In any
<BR>
case, growth cannot continue indefinitely, and it's only growth at any cost
<BR>
that keeps the beast strong.  The stock market is basically like a giant
<BR>
pyramid scheme, each investor betting he'll get his before it all falls
<BR>
down.   So, Gene, I think that the &quot;old&quot; paradigm is still as true as ever:
<BR>
land has intrinsic value, stocks do not, and we should give careful
<BR>
consideration to what we are really investing in when we buy either.&quot;
