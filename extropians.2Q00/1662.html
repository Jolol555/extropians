<P><EM>    &gt; and prices were far below profitable levels for many if not most farmers
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;(i.e. production exceeded demand).
</EM><BR>
<P>That's just natures way of telling farmers that you're making too much of something,
<BR>
if you ignore natures advice you go broke, as well you should.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;And how quickly do you think it would take for them [oil workers] to go into another
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;line of work?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know. Perhaps it could happen quickly, or perhaps it would take a long time to teach
<BR>
them how to make Mr. Fusion machines, if so the fusion industry would be handicapped by
<BR>
a labor shortage and the demise of the oil business would be delayed.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Take a look at Russia right now. Its been 10 years since their defense industry
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;collapsed  (about 50% of their entire economy)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From an economic viewpoint defense is a drain not a fundamental source of wealth,
</EM><BR>
it's like paying millions of people to build pyramids or dig holes and then fill them up again.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;and the place is still a shithole.
</EM><BR>
<P>Russia was always a shithole.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Any new industry is not going to be burdened, and will not want to be burdened by
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;unionized employees.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe, but most &quot;new economy&quot; companies are not unionized and their employees
<BR>
don't seem to be suffering much. But I don't want to talk about unions, it's just too dull.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;They will automate as much of their manufacturing as  possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you're saying that eventually machines will be able to do everything better than
<BR>
human beings then I agree, but is that really your point, we were after all talking about
<BR>
1929.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Would you have invested in CISCO telephone wire routers if you knew that
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;another technology was 12 months down the road that would give you 100x
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the capability for the exact same price?
</EM><BR>
<P>In the real world the company is still managing to find plenty of customers, I grant you that the
<BR>
technology isn't improving by a factor of a hundred every year, the amount of information
<BR>
CISCO can send down a line is only doubling every 9 months but the end is not in sight.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;I noticed you deleted my explaination for why they'd be screwed no matter how much
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;they wanted to and were capable of building an aircar.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is my habit to delete as much irrelevant quoted material as I possibly can, unlike certain
<BR>
people I could name.
