<EM>&gt;  &gt; Killing a sentient being, whether an identical twin, an exact replica of you

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An exact replica of you (you do realize what that means, don't you?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is you. This means, there are two instances of you, both being in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exact the same state. As long as they don't bifurcate, I don't see why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can't delete one of them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The only objectionable point here is that by doing so, you devoid one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the clones from a future possibility of bifurcation, and subsequent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; divergence, and hence from becoming an individual being.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Terminating a fully synched self clone is imo less than a murder. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is very much like an abortion, because it prevents a potential human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being from being created. Current society is quite divided on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ethics of the matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really Gene. Abortion happens before birth. Two live independent
<BR>
identical individuals can be best approximated by two infant twins.
<BR>
Killing one of them is most definitely not ok by anyone's stretch of the
<BR>
imagination, as I've even gotten John to concede that point. Bifurcation
<BR>
occurs almost instantly after the point of duplication and separation.
<BR>
<P>Now, if we are dealing with upload copies, that is something entirely
<BR>
different, but only if the copies are not activated, or if the two
<BR>
willingly merge back into one to preserve the memory, the experience of
<BR>
each individual. See Charles Sheffield's _Tomorrow and Tomorrow_.
