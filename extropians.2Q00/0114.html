<EM>&gt; I'm not surprised that the cradle to grave nanny state is on the forefront of

<EM>&gt; this. I'm also not surprised that the areas in the US that are jumping on the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; police forces, and general social misery and oppression.

Ahem. Taxation in the UK is roughly on a par with the USA -- it's the
<BR>
lowest tax zone in Europe, and one of the lowest tax regimes in the
<BR>
developed world. Welfare bureaucracy is minimal, too. This is the country
<BR>
where an allegedly left-wing government is privatising the air traffic
<BR>
control system and the post office, and has privatised most of the
<BR>
infrastructure items that are handled by local government in the USA.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All this incomplete coverage will do is cause more criminals to commit crimes in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; areas that ARENT under coverage. The crime rate in more rural areas will go up,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people will get whacked out on the moors, etc. You'll see a lot of spouses dying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in 'accidents' during camping trips. Boating 'accidents' will rise, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criminals will get more circumspect about cleaning up crime scenes.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
It's happened, but not the way you suggest. The first areas to get protected
<BR>
were central shopping/business areas and middle class suburbs. This pushed
<BR>
crime out into low-income estates. (There simply isn't enough rural area
<BR>
for people to get lost/whacked in -- or a high enough murder rate for the
<BR>
phenomenon to be visible. When I said urbanized, I _meant_ urbanized: 98% of
<BR>
the population lives in towns/cities, the housing density is comparable
<BR>
to Japan.)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; So what you are saying is that Heathrow is a good place to test my Mr. Mike's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Big Brother Zapper...oh, that could be fun....
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Believe me, I've thought about it!
<BR>
<P>Logical countermeasures:
<BR>
<P>1. Make BBZ's illegal, of course.
<BR>
<P>2. Switch from video to film cameras. Microtechnology will probably make this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible; use *really tiny* film reels, flying insects to collect the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cameras and digest/develop/transcieve the film when nobody is around. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This isn't real-time surveillance, however.)
<BR>
<P>3. Fibre optics.
<BR>
<P>4. Neural network detection of suspicious behaviour -- lurking with intent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to zap a camera _will_ get you highlighted and questioned by the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;police. (This latter is currently in active development by, for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example, London Underground, who want to be able to spot trouble on tube
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;train platforms -- like disturbances, bombs, pick-pockets, or potential
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suicide risks.)
