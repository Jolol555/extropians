<P>
Those Senior Associates at the Foresight Institute have all the fun!!!  I 
<BR>
miss all the cool stuff by being poor and living in Alaska!  I want to go!  
<BR>
I hope those of you who attend (like Eliezer) can give us a report of how it 
<BR>
went.
<BR>
<P>best wishes,
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>&quot;Engines of Creation 2000: Confronting Singularity&quot;
<BR>
<P>Spring 2000 Senior Associate Gathering
<BR>
May 19-21, 2000
<BR>
Palo Alto, California
<BR>
<P>Register by May 1 to save $100
<BR>
<P>See who's coming at:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/SrAssoc/spring2000">http://www.foresight.org/SrAssoc/spring2000</A>
<BR>
including Eric Drexler, Bill Joy, Marvin Minsky, Tim O'Reilly, Eric Raymond
<BR>
<P>Foresight's Annual Brainstorming-Planning-Actionfest &amp; NanoSchmoozathon
<BR>
<P>The 21st century: every day in every way, weirder and weirder. Not to worry 
<BR>
-- there's still time to tweak this early phase of the &quot;run-up to 
<BR>
Singularity&quot;. At this event we'll be exploring what can be known about the 
<BR>
world we're being pushed into-closer every second-and how we can influence 
<BR>
the outcome by influencing initial conditions. Our tools? Memes-infectious 
<BR>
ideas-which we create and launch, with excellent success to date. Come help 
<BR>
improve the next batch, and help design open-source software to refine and 
<BR>
spread them.
<BR>
<P>We'll be aiming to influence:
<BR>
<P>*  who gets nanotechnology first -- public or private, secret or open, in 
<BR>
which country?
<BR>
*  intellectual property in nanotechnology -- tightly held or widely  
<BR>
available?
<BR>
*  ownership of space resources (i.e. most of the universe) --
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government or private? winner take all, or distributed?
<BR>
*  which entities will have &quot;human rights&quot;?
<BR>
*  openness vs. privacy -- can we find a balance that works?
<BR>
*  encrypted private currencies -- can government panic be headed off?
<BR>
*  open source -- can we spread the model beyond software?
<BR>
*  can nanotech warfare be prevented?
<BR>
<P>Join Foresight and our special guests as we picture our preferred future,  
<BR>
design a pathway there, and implement using all the tools available.  When 
<BR>
you leave you'll have the clearest picture possible of what's on the 
<BR>
horizon, who's stepping up to the challenges in each area, and what your 
<BR>
options are for optimizing how nanotechnology and other powerful 
<BR>
technologies play out.
<BR>
<P>Find this all a little overwhelming? Not for us as a group. While it might 
<BR>
feel intimidating to sit alone, watching as this future comes charging at 
<BR>
us, we've found that jumping in and trying to tweak things for the better is 
<BR>
great fun.
<BR>
<P>Most conferences have &quot;talking heads&quot;, with a little Q&amp;A discussion if 
<BR>
you're lucky. Not this time: instead, launch yourself into the topics of 
<BR>
your choice in workshop-style sessions of 10, 25, or 80 participants. 
<BR>
Explore the edges of what we know today and can reasonably project over the 
<BR>
coming decades:
<BR>
<P>*  Figure out which scenarios are preferred, and how to get there by
<BR>
influencing the process now: still early on.
<BR>
*  Design an action plan based on the skills and resources available to us - 
<BR>
start a company, write  a constitution...whatever it takes.
<BR>
*  See how all this affects you personally - your career, your investments 
<BR>
of time and funds, your health and life expectancy, your family.
<BR>
<P>Think we've missed a major issue? No problem - add a session on that topic. 
<BR>
Your group's output gets folded in as input to the next stage of the 
<BR>
process, equal in priority to output from pre-scheduled groups.
<BR>
<P>How the process works:
<BR>
1. Select your personal pathway through parallel workshop-style sessions
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taking on the topics you're most interested in, from nanotechnology  to 
<BR>
AI to surveillance.
<BR>
<P>2. Explore widely, then focus down, and finally drive for consensus on these 
<BR>
tough, exciting issues. Produce a result, your &quot;product&quot;: a recommendation, 
<BR>
a warning, an estimate, a graphic, an unresolved controversy, or whatever 
<BR>
your group feels needs to be communicated on this issue. A condensed 
<BR>
example: &quot;Public surveillance data must be kept confidential except under 
<BR>
court order&quot; or &quot;Public surveillance data must be made publicly available&quot;.
<BR>
<P>3. Your results are fed into the next round, where they're used to tackle 
<BR>
the next stage of problem.
<BR>
<P>4. By Sunday night, we'll have an action plan with specific goals, dates, 
<BR>
and commitments. Work continues online throughout the year to implement - 
<BR>
then in spring 2001, we &quot;course-correct&quot;, folding in new reality checks, new 
<BR>
resources, new ideas, new skills from new people. It's an ongoing adventure, 
<BR>
running right up to Singularity itself. Check out the &quot;Engines of Creation 
<BR>
2000&quot; webpages for more detail: <A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/engines/index.html">http://www.foresight.org/engines/index.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Why come to this event: Because it's the year 2000 and sure enough, just as 
<BR>
we expected, things are getting technologically weird.
<BR>
<P>Because even though we're in the &quot;run-up to Singularity&quot;, there are
<BR>
things we can do now to help ourselves, our organizations, our fellow homo 
<BR>
sapiens, and our (current) biosphere to survive and prosper through the 
<BR>
bizarre times to come.
<BR>
<P>Because this meeting is the Burning Man of ideas on our technological 
<BR>
future. It's the TED of 2020, held today. If the ideas described here 
<BR>
intrigue you, there is no better place in the world to explore their 
<BR>
interactions, with help and moral support from others who share your 
<BR>
interests.
<BR>
<P>Because you'll meet some of the folks implementing these goals, and maybe 
<BR>
get invited to join them. Ya gotta meet 'em before they can offer you that 
<BR>
dream job in nanotechnology R&amp;D-this has already happened to a few of us.
<BR>
<P>Because it's great fun, and we deserve a treat.
