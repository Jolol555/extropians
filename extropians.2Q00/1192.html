&quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; says:
<BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As it happens, this particular topic has been rather well researched. Mike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is exaggerating a bit, but it is certainly true that in the first half of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the 20th century American high schools taught many subjects that are now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; considered advanced college fare. My favorite example is the fact that the
</EM><BR>
....
<BR>
<EM>&gt; few well worn phrases. I just received a message from a girl on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; newsgroup who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a senior in college and is so happy she came out in the top of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; her class in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; linear algebra...
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>And your point is?  
<BR>
<P>Linear algebra is not simple algebra.  It's typically taught after
<BR>
calculus, around the same time as the study of ordinary differential
<BR>
equations, but before more advanced topics such as modern algebra,
<BR>
real and complex analysis, number theory, partial differential
<BR>
equations, topology, and so on.  Glancing back at the Springer-Verlag
<BR>
volume &quot;Linear Algebra&quot;, by Klaus Janich, from their &quot;Undergraduate
<BR>
Texts in Mathematics&quot;, I see that they describe the study of linear
<BR>
algebra as concerning sets, maps, groups, vector spaces, including
<BR>
complex and Euclidean spaces, bases, matrices and their
<BR>
classification, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, endomorphism and the
<BR>
characteristic polynomial.  This is not the stuff one typically covers
<BR>
in high school algebra, but rather an advanced application of the type
<BR>
of tools that such courses provide to topics that extend beyond the
<BR>
purview of a basic algebra class.  While a very well prepared student
<BR>
-- say, someone with a perfect calculus advanced placement score --
<BR>
studying math for a BA at a reasonable college in the U.S. would
<BR>
typically encounter linear algebra in the first or second year of
<BR>
study, as I did back in 1987, a person who had only had a good high
<BR>
school mathematics education and who wished to study math as a
<BR>
supplementary topic might well wait another year or two for ODE or
<BR>
Linear Algebra.  This is in no way a sign of a deficiency in high
<BR>
school or higher education standards.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The year I graduated from high school, 1986, NH had the highest average SAT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scores in the nation, while it had spent the least per capita on education fo
</EM><BR>
r
<BR>
<EM>&gt; many years, and is still one of the five lowest funding states...  Our state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Supreme Court is, at the moment, being dismembered by the Governor, the AG, a
</EM><BR>
nd
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the legislature (ostensibly for other reasons, but we all know the real reaso
</EM><BR>
n)
<BR>
<EM>&gt; all because the good 'ol boys couldn't seem to make the connection that money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't equal quality education, despite our history.
</EM><BR>
<P>The United States Senator from New York Daniel Patrick Moynihan
<BR>
famously observed some years back that he had learned from the Federal
<BR>
government's own statistics people upon comissioning a review that the
<BR>
distance from a state capital to Canada had several times the
<BR>
statistical correlation with results on standardized tests in that
<BR>
state than did the amount of money spent per pupil.  (Specifically,
<BR>
the closer to Canada, the better the scores.)  He joked that the thing
<BR>
to do was move the state capitals to the northern border of each
<BR>
state.  
<BR>
<P>Clearly many other factors are at work.
<BR>
<P>All the best!
