<EM>&gt; Why more productive?  Well this one is explainable with a short analogy:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who would you rather have, 100 Bill Gateses or 100 Mother Theresas?
</EM><BR>
<P>Every Mother Theresa after the first (at any point, the &quot;marginal&quot; mother
<BR>
Theresa) adds something (even if only a little) to society; a net benefit.
<BR>
Perhaps at some extreme adding extra Mother Theresas becomes a cost. What
<BR>
does a society made excludively of Mother Theresas do, there being no one to
<BR>
save? However, one might safely assume that 100 is a lower quantity than
<BR>
that necessary to fall to the break-even point.
<BR>
<P>We can say that one Bill Gates, also, is a net benefit, for argument's sake.
<BR>
Although you can't be sure; the benefit of Bill Gates is in what he has
<BR>
built; the cost in what he has destroyed.
<BR>
<P>After the first Bill, however, you end up in a blood bath. If anyone
<BR>
subscribes to the &quot;there can only be one&quot; philosophy of existence, it is
<BR>
Bill. So marginal Bills just add to the general multi-sided chaos &amp;
<BR>
destruction; a net cost.
<BR>
<P>Thus, the rational choice would be 100 Mother Theresas.
<BR>
<P>For my money, I'd go for 100 Doug Hofstaders; now that would be useful. If
<BR>
it was the fight pit situation, however, maybe Hans Moravec would be a
<BR>
better choice, because 100 Moravecs could build some meaty BattleMechs and
<BR>
slaughter all comers.
<BR>
<P>Emlyn
<BR>
(I would choose myself, but I'd only be useful if there were infinite
<BR>
copies, and even then that doesn't include the cost of the typewriters)
