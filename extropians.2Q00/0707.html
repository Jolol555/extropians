Voyages across the Universe have come light years closer 
<BR>
<P><P>FASTEN your seatbelts and hold on tight--intergalactic space travel is back 
<BR>
on the agenda. Sceptics who dismiss the idea of faster-than-light travel 
<BR>
through &quot;wormholes&quot; in space may have to think again, because new 
<BR>
calculations based on Einstein's general theory of relativity suggest that 
<BR>
wormholes large and stable enough to allow intergalactic travel really can 
<BR>
exist. 
<BR>
<P>The possibility that the cosmos is peppered with short cuts through space and 
<BR>
time has intrigued people ever since 1915 when German theorist Ludwig Flamm 
<BR>
found hints of their existence in Einstein's equations. While attempts to 
<BR>
unify the fundamental forces of nature suggest that tiny quantum wormholes 
<BR>
may exist, most experts suspect that some fundamental law of physics prevents 
<BR>
the formation of large wormholes--not least because these would theoretically 
<BR>
allow time travellers to go back in time and, say, prevent their own birth by 
<BR>
accidentally killing one of their parents. 
<BR>
<P>Now a Russian theorist has found a new type of wormhole that is compatible 
<BR>
with the known laws of physics, yet can be as big and stable as you like. 
<BR>
According to Sergei Krasnikov, a relativity expert at the Pulkovo Observatory 
<BR>
in St Petersburg, the standard arguments against large wormholes assume that 
<BR>
they all have the same basic shape, and need to be crammed with &quot;exotic 
<BR>
matter&quot; to keep them open (New Scientist, 6 September 1997, p 49). 
<BR>
<P>Such exotic matter has never been seen, but theory suggests it can be created 
<BR>
literally out of nothing when space and time are curved in the right way. 
<BR>
What Krasnikov has found is a new type of wormhole that can create its own 
<BR>
supply of exotic matter--and in sufficient quantities to make it big enough 
<BR>
and keep it open long enough for people to use. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;This new wormhole, like every other, needs exotic matter for it to form, and 
<BR>
like some others can produce it by itself,&quot; Krasnikov told New Scientist. 
<BR>
&quot;What's new is that this wormhole actually generates enough to make it 
<BR>
arbitrarily large.&quot; Other theorists admit to being intrigued by the new work, 
<BR>
but remain cautious. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's worth taking seriously,&quot; says Ian Moss, a relativity expert at the 
<BR>
University of Newcastle upon Tyne. &quot;The main worry is that it could fall down 
<BR>
on some technical detail.&quot; Paul Davies of Imperial College, London, adds that 
<BR>
proving something is theoretically possible does not prove it actually 
<BR>
exists: &quot;My feeling is that the matter is still open,&quot; he says. 
<BR>
<P>Krasnikov accepts that testing his claims by building a wormhole is far 
<BR>
beyond present technology. Even so, such wormholes may have been left over 
<BR>
from the big bang, he says--and finding one would have a dramatic effect on 
<BR>
interstellar travel: &quot;If there is a wormhole connecting the vicinities of the 
<BR>
Earth and the star Vega, one can take a short cut by flying through it.&quot;
