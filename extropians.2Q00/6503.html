<P><EM>&gt; Can we all agree, though, that in general, people are willing to work harder

<EM>&gt; if their material rewards are directly proportional to the work done?  And

<EM>&gt; that they're willing to spend more time, thought, and money on research if

<EM>&gt; they stand a chance of getting a patent if and when they come up with

<P>No.
<BR>
<P>Open source programmers work for no material reward, receiving pride in their
<BR>
work and community esteem instead.  Research scientists work quite hard for
<BR>
the love of knowledge and discovery, and the credit of discovery, not for high
<BR>
monetary profit.  (The Nobel carries money with it, but that's a bonus more
<BR>
than a direct goal.)  Politicians get paid well, but not _that_ well; varying
<BR>
mixtures of public service and desire for power drive them.  (Actually, at low
<BR>
levels I can see public office as a cushy job.  But not the Presidency.)
<BR>
<P>Certainly there is quite often a correlation between work and reward.  But
<BR>
'directly proportional' is a strong claim, and at any rate there are
<BR>
significant spheres of people having other motivation.
<BR>
<P>Public activism being another such.  Betcha Max More isn't following the
<BR>
shortest path to riches in running ExI.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I love the way such topics (from a non-US perspective) go instantly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hysterical with fear &amp; loathing. Might do many people on the list some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; good to spend some time in other First World nations where we do things
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with Damien, but note this cuts many way.  US economic conservatives
<BR>
can stand seeing countries with more active public sectors[1] and functioning.
<BR>
US social conservatives can stand seeing countries with lower ages of consent,
<BR>
legal prostitution, and more sex than corpses in their movies[2].  Europeans
<BR>
and US urban left-wingers can stand seeing that many parts of the US have lots
<BR>
of guns without being free-fire zones.
<BR>
<P>[1] On rec.arts.sf.written there's a New Zealander who keeps saying NZ is the
<BR>
most free market country on the earth, as of 1989.  Seems odd, given their
<BR>
national health care system, whatever it is, exactly.  But they are much
<BR>
more consistently free trade than protectionist bastions such as the United
<BR>
States, and supposedly have much less in the way of industry subsidies.
<BR>
Basically it sounds like a very free market with a very fine social safety net
<BR>
underneath it.  As opposed to the US and Europe, which are varying mixes of
<BR>
selective tariffs, direct subsidies, random regulations, and safety nets with
<BR>
holes (at least in the US case.)
<BR>
<P>Some New Zealanders and Dutchmen on rasfw have also been describing their
<BR>
banking systems, which make ours sound rather primitive.
<BR>
<P>[2] Actually, I've read an essay by William Bennett wherein he acknowledged
<BR>
the big moral differences between the US and Europe and attributed this to
<BR>
Europe being corrupt and decadent, and even claimed many Europeans secretly
<BR>
admired our stricter morality.  But perhaps less arrogant Americans would stop
<BR>
and think a bit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Most taxes and regulations DO end up impacting the poor more than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wealthy.  Listen, one reasons I stopped practicing tax law (I confess, it
</EM><BR>
<P>Not the estate tax we want to repeal!
