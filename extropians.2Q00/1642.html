<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Now, would you like to explain exactly how your suggestion would result
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; in a successful resolution of the Irish problem? If you can convince us,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; then I suggest you will not find the Prime Minister and the Taioseach
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; uninterested. (They -- and their predecessors -- have been looking for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; solution for the past three decades, at great personal risk.) If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; can't suggest a solution, may I submit that the smart thing to do would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; be in future to do your research _before_ you open your mouth in public?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; The unfortunate problem, Charlie, is that the northern group looks upon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; itself as 'english', not 'irish', so the solution is to get ALL of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 'english' out of Ireland.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; To paraphrase Longshanks:&quot;The problem with Ireland is that its full of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Englishmen.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Heh. I had to laugh when I read this. But, nice guy that I am, instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slagging off your ignorance, I'm going to let you know what the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situation is.
</EM><BR>
<P>Rob, I'm quite familiar with the situation. Don't think for a minute that I think
<BR>
the IRA or the pIRA should be considered legitimate politicians. They are hardly
<BR>
'republican' (unless you are talking about People's Republics). However the level
<BR>
to which you and others demonize them would hardly make an IRA member very
<BR>
trusting that you didn't have it in for him, because he 'knows' that what you say
<BR>
about him isn't true, so far as he is concerned. I've found that this is a
<BR>
typical british argument while sipping their tea, &quot;:oh, we're the civilized ones,
<BR>
THEY are just utter barbarians...&quot; that kind of thing. Condescension and
<BR>
alternately, vilification, gets you nowhere.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  THERE IS NO GROUP THAT WANTS NI TO JOIN EIRE, this will never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happen, it is not the issue.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, until recently it was written into the Eire constitution, and its part
<BR>
of the IRA and Sinn Fein 'platform', that rejoining Eire was the ultimate goal,
<BR>
so I don't understand what you are basing this claim on.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's a juvenile flag-grab, that's all. On top
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of all the bombings is a regime of &quot;kneecapping&quot; (blasting the unfortunate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; victims kneecaps off from the back of the knee - crippling for life), which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the standard punishment for anti-republican activities. The other group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are the &quot;loyalists&quot;. They are strangely apprehensive of removing the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; British government and replacing it with a bunch of bomb crazy kneecapping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arbitrarily power hungry lunatics (emotive yes, but undeniably true).
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure the South Africans felt the same way about the ANC at some point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; THIS is the crux of the problem. The fact that the populace of NI are split.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The British government wants nothing more than to wash it's hands of NI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forever after all the troubles, but they can't just hand the country over to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the terrorists, leaving the other half of the populace under the control of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nutters against their will. They all are, after all British citizens, and
</EM><BR>
<P>Great evacuate them, if they are British. If they are Irish, let them stay.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the government absolutely cannot condemn it's citizens to such a fate just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because some juvenile megalomanic vermin threaten to blow some people up.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fine way to develop trust Rob. Fine fine strategy. Let me give you a lesson on
<BR>
terrorism: Terrorists do what they do for very rational, very logical reasons.
<BR>
What they do may be horrific, but everything they do is always for very good
<BR>
reasons, from their point of view. The point of terrorism is to get the other
<BR>
side to appreciate that the oppressed may really have good reasons, by giving
<BR>
them a concentrated dose of their own medicine. The fact you keep ranting on in
<BR>
such virulent terms shows me that YOU haven't learned this lesson yet. If most
<BR>
british are like you, I predict that the violence will continue on for quite a
<BR>
while more....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is no &quot;Irish&quot; problem in NI, and there is no &quot;English&quot; problem in NI,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's entirely an NI problem. The leaders of the republicans see an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opportunity to rule, and the followers are either blindly following a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movement for the opportunities for violence, or they're so idiotic that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changing the colour of a flag is deemed more important than thousands upon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousands of innocent peoples' lives.
</EM><BR>
<P>Considering that the level of violence in even the worst areas of NI is nowhere
<BR>
near the levels of violence in peaceful Boston, MA, you can hardly expect me to
<BR>
agree with you...sounds to me like a drama queen at work...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It really doesn't help the situation to have the damned Americans funding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the bastard IRA under the delusion that they represent a native struggle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against British oppression, which is exactly what the republicans want us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all to believe. Simply not true. I live in England, and I can tell you that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the government are if anything, a bit wet - certainly anything but an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oppressive regime.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its always easier to get away with oppression when nobody thinks that you are
<BR>
really capable of it. Thats why nobody beleives that there is more domestic
<BR>
violence by women against men than the other way around, even though its true
<BR>
(the very study that womens groups tout to show violence against women actually
<BR>
shows more violence by women, but they never mention this fact).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The loyalists know that their current government is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vastly superior to any terrorist organisation, and you can see this in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact that loyalists - protestants and republicans - catholics no longer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correlate as they once did. Everyone is sick to the back teeth of this IRA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shit, and a great many including myself would have liked to have seen wider
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use of the 80's &quot;shoot to kill&quot; policy of the SAS.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which just indicates the the propaganda may be working, and the british have been
<BR>
able to avoid any fuckups for a sufficient amount of time. The SAS threw in the
<BR>
towel. They concluded there were at best 300 active IRA people committing most if
<BR>
not all violent acts, and they couldn't take them down. With one of the tightest
<BR>
gun control laws in the world, the SAS couldn't outgun the IRA. With one of the
<BR>
most absolute policies abdicating the human rights of the accused (and the Laws
<BR>
of War for that matter, depending on which way you want to take the argument),
<BR>
they couldn't hunt down and erase even a fraction of the enemy.
<BR>
<P>If you are so sick to the back of the teeth about it, then quit.
