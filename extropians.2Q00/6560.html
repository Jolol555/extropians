<P><EM>&gt; I'm not sure what you're saying - are migrants incapable of improving 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves in the way you or I have? Do you not see this as condescending? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Improve myself?  I'm a lazy, lucky, First World kid.  Improvement has been
<BR>
poured down my throat from birth.  Tons of books in the house, intellectual
<BR>
parents, the genes (what else?) able to bootstrap from that environment and
<BR>
teach myself to read before I was 3, piano lessons, gifted classes and
<BR>
fast-paced programs in the public schools, magnet high school, access to
<BR>
computers and programming classes and zero difficulty in visualizing a
<BR>
computer's operation 
<BR>
<P>(I TA'ed one such class; the students clearly varied from completely not
<BR>
needing me to being completely clue-proof.  And it looked like they were
<BR>
trying, not that we were experienced teachers or anything)
<BR>
<P>followed by Caltech and Silicon Valley, with jobs and high salaries dropping
<BR>
into my lap.
<BR>
<P>Vs. someone born in a Third World village, no running water or modern
<BR>
medicine, minimal books or electricity, not surrounded by a literate and
<BR>
industrial society so that the values of such can seep into their soul through
<BR>
osmosis... yet they move to a foreign country, without money or the language
<BR>
(but probably with knowing previous migrants in the area), working as long or
<BR>
longer hours than the most dedicated IPO hunter, at more physically taxing and
<BR>
mind-numbing work.
<BR>
<P>Improve themselves?  Far more so than I have.  But from so far behind... their
<BR>
children might catch up, some of them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There's a catch-22 - is it possible for someone to be implicitly superior to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone else, via genetics or whatever? I believe that, no it is not. In rare 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cases, such as mental retardation, someone is at a natural disadvantage, but 
</EM><BR>
<P>You see the human brain as binary?  Either retarded, or infinitely plastic and
<BR>
trainable?  All normal brains are alike?  A gradation of mental abilities
<BR>
doesn't seem more likely, especially after the vicissitudes of education?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; else, then you would expect and want it to be reflected in differences in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; income.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Sure.  But that doesn't mean being blind to the misery of others.
<BR>
<P>How'd we start this, anyway?  Oh, right: Bonnie said people work harder in
<BR>
proportion to financial reward, and Damien B. pointed out that the migrants
<BR>
are working harder for less ultimate reward than, say, me.  And they're
<BR>
grateful for the opportunity, compared to back home.
<BR>
<P>Hell.  People like me don't even 'work', ideally.  Yeah, we want money for
<BR>
creature comforts and toys.  But after that work should be intellectual play,
<BR>
or at least a mixture of that and hired labor for someone else.
<BR>
<P>And Bill Gates is driven, probably.  He's talking about giving most of his
<BR>
money to charity when he dies, not to his kids, or on transhumanist causes or
<BR>
anything.  I doubt he planned to work hard so that he could set up a vaccine
<BR>
or ghetto education fund.  He was a good agressive CEO, and now he literally
<BR>
has more money than he knows what to do with.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; immigrants, they couldn't anyone. Solution: slowly increase immigration 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quotas until they exceed the actual amount of immigration, then do away with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them, while slowly lowering the minimum wage until it is zero.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wonder what the unrestricted rate of immigration would be.  Possibly we
<BR>
could extrpolate from 19th century rates, if I knew them.  But travel is so
<BR>
much easier, and there are so many more people out there...
