<EM>&gt; &gt;a) there is no 'thrill' or 'rush' from packing heat. Anyone who does so for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;purpose or to get the chance to use it on somebody shouldn't be carrying,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;should really reexamine why they are carrying. This is the typical response
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the hoplophobes, that people who carry are a bunch of bloodthirsty sadists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that wanna go out and kick ass. This couldn't be further from the truth. To
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a carry permit, you have to be one of the more squeaky clean and non-violent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;people in your society. When I applied for my permit, the cops called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;around to&gt;at least half a dozen people who knew me (not people I had given as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;references,&gt;as, according to the police chief, &quot;Those people are gonna say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nice things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about&gt;you.&quot;) and asked questions like 'is he a violent person?', 'has he ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;been&gt;mean to animals?', etc...which led to some interesting phone calls to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;later&gt;in the week....they also did a 50 state and a federal background check
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;any&gt;criminal record (even though state law says its not required).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are you kidding me?  This is supposed to convince me that people who carry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guns are the most &quot;squeaky clean and non-violent people&quot; in society?  That,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as you like to say, is rich!
</EM><BR>
<P>Why is that?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clue:  the cops who killed Amadou Diallo and the cops who sodomized Abner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Louima and the cops in LA's Rampart Precinct who apparently routinely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; framed, beat and shot innocent people *all* passed the same sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; background test you're talking about.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, policemen have a far higher incidence of juvinile delinquency than
<BR>
other parts of the population. Police Chiefs have been known to expunge the past
<BR>
juvinile and adult criminal records of police candidates in order to fill the
<BR>
force (though usually that occurs when the department has to fill an affirmative
<BR>
action quota). They have a higher incidence of domestic violence than the
<BR>
regular population, nor do police have to go through a NICS Instacheck
<BR>
background check when they purchase a gun, nor do they get a background check
<BR>
when they buy a class III automatic weapon. As far as the police (pigs) are
<BR>
concerned, some are indeed 'more equal than others'.
