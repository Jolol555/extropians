<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20You%20may%20not%20believe%20in%20God%20but%20She%20still%20believes%20in%20you,%20most%20of%20the%20time&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGOENNFFAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem arises with assumption of the One True Religion which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does not exist. Atheism, on the other hand, has the equally silly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claim that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since none of them is the One True Religion, then none of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are True.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've seen Atheism practiced with the same intolerant zeal as Christianity or
<BR>
Scientology.  But the Atheists aren't trying to save souls or to clear
<BR>
engrams.  What, then, would their motive be?
