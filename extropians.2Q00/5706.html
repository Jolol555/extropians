<EM>&gt; &gt; I personally live in one of the most dangerous cities in Europe: 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Stockholm.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You think it is strange? Well, Stockholm has in all its recorded history
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; been a violent city. For instance, today Los Angeles has a murder rate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; about 10.8 murders on every 100 000 inhabitants, Stockholm has 10.2!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Very interesting.
</EM><BR>
<P>Rather appalling numbers I would say.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Stockholm is the only metropolitan area in Sweden though, so the average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; crime rate is comparatively low. The violence in Swedish society is also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; very much concentrated on specific segments of society. Most often those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; segments that don't receive much media coverage. &quot;Bum A and Bum B met at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A's ratty apartement and started drinking, then Bum B killed Bum A in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; drunken stupor&quot;, is the average Swedish murder, nothing sassy to write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; about. But the violence is very much present in Stockholm, and its 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; outside the usual segments of society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thats how much crime is here as well, only the media spins the story based 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the circumstances. If Bum A was a woman and Bum B was a man, its a case of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'domestic violence' or 'stalking'. If Bum A is black and bum B is white, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'racist hate crime killing', while if it were the other way around, it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'gang violence'. If the ratty apartment were near a school campus and both 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bums
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were students, it would be a 'school shooting'. If Bum B was working for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bum A,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it would be a 'crazed worker going postal' incident, and if the 'apartment' 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the back of Bum A's van, then its 'murder on the highways'.
</EM><BR>
<P>Often these labels are stuck to the crimes by the medias to pump up an 
<BR>
otherwise &quot;uninteresting&quot; story. And unfortunately this is often 
<BR>
contributing to an atmosphere of fear, even if it is unjustified. The 
<BR>
harsher laws can be passed, affect the whole society while Joe Sixpack 
<BR>
whines about &quot;society being lax on criminals&quot; while HIS rights go down the 
<BR>
drain too.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Europe often points fingers at the US for its crime rate, while 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conveniently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; forgetting its often higher (or at least comparable) crime rates. The US 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; often more heterogenous that the European countries (that have been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;heavily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; centralized) so comparisions between European countries and the US are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not that good.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thank you Waldemar for the honest commentary.
</EM><BR>
<P>In a transhumanist criminological spirit (that's a new one, transhumanist 
<BR>
criminology) I think its is important to show that crime isn't that all 
<BR>
encompassing danger it is often pointed out to be. Scared people seldom 
<BR>
think about improving themselves, just protecting themselves. An open 
<BR>
society cannot survive long if its citizens are terrified.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Waldemar
