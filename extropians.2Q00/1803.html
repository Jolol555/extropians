<P>
I believe I had commented previously in the list on the possible
<BR>
presence of a &quot;Brown dwarf desert&quot; between lower mass brown
<BR>
dwarfs and heavier planets.
<BR>
<P>This situation is clarified on &quot;The Discovery of Brown Dwarfs&quot;
<BR>
by Gibor Basri in the April Scientific American.
<BR>
&nbsp;URL: <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/2000/0400issue/0400basri.html">http://www.sciam.com/2000/0400issue/0400basri.html</A>
<BR>
<P>There is a paucity of brown dwarfs in the studies searching
<BR>
solar mass stars for planets that have lead to the discovery of many
<BR>
putative super-Jovian massed planets.  This is apparently because the
<BR>
typical range of masses between binary stars seems to be about an order
<BR>
of magnitude.  Stars of 0.1 solar mass are going to be red dwarfs
<BR>
and not brown dwarfs.  Brown dwarfs are being found as binary companions
<BR>
of lower mass stars (e.g. red dwarfs).  This is presumably because the
<BR>
mass of the stars depends on the gas cloud density and the difficulty in
<BR>
setting up cloud conditions that would lead to binaries where
<BR>
one star is very large and its partner is very small.  Brown
<BR>
dwarfs are also being found as single stars, though it is not
<BR>
clear whether these may be due to low gas cloud densities or
<BR>
slingshot events similar to those that lead to rogue planet formation.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly the quantities of stars and brown dwarfs in clouds
<BR>
like the Pleiades are similar, and if extrapolated to the galaxy
<BR>
would argue for the presence of 100 billion brown dwarfs.
<BR>
<P>Unless star lifting to the point of turning off thermonuclear fusion
<BR>
is easy, there should be an argument that SIs colonize and restructure
<BR>
brown dwarfs before they colonize and restructure red dwarfs.  So as
<BR>
the population surveys (DENIS, 2MASS, Sloan DSS, etc.) come in if
<BR>
there is a deviation in the estimates of the Initial Mass Function
<BR>
(star formation theory) and the observed red dwarf/brown dwarf
<BR>
abundances, that would argue that SIs are siphoning off the brown
<BR>
dwarf population.
<BR>
<P>So, the strategic development of galaxies may be:
<BR>
&nbsp;(a) Colonize the brown dwarfs because they aren't good for much else.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(They actually represent galactic hazards in the long term because
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a lesser extent than rogue planets, it is difficult to see them
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approaching at a distance).  To minimize long term collision avoidance
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;costs, you want to turn them into something useful and put that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;material into well-defined, stable galactic orbits.  The development
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of brown dwarfs may allow better energy utilization since the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nuclear fuel can be burned at a controlled rate (in thermonuclear
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reactors), dictated by computational requirements, rather
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than an uncontrolled rate dictated by the mass of the star.
<BR>
&nbsp;(b)  Let the stars burn away, since they constitute efficient breeder
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reactors for heavy metals (C, Ti, W, etc.) that you need for specific
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;construction purposes.
<BR>
<P>The failure to colonize the galaxy completely, argues that
<BR>
&nbsp;(a) intelligent technological life is very difficult; and/or
<BR>
&nbsp;(b) diversity desirability or morality function(s) come into play; and/or
<BR>
&nbsp;(c) the diminishing computational returns of widely distributed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computronium supporting advanced &quot;civilizations&quot; make endless
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expansion pointless.
<BR>
<P>Its probably worth noting that it is going to take dozens of brown
<BR>
dwarfs to construct objects of the masses observed in the gravitational
<BR>
microlensing results (~0.3-0.5 M_sun), so the assembly of these
<BR>
objects may require many millions of years if you want to minimize
<BR>
the energy/mass wasting orbital delta-V adjustments.
<BR>
