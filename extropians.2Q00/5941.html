<EM>&gt; When I first thought about it, I kept thinking, indeed, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charge amounts to Jewish paranoia, but I no longer think that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It has at least three components. 1. Anti-Semitism is the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explanation for the irrationality of the eternally recurring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumcision discussions (in these discussions, medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence, as I've assessed it, is not adduced rationally). 2.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Things Jewish have more than once been referred to as funny or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; odd or something (though of course not &quot;evil,&quot; or &quot;sucking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shit&quot;). At least twice, for example, a Jewish name was referred
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to as funny or odd or something along these lines (a reference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to Ayn Rand's birth name, &quot;Alice Rosenbaum,&quot; was one example
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I recall offhand);
</EM><BR>
<P>I, some time ago, mentioned that when continental european governments
<BR>
started instituting nationwide censuses, many people who had formerly
<BR>
not had surnames other than some sort of identification of who your
<BR>
father or mother was, were given surnames, typically based on what their
<BR>
trade was, or where they lived. I mentioned, in order to indicate the
<BR>
deep history of anti-semitism in Germany, how German government
<BR>
officials who assigned surnames to such people would frequently make up
<BR>
rather insulting surnames and assign them to Jews. Names like Einhorn (a
<BR>
reference to the penis, aka 'one horn') were rather commonly assigned.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3. Far more interestingly (though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps not relevantly), the case has been made that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libertarianism itself is anti-Semitic (the argument is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tortuously complex, but revolves around an equation of attempts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to avoid the Law [as in &quot;People of The Law&quot;] with attempts to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; avoid governmental control. Very long story.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<P>Neither of which libertarianism is about, by the by, so the argument is
<BR>
really baseless, and promulgated by those who would like to demonize
<BR>
proponents of individual liberty as 'outlaws'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whew!... some interesting points to say the least.  1.  Perhaps in our day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blatant anti-semitism is often not allowed so some people(perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unconsciously even) just barely hint at it.  Circumcision is often seen as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uniquely jewish topic even though it is not.  That medical reasons for it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were not given is interesting.  Tone, topic and facts to back it up DO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.  I have picked up on things jewish being referred to as funny or odd.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember my mind being &quot;pricked&quot; numerous times but than letting the matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go.  These were all on the surface at least very minor things, but still...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3.  I never heard this before!  I am now thinking about the post Mike Lorrey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrote!  I think what he says applies here.  Mike is there anyplace you won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go? lol 
</EM><BR>
<P>I prefer to discuss a matter until understanding is reached. Its a
<BR>
little failing of mine to desire that people understand me and not think
<BR>
ill of me (unless I want them to, of course ;) ). I tend to regard other
<BR>
people's irrational hypersensitivities as logically baseless, and
<BR>
therefore not worthy of consideration as a rational basis for argument
<BR>
or debate (another failing of mine). I expect (frequently improperly)
<BR>
adults to act like adults.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am glad you made us aware of this matter.  I personally had no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea.  I have heard there is major jewish scholarship in methods and shades
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of anti-semitism.  I can see how jews being &quot;people of the law&quot; and having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been persecuted so horribly over the centuries would want strong(but just)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governments in place where they live so their rights would be respected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Libertarianism could create an environment of vulnerability for jewish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people and culture should persecution arise without central authority to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; squash it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is also a baseless claim, considering that the primary sources of
<BR>
persecution of Jews has been due to pogroms encouraged and/or sponsored
<BR>
by large central governments which stripped jews of their ability to
<BR>
resist...
<BR>
<P>I don't necessarily buy the concept of the 'self-hating Jew' by the way,
<BR>
but I do buy the concept of the 'self-vicitimizing Jew', which might be
<BR>
associated with some form of self-hate as the scholars see it, but I
<BR>
don't dwell on such concepts anyways, they are too self defeating.
<BR>
Talking about the idea of the 'self hating Jew' is not anti-semitic,
<BR>
btw, because it refers to a very real cultural paradigm of 'jewish
<BR>
guilt' that I guess is some sort of internalized slave master, dating
<BR>
back to the pharohs, or to the time in Babylon, or under the Romans, or
<BR>
to the golden calf, or even back to the mythical original sin, or maybe
<BR>
it all together. Its kinda-sorta like the phenomenon of Catholic Guilt
<BR>
that the nuns seem to be VERY good at instilling in young women as some
<BR>
sort of self perpetuating meme of self hate. Don't know who does it
<BR>
better. If I base it entirely on my own relationship with my mom, as
<BR>
opposed to the relationship my jewish friends have with their mothers,
<BR>
measuring a 'clinginess' factor, I'd have to say jewish moms generally
<BR>
win hands down, but that is just an impression based on a very small
<BR>
sample.
