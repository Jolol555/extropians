<EM>&gt; &gt; Trouble is, carjackers have a bad habit of capping slow-reacting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; victims, or of taking female victims along for rape &amp; murder.  Stopping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them at the door is a Good Thing.  The first torch unit used in the US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would land the user in jail, alas.  Maybe if it followed the flames with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a halon spray to put the perp out before letting him get totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; toasted... but the prosecutors would probably still label it first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; degree arson.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I once heard of someone who put a piece of wood with nails in it under his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seat so that if someone sat down on the driver's seat he'd get punctured. He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did this because his car wos broken in several times. Well, only soem nights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; later he heard a loud cry, and, yes, it had worked ... but he got a heavy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fine for severe injury. That's law in Germany - I love it. Perhaps that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why I would like to go into politics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I had a freind who had this door mat that was smooth when it laid down on one
<BR>
side, but if you flipped it over, nails stood straight up. He laid this in the
<BR>
middle of his kitchen every night. One night he heard a big yelp, but only found
<BR>
a trail of blood...
<BR>
<P>I think that if the person in your story had put a warning sign against theives
<BR>
in the window, he might have gotten off...
