<P>Attackable with conventional aircraft and surface to air missiles (even of the

<P>Submillimeter radar. new generation IR sensors.

<P><EM>&gt; Cheap balloon decoys. 
</EM><BR>
<P>To do what? they have distinctly different ballistic characteristics and radar

signatures.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Armored warheads.
</EM><BR>
<P>Added weight reduces the total number of warheads you can carry, and makes the
<BR>
warhead either larger, and thus easier to hit, or else denser, and thus a much
<BR>
hotter and easier to spot target.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Warheads in orbit.
</EM><BR>
<P>Easily detectable with xray and gamma ray observation platforms. Allowing
<BR>
warheads in orbit automatically allows you to put warhead powered xray lasers in
<BR>
orbit, which are far far cheaper and more effective than any other laser
<BR>
technology. Every bomb you use as an xray pump can kill 50-200 targets at once.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Electro Magnetic Pulse Bombs.

<P>SHielding.

<P>Definite concern, but detectable with satellite technology when unsheilded.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important of all, quantity.
</EM><BR>
<P>i.e. money. Everyone that hates us is generally dirt poor, with budgets of at
<BR>
most a few million or a few billion bucks. Defending against an expansionist
<BR>
China in the next 40 years is the real goal of SDI. They have this problem about
<BR>
maintaining face which makes them much less tractable than most others. You
<BR>
basically have to drive them into the condition North Korea is in to get them to
<BR>
change anything significant.
<BR>
<P>China's primary targets will be its neighbors, plus Australia, Hawaii, India,
<BR>
and the western coast of the US, plus possibly some Siberian targets as well.
<BR>
When US leaders say 'rogue states' they make it sound like North Korea, but in
<BR>
their hearts they mean China.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;I suggest that these ABM systems cannot be easily defeated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;massive redundancy [ever more warheads] because the laser systems can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;also be multiplied arbitrarily.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, not arbitrarily. You've already admitted that defense is much more expensive than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offence so just building more defense is simply not going to work unless your resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are infinite. They're not.
</EM><BR>
<P>They aren't however, so long as your cost of defense is less than the cost of
<BR>
potential losses from attack, then you come out ahead in the end.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;if I just buy some paint at Home Depot and paint my warhead white you'll have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         &gt;&gt;increase the power of your LASER about a hundred times.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;Awww, c'mon John, humor me just a little.  Do you really believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;those who dream up these systems have not anticipated this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure that somebody involved in the project had taken Physics in High School so the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea must have been tossed around. However they concluded, quite correctly, that it had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing to do with the main function of the system, to provide employment for themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and their friends. I mean, if the system is ever actually needed nobody expects to be held
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accountable afterward when it fails to work as promised.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would expect they would. A failed system will kill some 1 or two out of every
<BR>
three family members. How pissed do you think the survivor is going to be toward
<BR>
those who promised the system would work? The system is very much a threat like
<BR>
the Chinese did last year toward their airline execs, saying they all had to be
<BR>
in the air on new years eve... With SDI, every day is Y2K, and we are all living
<BR>
on the clock.
