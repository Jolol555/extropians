<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'd like to see more on this topic.  I've been living this way for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a few  years now and have never been happier.  It's not that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wouldn't like to have more money--or, more accurately, to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more of the things money buys--but the opportunity to savor each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;day fully is worth more to me than the money would be.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey Bonnie, glad to oblige, since it was your excellent post that
<BR>
ignited this thread (or is it a fuse?). 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;When I was in the process of making the decision to discontinue my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;urban law practice and move to the country I pondered the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lifestyle I'd choose if I had a nearly unlimited supply of money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I decided I'd live in the country and divide my time fairly evenly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;between gardening, study, and writing, with enough social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interaction thrown in to keep me from becoming a hermit (I tend to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be a rather solitary person).  I realized I didn't have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accumulate a large sum of money in order to do this very thing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and I'm now living a lifestyle that's close to my ideal. Perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if I had more money I'd live in a mansion rather than a self-built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;adobe hovel.  But then again, maybe not...every square foot of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;house was built for my own purposes; the place fits me like a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well-worn shoe, and it's been fun building it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Lifestyle is the goal. The heuristic for sensible home ownership is
<BR>
never to assume a morgage more than twice your annual income, the
<BR>
idea is to start small and build equity. Then again you seem happy
<BR>
where you are, so why not put any money into good investments for
<BR>
the long term. (perrenial rather than annual)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Did any particular event prompt you to investigate a simpler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lifestyle?  My eyes began to open to wider possibilities when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spent a morning hanging out with a woman named Donna.  She was one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of those generally referred to as &quot;homeless&quot; although I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think she would have characterized herself in that way.  She'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;found some pieces of lumber and sheet metal and built a shelter in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a vacant city lot; she'd planted a little vegetable garden there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;next to her shelter.  She told me that the night before she'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;found some lobster and shrimp in a grocery store dumpster and had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;invited a bunch of homeless people to share in her bounty.  &quot;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have so much,&quot; she told me, &quot;I feel as though I should share.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Despite having a good job and excellent friends I was still pretty
<BR>
discontented. I use to assuage the stress and occasional loneliness
<BR>
with a Friday night all nighter, then sometimes again on Sat. Many
<BR>
of my associates did the same. I started to over-do it, and decided
<BR>
to quit and pursue higher goals.
<BR>
<P>I made the right decision.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It occurred to me that overall, Donna's quality of life was higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than mine, although she was jobless and I enjoyed a position in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one of the more highly paid professions.  Her days were her own;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;she lived by her own clock and didn't feel constantly rushed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this or that deadline; and she felt herself wealthy enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;indulge in charity. I'm forever grateful to this woman, whom I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;never saw again after that day.
</EM><BR>
<P>She sounds like a wonderfull person, I hope you get to meet her
<BR>
again.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Meeting Donna didn't move me to take up a life on the streets, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I began to give my thoughts a much wider scope in imagining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possible futures for myself.
</EM><BR>
<P>One too many evil hangovers convinced me I was on the wrong track,
<BR>
now I'm positive I'm on the right one.
<BR>
<P>I was going to send the following to Bonnie privately, but since we
<BR>
have so many green thumbs here I thought everyone might enjoy it.
<BR>
<P>Since I'm an urban cliff dweller, I don't have any gardening space
<BR>
(other than windowsill herbs) but several of my homeowning friends
<BR>
received spring seed gifts from me including this wonderfull
<BR>
plant......

*Rainbow Inca Corn: An Example of Plant Breeding
<BR>
-----------------------------------------------
<BR>
Excerpted from our latest book, Gardening for the Future of the
<BR>
Earth...
<BR>
<A HREF="http://store.yahoo.com/seedsofchange/garforfut.html">http://store.yahoo.com/seedsofchange/garforfut.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Alan Kapulers very first breeding project, which produced our
<BR>
Rainbow Inca Corn, occurred when he was living in a commune in
<BR>
southern Oregon, growing vegetables. Plant breeder Carol Deppe
<BR>
tells the story: Rainbow Inca didnt start as a breeding project; it
<BR>
began as a spiritual act, a ceremony. Alan had grown a number of
<BR>
different varieties of corn the previous year, and he had chosen
<BR>
his twelve favorite ears of all the varieties. The ears were of
<BR>
all different kinds and colors  flour corns, native Indian corns,
<BR>
heirloom sweet corns, and other varieties. He shelled out the
<BR>
chosen twelve and planted the kernels in rows, sowing all the seed
<BR>
of one type, then starting on the next, wherever he was in the row.
<BR>
The corn was all in one patch, in somewhat intermingled blocks.
<BR>
<P>Because of mole activity, Alan replanted randomly and at different
<BR>
dates, so that corn of various kinds was scattered throughout the
<BR>
patch. This meant that all kinds of crosses could happen, even
<BR>
between very early and late types. He wasnt thinking about this at
<BR>
the time; its just the way it happened. One of the corns Alan
<BR>
planted was an Incan flour corn with huge, flat white seeds and
<BR>
plants about twelve feet high. When Alan harvested his
<BR>
corn, the ears on his Incan corn were especially beautiful, and
<BR>
there were one or two colored seeds on each ear that represented
<BR>
pollination by a colored variety. There were yellows, reds,
<BR>
purples, and blues; solid colors, stripes, blazes, and spots; clear
<BR>
colors and iridescent ones. There were a hundred to a hundred and
<BR>
fifty colored kernels altogether. Alan picked the colored kernels
<BR>
off the ears and saved them.
<BR>
<P>He planted about a hundred of the colored kernels the next year.
<BR>
When he harvested the patch, the ears showed an occasional crinkled
<BR>
seed, representing sweet types. The genes associated with sweet
<BR>
corn are recessive, so no crinkled kernels appeared in the original
<BR>
crosses involving the flour-type Incan mother plants. There were
<BR>
about forty crinkled kernels the following year. His harvest was
<BR>
about five pounds of kernels, all sweet and of all colors.
<BR>
<P>He selected for large, crinkled, flat kernels and planted a couple
<BR>
of ounces of seed. In subsequent years he continued selecting for
<BR>
large, fat kernels of all colors. He also selected for plant height
<BR>
of about eight feet instead of the ten to twelve feet typical of
<BR>
the original Incan corn (eight-foot plants were enough earlier in
<BR>
the season to be dependable). And he selected for ears that were
<BR>
lower on the plant  so I could reach them, he says. Lower ears are
<BR>
also larger, so selection for lower ears automatically selects for
<BR>
bigger ears and higher yield.
<BR>
<P>Rainbow Inca sweet corn preserves the cytoplasm of the original
<BR>
Incan flour corn and a large amount of genetic variability derived
<BR>
from many sources. The kernels are of all colors and patterns, huge
<BR>
compared to any other sweet corn, and broad and flat. The plants
<BR>
are about eight feet tall. Its of late and reliable maturity here
<BR>
in Oregon (meaning that it would probably be considered midseason
<BR>
in most areas). Its undoubtedly been automatically selected for
<BR>
productivity in cool weather because of where it was bred; the
<BR>
flavor is excellent.
<BR>
<P>Alan didnt realize that he had developed something special until he
<BR>
offered his Rainbow Inca through the Seed Savers Exchange and heard
<BR>
the reactions of those who grew it. Its excellent, unusual, unlike
<BR>
anything else, they said. Rainbow Inca
<BR>
<A HREF="http://store.yahoo.com/seedsofchange/sweetcorrain.html">http://store.yahoo.com/seedsofchange/sweetcorrain.html</A> is currently
<BR>
offered by Seeds of Change and remains one of the most unusual
<BR>
corns available.
