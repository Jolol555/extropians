<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ahem. Taxation in the UK is roughly on a par with the USA -- it's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; lowest tax zone in Europe, and one of the lowest tax regimes in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; developed world. Welfare bureaucracy is minimal, too. This is the country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; where an allegedly left-wing government is privatising the air traffic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; control system and the post office, and has privatised most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; infrastructure items that are handled by local government in the USA.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I was referring to the US on those, but is health care privatized yet? What is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ratio of police to civilians?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Healthcare: if you want private treatment, you can pay for it. There aren't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any restrictions on private healthcare. (What there _is_ is a big supplier,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; funded via the tax system, that has 98% of the market.)
</EM><BR>
<P>So 98% of the health care market is still socialized, is what I was
<BR>
asking. Better health care goes only to those who can afford it,
<BR>
everyone else gets rationed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Police: not sure, but I think it's under 0.1% of the population. Certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we hear more complaints about there not being enough police than about there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being too many.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which police are those? Last time I was at Heathrow, the place was
<BR>
positively crawling with 'police' with HK's and Uzi's.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've heard that the violent crime rates are up some 28% or so over there...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In 12 months, yes. Note that there's a statistically significant correlation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between violent crime and economic performance in the UK. The economy isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; booming by US standards, but it's doing better than at any time in the past
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thirty years. (Postulated cause: economy doing well == more young men with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money to spend on alcohol. Second postulated cause: those people who _aren't_
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing well see more affluence around them and are more inclined to go in for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crime as a way of augmenting their standard of living.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What _is_ noticeable is a displacement of crime from surveillance areas to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those places that aren't covered.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>How about the proposition that due to the better economy, the black
<BR>
market of the criminals is more valuable, and therefore more worth
<BR>
protecting, as well as affording criminals the ability to better afford
<BR>
black market weapons. Granted you'll have a lot more Liverpool toughs
<BR>
who can afford to go and cause trouble at the football games.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Make BBZ's illegal, of course.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;What's this? Oh, its a camping microwave, oh, not that, no, thats a fleadle-o-meter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What does it do? Well, it would be a little hard for a layman like yourself to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; understand, being a highly technical piece of equipment, but its VERY SENSITIVE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; equiment, expensive too. You wouldn't want to damage it at all, inspector. I'm here to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; demonstrate it to various parties in the defence industry. Who? Well I'm not at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; liberty to say....&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Try that on your average copper over here and you will rapidly learn how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say &quot;I just have a habit of falling down stairs in police stations&quot; to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; local magistrate. _If_ you don't want to make things worse for yourself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Again, note: I'm not in favour of this shit, I'm just describing the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things work in the real world. The public image of the polite and unarmed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; British bobby is just that, these days -- public image spin.)
</EM><BR>
<P>It might not work, but as has been shown with many a hacker, a little
<BR>
social engineering can go a long way on occasion. Appropriate supporting
<BR>
ID props also work well. Its funny, you don't know how many speeding
<BR>
tickets the mere existence of my concealed weapons permit has gotten me
<BR>
out of.....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Fibre optics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Which need to be resolved into digital form somewhere, or else processed in optical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; circuits. Using a laser system would work wonders to fry such optical circuits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure. I was thinking of cameras a few metres from the optical head,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and some sort of attenuator or fuse to stop that sort of attack. Which,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incidentally, is going to get you nailed _fast_. One of the obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things for the law'n'order brigate to do with cameras is to vigorously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prosecute people caught vandalizing them. Another obvious thing is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrest anyone seen approaching a camera that goes blank. And one thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they _already_ do is put up cameras with overlapping fields of view, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that if you take out one, you'll be on tape via the other.
</EM><BR>
<P>So my earlier assertions of the number of cameras needed goes up if you
<BR>
have overlapping fields of view that are at sufficient resolution to use
<BR>
as evidence. More expensive system, higher taxes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Neural network detection of suspicious behaviour -- lurking with intent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;    to zap a camera _will_ get you highlighted and questioned by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;    police. (This latter is currently in active development by, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;    example, London Underground, who want to be able to spot trouble on tube
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;    train platforms -- like disturbances, bombs, pick-pockets, or potential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;    suicide risks.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So I have a HUD on the inside of my sunglasses, and the BBZ fry-o-lator is disguised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as my breifcase. I use cortical scanning to identify targets, the AI of my fryolator
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; focuses the beam on the cameras as I spot new targets, and I simply walk on by....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here you're pitting future-tech against present-day tech. I sympathise, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it won't work. By the time you get your HUD and cortical scanning widget
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and AI, the control freaks will have something better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, the aiming technology exists today, its part of your standard
<BR>
attack helicopter. The tech is available and all you need to do is
<BR>
miniaturize it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Remember, they outnumber you, and they've got more money.
</EM><BR>
<P>The point of active measures in civil disobedience is to make it as
<BR>
expensive as possible for them to maintain their authority. A low level
<BR>
war of attrition on them, even if your side has losses, will sap their
<BR>
will to the point where they will push for greater, more overt, control,
<BR>
raise taxes, and be more likely to public violate the human rights of
<BR>
those of us they do catch. Standard ChiCom insurgency strategy. Works
<BR>
wonders.
