<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Number of cameras necessary to cover every square meter of the dry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;land
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the planet:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 20,000,000,000,000, or 20 trillion cameras
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;lots of ranting about the non-feasibility of ubiquitous surveillance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; snipped&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It might help to keep in mind a couple of things:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are lots of ways to skin a cat.  Ubiquitous surveillance does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessarily mean that there will be a Sony camcorder installed every square
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 20 feet all over the surface of the globe, or that the cameras which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deployed will necessarily be constantly recording every minute of every day.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   It would make more sense to have only 1 or 2 cameras per person (worn on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the wrist--watch style, or perhaps following you around like a gnat, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointing at you from satellites overhead, or perhaps any one of several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other ways).  This would limit the cameras now to approx. 12 billion max
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (*significantly* less than 20 trillion).
</EM><BR>
<P>Hardly. You are falsely assuming that *everyone* will willingly wear
<BR>
these nannybots, especially criminals or former criminals, or those with
<BR>
criminal intent. Without an overall system of surveillance to crosscheck
<BR>
against the voluntary system, you have no way of knowning who is
<BR>
actually wearing a realy system or just a fake system, much as many
<BR>
people don't have real security cameras today, just fake cameras with
<BR>
blinking lights.
<BR>
<P>You run into the same conundrum of the gun control people (which is not
<BR>
surprising, since you seem to have the same mental failings with regard
<BR>
to that issue as well) who falsely assume that those who are criminals
<BR>
or who have criminal intent will obey all gun control laws.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moreover if you fixed it so that the cameras only started &quot;rolling&quot; when the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subject did certain specified activities (say, communicating or interacting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a person, computer or near-anything device) you could save oodles of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recording time (and storage space).
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sorry, but this is totally false. You need something to be analysing
<BR>
this video feed to make the determination that a subject is doing
<BR>
certain activities, which implies computation, and bandwidth allocation,
<BR>
as well as memory buffering.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But probably the biggest thing to keep in mind is that we are talking about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tomorrow's problems, tomorrow's solutions and *tomorrow's* technology.  So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even if this type of surveillance is not available with today's technology,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that has little bearing on whether it will be feasible when its needed.  And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; once we get to, or even close to, the singularity *all* bets are off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regarding what technology will and will not be able to do.
</EM><BR>
<P>Tomorrows technology will operate by the same physical laws as our
<BR>
current technology. They may be more capable, more compact, maybe even
<BR>
less expensive (note: Moore's Law does not dictate lower prices. Lower
<BR>
prices are a consequence of obsolescence), but they will still have
<BR>
limits. Beleiving that the future will solve all of your problems is
<BR>
just one more type of millenial faith that is no different than
<BR>
christianity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lastly, for those on the list who just absolutely *can't* wrap their minds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around the fact that a great deal of the surveillance technology we have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been discussing is, if not available today, just around the corner, I might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggest this sobering book:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _The End of Privacy : How Total Surveillance Is Becoming a Reality_
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by Reg Whitaker &amp; Reginald Whitaker
</EM><BR>
<P>And while they are talking about advanced concepts, they don't discuss
<BR>
the costs, or the cost effectiveness of the 'technologies' they talk
<BR>
about. Of course, they can't otherwise their arguments would be out the
<BR>
window. 
<BR>
<P>This dovetails with the other thread wondering why early futurists of
<BR>
the 20th century were so pro-space and now most futurists have all but
<BR>
given up on space. Its all a matter of attention to economics. The
<BR>
futurists of the early to mid 20th century were absolutely convinced
<BR>
that by the beginning of the 21st century that we would have practical
<BR>
faster than light propulsion technology, that a large percentage of the
<BR>
human race would be living in space, on the moon, or on another planet.
<BR>
Why did they feel this way? Because they used a graph plotting out
<BR>
increases in technologies of velocity, much as many extropians and
<BR>
transhumanists trot out plots of Moore's Law and other graphs today, to
<BR>
show that they expected a manned space station by 1972, a moon base by
<BR>
1980, a Mars base by 1990, and interstellar probes by 2000. All of their
<BR>
expectations turned out to be false, specifically because of the issue
<BR>
of cost effectiveness. Its just too damn expensive to use chemical
<BR>
rockets, and nuclear rockets are politically infeasible for surface
<BR>
launches, no matter how affordable they make space travel.
<BR>
<P>Mr Zero has no concept of, or at least had demonstrated no in depth
<BR>
knowledge of, the economics of the policies he advocates. Civilizations
<BR>
only practice the morals they can afford, but he doesn't seem to
<BR>
understand this, which is typical of someone who beleives in socialist
<BR>
ideas. As morally abhorrent as we in the present day find ideas of
<BR>
slavery (at least those of us who value the sanctity of the individual),
<BR>
slavery, as a tool of economic development, only became morally
<BR>
offensive to the majority when the majority had obtained sufficient
<BR>
technology to make the need for slavery obsolete. Civil rights
<BR>
originally only applied to the aristocracy that could afford them (the
<BR>
Magna Carta only applied to englishmen who were property owners).
<BR>
<P>I do beleive in, and advocate ideas like Mr. Halperin's concept of the
<BR>
Truth Machine as a tool for determining guilt or innocence and as a
<BR>
technology for supporting honor, honesty and integrity in business
<BR>
dealings. I also advocate personal monitor systems as Mr. Zero describes
<BR>
for people who are convicted felons, in lieu of execution or permanent
<BR>
imprisonment. Those accused of victimless crimes, or merely financial
<BR>
crimes, should also be likewise monitored for the duration of their
<BR>
sentences. However, those individuals who have not committed felonious
<BR>
offenses against their fellow man, who have demonstrated a consistent
<BR>
record of honorable and honest civil behavior, should not be treated as
<BR>
if they are felons merely because they are human beings, otherwise, you
<BR>
should expect no less from the best members of society than the worst
<BR>
behavior you normally see from the worst members of society. When you
<BR>
degrade the standard of performance, the median performance degrades to
<BR>
meet the new lower standard.
