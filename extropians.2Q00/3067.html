<EM>&gt; I also have some comments remaining that haven't been entirely obsoleted

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (1)  Nanoweaponry fighting it out on the nanoscale arrives relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; late in the game; in real life, the first two &quot;nanoweapons&quot; to have a

<EM>&gt; military impact would be diamondoid jet fighters and the like, followed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by saturation launches of vat-grown nuclear weapons.

<P>Disagree. It ain't sexy, but if I was looking for a lethal war-fighting
<BR>
tool I'd go for the humble wasp. Use GM techniques to implant the genes
<BR>
required to synthesize tetrodotoxin -- or preferably some neurotransmitter
<BR>
used by mammals but not by insects. (Insects run on GABA and acetylcholine,
<BR>
IIRC; there's got to be something that you can disrupt in humans that
<BR>
won't affect a wasp, hasn't there?) At this point, you have a lethal but
<BR>
unguided missile. The next step is to add broadband peer-to-peer networking,
<BR>
hooks into its nervous system and optice nerves. Finally, figure out how to
<BR>
automate the process, and turn whole swarm of the things into a distributed
<BR>
area-denial weapon.
<BR>
<P>I have this vision of an armoured division rolling across the frontier
<BR>
with cover from helicopter gunships, facing effectively no opposition ...
<BR>
except that as soon as they stop to refuel and re-arm, soldiers start
<BR>
dying. The survivors bottle up and go hog-wild with Sarin, and presently
<BR>
they discover that they can function, after a fashion, if they observe
<BR>
full NBC precautions. So they drive on into the enemy capital and declare
<BR>
themselves to be an army of occupation ... except that anyone who 
<BR>
ventures out of their sealed chemwar-proofed environment simply dies.
<BR>
There are a billion bluetooth-networked wasps loose in the city; they
<BR>
won't sting anyone who isn't wearing an enemy uniform or carrying a gun,
<BR>
but they know exactly where the enemy soldiers are, and they're fairly
<BR>
resistant to insecticides -- resistant enough that a high enough dose to
<BR>
knock them down reliably won't do the humans in the vicinity any good,
<BR>
either.
<BR>
<P>(How do you go about occupying enemy territory when just taking your gas
<BR>
mask off is presenting your face to the stingers of stealthy, lethal,
<BR>
enemy insects?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We'd have to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through that without blowing ourselves up before we'd get the chance to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dust the biosphere.  Even if Freitas's paper is entirely true in every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detail, it doesn't mean - as a policy conclusion - that there's a safe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; path to nanotechnology.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
More to the point ...
<BR>
<P>How does the assumption that the grey goo arises accidentally, or
<BR>
deliberately, skew the issue?
<BR>
<P>I would expect most grey goo incidents to be the unfortunate side-effects
<BR>
of experiments with replicators. But there may well be some that are the
<BR>
result of groups with similar pathological attitudes to Aum Shinriko, who
<BR>
set out to create grey goo.  The latter is going to be much harder to
<BR>
deal with; for starters, we can expect them to be stealthed, and for seconds
<BR>
they're liable to be much more efficient than an accidental mutation.
