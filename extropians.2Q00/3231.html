The limits of my science education are easily defined.  Outside of an
<BR>
ultra-lite b.a. in 1970s Social &quot;sciences&quot;, I watch Discovery Channel, and
<BR>
read Sci American and Nature at Chapters Bookstore each month, (lately they
<BR>
don't have Nature).  I was a host at the Moody Bible Institoot Sermons from
<BR>
Science Pavilion at the 1967 World's Fair in Montreal.  That should count
<BR>
for something.  I must have seen those movies 100 times.
<BR>
<P>Besides the above I've read &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; twice, &quot;Black Holes
<BR>
and Baby Universes&quot; once, the first third of &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;,
<BR>
and Kaku's &quot;Hyperspace&quot;.  As a layman my benefit from each of these books,
<BR>
and this mailing list is mostly a thrilling stimulation of imagination.

<P><P>Yes. With every human comes an Ego and yes, Michio Kaku is no different.
<BR>
Science is not independent of culture because even though a measurement may
<BR>
be independent of 'values', the interpretation of such measurements seem
<BR>
always to be subject, ultimately, to the majoritarian view, within a field
<BR>
of study.

<P>&lt;&lt; Well, considering that some half dozen or so of these units have survived
<BR>
re-entry (every one that did reenter), and a few have even be recovered and
<BR>
reused on other spacecraft, there should be plenty of confidence in our
<BR>
technology. Instead, he pointed at the one incident of a Russian nuclear
<BR>
generator device re-entering in Canada that was not designed with anywhere
<BR>
near
<BR>
the level of relaibility that ours were, and using that incident to tar all
<BR>
use
<BR>
of nuclear power in space, much as our own light water reactors get tarred
<BR>
by
<BR>
people comparing them to Chernobyl, when the Chernobyl technology was a)
<BR>
less
<BR>
reliable and b) intentionally put into near meltdown condition. Kaku knows
<BR>
all of
<BR>
these things, he is more interested in getting media face time to make
<BR>
himself
<BR>
into the Carl Sagan of the 21st century than in scientific objectivity.

<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; Thats primarily my concern. Anyone who calls themselves a scientist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  should have the integrity to acknowledge that a) the chances of it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  hitting earth were infinitesimal, b) if they did hit earth, they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  designed to survive reentry and impact intact without leakage. His tv
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  lobbying over that issue was disgusting and dishonest &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He was dishonest IF he could see beyond his own personal prejudices which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; usually blind a person (all of us) into thinking beyond the current
</EM><BR>
paradigm.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; If he really knew better (had confidence in the reentry shielding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering) he might've given thought to changing his mind. Similarly, a
</EM><BR>
lot
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of the best scientists had a prejudice in Favor of uranium 235,BWR style
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power plants, before the practical testing and evaluation had been
</EM><BR>
performed.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Again its a matter of people discovering the truth and deciding what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important.
