<EM>&gt; As an anarcho-capitalist, objectivist libertarian from the '60's on, it

<EM>&gt; pains me deeply to actually find myself even close to the same side of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things as Janet Baby-killer Reno, but the fact is that if you were really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aware of how badly the market has been served by the MS mob, and why, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hopefully would never have made such silly remarks.  MS, to me, represents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the triumph of a fundamentally idealess moneyed yuppy oligarchy in using a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corrupt system to sell amazingly shoddy products to an ignorant market.
</EM><BR>
And
<BR>
<EM>&gt; they didn't even invent that!
</EM><BR>
<P>If your analysis is correct, the very concept of anarcho-capitalism is
<BR>
fundamentally flawed. Any society based on personal freedom must be built on
<BR>
the presumption that individuals are largely capable of making their own
<BR>
decisions, and that leaving them free to do so is the best available
<BR>
approach to running an economy. If, OTOH, individuals are fools and informed
<BR>
experts can make better decisions than the markets, then the technocratic
<BR>
socialists are right to demand control of the economy.
<BR>
<P>One of the hard parts of advocating freedom is realizing that you,
<BR>
personally, are not exempt from the arguments we have long advanced against
<BR>
the centralization of authority. If a panel of experts can't be trusted to
<BR>
decide which product we should all use, neither can a panel of one. If a
<BR>
free market makes a decision you think is stupid, odds are that you are the
<BR>
one who is wrong. At the very least, you should assume that the result is
<BR>
due to differences in individual desires, needs, abilities and/or
<BR>
information, rather than some kind of sinister plot.
<BR>
<P>Claims that the &quot;wrong&quot; product has won out in a free market are commonplace
<BR>
among supporters of the products that lost, but they almost invariably turn
<BR>
out to be incorrect.
