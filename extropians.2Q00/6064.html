<P>John, although you've said things critical of me, it's clear
<BR>
you've thought hard about this, which I appreciate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; She does deserve a very sincere and heartfelt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apology from you.
</EM><BR>
<P>I simply don't see that yet. Indeed, I think _I_ am more
<BR>
deserving of an apology.
<BR>
<P>The following is what I REALLY don't get at all! Honestly! If
<BR>
any Extropian can explain it to me, you can. (Note, I checked my
<BR>
interpretations with some non-Extropians on-hand here
<BR>
physically, ALL of whom thought Natasha's reactions have been
<BR>
deeply wrong, in at least some way.)--&gt;

</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Arghh!! Brian, with language like this you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shoot yourself in the foot!!  This is extreme
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rudeness to Natasha!
</EM><BR>
<P>John! Why aren't you telling Natasha not to be so rude to ME?!!!
<BR>
<P>Telling me I'm not working towards the Good isn't rude?!!
<BR>
<P>Yikes! She's saying, in essence, all the time I've put into this
<BR>
discussion is for naught, and not just that, but, as I interpret
<BR>
it, she's even impugning my intentions (but she might just mean
<BR>
that I'm not achieving my intentions).
<BR>
<P>Maybe Natasha and I have different sensitivities (and Extropians
<BR>
and non-Extropians, too, it seems, going by reactions of
<BR>
non-Ext. friends of mine). When I read that, I thought it was
<BR>
one of the most obnoxious things anyone's said to me in months.
<BR>
I'm a PLATONIST, and she is more likely to know that than I am
<BR>
to know who her ex- is! To say I'm not working towards the Good
<BR>
is like telling a Christian he's the anti-Christ.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; :(  Please be much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more tactful in the future.  You can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make your points without lashing out.
</EM><BR>
<P>In most cases, I think you're right. I was SO frustrated at
<BR>
Natasha's repeated misinterpretations that I simply thought that
<BR>
a barrage might get her to see how much she was upsetting me.
<BR>
(Well, also, I partly just lost control.)
<BR>
<P>Now, about the boyfriend thing:
<BR>
<P>This was simply a misunderstanding that I corrected TWICE.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The man she used to be with, FM-2030 is one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the founders of transhumanist thought(dating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the '60's) and from all accounts I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heard, a true gentleman.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's not in queston! It must be that people (including
<BR>
Natasha) think she's famous or well-known enough that by
<BR>
&quot;ex-boyfriend&quot; I must mean FM-2030. But, taking the content of
<BR>
the jest non-jestingly, let me be clear: FM-2030 is NOT the
<BR>
person I meant.
<BR>
<P>I referred repeatedly to a problem of reference, such as the old
<BR>
Hesperus Phosphorous philosophy problem. This is something that
<BR>
can EASILY be looked up on the Web, if Natasha wasn't familiar
<BR>
with it. Or she could have asked me, instead of simply IGNORING
<BR>
my explanation.
<BR>
<P><P>Anyway, the idea is (I'm re-phrasing the traditional
<BR>
formulation): If I say, &quot;the evening star caused the problem,&quot;
<BR>
and I mean the bright thing in the sky near the sun right after
<BR>
it sets (WHATEVER it be -- Mercury or Venus or Planet X), and
<BR>
someone reacts, &quot;damn you, Venus would never do a thing like
<BR>
that!!&quot; they've suffered a reference trauma (perhaps as a result
<BR>
of my bad word choice -- but either way, they haven't got my
<BR>
meaning).
<BR>
<P>Let's be clear: I was NOT talking about FM-2030, and said as
<BR>
much MORE THAN ONCE.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But you HAVE been rude to Natasha. She does deserve a very sincere and heartfelt apology from you.  It was HIGHLY improper of you to &quot;in jest&quot; conjecture that the author of the accusatory emails was her ex-boyfriend.
</EM><BR>
&lt;
<BR>
<P>But it wasn't even that kind of jest. It was CLEARLY a piece of
<BR>
rhetoric designed to show the extreme lengths to which one would
<BR>
have to go in order to figure out why someone would want to
<BR>
slander Max. (I was actually complimenting Max.)
<BR>
<P>Here it is again:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Max, I should be completely open and admit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I may have been unable to shake the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; influence of the psychotic asshole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Natasha's ex-boyfriend? I can't think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of any other reason...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who until recently was emailing me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; telling me you're the root of
</EM><BR>
<P>(By the way, now that I think about it, &quot;any other _reason_&quot;
<BR>
instead of &quot;any other _person_&quot; makes my meaning fairly clear,
<BR>
esp. the reference issue.)
<BR>
<P>MORE IMPORTANTLY, I explained that that was my meaning. The fact
<BR>
that Natasha would -- so it seems -- willfully ignore my
<BR>
explanation, and continue to be hostile towards me, and act as
<BR>
if I hadn't explained it, strengthened my assumption that some
<BR>
kind of tribalism or something (I don't know what) is the true
<BR>
explanation for her hostility.
<BR>
<P>When I clarify like so:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Goodness, Natasha, it was a joke, quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; obviously so, going by the reactions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; others. The point was: under the assumption
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; that these emails have no basis in fact, there has to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; something highly irrational going on.
</EM><BR>
<P>And then Natasha reacts yet AGAIN as if I didn't explain it, it
<BR>
begins to seem -- quite strongly -- like she's simply looking
<BR>
for excuses to insult me.
<BR>
<P>Even if you disagree (if so, I'd like to know why), can you see
<BR>
that my reaction is understandable? She's reacting based on an
<BR>
interpretation of me that is pretty much as BAD as possible.
<BR>
More importantly: it's an interpretation that's very difficult
<BR>
to sustain.

<EM>&gt; If you're not simply trying to score debating points (badly, I might add), I can only conclude that English -- or, certainly, American English -- is not your native language (your odd assumption that &quot;boyfriend&quot; has to refer to a lover who is boy is the more obvious ex.). If so, please slow down before responding.

<P><EM>&gt; &quot;I can only conclude that english-- or, certainly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; American English -- is not your native
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; language&quot; is extremely insulting language!
</EM><BR>
<P>Why else is she not getting a very simple point I'm making
<BR>
repeatedly?!!! (And, by the way, you might again be assuming
<BR>
she's famous enough that I would know she's American or British
<BR>
(or Irish, etc.), in which this would clearly be insulting. In
<BR>
fact, I know no such thing. Calling someone, say, German, isn't
<BR>
insulting, right?)
<BR>
<P>John, it looks to me like she's simply looking for excuses to
<BR>
insult me!
<BR>
<P><P>I greatly appreciate your efforts, but I'm starting to get
<BR>
pissed off about this. So I'm going to cool it (though I'm
<BR>
afraid I must reaspond to Max's hostile post).
<BR>
<P>Something ain't right in Denmark.
<BR>
<P>Thanks again, John. Please consider my points. This is a more
<BR>
complicated matter than even you might appreciate.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes,
<BR>
Brian.
