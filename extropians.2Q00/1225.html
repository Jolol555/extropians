<EM>&gt; &gt;   The human machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  produces CO2 exhaust and probably has poorer conversion efficiency than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  some of the better types of carbon burning power plants (gas turbines?).

<EM>&gt; huh.... something tells me our convicts are not going to stop producing CO2 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exhaust bike or no bike... we're still burning fuel, and we're still 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; breathing, whether we're sitting in a cell, or pumping iron in a jail yard or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; washing clothes or fighting.. or making license plates....
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Of course, but the normal exhaust rate is a fraction of what it is when
<BR>
the body is in a vigorous aerobic mode.  If this was not the case, people
<BR>
wouldn't ride bikes to burn excess calories.  You could easily triple or
<BR>
quadruple total emissions by using people for power generation rather than
<BR>
letting them do their usual, less vigorous activities.
<BR>
<P>My point was mostly that one won't be reducing CO2 emissions by using
<BR>
people to generate electricity rather than more conventional types of
<BR>
power plants.  Environmentally friendly power is not a good reason for
<BR>
having people ride bikes, although this doesn't mean the idea doesn't have
<BR>
merit.  Perhaps you could have the bikes available to power the prisoners'
<BR>
facilities e.g. no bike riding means no lights, no hot water, etc.  That
<BR>
might be a good way to instill a TANSTAAFL ethic.
