<EM>&gt; &gt; However, there are very competent bodies who set out open industry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; standards for software, hardware and the Internet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Open standards are primarily a marketing tool used by companies that have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tiny market shares to persuade people to buy their products. Sometimes such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a &quot;standard&quot; will actually become so commonly used as to become the normal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way of doing things (i.e. HTML), but it is just as common for a completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proprietary standard produced by a big company to end up in that role (i.e.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ODBC).
</EM><BR>
<P>HTML is not a company-originated standard. As Adrian pointed out on this
<BR>
thread, it was produced by a scientist (Tim Berners-Lee).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Just because a bunch of companies get together and issue a 'standard' does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not mean that their work should have any special protections, or that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone should immediately adopt it.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I point out below, I don't expect them to.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; And you know what? I'm not even suggesting Microsoft has to use them!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; They are more than welcome to go off and use their own proprietary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; standards instead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What I *really* object to is the way they take the standards, claim they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are using them, and then produce their own broken implementation, add
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; own undocumented features, and use their position to make sure those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; changes get spread and used, causing incompatibilities everywhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you think this is some special sin of Microsoft's, you need to look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around more often.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not saying it is. But Microsoft is a particularly bad offender, and
<BR>
their exploitation of their monopoly position allows them to magnify the
<BR>
effects of this interference.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Interoperability standards, like TCP and HTTP, are another matter. Because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their purpose is to allow products from different vendors to work together,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is usually in everyone's best interests to fully codify and support them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No one has much to gain from adding proprietary features, or trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sabotage someone else's implementation, so it doesn't happen very often. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this field Microsoft has actually done an outstanding job - in less than a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decade they moved from a very primitive OS based entirely on proprietary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software to a competitive product that supports every significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interoperability standard I've ever heard of (and a lot of insignificant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ones as well).
</EM><BR>
<P>Aha! But Microsoft can, and do, disrupt these. These are the ones I am
<BR>
bothered about. 
<BR>
<P>When HTTP/1.1 was introduced, Microsoft rushed ahead and implemented it
<BR>
before the standard was finalised, so they could stick 'HTTP/1.1' on
<BR>
their server products. As a result, there are incompatible versions of
<BR>
HTTP/1.1 in circulation (not only Microsoft's). Now clients have to be
<BR>
written to work around the broken parts of each one, and in some cases
<BR>
features HTTP/1.1 was supposed to introduce cannot be effectively used.
<BR>
<P>A good recent example is the Kerberos authentication protocol. Windows
<BR>
2000 clients and servers claim to use this, but Microsoft have added
<BR>
undocumented features which make it incompatible.
<BR>
<P>(Given the spread of the WWW, I would personally say that HTML should be
<BR>
considered an interoperability standard).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I have no objection to Microsoft writing and selling their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; software, and making a hell a lot of money out of it. But they don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have any right to make things difficult for those (who are *not*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; competitors of theirs) trying to ensure people have the freedom to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whichever tools they wish to make use of the infrastructure, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whatever reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That sounds very noble and high-minded, but in practice what you want is for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MS to be forbidden from competing with anyone who chooses to wrap themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the 'open standards' flag.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I'm not. I'm suggesting that if they choose to do so, they either
<BR>
use those open standards without corrupting them, or invent their own
<BR>
and at least be honest they're doing so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; (such as because Microsoft's are buggy and insecure).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ten years ago this remark would have been on target. Five years ago the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter would have been arguable. Today it is simply ignorant prejudice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft's current performance in both these areas is in the top 25% of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industry, and still improving at a steady rate. They aren't the best in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world, but they are much better than average, and unless the Unix vendors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get their collective act together they *will* be the best in another five
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years or so.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not ignorant prejudice, this is based on my direct experience,
<BR>
and observation of numerous security mailing lists and advisories.
<BR>
<P>Their security record is dreadful. Witness for one thing the critical
<BR>
buffer overflow problem discovered last June in NT4/IIS, which they also
<BR>
took some time to fix. More recently the IO.SYS problems in Win95/98,
<BR>
which they have refused to release fixes for despite people *sending*
<BR>
them patches.
