Dear Extropes,
<BR>
<P><P>This message discusses some ways (without tissue samples) that we
<BR>
can record ourselves, and those people that we care about.
<BR>
<P>----------------------------------
<BR>
Suggestion 1: Robert's suggestion.
<BR>
----------------------------------
<BR>
<P>From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20Recording%20people%20[was:%20Recreating%20people]&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110700b54b67f9ca6a@[149.217.0.137]&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.com</A>&gt;: Sun, 14 May 2000
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So, for those individuals who can't quite convince their parents or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;loved ones that lifespan extension, cryonics, etc is &quot;real&quot;, you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do an &quot;end-run&quot; around their lack of foresight.  Sit down with them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with a video camera and get them to tell lots of stories about their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life.  &quot;Interview&quot; them for their not-yet-born family so they will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be able to &quot;know&quot; who Great-Grandma or Great-Grandpa was.
</EM><BR>
<P>I endorse this suggestion whole-heartedly. You will likely find that
<BR>
your &quot;subject&quot; will be enthusiastic about the project, as well.
<BR>
<P>You can start with this book:
<BR>
<P>_Recording Your Family History_
<BR>
by William Fletcher
<BR>
Dodd, Mead and Company
<BR>
New York
<BR>
1986
<BR>
(A Guide to Preserving Oral History with Videotape, Audiotape,
<BR>
Suggested Topics and Questions, Interview Techniques)
<BR>
<P>This book lists a few hundred pages of questions and suggestions for
<BR>
interviewing your family.
<BR>
<P>I paged through the book, 10 years ago, and I selected the questions
<BR>
that I liked, and then adapted the questions to the two people in my
<BR>
family to whom I wanted to focus my attention. I generated 15 pages of
<BR>
interview notes from this book for my interviews to my father and
<BR>
uncle.
<BR>
<P>Here are just a few example interview questions, (adapted to my
<BR>
uncle), to give you an idea.
<BR>
<P><P>Section I: Family History
<BR>
<P>(Grandmother- father's side)
<BR>
* Can you remember anything about her?
<BR>
* Do any memories come to mind of things you did with her?
<BR>
* Did she work outside the home, or was she mainly a housewife and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mother?
<BR>
* Tell me a story about her that would characterize her- something
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that she did, or her response to something that happened to her.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Any other stories about ancestors)
<BR>
* Any stories about the Graps family or about the Grafs family
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that we haven't mentioned?
<BR>
* Do you know of any &quot;black sheep,&quot; or notorious or eccentric
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;characters on either side of the family?
<BR>
<P>Section II: Childhood
<BR>
<P>* What was the most important event or experience of your life between
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the ages of one and twelve?
<BR>
* What were some of the significant local places that you liked the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;best? A particular vacant lot? An old house, a corner store?
<BR>
* How would you describe yourself as a child?  How have other
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;people described you?
<BR>
* Did you ever have any important or memorable dreams as a child?
<BR>
* What did you want to be when you grew up? What happened to that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ambition?
<BR>
<P>Section III: Youth: Teenage Years
<BR>
<P>* What would you pick out as the most significant event of your life
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;during this period, from about age twelve to about twenty?
<BR>
* Who were your best friends?
<BR>
* Who was the craziest one among your crowd?
<BR>
* What was your favorite subject in high school?  Why?
<BR>
* What were some of the fads and styles among young people you were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a teenager?
<BR>
* What about slang expressions?
<BR>
* Who were some of your heroes during your teenage years? (Singers,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;actors, musicians, political figures, etc.)  What was it about him/her
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that you found especially appealing?
<BR>
* What did you look like at this time?  How did you feel about your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;appearance? Were looks important to you then?
<BR>
* Do you remember any of the songs you used to sing?  Can you sing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;parts of them now, just for fun?  How about a song that our mother
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or father used to sing around the house?
<BR>
* Do you remember your first date?  Your first kiss?
<BR>
* What were other people's attitudes towards sex?
<BR>
* Was there ever a time when you insisted on doing something you felt
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to be important or right despite your parents' wishes?  What is that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;story?
<BR>
<P>Section IV: Youth: College (Conservatory) Years
<BR>
<P>* How did you arrange to pay for your education?
<BR>
* What was your major field of study in college?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
* How long were you in the Latvian army?
<BR>
* What was your closest brush with death?  How did you feel afterward?
<BR>
* What were the events that led up to the Soviets capturing you?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened after that?
<BR>
* Do you ever think about those experiences now?  Do you ever
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have dreams or nightmares about them?
<BR>
* Is there any way you can describe the effects of these war
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;experiences on your later life?
<BR>
* How significant were these experiences to the way your personality
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;developed as you grew older?
<BR>
* Is there anything else you would like to say about those war years?

<BR>
<P>etc.
<BR>
<P>Some background for this project.
<BR>
<P>In 1990, I began a project to record a Graps Family story. This was
<BR>
at a time when the Grapses on each side of the Atlantic had
<BR>
connected after no contact for 45 years, due to the two Latvian
<BR>
Graps brothers (my dad and his brother) being separated during World
<BR>
War II. My Latvian cousin and her husband found us, the USA Grapses,
<BR>
in 1988.
<BR>
<P>When I started my project, my goal was very idealistic- to write to
<BR>
the world about a personal example of the &quot;evils of communism.&quot; My
<BR>
strong libertarian perspective supported this approach and I thought
<BR>
that if  I showed that here is an example of a family being taken
<BR>
apart and changed forever, then I could make a stronger case against
<BR>
communism.
<BR>
<P>However, even though my personal philosophy has remained the same,
<BR>
my goals changed, through the process of interviewing my dad and
<BR>
uncle.
<BR>
<P>My dad and my uncle Igors have so much appreciated this project --
<BR>
because through it, they have the means to to learn more things
<BR>
about each other.  They lost all of their middle-age years to be
<BR>
brothers with each other, and are now in their 70s. These
<BR>
discussions help them to learn what happened with the other one
<BR>
during those 45 years that they were not in contact with each other.
<BR>
<P>And I love hearing their stories! My life is richer for having this
<BR>
extra knowledge.
<BR>
<P>Here a little gem, that I discovered amongst my uncle's stories.
<BR>
<P>When the war ended, my uncle's small Latvian troop was sent to
<BR>
Siberia, with the hundreds of thousands of other Baltic people in
<BR>
1945. A short time before he arrived, a Polish musician group left
<BR>
that camp in Siberia. The Soviet soldiers missed their music,
<BR>
therefore, when the new batch of refugees and prisoners poured into
<BR>
the camps, the Soviets looked around for some musicians to replace
<BR>
the other musicians that had left.  My uncle is a professional
<BR>
musician. His captured troup were a small group of Latvian boys
<BR>
playing music for the Latvian army. When the Soviet soldiers
<BR>
discovered that they had amongst their prisoners some people that
<BR>
could play the music that they were looking for, uncle Igors and his
<BR>
pals were singled out, fed enough food (barely) so that they would
<BR>
not die of starvation, given paper tuxedos to wear as a &quot;front&quot; so
<BR>
they would look respectable while they played music, and told to
<BR>
play music. And so he played music in Siberia for one year, before
<BR>
they let him go. Probably his musical vocation saved his life.
<BR>
<P>BTW: If you are interested in Latvia, here I show some things about
<BR>
the country and the people and the language:

<BR>
pages)
<BR>
<P>My Family History project continues. I many years still to cover.
<BR>
And I have to thank Robert for reminding me of my old project.
<BR>
<P>---------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
Suggestion 2: Go _with_ your subject to a place of their youth.
<BR>
---------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Your family member or loved one can show and explain much more of
<BR>
who they are, during yor recording efforts, if they are with you
<BR>
when you visit a place of their youth, than if you choose to visit
<BR>
the same place on your own. It's perhaps obvious, but I wanted to
<BR>
mention it.
<BR>
<P><P>------------------------------------------------
<BR>
Suggestion 3: What does it feel like to be ME?
<BR>
------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Here is a suggestion that cuts directly to the matter of who and
<BR>
what we think we are, and to record it.
<BR>
<P>Write down the anwer to this question:
<BR>
<P>What does it feel like to be me? What is it that makes me want to
<BR>
get out of bed every morning? Why do I want to live? (or what makes
<BR>
me _not_ want to kill myself?)
<BR>
<P>You may find it an intense and emotional experience to write
<BR>
about yourself in that way. And you may wish to periodically
<BR>
record the answer to that question, in order to see your own
<BR>
evolution over the years.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Have fun recording.
<BR>
<P>Amara
