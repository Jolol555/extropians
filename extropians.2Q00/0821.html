<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you remove OPEC, bad things happen:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Firstly, the price of oil crashes. Each oil producer in the middle east 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; will start pumping like crazy in an attempt to maximize revenue, because 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone will be trying to undercut their neighbour and when you cut your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; prices you have to make it up on volume.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Outstanding. This is NOT a bad thing. This is a very good thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In dealing with a finite resource?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You gotta be joking.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are making the infounded assumpution that it is a finite or
<BR>
practically finite resources. This is an incorrect assumption.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There won't be a shortage, this is bull. The market will finally meet the demand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at a market determined price, not a producer determined price. If the british
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; oil unions go out of work, well, I won't cry for them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There ain't no such animals; just high-tech companies that specialise in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extracting oil from under half a mile of frigid and turbulent ocean.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Good, so answer my other point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Basically, prices will yo-yo violently. The whole process will be aggravated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; by the diminishing reserves -- wildly fluctuating prices will discourage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; oil companies from exploring for new fields, too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Fine. We already have plenty of fields as it is, most of which are not being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; explored only because of governments setting these areas aside in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; maintain an artificially high oil price.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Check out last year's Scientific American run -- there was a rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worrying feature in it (by some geologists specialising in petrochemical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prospecting) who pointed out that the official figures for known reserves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been gerrymandered by governments (yeah, OPEC members) for political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasons relating to their OPEC-assigned extraction quotas. Basically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they moved a lot of stuff that was officially off the books onto the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; books in the last decade, in order to justify increasing their output
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at a time of diminishing prices.  The actual undetected but retrievable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reserves are believed to be pretty small -- nobody is too interested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in oil fields where the energy cost to extract a barrel exceeds the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; product. By their estimate, we pass the 50% exploitation level some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time between 2005 and 2010, and from there on out oil prices _will_
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; climb as the accessible reserves are worked out and the only new fields
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coming on-stream are highly inconvenient (e.g. the Atlantic fields).
</EM><BR>
<P>There's the Atlantic fields, theres the whole north slope of Alaska and
<BR>
the Yukon, there's a huge amount in Russia and Khazakstan. beyond that,
<BR>
we have the hydrate deposits all over the world which at the very least
<BR>
are twice the amount of oil. Moreover, if prices stay at the level they
<BR>
are now, there are thousands of wells in Texas that are now profitable
<BR>
again, and exploration in the Tex-La. region is profitable again. I've
<BR>
got a freind who is retapping old retired and abandonded wells down by
<BR>
the gulf coast now and he's pulling 50% annual returns out of his
<BR>
operations for his investors, all of which is tax free....
<BR>
<P>the 50% exploitation level was only describing reserves that were
<BR>
recoverable at a profitable level at the then market price of $10.00 per
<BR>
barrel. This is the oldest trick in the tree hugger book. Now that the
<BR>
oil prices are up in the $25-30 range, the date of 50% exploitation is
<BR>
somewhere between 2050 and 2100 (we're not totally sure because we don't
<BR>
know of all reserves that are capable of being recovered profitably at
<BR>
that level).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Encouraging people to think that oil is cheap and will remain so in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perpetuity is a Bad Thing(TM) in terms of long term collective self-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interest; we need to be able to migrate from an oil-burning civilization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to something more efficient and sustainable, and cheap oil encourages us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to stay fat and lazy and not bother doing things like developing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nuclear or renewable energy sources. By the time the oil price begins
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; climbing steeply because the oil is running low, there may not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough money around to begin such a large-scale conversion without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; widespread economic dislocation.
</EM><BR>
<P>If we assume that nanotech will become popularly feasible by 2050, then
<BR>
so long as oil reserves last until then, we are fine. Oil reserves only
<BR>
need to last until nanotech arrives, at which point the nanites can live
<BR>
off of the organic compounds in dirt for their energy needs. There is a
<BR>
significant amount of organic compounds in dirt that are not refinable
<BR>
at this point in time. So long as we can afford rising prices in oil
<BR>
thanks to increased economic productivity from computerization and
<BR>
automation of manufacturing, then we will be fine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I _hope_ I'm wrong about this, but I really don't want to see unhampered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deflationary price wars in the oil industry end up forcing us back into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the nineteenth century by the mid-twenty-first.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is an unreasonable fear. They won't cut prices to the point of
<BR>
losing money. They will raise prices to meet the increasing cost of
<BR>
recovery if and when that arrives. We will continue to become more
<BR>
energy efficient (we cut our per dollar of GDP output consumption of oil
<BR>
by some 30% between 1980 and 1995, which is partly why energy prices
<BR>
were so low), and more efficient at use of other resources. Another part
<BR>
of the spike in prices is due to the fact that a number of nuke plants
<BR>
were retired as of january 1 2000, and the replacement generators burned
<BR>
oil or oil derivatives, increasing demand that was not accounted for
<BR>
properly. Some hydropower dams have been retired as well. I think that
<BR>
once prices increase to a $35-40 dollar range that we will see more nuke
<BR>
plants being built (as nuclear will be profitable again), and
<BR>
solar/wind/ocean energy sources will become profitable alternatives as
<BR>
well.
