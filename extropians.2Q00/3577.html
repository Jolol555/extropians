<EM>&gt; population of mutation functions in a machine language (say, x86),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screening the result for obvious nonviability (memory access out of

<EM>&gt; (though some seem to take some sweeps at it -- see crashme utility),

<EM>&gt; so we have to do in a virtual machine like Bochs). We thus have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population of mutation functions, which are being invoked to operate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upon other members of the population.  Clearly, there is a lot of
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which bomb. We have no (or, at least, very little) idea of how to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this, so letting the machine solve this part of the task from scratch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is prudent.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dawkins mentions this sort of thing, briefly, in _Climbing Mount
<BR>
Improbable_ under 'Kaleidoscopic Embryology' and the 'Evolution of
<BR>
Evolability.' His example is symmetry: what's good for the left side
<BR>
is generally good for the right side, so evolving a genetic encoding
<BR>
that allows the same variation to express itself on both is a good
<BR>
thing. For instance, if I have two genes controlling the length of my
<BR>
two legs, then a mutation in one will leave me walking round in
<BR>
circles. If, instead, I have one gene controlling both, then my odds
<BR>
of getting something useful a much better. I constrain the space of
<BR>
possibilities and make the search more tractable.
<BR>
<P>In the general case, evolution is a graph search. Each possible
<BR>
individual is a node, and mutations spell out the transition rules. By
<BR>
manipulating the space of transition rules, we transform the search
<BR>
space - we make some points closer together and some further
<BR>
apart. Perhaps more importantly, local maxima can be eradicated
<BR>
since we change the set reachable nodes. (This analysis still
<BR>
holds if we consider crossover operators, every node becoming a
<BR>
population.)
<BR>
<P>Finding transition rules which work more often than random - perhaps
<BR>
by a meta-evolution over mutation operators - is formally identical to
<BR>
developing a heuristic. The really exciting thing is that you don't
<BR>
have to stop at meta-evolution, you can steam on ahead to
<BR>
meta-meta-evolution: you get heuristics, heuristics for developing new
<BR>
heuristics, heuristics for developing heuristics which develop new
<BR>
heuristics, and so forth.
<BR>
<P>In addition to doing a search over mutation operators, as Eugene
<BR>
mentioned, you can also evolve the semantics (the embryology) of
<BR>
genotypes. For example, a point mutation operator which flips a bit
<BR>
somewhere can have any consequence at all, dependant upon the
<BR>
interpretation of the bit it flips. We can then favor representation
<BR>
systems which tend to be mutable in useful ways. This is the notion of
<BR>
'representation as a heuristic.'
<BR>
<P>Take for example a program written in C and a program written in Ada:
<BR>
both are equivalently expressive - they're both equally good notations
<BR>
for Turing machine tapes - but a well-formed Ada program is more
<BR>
likely to do something meaningful than a C program, since type safety
<BR>
is static requirement for valid programs in Ada. Maybe this example
<BR>
isn't convincing - but consider C and a strongly-typed variant: the
<BR>
variant is no less expressive, but contains fewer programs and
<BR>
excludes more dopey ones than it does useful ones. (Heuristically
<BR>
speaking.) There's a connection here to compression and information
<BR>
entropy - we make good ideas short and bad ideas long.
<BR>
<P>Or consider mutations, constrained to well-formed programs, operating
<BR>
on a C program vs. on an assembly program, you're more likely to
<BR>
accomplish something transforming a call to Build_Nest() into
<BR>
Dig_Hole() than JMP 100000 into JMP 200000. There are potential big
<BR>
wins if you can embed semantics in your representation syntax. Function
<BR>
-&gt; Function is far better than Address -&gt; Address. 
<BR>
<P>Combined with some of the learning-as-scientific-discovery and
<BR>
concept-learning-as-represention formation stuff, I think this open up some
<BR>
interesting avenues for research. 
<BR>
<P>Which is all to say, in effect, screw doing it by hand. ;/
