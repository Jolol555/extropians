<EM>&gt; I think some on the list misunderstand how feel about surveillance.  I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think *absolute* surveillance will be needed for the foreseeable future.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are some zones of privacy which should always be held inviolable.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't believe the government or anyone else has a legitimate interest in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such intimacies as the goings on under your bedsheets or while tending to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your various, er, biological needs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You recognize that: &quot;Keeping what you do in public a secret will be almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impossible.&quot;  That in essence is all I have been saying.  The only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance outside of this which I would not have a problem with is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance which is necessary to keep you from doing me harm with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impunity.  For instance, if you are a powerful government official, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should essentially live in fish bowl.  Virtually all your communications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be a matter of public record.  Similarly, if you happen to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possession of a &quot;near-anything&quot; device which you could use to turn my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neighborhood into gray goo, I believe there should be some means of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; determing exactly what you do with it, even if you only use it in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privacy of your home.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's no need to worry.  If I'm in charge, your bedrooms are still safe.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't beleive you for a minute. Notice the qualifier. Only one room on
<BR>
your private property does he want to protect. He wants to end the
<BR>
concept of private property. Disregard for rights of private property is
<BR>
the classic identifier of a communist or socialist. Making oneself sound
<BR>
'reasonable' is the classic hallmark of the closet fascist. &quot;Its for our
<BR>
own good.&quot; &quot;Its for our own protection.&quot; &quot;Its for the children.&quot; He may
<BR>
not be for absolute surveillance, in the way I have demonstrated would
<BR>
be needed numerically. He just wants to make sure you can't fart or
<BR>
sneeze in your whole life without someone else knowing about it. If that
<BR>
isn't absolute tyranny, I don't know what is.
