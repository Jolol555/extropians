<P>
<EM>&gt; Their review of previous studies of circumcision and HIV showed that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; virus is usually passed through the penis and that men who have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumcised are two to eight times less likely to become infected with HIV.
</EM><BR>
<P>These &quot;studies&quot; were totally invalid: they were merely surveys of African
<BR>
males from different cultures comparing infection rates among those who
<BR>
practiced circumcision and those who didn't.  The results they saw could
<BR>
easily be attributed to the cultural differences themselves, not to the
<BR>
circumcision.  The rest is pure speculation.
<BR>
<P>But even if they /were/ valid, they're no excuse for the barbarity of
<BR>
circumcising boys too young to make a rational decsion for themselves.
<BR>
Practitioners of this form of ritual child abuse will stop at nothing
<BR>
to justify the deed by any pseudo-scientific means they can find, and
<BR>
have not always balked at total fabrication either (like the totally
<BR>
false, but still often heard, story that female partners of intact men
<BR>
have higher rates of cervical cancer).
<BR>
<P>I am not one of those who bends over backward for children's rights;
<BR>
I would grant a lot of leeway to parents on many things.  But parents
<BR>
cannot beat a child, starve em, force em into labor, or otherwise
<BR>
physically harm em.  Why, then, do we allow a parent to permanently
<BR>
multilate a child by removing a normal, healthy, functional part of
<BR>
eir body?
<BR>
<P>More information about the fight to end this cruel practice can be
<BR>
found at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.nocirc.org/">http://www.nocirc.org/</A>&gt;.
