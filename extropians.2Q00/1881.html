<P><EM>&gt; Also, I think you are significantly overestimating what it would take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to recreate a few dozen bacteria in various environmental niches to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  accomplish the chemistry required in those niches.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually I'm primarily thinking in terms of getting rid
<BR>
of the millions, perhaps billions, of microbial species
<BR>
already about on this planet.  We have tried to introduce
<BR>
microbial species, and so far they consistently get wiped
<BR>
out by the current residents.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Part of the threat of the system is its complexity.  Every time an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;organism mutates so as to occupy a niche, it may create several more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;niches between itself and its former competitors that may be occupied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by future organisms.  As Susan Powters(sp?) says at some point we have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to &quot;Stop the Madness&quot;, because the ever increasing complexity is what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;may guarantee that something will figure out how to eat us for lunch.
</EM><BR>
<P>Real interesting to see your take on this.  I'm in an
<BR>
ecologically oriented biology department, and they say
<BR>
the same thing about diversity - but they like
<BR>
biodiversity and don't worry much about plagues,
<BR>
so they see it as good!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; A much more realistic option would be basic hygenic measures,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; essentially each person ultrafiltering everything they contact.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Not a bad approach.  Ideally you would want to retrofit it so its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a permanent add-on.  I have my doubts as to whether that could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;done with biotech.  It might require hard nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<P>We can stop current organisms just fine with current technology. (although
<BR>
it would be pretty expensive!)  Both autoclaves and 0.22 micron filters
<BR>
stop anything cellular.  Naturally there will be some leakage, due
<BR>
to Murphy's law and incompetence.  However, we don't have to stop
<BR>
*everything*, we just need to get transmission and spread rates of a
<BR>
novel airborne pathogen down to the point where we can take countermeasures.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Further, the kinds of techniques that could obliterate environmental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; organisms are necessarily related to the techniques that could obliterate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; us, and I'd very much rather such techniques weren't used on a wide scale.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But we already have methods to obliterate us.  The Russians, for example
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have recently asked for a treaty allowed delay in disposing of something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like 40,000 tons worth.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Current biowarfare wouldn't even come close to obliterating us.  Nukes 
<BR>
wouldn't
<BR>
obliterate us, although they might get society.  In either case, though, they
<BR>
don't get used.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You actually may not need to develop machines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that have to run around killing other organisms, you simply have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;retrofit the genomes so they are slightly more efficient, then they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will outcompete the existing organisms.  
</EM><BR>
<P>So far, that's been the hardest part.  The problem is a) every subtle
<BR>
environmental change alters what's most efficient and b) there are
<BR>
so many things out there with so many highly evolved and efficient
<BR>
techniques.  We can't yet even match 2-protein transposable elements.
<BR>
Just yesterday I heard one of the botanists say the world expert on
<BR>
tomato transposons is having to use chemicals for his mutagenesis
<BR>
because he can't make a competent transposon.  (For those not in
<BR>
the know, transposons are much preferred for mutatgenesis as you
<BR>
can use the transposon to locate the desired mutation.  With chemicals
<BR>
or radiation, you have an enormous mapping and sequencing job to
<BR>
find the change that does what you want.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You could also program them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with suicide switches in case they (by some much less than likely to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;occur with current organisms chance) became pathogenic.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's the prospect of some Deep Green, terrorist, hacker, or government
<BR>
installing a back door that gives me the willies.  Eventually, somebody
<BR>
can design a &quot;people-killer&quot; in a skunkworks with the knowledge of
<BR>
super-ribosomes (or whatever), ecological design, and such that a
<BR>
&quot;world clean-up&quot; program would require.  Such a day will come, I know,
<BR>
but I'd prefer to delay it as much as possible to maximize defense 
<BR>
opportunities such as redesign/diversification of humans/transhumans,
<BR>
uploading, space colonization, and the kinds of hygenic measures I 
<BR>
mentioned.
