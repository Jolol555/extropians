Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that circulate postprandially are increasingly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;being recognized as potentially atherogenic. These particles also have been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;shown to cause endothelial dysfunction. We recently demonstrated that acute
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;parenteral administration of folic acid restores endothelial function in vivo
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in patients with increased LDL cholesterol levels. In vitro data suggested
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that this effect could be mediated by a reduction of radical stress. In the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;present study, therefore, we evaluated the effect of an acute oral fat load
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;on both endothelial function and oxygen radical production. Next, we studied
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;whether 2 weeks of pretreatment with 10 mg folic acid PO could prevent these
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fat-induced changes. We conducted a prospective, randomized,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of oral folic acid
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;administration (10 mg/d for 2 weeks) on basal endothelial function as well as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;endothelial function on an acute fat load in 20 healthy volunteers 18 to 33
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;years old. Endothelial function was assessed as flow-mediated dilatation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(FMD). Endothelium-independent dilatation was measured after sublingual
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nitroglycerin spray. Oxygen radical stress was assessed by measurement of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;urinary excretion of the stable radical-damage end product malondialdehyde.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;During administration of placebo, FMD decreased significantly after an acute
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oral fat load, with a median from 10.6% (8.3% to 12.2%) to 5.8% (3.0% to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10.2%), P&lt;0.05. During folic acid administration, FMD was unaffected by a fat
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;load, with a median from 9.6% (7.1% to 12.8%) to 9.9% (7.5% to 14.1%), P=NS.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in malondialdehyde excretion in the urine after fat loading was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;also prevented during folic acid administration (absolute increase after an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;acute fat load during placebo, 0.11+/-0.1 micromol/L versus folic acid,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;0.02+/-0.1 micromol/L, P&lt;0.05). The response to the endothelium-independent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vasodilator nitroglycerin remained unaltered throughout the study.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretreatment with oral folic acid prevents the lipid-induced decrease in FMD
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as well as the lipid-induced increase in urinary radical-damage end products.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these observations were made in healthy volunteers with normal folate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and homocysteine levels, it is suggested that a higher folate intake in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;general population may have vasculoprotective effects.
