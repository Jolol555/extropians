Re: The book: _Paddling My Own Canoe_
<BR>
<P>One of the list members wrote me and asked me if the whole book reads
<BR>
like the quotes that I presented earlier from _Paddling My Own Canoe_
<BR>
because it is pretty powerful writing (I agree with that). So here,
<BR>
a few more words about the book.
<BR>
<P>The author becomes more philosophical towards the later portions of
<BR>
the book, but in my opinion, there are many jewels along the way to
<BR>
grab you and sustain you. There are philosophical paragraphs
<BR>
scattered throughout, but what I found as interesting is her way of
<BR>
presenting something really amazing (to me) as &quot;ordinary&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Here is an example:
<BR>
<P>{begin quote}
<BR>
It is about 3:00 AM. I wake from a dream and hear the seas rising,
<BR>
but something else awakened me. There is a bug in my ear. He crawls
<BR>
across the eardrum, his footfalls sounding and feeling like a branch
<BR>
scraping on a tin roof. I roll off the narrow air mattress onto the
<BR>
bare boards of the bottom bunk and fumble for the flashlight. The
<BR>
bug's antennae are probing. I grope thruogh the plastic bag of
<BR>
miscellany for the bottle of olive oil, tilt my head, pour a
<BR>
teaspoon of oil into the ear, slosh my head around. After two doses
<BR>
he stops squirming, and I tilt oil and bug out onto a towel. It is a
<BR>
small, greasy expiring cockroach. Olive oil is very versatile. I use
<BR>
it to fry fish, clean my face, dress salads, treat sunburn,
<BR>
lubricate zippers -- and drown bugs.
<BR>
{end quote}
<BR>
<P>Basically, the whole book (it's only ~130 pgs) is a monologue. She
<BR>
(Audrey Sutherland) is talking to herself telling what she is thinking
<BR>
when this thing or that thing happened, and how she set about solving each
<BR>
little problem. She is always planning, trying, thinking, researching,
<BR>
improving how to do something. For me it's a book showing thinking for
<BR>
oneself and how to live with grace and humor and courage and diligence
<BR>
and how to solve big problems by breaking them down into manageable pieces.
<BR>
For example: much of her &quot;equipment&quot; she built or devised on her own
<BR>
because there didn't exist the kind of expedition equipment (lightweight,
<BR>
sturdy, waterproof) that she needed at the time. She is also very modest,
<BR>
often chiding herself, and she has a funny sense of humor.
<BR>
<P>{begin quote}
<BR>
I peeled down to the high-topped tennis shoes and clumped off to
<BR>
the river with the dirty dishes. Alone and content among the
<BR>
trees at the water's edge, I stood like Daphne, bewitched there
<BR>
in the forest. Daphne, ha! Where's Apollo, you dirty, salty female?
<BR>
I knelt by the pool and scrubbed, composing a derisive haiku, as did
<BR>
Basho and Issa in Japan long ago.
<BR>
<P>Goddess by the stream
<BR>
Tall, bare, proud ... laughs at dreams, and
<BR>
Squats to wash the pots.
<BR>
{end quote}
<BR>
<P>{begin quote}
<BR>
What I really need is for some scientist to develop a dehydrated
<BR>
or freeze-dried wine. Please forgive such sacrilege, Monsieur Lichine
<BR>
and Mr. Balzer and you other connoisseurs, but I do enjoy wine with
<BR>
my meals, and seven half-bottles, a week's supply, weigh ten
<BR>
pack-sagging pounds. Table wines are twelve percent alcohol and
<BR>
perhaps two percent grape residue. Perfect a dehydration method
<BR>
and I could carry a fifth of that lovely wine, Louis Martini's
<BR>
Moscato Amabile, in a container holding four ounces. Develop further;
<BR>
freeze-dry the alchohol. Then I could buy foil packets of a
<BR>
powdered Beaulieu Cabernet Sauvignon, or, for Franco-oenophiles,
<BR>
a Chateau LaMission Haut Brion, add water, display the packet
<BR>
label with a flourish, and pour with a drip-stopping wrist twist-
<BR>
into a Sierra Club cup. &quot;But listen, Aud&quot;, say my scientific
<BR>
friends. &quot;If you really want concentrated wine, it's already been
<BR>
done. It's called brandy.&quot;
<BR>
{end quote}
<BR>
<P>{begin quote}
<BR>
I had to go back again. To be that terrified of anything,
<BR>
that incompetent, survive by that small a margin - I'd better analyze,
<BR>
practice,then return and do it right.
<BR>
{end quote}
<BR>
<P>This woman was (is? .. I don't know if she is still alive.. she was born
<BR>
in 1921) a single mother, raising 4 children on Oahu and usually working
<BR>
several jobs during the 10-15 years she made her solo trips to the special
<BR>
beach in Moloka'i. She taught her kids to be self-sufficient in the same
<BR>
way as she knew and I thought her pragmatic, optimistic teaching methods
<BR>
fantastic. And her kids humored her and supported &quot;mom&quot; in their various
<BR>
ways when she took her solo trips.
<BR>
<P>Plus, if you want to get a good understanding of the wild animal and
<BR>
plant life in Hawaii, this book is a good description for that too.
<BR>
She describes much of the history and life with liberal use of the
<BR>
Hawaiian names. The Hawaiian words and some nautical terms might distract
<BR>
those that aren't interested, on the other hand, it might motivate
<BR>
others to get a book of pictures and look up some of the Hawaiian
<BR>
references.
<BR>
<P>Probably you can tell that I'm really enamormed  with this book, which
<BR>
is funny considering that it sat unread on my bookshelf for about
<BR>
8 years before I took it off and read it last year!
<BR>
