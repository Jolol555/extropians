It's just like I said; whichever side's view prevailed, the other side would immediately question the integrity, impartiality and or competence of the reviewers.

<P>Consider this hypothetical situation: group A and group B have a dispute.  After the fact, group A is dead, while at some point when they more alive group B was armed with armored tanks and automatic weapons and was in the state of assaulting group A.  The consistency of group A was a set of civilians and group B military.
<BR>
<P>Later some people who are still alive decide to have a simulation and see what they can determine about the facts as they occurred.  Group B runs all aspects of the simulation without oversight, where group B's goal is to show certain things.  What conclusions do you expect to be apparent from group B's simulation?
<BR>
<P>Does your answer change if previously in the course of determination of the facts that group B lied and concealed and destroyed evidence in its possession regarding this course of events?  Assume the evidence would not be destroyed if it bore out group B's case.
<BR>
<P>Hypothetically.
