<EM>&gt;This has been a fascinating exchange, divided so far exactly on gender lines.

<EM>&gt;The women are appalled, and the men don't see what the problem is.

<P>Well just to throw a spanner into the works of that theory, I think
<BR>
Damien and a couple of other men were right, and that it is a
<BR>
misunderstanding. I have not bothered to say this because it has
<BR>
already been said by several people and the whole discussion of the
<BR>
comment is meta discussion, which I happen to think spoils Lists.
<BR>
<P>Oh, and I think that it is usually a mistake to get offended even
<BR>
when people are being boorish. If one can avoid such bad states of
<BR>
mind, by not requiring for one's happiness that someone else (or
<BR>
men in general, say) behave a certain way, that must be a good
<BR>
thing.

<P><EM>&gt;Evolutionary Psychologist: &quot;Yes, but that makes sense because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evolutionary function of conversation was more for men to woo women
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than women to woo men.

<P>Sounds like junk sociobiology to me. 8-)
