<P>
Robert Bradbury pointed to <A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/NanoRev/Ecophagy.html">http://www.foresight.org/NanoRev/Ecophagy.html</A>,
<BR>
a paper by Robert Freitas, author of Nanomedicine, on the gray goo
<BR>
problem.
<BR>
<P>I've looked this paper over and I have a number of concerns.  Before I
<BR>
get into that I should thank the author for providing hard numbers in a
<BR>
debate which has too often been about generalities.  Also I appreciate
<BR>
Robert Bradbury for making the paper available in html form.
<BR>
<P>A minor criticism first: the title of the paper seems unnecessarily
<BR>
opaque: &quot;Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators,
<BR>
with Public Policy Recommendations.&quot;  Here we have two unfamiliar terms,
<BR>
&quot;ecophagy&quot; and &quot;biovorous&quot;.  As far as I know these are coined terms
<BR>
which you will not find in the dictionary or the technical literature
<BR>
(they do seem to have been used in some science fiction computer games).
<BR>
While the meaning of these words can be deduced from the root forms,
<BR>
and &quot;ecophagy&quot; is defined at least indirectly in the introduction, it
<BR>
leaves me with the impression that jargon is being used unnecessarily
<BR>
to add political impact.
<BR>
<P>I've heard of Drexler gloatingly putting up slide after slide of dense
<BR>
equations from Nanosystems, to tweak his earlier critics who complained
<BR>
that Engines lacked technical depth.  I can just imagine the glee with
<BR>
which Foresight presentations will quote the mouthful of a title with
<BR>
which this paper has been burdened.
<BR>
<P>Now to the meat of the paper.  The thrust is that gray goo is not a problem,
<BR>
because we will have ample warning before the goo is close to taking
<BR>
over the biosphere.  The thermal limits seem to be the ones considered
<BR>
most important.  The abstract reads:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum rate of global ecophagy by biovorous self-replicating
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nanorobots is fundamentally restricted by the replicative strategy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employed; by the maximum dispersal velocity of mobile replicators;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by operational energy and chemical element requirements; by the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;homeostatic resistance of biological ecologies to ecophagy; by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ecophagic thermal pollution limits (ETPL);  and most importantly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by our determination and readiness to stop them. Assuming current
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and foreseeable energy-dissipative designs requiring ~100 MJ/kg
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for chemical transformations (most likely for biovorous systems),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ecophagy that proceeds slowly enough to add ~4°C to global
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warming (near the current threshold for immediate climatological
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detection) will require ~20 months to run to completion; faster
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ecophagic devices run hotter, allowing quicker detection by policing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authorities. All ecophagic scenarios examined appear to permit early
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detection by vigilant monitoring, thus enabling rapid deployment
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of effective defensive instrumentalities.
<BR>
<P>I have several problems here.  First, the strategic scenario in which
<BR>
this problem is being discussed is not made clear.  The assumption in
<BR>
the 20 month scenario is that the goo wants to avoid being detected.
<BR>
Well, that is absurd.  It will only take 20 months if the goo expects
<BR>
to take over the biosphere without anyone noticing!  Don't you think
<BR>
someone would notice?  Hey, we just lost New York.  Naw, couldn't be,
<BR>
the global temperature hasn't gone up more than four degrees.
<BR>
<P>Obviously the goo can't help being detected at some point.  The 20 month
<BR>
scenario just doesn't make sense.
<BR>
<P>A more plausible scenario is described where the gray goo grows somewhat
<BR>
faster and the temperature is allowed to rise more: &quot;For example, taking
<BR>
t = 100 sec, TEarth = 300°K, and Ediss ~ 100 MJ/kg, the transition to
<BR>
the ETPL regime occurs when total global nanomass reaches ~5 ×1010 kg,
<BR>
or only 0.001% of total global biomass, and the last ~17 population
<BR>
doublings remain to be completed over a time span of ~2 tlast = 2×10^7
<BR>
sec (~7 months).&quot;  7 months still sounds like quite a bit of warning,
<BR>
although not as generous as 20 months.
<BR>
<P>However even with this scenario, it is sensitive to the efficiency of
<BR>
the goo.  These two scenarios are assuming dissipation of 100 MJ/kg
<BR>
for the conversion.  This is justified with &quot;Drexler [4] estimates
<BR>
that the typical energy dissipation caused by chemical transformations
<BR>
involving carbon-rich materials will be Ediss = (q Dbio) ~ 100 MJ/kg of
<BR>
final product using readily-envisioned irreversible methods in systems
<BR>
where low energy dissipation is not a primary design objective.&quot;  Well,
<BR>
we're assuming the goo is attacking using a stealth method where low
<BR>
energy dissipation is an important design objective.  Hence Drexler's
<BR>
estimate is not very relevant.
<BR>
<P>The paper also suggests that the 100 MJ/kg estimate is appropriate
<BR>
because highly dissipative designs are easier to produce and, given the
<BR>
difficulty of the problem, these are the kinds of gray goo threats most
<BR>
likely to be faced during the early and intermediate years of nanotech.
<BR>
Even if true, the paper has not previously stated that its estimate was
<BR>
only meant to apply to immature nanotech systems.
<BR>
<P>Even terrestrial vegetation is quoted as being able to do better than
<BR>
this figure, dissipating 38 MJ/kg.  The paper is assuming that nanotech
<BR>
will be less capable than biology.  That is not consistent with the usual
<BR>
conservative design assumptions for nanotech.  Drexler and Merkle think
<BR>
that 0.1 MJ/kg is possible in theory.
<BR>
<P>If we assume 10 MJ/kg, modestly better than the biosphere, the 7 month
<BR>
scenario shrinks by a factor of 10 to about 3 weeks, much less time for
<BR>
defense.  And if we ever did reach Drexler's optimum design, things would
<BR>
be over in minutes (as little as 76 seconds from single nanite to total
<BR>
conversion of world biomass, according to one of the more extravagant
<BR>
extrapolations in the paper).
<BR>
<P>Another problem is that the paper's emphasis is on detection.  In several
<BR>
places it seems to assume that this is the hard part of the problem and
<BR>
that actual defense is relatively easy, which is certainly counter to
<BR>
the conventional wisdom:
<BR>
<P>&quot;All ecophagic scenarios examined appear to permit early detection
<BR>
by vigilant monitoring, thus enabling rapid deployment of effective
<BR>
defensive instrumentalities.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Constant ecological surveillance for any evidence of ecophagic activity
<BR>
is an appropriate policing measure to provide adequate early warning to
<BR>
the existence of this threat.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;...giving still more time for defensive instrumentalities to be brought
<BR>
to bear on the situation.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Four related scenarios which may lead indirectly to global ecophagy
<BR>
have been identified and are described below. In all cases, early
<BR>
detection appears feasible with advance preparation, and adequate
<BR>
defenses are readily conceived using molecular nanotechnologies of
<BR>
comparable sophistication.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The last scenario considered goes into the most detail in terms of
<BR>
the strategic issues, laying out the battle lines for a &quot;goodbot vs
<BR>
badbot&quot; war, Drexler's defensive shield idea fleshed out in more detail.
<BR>
Three reasons are given for why the goodbots have an advantage:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Preparation -- defensive agencies can manufacture and position in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advance overwhelming quantities of (ideally, non-self-replicating)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defensive instrumentalities, e.g., goodbots, which can immediately
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be deployed at the first sign of trouble, with minimal additional
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;risk to the environment;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Efficiency -- while badbots must simultaneously replicate and defend
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves against attack (either actively or by maintaining
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stealth), goodbots may concentrate exclusively on attacking badbots
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e.g., because of their large numerical superiority in an early
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deployment) and thus enjoy lower operational overhead and higher
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;efficiency in achieving their purpose, all else equal;  and
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Leverage -- in terms of materials, energy, time and sophistication,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fewer resources are generally required to confine, disable, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroy a complex machine than are required to build or replicate the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same complex machine from scratch (e.g., one small bomb can destroy a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;large bomb-making factory; one small missile can sink a large ship).
<BR>
<P>It's ironic that the standard argument for gray goo advantage, that it can
<BR>
be destructive while the defenders must preserve information, is turned
<BR>
on its head here.  Now it is the gray goo which is struggling to survive
<BR>
and replicate, while the defenders with their numerical superiority can
<BR>
lay waste if necessary in order to destroy an infestation.
<BR>
<P>I'm not the best person to judge the adequacy of these assumptions.
<BR>
We have had extensive discussion here, war-gaming the gray goo scenario,
<BR>
and I think the presentation in the paper is tremendously over-simplified.
<BR>
To the extent that we are lead to conclude that gray goo (excuse me,
<BR>
global ecophagy by biovorous nanoreplicators) is not a serious problem
<BR>
based on the paper's analysis, I think it is highly misleading.
<BR>
<P>Here is what the active shield involves:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, consider the defense of the entire eukaryotic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biosphere. Excluding bacteria assumed to represent about half of global
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biomass and assuming an average eukaryotic cell size of 20 microns,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there are ~3×10^26 eukaryotic cells on Earth.  If each cell is visited
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and examined, on average, about once a year with time spent per cell
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ctime = 100 sec/cell as before, this implies a global examination
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rate of Xcell ~ 10^19 cells/sec and a requirement for Xcellctime ~
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10^21 cell-monitoring nanorobots, representing a total worldwide
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nanomachine volume of ~1000 m^3 of 1-micron nanorobots consuming
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~10 GW (~0.1% total current human global power generation) assuming
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~10 pW/device.  In this surveillance regime, a ~1 mg infestation of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1-micron badbots in a 3 meter wide, 30 meter tall redwood tree (fn ~
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10^-11) is first detected in ~100 millisec -- again, triggering a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prompt corrective response.
<BR>
<P>So here we have nanotech capable of visiting and entering every eukaryotic
<BR>
cell in the world and scanning it for evil nanobots, plus an automated
<BR>
war-fighting response capable of very quickly and safely &quot;correcting&quot;
<BR>
the problem, hopefully without wiping out every human within sight.
<BR>
<P>This is not an early or intermediate level of nanotech development.
<BR>
It would be among the most sophisticated nanotech applications imaginable.
<BR>
By the time such a global system could be designed, developed and put
<BR>
into play, gray goo could have wiped out the world ten times over.
<BR>
There seems to be a fundamental mismatch between the sophistication of
<BR>
the goodbots, who run an active immune system that checks every cell
<BR>
on the planet, and the badbots, who can't manage to operate even as
<BR>
efficiently as green plants.
<BR>
<P>In summary, Robert Freitas does a good job in the quantitative analysis
<BR>
of the limitations faced by gray goo.  But the conclusion that the gray
<BR>
goo problem is readily dealt with is much less convincing.  The paper
<BR>
would be better if it just focused on the numbers, and left the strategic
<BR>
analysis to another day.
<BR>
<P>It also should be much more objective about the seriousness of the gray
<BR>
goo threat.  Foresight seems to have made a political decision to downplay
<BR>
gray goo in the last several years, and this paper unfortunately seems
<BR>
to be consistent with that political position.  Much more work needs
<BR>
to be done before we have a clear picture of the true scope of the gray
<BR>
goo threat.  Robert Freitas has made an important contribution, but we
<BR>
are not yet in position to settle the matter.
