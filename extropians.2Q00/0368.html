<P><EM>&gt; During that time period if you die, your beneficiary will get paid (the cryo

<EM>&gt; longer than 30--and you must pay continuously during those 20-30 years, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AFAIK) your term life insurance is kaput.

<BR>
<EM>&gt; So, then what you want is called whole/universal/flexible life.  This pays a

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, you build equity with whole life. [snip]
</EM><BR>
<P>Randy makes some good points, but I'm not sure the case is cut and dried.
<BR>
I have a large whole life policy, going to my estate.  Separating that
<BR>
into portions that go to the Cryonics org and my estate involves some
<BR>
legal headaches.  If you want to be *really* intelligent about it you
<BR>
want to setup a trust separate from any single Cryonics org that is
<BR>
responsible for managing your resources, potentially moving your body/brain
<BR>
to better organizations, determining when and how you are reanimated,
<BR>
etc. The question is - how do you get an agent to think like you would
<BR>
and make the choices you would logically make, during your &quot;down time&quot;?
<BR>
<P>Now, for me, I still look at term life going directly to the Cryonics
<BR>
org on perhaps 5-10 year &quot;terms&quot; because technologies, risks and benefits
<BR>
change over time.  Sure, getting term life gets more expensive as you
<BR>
get older, but you presumably have comparably more income/wealth to pay
<BR>
for it.  For many people today, if you manage your investments wisely,
<BR>
you may have the option of &quot;buying in&quot; completely to a cryonic suspension
<BR>
with an up-front payment by the time you are middle-aged.  Presumably you
<BR>
should get some kind of discount for this.  At the same time, the
<BR>
&quot;whole life&quot;, insurance company managed investments, are unlikely to
<BR>
generate a &quot;market&quot; return on the investment (due to the conservative
<BR>
strategy of insurance companies and the overhead of the &quot;management&quot;
<BR>
provided by the company).  Term life is cheap because of the very low
<BR>
probability that you will die young.  Whole life is expensive because
<BR>
of the probability that you *will* die.  So to my way of thinking, you
<BR>
buy the cheap insurance when you are young to deal with the possibility
<BR>
of &quot;accidents&quot;, invest your money more wisely and productively than the
<BR>
insurance companies are likely to do and potentially invest in ways that
<BR>
accelerate the technology developments to the degree that you don't
<BR>
need either form of insurance.
