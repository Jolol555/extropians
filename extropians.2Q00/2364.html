Here's some news I got today from one of my congressmen, rep Charlie Bass:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; New Millennium Classrooms Act Puts More Computers in Schools
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am working on legislation that would increase the numbers of computers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; donated to schools and libraries.  The New Millennium Classrooms Act (H.R.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2308) is particularly focused on increasing computer donations to schools
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most in need.  A 1997 study found that public schools have only one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multi-media computer for every 24 students on average.  The ratio is even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greater in schools located in economically distressed areas.  Many times the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computers in the schools are too old for today's software or to access the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Internet at an acceptable speed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The New Millennium Classrooms Act, which I cosponsored this week, would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allow businesses and manufacturers to receive a tax credit equal to 30% of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the retail value of donated computer equipment.  In order to ensure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equipment is up-to-date, the bill limits the donation to computers three
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years of age or less.  The bill will help overcome the digital divide by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; providing computer access to students from lower income families.
</EM><BR>
<P>So it looks like congress at least is trying to encourage a private solution to
<BR>
the problem, rather than trying to fund some big government bureaucracy to do it
<BR>
for far more money...
<BR>
<P>One a more ironic note, here's another excerpt from his message. The wording is
<BR>
loose enough that you'd think he was proposing we end the drug war...:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Increasing Americans Access to Cheaper Drugs from Other Countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I am a cosponsor of legislation to help increase access in America to less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   expensive drugs from other countries.  The Drug Import Fairness Act (H.R.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   3240) is a good first step toward making drugs more affordable.  The bill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to clarify certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   responsibilities of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with respect to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the importation of drugs into the United States.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   There are a number of rules and regulations governing the importation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   drugs.  These rules are intended to ensure quality and safety in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   pharmaceutical products.  There is concern, however, that the FDA is placing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   obstacles in the way of legal drug importation that exceed the intent of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   current law, thereby stifling imports of less expensive drugs to America.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   The Drug Import Fairness Act would prevent the FDA from improperly stopping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the importation of perfectly safe and less expensive drugs by requiring the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   agency to notify an importer of what is wrong with a package the agency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   seeks to block.  This is a good first step to lowering drug prices.  I will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   continue to examine what additional steps can be taken to bring price
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   fairness across borders and otherwise reduce the burden increasing drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   costs are placing on Americans.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, baby, more cheap drugs is what we need, thats for sure...
