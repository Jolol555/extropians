<P><EM>    &gt;If the inside informant had a clearance,  they would risk going
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;to prison for leaking info.
</EM><BR>
<P>And I'll bet that's why he insisted the newspaper not use his name.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Why would  that inside informant do that?
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably because he was ashamed of himself for having any part
<BR>
in such a sham and was trying to make amends.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;those who know do not tell.
</EM><BR>
<P>If so then don't expect me to support the project, I'm not going to buy a pig in a poke.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;In fact I would not expect they would combine  a test of decoy
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;discrimination with a kill vehicle test.  Reason: decoy
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;discrimination can be tested on the deck, in an anechoic chamber.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you really think that's a reasonable position to take? Don't test it even
<BR>
one time, just assure yourself that theoretically it would work in a anechoic
<BR>
chamber sitting in a lab and start spending hundreds of billions of dollars of
<BR>
other people's money.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;If they felt it necessary to do such a test in space, the results would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;highly secret, for obvious reasons
</EM><BR>
<P>The obvious reason is that it doesn't work worth a damn. If there really was a magic
<BR>
gadget that would, in the words of a past dimwitted president &quot;render nuclear weapons
<BR>
obsolete&quot; and if you really wanted to be sure that these bombs would never be used
<BR>
then obviously both sides should know all about it, there should be no secrecy
<BR>
everything should be public knowledge.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Keep in mind that  the results of these tests have convinced those who pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the bills that this technology is worth pursuing.
</EM><BR>
<P>What are you talking about, the taxpayer is paying the bills.
<BR>
<P><EM>       &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>       &gt;&gt;defense will always be more expensive than offence,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Roger that.  I agree.  However, the comparison is irrelevant.
</EM><BR>
<P>You spend 100 billion on a ABM defense, I spend one billion on more
<BR>
rockets, warheads, and decoys and we're both right back where we started.
<BR>
You call that irrelevant?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Name a city, and please  help me estimate its value.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would I want to do that? If defense cost far more than offence, and
<BR>
it does and always will, then a ABM system can't save it and it doesn't
<BR>
matter if the city's value is zero or infinity. Don't misunderstand me, I'm
<BR>
not happy with this situation but that's the way things are.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;For instance, the cost of the lock on your car is much higher than
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the  cost of the tool used to defeat it
</EM><BR>
<P>Not if you count the knowledge and skill on how to use that tool, it takes
<BR>
almost no knowledge or skill for me to use the lock.
<BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;&gt;I'd use FedEx or UPS to deliver my H Bomb,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Roger that.  But before this becomes much greater of a risk, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;need the technology to determine if any given package contains
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;fissionable material, which is actually now doable, with thermal
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;neutron detectors and other technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>Very hard to do, neutrons are not as easy to detect as protons or electrons and
<BR>
they can be shielded.  If somebody put a H Bomb inside a small oil tank you'd never
<BR>
find it. Billions of tons of goods are traded worldwide every year, plenty of opportunity
<BR>
for things to slip through.
<BR>
I don't want to sound too gloom and doom, I was very encouraged when Russia
<BR>
and the USA recently agreed that each would destroy 35 tons of Plutonium.
<BR>
There is still far too much of that crappy element on this small planet but at least
<BR>
now there's 70 tons less. You only need a little over 9 pounds of Plutonium to make
<BR>
a crude nuclear bomb, less if you're clever.
