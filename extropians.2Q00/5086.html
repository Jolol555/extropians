<EM>&gt; Women: &quot;We shouldn't have to explain; if you cared about us the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we are offended should be enough.  Surely you know that it is considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offensive in our society for men to publicly imply that many women are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up to their standards, especially physically.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Men: &quot;But women commonly and publicly say that most men are not up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to their standards of success, wit, aesthetics, intelligence, etc.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Women: &quot;Yes, of course, it is admirable to publicly admire people for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these qualities.  But it is terrible to publicly reject ugly women.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Enough!  If you ever want sex again you'll stop talking about this.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm...maybe this has been my problem.  I, myself, value success, wit,
<BR>
intelligence, et cetera above physical beauty in my companions, yet I am
<BR>
a man.  Whenever I try to date a woman, one of the things I try is to
<BR>
hold an intelligent conversation over a wide range of topics, including
<BR>
some that I estimate the woman knows better than myself - anyone who
<BR>
can't do that, I do not wish to share my life with.  This has rarely
<BR>
failed to dissapoint, among the ones I have dated.  One of them (who I
<BR>
am still friends with) complained, &quot;It's like talking to God.&quot;  Though I
<BR>
am sure she was exaggerating, this type of reaction does get in the way
<BR>
of the type of relationship I sought: stumbling attempts at
<BR>
comprehension are not love.
<BR>
<P>So, is the message I should get from this thread that I should stop
<BR>
looking for intelligence and just adopt the common male practice of
<BR>
judging by looks alone?  Or just that one of the consequences of
<BR>
improving oneself is, eventually, increased difficulty in relating to
<BR>
those who do not?  ^_-
<BR>
<P>(In case you thought I was serious about the first: I choose the second.
<BR>
If I'm going to live forever anyway, why invest that much emotion in one
<BR>
who will die on me instead of looking for a match that won't?)
