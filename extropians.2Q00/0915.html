Seattle Times
<BR>
Sunday April 16,2000 edition
<BR>
<P>By Mark Fineman Los Angeles Times
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portsmouth, dominica - At first glance, there doesn't appear
<BR>
to be much left of Elizabeth Israel.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her leathered and furrowed skin sags from a frail 90-pound
<BR>
frame. She hasn't walked in a couple of years and went blind
<BR>
in November. From time to time, her sentences trail off.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as she greeted a visitor in her simple plywood shack on
<BR>
a recent afternoon, her handshake was firm. Her elegant
<BR>
appearance confirmed what her friends and neighbours say:
<BR>
She insists that her hair and her earrings be just so.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through her neighbours, she reminisced in her native Cocoy
<BR>
dialect about what a &quot;wicked boy&quot; that Adolf Hitler was, about
<BR>
how rocky her only marriage was - coming so late in life, in 1925
<BR>
- and about the three grandsons she has outlived.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, not bad for a women who, according to church records
<BR>
turned 125 in January.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Dominicans beleieve Israel is the world's oldest person.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This nation's Roman Catholic archdiocese issued an official
<BR>
baptismal certificate just in time for Israel's birthday, declaring that
<BR>
she was born Jan. 27,1875. The document confirms an entry a
<BR>
neighbour unearthed in December in a tattered church registry,
<BR>
which recorded Israel's baptism on Jan 30 of that year.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on that certificate, Israel's friends have submitted her
<BR>
name for inclusion in the next edition of the Guiness Book of World
<BR>
Records, which will be out in October. And since Sarah Knauss,
<BR>
the record holder listed in the lastest edition, died Dec 30 at age
<BR>
119 in Allentown, Pa., Israel appears to have a good shot.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of Israel, known to all her neighbours as Ma Pampo,
<BR>
goes beyond record books. It is a tale of roots, human endurance
<BR>
and the lessons that such a long life can teach.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter of a freed slave, Israel worked on a lime and coconut
<BR>
plantation for about 90 years for pennies a day. She retired about 21
<BR>
years ago and lives penniless in a blue clapboard shack. yet she is
<BR>
blessed by the love and charity of her neighbours.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of perspective, in the year the records show Ma Pampo was
<BR>
born, Ulysses Grant was president of the United States and Queen
<BR>
Victoria was on the British throne. The following year, Alexander
<BR>
Graham Bell invented the telephone - a device Ma Pampo never
<BR>
has owned.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has survived two world wars, the island's sometimes violent
<BR>
struggle for independence, a coup and countless uprisings,
<BR>
although her clearest memory is of explosions from offshore naval
<BR>
battles during World War II.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's a no-nonsense women,&quot; said Dominican broadcaster Alexander
<BR>
Bruno. &quot;She's aware of everything. She smiles. She laughs. She tells me
<BR>
everything she's heard on the radio.... She knows who she voted for last
<BR>
month. She knows she's 125.&quot;
