I dwell in many worlds, including some 'celebrity' and 'TV' circles, as well 
<BR>
as various industries (games software, property, media, printing &amp;c). What I 
<BR>
might lack in specialist 'depth' in some areas, I tend to make up for 
<BR>
bybreadth/ bandwidth. My 'people -network' is fairly extensive, (and some of 
<BR>
my friends even more-so) and I have reached a point now that I can sometimes 
<BR>
facilitate various 'matchings' between individuals &amp; ideas, often across 
<BR>
fields, that tend to be very productive.

<P>I am very glad you are here.  I read over your educational achievements and 
<BR>
what you are setting out to do and was very impressed.  I think you will 
<BR>
have a new way of looking at things that will make for a more interesting 
<BR>
extropian list and also further the aims of transhumanism.

I hereby label those web pages as ``new age fluff''. &gt;WHAM!&lt;

<P>Steve, this list can at times be a tough crowd!  I also read over your 
<BR>
website pages and felt there needed to be much more detailed and scientific 
<BR>
information on exactly how 'magick' and hypnosis can lead to moving one's 
<BR>
life in a transhuman direction.  It did come off as being very &quot;new agey.&quot;  
<BR>
Considering your interests and education it should not be a problem for you 
<BR>
to improve the content and I realize you are just getting started.  I do 
<BR>
like how you are trying to find the power and value of ancient systems of 
<BR>
thought and religion.
<BR>
<P>I am a big fan of hypnosis and have a strong interest in bettering my own 
<BR>
life.  Do you sell audio or videotapes for self-hynosis?  I have bought this 
<BR>
type of thing before but never garnered the results I wanted.  I look 
<BR>
forward to learning more from you.  I hope you new ezine really takes off.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
