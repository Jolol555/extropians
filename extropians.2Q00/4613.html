<EM>&gt;And again no offense, but spending your days tending your garden is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exactly helping you get closer to the days of posthumanism.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you need to step back and take a good, long philosophical look
<BR>
at *why* you're an extropian.
<BR>
<P>I tend to lurk more than post here, but if I were to try to sum up
<BR>
extropian values in one sentence, it would be this: to create and
<BR>
harness technology for the purpose of extending the length and
<BR>
improving the quality of human life.
<BR>
<P>That seems to be a noble and practical goal, until one delves deeper
<BR>
and asks: why?
<BR>
<P>The answer is obvious, and can be expressed by saying the same
<BR>
thing in even simpler language: we want to live long, healthy and happy
<BR>
lives.
<BR>
<P>Why do we want to live long?  Because we want to have time to do stuff.
<BR>
Stuff we *like* to do.  That's the &quot;happy&quot; part, and to me that's really
<BR>
the ultimate goal.  We want to be happy *as long as possible*.  That's
<BR>
the &quot;long and healthy&quot; part.  Of course, until such time as life
<BR>
extension techniques become commonplace, an extropian has some overhead
<BR>
to attend to: *creating*, or at least supporting research into, life
<BR>
extension.  But pursuing that goal to the exclusion of all else misses
<BR>
the whole point of the life in the first place, which is to be happy.
<BR>
<P>If Bonnie chooses to spend a substantial chunk of her thousands of
<BR>
future years in this world tending to her garden (because she enjoys
<BR>
it), who are you to claim that she's wasting her time?  If she has
<BR>
enough financial resources to do so, why should she instead hoard her
<BR>
money entirely for the hollow goal of life extension for its own sake?
<BR>
<P>You must also face the sobering fact that you may simply die before
<BR>
life extension techniques become available.  If that's the case,
<BR>
hedging your bets and living life to it's fullest NOW (keeping a
<BR>
watchful eye on, and hopefully supporting, extropian values) is
<BR>
certainly in line with being extropian.
