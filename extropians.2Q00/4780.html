Robin forwards:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;From 1818 to 1905,&quot; writes Karpoff, &quot;35 government and 57
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privately-funded expeditions sought to locate and navigate a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Northwest Passage, discover the North Pole, and make other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant discoveries in arctic regions. Most arctic discoveries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were made by private expeditions. Most tragedies were publicly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; funded. By other measures as well [ship losses, crew deaths, scurvy],
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; publicly-funded expeditions performed poorly.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>It's surprising that private expeditions were so much better even when
<BR>
dealing with what was largely an altruistic and non-commercial activity.
<BR>
Finding the North Pole and much other arctic research does not have
<BR>
commercial value.  Maybe finding a Northwest Passage would, but even
<BR>
then the information would probably not have been kept proprietary.
<BR>
<P>I would think that a non-commercial, altruistic expedition mounted by the
<BR>
private sector would have many of the same problems as one financed by
<BR>
the government.  Since they don't have a commercial stake in the outcome
<BR>
but are just backing the project for PR or perhaps pure science reasons,
<BR>
they wouldn't necessarily be any more careful than the government.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I am wrong and the private expeditions in question did have
<BR>
more of a commercial element?
