<EM>&gt; I've been an on and off member of this list for about three years. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably spend an hour a day looking at all the posts, and have on rare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occasion posted myself. I've noticed that regular posters will often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memorialize the death of someone who deeply influenced them, and so in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same spirit I'd like to honour my dad, Anthony Kenny who died today of
</EM><BR>
heart
<BR>
<EM>&gt; attack at the age of only 58.  My dad introduced me to Science Fiction and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his favourite author was Richard Dawkins and I had been planning to start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talking to him about Transhumanist ideas this Easter when I saw him again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I know he would have been receptive. So I'm just posting this so that
</EM><BR>
at
<BR>
<EM>&gt; least his name appears in the archives of Transhumanist material, if
</EM><BR>
nothing
<BR>
<EM>&gt; else of him is able to live on.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was saddened to hear this.  I feel very sorry for Sean to have lost
<BR>
someone who influenced him in such a positive way.
<BR>
<P>There are so many things, too, we should do.  Though a lot of us --
<BR>
including me -- talk about immortality, face it, we are far from it now.
<BR>
Hence the need to do, rather than talk or put off.
<BR>
<P>One thing to do, which probably all of us should do, since heart disease is
<BR>
a big killer in the US -- I don't know about the UK or elsewhere (Mike
<BR>
Darwin recently posted on how it's growing in India of all places) -- is to
<BR>
eat right, start taking supplements and medication to lower one's risk, do
<BR>
moderate exercise, and to get regular checkups.  I'm not sure if this
<BR>
would've helped Sean's dad, but think of how many people it could save.
<BR>
<P>Death be not proud!
