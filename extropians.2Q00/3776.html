<EM>&gt;I know a lot of us spend time thinking about the future.  Can someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;explain to me what forms wireless ecommerce might take, on a grand scale?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I try to envision shopping on my cell phone or wireless PDA, and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doesn't sound very attractive.  Could this really take over a significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fraction of the purchases I make today?  Presently I buy some things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in stores, and some things online, but I don't very often find myself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;walking around and wanting to buy something online.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hal: The history of predictions of technological projections suggest great 
<BR>
caution, but I do see a potentially sizeable role for wireless ecommerce. 
<BR>
(Disclaimer: I own stock in Qualcomm, and makers of wireless components 
<BR>
including RF Micro Devices and Kopin.) The obvious application already 
<BR>
being used is to check stock prices and short news items. However, look 
<BR>
ahead a few years.
<BR>
<P>We will have broadband wireless access combined with shopbots. You might be 
<BR>
driving down the street when your wireless device (PDA or whatever you want 
<BR>
to call it) notifies you that a new book on a subject of interest to you 
<BR>
has just been added to the stock of a nearby bookshop. Or: It's near a meal 
<BR>
time, and a local restaurant that serves food that fits your preferences 
<BR>
knows that you're driving nearby and sends you a discount e-coupon if you 
<BR>
will come and eat at their establishment. Multiply this by many possible 
<BR>
businesses...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Adding to that the fact that mobile platforms have to be compact, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;therefore the display area is limited, the shopping experience can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;provide much in the way of quality and pleasure.  Looking at the world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;through a window the size of a deck of cards is not going to be an ideal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way to shop for goods, it seems to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah but the display size won't always be so limited. Companies like 
<BR>
Microvision (disclaimer: I own stock in MVIS) intend to give you a display 
<BR>
equivalent to a desktop monitor even if you're using a cellphone or other 
<BR>
handheld device (or clip-on device). 3-D interactive displays won't be far 
<BR>
behind. (Do a search at www.manyworlds.com and you'll find a recent article 
<BR>
called something like &quot;3D Finally Gets Real&quot;.)
