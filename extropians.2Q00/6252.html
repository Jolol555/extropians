<P>
<EM>&gt;I suggest that all three parties apologize to the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for having a heated discussion in the public forum. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree. = )
<BR>
<P><P>Max, who does have a very sincere interest in his work, and a real stake in 
<BR>
how the online presence of 'Extropians' is perceived, made a public rebuttal 
<BR>
to a very accusatory post. This is often called a &quot;poison pen&quot; letter. We, as 
<BR>
a community, were told we were actively practicing a form of racism. Not one 
<BR>
or two, which would be understandable, but all. Sweepingly. 
<BR>
<P>Max, knowing this did not reflect well, and knowing also it was CLEARLY NOT 
<BR>
the views he espoused, did rebut this post calmly, non-reactively but 
<BR>
concisely. If you reread the original response you'll see no hint of anger, 
<BR>
only blatant disbelief and a firm denial of the assertions. 
<BR>
<P>This man holds a Ph.D. in philosophy, teaches philosphy and lectures on 
<BR>
Extropy and pan-rationalism, and does lots of other things I don't even know 
<BR>
about. He certainly knows his field. He is a good debater -- and I might add, 
<BR>
*used to this sort of balderdash* -- but, aware of how damaging slander can 
<BR>
be, he handled it carefully. 
<BR>
<P>Max knows a lot more about argument and rhetoric than I, but I recognize a 
<BR>
good opponent when I see one. If I attacked Extropy  I'd expect nothing less 
<BR>
than a response that was well aimed and targeted. IMHO he was practicing a 
<BR>
good deal of restraint in his riposte.
<BR>
<P>Still, his academic field *is* argument, and his intelligence is trained and 
<BR>
swift, so he can and does triumph over most who challenge him in words. This 
<BR>
is foreseeably frustrating and to his opponents, who are chagrined! For they 
<BR>
do not see themselves as wrong, yet find themselves corrected swiftly, 
<BR>
sensibly and realistically. Publicly.
<BR>
<P>***********
<BR>
Who does not find it odd to attack a group as a whole, and not speak of 
<BR>
individuals who have offended? Who doesn't find a hidden ax to grind in the 
<BR>
way this was presented in the first place? 
<BR>
<P>It is important for all of us that Max More, Ph.D., creator of the Extropy 
<BR>
institute, set the record straight when rumor mongers begin flinging insults 
<BR>
and half-truths that could end up damaging our very reputations, however they 
<BR>
are arrived at. I applaud him not allowing someone to accuse me (and you) of 
<BR>
things we have not done, without at least attempting to correct it for the 
<BR>
record. For the archives. For the web.
<BR>
*************
<BR>
<P>I also stand by Natasha for not allowing someone she does not know to make 
<BR>
weird and discourteous statements about threats from her past boyfriends. Why 
<BR>
wouldn't she be offended? Perhaps if someone said this about your ex, you'd 
<BR>
be more than a little concerned, too, my goodness! I would be completely 
<BR>
baffled if someone I never met suggested my past lovers were out to get them. 
<BR>
I would not research it to find some lost link to Plato, I would seek to 
<BR>
correct it publicly before it became rumor.
<BR>
<P>Who on this list does not find that whole scenario scurrilous and just plain 
<BR>
bizarre? 
<BR>
<P>It speaks volumes about that person who would cast this weird tone upon the 
<BR>
thread, and hopefully it is noted as a very dubious attempt to muddy the pond 
<BR>
of reason, not to clarify it. 
<BR>
<P><P>Abadee-abbadee, That's all' Folks.
