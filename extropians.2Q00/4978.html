This is the exact reason I keep a diary. For those who do not, I cannot
<BR>
recommend anything more highly. A month of life in which you have recorded 
<BR>
your thoughts and the things which have concerned and affected you can be 
<BR>
worth an entire year which you went through without, in my opinion.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>This hit me so hard because I agree with you but still do not keep a diary 
<BR>
as I should.  The closest thing I have is the ExI list!  I am old enough 
<BR>
now(33) that whole periods of years in the past ten years sort of &quot;merge&quot; 
<BR>
while more definitive years when I was younger really stick out in my mind.  
<BR>
I should have made the last ten years more exciting so I would be able to 
<BR>
really remember it... ;)
<BR>
<P>I agree with your &quot;month of journals being better then a year gone 
<BR>
unrecorded&quot; take on things.  I grew up in a religious organization that 
<BR>
stresses the importance of keeping a daily journal.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
Even after just a short while, you begin to become more aware of the
<BR>
processes which shape you. You can probably consider major events and
<BR>
changes in your life, and look at the different ways you thought about
<BR>
things - but I guarantee you would be amazed to look back over some of
<BR>
the inbetween steps you may have forgotten
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>All, so very true.  Keeping a regular journal must give a person perspective 
<BR>
not normally available.  I like the way you describe the advantage it gives.

I used to keep a diary regularly but now find I don't make the time.

<BR>
<P>I like how Max wrote that he doesn't make the time, rather then just does 
<BR>
not have the time. :)  I wonder how journal entries would differ based on 
<BR>
whether one types or orally dictates to a computer??

When I read the stuff I wrote when I was in my early 20's, I'm amazed at how 
<BR>
stable my basic philosophy has been over the years. I'm also amazed at how 
<BR>
my memory of specific events changes over time. In some cases, the change is 
<BR>
due to a new interpretation I give past events as a result of gaining 
<BR>
knowledge I didn't have before. In other cases, I remember certain moments 
<BR>
clearly but separately from the context of daily life in which they were 
<BR>
embedded when they occurred. I've loved being a whole series of slightly 
<BR>
different people, united by this basic philosophy. I sometimes wonder what 
<BR>
it would be like if I could have all these different &quot;selves&quot;--the little 
<BR>
child self, the teenaged self, the young-adult self, etc. in a room with 
<BR>
each other at the same time. I think they'd like each other. I wonder if 
<BR>
anyone has some &quot;selves&quot; that wouldn't get along well with their other 
<BR>
&quot;selves.

<BR>
<P>A few months ago my mother was going through old boxes and found a tape 
<BR>
recording of me at age five.  She had me come over and listen to it; nearly 
<BR>
against my will too!  I was so irritated by my past self for incessant 
<BR>
talking, whining and yelling that I wanted to travel in time and strangle 
<BR>
him Homer Simpson style!  My poor stepfather of the time...
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
Here's one way I use meditation in conjunction with memories of past events. 
<BR>
I've found that there are certain moments in my life that stand out from the 
<BR>
others in that they're brighter and seem to have been experienced from a 
<BR>
state of mind that I'll call transcendent for want of a better word. (I feel 
<BR>
as though I must step carefully here to avoid being misinterpreted as 
<BR>
referring to something supernatural  Unfortunately, our language doesn't 
<BR>
contain words that exactly fit the things I'm trying to describe).
<BR>
<P>The characteristics of this state of mind include a feeling of timelessness, 
<BR>
or being outside of time; profound peace of mind; invulnerability; and great 
<BR>
beauty of an indescribable sort--a beauty that might include, for example, 
<BR>
the &quot;seeing&quot; of radiation above and below the usual range of visible light. 
<BR>
If I sit quietly and let go of my present concerns, I can access these 
<BR>
isolated moments which occurred at different times of my life.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>A transcendent memory of mine occurred in the fifth grade when only at the 
<BR>
persuasion of friends and a teacher did I join the annual school spelling 
<BR>
bee.  As the contest progressed fewer and fewer people remained on the 
<BR>
stage, then it was two and then... I won!  I was in a state of shock as I 
<BR>
was lifted over the shoulders of my classmates and carried in triumph back 
<BR>
to class!  I remember feeling great all the way home and as I got off the 
<BR>
schoolbus.  I sure didn't win state but it felt good to participate.  The 
<BR>
guy who was &quot;supposed&quot; to win was not happy to say the least.
<BR>
<P>What happened there was a small thing but it did show me that sometimes I 
<BR>
can do things which I think I have no chance of accomplishing.  I should 
<BR>
have taken the lesson more to heart in my life.
<BR>
