<EM>&gt; Immigration policy is one area that exposure to well-presented libertarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas has had an effect on my thinking over the last ten years.  I live in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of the most ethnically heterogeneous cities in the US (perhaps in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world) and I see signs of the vitality this &quot;people gumbo&quot; brings to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; community everywhere.  Many of these immigrants in Houston are illegal under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US law.  They all seem to be working hard and contributing to the progress of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the area.  Yes, if we opened the borders entirely we'd probably be swamped by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economic refugees beyond the ability of our infrastructure to respond.  But I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think we could steadily increase the permeability of our borders and still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintain our prosperity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which I'm all for. Maintaining prosperity is the primary benefit of
<BR>
encouraging immigration. The points I've been making though have nothing
<BR>
to do with prosperity, but how immigration without qualification or
<BR>
without indoctcrination/acculturation of some kind, i.e. citizenship
<BR>
courses like we see for legal immigrants, an area attracting immigrants
<BR>
can change the political landscape to the point that a large bloc of
<BR>
immigrant voters can turn a formerly free nation into the same sort of
<BR>
oppressive regeimes those immigrants fled from.
