<EM>&gt; They are certainly many scenes in the movie that do not correspond to hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science, nor to precedence within the movie.  When Trinity shoots the agent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the roof, she says &quot;dodge this&quot;, why does he not?  Well that it did not.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>It actually goes beyond this.  Why do any of the agents bullets ever miss?
<BR>
<P>It seems that the agents have virtually unlimited processing capacity at
<BR>
their disposal but limited bandwidth into the Matrix, less apparently
<BR>
than even the humans.  Clearly the agents aren't a physical part of the
<BR>
Matrix, otherwise they would be able respond almost instantaneously to
<BR>
rapidly changing event streams in the Matrix.  
<BR>
<P>One thing that is clear from the movie, and which may have ramifications
<BR>
in the sequels, is that there seem to be several very large systems in
<BR>
existence with Matrix-class computational abilities, all of which are
<BR>
loosely interconnected.  These systems appear to be quite capable of
<BR>
running one or more AIs.
<BR>
<P>The movie shows a basic human versus machine conflict, but it seems to me
<BR>
that this is only because the movie was written from the perspective of the
<BR>
humans there.  I suspect that the larger picture includes several different
<BR>
players, most of which are not human.  Certain aspects of the plot seem to
<BR>
suggest this, almost to the extent that the humans are pawns in someone
<BR>
else's game.  For example, the humans in aggregate may very well have more
<BR>
aggregate bandwidth into the Matrix than the parties that actually control
<BR>
the Matrix.  An enemy of the current owner of the Matrix may have an
<BR>
interest in helping the humans subvert the Matrix if it has damaging
<BR>
consequences to the owner.
