<EM>&gt; Alston Chase is the author of Playing God in Yellowstone (1986) and In a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dark Wood (1995). He is at work on a book about Theodore Kaczynski.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the fall of 1958 Theodore Kaczynski, a brilliant but vulnerable boy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sixteen, entered Harvard College. There he encountered a prevailing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual atmosphere of anti-technological despair. There, also, he was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deceived into subjecting himself to a series of purposely brutalizing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psychological experiments -- experiments that may have confirmed his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still-forming belief in the evil of science. Was the Unabomber born at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Harvard? A look inside the files
</EM><BR>
<P>That was an interesting article, although I don't think the author really
<BR>
was able to make the case effectively that Kaczynski's path towards
<BR>
violence was set during the psychological experiments that he volunteered
<BR>
for at Harvard.  The experimental situations were intentionally traumatic,
<BR>
but they were somewhat &quot;staged&quot; and it's not clear that they would have
<BR>
had a lasting impact.
<BR>
<P>The Unabomber is a fascinating and perplexing character.  He has come
<BR>
back into relevance recently with Bill Joy's article on the dangers of
<BR>
future technology, where he quotes the Unabomber in a favorable way.
<BR>
But this Atlantic article puts a different twist on his views:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But the truly disturbing aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Kaczynski and his ideas is not that they are so foreign but that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are so familiar. The manifesto is the work of neither a genius nor a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maniac. Except for its call to violence, the ideas it expresses are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfectly ordinary and unoriginal, shared by many Americans. Its pessimism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over the direction of civilization and its rejection of the modern world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are shared especially with the country's most highly educated. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manifesto is, in other words, an academic -- and popular -- cliché. And if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concepts that many of us unreflectively accept can lead a person to commit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; serial murder, what does that say about us? We need to see Kaczynski as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exceptional -- madman or genius -- because the alternative is so much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frightening.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not that surprising that Bill Joy finds much to agree with in
<BR>
the Unabomber Manifesto.  They are both approaching the question from
<BR>
similar philosophical stances and come to much the same conclusion.
<BR>
It may be unusual for a &quot;technologist&quot; to use this liberal/humanitarian
<BR>
perspective, but all we really know about Joy is that he's written some
<BR>
useful software.  My guess is that his personal philosophy has always
<BR>
been more in line with the &quot;intellectuals&quot; who believe that the effects
<BR>
of technology are harmful.  Reading the Atlantic article we are reminded
<BR>
of how pervasive this view was and still is in the liberal arts colleges.
<BR>
<P>The real question is, as the paragraph above says, do these philosophical
<BR>
views, followed to their ultimate conclusion by someone with the courage
<BR>
of his convictions, lead to destructive ends?  I think the answer is, yes,
<BR>
inevitably.  Kaczynski's mail bombs, Joy's call for an end to progress,
<BR>
the violent activism of environmentalists and creationists alike, all
<BR>
are part of the same pattern.  If modern technology is harmful, and if
<BR>
it seduces us onto a path to even greater and more powerful technologies
<BR>
which will produce greater harm, then the only way to force people off
<BR>
this path is by violence.  Technology is too seductive, too attractive
<BR>
for persuasion to succeed.  Inevitably force must be used.
<BR>
<P>Joy may not fully realize this yet.  In calling for the relinquishment
<BR>
of technological progress, he may be adopting the classic liberal view
<BR>
that government enforcement is equivalent to voluntary cooperation
<BR>
by &quot;society&quot;.  If he can get the U.N. to agree to embargo certain
<BR>
technologies, he can look the other way when coercive means are used by
<BR>
the state to punish citizens who dare to dream of bettering their lives
<BR>
through technology.
