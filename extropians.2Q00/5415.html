<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;| Funny, most of the professional developers I have known over the

<EM>&gt;years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;| consider MS/DOS - Windows to be an unbelievable kludge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;First of all, Windows on MS/DOS *was* a kludge, but that hasn't existed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;since 3.1.  All of MS' 32-bit operating systems are *actually* 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;operating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;systems, the DOS infrastructure is *minimal*.  In NT and 2000 DOS is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;non-existent.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Sorry, I work professionally all day on a Win98 system.  A good day is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I only have to reboot 3 to 5 times.  I had a LOT more control with 3.1, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fact.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I use Win 98, 95, and NT systems, and have little problems with them as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;operating systems. MY NT 4.0 systems run for weeks if I want them too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problems I have with windows is not the OS, but the applications.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Many applications do a very very poor job of memory management,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resulting in memory leakage, and the filling of your RAM and swap file
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with garbage to the point that the application crashes, or it causes the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;OS to crash. Applications I've had the most difficulty with are: Word
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Perfect, Netscape, and Ventura. I now avoid WP like the plague, though I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have to use Ventura for my work, and it has gotten better with version 8
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sp 2 than anything previous.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have found that most crashes on Win systems are not due to the OS, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because inexpensive hardware is used. I use intel chips and standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intel motherboards, matrox video cards (S3 Virge is satanspawn), etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You do get what you pay for.
</EM><BR>
<P>Phil replies:  I use PageMaker 6.52 and COREL PhotoPaint 8.369 mostly.  
<BR>
Since the company idiots (management, that is) switched my machine - which 
<BR>
only I normally use - from Win95 to Win98 (over my strenuous warnings and 
<BR>
objections), the crashes initially subsided, then gradually returned to even 
<BR>
more than under '95.  In addition, however, the print spooler in Win '98 has 
<BR>
a known bug that screws up many programs such as print drivers and 
<BR>
PostScript rasterizers.
<BR>
<P>We had used SuperPrint from ZenoGraphics with great happiness for several 
<BR>
years on Win '95, as it far exceeded our expectations for very little money 
<BR>
and in fact delivered a host of capabilities that went way, way beyond just 
<BR>
rasterizing PostScript to our Stylus.  Now we have to literally turn OFF! 
<BR>
both the Stylus and the computer after each print.  ZenoGraphics now makes 
<BR>
their money selling directly to the printer companies, having proved that 
<BR>
they are about 50 times better at doing drivers, and they know about the 
<BR>
problem, but have no plans to fix it.
<BR>
<P>Adobe also knows about the problem, but their only solution is &quot;use the 
<BR>
driver supplied with Windows '98.&quot;  The Win '98 official driver for the 
<BR>
Stylus Pro truly, truly sucks, and it doesn't work with SuperPrint.  
<BR>
GhostScript just doesn't deliver the quality.  We NEED PostScript!  I kept 
<BR>
telling the management - err, I mean idiots - to reinstall '95, but now 
<BR>
they've converted the drives to Fat 32, and there is no going back.  o'well. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So every day, in addition to the crashes and lockups, I have to shut down 
<BR>
and do cold reboots one after another in order to print color.
<BR>
<P>Just another of millions of MS stories in the big city...
