<P>
I posted a message including a question I was pondering:  Are there people
<BR>
who've undergone such radical personality changes that they wouldn't enjoy
<BR>
being with their former selves?
<BR>
<P>Someone posted the response that such people would be known as
<BR>
schizophrenics. (Sorry, I deleted the earlier posts, so I can't reproduce
<BR>
them here).
<BR>
<P>Actually, I was thinking more along the lines of Jean Valjean before and
<BR>
after he stole the coin from the little chimney-sweep.  Would Mssr Madeleine
<BR>
have enjoyed being in the company of Jean Valjean?
<BR>
<P>What if a person had undergone such a radical personality shift that he wold
<BR>
loathe his former self and wish to forget the former self as though it(he?)
<BR>
had never existed?  Was the former self a necessary precursor of the present
<BR>
self?  If so, could loathing the former self be considered the same sort of
<BR>
unpleasant emotion as loathing one's present self?  If it were possible to
<BR>
destroy or alter a portion of the brain so as to entirely eliminate the
<BR>
memory of the earlier self, would this change the present personality of the
<BR>
person?
