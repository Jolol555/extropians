<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt; union workers as in a) high salary for low skill work, b) lots of convoluted, expensive,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt;and time  wasting work rules,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If your opinion of unions is that low then why are you worried that technology will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; render them obsolete; or are you just a fan of incompetence and red tape?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whe a union has a stranglehold on the current industry dominators, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; causes a significant barrier to the entry of new technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt; the turmoil of crashing markets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Oil markets will crash, fusion markets will not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And if fusion markets employ fewer people than the oil markets, you'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a period of high unemployment. When the oil markets crash, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wealth of those invested in oil technologies will evaporate overnight,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reducing the amount of capital on the markets that is available to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invest in new fusion manufacturing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt;will cause large amounts of capital to evaporate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So if an airline, for example, found its fuel bill was now zero that would cause
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; financial difficulty for the company and it would no longer be able to finance expansion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Does that sound right to you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oil companies will not be able to afford to distribute oil that is worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less than the cost of distribution and refinement, so the airlines will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not even be able to get their hands on enough fuel...for a short period
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of time. It will sort itself out in a while. In the meantime, nobody is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flying.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt;Actually, stealth technology *is* being used commercially, even down to the point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt;where you can buy a bra for your car made of stealth material to help protect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt;yourself against radar speed traps.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And if a stealth bra is not worth a few hundred billion dollars what is? Your tax dollars
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at work. What's next, Tang and non stick frying pans?
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>    &gt; Mock all of these consumer products if you want John.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thank you, I believe I will. How much has the government spent to develop
<BR>
stealth technology over the last 20 years? They don't want us to know exactly
<BR>
but it must be clse to 100 billion. What  consumer product do we get from all that?
<BR>
A stealth bra. How could I not mock that, it would certainly take far more willpower
<BR>
than I posess.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;You are getting
<BR>
<EM>&gt; really obviously stubborn about winning your argument.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;         &gt;I don't know the cost of a B-1 bomber (which is not a stealth bomber)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; True, I meant to say a B2 bomber
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;      &gt;but the B-2 bomber  (which is a stealth bomber) costs around $800 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The cost per airplane is about 2 billion, but the military can get very creative with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their accounting when they want good PR, you could probably get a $800 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; figure if you ignored the huge R&amp;D bill (mostly D), but as there are no plans to build
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any more of these white elephants that doesn't seem like good accounting practice to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know where you are getting this figure, as the $800 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figure was one calculated by the opponents of the B-2 to make it look as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expensive as possible (even though that figure includes lots of stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other than just the airplane). I imagine you are cooking this up in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; order to win the argument, as you seem to be acting very stubbornly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obtuse in this thread.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt;A B-2 bomber weighs  over 400,000 lb. which equals 6.4 million ounces. An ounce of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt;gold goes for around $250-300, which  makes the weight of the B-2 in gold equal to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt;about $1.6-1.95 billion,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Sound just about right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt; What it did have to do with technology and productivity is that the change in market demand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt;for grain in the negative to that extent was not foreseen by the farmers, or by the bankers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     &gt;who allowed them to mortgage their farms to buy all the latest and greatest farm equipment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If I've parsed that formidable sentence correctly then foreign governments stopped importing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; food and local government jacked up interest rates so high that farmers could no longer pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their bills and that's technology's fault. Huh?
</EM><BR>
<P><P><P><EM>    &gt; John, you are being WAY obtuse. I don't see how you can fail to
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;get my point.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh I understand what you're saying, and what you're saying is foolish.
<BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;Perhaps you are editing out too much of my writing in your mind
<BR>
<EM>&gt; before you read what I am saying? ;) I will make it nice and simple so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even a child should understand this:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When industries are heavily invested in current technologies to increase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; production, and market demand suddenly drops by a large margin, you will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wind up with many bankrupt companies (whose market value has evaporated)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and many displaced employees. The high enemployment and the loss of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capital value both can cause severe economic turmoil if that industry is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a large enough sector of the economy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the demand for the products of that industry is being taken by a new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industry that uses much more efficient technology to produce new, higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tech products at lower prices, using fewer workers, then the dislocated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; employees of the first industry will not be fully absorbed into the new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generators of wealth.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;I have agreed that over the long run things sort
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;themselves out and we are all for the better in the end, but in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;short term the economy cannot take up the slack caused by these
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;unforeseen paradigm changes,
</EM><BR>
<P>And I have said that any large change in the economy, the climate , the
<BR>
geology, the TV schedule, the stock market, the social structure  or the
<BR>
architecture of a Stealth Bra is bound to be bad for somebody.
<BR>
But to get back to the original argument, the idea that the poverty of the
<BR>
30's was caused by over productivity (not over production, a very
<BR>
different thing), the idea that  the net wealth  in a society  declines because
<BR>
things that people want and use are made too quickly and too well is just loony.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>just as any system that has its point of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; equilibrium shifted suddenly will break up into turmoil and chaos until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it settles into its new equilibrium point.
