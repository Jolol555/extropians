<P><EM>&gt; Tipler's notion is completely additive: if other immortality bids fail,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  his idea might still somehow come thru for us.  I estimate cryonics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  gives you about a 10% chance of resurrection, Tipler adds another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  1% or so, Singularity deciding it likes you: 5%, nanotech/uploading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  about 20%, all other notions including traditional religion, negligible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  So the good news is we have better than a one in three chance of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  indefinite survival, and yes I acknowledge the possiblity I am fooling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  myself.  {8^D  spike
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Personally, I see a lot of wishful thinking in the whole lot. resurrection is 
<BR>
a strange wish to boot!
<BR>
<P>Cryonics is a lark or a gamble at best, and Tipler is utter nonsense since it 
<BR>
is in no way useful or practical. But good news still comes out of even the 
<BR>
most hairbrained ideas *if* it spurs research and desire strong enough to 
<BR>
live &quot;forever&quot;  - and so increases the *quality*, importance, and length of 
<BR>
time we have here.
<BR>
Upwards and onwards.......
