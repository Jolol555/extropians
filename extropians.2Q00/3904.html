<EM>&gt; &gt; The England and Canada murder rates were already low before their gun

<EM>&gt; &gt; crime rates. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Murder rates in England, Canada, and Japan have risen since passing their

<EM>&gt; &gt; gun control laws. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I have read that In England the gun crime rate is up 10.9% after the gun

<EM>&gt; &gt; control law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I do not say (like ancient latins): ³post hoc, propter hoc²
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But this strange relation looks like the prey-predator pattern (Volterra¹s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; equations, Rashevsky¹s patterns).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; I would be interested to see the sources of these statistics, before

<EM>&gt; this is (inevitably) discussed further.

<P><P>He *is* correct; I may be able to dig some sources up if I have the time.

England has a much higher gun crime rate now than it did at the turn of
<BR>
the last century when firearms were virtually unregulated and very popular
<BR>
there.  U.S. &quot;gun culture&quot; is largely derivative of that of the UK,
<BR>
although the UK seems to have forgotten it over the last century.
<BR>
<P>In fact, this is probably the most consistent long-term statistic across
<BR>
all populations.  For any given population, the level of private
<BR>
gun ownership has an inverse relationship to violent crime rates.  While no
<BR>
one can really account for differences in the absolute rates between
<BR>
different populations, that increased private gun ownership decreases
<BR>
violent crime is not seriously contested.  Even though there are lots of
<BR>
theories as to why these differences in populations exist, I find it
<BR>
rather foolish that so many people spend time attacking the validity of
<BR>
the one correlation in this issue that has a very substantial basis.
