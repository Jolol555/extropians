<P>
Tanya,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for this very informative post about cryonics!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view is that the better one is preserved, the sooner they
<BR>
will be fully recovered.  There really can be no hard this one made it
<BR>
and that one didn't.  Tippler, Moravec, and others have theorized
<BR>
about various ways our children will eventually be able to perfectly
<BR>
restore all of us.  You say it is to late for Sasha, but I think we
<BR>
can always hold on to hope, even if it's only a slim hope, that some
<BR>
day, some way, our children will be able to recover all of us.  In our
<BR>
current state of ignorance, can we really ever honestly say absolutely
<BR>
never!?  I don't think so.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I've completely forgotten many things that
<BR>
occured, and many ways that I was, early in my life.  Even if I was
<BR>
perfectly preserved and restored to my current state, this part of me
<BR>
would still be lost and forgotten.  This part of me is now dead.  Is
<BR>
it now to late for this part of me?  Future historians will eternally
<BR>
get better at knowing more about the past, hopefully eventually,
<BR>
including the ability to restore to my consciousness such lost or dead
<BR>
memories and parts of me right?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For Sasha, it is too late, and I will mourn for a long time to come.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;for a long time to come&quot;?  Even if any of us forget him,
<BR>
again, hopefully such memories will be recovered some day.  Until we
<BR>
can completely restore him too, we must forever morn, strive, and
<BR>
never give up hope right?  Why would anyone want to live and strive
<BR>
for something for a billion years anyway, unless it was to finally get
<BR>
the chance to achieve the ability to meet and be with Sasha, and all
<BR>
of our parents, so we can thank them and pay them back for what
<BR>
they've done and for being our literal creators having given us
<BR>
everything we started with right?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't trust it's origins, but I like the Mormon
<BR>
scripture which states:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to their fathers.  If it were not so, the whole earth would be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;utterly wasted.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent Allsop
<BR>
