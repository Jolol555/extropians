Yes, I certainly learn characteristics of plants! And animals.  And many
<BR>
other things. Here are some things I learned today:
<BR>
<P>1.  Guinea fowl are fond of eating green tomatoes and will put forth as much
<BR>
effort to get at them as they will to get at ripe dew berries. This means I
<BR>
either have to kill or contain the guineas or cage the tomatoes. I chose to
<BR>
cage the tomatoes, because my neighbors all lose their gardens to
<BR>
grasshoppers while I don't.  I suspect that the guineas are one of the
<BR>
reasons for this.
<BR>
<P>2.  Javelinas (*Dicotyles tajacu* aka collared peccary) are more effectively
<BR>
deterred from a corn patch by poultry wire than by heavier woven wire such
<BR>
as hog wire. I think this is because the poultry wire tends to cut their
<BR>
noses when they push against it. The javelinas are some of my favorite
<BR>
animals, despite the fact that they sometimes make a mess in the garden and
<BR>
can be dangerous.  Something I learned about them earlier this year is that
<BR>
they will kill for meat and that 2 or more of them will co-operate in making
<BR>
the kill.
<BR>
<P>3. I have to lift and move heavy things from time to time, and since there's
<BR>
usually no one here to help, I have to devise block &amp; tackle systems or
<BR>
rollers or whatever to get the job done. Today I was using cylindrical steel
<BR>
pipes to move a stainless steel tank (72&quot; x 23&quot; x 18&quot;) up a gently sloping
<BR>
hill.  I found that 1.5&quot; diameter pipe worked better than either 3/4&quot; pipe
<BR>
or 2&quot; pipe.  I have to think about this to decide why this would be the
<BR>
case.
<BR>
<P>4.  I've been selectively breeding field corn to come up with a variety
<BR>
suited to my soil and climate.  I live in an area which gets from 30&quot; to 50&quot;
<BR>
of rain annually, but a large portion of the annual rainfall often occurs
<BR>
over a short period of time and runs off. My soil is very sandy.  As a
<BR>
result, I have what you might call a semi-arid situation, despite the
<BR>
relatively high amount of rainfall.  This is the fourth year I've been
<BR>
working on the corn.  About half the stalks have begun to tassel out at a
<BR>
height of only three and a half to four feet.  I've been saving seed from
<BR>
the best ears of corn, regardless of stalk height.  We've had a severe
<BR>
drought for two of the four years I've grown the corn, and a third year
<BR>
which was fairly dry.  I think I may be seeing some adaptation to the
<BR>
climate in the shorter stalks. I'm not sure this should &quot;count&quot; as something
<BR>
new learned, but it's very exciting. I've irrigated very little, and the
<BR>
corn's doing well.
<BR>
<P>5.  Algae will grow in Schedule 40 pvc water pipe.  I would have thought
<BR>
that no sunlight penetrates the pipe.  Surely, there would be very low
<BR>
levels of light.  But there's algae growing in the pipes, enough to slow the
<BR>
flow of the water.
<BR>
<P>6.  I've also been selectively breeding tomato plants, and the first tomato
<BR>
ripened today on one of the plants.  I'd been eager to find out if the
<BR>
tomato's flavor would be as excellent as its appearence, and it was.
<BR>
<P>I'm pretty sure I could think of more things, but my daughter's pestering me
<BR>
to get off the computer and watch a video with her.  Oh Yeah! Here's
<BR>
something else: 7. Turkey vultures lay eggs that are a bit larger than
<BR>
turkey eggs and pale green in color with dark red splotches. Something else
<BR>
I've learned about vultures (but not today) is that they seem to locate
<BR>
their food by smell.

<P>That's very interesting.  What kinds of things do you learn in your
<BR>
garden?  Characteristics of plants?  What five or six things did you
<BR>
learn today, for example?
