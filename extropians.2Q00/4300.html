<P><EM>&gt;I wonder what would happen if you organized a &quot;party/poster&quot; conference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by just having a very large room with dozens of whiteboards, and with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;snacks and chairs distributed throughout.  There would be no official
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;schedule or map, and you'd spend the whole weekend wandering about joining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whatever discussions or presentations formed &quot;spontaneously.&quot;  Any dispute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about what a group talked about in a location would be handled as at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;party, with the option of one group walking away to do what they want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;somewhere else.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>It seems to me that we have already had a variant of this, and now
<BR>
I'm trying to remember how productive it was to the attendants of the
<BR>
parties.
<BR>
<P>Many years ago, in the days of Xanadu, there were parties at the
<BR>
&quot;Big House&quot; (Mark Miller, Terry Stanley, Dean Tribble). You remember
<BR>
the walls in the front rooms that were covered by white boards.
<BR>
Always the white boards were filled, and I remember folks talking
<BR>
and sketching many things during those big parties. I loved those
<BR>
parties, there was a lot of spontaneous activity around, great
<BR>
conversations. Perhaps the &quot;brainstorming&quot; was particularly good
<BR>
because the atmosphere was charged.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure that one can &quot;plan&quot; a brainstorming session with a
<BR>
party. My opinion is that the focus is best placed on the party,
<BR>
with the other &quot;devices&quot; (white boards, etc) available to those
<BR>
that want it.
<BR>
