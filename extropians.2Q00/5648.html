Great conference!  Linda Chamberlain and Ralph Merkle were impressive
<BR>
Co-Chairs, and Ralph was a silver-tongued and humorous MC.  Also,
<BR>
Great roster of speakers. 
<BR>
<P>The location of Asilomar for the conference was unique.  For
<BR>
those of us who lost luggage or needed a cab, a cell phone certainly
<BR>
came in handy.  There was a sighting of a fox, a raccoon, and
<BR>
a deer (non- human animals, that is.)  The vista of the Pacific
<BR>
Ocean was stunning and the location was sparse but welcoming
<BR>
at the same time -- woodsy.  It had previously been a girlscout
<BR>
camp and the conference room itself had been some kind of church.
<BR>
It was very funny because during my talk, I felt like I was standing
<BR>
at the alter with my visual presentation of mythic images and
<BR>
typography.  My panel on &quot;Cracking Myths of Mortality&quot; spent
<BR>
considerable time cracking myths on religion, which was in itself
<BR>
delightful irony.  Most of the discussion revolved around the
<BR>
issue of what to do about extreme life extension and boredom,
<BR>
as well as other timely myth cracking material. Max More, Ralph
<BR>
Merkle and Greg Fahy were *excellent* co-conspirators of myth
<BR>
cracking.
<BR>
<P>I'll put up a URL of the talk, visual presentation and panel
<BR>
info when I can figure out how to html PowerPoint.
