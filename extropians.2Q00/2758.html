<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Morality is not the issue.  Legality is.  They are not synonyms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;That appears (to me) to be exactly what I said.  The lack of synonymity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;*is* the issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not really.  There is nothing requiring you to have the same morals as our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legislators (or anybody else for that matter).  However, you are required to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obey the laws of the land.  Ergo, your desire to be free to &quot;commit a crime
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and get away with it&quot; does not necessarily follow from the fact that your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;ideas of morality are not identical to those of our current lawmakers.&quot;  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other words your desire to be free to &quot;commit a crime and get away with it&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (assuming for the moment that this is in fact your desire) does not suggest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything about your morals, other than the fact that you want to be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commit crime with impunity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>There are immoral laws, there are also unjust laws. Even legal precedent
<BR>
recognises that disobeying unjust laws as a means of protest against
<BR>
those laws cannot be held to the same criminal standard as willfull
<BR>
disobedience. The only crimes, as I recall, that tend to be excepted
<BR>
from this rule are violent crimes, drug crimes, and property crimes.
<BR>
Victimless crimes in general (with the exception of drug crimes) tend to
<BR>
either be spuriously and/or capriciously enforced, if at all. However
<BR>
the idea of leaving such crimes on the books for the proponents of
<BR>
ubiquitous surveillance to prosecute seems criminal in and of itself to
<BR>
me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I presume, from your statements below, that you are not actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;suggesting I avoid my partner until such time as a few ridiculous laws are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;taken off the books.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My opinion regarding the illegality of sodomy has been thoroughly stated and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I take it from your comment that you understand exactly where I'm coming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from on that.  In short the answer is: no, if I were gay I would not refrain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from engaging in homosexual activity with a mutually consenting partner of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my own gender simply because it may be illegal in the state where I live.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Admittedly, that doesn't make it right, moral or legal.  But it's just the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way *I* would handle that situation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but would you complain when the state starts prosecuting people with
<BR>
suiveillance evidence for those crimes? I doubt it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There is nothing to cause the government to differentiate the exceptions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;(and they are different for everybody) from the 'norm.'  There is no place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;on the books where laws are marked as either having or lacking 'moral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;authority.'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Agreed.  And if I choose to violate a law that *for me* lacks sufficient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moral authority to compel my obedience, I would knowingly accept the risks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attendant that illegal behavior, including arrest, prosecution, conviction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and (possibly) incarceration.  Sometimes going with your conscience carries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a steep price, even when you are &quot;right&quot;.  I'm sure Nelson Mandela could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell you all about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But, again, that IMO is not reason enough to deprive the state or the public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the means by which to detect criminal behavior.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, but this is complete bull. If the principle of the criminal
<BR>
justice system is that we would prefer to let ten guilty men go in order
<BR>
to prevent one innocent man from going to prison or being executed, then
<BR>
we cannot allow any surveillance system to be used to more efficiently
<BR>
prosecute people for violating unjust laws. If you feel differently then
<BR>
I am sorry, but you are everything I've said about you.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;When we have succeeded in repealing all the laws
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;which I consider immoral, ask me again about surveilance cameras.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well if we repeal all the laws *you* consider immoral, we would logically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to do the same for everybody.  And before long, there would not remain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a single law on the books.  In that event, who needs surveillance since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every act imaginable is perfectly legal?  Including my coming to your house,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; raping and murdering you and your life partner.  Is that the world you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really want?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, but your reducto ad absurdum doesn't cut it. The only people who
<BR>
would feel that initiating violent crimes are ok are mental defectives,
<BR>
sociopaths/psychopaths. If we got rid of all laws except those against
<BR>
crimes of violence and property crimes, then I think that 99.9 % of the
<BR>
people would be in agreement over this, and that our society would not
<BR>
be noticeably more crime ridden than it is today. It would probably be a
<BR>
lot more peaceful.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;No, that's not what I meant.  However, looking above, I see that I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;semantically inaccurate.  I didn't mean these conversations were actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;illegal, I meant that they could be, in the government's view, 'probable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cause for suspicion.'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Probable cause for suspicion&quot; gives the police no legal right to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything except continue to watch you.  As long as your conduct remains this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; side of illegal, that is all they can *legally* do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;This can be awfully inconvenient even for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;law-abiding citizen--take as an example Steve Jackson Games, who got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;raided by the FBI on suspicion of computer crime for putting out a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cyberpunk game.  Just because an action is legal doesn't mean a recording
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of it, especially out of context, can't get one into trouble.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The recording of legal activity will (most times) not get you convicted, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even prosecuted.  If I recall correctly Steve Jackson Games was eventually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cleared and I believe he sued and was compensated somewhat for his trouble.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can't argue with you about the inconvenience that innocent citizens can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sometimes be subject to.  But the right to convenience was never promised to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, it is: search and seizure, as well as the protection against
<BR>
uncompensated takings, and against quartering troops on your property.
<BR>
Having a government camera on my private property is tantamount to
<BR>
quartering a government agent on my property 24 hours a day.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I know what the law is.  I know my rights under it.  I also know of many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cases in which the government has bent the definitions of this law and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ignored these rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I know what the cops can and cannot legally do to me.  But I live in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;New York City area.  I do have a certain security in not being a young
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;black male, but my awareness of actual police behavior makes my trust in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;them less than absolute.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No question.  Cops aren't perfect.  Legislators aren't perfect.  Judges
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't perfect.  Juries aren't perfect.  These are problems.  But, again, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't think the solution lies in hindering the ability of law enforcement to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do their jobs.  Maybe that is the solution, but I don't see it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course you don't. Being a good little pro-government apologist always
<BR>
helps keep the blinders on tight. When government is the problem, making
<BR>
it more able to persecute its citizens is NOT a solution.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;current technological capacity, no one can be called lazy merely for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;having missed some bandwidth.  You, for example, seem to have placed a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;great deal of emphasis on keeping up with legal policy.  This is to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;commended.  However, one of the trade-offs seems to have been your missing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;information concerning times when law-abiding people have managed to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in trouble with the law, in spite of not actually having broken it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have never denied that this is an unfortunate fact of life.  As long as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our law enforcement duties are carried out by imperfect humans it is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem we will have to live with.  However, again, I don't think the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solution to the problem lies in tying the hands of those we have entrusted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to carry out the laws.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are already plenty of laws that tie the hands of our law
<BR>
enforcement people. Miranda for instance, and all the rights within
<BR>
Miranda. Jury nullification (which the ABA has been trying to wipe out
<BR>
for nigh on a century or more).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please don't misunderstand me.  I did not mean at all to imply that you were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ignorant or cowering.  To the extent my wording led you to believe otherwise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I sincerely apologize (God knows I don't need another flame war on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issue).  But if, in your opinion, the government cannot be entrusted with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the responsibiliy to observe its citizens, then in effect, your position is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the government cannot be entrusted to enforce the law.  Perhaps this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; true.  But if not the government, then who?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ourselves. There are numerous court cases at the SCOTUS level that
<BR>
recognise that nobody has the right to personally protection from
<BR>
police, that the police don't have the authority to do so. Ubiquitous
<BR>
surveillance fits under this umbrella, IMHO, and should not be allowed.
<BR>
Its not surprising that the cities that are installing these cameras now
<BR>
have the worst record for human and civil rights...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know as much as anybody else that our government is not perfect.  I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that innocent people sometimes get arrested, even convicted, sometimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; executed.  I know that some cops are incompetent and even malicious.  But,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; again, I don't see how forcing the police to wear blind folds constitutes a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solution to any of those problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats what a lot of people said about miranda and a host of other
<BR>
constitutional protections for the accused. Even the police beleive they
<BR>
need miranda, so your argument has little merit.
