<EM>&gt; Really! People, I understand outrage and grief the senseless loss of someone 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you care about and wishing they had preserved their body in hope of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reanimating him. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But to demand that another person do it to save you pain?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That isn't right.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have an odd definition of &quot;demand&quot;.  What we've done is morely
<BR>
point out to Eli mistakes in his argument: one, that as Michael
<BR>
points out correcty, he doesn't get a vote in deciding how &quot;important&quot;
<BR>
he is to the world--the world does.  Second, while none of us would
<BR>
deny him his freedom of choice, those choices do have consequences
<BR>
for others--and not just emotional pain, but likely longer term real
<BR>
affects of the absence of his mind and voice.
<BR>
<P>Certainly Eli has a right to make that decision for himself; but he's
<BR>
the one who chose to justify it by denying that it affected others, and
<BR>
in that he is mistaken.
<BR>
