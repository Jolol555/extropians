<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike I think you were too hard on Zero, tho.  I know that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; he did publish his first and last name on the list last time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; we went thru this particular memefest, actually I think he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; did so at least twice before.   {8-]  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The last time we went at this, I gave my full name and info as above. He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;said his first name was Michael, but did not indicate that Powers was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;his real last name, nor did he, or has he now, matched my openness with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a similar level of information. That reluctance to reciprocate indicates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that he does not pratice what he preaches. He IS a hypocrite. I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;calling him on this. Hypocrisy IS a cardinal sin of the rules of debate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Walk the walk if you are gonna talk the talk.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I had said &quot;hey, everybody on this list, I think we should all post our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; names, addresses and phone numbers.  You all go first, then I'll do so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also.&quot;  And then if I refused to do so, *that* would be hypocritical.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is not even close to what I have said.
</EM><BR>
<P>A large number of use HAVE done so. There are several directories of
<BR>
transhumanists and extropians, Romana Machado's for example, where many
<BR>
list members are registered and give personal info and even pictures. I
<BR>
have done so. You have not. I wonder why that is.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What I *have* said is that I think a transparent society will eventually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become necessary, and moreover, I think it will be a good thing. 
</EM><BR>
<P>yet you hypocritically don't feel that way when you talk to your kids
<BR>
disclosing personal information over the web.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My refusal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to give *you* my personal information does not contradict anything I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said.  You and I exchanging personal information over the internet does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *not* a transparent society make.  It is simply a couple of idiots exposing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves in public.  Your &quot;walk the walk, talk the talk&quot; nonsense is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clearly just a &quot;dummy's dare&quot; to expose myself as you have done, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply decline that invitation.  That does not make me a hypocrite, a coward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or a fascist.
</EM><BR>
<P>How is an open society acheived without voluntary action? What you are
<BR>
essentially saying is that you are calling for us, by your opinions, to
<BR>
all jump off a cliff, and you are promising that you are right behind
<BR>
us. Real leaders lead from the front. Only cowards lead from the rear.
<BR>
<P>SO:
<BR>
A) Orwell's idea of fascism matches with your opinions better than any
<BR>
other I've seen. I doubt there are many people who disagree with
<BR>
Orwell's definition of fascism.
<BR>
B) You have proven your hypocirsy.
<BR>
C) You are unwilling to lead fromt he front.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Your honor, you cannot fail to return a guilty verdict on all charges.&quot;
