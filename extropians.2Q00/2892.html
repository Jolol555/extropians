<P>&lt;&lt; But I also feel there needs to be some
<BR>
&nbsp;technically-mediated way for a person finding himself or herself in such
<BR>
&nbsp;wretchedness to step back for a while, allow the passage of time to do its
<BR>
&nbsp;healing (as it does, I know). Perhaps there are available drugs that do
<BR>
&nbsp;this without making you stupid and numb. I don't know of any, but then I'm
<BR>
&nbsp;fairly ignorant of psychopharmacology. Anyone here have anything to add to
<BR>
&nbsp;my blurry suggestion?

Just the regular seratonin re-uptake inhibitors such as Paxil and Prozac, as 
<BR>
well as another pharm known as Zoloft.  Some people take their own lives when 
<BR>
hit with drastic news, especially if they are young. Elderly suicides tend to 
<BR>
be about the loss of status, power, and especially, physical capability.  In 
<BR>
each situation, if that Is the case, then it frequently is very difficult for 
<BR>
the family. Especially if the person seemed 'ok' prior to taking their life. 
<BR>
<P>One additional thing, if a person becomes depressed-suicidal they probably 
<BR>
have also lost the ability to gain perceptive, so frequently getting someone 
<BR>
to seek help is critical. Final thought. I am not sure the R word should be 
<BR>
ignored in this case. I am NOT peddling R, but sometimes the chemical balance 
<BR>
of the brain can be modified, somewhat, by R. Hell! create your own R, right 
<BR>
in the Bath Tub! Brew it up. Whatever works-or flush it down the toy toy if 
<BR>
you want. The main thing I am trying to say is the Despair is a lousy 
<BR>
companion, we need to fight it, with medicine, cryonics, whatever! Best to 
<BR>
Sasha's Family
