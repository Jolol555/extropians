Harvey Newstrom wrore:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Agreed.  I'm not trying to say that these were all deliberate.  I'm saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that there is enough suspicion to warrant an investigation.  I am also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to dispel the idea that there is no basis for the government's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investigation and that it is all a political plot.  People on this list
</EM><BR>
seem
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to see political conspiracies everywhere.  Sometimes, things really are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply as they appear.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I can't speak for anyone else, but I don't see a conspiracy. I just
<BR>
think that modern anti-trust law is an inherently bad idea, because the
<BR>
government's interventions in the market generally do far more harm than the
<BR>
(limited, temporary) monopolies that can occur in a free market. The current
<BR>
fiasco with Microsoft is just one more round in a long, sad story.
<BR>
<P>I also think that as technology develops and the economy grows it becomes
<BR>
progressively more and more difficult for a harmful monopoly on any product
<BR>
to exist (because there are more substitute products, more potential
<BR>
competitors, fewer bottlenecks in the supply of natural resources, and more
<BR>
chances for new discoveries to overturn the established order in an
<BR>
industry). In the 19th century anti-trust laws were probably a bad idea, but
<BR>
you could argue it either way. Today it is hard to see how anyone who really
<BR>
understands how markets work could even make a serious argument for them -
<BR>
unless, of course, they reject free markets in favor of some kind of
<BR>
socialized pseudo-competition.
<BR>
<P>That, IMO, is what the government anti-trust folks have done. The Microsoft
<BR>
case isn't about protecting consumers from exploitative monopolies. Its
<BR>
about protecting businesses from competition, at the expense of the
<BR>
customers.
