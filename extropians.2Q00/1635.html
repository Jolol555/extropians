<P>
Hi transhumans (also to posthumans, extropians &amp; neohumans e-lists).
<BR>
<P>What do you think of  the World transhumanist Association ..... ?
<BR>
I think their magazine at www.transhumanism.com is OK, and possibly
<BR>
important, but a bit &quot;flat.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Maybe that is cos I don't have their blind faith in science and technology
<BR>
to 'solve' everything ....  I am partly a product of the Human potential
<BR>
resources movement (Surrey Univ. Psych. dept. in the '80s) and soft sciences
<BR>
(plus neural computation (nets) MSc along the way). Although I pay my subs
<BR>
to the BPS (british psychological establishment) and teach sometimes, my
<BR>
relationship with conventionalist academia (particularly philosophers) is
<BR>
often very strained.
<BR>
<P>My links with the world occult frat/sors (OTO &amp; GD temples, wicce &amp;c) are
<BR>
stronger and wider than just about anyone else in the 'posthuman firmament'
<BR>
(or outside of it) that I am aware of......  My anti-supernaturalist natural
<BR>
magick views are contentious amongst gnostics &amp; mainstream occultism, for
<BR>
NOT 'believing' in ghosts, goblins, gods &amp;c. ..... and my natural magick
<BR>
views (MVT et al) are unpopular amongst conventionalist scientists for even
<BR>
deigning to entertain WMT ideas and use ceremony and ritual magick &amp;c (NOT
<BR>
empirical enuff).
<BR>
<P>Distinctions, such as between science and magick,  are mere human-been
<BR>
'made-up-words' and belief-bubbles of different sizes and colours, and are
<BR>
swiftly becoming eroded, merged or burst (Chaos magic, chaos mathematicks,
<BR>
ghostly machines, &amp;c.).
<BR>
<P>'Singularity' seems to be a current hype nonsense word (used to mean
<BR>
different things  in different fileds) .. but seems much as Leibnitzian
<BR>
&quot;monads&quot; ..... and of course John Dee's hieroglyphic interpretation of
<BR>
&quot;monad.&quot; Nothing much has changed in some debates .....
<BR>
<P>I dwell in many worlds, including some 'celebrity' and 'TV' circles, as well
<BR>
as various industries (games software, property, media, printing &amp;c). What I
<BR>
might lack in specialist 'depth' in some areas, I tend to make up for by
<BR>
breadth/ bandwidth. My 'people -network' is fairly extensive, (and some of
<BR>
my friends even more-so) and I have reached a point now that I can sometimes
<BR>
facilitate various 'matchings' between individuals &amp;  ideas, often across
<BR>
fields, that tend to be very productive.
<BR>
<P>The WTA magazine caters for scientists and the serious minded .... but is
<BR>
too much like an academic publication for my tastes, and for many who might
<BR>
otherwise be drawn towards the post/trans/x-human community.
<BR>
<P>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
<BR>
<P>So (finally getting to the point) ..... I am setting up an e-zine to help
<BR>
draw together the various strands of post-humanism ... with the intention of
<BR>
making our radical futurist agenda more accessible to more people (and to
<BR>
provide better communication between various cliques and factions).
<BR>
<P>Anybody who wants to help out with this project (www.x-human.com
<BR>
www.neohuman.com
<BR>
www.extropia.net   www.trans-human    www.post-human.com) who can either
<BR>
post stuff for inclusion to the zine (I will set it up with discussion-web
<BR>
facilities) ......  or maybe help by promoting it far and wide  ..... please
<BR>
e-mail me <A HREF="mailto:steve@multisell.com?Subject=Re:%20Extropia&In-Reply-To=&lt;000d01bfafd3$39fceae0$8de731d4@i6x7m6&gt;">steve@multisell.com</A>
<BR>
<P>I want to include video and audio as well as text. Let's try to do something
<BR>
quite flash!
<BR>
<P>Posthuman salute
