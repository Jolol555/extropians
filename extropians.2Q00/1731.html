<EM>&gt; For listeners: approval voting is where each voter gets to vote for as many

<P>I like a modified form of elimination.  We have the technology for it, of
<BR>
course.  Simple elimination is where all the candidates are ranked, then
<BR>
in the first iteration, the candidate with the fewest #1 votes is
<BR>
eliminated, and the other canditates &quot;move up a notch&quot; on the relevant
<BR>
ballots.  This is repeated as many times as there are candidates, minus
<BR>
one.  In a modified version, we could first eliminate outright anyone who
<BR>
fell below a certain low average, and then maybe count #1, #2, and #3
<BR>
votes for the first round or two in a large field.
<BR>
<P>Of course, it's going to be economically irrational for an individual to
<BR>
vote, let alone spend time researching candidates, in any large election.
<BR>
So, while the math/statistics here is intriguing, it doesn't make
<BR>
democracy work.
