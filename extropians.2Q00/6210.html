<EM>&gt;Are you aware how politically correct you sound and how much you sound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like you are trying to launch an inquisition?  If I talked, say, about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trucks, would you even feel the slightest bit interested in my frequent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;comments about trucks (as is the case with EvMick)? Why do you seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;obsess about peoples comments about guns, but not about people's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;frequent comments about art (Natasha or Nadia), gardening (Bonnie), the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;law (Greg Burch), trucks (EvMick), Music or poetry (E Shaun Russell).
</EM><BR>
<P>EvMick, Natasha, Nadia, Bonnie, Greg and Shaun already limit their 
<BR>
postings to relevant topics.  They label their subject lines 
<BR>
appropriately, or change the subject lines when they change the 
<BR>
topic.  All of them have been able to have intelligent conversations 
<BR>
on a variety of subjects without trying to steer every conversation 
<BR>
to a single particular interest.  All their posts on their favorite 
<BR>
topics would not equal a tenth the volume of your gun posts.
<BR>
<P>|It seems as though you have some unreasoning fear of guns,
<BR>
|a hoplophobia.  Perhaps you need to seek counseling...
<BR>
<P>I do not fear guns.  I am bored to death with endless discussions 
<BR>
about guns.  They are simply off-topic most of the time.  If you 
<BR>
would simply discuss guns in a thread about guns, instead of trying 
<BR>
to co-opt everyone else's threads, that would be fine.  I do not 
<BR>
object to your discussion of guns, but at the way you kill other 
<BR>
discussions about other subjects.  You are like a Jesus-freak who 
<BR>
can't talk about anything else, and who thinks everything leads back 
<BR>
to a single topic.
<BR>
<P>I don't mean these words to be unkind.  You are probably the most 
<BR>
intelligent expert on guns I know.  It's just that sometimes we want 
<BR>
to talk about something else.
