&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carnegie Mellon University 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carnegie Mellon brain scientists find human brain applies law of
<BR>
least effort when solving problems 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PITTSBURGH -- Using brain imaging, scientists at Carnegie Mellon
<BR>
University have discovered how the human brain goes to work on solving a
<BR>
problem and how it employs surprising economies of effort in the
<BR>
process.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results, compiled by Psychology post-doctoral research 
<BR>
associate Erik Reichle and Professors Patricia Carpenter and Marcel 
<BR>
Just, all of Carnegie Mellon's Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.ccbi.cmu.edu">http://www.ccbi.cmu.edu</A>), appear in the June issue of Cognitive
<BR>
Psychology.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Carnegie Mellon scientists found that the law of least effort 
<BR>
may apply to the brain. Their results indicate that partially separate
<BR>
networks within the human brain support language and visual-spatial 
<BR>
processing. The Carnegie Mellon findings also suggest that our brains 
<BR>
may seek to minimize the mental workload by choosing the strategy that 
<BR>
makes less work for the brain. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By studying thinking in a simple task that lends itself to either
<BR>
a visual or a verbal solution, the researchers were able to identify 
<BR>
which of two strategies was being used. The findings are based on 
<BR>
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans showing that brain 
<BR>
function associated with a verbal strategy produced relatively more 
<BR>
activation in a network of brain areas specialized for language 
<BR>
processing, prominently including Broca's area, which governs the 
<BR>
ability to talk. The use of a visual strategy shifted the activation 
<BR>
towards a network of brain areas that process visual and spatial 
<BR>
information, particularly the parietal cortex.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The new findings demonstrate that different ways of thinking 
<BR>
engage different networks of brain areas, resulting in identifiable 
<BR>
brain activation patterns in each individual,&quot; Just said. &quot;We can't 
<BR>
quite read a person's mind by watching their brain at work, but we can 
<BR>
reliably tell which way a person is thinking about a problem.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study measured brain activity in college students as they read
<BR>
sentences such as &quot;The star is not above the plus (sign)&quot; and judged
<BR>
whether the sentences were true or false of an accompanying simple 
<BR>
picture. The student participants were instructed on the use of both a 
<BR>
verbal and a visual strategy, and told when to use each one. Comparing 
<BR>
the meaning of a sentence to the content of a picture involves both 
<BR>
verbal and spatial thinking, and the comparison of their meaning can be
<BR>
done in either a verbal or a spatial domain of thought. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Carnegie Mellon team also was surprised that the amount of 
<BR>
brain activation occurring with each strategy depended on how skilled 
<BR>
the participant was in that kind of thinking. Carpenter explained that 
<BR>
more skill was associated with less activation, just as more skill at 
<BR>
something physical like swimming results in less muscle activity to 
<BR>
perform a given task. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Individuals with better verbal skills had less activation in 
<BR>
Broca's area when they used the verbal strategy. Similarly, individuals
<BR>
with better visual-spatial skills had less activation in the left 
<BR>
parietal cortex when they used the visual-spatial strategy,&quot; she added.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These findings tie in with one of the Center for Cognitive Brain
<BR>
Imaging's main goals of using brain imaging to determine not only which
<BR>
parts of the brain are used for this or that task, but to also discover
<BR>
the mental economics that dictate how the organization of brain areas 
<BR>
ends up dealing with a particular thinking task. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the final analysis the brain is a biological system that does 
<BR>
its job by consuming biological resources and providing a service, 
<BR>
namely thinking or information processing,&quot; Just said. &quot;But when there 
<BR>
is a choice of how to provide the service, mental economics may come 
<BR>
into play, with the brain using the method that is less costly for that 
<BR>
individual, namely the one in which he or she is more efficient.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers noted that this finding provides a possible 
<BR>
meeting ground between the brain and the mind -- relating the dynamics 
<BR>
of higher level thinking (in this case understanding of sentences and 
<BR>
pictures) and the dynamics of brain-level activity (how the brain 
<BR>
accomplishes the translation between the two domains of understanding).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because not all brains are alike in their efficiency at a given 
<BR>
task, one of the new directions these results may lead to is in 
<BR>
evaluating which method, verbal or visual, may be more effective for 
<BR>
instruction or communication for a given individual. The new results 
<BR>
show that choice is more than just a matter of taste; it is a matter of 
<BR>
mental efficiency.
