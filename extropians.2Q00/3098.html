<EM>&gt;  Much as doctors would like to, there is no way of cooling just the head. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  must chill the entire body. In all the experiments so far, this is done the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  old-fashioned way. Patients are covered in air-cooled blankets and 
</EM><BR>
sometimes
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  packed in ice or rubbed with alcohol. 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen a device that was tried in the UK by paramedics at RTA's 
<BR>
where a crash helmet type devices was placed on the victims of head trauma, 
<BR>
Then CO2 was pumped through the helmet creating dry ice and rapidly cooling 
<BR>
the patients head.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  However, later this year, doctors will try something entirely new. Human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  studies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  are expected to begin with devices that cool the body from the inside out. 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surely chilled water colonic irigation would have a very similar effect, 
<BR>
this would be less invasive and as the patients blood supply would already be 
<BR>
redirected to the internal organs due to shock, there would be an increased 
<BR>
blood supply the in intestines and colon. Im not sure whether the body would 
<BR>
have a natural defence against this intrusion by drawing the blood supply 
<BR>
away. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  Dr. Myron Ginsberg of the University of Miami noticed that when scientists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  clamped arteries in rats' brains to study the amount of damage that 
</EM><BR>
resulted,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  two experiments ever seemed to turn out the same. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  In time, he figured out why. Slight differences in the temperature of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rats'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  brains, resulting from things like the lab temperature and air currents, 
</EM><BR>
had
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  ahuge impact on the extent of the animals' strokes. The cooler the brain, 
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  turned out, the smaller the stroke. But even a modest drop in temperature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  seemed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to be highly protective, while a little extra heat made things vastly 
</EM><BR>
worse. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would expect there to be some evidence in humans coresponding to this. 
<BR>
There must be some difference in stroke mortality rates between hotter climes 
<BR>
and coutries like Sweden or Siberia. Does anyone know of any such studies ?.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &quot;Two or three degrees of temperature change every biological system known 
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  man, often by 100 percent,&quot; says Dr. Alister Buchon of the University of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Calgary. &quot;We evolved at this temperature. We don't work if we lower it.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Ginsberg says his experiments suggest an ideal target for stroke treatment:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Lower body temperature by about 5 degrees Celsius from the normal 37.5, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the treatment within three or four hours and hold down the temperature for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 24
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  36 hours. 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not longer, considerable damage occurs up to a week after brain 
<BR>
trauma.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Doctors consider this to be mild hypothermia, and they hope patients will 
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  able to stand it while conscious. Possibilities include giving them mild
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sedatives and warming their skin while catheters chill their blood. 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the US army/navy have done much research on the effects of 
<BR>
cold on the body, in particular studies on navy seals. In there tests they 
<BR>
have found that multiple exposures to cold, lowers the bodies internal 
<BR>
temerature for long terms and  takes away the natural defence of shivering
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  However, the cold catheters have never been used on a person, so no one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  reallyknows how the human body will react to having its blood cooled. Some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  speculate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that if the skin stays warm, the brain will be fooled into thinking all is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  balmy. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;It makes sense that some of the body's negative reaction to hypothermia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  wouldpossibly not be seen if the cooling comes from within,&quot; says Connolly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;The body
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  has no defense mechanism against that, because there is no environmental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  equivalent.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonic irrigation. ??
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Many doctors agree that if cooling works, it will have to be done quickly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  before the stroke runs its irreversible course. This will mean starting it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  soon as suspected stroke patients arrive at the emergency room, or perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  before. Some suggest ambulance crews might insert a cooling catheter on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to the hospital. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well if I ever have a stroke, im going to spray a fire extiguisher on my 
<BR>
head, stuff the shower hose up my backside and eat ice until the ambulance 
<BR>
crew arrives. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex.
