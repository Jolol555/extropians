<P>
&nbsp;&quot;Coyote&quot; said:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The only hope is the universe we know is a debug version with symbols, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we can connect an equivalent of a serial cable to this remotely, else we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a retail version, and our only hope is to fdisk.
</EM><BR>
<P>I just learned that the Windows FDISK cannot cope with novel types of
<BR>
partitions created after installing Linux, so it says on the one hand,
<BR>
I cannot delete a partition due to the existence of logical partitions,
<BR>
and on the other hand, that there are no logical partitions to delete!
<BR>
<P>However, that's not what caught my attention. I do find that the reality
<BR>
that we have been taught is a simulacrum, a searching for meaning in
<BR>
an exchange of symbols infinitely regressing without terminal referents.
<BR>
<P>I propose that I have found a set of referents to the common symbols,
<BR>
but it changes the entire nature of what one would socially construct.
<BR>
<P>Here is my personal and web site introduction:
<BR>
<P>I am Glenn Scheper. I am mostly an avid lurker, but sometimes
<BR>
I'll blurt out an heretical opinion upon a thread, and I help
<BR>
anyone who asks to locate web information I might have cached.
<BR>
<P>Having reconstructed my psyche after an acute psychosis,
<BR>
schizophrenia, and manic-depression for several years, I am
<BR>
well positioned to tell a coherent interpretation for the
<BR>
meanings of many universal archetypes that are as yet veiled.
<BR>
I carry out this effort via my personal web site. Won't you
<BR>
please examine it, and share it with others?
<BR>
<P>I walk the line between my completely straight, heterosexual,
<BR>
monogamous lifestyle needs, and the intense personal pleasure
<BR>
of autofellatio, performed during monadic tantric meditations.
<BR>
For marital harmony, I've been suppressing, and converting my
<BR>
monadic libido into early-morning web research and writing upon
<BR>
my insight, that autofellatio is the occult theme of religions.
<BR>
<P>E.g., Here are some sound bytes from my essay:
<BR>
<P>(me:) I particularly enjoyed as a youth stories of King Arthur and the
<BR>
knights of the round table, his sword named Excalibur, and the
<BR>
sorcerer Merlin, which all form a literature derived from mythological
<BR>
figures. Swords seem inevitably to be icons of the phallus. This
<BR>
sword named Excalibur was notable in being named, as autofellatio
<BR>
is naming. It was found piercing a rock, which is a sign for the
<BR>
skull, the head, and could only removed by a magically distinguished
<BR>
person, like the rock cum sword monad distinguished by autofellatio.
<BR>
<P>(KJV:) Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see,
<BR>
I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted
<BR>
a little of this honey.
<BR>
<P>(KJV:) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
<BR>
and the Word was God.
<BR>
<P>(quote:) Indra has his throne in a storm cloud. Indra loves Soma and
<BR>
women beyond anything in the universe - anytime and in vast excess
<BR>
quantities. He can't just take a drink of Soma. He must become
<BR>
falling down drunk (representing earthquakes) and will have liaisons
<BR>
with ANY woman.
<BR>
<P>(quote:) although it's put a bit discreetly, the operative image here
<BR>
would seem to be autofellatio. Ancient Egyptian texts state that
<BR>
the creator god Atum (although in this text the sun god Re is
<BR>
standing in for him), created Shu and Tefnut by spitting, or that
<BR>
he created them by masturbating, but it is unusual to combine
<BR>
the two images. This, in and of itself, invites us to contemplate
<BR>
autofellatio.
<BR>
<P>All this and more, I have just begin to gather, in the 500 Kbyte:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.hughes.net/~scheper/theword.htm">http://www.hughes.net/~scheper/theword.htm</A>
<BR>
The Word of God; The Production of Christ.
<BR>
A radical epistemology sufficient to usher in an epoch:
<BR>
Presents the Word of God as sex-magickal autofellatio.
<BR>
<P>My other major web offerings are:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.hughes.net/~scheper/prophecy.htm">http://www.hughes.net/~scheper/prophecy.htm</A>
<BR>
Biblical Prophecies correlated with Modern Objects
<BR>
Showing that Ezekiel's beasts, lightnings, wings and wheels are
<BR>
an automobile engine. Shows too how the Chornobyl Nuclear Power
<BR>
Plant disaster fulfills Gog and Magog, the Armageddon event.
