<EM>&gt; &gt; Unless you take into account the possibility that he might be innocent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but wrongly convicted. Here in the UK, they've tightened up the appeals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and miscarriages-of-justice process a bit in the past few years, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; added DNA testing to the battery of forensic techniques available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The result is that roughly 10-15% of historic &quot;guilty&quot; verdicts are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; being overturned, in crimes as serious as murder.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem with 'life in prison', is that nobody loses sleep when someone
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; sentenced to it.  There are people who are sentenced to life in prison,
</EM><BR>
because
<BR>
<EM>&gt; they are frustrated by the legal system and resort to blowing away a bad
</EM><BR>
guy.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; There are people sentenced to life on very little evidence.  But nobody
</EM><BR>
cares.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But let a hardened criminal, with a rap sheet a mile long, get
</EM><BR>
sententenced to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; death for killing and torturing a bunch of cute little kids, and all hell
</EM><BR>
breaks
<BR>
<EM>&gt; lose.  A ton of lawyers and activists spring to the rescue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Argh!
</EM><BR>
<P>Shouldn't that make life in prison a stronger deterrent than the death
<BR>
penalty (given that it is more likely to happen)? Maybe the eye for an eye
<BR>
folks should be steering away from the death penalty, to slightly less harsh
<BR>
punishments which carry little or no political baggage.
