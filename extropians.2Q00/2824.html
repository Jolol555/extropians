<P>
I wanted to speak at the wake as well, but I was afraid to, because I
<BR>
--------
<BR>
I, too, felt this way.  I was afraid to speak because I was afraid that
<BR>
I could not do Sasha justice by anything I would say.  I didn't know
<BR>
anyone else there besides the people I came with, despite knowing Sasha
<BR>
for almost 7 years, but always from another city.  Several times I tried
<BR>
to drag myself off the bench, but each time I thought that nothing I
<BR>
could say really mattered at that point, Sasha was gone and anything worth
<BR>
saying should have been said before.  I'm not a particularly warm and open
<BR>
person to begin with, but sharing grief is especially difficult for me.
<BR>
I rarely talk at wakes, I prefer to write about the person and my feelings
<BR>
about them.
<BR>
<P>A number of people expressed guilt.  It is easy to feel guilty, or any
<BR>
other emotion, once it is too late to show it to the person you cared
<BR>
about.  I don't know if I ever really showed Sasha how much I cared about
<BR>
him, I was probably always too busy arguing with him about some technical,
<BR>
political, philosophical, or other random topic, or about the details of
<BR>
some project or other.  He and I had had a bit of a falling-out recently
<BR>
and we were slowly talking through it, it wasn't anything that wouldn't
<BR>
have been worked out, but it wasn't how I wanted to leave things with
<BR>
Sasha when he died - which I hadn't expected for many years to come.  It
<BR>
seemed nothing worse than other disagreements we'd had in the past, but
<BR>
now, when it is useless, it is easy to figure out what I should have said
<BR>
to him sooner.  It would have done nothing more than help me feel less
<BR>
guilty, nothing we had to discuss was anything more than &quot;mild
<BR>
difficulties&quot; as Sasha had put it.  Feeling guilty does nobody any good.
<BR>
Any of his friends feeling guilty or angry will not do Sasha any good, nor
<BR>
themselves.  Now, we can merely miss him.
<BR>
<P>Sasha dead in a box without his bright eyes and wry smile, dormant instead
<BR>
of full of life and energy, made the whole situation seem even more unreal.
<BR>
That couldn't have been Sasha, it only vaguely looked like him, the rest
<BR>
made no sense when compared to the Sasha I knew.  Thus, it seems, the only
<BR>
real Sasha left is the one in our memories.
<BR>
<P>I miss Sasha's voice, too.  If anyone has any audio recordings of his voice,
<BR>
it would be great if they could be posted to the memorial page.  Same with
<BR>
more photos of him smiling.  These will help to jog our memories as they
<BR>
begin to fail with too much time passing, as happens with all things.   Not
<BR>
enough time passed for Sasha, he deserved a lot more.
<BR>
<P><P>Live Long &amp; Prosper,
<BR>
Stephan
