<P>I think Commissioner Gordon just flashed the Bat Signal, so here I am. :-)
<BR>
<P>I agree with Eugene that a coherent memetic cluster needs protection 
<BR>
against erosion. So not everyone who calls themselves &quot;Extropian&quot; will be 
<BR>
using the term reasonably. On the other hand, as I've demonstrated over the 
<BR>
last ten years, the statement of what it means to be extropian does develop 
<BR>
and (I believe) improve over time.
<BR>
<P>I also agree with Brian in what I take to be his main thrust. I appreciate 
<BR>
Brian's stepping up to the plate to defend the integrity of &quot;Extropian&quot;. It 
<BR>
does indeed mean something determinate to be &quot;an Extropian&quot; or to be 
<BR>
&quot;extropian&quot;. However, I am not comfortable with the image of drawing a 
<BR>
sharp line. If we draw a line, we will have to say that there are two kinds 
<BR>
of people in the world--Extropians and non-Extropians. I'm right with Brian 
<BR>
in agreeing that there will be clear cases of people who are Extropians 
<BR>
(even if they have never heard of the philosophy). These will be those who 
<BR>
assent to (or would assent to) the Extropian Principles. Some people will 
<BR>
clearly be non-Extropians--those who reject the Principles. Yet I don't 
<BR>
think it follows that we should say that someone is or is not Extropian (or 
<BR>
extropian) in most cases.
<BR>
<P>Lee Daniel Crocker suggested that one point that might be made is that &quot;the 
<BR>
use of words to identify things should be less rigorous than set theory in 
<BR>
some contexts&quot;. I agree with this. I suggest that we think of &quot;Extropian&quot; 
<BR>
and &quot;extropian&quot; as a fuzzy set. Different people will be more or less 
<BR>
extropian. I would not be especially uncomfortable with someone describing 
<BR>
themselves as Extropian even if they had reservations about one of the 
<BR>
Principles (or had a variant reinterpretation of a principle). I do go 
<BR>
along with Brian in that a full-fledged Extropian is someone who matches 
<BR>
the set the most closely, that is, someone who assents to all the 
<BR>
Principles. Two points about this:
<BR>
<P>(1) We might want to encourage people to call themselves capital &quot;E&quot; 
<BR>
Extropians only if they feel comfortable agreeing with all the Principles. 
<BR>
However, we should not discourage people from describing themselves as 
<BR>
&quot;extropian&quot; (with a small &quot;e&quot;) if they agree with much or most of the 
<BR>
Extropian Principles. It *is* a fuzzy set (Lee Daniel will shoot me for 
<BR>
using &quot;is&quot; and &quot;fuzzy&quot; together...), so this makes sense to me. Natasha's 
<BR>
point about inclusion resonates strongly with me. As does QueenMuse's 
<BR>
reference to Catholic (or any religious) dogma. I do not want to push 
<BR>
people, telling them &quot;you're not extropian&quot; when they may agree with the 
<BR>
Extropian Principles in many ways. I'd rather welcome them and include 
<BR>
them, fostering their extropian attitudes while challenging their remaining 
<BR>
non-extropian attitudes in a respectful but firm way.
<BR>
<P>I don't especially like to take the role of saying &quot;everyone's right here&quot;, 
<BR>
but I suppose I am doing something like that. Brian's concern to protect 
<BR>
the integrity of the memeplex and the meaningfulness of the terms gets my 
<BR>
complete support. At the same time, I don't think doing this requires 
<BR>
drawing a sharp line, and it certainly doesn't require excluding those who 
<BR>
we think are on the far side of the line. (Not that I think Brian was doing 
<BR>
the latter.) I think it would be sensible to reserve &quot;Extropian&quot; for those 
<BR>
who affirm all or practically all of the Principles. But &quot;extropian&quot; as an 
<BR>
adjective can apply to varying degrees. Even in the former case, someone 
<BR>
might reasonably say &quot;I am an Extropian, except that I have reservations 
<BR>
about Principle X)&quot;.
<BR>
<P>(2) This is a slightly different point, but bears re-iterating: The 
<BR>
Extropian Principles are *not* statements of specific beliefs. They are 
<BR>
expressions of basic values and attitudes. I'm not sure that everyone has 
<BR>
grasped this, since I see mention of particular technologies such as 
<BR>
cryonics and nanotechnology in this discussion. Nowhere in the Principles 
<BR>
does it say that being Extropian/extropian requires accepting the 
<BR>
desirability or workability of particular technologies. Quite the contrary. 
<BR>
I deliberately designed the document so as to be maximally open to 
<BR>
differing means of reaching shared goals and implementing shared values. 
<BR>
The Principles are about as non-limiting as they can be while preserving 
<BR>
the integrity of their content.
<BR>
<P>I do think we should be very careful in labeling specific activities as 
<BR>
Extropian or non-Extropian (with or without the capital &quot;e&quot;). Whether some 
<BR>
activity contributes to living extropically depends very much on 
<BR>
context--on the individual person, their abilities, their aptitudes, their 
<BR>
propensities, and their circumstances. Someone once said that dancing was 
<BR>
not very extropian. I found that quite narrow-minded. Dancing, gardening, 
<BR>
listening to music, taking a nap, all can be perfectly appropriate in 
<BR>
context. We cannot be constantly out producing and creating. Brian 
<BR>
definitely reflects my own views in stressing that Extropian thinking 
<BR>
emphasizes challenge over comfort, but that should not be taken to mean 
<BR>
that you can never relax, smell the roses, and have fun. All of these 
<BR>
things are vital to enjoying our lives and to flourishing and to expanding 
<BR>
our selves. Yes, you can get too much of these things. Again, it's a matter 
<BR>
of context and balance.
<BR>
<P>So I'm with Brian in that we should be able to constructively challenge 
<BR>
each other regarding whether we are living extropically, and should be 
<BR>
helpful in suggesting ways of living more extropically (e.g. how to eat for 
<BR>
longevity, how to exercise healthily, how to develop &quot;emotional 
<BR>
intelligence&quot;, how to improve our cognitive skills, how to develop our 
<BR>
social skills, how to relax most effectively in order to refuel, and how to 
<BR>
take pleasure in every day as much as possible). Let's just steer clear of 
<BR>
the approach that religion has mastered--that of excluding and of 
<BR>
criticizing without understanding of context.
<BR>
<P>Onward!
