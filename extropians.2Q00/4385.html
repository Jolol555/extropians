Damien Broderick responded to Jeff Davis:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I do have a hunch that even more advanced science isn't going to show us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the Earth is actually a gigantic tetrahedron. Will it teach us rules
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of game theory and economics that *altogether* escape the strictures known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to us? Maybe, in which case you're probably right. But if so, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;post-Spike ET cultures are likely to be beyond our cognitive event horizon,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aren't they? So even if they're *there*, you can't get there from here -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*except* via a Spike of your own... Does this disable the Great Filter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;model? Dunno. Over to Robin... :)

<BR>
<EM>&gt;Unless the third law of thermodynamics is a kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;phlogiston theory believed in by primitive civilisations, even the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;post-spike entities will do stuff to entropy. And this is likely to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;noticeable, assuming they do big entropy-modifying things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Which hinges on the assumption that they would do that, which might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of course be a culturally influenced assumption we make since we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;currently live in a &quot;more is better&quot; culture. The environmentally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conscious posthumans of Egan's _Diaspora_ might have a different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;view).
</EM><BR>
<P>They conclusion that much more advanced creatures would be visible
<BR>
to us is based on the idea that
<BR>
A) they would be subject to physical resource constraints that we
<BR>
perceive (e.g., visible mass and entropy), and that
<BR>
B) their preferences would be such as to make such constraints
<BR>
frequently binding.
<BR>
<P>It seems that people trained primarily in the physical sciences
<BR>
appreciate how strong the arguments are for the first of these
<BR>
conditions, but do not appreciate that the social sciences offer
<BR>
similarly strong arguments for the second condition.
<BR>
<P>One the one hand you could imagine that advanced creatures will
<BR>
find sources of mass and negentropy that are so bountiful as to
<BR>
make such creatures completely uninterested in making use of
<BR>
the mass and negentropy we see in the universe.  Possible in
<BR>
theory, but not very likely, it seems to people with
<BR>
physical science expertize.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand you could imagine that advanced creatures would
<BR>
have preferences so different from those of the Earth creatures
<BR>
we know that they would just have no interest in using the resources
<BR>
we see in the universe, even though such resources would be of
<BR>
great use to creatures who had preferences like us.  To someone
<BR>
with expertize in social science and evolution, this also does
<BR>
not seem very likely.
<BR>
<P>Now I know that many people with physical science expertize are
<BR>
of the opinion that there is no such thing as social science
<BR>
expertize.  But such people are just wrong.
