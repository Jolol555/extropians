<EM>&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:retroman@turbont.net?Subject=Re:%20smart%20pistols&In-Reply-To=&lt;3910BDAA.34EA98B3@turbont.net&gt;">retroman@turbont.net</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Most toddlers (under the age of 4) would have a hard time opening a desk &gt;drawer, lifting the gun and pulling its trigger, so within this age group, &gt;drowning deaths are greater than gunshot deaths.  Most unintentional self- or &gt;other-child-inflicted gunshot deaths of minors (unintentional including &gt;bang-bang games where the child does not understand the reality of the result) &gt;occur in ages 6 - 12, during a dip in child drownings, and in this age group, &gt;when drowning in five-gallon buckets is much less of a danger, gunshot deaths &gt;are most likely greater.  For ages 15-24, when drowning deaths once again spike, &gt;intentional firearm homicides and suicides are also higher than for those &gt;younger or older.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;My 3 year old nephew is quite capable of all sorts of mischief and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;quite strong,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What about a 2 year old?  A one year old?  Where is the cutoff point from the general conclusions you draw from your particular, private and personal anecdotal evidence?
</EM><BR>
<P>it all depends upon the child, the weapon, and the trigger pull. And no,
<BR>
I don't advocate leaving guns lying around for little kids to get their
<BR>
hands on, but I don't advocate locking them all up either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;so no, I contest your dismissal of toddlers, now that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;has been proven that your hysteria with regards to them is not supported
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;by the statistics. Anyone on this list with kids that age can probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;contest your claims on that score.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone with kids capable or incapable of same under the age of 4 please indicate the age of their kid and whether (s)he is capable or incapable of opening a desk drawer, removing a pistol from it, and pulling it's trigger.  Let's establish a consensus cutoff age.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of what? To handle firearms or use 5 gallon buckets? I advocate a law
<BR>
mandating child safety locks on all 5 gallon buckets...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The rise in 6-12, 12-15, and 15 and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;up shootings can be directly correlated to the decrease in the number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;children who are taught responsible gun safety from an early age. I shot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;my first 22 at age 7, and safety, responsibility and the consequences of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;shooting were taught to myself and every other child in my family.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is your belief basd upon your personal experience and your personal &gt; interpretation of that experience, but Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson would
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; maintain that it is because the supreme court removed christian
</EM><BR>
indoctrination
<BR>
<EM> &gt; from our schools, and many other &quot;reasons&quot; can be given.  What makes
</EM><BR>
YOUR 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; particular reason objective rather than subjective (and the expected 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subjective, given your personal baseline on gun-related issues)?
</EM><BR>
<P>The fact that the government's own evidence supports my contention.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the governments own studies support the contention that children who are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;raised thus are far less likely to either cause accidental shootings or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;commit intentional shootings, and the once plentiful and popular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;shooting programs at public schools are now mostly non-existent, I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;its quite obvious that we need firearms safety back in schools as much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as we need sex safety, drug safety, and driver safety.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The kind of firearm safety course we need in school is NOT an NRA type &gt;how-to-shoot and political indoctrination aimed at creating new NRA members, but &gt;rather the instruction for children not to touch any gun they find, but to warn &gt;any other children who might have seen it to keep their distance, and to report &gt;it to a responsible adult, bringing the other children with him/her, if &gt;possible. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You are obviously totally ignorant of the Eddie Eagle program the NRA
<BR>
provides free to all schools that request it. What you describe as
<BR>
proper instruction is EXACTLY what the Eddie Eagle program teaches. I
<BR>
suggest you educate yourself as to what you are talking about before you
<BR>
go spouting off again. It only makes you look more foolish, because
<BR>
there are plenty of people on this list who know, just like I do, what
<BR>
the Eddie Eagle program is all about.
<BR>
<P>&lt;      Parents should have the choice to train and supervise their own
<BR>
<EM>&gt;childrens' introduction to firearms, or to refrain from doing so; would you, as &gt;a civil liberetarian, authorize your hated big gobvernment to usurp that &gt;parental right?  AIDS, drugs and automobiles kill when people use them wrong, &gt;but firearms kill if they are used right (and this does not refer to ethically &gt;or responsibly, but in the sense of technically correct).
</EM><BR>
<P>Considering you think that the 2nd Amendment requires that the militia
<BR>
(i.e. the entire voting population, according to Blacks Legal Dictionary
<BR>
of the period) must be 'well regulated' (i.e. trained and skilled in the
<BR>
use of arms, according to that same publication, and supported in US v.
<BR>
Emerson &amp; US v. Miller), then it is obviously the legal duty of every
<BR>
person who wishes to become a voter at the age of majority (i.e. 18) to
<BR>
be well trained and skilled in the use of firearms. Thus firearms
<BR>
training should be a curriculum requirement of every civics course in
<BR>
high school. At least there is a constitutional basis for that, while
<BR>
driver ed, sex ed, and drug ed do not.
