</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;The ruling by Judge Jackson is obscene but not unexpected. Microsoft has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been losing this case almost from day one. (Why the markets reacted so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sharply to an all but forgone outcome requires  an explanation.)  Their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defense at trial was weak and unconvincing; yet given the nature of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; antitrust law, no rational defense was really possible.

<P>I've got nothing against Microsoft, and I like my Windows98, even though
<BR>
I sometimes wonder why I paid extra to get it when it works much the
<BR>
same as Win95. I mean OK, so the navigation toolbar can be used a bit
<BR>
more like 'net browser navigation, no big deal, folder hierarchy is just
<BR>
the same, etc.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately for MS, they seem to have been quite unable to be
<BR>
straightforward or forthright about their reasons for managing at least
<BR>
one key issue the way that they have. Specifically, as an actual user of
<BR>
Win98, I can confidently report that it was totally unnecessary for them
<BR>
to insist that a Microsoft web browser be packaged with every copy of
<BR>
Windows98 -- in other words, there was no *technical* necessity for then
<BR>
to market things that way. For anyone who's used a browser running under
<BR>
Windows, it's readily apparent that the browser is a separate program.
<BR>
However, Microsoft chose to market Windows &quot;only with browser&quot; -- and if
<BR>
there's an easy, problem free way for the user to uninstall their
<BR>
browser, they sure haven't been advertising that.
<BR>
<P>Maybe this is picky, but I would feel better about MS if they had said
<BR>
all along that including the browser was strictly a case of marketing or
<BR>
packaging, it being their commercial right not to offer anything less
<BR>
than a package deal if they don't want to? Also, the voluntary uninstall
<BR>
option ought to be right there somewhere in the Internet Explorer Start
<BR>
Menu folder, with every assurance that Win98 will work right without
<BR>
this &quot;extra&quot; in place, if that's what an individual user wants to do. As
<BR>
far as saying that Windows won't run without MS Internet Explorer, well,
<BR>
if MS does things in a way that unnecessarily restricts its customers,
<BR>
that counts for more than all the complaints of a thousand competing
<BR>
companies, it seems to me.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I should try for some analogy here, I mean sheesh, next thing you
<BR>
know, Ford Motor Co (say) might insist that their cars won't run without
<BR>
the &quot;integrated hubcaps&quot; or something; at some point the presumption of
<BR>
customers' intelligence and freedom to choose ought to be placed
<BR>
foremost, don't you think?
