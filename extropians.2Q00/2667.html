<P>This is Cutler's dysdifferentiation theory (which seems to have been 
<BR>
developed
<BR>
circa 1985).  It sounds like Koestler is recycling it (do you have a ref. 
<BR>
for
<BR>
that?)

Actually, Koestler came up with a rather detailed and coherent theory on 
<BR>
this, as best I recall, either in the '60's or '70's - almost certainly not 
<BR>
later.  I read his &quot;The Act of Creation,&quot; from the '60's, and &quot;Janus,&quot; - 
<BR>
'70's? - and &quot;The Ghost in The Machine&quot; - '70's - as well as some of his 
<BR>
earlier socio/psychological/political/philosophical work, such as &quot;Darkness 
<BR>
at Noon,&quot; but it was a long time ago...
<BR>
<P>I think that one problem that Koestler may have had was/is shared by 
<BR>
Buckminster Fuller, Garret Hardin, Tim Leary, Robert Pirsig, and, of course, 
<BR>
Ayn Rand.  He exposed sacred cows, and he had coherent, well-thought-out 
<BR>
answers.  He was a system builder who never assumed that some discipline was 
<BR>
outside his ken and must be deferred to the &quot;experts.&quot;  He was able to draw 
<BR>
information simultaneously from multiple disciplines and find the common 
<BR>
threads.
