<EM>&gt; I am urgently in need of some advice from someone who has experience in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recovering damaged magentic digital data storage media.  In particular, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need to know about the practical capabilities of reading data from 9-track
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and 8 mm tape that has been submerged for as much as 24 hours in dirty water.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  While I appreciate the informed opinions of the many tech-savvy folks on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list to the effect of &quot;it should be no problem&quot;, I REALLy need to talk to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone who actually does this kind of work or who can get me in touch with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone who has done it.  Any practical leads would be greatly appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<P>We deal with 9 track, 8mm and 4 mmm tape all the time at work. I'll ask
<BR>
the operations guys what the SOP is with such a situation. First thing
<BR>
is don't heat it up to dry it more than 10-20 degrees above ambient. We
<BR>
can try to recover the data for you if you want, put it on newer media.
