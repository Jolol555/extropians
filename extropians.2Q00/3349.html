&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure of work has kept me away from the list for the past 
<BR>
couple of months so that it was only tonight, reviewing the archive, 
<BR>
that I learned of Sasha's death.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said, better 
<BR>
than I could have said it, by others.  But I want to proclaim myself, 
<BR>
as Robert Bradbury put it, one of Sasha's children.  It was his 
<BR>
magnificent web site that brought me to transhumanism as well as  to 
<BR>
a fountain of other amazing and exciting ideas that I've only begun 
<BR>
to explore.  I never met him or even corresponded with him beyond 
<BR>
leaving a message in his guest book.  I hope he read it.  I'm a 
<BR>
different person today than I was a year ago because of him.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My deepest condolences to his family.
