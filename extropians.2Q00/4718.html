<EM>&gt; &gt;I think so, though I am not 100% positive.  As I said, this is something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I've noticed; my aggregate sample size may not be large enough to mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anything, although my samples do cover a broad range of ethnic groups.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;do know of other people who have noticed the same thing though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well I know I can smell the differences of the members of my family.  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Ahhh...this is exactly what I am talking about.  So are you saying you
<BR>
could identify the members of your family strictly by smell?  In practice,
<BR>
I can only really identify by smell people I am intimately familiar with.
<BR>
I don't think that we are constructed to use this as a primary means of
<BR>
identification, but most animals seem to have this capability to one
<BR>
extent or another.  My observations about people with similar ethnicity
<BR>
take into account variations or similarities in diet, lifestyles, etc
<BR>
(or at least I am pretty sure they do).  
<BR>
<P>Note that I am not talking about artificially added smells either, but you
<BR>
probably already understood that.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Although I've never done any conscious comparisons -- and I believe I have a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less acute sense of smell than most.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I've always suspected that my sense of smell was relatively weak. 
<BR>
(Actually, a test by NASA many years ago confirmed this.)
