<P><EM>&gt; I'll forward a posting on a proposal for a maximally automated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; village. The question is, How far could we go with automating all standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintenance and chores like vacuuming, scrubbing, lawn mowing etc? I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sure we can go very far if we are flexible with the initial design. Then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; let's see how well the &quot;genetic agorithms&quot; do with improving the design
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course, by designing everything to fit the machines it can be made
<BR>
trivial (actually not even then, but anyway) to run an automated
<BR>
village. However, it might not be entirely pleasant to live in such a
<BR>
place since it will not be designed for human chaos. 
<BR>
<P>The problems one should think of carefully before setting up something
<BR>
like this is: what are you trying to achieve? Is this solution brittle
<BR>
and overplanned? Here in Sweden we have many buildings from the 30's
<BR>
created by progressive functionalists that had a lot of apparently
<BR>
great ideas about the house as a machine for living in. Unfortunately
<BR>
they ignored social realities, and all the helpful automation and
<BR>
systems they had added went unused.
<BR>
<P>Genetic algorithms would likely turn the village into a nicely
<BR>
dangerous and chaotic place. After all, you can never be entirely sure
<BR>
the robots will be doing the right thing, and occasionally (likely
<BR>
quite often) unanticipated quirks will appear. When other robots
<BR>
encounter these quirks their quirks will also be activated, and the
<BR>
resulting co-ecolution might lead to something very much different
<BR>
from the efficient all-automated village originally enticipated:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Why is that half of the garden so unkempt? Well, our first lawnmower
<BR>
apparently had a mutation that made it avoid it. Then our neighbour's
<BR>
mower instead began to mowe it, and everything was fine for a
<BR>
while. Unfortunately it was rather &quot;aggressive&quot;, running into any
<BR>
mower that came close, but it did a great job. After a few months our
<BR>
mowers learned never to go there. But then the neighbour's mower had
<BR>
an upgrade and only tended its part of the garden, and our mowers have
<BR>
long since bred out any genes that make them mowe that part. So we
<BR>
tried introducing some new ones, but they mowed my rosebushes, earning
<BR>
a lot of negative fitness, and the other mowers prevented them from
<BR>
going into the unmowed area since they had learned that overall
<BR>
fitness decreased when one of them got there and was ejected. So after
<BR>
a while we were left again with mowers that refused to mowe that
<BR>
half. Now we are planning to buy some lawnmower herder robots - we
<BR>
hope they can fix it.&quot;
