<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; I have spent this weekend attempting to evolve causality in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; cellular automaton (I wanted to find a 2D automaton rule that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; generated patterns corresponding to the space-time diagrams of a 1D
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; automaton), and it was definitely tricky. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Interesting stuff. A rule like: 'fire if my right-hand neighbor is firing'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; would generate leftwards trajectories. You could elaborate on that to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; traces to bounce off each other is you added a second class of firing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; mode. Are you looking for something deeper than that - what's the target
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; you're trying to fit? Are you just doing thresholding on local neighbors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; or are you using a more sophisticated class of 1D automation?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The origin of the experiment is a cosmological idea I have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;playing around with: the entire 4-D history of the universe is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stable state of a 4-D cellular automaton. If this hypothetical CA is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;started with a random state, then it will converge to an allowable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;history of the universe.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would the stability matter? Couldn't each time step of the 4-D
<BR>
automata be a universe, or do you see some reason to require that
<BR>
the world be persistent over a 5th dimension?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My experiment was far simpler, I used a 2D automaton with binary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;states and the Moore neighborhood and a 2^9 bit rule denoting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;result of every possible local state (this was the genes I ran the GA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on). After running the automaton for a few steps, I calculated fitness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the final state. At first I tried to make the fitness function
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;depend on how well the pattern fitted a predetermined 1-D rule, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right now I'm just contenting myself trying to get a causal evolution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(i.e. a one-to-one mapping of states in the previous row to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;next). So far I have not yet succeeded.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure that - in general - GAs are appropriate for finding CAs
<BR>
with particular stable states, though it's not something I've ever
<BR>
tried. Intuitively it seems the mutating a transition rule either
<BR>
won't make a difference to a particular stable configuration or it'll
<BR>
change it completely. What you really want is small incremental
<BR>
changes you can hill-climb over. Do you get that under the description
<BR>
system you describe above?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As I see it, the interesting question is if you can get the 2D
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;automaton to evolve a consistent state from a random state. It would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also incorporate the possibility of &quot;synchronicity&quot; and nonlocal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interactions, as two separated patterns in the 1D world could have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been affected by precursor states at early steps in the 2D world.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure what you mean by consistent state. If initial conditions
<BR>
are irrelevant then every terminal state is determined by the
<BR>
transition rules, which puts an upper bound on what you can represent
<BR>
of 2^9 terminal 'images.' Vastly fewer in practice - but I'm sure you
<BR>
could map any stable state you want onto cellular rules given a
<BR>
sufficiently powerful computational cell model.
<BR>
<P>The idea that non-locality is explainable in terms of CA is appealing,
<BR>
but how does it differ from assuming some other kind of hidden state?
