Lee Daniel Crocker fired back:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't see this as &quot;getting it right&quot; at all.  In the short run, this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is one regulating agency patching a problem created by another, made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary because of the artificial monopoly they both created.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the long run it will make access /more/ expensive, not less, than if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both agencies got out of the way and let the market work.  In a free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market, prices are lowest when they are structured most closely to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality of the costs of producing the product.  Network access time is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a scarce commodity measured by time; two minutes of access time really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is twice as valuable as one minute.  If consumers are forced by law to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buy it by the month and average their use, some group of consumers will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realize that they can overgraze the commons by hogging their full month
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and subletting time to others; and they don't have the infrastructure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the original providers do for maintaining the equipment, supporting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; users, etc., so they will contract for those services from the original
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provider at the expense of the its non-hogging customers, further
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasing costs, etc., etc.  It's cheaper just to cut out the middle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and let the big boys sell minutes in the first place.
</EM><BR>
<P>You were mislead by the headline.  The &quot;ban&quot; in question isn't a ban
<BR>
on private citizens or their right to charge whatever they want for
<BR>
Internet service.  It's a ban on the FCC charging extra taxes at a
<BR>
per-minute rate.
<BR>
<P>Congress is voting to get out of the way.
