One word: deterrence.
<BR>
<P>Here in the UK, we're a _lot_ further down the cameras-everywhere route
<BR>
than you guys are in the USA.
<BR>
<P>About the one unambiguously popular use of cameras in public is at red
<BR>
lights at traffic intersections. The cameras currently used use film
<BR>
(expensive) and doppler radar (ditto); basically they're synched to the
<BR>
lights, and if a metal object goes through the lights while they're red
<BR>
it gets photographed and a police officer then goes through the film
<BR>
reel and works out what to do.
<BR>
<P>Because these camera/radar units are expensive, they tend to get
<BR>
positioned only at accident black spots -- where people are/have been
<BR>
killed by idiots running lights, or where a fast stretch of road is
<BR>
suddenly terminated by traffic lights. Usually there's a camera box there,
<BR>
but more often than not it's empty; typically there'll be about one live
<BR>
camera for every five to ten enclosures.
<BR>
<P>The headache is that they also use the same camera equipment to stop
<BR>
speeding; typically tuned to about 10% above the speed limit (so that
<BR>
any hits are unambiguous). The cameras are often deployed on wide,
<BR>
straight roads in urban areas where there's a low speed limit (for
<BR>
example, because there are schools/residencies nearby), but they also
<BR>
crop up on motorways and other main roads where they're cheaper to deploy
<BR>
than police officers in a pursuit car. The speed cameras are markedly less
<BR>
popular/tolerated than the red-light cams ...
<BR>
<P>And the real headache comes when you consider the new generation cameras
<BR>
that are being built. If there's one thing the UK leads the world in
<BR>
right now, it's intrusive spying camera technology. The government is
<BR>
shelling out lots of money for video cameras with built-in DSPs that
<BR>
can do enough rudimentary image analysis to OCR a car number plate at
<BR>
fifty to a hundred metres. The ostensible reason is that this will negate
<BR>
the need for costly rolls of film and make the system more efficient; but
<BR>
some of us are rather worried about the idea of these cameras being set to
<BR>
trigger when any vehicle goes past at any speed, and log the number plate
<BR>
and time -- can you spell &quot;total mobility surveillance&quot;?
<BR>
<P>Yours from the land of five million cameras,
<BR>
