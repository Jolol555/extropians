When I visit cities with subways I like to get on and pick stops at random,
<BR>
go up &amp; walk around.  I love not having any idea what sort of neighborhood
<BR>
I'll find myself in (there are those who would say this is dangerous, but
<BR>
the only times I've ever been attacked by another human have been times when
<BR>
I was in &quot;good&quot; neighborhoods--maybe because I let my guard down in the good
<BR>
neighborhoods).
<BR>
<P>I can imagine that waking up in a future time might be a bit like that, only
<BR>
on a grand scale.  All the sf books I've ever read on the subject portray a
<BR>
future that has different trappings from the present, but the people are
<BR>
quite like the ones in the present.  I would expect people to be very
<BR>
different from the way they are now, given the accelerating rate of cutural
<BR>
change.  It's interesting to imagine what it would feel like to be utterly
<BR>
ignorant.
<BR>
<P>When I was younger, I used to like to go to a foreign country whose language
<BR>
I didn't know, taking with me only a couple of changes of clothes and enough
<BR>
money to buy food &amp; lodging.  I found that it was a good way to find, sort
<BR>
of, the essence of myself, apart from all my possessions and friends and my
<BR>
&quot;place&quot; in the society of which I was a part.  But I was always glad to
<BR>
return home.  The thought of being in a foreign time from which I couldn't
<BR>
return is a bit daunting.

<EM>&gt; I kind of worry sometimes about how culture may change when/if I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reanimated. Given enough time who knows what things could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like. What if,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for example, freedom of speech is completely eliminated. It would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to live in such a world then not to live at all, but it causes me some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anxiety.
