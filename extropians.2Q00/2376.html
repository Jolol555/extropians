<BR>
<EM> &gt; Assertion 1: I disagree.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Assumption 1: Presently, we are all carbon-based 'persons', that take up
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; space.  
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
That was clearly not my assumption. I was talking about strictly
<BR>
deterministic (pseudorandom, not random) systems in the same state
<BR>
with stricly identical inputs. Nondeterministically noisy nonlinear
<BR>
dynamics-systems (strongly divergent state space Hamiltonian) are
<BR>
absolutely not covered by that.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Assertion 2:  It is therefore relevant to consider copies of both
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; matter-based 'persons' and software-based 'persons'.
</EM><BR>
<P>Copies of matter-based persons are clearly not clones but individua,
<BR>
and hence irrelevant in discussion context. Only computational models
<BR>
are covered in that particular case. Since the situation is highly
<BR>
construed/pathological (synched computational models with identical
<BR>
inputs) is is quite irrelevant to reality (unless somebody wants to
<BR>
demo something, that is).
<BR>
<P>I did not realize that needed to be said, but apparently it wasn't as
<BR>
obvious as I thought.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Assertion 3: I don't believe the matter can be addressed satisfactorily
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; without introducing definitions of 'self' or 'person'.  
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Definitions: (IMO), 'selves' and 'people' are processes.  They are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; carbon-based (so far) functions.  These functions are in a constant state of
</EM><BR>
<P>Rather, on naturally evolved nanotechnology (self-rep cabable systems
<BR>
based on linear solvated biopolymers and self-assembled biomolecular
<BR>
assemblies).
<BR>
<P>A process is usually a narrowly designed CS term. Physical processes
<BR>
are a superset of that (i.e. a finite machine falling along a sequence 
<BR>
of states is a CS process. A computer running the above is a physical
<BR>
system engaged in a process of pushing electrons around, dissipating
<BR>
heat, producing a few photons, transporting cooling fluid and
<BR>
generating noise).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; change, on both 'hardware' and 'software' levels.  As processes, 'people'
</EM><BR>
<P>The distinction between hardware and software is not meaningful when
<BR>
talking about a biological organism.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; are not only defined by their 'present state' (arrangement of matter, mode
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of thought), but also by their 'present external conditions', since a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; significant aspect of their function is to react to their environment.  I
</EM><BR>
<P>Why don't we just describe the organism as a physical system with a
<BR>
state, and its interaction with environment as I/O? 
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; consider these 'conditions' to be: the variables (whether they be local or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; remote, accessible to that 'self's' awareness or not) that affect the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 'person', at that instant in time.  Of possible interest is the implication
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that a 'previous self' (the 'person' you were a moment before) both was the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 'process' and is a 'present external condition'.  Why 'external'?  Because
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that instant in time is 'external' to the present instant in time.  All
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 'previous selves' are thus, in that sense, external to the 'present self'.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe I'm just dense, but you're kinda difficult to understand.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Justification for Assertion 1: Since a 'copy' of a carbon-based 'person',
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; even if physically perfect, cannot occupy the same space as the 'original';
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; from the exact moment of bifurcation, the 'copy' and the 'original' are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; subject to differing 'external conditions'.  As reactions to the 'external
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; conditions' (whether by strict determinism, or by a loose framework of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; patterns based on random events), since the 'conditions' inevitably differ
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; thereafter, the 'functions' will diverge in similarity from that time
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; forward.  Even if both the original and the copy occupy the same room, for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; example, since they cannot occupy the same space, they will each see a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; different perspective of 'the room' around them.  Since the input is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; different for each, 'the room' will be processed differently for each,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; potentially invoking different thoughts and different (re)actions. Since
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; these (different) thoughts and actions change and further define each
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 'person', and since each 'person' is also a function of it's 'previous
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; self', it is safe to assume that they will grow increasingly different as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; time extends away from the moment of bifurcation.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Yes, all very true (in fact internal noise and chaotical dynamics will
<BR>
make you diverge very soon anyway), but this is not the point of
<BR>
original discussion. You can't clone macroscopical physical systems in
<BR>
exactly the same quantum state, and even if you could, you would not
<BR>
be able to provide them exactly the same input, even ignoring QM
<BR>
randomness.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Assertion 3: Things that become different are not the same.  ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>Duh. Sure.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Questions: While considering the result of copying a 'self' that is not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; based in organic matter (a software-based person), I observe that you make
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the following assumption; the process of copying places both resulting
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 'copies' in exactly similar 'external conditions'.  Is this necessarily the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; case?  Is this even possible?  Can two virtual persons occupy the same
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 'virtual space' at the same time?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, we're talking about a computational system. We set them to be
<BR>
both in the same state at the beginning of the simulation. The virtual 
<BR>
space thing is strictly irrelevant, as is the physical location of the 
<BR>
hardware boxes (unless you have to make relativistic measurements as
<BR>
to the state of synch of both systems) have no impact upon that. Same
<BR>
state, same input, keep clock ticks/iterations synched, that's it.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Justification for Assertion 1 (virtual context): The suggestion that it is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; knowable whether the 'original' was even copied in the first place (i.e. I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; copied that 'person', there are two now, and that redundancy is going to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; save my ass) implies that there is some context in which the two are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; differentiable.  I assert that that contextual difference, whatever it may
</EM><BR>
<P>Err, what? Of course it is knowable, I have to have access to the full
<BR>
state of an object during copy, and this implies that during the copy
<BR>
the object state is frozen/suspended, i.e. the simulation clock is not
<BR>
ticking. I also need communication channel between these boxes open,
<BR>
and have to make corrections for synching latency between two physical
<BR>
systems in areas of differing spacetime curvature. The latter point is
<BR>
quite irrelevant in practice, when we're talking about two
<BR>
current-generation computers in physical proximity to each other.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; be, represents a difference in 'conditions', and will therefore potentially
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; generate differences among the 'persons'.  If the virtual 'copy' is in NO
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; way differentiable from the 'original', such as if, as you write, they
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; occupy exactly &quot;overlapping state space trajectories&quot;, then under what
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; conditions could you possibly kill one and not all of them?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
You can kill all of them but one without actually destroying
<BR>
information, provided you ignore the potential future bifurcation
<BR>
argument. Keeping the clones in the same state is an effort,
<BR>
particularly if on noisy, fast hardware in remote locations. If the
<BR>
physical layer is close enough, it wants to make them bifurcate/start
<BR>
diverging. 
<BR>
<P>If we're a perfectly synched clone, I'd object to other instances of
<BR>
me being terminated without my consent, since this would rob them from
<BR>
an opportunity to diverge. In fact, I would probably tell the
<BR>
experimenter (the callous asshole) that I want other copies of me to
<BR>
become individuals, and voice my indignation about being subjected to
<BR>
such an experiment without my consent.
