<P><P>&quot;Cop killer&quot; bullets are essentially a media-generated urban legend. 
<BR>
Modern body armor will stop all modern pistol bullets, &quot;cop killer&quot; or
<BR>
otherwise, with the exception of some highly specialized cartridges for use
<BR>
in highly specialized guns that have never been available for public 
<BR>
consumption anyway.  There is also the matter of the fact that any rifle
<BR>
bullet will penetrate the soft body armor worn by cops; there is nothing
<BR>
special about this ability.
<BR>
<P>Hollywood has pretty much invented the whole mystically
<BR>
endowed genre of &quot;cop killer&quot; ammunition, usually described as
<BR>
&quot;teflon-coated&quot;, &quot;black-tipped&quot;, or using a description of some other
<BR>
irrelevant feature of the cartridge.  The ignorant public eats this stuff
<BR>
up.
