<P><EM>&gt; Earlier in this post I mentioned experiences I've had which lead me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  believe that our minds are only fragments of a greater intelligence.  One 
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  these experiences involves a sort of super-data-base which can be accessed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  from altered states of consciousness such as a trance state. I haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  studied enough psychology to know if this is the sort of thing Jung 
</EM><BR>
referred
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  to as the &quot;collective unconscious&quot; but I've heard the term, and it seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  fit the experience.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a theory which I constructed myself at an early age without ever 
<BR>
having read the works of Jung or any other material on the subject. I have 
<BR>
often pondered on the possibility that all Humans and/or Animals comunicate 
<BR>
via unseen as yet unmeasurable methods. My original basis for this theory was 
<BR>
my own personal experience where I have invented various items only to find 
<BR>
that others have invented the same thing completely independently. This has 
<BR>
always been the case throughout history, the TV being a prime example. of 
<BR>
course this original rationalisation for my theory can be discredited by 
<BR>
saying the inventions were the natural progression of current technology and 
<BR>
I would wholly agree.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also added more credance to my theory by adding the evidence of 
<BR>
unexplained ESP cases that had been documented. For example, the conection 
<BR>
between twins feeling each others pain or the sudden and unexplained 
<BR>
realisation of the death of a loved on without any possible knowledge of the 
<BR>
event.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not always believed that there was a scientific explanation for 
<BR>
this link rather I believed in some sort of mubo jumbo majic link. This was 
<BR>
soon dispelled as I learned more  about science and the *real* world and my 
<BR>
view point changed to my current belief. I know think that a link does exist 
<BR>
in some limited form, where information, emotions maybe even cognitive 
<BR>
thoughts can be somehow transmitted from one person to another. I have no 
<BR>
real idea how but modulation of the earths magnetic field by the brains 
<BR>
activity sounds like a feasable starting point. We after all are surrounded 
<BR>
by a thick soup of energy which our senses are consciously oblivious to, it's 
<BR>
not too hard to imagine that we somehow affect this soup and in doing so 
<BR>
impart something to it that can be recieved by the next person.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine this imparted energy modulation or *transmission* 
<BR>
propergating like ripples accross the world. One question that has stuck in 
<BR>
my mind is If this collective unconscious does exist, why are there no 
<BR>
animals that have perfected this comunication. After all surely such an 
<BR>
animal would have little problem surviving, finding food would be easy, just 
<BR>
read the mind of a fellow animal of your species that has found food and go 
<BR>
to where they are. You would know where the preditors were etc etc. Perhaps 
<BR>
this ability is only a recent evolutionary event and only becoming minutely 
<BR>
apparent in the most complex brains on the planet. Maybe it has contributed 
<BR>
to the success of mankind ?.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course as you can see my belief in this link is based on very little 
<BR>
evidence and can easily be argued, but I still think there is something in it 
<BR>
and to be honest the more I learn and think about it , the more I tend to 
<BR>
re-enforce my belief.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex.
