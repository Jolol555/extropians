<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Every Mother Theresa after the first (at any point, the &quot;marginal&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mother
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Theresa) adds something (even if only a little) to society; a net
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps at some extreme adding extra Mother Theresas becomes a cost.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; does a society made excludively of Mother Theresas do, there being no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; save? However, one might safely assume that 100 is a lower quantity 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that necessary to fall to the break-even point.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; We can say that one Bill Gates, also, is a net benefit, for argument's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sake.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Although you can't be sure; the benefit of Bill Gates is in what he 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; built; the cost in what he has destroyed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Given Mother Theresa openly _professed_ views on human suffering -- 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; its necessity; i.e., the necessity of it in the form of the stifling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;poverty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and rampant disease in Third World countries and not in the sense of, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; needing a little adversity to make us stronger -- I'd think there's a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cost associated with even one Mother Theresa.  If ever there was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;character
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that seems almost out of a Rand novel, it is her.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm not sure I understand this point. Could you expand on it? Type slowly, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have trouble keeping up...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; After the first Bill, however, you end up in a blood bath. If anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; subscribes to the &quot;there can only be one&quot; philosophy of existence, it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Bill. So marginal Bills just add to the general multi-sided chaos &amp;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; destruction; a net cost.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Since Gates has yet to use or advocate murder and mayhem or even to show 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bias toward such, I disagree.  (This is not to put Gates on a pedestal.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm talking economically here; rather than actually physically killing each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other, 100 Bill Gates could be expected to spend a lot of effort trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;economically dominate each other, using (not exclusively) extremely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;destructive competitive practices, in an attempt to gain a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;position.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Another point of view is that most of the value of both Bill Gates and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mother Theresa is as icons; they symbolise particular sets of values to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;great amounts of people. From this point of view, 100 of either is only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;marginally more useful than one; those instances occuring after the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not carrying any extra symbolic value.
</EM><BR>
<P>Having started this particular line of discussion with (on second thought) a 
<BR>
not-so-perfect analogy, I feel obliged to chime in.  When I was comparing 
<BR>
Gates to Theresa I was thinking more of the work done by each, and the 
<BR>
comparative benefit to society of that work.
<BR>
<P>I did not have in mind 100 Microsofts competing with each other or 100 
<BR>
Theresas competing for the attention of the world population as the most 
<BR>
committed do-gooder of them all (I realize this was likely not Theresa's 
<BR>
primary goal -- but you get the point).
<BR>
<P>That being said, I realize that the societal &quot;benefit&quot; of Microsoft's work 
<BR>
is arguable and therefore the analogy could have been better.  But I think 
<BR>
the point I was trying to make is a good one -- if I can just remember what 
<BR>
it was :)
