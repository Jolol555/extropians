Garret Smyth asked me to forward the message below... 
<BR>
<P>(As you know, TransVision 2000 (or 2k, or MM) is the third annual European
<BR>
transhumanist conference -- i.e. it's held in Europe but aimed at people
<BR>
from anywhere. This year it will be held in London, July 15-16, and it is
<BR>
hosted by the World Transhumanist Association (WTA) and the Alcor UK group.
<BR>
The conference site is at <A HREF="http://www.transhumanism.com/tv2k/">http://www.transhumanism.com/tv2k/</A> where
<BR>
registration details etc. can be found.)

<P>As transumanists we all know that one day the (trans-)human race will
<BR>
migrate to off-world habitats, but just when will that day come? NASA seem
<BR>
to be our only hope right now, and lets be honest, they're not a very good
<BR>
hope. David Ashford is convinced that the future is in private industry, and
<BR>
that he can radically reduce the cost of space launches leading to a whole
<BR>
new era of space travel.
<BR>
David Ashford is a director of Bristol Spaceplanes and has agreed to speak
<BR>
at the Transvision  2000 conference in July. Bristol Spaceplanes is a
<BR>
private corporation developing commercially viable spaceflight. It was the
<BR>
first extra-US company to registered for the X prize. David Ashford studied
<BR>
aeronautical engineering and rocketry at Imperial, London and Princeton. He
<BR>
worked on assorted aircraft, including Concorde and several naval missile
<BR>
systems. Notably, in the sixties, he was a member of the Hawker Siddeley
<BR>
spaceplane team. (Yes, the UK actually had a serious spaceplane project back
<BR>
then - mind you, she was also capable of winning the world cup then, too.)
