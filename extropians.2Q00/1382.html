<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The so-called 'radical' transhumanism is no longer radically futurist - it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is just a philosophical wing of big business and the political mainstream.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;This is an interesting accusation. As I see it, the goal of much of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the transhumanist movement has been just to become mainstream. Being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;radical has no intrinsic value if you strive to do something practically.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If we agree that Transhumans are part of human mainstream culture (because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; events have overtaken them rather than because of the efforts of a 'hip,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exclusive little group') then what purpose is there for continuation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumanism or extropians? If you have nothing radical to impart, then how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can you be a futurist?
</EM><BR>
<P>We are philosophically radical, we have ideas about how the new stuff
<BR>
can be combined and the consequences of that combination that are
<BR>
definitely not mainstream by far. When I hear about nanotech in the
<BR>
mainstream debate, people don't think beyond &quot;oh, it can make stuff&quot; -
<BR>
our job is to make them think about the consequences (such as changes
<BR>
in infrastructure, production, economy, the concept of resources,
<BR>
medicine, the relation culture and nature etc). We have interesting
<BR>
philosophical and futurist ideas such as dynamical optimism and the
<BR>
questioning of humanity that have not yet percolated into the
<BR>
mainstream and IMHO are extremely necessary to ensure that the new
<BR>
technology (which is what spreads most easily) gets used in new and
<BR>
constructive directions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You misread me ..... I want the mainstream to move on again, and not get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; caught in some Transhuman limbo or 'local minima.' What comes after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhuman now that transhuman is the mainstream? Post/ neo or X-human .....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the evolution will be psycho-biological as much as technological.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure. But becoming part of the mainstream doesn't mean everything is
<BR>
finished. As I discuss above, we still have a lot to do. It is rather
<BR>
unnecessary to worry about the next radically different version of
<BR>
transhumanism when we are busy developing all the time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The posthuman egroup list has been discussing better alternatives to human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pair-bonding monogamy/ monotony, for example.
</EM><BR>
<P>So what else is new? It has been discussed here and elsewhere from
<BR>
time to time too. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; So the swifter and more positive, radical, option is to declare yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; post- or neohuman at the outset, act as though it were true, and wait for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the changes to happen all by themselves!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh! I'm a jupiter brain. This easter I'm going to act as if I was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ~100 km sphere of diamondoid quantum dot cellular automata, surrounded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by a corona of solar collectors and radiators and with a mental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capacity a few billon times the whole of humanity (it could have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more, but those posthuman screensavers take a *lot* of memory, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they are not running). I can think billions of superhuman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thoughts at once, weaving together strands of ideas without the least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; risk of getting confused. I understand all of human history and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowledge just as easily as a human could understand a simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equation.  Hmm, let's start with terraforming Sweden...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But do you believe the above? It is fairly standard in hypnotherapy to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; positive assertions and declarations so the the &quot;subconscious&quot; can bring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the desired effects without interference from the critical mind. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happen to belive that post/neohuman is attainable (indeed has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attained!) by me, whereas my skull wouldn't hold a brain the size of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jupiter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, it makes a lot of sense to live one's life as if you were
<BR>
already the charismatic intelligent trans/post/ex-human you plan to
<BR>
become. But what I was pointing out is that there is a very real limit
<BR>
to the utility of this when you just try to be radical. Making grand
<BR>
gestures or imagining oneself to be superhuman is *fun*, but it better
<BR>
work well together with real life too.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;Hmm. I would think that the words &quot;magick&quot; and &quot;extropian&quot; would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mutually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;exclusive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Like Newton, I am a practitioner of natural magick (a follower of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Constabulus, as was Descartes). As an experimental 'science' it is perfectly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in order to reject SUPERNATURALISM as I do, yet follow the path of the Adept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in trying to &quot;equilibriate the personality in order to direct the forces of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature.&quot; Magick is about development of the magickal Will and ingenium, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enhancing our capacity for altered states. Transcendance, understanding and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control over our environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Chaos Magick (Pete Carroll) is another natural magick system involving the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspension of disbelief. I see most of the rituals as a form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;role-playing&quot; various deities in order to get an inside guide to their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature or associated powers. Enochian Chess (the enochian system was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developed by Elizabeth 1st astrology, John Dee, also used by Golden Dawn)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be played for brainstorming and psycho-strategic purposes even without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believing in active divination.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds very much like my views on magick. I am strongly sceptic to any
<BR>
supernatural explanations, but there are plenty of fascinating
<BR>
psychology involved. I think chaos magick is perhaps the system that
<BR>
most clearly shows the link between magickal ritual and psychology; it
<BR>
would be a fun project to really untangle the (neuro)psychology of
<BR>
chaos magick.
