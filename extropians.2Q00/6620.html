<EM>&gt; This is one of the main motives for supporting a guaranteed income
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floor, or negative income tax, or some such measure (in so far as one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continues to live in a community with taxing and redistributive powers).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to analyses I've read, this is cheaper than more bureaucratic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interventions, less offensive to the recipient, more likely to lead to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small local efforts. In the short term, anyway, before pre-Singularity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; earthquakes screw *everything* up. (Robin Hanson has indicated that he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disagrees with this, which does give me pause.) 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>While the idea is nice (and doable with an enormous &quot;if&quot;), there are a
<BR>
couple tough problems with it.  First of all, you need to start with an
<BR>
enormous positive cash balance to make the system economically viable; a
<BR>
Ponzi scheme would quickly collapse and the taxation required would
<BR>
destroy the economy.  Accruing a real surplus this large is virtually
<BR>
unheard of for any government of significance -- &quot;easier for a camel to
<BR>
pass through the eye of a needle...&quot;.  Second, there are a couple obvious
<BR>
opportunities for abuse.  For one, how would differences in cost of living
<BR>
be accounted for?  The poverty line in the greater Silicon Valley area
<BR>
would put one in the upper middle class in North Dakota.  There are
<BR>
enormous deltas in costs of living for areas that are geographically
<BR>
proximal, allowing one to live a middle-class existence on any minimum
<BR>
income that is large enough to be really useful.  Second, it would have
<BR>
difficulty accounting for groups of single adults that effectively act as
<BR>
a family group.  This is quite common in Silicon Valley, mostly as a
<BR>
response to the high costs of living, and is how I've always lived in
<BR>
Silicon Valley.  If you have 5-7 adults living in the same house for many
<BR>
years (and I usually have), maximizing the economies of scale, one could
<BR>
lead a very easy existence if guaranteed poverty line income.  Heck,
<BR>
that's how we survived just fine when I was earning well below the poverty
<BR>
line.  A minimum income in that situation would have allowed me and all my
<BR>
friends to live a lifestyle that probably is a good bit better than you
<BR>
envision.
<BR>
<P>These are serious problems, and I don't know that they could be &quot;solved&quot;
<BR>
without setting up a bureaucracy that is as bad or worse as the current
<BR>
ones.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Another statistic that should bother the more-or-less pro-welfare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; crowd:  Over the long-term in the US, as the amount spent per person on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; welfare has increased, the number of eligible recipients also has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; increased. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your implication is that leeches breed leeches, or encourage would-be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leeches. But a confounding factor you've apparently ignored, of course, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the entire economic base has skewed enormously in that period. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Actually, that wasn't my point.  My point was that there is something
<BR>
very bad economically about &quot;taxation-for-welfare&quot; systems.  The government
<BR>
has not figured out a way to support the non-productive without causing
<BR>
adverse economic impacts on the individuals they are taxing.  It is quite
<BR>
possible that the system is dragging more people down through taxation
<BR>
(both direct and indirect -- business taxes are a killer) than it is
<BR>
lifting up through welfare.
<BR>
<P>Overall, the U.S. welfare situation actually looks a lot better than most
<BR>
western countries.  The U.S. welfare rate is currently around
<BR>
2.5% of the population, and it rarely tops 4.5%.  In comparison, I believe
<BR>
virtually all the more aggressively socialist states are into the double
<BR>
digits and have been for a long time, many getting worse.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The glory of late-industrial/postindustrial civilisation is that so much of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the horrendous toil of the world's work has been replaced by machines; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corollary is the devastating loss of work and earned income by those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; displaced and untrainable for the new jobs. If some leeches crawl into that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; category, it's still cheaper to let them scam the system minimally than to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; police and hound them out (or so I gather).
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Looking at the various statistics for the U.S. it would appear that we
<BR>
don't have more than maybe 1% of the population that I would classify
<BR>
as real &quot;leeches&quot;.  Most people will work if there is an
<BR>
opportunity and very few blatantly abuse the system.  However, supporting
<BR>
the &quot;leeches&quot; puts a strain on the economy and on the productive class
<BR>
that is disproportionate to their numbers.  In fact, from the best I can
<BR>
tell, the leeches take more from the economy when they are not working,
<BR>
than they are likely to add when they are.  Quite frankly, these people
<BR>
are a social evil and should be tossed to the curb unless some individual
<BR>
values them enough to compensate society by supporting the leech.  On some
<BR>
levels, from the perspective of society, there is no difference between a
<BR>
leech and a garden variety thief.  I think a more selective filter (and
<BR>
lower taxes) would allow charity to do as good a job as government
<BR>
welfare, but cheaper.
