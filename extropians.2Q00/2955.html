<P>from Brent:
<BR>
<EM> &gt;My view is that the better one is preserved, the sooner they
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;will be fully recovered.  There really can be no hard this one made it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and that one didn't.  Tippler, Moravec, and others have theorized
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;about various ways our children will eventually be able to perfectly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;restore all of us.  You say it is to late for Sasha, but I think we
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;can always hold on to hope, even if it's only a slim hope, that some
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;day, some way, our children will be able to recover all of us.  In our
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;current state of ignorance, can we really ever honestly say absolutely
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;never!?  I don't think so.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree. I should have said it *may be* too late for Sasha. This is
<BR>
certainly a greater challenge for future medicine to wake one in such
<BR>
condition.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps my extropian side was slightly suppressed when I wrote my message.
<BR>
Sasha has certainly left us with a lot of information to gather and
<BR>
preserve. I intend to contribute what I have, including photos and emails,
<BR>
to the archive effort. It may be that what I mourn is the part of my brain
<BR>
that enjoyed and recorded my interactions with Sasha. That part of my brain
<BR>
will remain unstimulated by direct contact. How long I mourn will depend on
<BR>
how long it continues to bother me that there is no longer a Sasha with
<BR>
which to communicate. There will no longer be fresh material to inspire.
<BR>
<P>I realize that Sasha's death is another example of selection processes in
<BR>
action. The strong will survive, though the definition of strength may
<BR>
change. He made a choice when he did not sign up for cryonics. It is the
<BR>
same choice that everyone who knows cryonics is an option is free to accept
<BR>
or decline.
<BR>
<P>I've heard these theories that it will someday be possible to revive every
<BR>
individual that every lived, with or without referent information. It's a
<BR>
nice thought, and maybe it's true. I truly did not mean to imply that there
<BR>
is *no* hope. I firmly intend to learn from this experience and provide what
<BR>
support I may.
<BR>
