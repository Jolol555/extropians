<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Maybe you can look at welfare this way:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Givens:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- There is always going to be a segment of the population which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;dead weight&quot;, ie not able to support itself. This seems a fairly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reasonable given to me, but if you don't agree, speak up!
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;- Those unable to support themselves can either be supported by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone else, or must turn to the black economy (and crime). (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;die I guess, but not too many are going for this one out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;choice).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;- Crime costs more than the welfare bill. (is this true?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Your premises are not acceptable.
<BR>
<P>Premise 1) Individuals must support themselves and their progeny by
<BR>
legal means or find someone willing to support them.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Now the libertarian objects to paying tax for welfare. But surely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the agregate level of crime inflicted per person must be at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as invasive of rights as welfare.
</EM><BR>
<P>Individuals or groups of such do not have the right to engage in
<BR>
illegal activities to support themselves. (premise 1)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So the most violating of &quot;good&quot; citizens (hee hee) rights is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crime, followed by paying tax for welfare. Maybe the unsupported
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;citizen should be identified and &quot;terminated&quot; (ouch), but by whom?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How do you seperate such a person (known as &quot;dole bludgers&quot; in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;local rags), from those who are temporarily down on their luck,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but truly trying to &quot;do the right thing&quot; (ooh I'm feeling all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;protestant all of a sudden).
</EM><BR>
<P>You can start by asking them, or you can insist upon an answer if
<BR>
they are caught in an illegal activity. You may help them yourself
<BR>
or refer them to social services.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The point is, you can't make such a decision. Welfare is the least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;detrimental of all available options to each individual's rights,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and thus should be decided upon from an individualist point of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;view.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is consistant with your premise, but your premise is
<BR>
unacceptable (at least to me) and therefore your conclusion is
<BR>
invalid. I've always thought that along with the Bill Of Rights
<BR>
there should have been a Bill Of Duties. One of those would be that
<BR>
you have a duty to be self supporting, and not an unfair burden on
<BR>
your society.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There's been some comment about not letting those who can't afford
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to have babies to do so. Maybe you guys in the US don't have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aging population problem that we do in Australia. Over here,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people say the same things...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    - We don't want No Stinkin Welfare mums (&quot;moms&quot; in American),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    - We don't want No Stinkin immigration,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    - We don't got no Stinkin Workers to support the baby boomers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in retirement
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not saying they can't have them, I'm saying they shouldn't have
<BR>
them. If they do have children, they are responsible for the
<BR>
welfare of these children.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;It's a no brainer. Having kids is not a luxury in the west, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a necessity, from a social viewpoint. That, or increased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;immigration of younguns (those third-world types still know how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its done!). Australia rewards the DINKS (double income no kids)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for their hassle free lifestyle by not requiring them to have any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;responsibility for raising the next generation, apart from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;throwing the same few sheckles to the govt that the parents have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to throw. It's crazy really; we all need the coming generations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but damned if anyone is willing to pay.
</EM><BR>
<P>The people who feel they are necessary and actually have children
<BR>
are the ones who should pay the costs involved.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Oddly enough, many of the same people who don't want to foot this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bill seem to be those who aren't too interested in immigrants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;White people are going to turn up in history books (databases,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yeah yeah) as curiosities; stomped all over the globe, made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everyone else's lives hell, then just when they looked like a real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problem, they just stopped procreating. Couldn't be bothered.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't have any problems with legal immigrants.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Maybe instead of getting cranky with those poor people who breed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all over the place, we could educate their kids. For purely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;selfish reasons.
</EM><BR>
<P>Children are perhaps the single most precious resource of all. But
<BR>
I still think their parents are primarily responsible and should
<BR>
pay the considerable costs involved, and I do not think those who
<BR>
cannot afford them should have them.
