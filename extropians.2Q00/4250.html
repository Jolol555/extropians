<P><EM> &gt; Well this is what I am getting at: in these &quot;paradoxes&quot; that I keep
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hearing about, and that you describe above, all that is really going
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; on is that someone may have quicker knowledge (i.e. see an event happen)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; before someone else who is relying on normal light (travelling at normal
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; lightspeed) to see the event. But the event already happened long ago.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the recipient's reference frame the event happened &quot;long ago&quot;.  In
<BR>
somebody else's reference frame, it hasn't happened at all yet--it's
<BR>
going to happen in the future.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; What I mean is the difference between someone watching a moon landing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in 1969 on TV vs. someone watching it on Alpha Centauri many years later.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; In either case there is a delay, and even if you had instant (FTL) TV
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; signals from the moon to your TV in 1969 there still is no way that I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; see that you actually are going &quot;back in time&quot; or causing any kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; paradox.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you're on Earth, or on Alpha Centauri, you don't see a problem.
<BR>
But if you're in a spaceship heading from Alpha Centauri to Earth (I
<BR>
think that's the right direction) at a relativistic speed, you'll see
<BR>
the effect precede the cause.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Perhaps if you explained it in terms of TV I would understand ? :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; So what if someone sees me react to something that for them hasn't
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; even been transmitted yet? They just need a faster TV connection!
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, if they see the effect soon enough before the cause, they can
<BR>
send some information back to the cause, and prevent the cause from
<BR>
happening.  But then how did they ever see the effect?
<BR>
<P>Not to take your suggestion too literally, but: you know how movies
<BR>
like Back to the Future never really make any sense?  The basic idea
<BR>
here is not &quot;FTL communication is forbidden because we don't like it
<BR>
and it's just an arbitrary restriction&quot;; it's &quot;FTL communication is
<BR>
forbidden because Back-to-the-Future-like stuff would start happening,
<BR>
and Back-to-the-Future-like stuff doesn't make any sense.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; There is no reversal of cause and effect though. Once an event has
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; happened (say a car wreck), there is no way to make it not happen.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; In my uneducated opinion :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  And that is why FTL communication must not be
<BR>
possible.  Otherwise, you _could_ send a signal back that could
<BR>
prevent an event that has already happened.

<EM> &gt; Maybe they do have a reason, but neither they nor anyone here has

</EM><BR>
<P>Well, maybe they haven't been able to explain it in a way that will
<BR>
convince you :)  However, people who are actually experts on these

subjects are quite convinced.  If you can show that they're wrong,

there's probably a Nobel Prize in it for you.

Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight.
