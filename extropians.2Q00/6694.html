<P>
I'm afraid I'd get paid too much money.
<BR>
<P>Actually, I've seriously contemplated it in recent times; it's not too hard
<BR>
(relatively speaking) for a computer geek to get him/herself (and family?)
<BR>
into the US.
<BR>
<P>But I would far prefer to live in Australia; I've not found anything lacking
<BR>
here that is only available in the US, except maybe that my house doesn't
<BR>
seem to be able to get a cable modem. But I only have to move suburb to fix
<BR>
that. And it's a pretty lovely country. I highly recommend a visit
<BR>
sometime; unfortunately we have similarly draconian immigration laws, with
<BR>
no special rules for IT people, so it's hard to move here.
<BR>
<P>My current career goal (which is coming together rather nicely) is to have
<BR>
myself working directly for US companies via pure teleworking, while staying
<BR>
here. Nice exchange rate, you guys pay more, and all that. If I can get that
<BR>
stabilised, which I think I am doing, the next step is to expand into
<BR>
contracting other pure teleworking IT people, australians, working directly
<BR>
for US companies. It's something which people have been talking about
<BR>
(global employment market for knowledge work) for quite a while now, but has
<BR>
not yet been realised.
<BR>
<P>The eventual goal, of course, would be to enable workers living in really
<BR>
low cost of living countries to contract into the high cost of living, high
<BR>
paying US. For example, I know people who would like to work out of the
<BR>
Phillipines. Alternatively, it doesn't take long to find huge listings of
<BR>
eastern europeans on the net who are immensly skilled in IT and unable to
<BR>
find telework.
<BR>
<P>This is something which will happen, I am quite sure. Currently there are
<BR>
barriers to making this kind of employment possible, but they are by no
<BR>
means insurmountable. Mostly the barriers are attitudinal; these will change
<BR>
quickly as the practice of hiring pure teleworkers becomes more widespread.
<BR>
It will spread initially, for many areas of IT (esp software dev), because
<BR>
if you can get skilled people you will take them, however they come.
<BR>
Eventually the immense financial gains to all participants will be too
<BR>
obvious to disregard.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From my own experience, there are some hefty difficulties with telework, all
</EM><BR>
communication related. You've got to be a really proactive communicator to
<BR>
make it work; ideally people at both ends are! But they are surmountable,
<BR>
and become increasingly so as the 'net infrastructure improves.
<BR>
<P>Mmm, topic drift. Anyway, my point is, I can get the benefits (work/money)
<BR>
from here, keep the local benefits (lifestyle, less chance of getting shot),
<BR>
have fun in the process. Why on earth would I want to move?
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I am playing devil's advocate here... why aren't all you non-US folk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moving here? Laying aside for the moment the INS/immigration issues-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you could move here, why not? Most people seem to believe that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have pretty much the best freedom/interesting people/cheap real estate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the boonies/cheap gas/etc. etc. Have you become too dependent on your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free medical care that you are afraid you wouldn't be able to hack it
</EM><BR>
here?
