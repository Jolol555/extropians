<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Restrictions (was: RE: Transparency Debate)

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I would cut the gordian knot by first granting citizenship to Elian and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;posthumously to his mother in honor of her sacrifice and Elian's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffering.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I would then rule that primary custody still belongs with the father, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;that Elian should return to Cuba with the father, under the provision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;the Cuban government accept that Elian is free to return to the US when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;reaches the age of majority if he so wishes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe that the congress is planning to offer citizenship to Elian and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his father.  With full rights of being American citizens, does the father
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the right to return back to Cuba with his son?  The assumption always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems to be that nobody would want to go back if they didn't have to.  What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if the father is given a full range of legal options, and still choses to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take his family back to Cuba?  Would that be acceptable to the people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wanting to keep Elian here?
</EM><BR>
<P>Its pretty widely accepted that the Cuban American community is making a
<BR>
severe case here, however considering the extent of the losses they have
<BR>
incurred due to the communist government, their attitude is quite
<BR>
understandable. Clinton is under pressure from American resort interests
<BR>
to open up to cuba, since the europeans have been there for a decade or
<BR>
more, but the C-A community is wealthy and connected. They literally
<BR>
hate liberals because of many betrayals, going all the way back to the
<BR>
Kennedy's cowardly failure to support the Bay of Pigs invasion with air
<BR>
cover. Considerin how much in league with Castro Ted Turner is, I can't
<BR>
help but sympathize with them. 
<BR>
<P>Giving Elian citizenship will help make sure that he can come back, and
<BR>
sending him with his father will make sure that the several dozen
<BR>
american children that bave been abducted by cuban non-custodial parents
<BR>
will have a better chance to be repatriated through the international
<BR>
court system.
