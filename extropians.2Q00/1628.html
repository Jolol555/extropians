<EM> &gt; &gt; Now, would you like to explain exactly how your suggestion would result
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; in a successful resolution of the Irish problem? If you can convince us,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; then I suggest you will not find the Prime Minister and the Taioseach
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; uninterested. (They -- and their predecessors -- have been looking for a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; solution for the past three decades, at great personal risk.) If you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; can't suggest a solution, may I submit that the smart thing to do would
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; be in future to do your research _before_ you open your mouth in public?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The unfortunate problem, Charlie, is that the northern group looks upon
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; itself as 'english', not 'irish', so the solution is to get ALL of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 'english' out of Ireland.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; To paraphrase Longshanks:&quot;The problem with Ireland is that its full of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Englishmen.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Heh. I had to laugh when I read this. But, nice guy that I am, instead of
<BR>
slagging off your ignorance, I'm going to let you know what the real
<BR>
situation is.
<BR>
<P>To cut a long story short,  long ago the northern area of Eire was colonised
<BR>
by the British military. Obviously the natives were not impressed. Since
<BR>
then &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; has existed as a state in it's own right. In the
<BR>
meantime, the populace of NI have gone two ways. One group, &quot;republicans&quot;,
<BR>
want control of Northern Ireland for themselves (naturally - everyone wants
<BR>
to rule, right?), and their method of achieving this is by bombing innocent
<BR>
members of the public in NI and the rest of the UK (this has included many
<BR>
children). THERE IS NO GROUP THAT WANTS NI TO JOIN EIRE, this will never
<BR>
happen, it is not the issue. It's a juvenile flag-grab, that's all. On top
<BR>
of all the bombings is a regime of &quot;kneecapping&quot; (blasting the unfortunate
<BR>
victims kneecaps off from the back of the knee - crippling for life), which
<BR>
is the standard punishment for anti-republican activities. The other group
<BR>
are the &quot;loyalists&quot;. They are strangely apprehensive of removing the current
<BR>
British government and replacing it with a bunch of bomb crazy kneecapping
<BR>
arbitrarily power hungry lunatics (emotive yes, but undeniably true).
<BR>
THIS is the crux of the problem. The fact that the populace of NI are split.
<BR>
The British government wants nothing more than to wash it's hands of NI
<BR>
forever after all the troubles, but they can't just hand the country over to
<BR>
the terrorists, leaving the other half of the populace under the control of
<BR>
nutters against their will. They all are, after all British citizens, and
<BR>
the government absolutely cannot condemn it's citizens to such a fate just
<BR>
because some juvenile megalomanic vermin threaten to blow some people up.
<BR>
There is no &quot;Irish&quot; problem in NI, and there is no &quot;English&quot; problem in NI,
<BR>
it's entirely an NI problem. The leaders of the republicans see an
<BR>
opportunity to rule, and the followers are either blindly following a
<BR>
movement for the opportunities for violence, or they're so idiotic that
<BR>
changing the colour of a flag is deemed more important than thousands upon
<BR>
thousands of innocent peoples' lives.
<BR>
<P>It really doesn't help the situation to have the damned Americans funding
<BR>
the bastard IRA under the delusion that they represent a native struggle
<BR>
against British oppression, which is exactly what the republicans want us
<BR>
all to believe. Simply not true. I live in England, and I can tell you that
<BR>
the government are if anything, a bit wet - certainly anything but an
<BR>
oppressive regime. The loyalists know that their current government is
<BR>
vastly superior to any terrorist organisation, and you can see this in the
<BR>
fact that loyalists - protestants and republicans - catholics no longer
<BR>
correlate as they once did. Everyone is sick to the back teeth of this IRA
<BR>
shit, and a great many including myself would have liked to have seen wider
<BR>
use of the 80's &quot;shoot to kill&quot; policy of the SAS.
<BR>
<P>Err.....rant over.
