<EM>&gt;     &gt; What is death?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Having a last thought. The original can think my thoughts just as well as
</EM><BR>
me the copy,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; so as long as the original lives there is no last thought.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm afraid I detect circular logic here.  You believe that the copy and the
<BR>
original are the same person.  Therefore, you believe that the original can
<BR>
think the copy's thoughts because they are the same person.  Therefore, you
<BR>
believe that there is no last thought.  This is a self-referencing arguments
<BR>
that only works if you already believe as you do.
<BR>
<P>Suppose you believed the original and the copy are separate people.  You
<BR>
would then think that the original might diverge from thinking the same
<BR>
thoughts as the copy.  Therefore you might believe that there would be a
<BR>
last thought if one of the copies were killed.  Your explanation only
<BR>
reinforces your own belief.  It does not influence those who hold different
<BR>
beliefs.  It is similar to quoting the Bible or referring to God while
<BR>
debating an atheist.  It doesn't have the effect on the atheist as it does
<BR>
on the believer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In almost all of the sort of thought experiments we see on this list we
</EM><BR>
are invited
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to assume the part of the original and asked what our disposition toward
</EM><BR>
the copy
<BR>
<EM>&gt; should be. Why is that? You could just as easily take the role of the
</EM><BR>
copy, made
<BR>
<EM>&gt; one hour ago complete with memories of when you were a child. So now, what
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you going to do about the original?
</EM><BR>
<P>I see no difference no reason why the copy or the original should act or be
<BR>
treated differently.  I believe other people have made similar statements.
<BR>
For those who believe that both the copy and the original should live, it
<BR>
doesn't matter which is the original.  Only those who want to upload into a
<BR>
better body seem to want to kill the original (inferior) body after
<BR>
uploading.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;To me, what I am avoiding is loss of control.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That sounds like free will and that does not compute.  There are only two
</EM><BR>
possibilities,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; everything you do is because of cause and effect and you're a machine, or
</EM><BR>
it does
<BR>
<EM>&gt; not and you're random. Either way you don't control anything, but it
</EM><BR>
doesn't matter
<BR>
<EM>&gt; because you feel like you do.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not require free will for my viewpoint, and you are correct when you
<BR>
state that it does not matter.  If I have free will, or I think I have free
<BR>
will, or I claim to think I have free will, or I think I don't have free
<BR>
will, doesn't matter.  Whatever I think of free will, I would like these
<BR>
thoughts to go on.  I do not want to have a final thought on free will, so
<BR>
my desire is the same as yours to avoid a final thought.
