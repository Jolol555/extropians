<P><EM>    &gt;The fact is that  Windows is a really lousy product in comparison to other
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;products out there,
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll tell you a product that's really lousy, Be. You can't do anything with it because
<BR>
nothing is written for it, it's like a beautiful house with no plumbing of furniture.
<BR>
Someday that might change and there would be as much stuff for it as windows,
<BR>
but by then somebody would have written a completely new operating system
<BR>
and academics would be complaining how inelegant Be is. The most popular
<BR>
operating system will never be the newest or the one that uses the most
<BR>
advanced technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;MS has managed to capture its market has been through criminal behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; - e.g., it's attempted stealing of Stacker for DOS 6.0
</EM><BR>
<P>Is that the best you could come up with? Microsoft got into trouble because  they violated
<BR>
Stackers &quot;look and feel&quot;, the only thing dumber is the patent on business plans or
<BR>
Amazons patent on one click shopping. Anyway, I hope you're not saying that Microsoft
<BR>
is where it is today because of disk compression, dose anybody even use that shit anymore?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;MS is a corporation, a legal child of the  state, that sells bigtime to state entities.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course Microsoft sells to the state,  it makes an important product and  sells to everybody,
<BR>
but to claim that the reason for their success is unfair favorable treatment by government is
<BR>
nuts. Name me a company that has less to do with the military or relays less on government
<BR>
contracts than Microsoft.
