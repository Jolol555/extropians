<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Death to 7 of 9, the Borg, Data, and Spock, proud upholders of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; frickin' *stupid* tradition that intelligent people are supposed to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; unable to understand emotions.  Hail Gene Roddenbury, who managed to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; more damage to American rationality than, well, just about anyone.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Oh, faaar too harsh on Roddenberry, Eliezer, waaay too negative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; GR's work had its shortcomings, but recall he was writing for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; television
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Roddenberry suggested a future in which humanity was working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; out problems, fixing things, overcoming.  Humans were not perfect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by any means, and yes, one did wish Spock had strangled Kirk that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; time Spock got horny and challenged him to a dual.  And one wished
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that when Kirk was doing it with some green chick she would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; transmogrify into Q.  That'd fix him.  {8^D
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But all in all, for 1967 it was one helllll of a cool series.  Homo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sapiens
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Roddenberry might be excused for not knowing, but the damage is done.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conflation of irrational with emotional and rational with unemotional,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sadly, has a longer history than Mr. Spock, extending back to the Ancients,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but _Star Trek_ gave it a concrete portrayal that people confuse with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even though I agree with Eleizer, the problem should not be assigning blame.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Instead, it's how to overcome the stereotype here and now.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>I prefer to look at Star Trek as an allegory in which the different
<BR>
characters are archetypes for aspects of humanity.  It is possible, as
<BR>
I think Robert Anton Wilson has suggested, to view the principal Star
<BR>
Trek characters as emblems of various aspects of consciousness, with
<BR>
the Enterprise itself serving as one of them.  Leary's eightfold
<BR>
consciousness model works decently here.  I should think this might be
<BR>
of particular interest to Eliezer with his thinking aboud &quot;domdules&quot;
<BR>
of consciousness.  Once you view Star Trek as a story about the way
<BR>
that human consciousness grapples with the unknown in a sort of silly
<BR>
sci-fi allegory, it becomes a lot more fun, I think.
<BR>
<P>All the best!
