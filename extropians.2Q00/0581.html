<EM>&gt; I can actually feel both sides of this issue, but if it were up to me, I

<EM>&gt; would have waited until MS actually abused their power in a big way before
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; pulled the rug out.  I know Netscape would argue that they *did* abuse
</EM><BR>
their
<BR>
<EM>&gt; power.  But I don't buy that.  They were just way competitive and like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everybody else in the world they used their strengths for their own
</EM><BR>
benefit.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;   I would have waited until they did something really dastardly, like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting us all hooked on IE as freeware and then charging for it.  Or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crushing all contenders in the OS field and then gouging the consumer with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exhorbitant prices or a pay-per-use or software rental scheme
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (like I hear they're working on).
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.
<BR>
<P>Of course, I also think you wouldn't need government intervention to change
<BR>
things at that point - if MS tried to act like a monopolist (i.e. gouge
<BR>
customers, stop releasing product upgrades, etc), there would be an
<BR>
immediate stampede towards whatever alternative looked most viable at the
<BR>
time.
