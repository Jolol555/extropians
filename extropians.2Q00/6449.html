<P>[stuff snipped]
<BR>
<P>(Though this may be a little off-topic from what your post was about)
<BR>
I think it's very important to be familiar with the green party's platform. 
<BR>
I looked at it a few days ago, it's at <A HREF="http://www.greenparty.org">http://www.greenparty.org</A>. I was 
<BR>
really stuck at how scary it was. I knew it would be pretty bad, but I could 
<BR>
not believe the aggresive backwardsness of it. It's not just their positions 
<BR>
on genetic engineering - that is actually fairly tame compared to the rest 
<BR>
of what they endorse. Anyone considering voting for Nader as a protest vote, 
<BR>
PLEASE familiarize yourself with their platform. I do not doubt that if 
<BR>
enacted, the mass starvation, death, and curtailing of freedoms that would 
<BR>
result would put Mao and Hitler to shame.
<BR>
Their economic plan consists, among other things, of setting a maximum wage, 
<BR>
at 10x the minimum wage. They state 20,000$ as a minimum guaranteed yearly 
<BR>
income, so this means the most anyone could ever earn would be 
<BR>
$200,000/year. By simply taxing everything you make over the maximum wage at 
<BR>
a 100% tax rate (what a euphamism), they expect to pay the guaranteed 
<BR>
20,000$ minimum income for everyone, as well as fund a host of other social 
<BR>
programs. They state figures of wealth made by billionaires to show how much 
<BR>
money this would result in, by taxing these billionaires at 100%. The 
<BR>
logical flaw in this plan is so rage-inducingly obvious that I'm not going 
<BR>
to mention it. They have the gall to state, in the same section, 
<BR>
&quot;State-bureaucratic command economies like those which once dominated 
<BR>
Eastern Europe are no alternative to capitalism.&quot;
<BR>
Another economic goal is &quot;to eliminate harassment, unequal opportunity for 
<BR>
advancement, and pay differentials based on sex, age, race, ethnicity, 
<BR>
sexual orientation, religion, and physical or MENTAL ABILITIES&quot; (caps mine). 
<BR>
Whether the government can try to combate racism, sexism, and homophobia 
<BR>
through bans of discrimination is something I disagree with, but I waffle on 
<BR>
it sometimes, thinking that maybe a little coercion is preventing a lot of 
<BR>
bad, but mental ability? How can you want anything except to maximize 
<BR>
discrimination based on mental ability?
<BR>
This particular point on &quot;direct action&quot; (another great euphamism) is not 
<BR>
veiled very well: &quot;We neither condemn nor publicly advocate monkeywrenching 
<BR>
(a term for direct action in support of the Earth taken from the title of an 
<BR>
Edward Abbey novel), believing that such forms of resistance and creative 
<BR>
sabotage should be left to individuals and their own consciences.&quot; [There's 
<BR>
no polite or legal way to phrase what I want to say about this advice, so 
<BR>
I'm leaving it out].
<BR>
Their educational platform (read it) is of the type which is already being 
<BR>
slowly integrated into public schools, which results in a disdain for 
<BR>
superior ability, exclusion of the most intelligent, and ultimately school 
<BR>
shootings (I have a feeling this may spinoff into a seperate topic - don't 
<BR>
forget the &quot;GUNS:&quot; tag). The center of their curriculum would be study of 
<BR>
the local environment.
<BR>
This is very scary and sad. I do not think that the green party will ever 
<BR>
win the presidency, but I understand they hold many local offices, and I 
<BR>
don't think that a few seats in the house is unbelievable for the future. 
<BR>
Nader could get maybe 5% of the vote this year, and if things ever got 
<BR>
really bad in the years to come, maybe they could take second place, but 
<BR>
before that happened, the republican and democratic parties would see the 
<BR>
threat and adopt many of their ideas into their own platforms, and this is 
<BR>
the real danger. I would hope that at this point, they would merge into one 
<BR>
party. At least they're *somewhat practical*.
<BR>
<P>The green party platform (if you don't want to navigate their site) can be 
<BR>
found directly here:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.greenparty.org/program.html">http://www.greenparty.org/program.html</A>
<BR>
<P>At the same time, the Libertarian Party becomes a sadder and sadder 
<BR>
spectacle each day. Their press releases (you have to go to their page for 
<BR>
them, www.lp.org, because they get no press coverage) become more and more 
<BR>
dorky - I think whoever is writing them got his start in radio commercials. 
<BR>
Harry Browne's presidential campaign was suspended for about a month from 
<BR>
lack of funds, and the fact that he showed up in two national polls (at 0.8% 
<BR>
nationally and 2% in Oregon) led his campaign manager to announce &quot;It's been 
<BR>
a wild few weeks, but the Harry Browne campaign is stronger than ever.&quot; 
<BR>
Showing up in these polls at all represented &quot;a breakthrough for the 
<BR>
campaign.&quot; The polls were conducted by Zogby International and The Portland 
<BR>
Oregonian.
