<EM>&gt; &gt; Just because a bunch of companies get together and issue a 'standard' does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not mean that their work should have any special protections, or that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; everyone should immediately adopt it.

<EM>&gt; HTML was not made by a company.  It was first written by a scientist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking for a better way to share information, and freely given away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There was no commercial incentive - at least, not until Netscape came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; along.  A number of other widely-supported computer standards - HTTP and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux, to name a couple of the more popular ones - similarly had no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporate backing before they became popular enough for companies to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take notice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>A government is a monopoly corporation, and that scientist worked for a
<BR>
government institution.
<BR>
<P>Of course that picking nits, but the HTML standard created by CERN would
<BR>
never have gotten anywhere outside of CERN if some companies had not
<BR>
jumped on the bandwagon. Netscape has had tremendous influence on the
<BR>
evolution of HTML (now in its version 4.0 implementation, I believe, a
<BR>
far cry from CERN's version 1.0), as have other companies. These other
<BR>
companies all decided to cry and whine when Microsoft came in and
<BR>
developed its own standards and its own variations on interpreting the
<BR>
standard tags (just as ALL browsers do. none display the same page in
<BR>
exactlyt he same way) microsft came out with ActiveX, and all of the
<BR>
Mac=heads who hated microsoft who worked in these new browser companies
<BR>
(i.e. mostly students right out of school, where they used macs almost
<BR>
exclusively) automatically rejected the standard, rather than embracing
<BR>
it, just because it came from microsoft.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Portability standards, like Java, HTML or POSIX, are essentially marketing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; efforts launched by coalitions of companies who do not have enough market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; share to be viable competitors by themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Interoperability standards, like TCP and HTTP, are another matter. Because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their purpose is to allow products from different vendors to work together,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it is usually in everyone's best interests to fully codify and support them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I submit the up-and-coming Wireless Application Protocol as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counterexample.  It's an interoperability standard that, at its start,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was launched by Unwired Planet (now Phone.com) and whoever it could beg
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into supporting.  WAP is sufficiently unstable that, aside from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Phone.com, practically everyone who officially supports WAP also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supports WAP's competitors - for instance, UDP/IP.
</EM><BR>
<P>So we should all support an 'unstable' standard simply for the sake of
<BR>
keeping competition around? The point of competition is to determine who
<BR>
is best in a particular market segment. Losers should not be kept around
<BR>
except in a Museum of Innovation Losers. Keeping poor alternatives
<BR>
around creates economic drag.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No one is *entrusted* with anything in a free market. Commercial entities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can only control a vital technology if they are actually doing a decent job
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of managing it, because the moment they begin making mistakes they create an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; opportunity for rivals to make big money by fixing things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So long as the screw-ups haven't placed so many barriers to leaving -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for instance, holding the domain name they bought for you even after you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; send notice to NSI that the ISP no longer has your business and thus no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longer has a right to your trademark, or just plain buying up the ISP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you were going to switch to - that switching becomes financially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infeasable.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you were dumb enough to have your ISP register your domain name for
<BR>
you, and they paid for it and put it on your bill from them, then you
<BR>
deserve to get screwed. I always find out the DNS numbers for my ISP,
<BR>
then register my own names and point them at my ISP's servers. I notify
<BR>
the ISP I am doing this, and I create a domain directory for them on my
<BR>
portion of their servers. THus I remain in control.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (such as because Microsoft's are buggy and insecure).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ten years ago this remark would have been on target. Five years ago the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; matter would have been arguable. Today it is simply ignorant prejudice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Microsoft's current performance in both these areas is in the top 25% of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; industry, and still improving at a steady rate. They aren't the best in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; world, but they are much better than average, and unless the Unix vendors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; get their collective act together they *will* be the best in another five
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; years or so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...by virtue of having bought up or run out of business all competition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that did have their act together.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the competition did not beleive in the validity of their product, and
<BR>
only cared about money, then their technology and their business
<BR>
practices obviously did not 'have their act together'. If you know your
<BR>
product is best, you shouldn't surrender until you are living in a shack
<BR>
(been there, done that). Someone who takes the money and runs is not the
<BR>
kind of advocate for their technology that is likely to get them to the
<BR>
top to begin with, and their product deserves to be under the control of
<BR>
someone who will put it to its best use.
