<EM>&gt;land
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the planet:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 20,000,000,000,000, or 20 trillion cameras
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;lots of ranting about the non-feasibility of ubiquitous surveillance 
<BR>
snipped&gt;
<BR>
<P>It might help to keep in mind a couple of things:
<BR>
<P>There are lots of ways to skin a cat.  Ubiquitous surveillance does not 
<BR>
necessarily mean that there will be a Sony camcorder installed every square 
<BR>
20 feet all over the surface of the globe, or that the cameras which are 
<BR>
deployed will necessarily be constantly recording every minute of every day. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It would make more sense to have only 1 or 2 cameras per person (worn on 
<BR>
the wrist--watch style, or perhaps following you around like a gnat, or 
<BR>
pointing at you from satellites overhead, or perhaps any one of several 
<BR>
other ways).  This would limit the cameras now to approx. 12 billion max 
<BR>
(*significantly* less than 20 trillion).
<BR>
<P>Moreover if you fixed it so that the cameras only started &quot;rolling&quot; when the 
<BR>
subject did certain specified activities (say, communicating or interacting 
<BR>
with a person, computer or near-anything device) you could save oodles of 
<BR>
recording time (and storage space).
<BR>
<P>But probably the biggest thing to keep in mind is that we are talking about 
<BR>
tomorrow's problems, tomorrow's solutions and *tomorrow's* technology.  So 
<BR>
even if this type of surveillance is not available with today's technology, 
<BR>
that has little bearing on whether it will be feasible when its needed.  And 
<BR>
once we get to, or even close to, the singularity *all* bets are off 
<BR>
regarding what technology will and will not be able to do.
<BR>
<P>Lastly, for those on the list who just absolutely *can't* wrap their minds 
<BR>
around the fact that a great deal of the surveillance technology we have 
<BR>
been discussing is, if not available today, just around the corner, I might 
<BR>
suggest this sobering book:
