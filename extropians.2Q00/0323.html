<EM>&gt; The debate over Elian is disgusting.  While I typed this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; message, around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forty children died, thirty of them from starvation.  Militarily, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least, we have more than enough strength to go into those 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countries and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knock over the tinpot dictators.  We don't.  Why?  Because it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upset the international teapot, give the US a big honkin' 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; black mark in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the UN's book, make *big* dictatorships like China extremely nervous,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and up the probability of nuclear war by a few points.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Considering that the US setup and feeds half of those tinpot dictatorships,
<BR>
it would also be rather self-defeating.  The US has proven many times that
<BR>
it doesn't care what the UN thinks of its actions (i'm not saying this is a
<BR>
bad thing).
<BR>
The thing that bothers me is that while you are in
<BR>
Singularity-creation-mode, your moral objectivism is subdued by the fact
<BR>
that you admit that you have no smidgin of an idea of what this objective
<BR>
moral code would be, but when you switch to analysis of everyday affairs,
<BR>
you forget about your ignorant condition and transform yourself into the
<BR>
classical american asshole who thinks he knows what's best for the world and
<BR>
how the US should go about making it so. but of course, you weren't
<BR>
advocating a decision one way or the other.

(Child of a tinpot dictatorship country partly setup, partly fed, and partly
<BR>
fucked by the US.  Of course, the natives did the rest)
