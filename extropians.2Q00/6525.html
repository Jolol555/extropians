<P><EM>&gt;  Curt, you're right of course...clumsy English again! But the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;incompatibility&quot; is really (i) diminishing (cost/benefit) returns to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  maintaining reproductive ability when viable progeny is extant... 
</EM><BR>
<P>Sib competition as a selective force for aging is an interesting idea.  But
<BR>
I had in mind tradeoffs where reproducing per se shortens lifespan.
<BR>
Linda Partridge has shown that is the case in D. melanogaster, at least.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;and (ii)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the negative benefits of loading the genepool with archaic combinations in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the face of rapid environmental change....
</EM><BR>
<P>Man, it seems like I have this argument a lot!  That's
<BR>
not really a problem; if the archaic combinations are
<BR>
bad, the possessors will be dead anyway. Often, the
<BR>
archaic combinations will carry valuable information
<BR>
which is being lost due to fluctuating selection or drift.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Some long lived complex species: tortoises; macaws; elephants; humans seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to have real advantages for the coexistence in a population of several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;generations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Memetic-genetic coevolution would certainly change the game; in macaws,
<BR>
elephants, and humans there's a lot of intergenerational knowledge transfer.
<BR>
That's a pretty open field theoretically and experimentally (although 
<BR>
multigenerational selection experiments on elephants certainly have some
<BR>
technical difficulties! :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But generational depth is almost nonexistent in many real populations... the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;species seem to favour short life and develop interesting mechanisms to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;foster death.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not aware of mechanisms to foster death except in species that reproduce
<BR>
once only, like salmon and annual plants.  Even there a strong theoretical
<BR>
case holds that the mechanisms don't actively foster death, there's just
<BR>
no selective reason to stop them (Pletcher and Curtsinger, 1998)  You 
<BR>
do see mechanism that increase fertility and death rates; but I'd call them
<BR>
fertility mechanisms: the mortality is a unaoidable side effect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But then they STILL eventually age and die when captive reared  in suitable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;habitats. Is ageing different then... are they coming up against cellular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ageing constraints specific to the genetic complexities of being a metazoan?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not being a metazoan per se - metazoans that reproduce by fission often
<BR>
have no aging, just a constant death rate (Michael Rose, &quot;Evolutionary
<BR>
Biology of Aging&quot;)  Rose maintains, and I agree, that aging is a 
<BR>
semi-necessary
<BR>
consequence of non-fission reproduction.  When it's an option to off the
<BR>
current organism in favor of its offspring, there will usually be some 
<BR>
circumstances
<BR>
in which that is selectively favored.  The existence of many such traits forms
<BR>
aging.
