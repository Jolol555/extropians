<EM>&gt; &gt; Normal evolution is not deliberately directed, it progresses in the

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; I disagree.  There seems to be evidence of orthogenetic (not a typo; I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NOT mean ontogenetic here) processes in evolution.  E.g., back and forth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mutation rates are usually not equal.  (Drisophilia antennae mutate into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legs usually.  Very rarely do we see the reverse.)  There are other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; examples.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you may be misinterpreting Anders statement.  I believe he is
<BR>
saying that there is &quot;no memory&quot; with regard to what previously may
<BR>
have worked in an environment.  Nature can develop something, it can
<BR>
work for a while, get lost and then be reinvented.  The local optimal
<BR>
adaptions may be reinvented many times from many directions, &quot;eyes&quot;
<BR>
and &quot;flight&quot; for example.
<BR>
<P>When discussing mutations you have to be careful to avoid overgeneralizing.
<BR>
Mutations in specific base pairs, amino acids and gene sequences and
<BR>
arrangements (such as the homeobox genes) are all governed by different
<BR>
processes that are environment and genome specific.  For example, there
<BR>
are gene rearrangement &quot;effectors&quot; in Drosophila that do not exist
<BR>
in other species.  There may be hyper-mutation stress responses in
<BR>
bacteria that do not exist in other species.  The entire history
<BR>
of mammalian genomes is an interesting study in the development and
<BR>
divergence of retrotransposible elements and random chromosome
<BR>
rearrangements.  The genome and gene duplications that allow the
<BR>
evolution of increased diversity are not easily &quot;reversed&quot;.
<BR>
<P>There may be no &quot;memory&quot; in genomes, but there is a &quot;history&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It might be better to say that evolution appears to be &quot;blind&quot; in terms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fitting the environment.  The internal (to the genomic system or organism or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; species) mechanisms producing diversity do not appear to &quot;know&quot; about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment.
</EM><BR>
<P>The bacterial &quot;stress&quot; responses would seem to contradict this.  Genome
<BR>
histories seem to retain the fact that when the environment gets difficult, you
<BR>
want to increase the mutation rate to increase the probability of survival.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Intelligent entities are capable of creating systems based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; earlier experience and make deliberate jumps in form space that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be unlikely with undirected evolution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The use of &quot;undirected&quot; here can be misleading.  I would say a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolutionary processes are directed, but not in the sense of there being a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conscious goal.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would disagree.  They are &quot;directed&quot; only in the sense that they try
<BR>
all possible variations from a particular state.  Anders is commenting
<BR>
on the problem of conciousness determining that a local optima has been
<BR>
reached that cannot be transcended by simple random variations.  You have to
<BR>
have conscious &quot;sight&quot; to see that there are nearby &quot;peaks&quot; that are higher
<BR>
than the local situation and determine how to &quot;leap&quot; over to those peaks.
<BR>
The real problem is that evolution cannot backtrack!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Instead, what I mean is that the initial conditions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; biological evolution (for each of us, our initial condition is our genetics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and cytoplasm at birth; for a population of organisms, the initial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conditions are its genome, which is typically nonrandom) constrain in which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directions variation will take place.  This sets the ground on which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environmental fitness (boundary conditions) can act.
</EM><BR>
<P>Precisely.  This &quot;ground&quot; is the limited space in which evolution
<BR>
can occur and it requires consciousness to see the unoccupied spaces.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think in a lot of areas, we could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefit from using things like evolutionary computation because minds are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constrained too.
</EM><BR>
<P>Clearly the approaches are complementary.  All &quot;conscious&quot; approaches
<BR>
may suffer from blind spots.  Evolution suffers from limited &quot;foundations&quot;
<BR>
(occupation points in the phase space).  The question is whether there
<BR>
are mathematical approaches that can be clearly defined to search the
<BR>
phase space, avoiding the blind spots and exploring the undeveloped
<BR>
foundations?
