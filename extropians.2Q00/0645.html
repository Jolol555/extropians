<EM>&gt; On Tue, 11 Apr 2000, you wrote:

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; All real power is based in force or the threat of force,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;No, it isn't. Those who try to ignore the objective reality of natural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;law have to use force to fight against that objective reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know what you're talking about here - what's a natural law in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this context? And anyway, so what if there are some? Maybe universal emergent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; principles. Who says we shouldn't fight against them? Gravity's an objective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality, that doesn't make airplanes impossible or useless.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suggest you study some more political science, with a focus on natural
<BR>
law, and see how the natural laws of science apply to natural laws of
<BR>
political power and liberty.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;So as I've said, people who think like you buy the precept of &quot;People
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;are no damn good and need to be kept penned up for their 'own good'.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No. As long as you're not hurting anyone else, do what you want. Buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the guns you want - whatever totem it takes to ward of the black
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helicopters - so long as you don't shoot anyone it's none of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business. What I do think is necessary though are mechanisms to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevent abuse of power, be that physical power, economic power, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever.
</EM><BR>
<P>Economic can always be countered by ingenuity and the freedom to choose
<BR>
where to spend your own damn money. Government tries to limit these as
<BR>
well. The only reason you support the dismantling of MS and not the
<BR>
enslavement of yourself is that at least its happening to the other guy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;You don't understand your own system. Your system is structured to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;maximize the possible bribes that dumb middle class and wealthy people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have to pay to cops, prosecutors, and mayors in order to get off or get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;light sentences when they break the law. Since there are SO many laws in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;NY, the average person can easily be found to be in violation of any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;number of laws without knowing it, and that makes the average person on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the street and easy victim for a police shakedown.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that there's a disturbing authoritarian trend, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solution is better government - not anarchy. I think you're being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disproportionately paranoid. They'll be a counter swing. Giuliani is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an example here - he swept in on a law and order platform, and now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public outrage over police brutality looks like it might nix his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; senate run.
</EM><BR>
<P>So a better, more comfortable harness is preferable by you over freedom.
<BR>
I see.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The rationale behind the latest hike was to discourage under age
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smoking, on the theory kids have less money to set fire to than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adults. The public health establishment views drinking, drug use,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smoking, etc. as diseases to be eradicated, polio style, by public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; policy. Social cost is just a useful argument. If the prohibitionists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gave more than lip service to social cost they'd take one look at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price of drug enforcement and prisons, not to mention the crime
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generated by a blackmarket economy and artificial inflated prices,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then give up.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you really think that realizing that will stop them?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Bullshit yourself. The principles of our democracy have gotten run over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;roughshod by the federal government for the last 3/4 century.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We've had unprecedented advances in rights for women and minorities,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social welfare, working conditions, and the largest economy in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world. Let rampant roughshod running reign. But you've ignored the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting question: What good is a constitution without a government? What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevents a private police force from searching your house without a warrant or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seizing your guns if a fickle market so demands?
</EM><BR>
<P>What good is a government without constitutional protections to prevent
<BR>
its abuse? A government that oversteps its bounds is as treasonous a
<BR>
government as an individual who sells secrets to the enemies of that
<BR>
nation or constitution or as an individual who would attempt to
<BR>
terrorize the populace. They all need to be removed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Government is not US, its 50.00000001% of us crushing everyone else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Thats the central fallacy of democracy. It doesn't represent everyone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;just those who voted for whoever is in power.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The majority doesn't become any less oppressive because they're voting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with their dollars instead of in an election. Why is Microsoft's use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of it's market power justified because people buy their product, yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government is oppressive because they do what people elect them to do?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Think about the analogy and what it implies for anarcho-capitalism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Because Microsoft having 50.0001% of the market doesn't mean they can
<BR>
force you to buy their product,  or shoot you and your family dead for
<BR>
refusing to buy it. Government can, has, and will continue to do this.
