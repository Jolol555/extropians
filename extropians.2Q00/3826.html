<P><P><P>A Theory of Universal Artificial Intelligence based on Algorithmic
<BR>
Complexity
<BR>
Marcus Hutter
<BR>
arXiv:cs.AI/0004001
<BR>
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/cs.AI/0004001">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/cs.AI/0004001</A>
<BR>
<P>What do you get when you combine decision theory and Solomonoff's
<BR>
theory of universal induction? This paper. The author studies agents
<BR>
acting in a probabilistic environment trying to maximise some utility;
<BR>
this is roughly equivalent to reinforcement learning and sequential
<BR>
decision theory. By adding ideas from algorithmic complexity he
<BR>
describes a model called AIxi that optimizes the utility in an
<BR>
arbitrary environment. Hutter claims that his AIxi model is the most
<BR>
intelligent unbiased agent possible. It only has the slight drawback
<BR>
of being uncomputable, so he constructs a modified algorithm that is
<BR>
still effectively more intelligent than any other time t and space l
<BR>
bounded agent.
<BR>
<P>Overall, a heavy paper I did not have the time to truly get into. I'm
<BR>
uncertain whether this is a significant big idea or just a lot of
<BR>
formalism. However, the ambition to describe the upper bounds of
<BR>
intelligence is interesting, and likely very relevant for our
<BR>
transhumanist ambitions.
<BR>
<P><P>Lunar Solar Power System: Review of the Technology Base of an
<BR>
Operational LSP System
<BR>
<P>David R. Criswell, Acta Astronautica 46:8 531-540 (2000)
<BR>
<P>Space power systems (SPS) collect solar energy in space and beam it to
<BR>
Earth using microwave beams. Here Criswell proposes a moon-based
<BR>
system and looks at how feasible it is given today's technology. The
<BR>
solar cells are nothing new, materials close at hand. Using phased
<BR>
arrays microwaves can be sent as nice beams, possibly reflected using
<BR>
satelites. It seems to be quite doable using today's technology. 
<BR>
<P><P>Menthol desensitization of capsaicin irritation: Evidence of a
<BR>
short-term anti-nociceptive effect
<BR>
<P>Barry G. Green and Betsy McAuliffe, Physiology &amp; Behavior 68 (2000) 631-639
<BR>
<P>Methol produces a cool or biting feeling in the mouth and nose. So how
<BR>
does it interact with the hot taste of capsaicin (the active
<BR>
ingredient in chili peppers)? Will they amplify each other, or will
<BR>
one of them decrease the feeling produced by the other? If menthol is
<BR>
given 15 minutes before exposure to capsaicin the irritation grows
<BR>
stronger. But as the interval decreases, the irritation grows
<BR>
weaker. When mixed with menthol, stronger capsaicin solutions did not
<BR>
feel as intense as weaker.  It appears that menthol can make the
<BR>
tounge less sensitive to capsaicin; they discuss whether this can be
<BR>
used in clinical treatments, but from a hedonic point of view this
<BR>
suggests interesting experiments in taste.
<BR>
<P><P>Current knowledge of the health benefits and disadvantages of wine
<BR>
consumption
<BR>
<P>John F. Tomera, Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology 10 (1999) 129-138
<BR>
<P>A review of the effects of various components in red and white
<BR>
wine. Overall it doesn't come to any firm conclusions, but a lot of
<BR>
interesting facts about the polyphenols, contaminants, heavy metals,
<BR>
claimed health benefits, known health problems etc.
<BR>
<P><P>L-theanine - a unique amino acid of green tea and its relaxation
<BR>
effect in humans
<BR>
<P>Lekh Raj Juneja, Djong-Chi Chu, Tsutomu Okubo, Yukiko Nagato and
<BR>
Hidehiko Yoyogoshi, Trends in Food Science and Technology 10 (1999)
<BR>
199-204
<BR>
<P>Green tea is healthy and said to be relaxing, but what constituents
<BR>
have what effects? This review paper claims that the amino acid
<BR>
theanine is responsible for the relaxation effect. The authors
<BR>
describe an experiment where volunteers given theanine exihibit more
<BR>
alpha-wave activity; I'm somewhat sceptical of their treatment of the
<BR>
EEG and the causality here. Theanine seems to reduce serotonin levels
<BR>
and significantly reduce blood pressure. It seems to improve learning
<BR>
somewhat in rats. Overall, this paper does not hold the standards
<BR>
found in (say) Psychopharmacology for testing, but it seems to point
<BR>
at an interesting new cognitive enhancer. 
<BR>
<P><P><P>Evolution of lifespan in C. elegans
<BR>
<P>David W. Walker, Gawain McColl, Nicole L. Jenkins, Jennifer Harris and
<BR>
Gordon J. Lithgow, Nature 405 18 May 2000 296-297
<BR>
<P>A letter to nature looking into the natural selection of aging. If
<BR>
genes like age-1 can be changed to produce a more long-lived animal,
<BR>
why haven't selection produced one? A likely explanation is that there
<BR>
is some evolutionary cost associated with this, making genes that are
<BR>
bad when you are old beneficial when you are young and vice versa.
<BR>
The authors tested this by growing a mixed population of C elegans
<BR>
under normal conditions and with periodic starvation. In the first
<BR>
case the frequency of long-lived and short-lived alleles did not
<BR>
change, but with the starvation the age-1 frequency
<BR>
decreased. Apparently it did have some disadvantage when subjected to
<BR>
starvation. A nice demonstration of the pleiotrope theory of aging.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Gene Expression Profile of Aging and Its Retardation by Caloric Restriction
<BR>
<P>Cheol-Koo Lee, Roger G. Klopp, Richard Weindruch and Tomas A. Prolla,
<BR>
Science vol 285 1390--1393 27 August 1999
<BR>
<P>The authors looked at which genes were expressed in aged mouse muscles
<BR>
compared to young mice, and found that for the most part the
<BR>
expression pattern was similar. Only 1.8% of the genes showed more
<BR>
than a two-fold change in expression due to age. Of the genes that
<BR>
increased in expression 16% were mediators of stress response and 9%
<BR>
neural growth related genes. Among the decreased genes 13% were
<BR>
involved in energy metabolism. When mice were put on caloric
<BR>
restriction the pattern changed noticeably. 29% of the age-related
<BR>
changes were completely prevented and 34% partially suppressed; of the
<BR>
four major gene classes affected by age 84% were completely or
<BR>
partially suppressed. It increased protein metabolism and biosynthesis
<BR>
genes, and decreased the activity of DNA repair, heat shock factors,
<BR>
detoxification systems and other damage repair systems. Overall, it
<BR>
sugegsts that CR has quite profound effects on the way cells act, and
<BR>
at least partially counteracts ageing.
<BR>
<P><P>Optimism and risk for job burnout among working college students:
<BR>
stress as a mediator
<BR>
<P>Edward C. Chang, Kevin L. Rand and Daniel R. Strunk, Personality and
<BR>
Individual Differences 29 (2000) 255-263
<BR>
<P>Optimism (the general expectation of positive outcomes) has been shown
<BR>
to be related to greater psychological and physical adjustment. Is it
<BR>
strong enough to decrease the stress that appears to be related to
<BR>
burnout? If you expect good things you will be less stressed, and this
<BR>
might make burnout less likely. The authors did a survey where they
<BR>
measured optimism, stress and brunout risk using standard tests. They
<BR>
found a significant negative correlation between optimism and
<BR>
perceived stress, exhaustion and cynicism and a positive correlation
<BR>
to feelings of efficacy. They explain the findings by a model where
<BR>
optimism decreases perceived stress, which in turn affects the factors
<BR>
leading to burnout. In short, practical optimism is a weapon in the
<BR>
fight against burnout, and if managers and organisers can make people
<BR>
more optimistic there is less stress and risk of burnout. 
<BR>
<P><P>Who reads self-help books? Development and validation of the self-help
<BR>
reading attitudes survey
<BR>
<P>Dawn M. Wilson and Thomans F. Cash, Personality and Individual
<BR>
Differences 29 (2000) 119-129
<BR>
<P>Exactly who reads self-help books and why? This paper presents a
<BR>
survey intended to study the attitudes of people to self-help. They
<BR>
tested it on 264 male and female students, getting an acceptable
<BR>
validity of the survey. Persons favorable to self-help books were in
<BR>
general more pro-reading , more psychologically minded, more oriented
<BR>
towards self-control and reported more life satisfaction. Women and
<BR>
psychology majors were more positive than others to self-help
<BR>
books. Noting truly unexpected, but nice to see things validated. How
<BR>
much the books help is another matter, it might be that people who
<BR>
need them less tend to be the ones who read them.
<BR>
<P><P>Second to fourth digit ratio in elite musicians: Evidence for musical
<BR>
ability as an hones stignal of male fitness
<BR>
<P>Vanessa A. Sluming and John T. Manning, Evolution and Human Behavior
<BR>
21 (2000) 1-9
<BR>
<P>The amount of testosterone during fetal development influences a lot
<BR>
of things, and may influence musical ability too. The ratio of the
<BR>
length of second and fourth digit may be related to prenatal
<BR>
testosterone levels and is negatively related to adult testosterone
<BR>
levels; at least one study has shown a link to sexual
<BR>
preferences. This study looked at the D2:D4 ratio among the members of
<BR>
a symphony orchestra. They found that the men had consistently lower
<BR>
ratio than the control group of non-musicians; female members did not
<BR>
differ significantly. There was no difference between different
<BR>
instruments, so it was not due to mechanical advantages. Among the
<BR>
violinists there is a ranking, and it was found that higher ranked
<BR>
violinists had lower D2:D4 ratio. The authors suggest that all this
<BR>
points at musical ability is sexually selected for in men, since it
<BR>
signifies a high level of testosterone and presumably good genes. I
<BR>
don't know how much one should make of this paper, but it definitely
<BR>
belong to the category 'fun' papers.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Population Migration and the Variation of Dopamine D4 Receptor (DRD4)
<BR>
Allele Frequencies Around the Globe
<BR>
<P>Chuansheng Chen, Michael Burton, Ellen Greenberger and Julia Dmitrieva
<BR>
<P>Evolution and Human Behavior 20: 309--324 (1999)
<BR>
<P>Some variants of the dopamine D4 receptor (long alleles) has been
<BR>
claimed to be linked with traits such as 'novelty-seeking' and a
<BR>
tendency to go exploring. Is there any differences in the D4 allele
<BR>
frequencies between different ethnic groups and does this have
<BR>
anything to do if they have migrated in the past? This study compiled
<BR>
data from 39 groups (2320 individuals) and found that compared to
<BR>
populations that had not moved much in the past migratory populations
<BR>
showed a higher proportion of long alleles of DRD4. There was a strong
<BR>
correlation (0.85) between long-range macromigration and a somewhat
<BR>
weaker but still relevant (0.52) correlation for having a nomadic
<BR>
lifestyle. This was apparently the only gene showing this kind of
<BR>
correlation. While one explanation might be that restless novelty
<BR>
seekers found new settlements and over time there is a founder
<BR>
selection, another possibility is that there is selection for this
<BR>
gene in a culture that is moving. It is this later conclusion this
<BR>
paper supports.
