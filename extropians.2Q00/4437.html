<EM>&gt;     &gt;MS, to me, represents  the triumph of a fundamentally idealess 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;moneyed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;yuppy oligarchy in using a  corrupt system to sell amazingly shoddy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;to an ignorant market. [...]  The Apple II was the WORST  possible 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;choice for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;an &quot;educational computer.&quot; [...] They put the money into  MARKETING,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;instead of product or R &amp; D. [...] also used dirty tricks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ok, so maybe everybody made a mistake but you, maybe Apple and Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make nothing but junk, maybe we should all be using a Commodore 64, maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you are smarter than the market, but my question to you is, do you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Janet Reno is as smart as you? And do you think Janet Reno is as moral as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so you can trust her not to use dirty tricks as those evil greedy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;multinational satanic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capitalistic corporations did?
</EM><BR>
<P>You think I trust Janet Reno?  Come on.  Don't put words in my mouth.  
<BR>
Sometimes even Hitler was right.  That doesn't mean that I support Nazism.  
<BR>
You just don't seem to realize that Microsoft is part of the same vicious, 
<BR>
corrupt system as Reno.  Let them go at it, I say.
<BR>
<P>&quot;everybody made a mistake but you&quot;?  I'm not defending Commodore - heaven 
<BR>
forbid.  They set a new standard for sleaze and double-dealing under 
<BR>
Tramiel.  Virtually everyone hated them during his reign, and for good 
<BR>
reason.  If they had reached the position that MicroSoft has, we would 
<BR>
probably be twice as bad off, minimum.  Except that Tramiel was so openly 
<BR>
arrogant and villianous that someone would have nuked him long before 
<BR>
that...  Jerry Pournelle, in his book on personal computers, would not even 
<BR>
mention Commodore, even though they dominated the market of the time.
<BR>
<P>The C64 outsold the Apple II by a major margin.  Check your history.  I 
<BR>
don't like being painted as a lone nut - especially when it's not true.  It 
<BR>
was the most popular single model of personal computer ever made.  And, who 
<BR>
bought it?  Individual users and private schools.  Who bought the majority 
<BR>
of Apple II's?  State purchasing agents.  I consulted with private schools 
<BR>
during that period.  The few who put out the big bucks for the Apples had to 
<BR>
drag most of the kids to them.  They had to lock the kids out of the rooms 
<BR>
with C64's or Atari 800's.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;Don't outcompete, don't make a better product.  Just use the legal  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;costs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The very motto of Microsoft's competitors who are cheering the &quot;Justice&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;department thugs on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;This is the  kind of yuppy scum slease that I expect from our class 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;oligarchs who  treat everything as negotiable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As a charter member of Yuppie Scum Sleaze International I see nothing wrong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with negotiation and my goal is to make Justice a commodity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;As an anarcho-capitalist, objectivist libertarian from the '60's on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Good God, what happened to you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I learned my trade - professional revolutionary.  Trust is a commodity as 
<BR>
well.  Societies that treat everything as negotiable don't have much of that 
<BR>
commodity.  Stability, dependability are essential to good planning.  I can 
<BR>
cite many, many examples of the disasters coming out of the &quot;everything is 
<BR>
negotiable&quot; position.
<BR>
<P>China, for example.  For a couple millenia now, China had all the basic 
<BR>
capital to have made the leap forward to a modern society moving straight 
<BR>
toward the singularity.  The problem is that they always eat it all up 
<BR>
fighting themselves, until it reaches a terminal phase and a new hoard of 
<BR>
barbarians sweeps the corruption away and then quickly falls into the same 
<BR>
trap themselves.  Today the typical Chinese business has the Peoples Army as 
<BR>
a silent partner.  Yesterday, it was the local Mandarin official.  
<BR>
Regardless, a huge percentage of the productive capacity goes into paying 
<BR>
for &quot;protection.&quot;
<BR>
<P>What you want is to be able to depend upon contracts, including implicit 
<BR>
ones that a common law jury would support.  No one has the right to invite 
<BR>
you out on their boat and then extort from you to carry you back to shore.  
<BR>
It was implicit that you never would have gotten on the boat if that had 
<BR>
been the deal.  That's not a negotiable position.
<BR>
<P>Many non-Chinese companies who have tried to do business there recently have 
<BR>
gotten seriously burned when they discovered that to the typical Chinese 
<BR>
businessman contracts are just a statement of temporary convenience.  After 
<BR>
committing resources in good faith, they suddenly find themselves being 
<BR>
asked to renegotiate from a much weakened position.  (Then they discover 
<BR>
that the Chinese interns have faxed or emailed their entire business back 
<BR>
home, including all the intellectual property which was their stock in 
<BR>
trade.)
<BR>
<P>There are many ways to interpret the idea that everything is negotiable, and 
<BR>
some of them I would probably agree with.  Justice is a commodity in the 
<BR>
sense that it has to be provided by someone, hopefully at a mutual profit, 
<BR>
in a competitive market.  Justice, however, has a specific meaning.  It 
<BR>
isn't just whatever gunpower you can afford to hire, and if that's the way 
<BR>
it works in the society you live, then you're in a heap of trouble...  And 
<BR>
we are, but not beyond fixing.
