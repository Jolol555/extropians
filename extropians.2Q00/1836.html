<EM>&gt; In a message dated 4/28/2000 5:24:30 AM Pacific Daylight Time, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I discussed intelligence and emotion being in different realms.
</EM><BR>
<P>On Sat, 29 Apr 2000 <A HREF="mailto:QueeneMUSE@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20TSD:%20Emotion%20vs.%20Intellect%20[was:%20wee-little%20question%20...]&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.UW2.4.20.0004291737070.6948-100000@www.aeiveos.com&gt;">QueeneMUSE@aol.com</A> wrote:

<EM>&gt; This is not true. If nothing else, &quot;realms&quot; implies that there are spaces, or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rooms where we store thoughts and emotions. This is an illusion. Human 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cognition is a continuum constantly shifting from state to state. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't want to get into a discussion about what &quot;cognition&quot; is
<BR>
(because I don't know).  I will state that I can shift my attention
<BR>
from an awareness of &quot;feelings&quot; (that I consider to be emotions) to
<BR>
intellectual conclusions based on real experiences (that I consider
<BR>
to be rational thoughts).  As I am usually distinctly aware of the
<BR>
reasoning process from which the &quot;thoughts&quot; are derived, and unaware
<BR>
of the source of the emotions (other than attributing them to some
<BR>
black box in my lizard brain), I consider them different &quot;realms&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Your perception may vary (I suspect everyones' does).
<BR>
<P>It may have been a very poor choice of terms to equate &quot;rational thoughts&quot;
<BR>
with &quot;intelligence&quot;, but most of what I consider to be intelligence, I
<BR>
can provide a rational explanation for the thought process being conducted
<BR>
by the brain, while with emotions I am hard pressed to do that.  The
<BR>
best I can do is sometimes is point out a genetic agenda.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Although it is true that one can, through intelligence, become more skilled 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at emotion, it is not because intelligence is separate from emotion or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superincumbant. It is *possible* to subject and  &quot;master&quot; your conflicting 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emotions by pretending they are not a part of your intellect, but it's an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; error of judgment. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't particularly consider intelligence or emotion to be superincumbant.
<BR>
Nor do I consider it to be a good idea to attempt to &quot;master&quot; emotions,
<BR>
rather than simply experience them.  I do consider them separate because
<BR>
with one I can follow the process and the other I cannot.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Emotions are little understood and there for expression of emotions is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frowned upon in our culture.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats the culture, I actually like almost all of my emotions for the
<BR>
variety they bring to the table.  I actually enjoy crying at movies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is not OK to be conflicted, apparently. We are supposed to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;transgressed&quot; beyond any conflicts. Hence the common &quot;lizard brain&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excuse for having modern feelings.
</EM><BR>
<P>An enlightened person is happy to acknowledge both the paradoxes of
<BR>
conflicting emotions and the confusion they sometimes bring.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is not a battle between two &quot;realms&quot; it is a natural, circuitous, shifting 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and weighing between two important parts of cognition that are both important 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the minds healthy functioning.
</EM><BR>
<P>No argument.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Our so called lizard brain usually only kicks in when we are faced with a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; huge shock or fear reaction.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would have to disagree.  I would put &quot;attraction&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, &quot;lust&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;awe&quot;, &quot;sadness&quot;, &quot;empathy&quot; and a variety of other emotions as being
<BR>
based in pre-rational brain development.  Taking some pages from
<BR>
Moravec's &quot;book&quot;, higher animals have the ability to run simulations
<BR>
in their minds to see if a hunting strategy, or other &quot;behavior&quot; is
<BR>
likely to be successful.  Before that simulation ability developed
<BR>
one had to be driven by instincts.  I consider all emotions as the
<BR>
descendents of those instincts that were required for the survival
<BR>
and propagation of the genes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yet, it's become fashionable to *blame* our ancient mind on emotions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that are tortuous, uncontrollable or otherwise unpleasant. We *thank*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our intellect for emotions such as tranquility, satisfaction, contentment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and joy. We try to not let emotion guide us, because we do not trust it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power over us.
</EM><BR>
<P>About 7 years ago, I cared very deeply for a woman.  That trust was
<BR>
betrayed in a fairly heinous fashion.  For several subsequent years
<BR>
I considered women as a class as fundamentally untrustable and I have
<BR>
probably not restored my once unboundless optimism in people even today.
<BR>
If you carefully review my posts over the last year, you will see that
<BR>
I place the &quot;trustability&quot; of humans as a fundamental problem that may
<BR>
make them &quot;undeserving&quot; of salvation.
<BR>
<P>I was entirely intellectually aware of that process and knew what I was
<BR>
feeling and why I was feeling it.  Could that alter those feelings?  No.
<BR>
Rewiring the biochemistry and neural pathways of the brain is not something
<BR>
that can be accomplished &quot;by desire&quot;.  In some individuals, approaches
<BR>
such as therapy, drugs, etc. may allow a renormalization.  For others, such
<BR>
as myself, time may be the best medicine.
<BR>
<P>It has nothing to do with what is &quot;fashionable&quot; and has everything to
<BR>
do with whether it is &quot;real&quot; and whether or not you are &quot;happy&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;well-adjusted&quot;, and &quot;functional&quot; in society.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They are not two unrelated functions. Your perception stream or &quot;thought 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stream&quot; is inevitably linked by emotion when you are in most normal states
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of thought. The fact that emotions produce very healthy and creative 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; associations in both artists and scientists is well documented.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I have no doubt about this.  I enjoy greatly the &quot;elation&quot; I get when
<BR>
I get an particularly exciting insight or solve a difficult problem.
<BR>
There have been times I've wandered from one end of my house to the
<BR>
other muttering, &quot;That is cool, that is so cool&quot;...  I am happy to
<BR>
cherish those moments.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When one is tuned finely to one's emotions, and perceives them as a natural, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; healthy motivator and helmsman, it shows maturity and wisdom. Wisdom is a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; part of intelligence. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Granted.  However, one can be wise, or enlightened, and that can do
<BR>
absolutely nothing for the dark clouds that emotions can bring to bear
<BR>
on your psyche, unrequested and undesired by the occupant.  Given, for
<BR>
example, the dysfunctionality that depression creates in our society,
<BR>
I believe you may want to grant that &quot;emotions&quot; are a very mixed bag.
