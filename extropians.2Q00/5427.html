<P><EM>&gt; I can't claim to have visited many 3rd world countries, but I've spent some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  time in Mexico. I've noticed 2 major causes of poverty there.  One is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Catholic church which discourages the use of contraceptives and abortion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The second is the behavior of people who hold positions of power in various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  governmental and corporate entities.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've spent quite a bit of time in Mexico, both on business and for fun.  In a 
<BR>
general sense, Bonnie, you're very right about what's wrong there.  As for 
<BR>
Catholicism, the irony with Mexico is that it is one of the most secular 
<BR>
countries in Latin America, the various waves of revolution that have swept 
<BR>
over the country having been largely inspired by the ideals of the 18th 
<BR>
century Enlightenment.  &quot;The Revolution&quot; as it is thought of by most Mexicans 
<BR>
had a distinctly anti-clerical cast to its ideology (such as it was - the 
<BR>
truth is that the various stages of the revolution were primarily ad hoc 
<BR>
coups).  In fact, one of the few reservations voiced by Mexican intellectuals 
<BR>
about the &quot;conservative&quot; candidate most likely to unseat the PRI in the next 
<BR>
presidential election is the fear that he may abandon the explicitly secular 
<BR>
ideology of the ruling party.
<BR>
<P>The reality about religion in Mexico is that the PRI and the Church have 
<BR>
declared a realpolitik truce, each respecting fairly complete domination in 
<BR>
the other's sphere.  The Church turns a blind eye to the deep-seated 
<BR>
corruption of the PRI and its explicit patronal vote-buying at the local 
<BR>
level, and the PRI allows the Church a free hand in indoctrinating each 
<BR>
generation of Mexicans in a fundamentally conservative and pessimistic 
<BR>
world-view that suits the PRI just fine.
<BR>
<P>The second factor you mention is the cement that locks in this monolithic 
<BR>
ideological and political structure.  Although the professed culture of 
<BR>
Mexico is premised on the Enlightenment ideal of the rule of law, the truth 
<BR>
is that law in Mexico is a shallow veneer that merely casts a mantle of 
<BR>
legitimacy onto what amounts to a feudal system of family-dominated 
<BR>
commercial and political fiefdoms.  The big industrial combines in Mexico are 
<BR>
run by a handful of families who own and control most of the key economic 
<BR>
resources of the country.  They do this under an implicit compact with the 
<BR>
PRI in which one key resource, oil, is ceded to PRI control through PEMEX, 
<BR>
the nationalized oil company.  The industrial combines are run like mafia 
<BR>
familias, with markets being divided up among the dons in secret, unwritten 
<BR>
deals.  Control of and meaningful competition in the economy is thus utterly 
<BR>
closed to outsiders and to real competition.  Just as feudal Japan allowed 
<BR>
foreign traders to do business in tightly circumscribed ports before the 
<BR>
Meiji restoration, the maquiladora factories along the border are a carefully 
<BR>
controlled membrane for this closed economy that allows the family-controlled 
<BR>
industrial combines to deal with the outside world.  Mike Lorrey described 
<BR>
this system in Mexico as mercantilist rather than capitalistic, and he was 
<BR>
exactly right.  Mexico's economic and social system is basically like that of 
<BR>
the big European maritime powers circa 1600.
