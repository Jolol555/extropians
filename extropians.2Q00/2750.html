<P>
Not all Harvey Newstroms are not the guy who wrote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; True.  As I have suggested in a variety of disclaimers, if you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; committed to this goal intrinsically, then there's no convincing you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; However, I'd expected that you DIDN'T hold this goal intrinsically, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only extrinsically, that is, you hold it in light of some other beliefs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that you have, so if those beliefs turned out to be false, you'd drop the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; goal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the problem that this discussion usually degrades into.  You don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really believe that deep down I believe what I say I do.  You are therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not debating with me, but with a strawman viewpoint that you think will make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your point better.  However, when I read your point, it doesn't directly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apply to my discussion, and we end up talking past each other.  (It has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting and thought-provocing anyway!)
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that's oversimplifying my view...  I believed that you had the
<BR>
goal, but I believed that you had different reasons for having the goal
<BR>
than you actually did.
<BR>
<P>I was just about to give up on the point when one last argument occurred
<BR>
to me:
<BR>
<P>The reasons why someone would be interested in this question are
<BR>
simple.  You might be thinking about performing a destructive upload
<BR>
(especially if that's the only option available).  You might be
<BR>
thinking about using backups to make sure &quot;you&quot; don't die.  You might
<BR>
be thinking about the possibility of immortality-for-free in some
<BR>
Tiplerian situation.
<BR>
<P>One reason why someone might be comfortable with all of these is if
<BR>
they believe that they are their own copy set, rather than their
<BR>
consciousness stream or their atoms.  I believe this.  Thus, I reason
<BR>
that destructive uploading is OK, because &quot;I&quot; would survive the
<BR>
upload.  I think that backups would help me to remain immortal,
<BR>
because &quot;I&quot; wouldn't die so long as there was a working backup
<BR>
around.  I think that, if some Tiplerian point does exist or can
<BR>
exist, and I am simulated in it, &quot;I&quot; would then exist for the rest of
<BR>
(subjective) time at the Tiplerian point.
<BR>
<P>If this were the only argument in favor of these positions, and that
<BR>
argument were made to fail, then there would be no argument in favor
<BR>
of destructive uploading, backups, or Tiplerian immortality.
<BR>
<P>However...  According to your own definition of &quot;you,&quot; Harvey, &quot;you&quot;
<BR>
are almost certain to die.  Simple medical immortality is not enough;
<BR>
eventually, if you're not careful, you'll get caught in an accident of
<BR>
sufficient magnitude that &quot;you&quot; will not be able to recover, no matter
<BR>
how advanced the medical science is.  Even if you think that &quot;you&quot;
<BR>
would survive a gradual replacement of your neurons with
<BR>
nanotechnological replacements, you necessarily bear a substantial
<BR>
risk of death so long as you are a finite being that can be blown up.
<BR>
<P>You have already suggested that you would be willing to die for your
<BR>
brother, and you have suggested some reasons why you might be willing
<BR>
to do that.  I argued that these reasons would extend to your copy.
<BR>
<P>So, consider the following situation: Suppose it turns out to be the
<BR>
case that you are doomed: you are going to die within the next five
<BR>
minutes, and you know this.  Your brother's life is also threatened,
<BR>
however; he will also die in the next five minutes UNLESS you
<BR>
sacrifice yourself one minute ahead of time, in which case, he'll be
<BR>
saved.  (Suppose also that your brother cannot make this sacrifice for
<BR>
you.)
<BR>
<P>It seems to me that by almost any standard of morality, you ought to
<BR>
make this sacrifice.  You ought to give up your own life in order to
<BR>
save his, because your death is already imminent.
<BR>
<P>If you bought that argument, then let's try it again with a copy.
<BR>
Suppose you and a copy of you are in the same asymmetric situation I
<BR>
described above.  I'd argue that, for all the same reasons, you should
<BR>
be willing to make this sacrifice for your copy: you should die so
<BR>
that he can live on.
<BR>
<P>You may already see where this argument is going.  YOUR death is
<BR>
imminent in a way that the death of your upload is not.  Your copy can
<BR>
live a substantially longer life than you can if you make that
<BR>
sacrifice.
<BR>
<P>The only change we make for destructive uploading from the earlier
<BR>
case is that your sacrifice brings the copy into existence rather than
<BR>
saves his life; however, in light of the imminence of your own death,
<BR>
I don't take this to be morally relevant.  I take it that there's a
<BR>
substantial chance that you'd make similar sacrifices to save an
<BR>
unborn son of yours.
<BR>
<P>The blunt end of this argument is this: you make it an intrinsic goal
<BR>
of yours to preserve your own consciousness stream.  Fine.  However, I
<BR>
argue that you should also make it a goal of yours to preserve the
<BR>
consciousness streams of your copies, and that, under certain
<BR>
circumstances, (especially the imminence of your own death,) the goal
<BR>
of keeping alive your copy or copies may trump your goal of keeping
<BR>
yourself alive.
<BR>
<P>Of course, there's no question of you making a sacrifice in the case
<BR>
of Tiplerian immortality; that's either going to happen, or it won't.
<BR>
But it does provide a good argument for making and keeping backups,
<BR>
and even allowing yourself to die (under extreme circumstances) in
<BR>
order to make sure a restoration of yourself lives a longer life than
<BR>
you will continue to lead.
<BR>
<P>So, even if you don't think that you can just kill &quot;yourself&quot; and be
<BR>
replaced with a copy, under extreme circumstances, circumstances which
<BR>
you happen to be in right now, you should nonetheless do just that.
