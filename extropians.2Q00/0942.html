<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; But I've come to a different conclusion now.  The truth is that space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; didn't pay and with 20th century technology it never could.  I've yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to see a good economic justification for the kind of truly massive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; public spending required to do anything outside of LEO with that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of technology and, believe me, I WANT to see such a thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Greg, it has &quot;relatively&quot; little to do with the technology and a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do with the volumes.  I think there is a chapter in the Starflight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Handbook that deals with the fact that you have to have a *lot* of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who want to go into space to make it work.  The legacy that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Iridium may leave behind is the fact that is created a volume launch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requirement that may have permanently lowered the cost of getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things into space.  Rockets don't have to be terribly more expensive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than airplanes, they have to fly with airplane frequency however to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribute the development and infrastructure costs over enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seat miles to make such trips affordable.
</EM><BR>
<P>But, as I've said elsewhere, a lot of the R&amp;D stuff has already been done.
<BR>
The infrastructure is not that expensive either.  Some items are one time
<BR>
investments, such as land for launch facilities.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; LEO is a start.  (Actually GEO appears to be where a lot of money is for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; commercial satelites.) I think if the government space programs were
</EM><BR>
shut
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; down and private launch companies used exclusively, we'd see a lot of
</EM><BR>
action
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in LEO leading to action higher up.  My guess would also be that this
</EM><BR>
would
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; build a true infrastructure for space colonization, rather than the
</EM><BR>
rickety
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one NASA has built, abandoned, and rebuilt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have my doubts.  Tourism is the only application I could see that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would demand volumes that would bring ticket prices down $100K-1K range.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; After you have your weather satellites, your multi-spectral imaging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; satellites, your TV satellites and some comm satellites (rapidly being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; displaced by fiber), *what* good is space?  It doesn't have any resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that humans, as currently engineered, really need that can not be obtained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for much less on the ground.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the costs come down, there will be a market.  Heck, scientists want to do
<BR>
experiments up there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now if you want to get creative, go for tele-operated no-holds barred
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robo-wars on the moon.  Get Sony to adapt that little doggie into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robo-space-pit-bull and you would have dozens of teenagers saving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their pennies just to buy one and enter the games.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not a bad idea.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I DISAGREE!  The problem is not reusable vs. non-reusable.  The fact
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people think in those terms only shows how much this locks up the space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mindset.  Reusable rockets, like the Shuttle, have actually increased
</EM><BR>
launch
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; costs, according to David P. Gump in his _Space Enterprise: Beyond
</EM><BR>
NASA_.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It depends how you do the accounting.  Reusable only decreases costs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if the machines are reused as airplanes are, i.e. at high frequency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the complexity or safety requirements prevent rapid turnaround
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; times, then reusable is more expensive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you take the 1975 quoted cost of Apollo ($39 billion) and divide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it by some ~18(?) launches, that works out to something like $2 billion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; per launch.  That is still a lot more than $400 million (in Y2K $)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a shuttle launch costs where you are putting up ~2x as many people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Of course the shuttle can't get you to the moon, so there is some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; balancing that needs to be done.)
</EM><BR>
<P>That's only if you figure in the R&amp;D costs.  We don't need to redo that with
<BR>
Saturn V.  And the Shuttle costs, without R&amp;D, about $250 million per
<BR>
flight.  I bet we could build a throw away Saturn V for one tenth that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Daniel, if you're going to ask Earth to support an extraterrestrial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; economy, I think you have to come up with an economic rationale.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm waiting . . .
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not thinking that way, but I thought I answered this elsewhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I recall, Daniel, those arguments seemed *thin* to me.  For example,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you argue for space power with no comparative analysis of what a similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investment in agricultural and/or electrical or transporation industries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would produce in terms of greater efficiencies that would eliminate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the need for greater power resources.  As I've argued in other letters,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we are a *very* long way from the theoretical efficiency limits of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our current ecology.  [For example, even a few $10's of millions put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into reversible logic designs would result in PC's in 10 years that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumed much less power than those currently becoming ubiquitous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and consuming an ever increasing percentage of electricity produced.]
</EM><BR>
<P>I've argued for other things too.  My main point, though, is that we can
<BR>
access space now for a lot less that it is being done.  By &quot;a lot less&quot; I
<BR>
mean by an order or two of magnitude less.  Does anyone actually think NASA
<BR>
is operating a peak efficiently here?  Or even close?
<BR>
<P>If they do, then why don't we get NASA to design an OS and market it.:)
<BR>
Maybe they can beat Microsoft and all the Linux makers combined.:)
<BR>
