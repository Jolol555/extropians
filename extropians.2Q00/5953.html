<P><EM> &gt; Lee, I'm, quite frankly, exhausted by this discussion. So I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  not going to respond to your points below.
</EM><BR>
<P>Brian:
<BR>
<P>I don't subscribe to the transhumanist list, so I missed much of the
<BR>
discussion that I deduce must have preceded the post that Max made to the
<BR>
extropians list this morning.  I'm sorry you're retiring from the fray here,
<BR>
because I was only just beginning to get a grip on whatever observations
<BR>
about extropianism you had made on the other list.  For now, I'll just make
<BR>
this parting observation regarding some of the discussion you had with Max;
<BR>
that is regarding your use of the term &quot;right wing&quot; to describe
<BR>
&quot;extropianism&quot; or &quot;extropians&quot;, or &quot;most extropians&quot;, or &quot;many extropians&quot; or
<BR>
whatever you meant as the object of that description.
<BR>
<P>I'm not one of those extropians who has only a shallow familiarity with the
<BR>
humanities: I can hardly add two numbers and get the same answer twice, but I
<BR>
spent a lot of time in school, so I must have studied the humanities.  In
<BR>
fact, I've not only studied quite a bit of history and political science, but
<BR>
I've been involved in politics and know many active politicians, and I work
<BR>
in a field that can be fairly called &quot;applied ethics&quot; every day.  With that
<BR>
said, I'll note that I am one of a growing number of people who find the
<BR>
terms &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; to be almost completely drained of meaning.
<BR>
<P>To me, &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; were terms with some significant current content at
<BR>
the beginning of the 20th century.  By the middle of the 20th century, the
<BR>
expereince of totalitarianism had shown people with eyes to see that the
<BR>
reality of politics and ideological conflict in particular societies was far
<BR>
more complex than such simplistic terms could meaningfully capture.
<BR>
Unfortunately, by then popular media, academia and even most working
<BR>
politicians had come to accept that this simplistic unidimensional spectrum
<BR>
was the totality of analysis.  Thus the absurd inconsistency of most modern
<BR>
politics and governance, when analyzed in ideological terms.
<BR>
<P>Thus you'll understand when, with all due respect, I say that use of the
<BR>
terms &quot;right wing&quot; or &quot;left wing&quot; is often a marker to me of people who are
<BR>
mired in what to me is a bankrupt system of political philosophy.  Should we
<BR>
call Pat Buchanan &quot;right wing&quot; when he shares an enthusiasm for protectionist
<BR>
policies with organized labor?  Should we call Ralph Nader &quot;left wing&quot; when
<BR>
he shares technophobia with Ralph Reed?  When Castro's police state supresses
<BR>
dissent in exactly the same way as any United Fruit tin-pot dictator from the
<BR>
1940s or 50s, how can we meaningfully call one &quot;left&quot; and the other &quot;right&quot;?
<BR>
Do we call Castro &quot;left&quot; because he wears the little badge of free
<BR>
healthcare?  If that's a meaningful distinction, then I suppose the best way
<BR>
to classify automobiles is by their color.
<BR>
