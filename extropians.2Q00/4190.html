<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, since I'm such a fan of James H. Austin's _Zen and the Brain_ I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would like to suggest it. It looks at the neuroscience of Zen, a quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; interesting synthesis attempt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have been slowly working my way through this book, and would like to hear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more on what you got out of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>First, it was in my opinion a very readable introduction to Zen and
<BR>
Zen thinking. I don't know if it as understandable as an intro to
<BR>
neuroscience, but my overall impression is that he at least touches on
<BR>
many essentials. I at least had some feeling that I &quot;got&quot; Zen,
<BR>
although that may of course be illusory as I'm not actually *doing* it. 
<BR>
<P>Second, it is a great review of various fun corners of the
<BR>
neuroscience of religion, with a copious amount of references to
<BR>
studies done on mystical experiences, the EEG of meditation and
<BR>
similar stuff. Useful when you want to go into detail or continue on
<BR>
the ideas in the text.
<BR>
<P>Third, he raises very interesting questions both about the
<BR>
neuroscience of enlightenment and what it means to become a
<BR>
self-actualizing, highly optimized being. While I think the later
<BR>
chapters are a bit more wordy (wordyness increases in direct
<BR>
proportion to the distance to one's experience, I guess :-) they have
<BR>
a very interesting hypothesis about enlightenment as a reconditioning
<BR>
of the mind that might fit in very well with my own studies in memory
<BR>
and learning. This is learning on the highest level, the change of the
<BR>
way the whole mind works and its deep values. If we can learn how this
<BR>
occurs, we might find better ways of achieving it than years of
<BR>
meditation.
