<EM>&gt;&gt; -----Original Message-----
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20human%20evolution%20and%20artificial%20birth&In-Reply-To=&lt;3.0.6.32.20000701012247.007cd990@pop.indigo.ie&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I wouldn't at first. While I agree that in vitro wombs make excellent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; sense (once the technology is developed far enough) *rationally*,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; childbearing is an intensely emotional, (dare I say it?) spiritual and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; socioculturally enmeshed affair that radical changes of it will at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; best take time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As someone who has given birth, I'd go for the artificial womb in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;heartbeat (and I'd reccommend it to my daughter as well, if she wanted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have babies), if I could be sure that the child weren't missing out on any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;important aspects of development.  Thinking of the research done on baby
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;humans and non-human primates who were deprived of nuturing bodily contact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;during the early parts of their lives, I predict that the period in the womb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will turn out to be significant for the child.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Breastfeeding is another thing entirely. I wouldn't want to give it up. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;found it to be a delightful, sensual experience and, from what I hear from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mothers who use bottles, far easier to deal with than artificial feeding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;methods.  And apparently it's emotionally good for the babies as well. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;breastfeeding does not require giving birth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; cultures, female children are not valued as much as men
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; children.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Well now, those cultures may just be...No!  I'm absolutely NOT going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;start this particular conversation!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Good bye all,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bonnie

<EM>&gt;------------------------------
</EM><BR>
<P>Once I'd explained the concept of the artificial womb (AW) to my wife, she
<BR>
thought it was an excellent idea;  Would be safer, allow women more freedom
<BR>
during &quot;gestation&quot; time etc...  Then again, my wife isn't too fond of the
<BR>
idea of giving birth, so maybe she's biased!  Still, women know very well
<BR>
the meaning of the motto &quot;Work smarter, not harder&quot;.  I think many would go
<BR>
for it, except perhaps for Religious Fundamentalists.
<BR>
<P>The strange thing is I don't believe the whole AW idea has been seriously
<BR>
considered by 99% of women.  Then again, many people don't seem to realize
<BR>
the Genome Project has been doing its work for 10 years!
<BR>
<P>I guess that if women were to find that it removed only the hassle and not
<BR>
the joy and closeness of childbirth, then they'd happily accept it.  I
<BR>
think it'll be a matter of &quot;a woman's right to choose&quot;.  Some things never
<BR>
change, eh?:)
<BR>
<P>And while were discussing women, I've a hypothesis that says perhaps women
<BR>
would be a better focus in the attempt to spread the Life
<BR>
Extension/Immortality meme.  Wonder how most ladies would respond to the
<BR>
choice of aging gracefully or not aging at all.  Perhaps it would negate
<BR>
the pressure to conform to some physical/emotional ideal.  It would
<BR>
certainly prove a healthier role model than many of the distorted images of
<BR>
the female form women seem to be constantly subjected to, esp. in the
<BR>
fashion industry.  Think about it;  An independent woman who knows what she
<BR>
wants, with millenia to achieve greatness of any kind she desires.  They
<BR>
would have all the time they needed to do every one of the things their
<BR>
mothers never got to do.
<BR>
<P>Or maybe I'm talking out the top of my skull.....
