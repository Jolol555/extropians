Matt are you old enough to have seen the pilot for Star Trek? Something like 
<BR>
this happened. It was way cool. The techno-gods causes a guy to halucinate 
<BR>
so that a really messed up accident woman was babe-ized. What we wouldn't 
<BR>
give for that tech today. spike
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Having that sort of &quot;telepathic&quot; tech would be quite incredible, but 
<BR>
frankly, even as a young boy watching that episode I was repelled!!  I 
<BR>
wanted that couple to be REALLY healed of their horrible crippling injuries 
<BR>
and be the beautiful and healthy people they only appeared to be.  Poor 
<BR>
Captain Pike!  Green light, red light for answering questions!  The couple 
<BR>
should have been cryonically suspended till federation tech could heal them. 
<BR>
And with 23rd century cryonics that should not be any problem!!
<BR>
<P>I want a world of where every women is a &quot;babe(among other qualities)&quot; and 
<BR>
every man a &quot;hunk.&quot;  Then we can simply compete over wealth, intelligence, 
<BR>
character and personality!  Human beauty is such an intoxicating drug that 
<BR>
so many hunger to have and to share with others, there needs to be enough to 
<BR>
go around for all.
<BR>
<P>I propose the &quot;End World Beauty Hunger&quot; project, whose grand goal is to make 
<BR>
every child, teen and adult on the planet very goodlooking.  At this point 
<BR>
in human societal development this may seem rediculous, but before the next 
<BR>
century is out it will not be.  When hunger, disease and poverty are wiped 
<BR>
away, this problem will be seen as one of the next steps up for humanity.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
