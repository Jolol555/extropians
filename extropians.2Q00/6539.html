<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; which kinda end up with a notion Gould would like: contingency,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or blind luck, based on location and fortunate interspecies synergy.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
What other sorts of reasons would you expect?  Some group randomly had genes
<BR>
for better intelligence than others?  Some group randomly had a more
<BR>
technophilic and inventive culture?  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; puzzler was sore.  Why, for instance, did the process of evolution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do so little with big brains?  We have only a few really large brained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; species: cetacians, elephants, humans.  Why?  And why did evolution
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, there _were_ a lot of other hominid species...  Big brain equals
<BR>
generalists, equals competitors for one niche, equals eventual monopoly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; wait until so late in the process to produce large brained species?
</EM><BR>
<P>Brains have costs.  20% of human food goes to fueling our brains.  And our
<BR>
females have a high chance of dying in giving birth.  To a single child, who
<BR>
takes _forever_ to raise.  And if our brain is a conglomeration of different
<BR>
modules, rather than a bigass general-purpose monolithic neural network, it
<BR>
would take time to develop and accrete and integrate the modules.
<BR>
<P>Of course, when I think of elephants, the size of their _brain_ isn't the
<BR>
first thing I think of... I assume you mean elephants and whales have high
<BR>
brain-body ratios; their having large brains is in of itself uninteresting, as
<BR>
they have large bodies to control.  But then the next question to ask is what
<BR>
are those species doing with the extra brain matter?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And why did humans have large brains for nearly 100k yrs before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inventing civilization?  And why did it take large brained humans
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, more than a 100k, I thought.  But some people think speech was invented
<BR>
only 40K ago.  Not that we have any clue.  But... perhaps because civilization
<BR>
was a bad idea?  The fossil evidence shows that farmers work harder and are
<BR>
less healthy than hunter-gatherers.  I imagine farming was developed partly by
<BR>
accident, perhaps under fortunate circumstances, and then gave rise to a large
<BR>
population which could only be supported by farming (or pastoralism.)  Then,
<BR>
of course, the farmers and pastoralists can brush hunter-gatherers aside like
<BR>
fog with their superior numbers.  (And superior submission to military
<BR>
organization, perhaps.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; so long to get written language?  This leads to the obvious question,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how in the hell does technological stagnation occur?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
You betray your assumptions.  One might ask how does technological progress
<BR>
occur?
<BR>
<P>Future AIs might ask how it took so long for all 'humans' to learn math.  Why
<BR>
don't all Americans know calculus?
