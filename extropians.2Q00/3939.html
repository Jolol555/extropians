I've found it helpful to keep an open mind about what I think of as reality,
<BR>
because it keeps me from taking obstacles too seriously.  As I said in
<BR>
another post, this has more to do with psychology than with any branch of
<BR>
physics.  And yet, since mathematical models are products of the human mind,
<BR>
they do seem to be proper subjects of psychological studies.
<BR>
<P>I've just finished reading some articles by N.I. Vavlilov, along with a
<BR>
biography.  Vavilov died of starvation in a Soviet prison in 1943 because he
<BR>
refused to accept the &quot;mainstream&quot; genetic science of that time and place,
<BR>
which was Lamarkian (basically, Larmark's theory was that evolution occurs
<BR>
as a result of abilities or characteristics acquired by parents and passed
<BR>
to their offspring, the usual example being the giraffe who reaches its neck
<BR>
up to eat leaves from trees and then gives birth to a baby with a long neck.
<BR>
Another part of the theory as it pertained to botany was that you could, for
<BR>
example, grow winter wheat in the summer, and the offspring of this wheat
<BR>
would be spring wheat.) As far as I can tell, many of the scientists
<BR>
educated in Soviet universities of the times took Larmakian genetics quite
<BR>
seriously, and their observations and experiments supported their beliefs.
<BR>
Surely, some of these men and women suppressed what they truly believed in
<BR>
order to stay alive.  But my impression is that many, if not most, of them
<BR>
truly believed, and the results they saw when they performed scientific
<BR>
experiments conformed to their beliefs.
<BR>
<P>To a great extent, people see only what they believe is possible.  When a
<BR>
person begins to extend his or her concept of what's possible, life
<BR>
definitely changes. I can say this from personal experience as well as from
<BR>
what I've heard and read from other people.

Subject: Re: The Matrix
<BR>
<P><P><P>The thing to remember when you get into this kind of metaphysical
<BR>
speculations is to ask yourself: does this really matter? Does this
<BR>
have any relevance beside the intellectual pleasure of imagining
<BR>
complex or bizarre ontologies? If models with many &quot;levels of reality&quot;
<BR>
do not have any impact on how we live our lives, our ethics or our
<BR>
physics then they are rather irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>In the Matrix, there was a very real effect on life once you
<BR>
discovered it. Is there any evidence whatsoever for something similar
<BR>
in the real world? A certain amount of fuzziness (be it memory of
<BR>
Heisenberg) is not enough.
