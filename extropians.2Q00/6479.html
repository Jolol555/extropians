Well, Joao,
<BR>
<P>Given your definition of senescence you might not have a stronger case for
<BR>
isolating the &quot;causes&quot; of ageing.
<BR>
<P>These processes are strongly coupled in multiple feedback loops
<BR>
<P>The fact that you alter ONE gene and it makes a massive difference does NOT
<BR>
say that it's THE master gene. Case in point: if you lower serum cholesterol
<BR>
substantially (say down to under 110mg/dL... coronary artery disease ceases
<BR>
to become a statistically important killer in the population at large.
<BR>
<P>Does that mean that high cholesterol is THE mechanistic &quot;cause&quot; of such
<BR>
heart disease?... far from it.
<BR>
<P>Certainly, by altering genes related to insulinlike resistance or genes for
<BR>
SOD and catalase you can extend the lifespans of mice, fruitflies and even
<BR>
worms...and by supplementing with things like CoQ10 you can increase average
<BR>
lifespans of mice... but the processes are so wickedly coupled that the only
<BR>
biological way you'll get to that 1,000 year birthday is by modifying the
<BR>
action of dozens or scores or thousands of genes.
<BR>
<P>As you extend the lifespan horizon you're going to collide with even more
<BR>
forbidding barriers to eternal youth... barriers that are not directly
<BR>
placed by simple darwinian restrictions on optimum individual reproductive
<BR>
lifespan, but that arise from the fact that we metazoans are all clonal
<BR>
colonies. You'll have to keep redesigning  the entire genome as you push the
<BR>
threshold back...
<BR>
<P>Already, there is some evidence that ageing in the &quot;young old&quot; is of a
<BR>
different nature than ageing in the oldest old. The oldest old are a genetic
<BR>
elite who have withstood the killing processes that plague us early on.
<BR>
<P>But they die nevertheless...and the mechanism of their ageing seems
<BR>
different. Overtly cellular processes as opposed to system processes seem to
<BR>
kick in. So we may end up peeling an onion in the quest for biological
<BR>
immortality.
<BR>
<P>As to your chaos theory thing, &quot;Chaos theory says that simple phenomenon has
<BR>
simple
<BR>
origins&quot;... I don't know. The most interesting thing about complexity theory
<BR>
is that complex systems display emergent behaviour on a massive scale.
<BR>
<P>It's precisely for this reason that it's hard to isolate simple causes. Our
<BR>
naive notions of causality break down when the system displays strong
<BR>
coupling and largescale emergent behaviour.
<BR>

Subject: Re : Cornering the causes of aging (was Re: AGING: Accumulation of
<BR>
DNAdamage)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Hi!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;JOAO PEDRO SAID: &quot;...One of the major failures of gerontology has been in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;cornering where are the causes of aging located....&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;CYMM SAYS: That's not strictly true, Joao. If it's one thing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;gerontology has taught us is that ageing - and the diseases of ageing -
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;MULTIFACTORIAL in aetiology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;If you're looking for one major &quot;cause&quot; and one major &quot;cure&quot; for &quot;ageing&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;you'll never find it. The &quot;failure&quot; lies in the interrelating of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;multiple factors to produce a very useful medical model.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You're saying that aging is the sum of all genes affecting age-related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;diseases? I don't agree. I think many age-related diseases evolved pararell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to aging but are not senescence. (I define senescence as the basic and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intrinsic aging process, independant of all diseases.) And this process can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well be a very simple mechanism. Just look at some progeroid syndromes and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how simple they are originated; or look at the large diversity in lifespan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and aging phenotypes in many phylum (including mammals), if aging had that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;many genes affecting it, these differences would not exist. There are more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;genes affecting age-related diseases than are genes differentiating us from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chimpazees!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As for experimental evidence, I can cite you the recent lifespan extension
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of almost 40% in mice by changing a single gene (in which senescence was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clearly slowed down). Chaos theory says that simple phenomenon has simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;origins; senescence is a very simple phenomenon (an exponential increase in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mortality from age 19 until age 70), so it can well have a very simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mechanism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Best wishes.
</EM><BR>
