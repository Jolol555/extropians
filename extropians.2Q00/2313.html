</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True. But I didn't say anything about accepting a police state. I said that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the idea that only human observations can constitute evidence is rapidly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becoming impractical, and will be completely unworkable in the very near
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future. If you don't like my solution to the problem, offer another one -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but don't tell me we can just bury our heads in the sand and ignore it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Simple: require a minimum of a chimp level AI running the cameras.
<BR>
Principle should not bend to practicality, the only reason cameras are
<BR>
goin up now rather than 20 years ago is that cameras are relatively
<BR>
cheap now relative to the value of a traffic citation. Demanding a
<BR>
higher standard of practicality to match one's legal principles merely
<BR>
puts it off for a few more years, but in the end you won't have people
<BR>
so upset about being having themeselves, rather than their vehicles,
<BR>
being cited for something they did, and eliminate all vicitimless crimes
<BR>
from being prosecutable with camera evidence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nothing should ever be assigned a 100% level of trust in a court of law. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that doesn't mean the level of trust has to be 0%. The idea is supposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be to present the jury with all available data and let them decide who to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe, remember?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Besides, the original topic was what to do with systems that are far more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult to tamper with. It is impossible to make any device completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tamper-proof, but it is pretty easy to make them robust enough that it takes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real expertise to falsify their data. If the device also has reasonably high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accuracy (say, &lt;0.01% false positives), it is going to be much more common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a human witness to lie than for the device to give false data.
</EM><BR>
<P>The thing is though that the device's data does not go straight to the
<BR>
courtroom. It gets transmitted somewhere, stored, analysed, stored
<BR>
again, and then ticketing reports are processed based on the sorting
<BR>
analysis. Every time data is stored it is ripe for manipulation or
<BR>
corruption.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have to admit, BTW, that I find it both amusing and sad that we can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having this argument in this particular forum. Can you picture applying a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'only direct observations by sentients can be evidence' rule to a society of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jupiter brains? Even relatively puny technologies like mature VR and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; animal-level AI make the idea unworkable. Either you eventually adopt a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flexible standard, or you end up with large swaths of social interaction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that are ripe for criminal abuse, but completely beyond the reach of law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcement.
</EM><BR>
<P>There have been rare occasions where the reactions of dogs have been
<BR>
admissible in courts, and the testimony of young children. Give me a
<BR>
chimpanzee level AI doing the traffic work and I might change my mind.
<BR>
Until then, don't demand that I regard a machine produced traffic
<BR>
citation as anything other than automated tyranny.
