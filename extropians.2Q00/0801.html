<P><EM>&gt; A few years ago I remarked to Ralph Merkle &quot;You keep saying that no one

<EM>&gt; will ever really build a computer out of nano rod logic, but I suspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that at some point in the future a museum staff will do so to see if it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have worked.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I would tend to agree with Ralph, in that I think we will have things
<BR>
like single electron transistors before we can build nano-rod-logic
<BR>
diamondoid computers.  However, titanium carbide or even better a
<BR>
hafnium carbide rod-logic-computer would really crank.  Why?
<BR>
Highest melting points.  Means you can put the CPU elements much
<BR>
closer together due to decreased cooling channel requirements,
<BR>
thus reducing the propagation delays resulting in greater throughput.
<BR>
Interestingly enough, your coolants of choice would probably be
<BR>
liquid beryllium if you wanted the lowest mass (lower pumping costs)
<BR>
or liquid tungsten if you wanted the highest operating temperature.
<BR>
<P>Simulations would need to be done however to make sure the &quot;rods&quot;
<BR>
still slide properly and don't become too soft or sticky.  Since
<BR>
you probably have to design in allowances for thermal expansion,
<BR>
this might be a computer that only functioned accurately after you
<BR>
warmed it up to the toasty temperature of 3000-4000 deg K.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly enough, there would clearly be uses for such computers
<BR>
in space probes designed to descend through stellar atmospheres.
