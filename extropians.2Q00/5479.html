Michael S. Lorrey  says:

<P>&quot;Sure, but how much did you pay for the different trucks? Are your
<BR>
maintenance savings more than your increased finance payments, interest,
<BR>
etc.? Do you need more insurance, or higher premiums?&quot;
<BR>
<P>yup...
<BR>
<P>Hmmmm...rough figures....
<BR>
<P>The first truck cost 40K...insurance was about 250 or so a month...maint was
<BR>
1k monthly......payments were 1200....a month...
<BR>
<P>The second truck....less the trade in was 54K....insurance was up to about
<BR>
350 or so....maint was 1k or so....payments were 1500...
<BR>
<P>This truck....less trade was about 80K....insurance is 450 or so...maint is
<BR>
zero (well....200 every 15 thousand miles for an oil change and
<BR>
lube)....payments are about 2k..
<BR>
<P>HOWSOMEVER.....not only was maint in the first two trux about 1K a
<BR>
month....the down time (lost income) while they were being fixed....was
<BR>
comparable.....zero now (approximately)
<BR>
<P>Plus...this truck is stronger, safer and more comfortable....(with more
<BR>
gimmicks)....
<BR>
<P>Had I shop facilities the situation would be different....Unfortunately all
<BR>
maint is done &quot;on the fly&quot;...at dealerships or truckstops...at $70
<BR>
+(sometimes way plus)  per shop hour that gets pricey.....
<BR>
<P>HOWSOMEVER......my new truck is MUCH sexier....
