<EM>&gt;      &gt; This sounds too much like a physics teacher arguing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;heavier-than- air flight is impossible as the Wright Flier passes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overhead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The difference is that heavier than air flight does not become more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as time progresses but an effective anti-Missile system does. Your opponent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not going to sit on his hands while you build your system and he wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do much to make your life very difficult indeed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Example: There  has been a lot of talk about optical LASERS fired from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; airplanes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but if I just buy some paint at Home Depot and paint my warhead white you'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increase the power of your LASER about a hundred times. If I went a little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more high tech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and used a non-conductive reflective coating tuned to the frequency of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; LASER
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you'd have to increase the power many thousands of times.
</EM><BR>
<P>This really isn't so. Based on the pulsed power work I've seen, mirrored
<BR>
surfaces do little to protect, because they heat up so rapidly. A missile will
<BR>
not only have to be mirrored, but it will have to be spinning and have a very
<BR>
good heat conducting surface, or it will have to have a thick ablative coating
<BR>
over its entire surface, quite a bit of weight.. A warhead re-entering is quite
<BR>
hot and non-reflective, though its ablative coating does give it some
<BR>
protections.
<BR>
<P>A laser essentially drills through atmosphere, and when it hits a solid object,
<BR>
the top layers of material absorb so much energy so quickly that its thermal
<BR>
conductivity, i.e. its ability to conduct thermal current, is slower than the
<BR>
amount of of heat being put into that material. Much as kinetic kill objects
<BR>
work so well because they travel faster than the speed of sound within the
<BR>
material, when heat is applied to a location faster than the material can pipe
<BR>
it away, you generate a thermal shock wave within the material, and the material
<BR>
generally explodes as a result. This is my basic understanding of why high
<BR>
powered lasers are so effective.
