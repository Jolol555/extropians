<EM>&gt; &gt; Note that this was a comparison of a generation #1 product with a

<EM>&gt; As a brief point (maybe I'm jumping ahead of Michael here), it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably not quite correct to say Corel's is generation #1, being built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on a good deal of Linux development in general, and specifically being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; derived from Debian.
</EM><BR>
<P>Iffy point. Corel took Debian 'Slink' and turned it into their own distro.
<BR>
Along the way, they wrote their own installer -- the standard Debian one
<BR>
is (cough, cough) not exactly user friendliness personified -- and then
<BR>
bolted KDE on top of it. They filed a lot of rough edges off of KDE (I
<BR>
suspect their usability testing experience came in very handy) and bolted
<BR>
some extras into the distro. IIRC, Slink is Libc 5.0 based, and I vaguely
<BR>
recall Corel using a 2.0 series kernel (though I may be wrong on that; I'm
<BR>
working from memory). 
<BR>
<P>What I think is worth noting is that the quality of their installer
<BR>
improved noticeably between successive non-public betas and the final
<BR>
release; the early betas couldn't even cope with a PS/2 mouse!  That's why
<BR>
I characterise it as a release 1.0 product; the kernel and command line
<BR>
stuff certainly isn't, but what everyone's judging Corel by is the quality
<BR>
of their installer and desktop integration, and _that_ is definitely still
<BR>
a bit fresh. Although their 1.0 beats SuSE's 6.0 into a cocked hat, IMO ...
