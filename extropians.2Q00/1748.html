<P>Report: Cloning Produces Unnaturally Young Cattle
<BR>
<P>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Correspondent
<BR>
<P>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists who cloned six cows said on Thursday
<BR>
the animals show
<BR>
signs of being even younger than their chronological ages, and said this
<BR>
could mean cloning
<BR>
technology offers a true fountain of youth.
<BR>
<P>The cloning process seemed to have literally turned back the aging clock
<BR>
in the cells of the six
<BR>
heifers.
<BR>
<P>The researchers said it might be possible to use cloning to create
<BR>
organs that are nearly immortal
<BR>
for use in transplants, or tissue lines to treat diseases of aging such
<BR>
as Alzheimer's, arthritis and
<BR>
heart disease.
<BR>
<P>``Not only were we able to clone calves ... but these animals appear to
<BR>
have cells younger than
<BR>
their chronological age,'' Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell Technology,
<BR>
Inc., who led the study,
<BR>
said in a telephone interview.
<BR>
<P>Clock Gets Reset
<BR>
<P>``What we showed in this paper is this clock gets reset. It gets wound
<BR>
back up,'' said Dr. Michael
<BR>
West, president and chief executive officer of the Worcester,
<BR>
Massachusetts-based company. ``It
<BR>
remains to be determined whether this would extend the life of the
<BR>
animal.''
<BR>
<P>The findings, published in the journal Science, are surprising because
<BR>
the most famous cloned
<BR>
animal, Dolly the sheep, appears to be older than her chronological age.
<BR>
<P>Dolly, whose birth was announced in 1997, was the first mammal to be
<BR>
cloned using an adult
<BR>
cell. Her makers at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, whose technology
<BR>
now belongs to Geron
<BR>
Bio-Med, found signs that her cells, when she was born, were the same
<BR>
age as the cells of the
<BR>
6-year-old ewe from which she was cloned.
<BR>
<P>They calculate this by looking at the telomeres, which are little caps
<BR>
on the ends of the
<BR>
chromosomes that carry the genetic blueprint inside cells. Each time a
<BR>
cell divides, the telomeres
<BR>
become a little worn.
<BR>
<P>When they are frayed beyond repair, the cell dies. This stage is known
<BR>
as senescence.
<BR>
<P>Dolly had old telomeres. But the six heifers, cloned from cells taken
<BR>
from a 45-day-old fetus,
<BR>
have exceptionally young telomeres.
<BR>
<P>What is even more surprising is that the cells that Lanza's team cloned
<BR>
were not fresh and new.
<BR>
They had been grown and allowed to divide over and over again in the
<BR>
laboratory until they were
<BR>
senescent. The team, which included researchers at the Lakenau Institute
<BR>
in Wynnewood, Pa., and
<BR>
Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, fused the cells into cow
<BR>
eggs using a slightly
<BR>
different cloning process than that used to make Dolly.
<BR>
<P>``The egg cells acts like a little time machine and can take it back, as
<BR>
far as we can tell, to the
<BR>
beginning of life,'' West said.
<BR>
<P>``Totally Cool''
<BR>
<P>``It's kind of abracadabra and through processes we don't understand,
<BR>
they get reverted. It's totally
<BR>
cool.''
<BR>
<P>The medical implications are profound, West said.
<BR>
<P>``It's the first day in a new era in treating age-related disease,''
<BR>
West said.
<BR>
<P>``We could take one young cell from a patient and make hundreds or
<BR>
thousands of young cells and
<BR>
put them back in the patient and give them back a young immune system or
<BR>
give them back young
<BR>
cartilage in their knees,'' he added.
<BR>
<P>``If you had a damaged heart, we could take a few cells from you and
<BR>
grow up new heart cells
<BR>
and these would be your own cells so you wouldn't reject them,'' added
<BR>
Lanza.
<BR>
<P>Of course, this would involve technically cloning the patient --
<BR>
something called therapeutic
<BR>
cloning -- and there would be opposition to allowing it.
<BR>
<P>But Lanza said the cells created would never be slated for development
<BR>
as a human embryo.
<BR>
``Once people understand the science here, the more they hear about it,
<BR>
the more likely they are
<BR>
going to say this is a good thing,'' he said.
<BR>
<P>His team is continuing to work with cloned cells. In 1998 they created
<BR>
clones using human cell
<BR>
nuclei and cow cells, which did not develop into embryos but into a
<BR>
dishful of cells.
<BR>
<P>Lanza said his team does not quite understand how the heifers became
<BR>
``younger''. But he said
<BR>
genes whose activity usually dies down as a cell ages were especially
<BR>
active.
<BR>
<P>``These results suggest the animals are younger than their biological
<BR>
age,'' Lanza said.
<BR>
<P>``When other cows the same age start to grow old and frail, their cells
<BR>
should be able to divide
<BR>
the same as a newborn calf's. They should be able to repair damage due
<BR>
to disease and aging and
<BR>
should live longer, healthier lives.
<BR>
<P>Only time will tell. Cows allowed to lead natural lives live to be 24
<BR>
and older.
