&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The standard rodent chow used by gerontologists does not have 
<BR>
&nbsp;whole natural foods in it like berries or seeds. Instead cooked 
<BR>
&nbsp;cornstarch is used, which has an unusually high glycemic index. 
<BR>
&nbsp;The use of this high GI carbohydrate is partly responsible for 
<BR>
&nbsp;the high rates of glucose tolerance which occur in lab animals 
<BR>
&nbsp;that are cared for by gerontologists.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important factor is to be the relative lack of insulin 
<BR>
&nbsp;sensitising substances, which are readily available in natural 
<BR>
&nbsp;diets, but which are largely stripped out of the &quot;purified&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;diets used by uninformed gerontologists. These scientists as a 
<BR>
&nbsp;group well illustrate the dangers of over-specialization, any 
<BR>
&nbsp;scientist involved in diabetes research would tell gerontologists 
<BR>
&nbsp;that a phytochemical stripped high glycemic index diet is a 
<BR>
&nbsp;recipe for adult onset diabetes, and lowering caloric intake of 
<BR>
&nbsp;such a poor diet can lower risk, via a reduction in glycemic load.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so called called anti-aging calorically restricted diet 
<BR>
&nbsp;appears to be merely an artifact of using a poor diet that 
<BR>
&nbsp;induces glucose intolerance when fed ad-libitum.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One rat strain that was fed insulin sensitising chromium 
<BR>
&nbsp;picolinate had their average lifespan restored to what appears 
<BR>
&nbsp;to be &quot;normal&quot; values. This is well in excess of that yielded by 
<BR>
&nbsp;caloric restriction of a purified diet. Chromium picolinate 
<BR>
&nbsp;has no effect on healthy non-diabetic humans.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caloric intake as measured by height has no effect on 
<BR>
&nbsp;longevity in humans, and weight loss diets do not reduce 
<BR>
&nbsp;mortality rates in this species. Obesity also has no effect 
<BR>
&nbsp;on mortality, provided physically fit obese humans are 
<BR>
&nbsp;compared with physically fit lean humans. In physically unfit 
<BR>
&nbsp;humans, lean people have a higher mortality than obese.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These basic facts have been available for quite some time, 
<BR>
&nbsp;but have been largely ignored by over-specialized gerontologists. 
<BR>
&nbsp;It is unfortunate, but the primary roadblock to continuing advances 
<BR>
&nbsp;in gerontology appear to be the incompetence of the gerontologists
<BR>
&nbsp;themselves.)

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Longitudinal determination of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;skin collagen glycation and glycoxidation rates predicts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;early death in C57BL/6NNIA mice.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, the National Institute on Aging launched a 10-year program aimed at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;identification of biomarkers of aging. Previous results from our laboratory
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;showed that pentosidine, an advanced glycation product, formed in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;skin collagen at a rate inversely related to maximum life
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;span across several mammalian species. As part of the Biomarkers Program, we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;investigated the hypothesis that longitudinal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;determination of glycation and glycoxidation rates in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;skin collagen could predict longevities in ad libitum-fed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(AL) and caloric restricted (CR) mice. C57BL/6NNia male mice were biopsied at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;age 20 months and at natural death. Glycation (furosine method) was assessed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and the glycoxidation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;products carboxymethyllysine (CML) and pentosidine were determined by GC/MS
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and HPLC, respectively. CR vs. AL significantly (P&lt;0.0001) increased both
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mean (34 vs. 27 months) and maximum (47 vs. 31 months) life spans.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Skin collagen levels of furosine (pmol/&amp;mgr;mol lysine) were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;approximately 2.5-fold greater than CML levels and 100-fold greater than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pentosidine. Individual accumulation rates modeled as linear equations were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significantly (P&lt;0.001) inhibited by CR vs. AL for all parameters and in all
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cases varied inversely with longevity (P&lt;0.1 to &lt;0.0001). The incidence of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;three tissue pathologies (lymphoma, dermatitis, and seminal vesiculitis) was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;found to be attenuated by CR and the latter pathology correlated
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significantly with longevities (r=0.54, P=0. 002). The finding that markers
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of skin collagen glycation and glycoxidation rates can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;predict early deaths in AL and CR C57BL/6NNia mice strongly suggests that an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;age-related deterioration in glucose tolerance is a life span-determining
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;process.
