Didn't Vernor Vinge posit the question of identity with his Singularity 
<BR>
analogy; &quot;Does the sperm still exist after it unites with the egg?&quot; Very 
<BR>
Zen-sounding.  If the technology works as well as we all hope, to the 
<BR>
capacity we all hope, then keeping a 
<BR>
&quot;veriform appendix&quot; of self , or being that veriform appendix of self is a 
<BR>
great idea. When a person goes through an intense event, such as war, are 
<BR>
they same person? Yes and no is the correct answer. People can change over 
<BR>
time (personality-wise) so it seems to be a healthy objective to check one's 
<BR>
goals and see if we are still moving where we originally felt we needed o be.

<P>&lt;&lt; I wonder if it would be wise to make an effort to preserve our former
<BR>
&nbsp;personalities, rather than just allowing ourselves to change naturally.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;One of the philosophical objections sometimes raised here against
<BR>
&nbsp;immortality is that you would change so much over a long lifespan as to
<BR>
&nbsp;have little relation to the being you were originally.  In that case,
<BR>
&nbsp;the original person is really gone, just as surely as if he had died.
<BR>
&nbsp;All that is left is someone who was influenced, perhaps only marginally,
<BR>
&nbsp;by the person who began the process.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;A way to address this would be to make a commitment to honor the beliefs
<BR>
&nbsp;and desires of your older selves, to think of yourself as not just the
<BR>
&nbsp;person you are today, but also as a representative of the hopes and
<BR>
&nbsp;plans of the people you were in the past.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;This wouldn't mean that you could never change, only that as you
<BR>
&nbsp;do change, you would remember the person you used to be.  Even as
<BR>
&nbsp;your tastes, desires and beliefs change, you would continue to at
<BR>
&nbsp;least occasionally do things the way your old self would have wanted.
<BR>
&nbsp;You would cultivate a sense of connectedness to your past and future,
<BR>
&nbsp;put down roots into your own timeline.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;This could give you a more optimistic perspective as you move into
<BR>
&nbsp;a future which offers many opportunities for drastic transformation.
<BR>
&nbsp;You can have confidence that your future self will not forget who you are
<BR>
&nbsp;today, that even as you change you will preserve an element of stability.
<BR>
&nbsp;
