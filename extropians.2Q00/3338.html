<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Consider a dedicated neural &quot;processing&quot; center for i/o and decoding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (becaue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; it's bidirectional communication) - similiar to speech centers?  Add a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; capacity&quot; nerve which connects this center to an ending in, say, your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; wrist.  When a physical interface is required to an external machine,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; nano-entities create microscopic electronic passageways to the surface
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the skin, which interact directly with hardware.  Advantages to this: 1)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; might not need a &quot;standard&quot; physical interface to connect to (nanotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; adaptability), 2) probably no infection worries, 3) the nanotech could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; probably insulate the body from any raw electricity or radiation.  Also,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; since I've got nano-entities in my world - they might as well repair any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; tissue damage that does occur.  :-)  Primary disadvantage: this all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; on currently nonexistent technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Intermediate step: determine the nature of those microscopic electronic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; passageways.  Could you come up with some that could be implanted and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; left in?  If so, then there's no need for nanotech to create them on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; demand, thus bringing this much closer to current tech.  (The neural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; processing center still has to be developed, of course.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You're making sense here.  Nanotech is sexy, but not immediately practical.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;nods&gt;  It is definitely something to keep in mind long-term, though.
<BR>
Try to set a specific date now, and &gt; 99% chance you'll be too early or
<BR>
too late.  Best to keep an eye on the field (say, by reading a certain
<BR>
list which discusses that and other topics, whose name begins with
<BR>
&quot;extro&quot; ^_-), while setting up your business such that, when it does
<BR>
become close enough to practical that resources you can tap can bring it
<BR>
the rest of the way, everything else is in place.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hey, if you've got it, use it (as appropriate).  I can send you an HTML
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; version of this if you want, though it's not the best dissertation out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there, and most of what it argues for has already come into commercial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reality since it was written.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please do.
</EM><BR>
<P>Done.  (Off-list, so as not to spam those who are not interested.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Question - what is required to get regulatory approval on an invasive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prosthetic device?  What about medical associations?
</EM><BR>
<P>For the USA, at least, not that much - at least as compared to drugs.
<BR>
The less it is designed to interact with the body (at a subcellular
<BR>
level, anyway), the easier.  The trick is in how you spin it: convince
<BR>
The Powers That Be that this is as harmless as a tatoo (i.e., for the
<BR>
drive: &quot;it just sits inside the body; it don't do anything to it&quot;), and
<BR>
you've got it made.  I don't know the exact procedures at this time, but
<BR>
I'd bet that information could be extracted fairly easily from whichever
<BR>
organization you wish to get the procedures from.  (Just be able to
<BR>
recognize, and avoid asking, beauracracies which don't have
<BR>
jurisdiction.  For instance, since this is neither food nor drug, the
<BR>
Food and Drug Administration would not be my first choice to ask.  The
<BR>
mere fact of your asking may make them think they do or should have said
<BR>
jurisdiction.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Your forcing me to reevaluate - thank you.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're welcome.  I would like to see your idea become reality, too, so I
<BR>
would not mind seeing you not repeat the mistakes that I, and people
<BR>
like myself who have told me their experiences, have made.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; BTW, having retired, what would you do then?  If you've been working on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this for ten years, and now that it hits the market, people are coming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; up with all kinds of uses, would you really be content to only further
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; your vision for a mere two years?  (Maybe you *could* retire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; financially.  There's a reason why people like Bill Gates and Larry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ellison are still with their current companies, regardless of what one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thinks of said companies.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You're right, I was being dramatic.  There is almost nothing that could keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me from my work - at least, for as long as my efforts are valuable.  Anyway,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thanks for your input.  If you don't mind, I might contact you one of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; days to discuss further.
</EM><BR>
<P>No problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For now, I only have time to dream...
</EM><BR>
<P>Take this as a first round, then.  You wish to get to the point where
<BR>
you are running a startup full time with plans to implement these ideas,
<BR>
right?  By that point, you'll have to have an idea of where you'd like
<BR>
to go from there, slightly more rigorous than you already do, but that
<BR>
shouldn't be too hard to do en route.  More importantly, how do you get
<BR>
from where you are now to that situation?
<BR>
<P>The main thing you'll need is funding and a plan.  If you've got those,
<BR>
everything else can be hired or bought.  Fortunately, venture
<BR>
capitalists and other investors are willing to give you money, if you
<BR>
can convince them that your plan will give them a good return.
<BR>
Therefore, you need a business plan.
<BR>
<P>How to make a business plan?  You'll need the following:
<BR>
* summary (1-2 pages)
<BR>
* what are you trying to solve (1-2 pages)
<BR>
* proposed solution (2-3 pages)
<BR>
* target market(s) (you'll want details here)
<BR>
* existing competition (and that which could easily come up once you've
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;proved the concept)
<BR>
* design of product(s)/service(s)
<BR>
* outside components (what will you need supplied to make your stuff)
<BR>
* product development plan (machines, people, facilities, capital;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;basically, where's the most likely stumbling blocks)
<BR>
* marketing plan (you'll want details here, too)
<BR>
* financial projections (income vs. costs)
<BR>
* major risks
<BR>
* analysis of strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats
<BR>
* management plan (big companies, and even most startups, ain't exactly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;one person shows)
<BR>
<P>Cobble the outline together, then start working on those parts you think
<BR>
you can do now.  Do as much as you can; the rest, you'll have to
<BR>
research.  Schedule time and set milestones for that research; you would
<BR>
not *believe* how much that will help you avoid procrastinating forever
<BR>
(which effectively kills the whole dream - and, believe me, it's
<BR>
typically a painful death, marked by a prolonged refusal to accept the
<BR>
demise).  This is not to say you can not adjust the schedule if
<BR>
emergencies arise or certain things take longer than expected; just
<BR>
don't let any adjustments slide into procrastination.
<BR>
<P>Set a date for when you want to have a complete first draft of the
<BR>
plan...then, once you have the first draft, revise the plan, bouncing it
<BR>
off friends, especially friends in the relevant fields.  (Anyone you'd
<BR>
need an NDA for isn't worth it at this stage.)  Set a date for the
<BR>
second draft, then do one more round of bounces (no more than a couple
<BR>
weeks) before coming to the final draft.
<BR>
<P>Then, submit, submit, submit.  (Flip side for the NDAs: require them
<BR>
here, and most investors will discard your submission unread.  So,
<BR>
don't, no matter how innovative and unique and worth protecting you
<BR>
think your plan is.  Try to find out which investors have a reputation
<BR>
for ripping off plans; you can probably trust all other investors right
<BR>
now, but they've got no reason to trust you yet.)  This is the time to
<BR>
sell your plan; believe in it utterly, or they won't risk the chance
<BR>
that you're ripping them off.  Be prepared to be rejected; it doesn't
<BR>
matter how many say &quot;no&quot;, so long as one eventually says &quot;yes&quot;.  (But
<BR>
don't be afraid to ask why the nay-sayers say no: some of them might be
<BR>
willing to say yes, if you're willing to make adjustments that are
<BR>
simple to you but they don't dare ask.)
<BR>
<P>With work, perserverance, and luck - blood, sweat, and tears - you might
<BR>
just get where you want to go.  But you have to go there; dreaming is
<BR>
only the first step.
<BR>
<P>(Fair criticism: why am I not doing this myself?  Answer: I've lucked
<BR>
into a potentially more rewarding path - for the next several months, at
<BR>
least.  I'll probably do the above if and when my current work's rewards
<BR>
peter out.)
