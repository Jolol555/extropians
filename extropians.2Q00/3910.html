If it's an algorithm, it's incomplete. There will be some undecidable
<BR>
questions, which are decidable on another stronger algorithm. This
<BR>
may not bother you, but it should tell you that Truth is not an
<BR>
algorithm, that it cannot be reached, or even defined, algorithmically.
<BR>
Dan Fabulich
<BR>
<P>Sure - but this isn't a practical problem anymore than the
<BR>
incompleteness of number theory makes math useless. It's a good
<BR>
objection though. Saying intelligence is an algorithm was sloppy of
<BR>
me, I should say rather that intelligence is that which approximates
<BR>
some particular uncomputable function in a tractable way. This opens
<BR>
up the possibility of multiple viable solutions.
<BR>
Matt Gingell
<BR>
<P>Minds are imperfect and heuristic, they only approximate a truth which
<BR>
is, as you point out, uncomputable. A machine might out do us, as
<BR>
Newton was out done by Einstein, by finding a better model than
<BR>
ours. But any intelligent machine would have a concept of, say,
<BR>
integer at least as an special case of something (perhaps vastly)
<BR>
broader.
<BR>
Matt Gingell
<BR>
<P>I wonder if some non standard logic, and (above all) the well-known
<BR>
intensional logic, could help (AI) to find the right track.

<P>1)
<BR>
Intensional logic. 
<BR>
Intensional (or indexical) logic is the study of assertions and other
<BR>
expressions whose meaning depends on an implicit context or index, such as
<BR>
time or spatial position. This type of logic was originally developed (by
<BR>
Kripke, Carnap, Montague and others) to help understand natural language, in
<BR>
which such expressions abound. The term ³indexical logic² is also used, Many
<BR>
groups are interested in the indexical (Kripke-style) semantics, in which
<BR>
context sensitive expressions are interpreted as denoting values which vary
<BR>
over a space of indicies (or &quot;possible worlds&quot;). Many groups are interested
<BR>
in the prescriptive use of indexical logic, to define new (programming)
<BR>
languages equipped with indexical operators, rather than describe existing
<BR>
(natural) languages.
<BR>
<P>2) 
<BR>
Intensional logic. 
<BR>
Intensional logic is a family of mathematical formal systems that allow
<BR>
expressions whose value depends on hidden context or indices. Streams are
<BR>
considered an intensional mapping, in the sense that neither the source nor
<BR>
the destination need be aware of the &quot;hidden&quot; destination coordinates. Each
<BR>
merely produces/consumes a one dimensional stream of data to be mapped by
<BR>
whatever stream implementation using &quot;hidden&quot; state (coordinates) to direct
<BR>
the mapping.
<BR>
<P>3) 
<BR>
Intensional logic. 
<BR>
Logics that include apparatus for signifying when two meanings (as opposed
<BR>
to two wffs, truth-values, sets, predicates, functions) are identical, and
<BR>
that analyzes inferences involving meanings. (Non-intensional logics are
<BR>
called extensional.)

Non-monotonic logic.
<BR>
Logics in which the set of implications determined by a given group of
<BR>
premises does not necessarily grow, and can shrink, when new wffs are added
<BR>
to the set of premises.
