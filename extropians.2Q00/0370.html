<EM>&gt; Good effort Ziana. They don't mention that if the registered owner isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; home and his wife gets attacked by a rapist/robber/murderer, she has no hope
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of defending herself or the kids. So you buy your wife a gun, fine.  Your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kids, who under such circumstances are most likely to not be theobject of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immediate attention, actually have a very good chance of being the ones to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retreive either weapon, neither of which they can use. Smartguns are for

<EM>&gt; Could a 'supersmart' gun be designed that has two or more people that are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to use it?  Both a husband and wife?  That would solve much of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't discount the possibility, and if such is possible (it likely is) I will
<BR>
adamantly say that it should not be mandated until the technology can be
<BR>
integrated into any gun of any price teir. The fact is that the 'smart'
<BR>
technologies that are out right now are highly restrictive, highly prone to
<BR>
failure, and add a minimum of $1000.00 on the price of any given gun. When your
<BR>
average pistol costs $350.00-450.00, putting what amounts to a 200% tax on the
<BR>
gun only does one thing: it makes it impossible for poor people, who are most
<BR>
likely to live in high crime areas and are most freqently victims of crime (and
<BR>
are most likely of a minority group), to defend themselves against crime. This
<BR>
is an elitist and racist policy to propose until it can be afforded by all. The
<BR>
dirty little secret of the Democratic Party is that most gun control laws passed
<BR>
prior to 1950 were part of Jim Crow legislation. What cop is gonna let a black
<BR>
man carry a gun?
<BR>
<P>Back to the cost: Those that claim the logic can be designed into a single chip
<BR>
and made for a few cents are thinking in the wrong scale. Chip efficiencies of
<BR>
scale of this magnitude occur when you reach hundreds of thousands, if not
<BR>
millions of units each year. While a couple million guns are sold each year in
<BR>
the US at most, they are made by several dozen gun manufacturers. Each one of
<BR>
these manufacturers will have to come up with its own chip design (if not
<BR>
multiple chip designs), since sharing designs like this is collusion and an
<BR>
anti-trust actionable offense. Each manufacturer will never make more than a
<BR>
hundred thousand or so chips a year. For those of you in chip design, who might
<BR>
want to advance gun technology so that it is affordable, I suggest you make a
<BR>
chip design, and make it free and open source like linux is, start manufacturing
<BR>
up, and get the prices down. And design it so that the government can't use it
<BR>
as a means of gun control/registration/permitting.
