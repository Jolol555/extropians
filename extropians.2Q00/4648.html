<BR>
<EM>&gt; In the chart you link to, the bonds are long term and were subject to more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years of inflation than deflation during the years covered.  This would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be the case with the strategy I suggested of buying only short term bonds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that T-bills are not a good investment for the long term.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed that a short-maturity strategy mitigates much of the interest rate
<BR>
risk while usually providing a better overall yield than just holding cash,
<BR>
however equity investments _over time_ have always outperformed this.  I
<BR>
read a reference today while tracking that other chart down that showed that
<BR>
there has been no 25 year period in which you would not have done better
<BR>
invested in the stock market than in cash or bonds.. it was on the Motley
<BR>
Fool site but I'm not at that machine now so I don't have the URL.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As the standard deviations for the 3 asset classes indicate, stock returns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are far more volatile than returns on bonds.  If you take a smaller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assortment of stocks, which is what most people end up with, the volatility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be even greater.  Most people, if they purchase stocks for their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; portfolios, can't afford to diversify widely, and mutual fund managers don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to have all that good of a track record.
</EM><BR>
<P>This may have been somewhat true in the past but is no longer so, as
<BR>
mutual funds are widely available and easy to purchase.  As plenty of, say,
<BR>
Vanguard literature would say, a market index fund, such as their S&amp;P 500
<BR>
trust, by _definition_ (because it's a market index fund..) will have as good
<BR>
a track record as the market proxy itself (less the minimal administrative
<BR>
costs associated with running the portfolio).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Some volatility wouldn't hurt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you were prepared to hang on for the long term, it's true.  And a person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could transfer their money out of stocks and into bonds at retirement age
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they want to withdraw money periodically. But what if a person reached
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retirement age just as the market went into a slump of several years'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; duration? Also, some of the volatility which appears negligible on a chart
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; translates into rather severe losses for the individual investor.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed that with a limited portfolio and/or a short term time horizon,
<BR>
an investor is wide open to all sorts of volatility, in either direction,
<BR>
and that the stock market isn't an appropriate place for funds which you
<BR>
will _need_ in the shorter term.  (_that's_ where short term bonds shine).
<BR>
As you approach, say, retirement, or any other point where you're going
<BR>
to need the money, it's prudent to trim down risk - though many advisors
<BR>
recommend that even retirees stay mostly invested in the stock market -
<BR>
i.e. if you plan to retire at the historical 65 and you plan to live to,
<BR>
oh, well into your 90s (900s? let's be extropian?), that's a long time
<BR>
for any volatility to shake itself out.  With mutual funds no one need be
<BR>
open to the risk (or, as always, the reward..) of individual stocks.. but
<BR>
as you point out, many fund managers don't have great records - when
<BR>
compared to the benchmarks they follow.  Hence indexing.
<BR>
<P>There are shelves full of books and web sites on basic investment strategy
<BR>
which go into this in excruciating detail.. the Motley Fool (www.fool.com)
<BR>
is among the best IMO.. (and I don't consider myself a great investor
<BR>
by any means.. way way too risk averse for my own good, but I'm getting
<BR>
better :-)).  There's nothing wrong with any investment strategy, provided
<BR>
it matches your own goals, personal preferences, and comfort levels - a
<BR>
strategy is still somewhat successful IMO if you lose money over time,
<BR>
but you can sleep at night and you value that.  But the way I see it,
<BR>
returns of investments (over time intervals that are appropriate for the
<BR>
investment!) are measured quantities; it's a matter of math, and if you're
<BR>
looking for returns over the long run, historically, the results say you
<BR>
need to be in the stock market.
<BR>
<P>(standard industry disclaimer: &quot;Past performance is no guarantee of
<BR>
future results&quot; :-) )
