I consider the pledge of allegiance to be falsely directed. The pledge 
<BR>
should be directed toward the Constitution, a copy of which should be in 
<BR>
every classroom. I don't see this as a bad thing at all. Pledging allegiance 
<BR>
to a flag, that can mean whatever the government and the media want it to 
<BR>
mean, is a rather empty and mindless task.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I think this is a very profound idea.  It deserves to be pushed forward 
<BR>
somehow.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
You only deserve to die if you've proven you are unfit to live. The unborn 
<BR>
haven't even been given the chance... a woman who aborts is admitting either 
<BR>
that she will be an unfit mother, or that she has so little regard for the 
<BR>
life of others. Either way, its a toss up. Do you want to put a baby in the 
<BR>
hands of someone like that? I don't, which is why despite my misgivings 
<BR>
about the morality of it, I think abortion is the lesser of two evils. By 
<BR>
aborting, she's making sure there are fewer people like her (and the father) 
<BR>
in the world. Abortion and execution: I just call it evolution in action.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>This is a touchy and complex issue.  I would prefer the child to be born and 
<BR>
at least have an opportunity, no matter how limited, to have a life that 
<BR>
counts for something.
<BR>
<P>Some minority leaders have claimed that Planned Parenthood has a secret 
<BR>
agenda to 'trim' poor and dysfunctional black and hispanic populations.  I 
<BR>
was quite surprised to read this.
<BR>
<P>Mike, quite honestly, you should be a radio talk-show personality.  If your 
<BR>
personality and intelligence comes through half as well as it does in your 
<BR>
writings, you would be a serious contender.  You could be the Rush Limbaugh 
<BR>
of transhumanism!  ;)
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
