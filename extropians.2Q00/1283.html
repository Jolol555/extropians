<P>There is a difference between the 'slacker' and the criminal.  The slackers 
<BR>
I know may be somewhat lazy but would never mug or burglarize.  They simply 
<BR>
use any gov't aid they qualify for, mooch off family and friends, eat at 
<BR>
soup kitchens, only work part-time or don't work at all and live at home if 
<BR>
they can.  Despite this, the very idea of committing serious crimes is 
<BR>
appalling to them.  But a criminal sees that as a real option.  I realize 
<BR>
there is a time when a person decides to make that leap but usually 
<BR>
shoplifting and other crimes have been going on since childhood and went 
<BR>
unpunished which created the foundation for such serious behavior.

This really naive. Again, 'things will sort themselves out&quot;.It's not the 
<BR>
only alternative to starvation is it? Crime pays way better.
<BR>
Don't kid yourself that MacDonalds will suddenly be better stocked with 
<BR>
uneducated unskilled able-bodied humans. (Someone, maybe you, pointed out 
<BR>
that in the US anyone able-bodied can already get a job in janitorial or 
<BR>
fast food there's an abundance of socially demeaning shitjobs at below 
<BR>
poverty level wages.)
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's time to GET PAID!!&quot; Ever hear that expression?  In certain subcultures 
<BR>
it sure does not mean go to the office and pick up your check!  It means 
<BR>
time to rob and steal other human beings with the very real threat of 
<BR>
violence.  Nadia, it must be very interesting doing art with gang kids to 
<BR>
say the least.
<BR>
<P>Crime does pay WAY better generally then a minimum wage job.  At least 
<BR>
temporarily and immediate gratification is part of the life style and way of 
<BR>
thinking here.  Often criminals have a warped sense of pride that tells them 
<BR>
that working for a low wage or simply doing any manual labor for any wage is 
<BR>
an insult to them.  I have seen a number of documentaries where this is 
<BR>
shown, over and over again.  They would bristle and finally quit if they 
<BR>
worked at a fast food joint and had to accept the rules and belittling that 
<BR>
comes with such a job.
<BR>
<P>A local fast food manager in Anchorage was shot and killed by some of the 
<BR>
very kids she had hired to work for her, she had 'disrespected' them by 
<BR>
asking for their shirts to be tucked in!

Then you also insist the government shouldn't supply education, and impose

guidelines for minimum wages, or support job training (with our taxes)

stores or run drugs.

<BR>
<P>I agree that there needs to be proper funding for programs like this.  But 
<BR>
they need to be competently designed and run.  It is cheaper over the short 
<BR>
term to maintain the welfare status quo rather then try to educate and 
<BR>
employ the poor.
<BR>
<P>I have heard it said that these programs ultimately help those who on their 
<BR>
own could have probably made it(since they had ambition and desire) and that 
<BR>
the folks who are seen as the most in 'need' of the help just don't want it. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is a generalization and I am sure in many instances people got 
<BR>
the boost they absolutely had to have to succeed.

It is perfectly possible for a single adult to survive on one of these jobs, 
<BR>
even today. If you got rid of all the stupid laws that drive up the price of 
<BR>
living (rent controls, crop price supports, etc.) he might even be able to 
<BR>
afford a few luxuries (like TV, air conditioning, telephones, movies, eating 
<BR>
out, etc.).
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Survive yes, but not thrive.  Hard to impress the ladies when you are barely 
<BR>
getting by!!  I know that!  &quot;No money, no honey!&quot;  But then, getting an 
<BR>
education is what a person must focus their energies on to get the things 
<BR>
they want.  And this involves self-discipline, at least some intelligence, 
<BR>
mentors and belief in yourself.  As a SINGLE person it is possible to get by 
<BR>
on a low minimum wage paycheck.  And you better have a roommate to halve the 
<BR>
expenses with and that is trustworthy.
<BR>
<P><P>you continue:
<BR>
But the real advantage for the individual of working (rather than being on 
<BR>
the dole) is that they aren't stuck in the same place forever.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Very good point.  There is at least some chance for them to improve their 
<BR>
lot.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
Look at the careers of people who actually do this kind of work long-term, 
<BR>
and you'll find that they tend to work their way up to a better standard of 
<BR>
living eventually.
<BR>
<P>They 'tend' to.  Some can work at a retailer for fifteen years and never 
<BR>
make management because they are not interested and also don't really have 
<BR>
the ability.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
There is a long ladder of unskilled and semi-skilled jobs, stretching from  
<BR>
minimum wage scut work on up to $25,000/yr salaried junior managers, that a 
<BR>
worker can climb based on nothing but perseverance and a little on-the-job 
<BR>
training. Almost no one gets stuck at the very bottom for long.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Some do have the ambition and brains to move on up fairly quickly and others 
<BR>
do not.  I currently work fulltime at a Fred Meyers store (a very large 
<BR>
retailer in the western U.S.) as a Home dept. floorperson/cashier(at age 33, 
<BR>
time to get my act together and finish college!) and see the process you 
<BR>
have described.  I sometimes feel sorry for my managers who I think are 
<BR>
sometimes on the verge of nervous breakdowns(I hope not because of me).  The 
<BR>
jr. manager who trained me has since resigned his managerial position due to 
<BR>
stress.  I sure don't want the spot.
<BR>
<P>The fellow who interviewed and hired me is the deputy director of the store 
<BR>
and the home section chief.  He only has a little college under his belt but 
<BR>
is very sharp and a strong natural leader.  I see how native intelligence is 
<BR>
important in getting ahead even at this level.  The pressure of a wife and 
<BR>
child on the way as a younger man meant perhaps not going as far 
<BR>
educationally as he could have considering his talents.  But he is now in 
<BR>
training to head his own store and will at that point be making a salary 
<BR>
that will be very competitive by most professional standards.  He is now 
<BR>
finding his niche among the 'cognitive elite' who are ambitious also.
<BR>
