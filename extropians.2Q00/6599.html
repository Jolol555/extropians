<P>
(From virtual hub, so if formatting is off, sorry.)
<BR>
<P>Life extension programs are varied and there are many practices
<BR>
to follow. Because different outcomes are sought, developing
<BR>
consistent and compatible programs tend to produce the most favorable
<BR>
results. Not all life extension programs and practices are designed
<BR>
and implemented exclusively for the physical outcomes.  Mental
<BR>
adjustments are necessary.  Often, if there is an imbalance in
<BR>
how a person perceives himself and what the mirror reflects,
<BR>
and such imbalance can interfere with the very concept of life
<BR>
extension practices.
<BR>
<P>Having tinkered around a bit, knowledge + common sense is probably
<BR>
the best life extension practice and it's very  basic:  exercise,
<BR>
relax, sleep, love your work, drink water, eat healthy food.
<BR>
&nbsp;Don't gorge, don't eat while stressed, refrain from too much
<BR>
sugar, too much alcohol, too much food. Have yearly checkups,
<BR>
learn about your body, develop your mind, brush your teeth. 
<BR>
Mediate, stretch, soak in baths, learn something new each day,
<BR>
joy, cheerfulness, optimism, love, and the list goes on.  The
<BR>
implementation of a healthy lifestyle, by its own virtue, is
<BR>
the foundation of life extension.  But, the mind needs to understand
<BR>
what *healthy* means.
<BR>
<P>Re CR: I practice restricting calories, but not as Roy Walford
<BR>
has so effectively designed CR.  I think that there might be
<BR>
a propensity for specific types of individuals to get carried
<BR>
away with CR.  It works very well for some people, but not others.
<BR>
&nbsp;However, one does not have to be on such a rigorous program
<BR>
to practice caloric restriction.
<BR>
<P>Re Exercise: I don't know why exercising is problematic for many
<BR>
people.  It's such a great way to spend time.  It is time alone
<BR>
to be with oneself:  both in focus (like in a zen space); or
<BR>
to let the mind wander anywhere it wants to (like free falling
<BR>
creatively).  It's probably the best one aspect of life extension
<BR>
that we can do for ourselves. 
<BR>
<P>Developing an individual, healthy lifestyle, can go in many directions
<BR>
and some of them are very far out.  Life extension is not just
<BR>
maintaining the body, it's also gaining knowledge of future technologies
<BR>
that will aid and assist a person's specific genetic makeup and
<BR>
personal and psychological needs.  
<BR>
<P>***ALL THE MORE REASON FOR An LE LIST FOLKS!!***
<BR>
<P>Actually, this list works well, don't you think.  I mean, we
<BR>
have been discussing our minds and our bodies all along and certainly
<BR>
what we do on a daily basis is part and parcel to the daily extension
<BR>
of our lives.  Uploading is an aspect of life extension, and
<BR>
what knowledge we have about a Singularity is an aspect of life
<BR>
extension. Recently, there was a series of posts about what we
<BR>
would do if money and technology was not an issue.  Even knowing
<BR>
how to deal with flamboyant ecentric Greens or luddites helps
<BR>
with life extension. Perhaps we might discuss physical aspects
<BR>
more often, such as weight lifting, and I would certainly be
<BR>
happy about this.  Or, discuss enhancements to the body and senses,
<BR>
which would make me very happy (thus adding years to my own life
<BR>
-:)
<BR>
<P>How we deal with life's issues, each aspect of it, is crucial
<BR>
to the amalgamation of extending life.  Most topics, although
<BR>
at first blush don't seem to pertain to life extension, actually
<BR>
do -- even in off-handed ways.
