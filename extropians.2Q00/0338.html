<EM>&gt; &gt; Removing the Internet Explorer &quot;E&quot; icon is not feasible.  It is scary for

<EM>&gt; &gt; neophyte users.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone who is that much of a neophyte isn't going to have an opinion about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what browser they want to use, either.  I mean, come on, all you have to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is click on it and hit the delete key.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>This action does not remove &quot;Internet Explorer&quot;, only the desktop shortcut to
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And for people who really are that ignorant of computers, the fact that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't have to worry about choosing a browser unless they want to is a big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As aWindows user, what I want is the ability to add and remove all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; components of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the operating system and rebuild the kernel fine-tuned to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specifications.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Also, as I am paranoid, I want to verify system security which is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feasible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; otherwise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cool.  I want world peace, a billion dollars and &lt;obscene comments deleted&gt;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does that mean I can reasonably complain if I don't get what I want?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>If you paid some place claiming to provide world peace, an investment stake, or
<BR>
whatever, then you would expect the ability to do with it as you please after it
<BR>
is in your possession, or in the case of world peace, to get some world peace.
<BR>
So, I am aware that the license agreement is not agreed to by the general user
<BR>
because by the time they purchase the PC it is already installed, so that they
<BR>
are receiving on their PC software for which they have paid money and it is then
<BR>
in their possession.
<BR>
<P>The point here is that Microsoft has received money for the privilege of having
<BR>
the operating system installed already.
<BR>
<P>So, in terms of cars, if I buy some automobile and want to replace parts of the
<BR>
engine, this is possible, although I'm not an expert mechanic so would not
<BR>
attempt that.  In the frame of reference of computers, though, say I want to
<BR>
chop out 95% of the network stack, everything except the driver code for my
<BR>
hardware peripheral configuration, user interface libs and kernel32 and msgsrv32
<BR>
and perhaps a very few other things, and those basic system processes having
<BR>
been fine-tuned to eliminate bloat, then that is a good thing to want for what I
<BR>
have paid for it.  For the car I can get the specifications.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Making Windows highly configurable is actually a fairly big priority with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft, but there are limits to what is practical. Customers also have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lots of other things they want, like perfect stability, an infinite number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of new features, and smaller/faster software.  You can't have all of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things at once, no matter how much money you spend.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it is not so difficult, not to say I think I could have it done in a
<BR>
week, to have a list of the dependencies of each software module and a simple
<BR>
program to remove a bunch of them.
<BR>
<P>In the terms of the OS kernel, along similar lines options could be built into
<BR>
the source code and any sophisticated user could roll their own.
<BR>
<P>This separate, it seems that stability is with smaller/faster software against
<BR>
new features.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, as a user of this software for which money was indirectly tendered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Microsoft, I am the customer, and thus always right, and so want the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to build my own compiler and kernel, and basic operating system services,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be able to then pick and choose what operating system enhancements I find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; relevant, and then to pick and choose application software that best fits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; personal requirements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you want Linux, use Linux.  Most people emphatically do NOT want to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to do such things, and that's the market MS is targeting.  Their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approach is to give users and administrators nice GUI interfaces for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything they say they want to be able to manipulate, and then bury
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything else under a layer of automation so that no one has to worry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about it.

<P>Linux illustrates that a complete operating system can be built on stock
<BR>
machines from source code with the luxury of optional operating system
<BR>
components, this from a group of volunteers.
<BR>
<P>I guess the point here is that Microsoft has received money for this operating
<BR>
system from any user of it, so that the user should have the option to modify it
<BR>
upon installation or after this operating system is running on the hardware.
