<P>And do you really think there is a snowball's chance in hell of Congress
<BR>
ever passing a law requiring universal surveillance unless they included
<BR>
an exception for themselves and the President?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; No encryption is unbreakable, that is just a fact.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it is not a fact. Quantum Encryption, which has actually been used in
<BR>
a commercial setting not just in the lab, is as secure as the laws of physics.
<BR>
<P>But that's probably overkill. I'm looking at page 158 of Applied Cryptography
<BR>
by Bruce Schneier, a nanocomputer using the full power of the sun with a
<BR>
Dyson sphere could crack a 192 bit symmetric key by brute force in 32
<BR>
years, if you went to 193 bit it would take 64 years. Granted that's only a
<BR>
brute force attack but if you basing your society on the assumption that it's
<BR>
practical and economical to break any cipher then you're heading for trouble.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Further, if such cypherpunk activities are criminalized, the very act of
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;attempting to use encryption for the purpose of tampering with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;public record would likely be construed to be a forfeiture of your rights.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you need to learn a little more about cryptography. There are ways of
<BR>
using DC nets so that you not only don't know what I'm saying you don't even
<BR>
know who I'm talking to. There are ways of using Steganography so you not
<BR>
only don't know who I'm talking to, you don't even know that I'm talking. There are
<BR>
ways of putting information in a form so that it's useful to me and nobody else,
<BR>
or if I prefer, I can make it useful to you and me and nobody else. There are ways
<BR>
I can prove that I have a certain piece of secret information without giving you the
<BR>
slightest clue as to what that information is.
