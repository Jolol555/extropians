<EM>&gt; &gt; Saying that lawyers have a &quot;monopoly&quot; on the practice of law is like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  that licensed drivers have a monopoly on driving.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't think so.  First, the &quot;barriers to entry&quot; for getting a driver's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;license are pretty low (all you have to do is drive on the freeway to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this :-).  Second, lots of people drive without licenses.  So long as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;careful, you'll never be caught.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are more than a few cases of people practicing law without a license 
<BR>
for several years without getting caught.  That's not much of a distinction 
<BR>
between the two.
<BR>
<P>While I stand by my original comparison, I would point out that we're not 
<BR>
really talking about the mere practice of law, which *anyone* is allowed to 
<BR>
do, whether or not they have any legal education whatsoever, so long as 
<BR>
one's only client is oneself.  But where you cross the line to providing 
<BR>
professional, fiduciary advice to someone else, you are really holding 
<BR>
yourself out to have a minimum of expertise in the field.  In which case it 
<BR>
only makes sense that there is some governing/oversight body to make sure 
<BR>
that you do in fact have that minimum level of expertise.
<BR>
<P>The fact that this body happens to be a state bar association, again, does 
<BR>
not render the practice of law a monopoly.  The anti-trust laws are 
<BR>
ostensibly designed to insure fair competition in the marketplace for the 
<BR>
protection of the public.  There is certainly a good healthy dose of 
<BR>
competition in the field (just look in your local yellow pages under 
<BR>
&quot;attorneys&quot;).  The state bar is designed primarily to insure that those of 
<BR>
you in the legal-services-purchasing public are guaranteed some minimum 
<BR>
level of competence when paying someone who holds himself out as a legal 
<BR>
professional.  If you want to save money and/or have an incompetent for an 
<BR>
attorney, you are free to represent yourself.
