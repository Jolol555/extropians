<P>
Brian, it's obvious that you have some serious political disagreements with 
<BR>
not only Extropians but perhaps most other transhumanists. Since you don't 
<BR>
distinctly lay out your views, I'm not sure how much and where you 
<BR>
disagree, but I get the impression that you favor a strong state that would 
<BR>
regulate transhumanizing technologies. Rather than speculating further, 
<BR>
I'll stick to responding to your comments.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I let the first comment (the first paragraph above go by),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but this is too much. First, yes many extropians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; call themselves libertarian or are very sympathetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to libertarian approaches. This is true of very many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; transhumanists, Extropians or not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, you agree. So why did you originally point at finger at Extropians, 
<BR>
rather than at us and all the other transhumanists whose political views 
<BR>
differ from yours? If you don't want me to think that you're attacking 
<BR>
Extropians, then perhaps it would help for you to include in your critique 
<BR>
all other relevant transhumanists.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But please not that, if you read the Extropian Principles,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; libertarianism is not mentioned.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;True, but not relevant.
</EM><BR>
<P>You've lost me. How can this not be relevant? Extropianism is defined in 
<BR>
terms of the Extropian Principles. The Principles do NOT require a 
<BR>
libertarian political view. I don't even call myself a libertarian. It 
<BR>
seems to me that what you have a problem with is individualism, and almost 
<BR>
all transhumanists that I've come across are strong individualists, even if 
<BR>
they do not call themselves libertarians and do not agree with all of what 
<BR>
libertarians say. Again, why specifically criticize Extropians if your beef 
<BR>
is with individualism? (It would help if you stated your political/economic 
<BR>
perspective.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Extropians need not be libertarians.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This seems difficult to believe (In truth, Max, I'm surprised at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your efforts [here, and in the past] to distance Extropianism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from libertarianism. There can be a right-wing trans-humanism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and a left-wing. Extropianism can be the right-wing version. Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should that be a problem for you?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Two things here: First, your use of &quot;right-wing&quot; and &quot;left-wing&quot; is just 
<BR>
going to add to the confusion. That one-dimensional categorization of 
<BR>
political views is almost worthless even without getting into any 
<BR>
transhumanist ideas. Describing Extropians as &quot;right-wing&quot; is unhelpful. 
<BR>
&quot;Right-wing&quot; covers an enormously diverse range of views. Perhaps that's 
<BR>
the source of your problem--you are taking some unsavory views labeled as 
<BR>
&quot;right-wing&quot; and assuming they apply to other people some of whose views 
<BR>
might be called &quot;right-wing&quot; in a different sense. That would explain your 
<BR>
comments about anti-Semitism (which I find bizarre and which I'm sure will 
<BR>
surprise my friend and long-time Extropian Simon Levy).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Brian's comments are more disturbing. They seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; extremely unfair, and misrepresent the Extropians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on the Extropian list (quite apart from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; broader community of Extropians beyond the list).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(For the record, I just want to clarify that I was referring to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the people one encounters in the main mailing list, and not all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of them at that.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm glad you say &quot;seem,&quot; though am disturbed that by the end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;here you've devolved to presumptuous charges of &quot;slander.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>You *did* misrepresent the people on the list. You did not qualify your 
<BR>
statements. That would lead most readers to assume that you were talking 
<BR>
about a universal or near-universal set of views about the issues you 
<BR>
mentioned. My assumption of slander is based on the manner in which you 
<BR>
singled out Extropians for a criticism that applies to other transhumanists 
<BR>
and which unreasonably overgeneralized from the views of a tiny fraction of 
<BR>
the list. Perhaps you were not slandering. The alternative is that you 
<BR>
expressed yourself very inaccurately and incautiously.
<BR>
<P>Brian, I have to say that your comments about anti-Semitism seem so far 
<BR>
off-base to me that I find it hard to respond. Your evidence for 
<BR>
anti-Semitism appears to be (a) that some people on the list argued that 
<BR>
circumcision is a bad idea (apparently contrary to your religious or 
<BR>
cultural views); (b) that people have mentioned Ayn Rand's Jewish birth 
<BR>
name (!!); (c) that libertarianism is inherently anti-Semitic.
<BR>
<P>The first piece of &quot;evidence&quot; is just incredible. You call for freedom to 
<BR>
criticize, yet apparently bristle when a practice that you favor 
<BR>
(circumcision) is challenged. Surely you can see that *even if* (contrary 
<BR>
to fact) all and only Jews were circumcised, critical discussion of 
<BR>
circumcision would not in the least imply anti-Semitism. It would imply 
<BR>
anti-circumcisionism among those who took that view. (I have no idea how 
<BR>
many Extropians or other transhumanists favor, oppose, or don't give a hoot 
<BR>
about circumcision.)
<BR>
<P>As for libertarianism being inherently anti-Semitic, this is laughable. You 
<BR>
mentioned Ayn Rand as someone many Extropians like (though many also 
<BR>
strongly dislike her work, or parts of it). She is of Jewish background. So 
<BR>
are numerous leading libertarian thinkers, such as Murray Rothbard and 
<BR>
Israel Kirzner. Come on, Brian, you're really off-base here. The fact that 
<BR>
you would try to stretch an already-incredible statement about libertarians 
<BR>
to smear Extropians with anti-Semitism does make me think that either you 
<BR>
are deliberately slandering Extropians, or else you have some paranoia 
<BR>
about the issue.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;#2 would be the strongest, except that I've only seen it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exemplified occasionally. About #1: there's a long literature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about the anti-Semitic implications of irrational circumcision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussions.
</EM><BR>
<P>And, of course, all discussions of circumcision that reach a conclusion 
<BR>
different from yours are irrational? (Now I think we're clear what's going 
<BR>
on here!)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm appalled that someone who started a movement that claims to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want to do good things would raise the charge of slander without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yet hearing the reasons for the charges purported to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;slanderous. (Worse, still, you even claimed not to have read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;every Extropians post.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Guilty as charged. Your honor, it's true--I have not read every post on the 
<BR>
Extropians list. I can't have read more than a couple of hundred thousand. 
<BR>
Brian, again, I will adjust my proposal this way: Either you are slandering 
<BR>
us, or else you are being exceedingly careless in your reasoning. It's 
<BR>
because of your intelligence that the latter did not occur to me.
<BR>
<P>As for the person telling you that I'm the root of all evil... Yes, I must 
<BR>
say that that person (don't assume it was a he) apparently did have some 
<BR>
affect on your thinking. &quot;Natasha's ex-boyfriend&quot;? Now who's making 
<BR>
assumptions? I've been the subject of enough death threats, and lesser 
<BR>
insults and attacks. I can handle those, but it bothers me when people lie 
<BR>
about me and succeed in slanting people against me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A movement that can't tolerate criticism -- SHARP criticism even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-- is dangerous.
</EM><BR>
<P>Very true. And one that fails to defend itself against false charges is 
<BR>
vulnerable to serious damage.
