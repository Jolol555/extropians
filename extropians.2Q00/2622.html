<EM>&gt;From: &quot;John Calvin&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mercurial@disinfo.net?Subject=Re:%20Transparent%20Society&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000508202109.13964.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">mercurial@disinfo.net</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What would the possibility of a Transparent society happening prior to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advent of the sane laws that would protect the innocent individual.
</EM><BR>
<P>IMO, while certainly possible, that scenario is not very likely.  In the 
<BR>
majority of developed nations such &quot;sane&quot; laws are already in place.  I 
<BR>
could forsee such a scenario happening in, say, China.  But I believe that 
<BR>
communiation and totalitarianism are, in the long term, mutually exclusive.  
<BR>
As more and more of her citizens make use of such communications media as 
<BR>
faxes, phones and (most importantly) the internet in communicating with the 
<BR>
&quot;free world&quot;, I believe the days of totalitarianism in China are numbered.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;you know. Also, the responsible agencies would be held accountable for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;their actions by the public, so if they made a false arrest and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;made a stink about it they would have to explain their actions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The above ought to be the way it works now, however there do appear to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;examples of the State running roughshod over individual rights with no 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;forthcoming explanation or accountability.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  But it seems (to me at least) that the rate of such incidents is 
<BR>
increasingly decreasing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;If we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;assume a transparent society where &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;not hold or antiterrorism laws are applied with very little factual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;support, then there will likely be enough such cases for a very strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;public opinion to correct the system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I agree, and I believe that it might be a long and painful process getting 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there.
</EM><BR>
<P>No matter what, the process is likely to be long (and for some, painful).  
<BR>
This should come as no surprise when you look at previous societal paradigm 
<BR>
shifts (slavery abolition, civil rights, universal sufferage, etc.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Brin makes a point about the importance of the feedback from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;public in maintaining a democratic open society. If everything is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;entrusted into the hands of experts and their AIs, then the society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will not remain democratic and open for long. Transparency has to act
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;both ways.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I agree, it seems that the question would then be, what do we do to make 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sure that the transparency does in fact go both ways.
</EM><BR>
<P>That, I think, is simple.  We simply *demand* it.  The same way the 
<BR>
&quot;cypherpunks&quot; demand their right to encrypt and the same way the NRA demands 
<BR>
that the right to bear arms not be abridged.  Of course their is no 
<BR>
guarantee that &quot;we&quot; will succeed.  This, like many issues, will be tried in 
<BR>
the court of public opinion.  Its merits may overwhelm public attitudes to 
<BR>
the extent that it sweeps in like an unopposable juggernaut (like civil 
<BR>
rights for blacks), or it may get mired down in a decades long &quot;war&quot; of 
<BR>
attrition, with public attitudes vascillating, stagnated or changing ever so 
<BR>
slowly (like the abortion debate).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;On this issue I am somewhat pessimistic, much of the general populace 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;already allows many of their personal decisions to be made by a bias media, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and simply claim that they do not have time to do the math and figure 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;things out for themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with your assessment of the current state of political affairs.  But 
<BR>
I don't think that is necessarily cause for pessimism.  I think it just 
<BR>
shows where the most target rich environment is for the campaign (the biased 
<BR>
media).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Leaving out the personal attacks between Mike Lorrey and Zero Powers, Their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussion has provided a great deal of food for thought.
</EM><BR>
<P>Alas, then *some* good has come of it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I agree with Mr. Powers that a Transparent society may be inevitable, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that being the case wonder what we can do to make sure that it is in fact a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I also agree with Mr. Lorrey that given the current state of affairs we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;must be very concerned with the possibility of a transparent society and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;keep aware that it might not be a good thing at all, but rather turn us 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into a very civil but restrained and paranoid semi-hive culture.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not &quot;poo-poo&quot; this outlook.  I realize that ever-present surveillance 
<BR>
confers a great deal of power upon the surveiller.  Not being one of the 
<BR>
governing elite myself, I would suffer as much as the next guy from an 
<BR>
over-powerful surveillance state run amok.  However, I am convinced that the 
<BR>
American people are adroit enough to make a big enough stink at the first 
<BR>
sign of Big Brother to ensure that he never gets a chance to raise his ugly 
<BR>
head.
<BR>
<P>As it stands now the government, at times, is forced to virtual inaction for 
<BR>
fear of public outcry over the post-mortem analysis of its actions.  Witness 
<BR>
the recent Elian Gonzalez matter.  IMO Reno was so afraid of going through 
<BR>
what she went through following the Branch Davidian fiasco, that she did 
<BR>
everything she could to reach a mutually agreeable resolution between the 
<BR>
participants in the Elian affair.  She coddled, and coddled and coddled some 
<BR>
more the Miami relatives, and extended deadline after deadline, to the point 
<BR>
where the Miami relatives felt that there was nothing they could do to 
<BR>
provoke Reno into action.  They basically snubbed, taunted and dared her 
<BR>
every step of the way.  Their shocked reaction now probably arises more from 
<BR>
their surprise that Reno actually did have the cojones to get up off her 
<BR>
butt and enforce the law, than that she did it improperly.
<BR>
<P>I realize that Reno is not the government, and that her days are numbered.  
<BR>
But I think the point remains.  Public opinion is a powerful motivator to 
<BR>
those in elected office and to those who are appointed by elected officials. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It all comes down to the court of public opinion, if government actions so 
<BR>
offended the passions of a great enough segment of the Americann population, 
<BR>
I just don't see anyway those actions could continue for long, including the 
<BR>
implementation of one-way surveillance.
<BR>
<P><P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
