</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In 2050, there will still be &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; but the definitions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will have changed.  This has been talked about on the list before,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certainly.  A 2050 &quot;have-not&quot; may have a lifestyle that only a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;multi-millioniare has now, and yet will feel frustrated by living when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;looking at the &quot;haves&quot; who can afford certain services and luxuries that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they cannot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I am curious to know what the list members think will be the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;differences between the &quot;haves and the have-nots&quot; a half-century from now?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well if our extropian hopes and dreams come to pass and access to strong AI 
<BR>
and self-rep nano is widely available by then, the only real poverty will be 
<BR>
self-imposed by ascetics and religious, technophobe and/or conscientious 
<BR>
vow-of-poverty or rugged outdoor/adventure types.
<BR>
<P>As for the rest of us, being a &quot;have-not&quot; will consist primarily (if not 
<BR>
exclusively) of being deprived of those few things which cannot be 
<BR>
manufactured by a nano-enabled near anything box.  Such as prime Earth real 
<BR>
estate and human-provided services.  While everyone will be able to get 
<BR>
robotic massage and AI psychotherapy, only the truly rich will be able to 
<BR>
afford to have these services performed by real live, well-trained humans.
<BR>
<P>We will all probably be able to live in finely appointed high-rise 
<BR>
condominiums (perhaps out in the oceans), but you will still have to be a 
<BR>
big time mover and shaker to have a villa in the south of France.
<BR>
<P>Or at least that's what I think.
<BR>

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
