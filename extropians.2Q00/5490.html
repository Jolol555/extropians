I don't mean to say that the eocnomy of the U.S. is like Mussolini's Italian
<BR>
economy, only that it shares certain characteristics.  I can see now that it
<BR>
was not a useful comparison, and I'll probably never use it again.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;The element that the U.S. economy has in common with the Italian economy
<BR>
under Mussolini is this:  legal title to capital assets is (in many cases,
<BR>
though not in all cases) held by private individuals rather than by a
<BR>
government.  Sometimes such individual ownership is indirect, such as where
<BR>
a parent corporation owns subsidiary corporations--but if you trace
<BR>
ownership all the way back through the parent corp. you find that the owner
<BR>
is an individual person rather than a government.  However, even though
<BR>
legal title to capital assets is directly or indirectly held by an
<BR>
individual, one branch or another of the government actually controls many
<BR>
of the functions of the corporation.
<BR>
<P>I gave an example in an earlier post of a manufacturer of fasteners used in
<BR>
the construction of nuclear power plants--let me elaborate a bit: title to
<BR>
the business is held by, say, five shareholders.  One or more of them might
<BR>
manage the business, or they might hire someone else to do it.  The person
<BR>
who manages the business must follow federal guidelines for how the
<BR>
machinery is set up, what sort of contracts the corp. can enter into with
<BR>
employees, what sort of restroom the building must have, what sort of
<BR>
entryway the building must have, how quality control of the product must be
<BR>
done, how and for what causes employees can be fired, how to determine which
<BR>
employees to hire, how much to pay low-skilled employees, how to structure
<BR>
fringe benefits for employees, where raw materials can be obtained, and I
<BR>
feel certain there are more that I've left out.  This is NOT what I would
<BR>
call a free-market economy, which is why I said it seemed to be a mixture of
<BR>
capitalism and fascism.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mercantilism and capitalism, as the U.S. economy is a mixture of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capitalism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and socialism and fascism. None of these terms seems to have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very precise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meaning.  In both of these countries there's an active
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;underground&quot; economy.

<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bonnie,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Having read most of Fredrick Von Hayek's book THE ROAD TO SERFDOM I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe there is a fairly accurate definition of Fascism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     As I recall Mussolini was a communist party worker in Italy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Italian veterans came home.  He wanted the communist party to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; represent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the views of these veterans as he felt there would be a political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to doing so.  He was turned down by the communist party but felt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very deeply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he was right.  He renamed himself a fascist and proceeded to gain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power.  So far as I know Mussolini changed his label, changed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some details of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his program but never changed his core beliefs from communism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     With this mind I have to ask; in what way does the economy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the U. S.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; follow the tenents of Fascism?
