Saw this on another list, thought y'all'd get a kick out of it. Hopefully
<BR>
everyone here knows who Dr. Laura Schlesinger is, and that she's come under hot
<BR>
water for publicly stating that homosexuality is deviant behavior:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Dear Dr. Laura,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's law. I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge with as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to best follow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claim the odor is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in Exodus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; her?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lev. 25:44 states that I may buy slaves from the nations that are around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Canadians. Can you clarify?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him myself?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abomination (Lev. 10:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't agree. Can you settle this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lev. 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unchanging.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Carry The Fire,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Buck
</EM><BR>
