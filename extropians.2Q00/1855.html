<EM>&gt; This appears to be a Reuters news release for May 14th!
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; from:
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; The Fed meets on *Teusday, May 16th*. 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ============
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Saturday April 29, 6:14 am Eastern Time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UK Stocks Outlook-Market braces for U.S. rate vote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By David Holmes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; LONDON, May 14 (Reuters) - It was ever thus.
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Yet Friday's stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data brought those fears
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sharply to the fore, contradicting benign data earlier in the week and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heightening the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prospect that Tuesday's Fed meeting will have to consider a rate move.
</EM><BR>
<P>Two pieces of information are here that can influence a trader's decision-
<BR>
the &quot;benign data earlier in the week&quot;, and the &quot;stronger-than-expected US
<BR>
inflation&quot;,
<BR>
which of course is a HUGE advantage to have ahead of time.
<BR>
<P>Maybe Holmes wrote four different versions just in case?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yet even before Friday's strong U.S. inflation figures, the record-breaking run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enjoyed by the FTSE 100 in the early months of the year seemed to have run into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sand.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since the end of March, the leading FTSE 100 index has spiked to a record high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of 6,663.8, but has mostly traded in a range broadly between 6,300 and 6,600 in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that time.
</EM><BR>
<P>So the FTSE would have to stay within this range for the next two weeks-
<BR>
&quot;mostly&quot;?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Analysts on Friday warned it was hard to see what fresh positive events would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the power to move the UK market on to fresh highs, with the FTSE 100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expensive on a near-record high multiple of around 28 times earnings.
</EM><BR>
<P>What analysts?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Betting on the direction of such stocks therefore depends crucially on how Wall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Street reacts to the Fed's decision next week.
</EM><BR>
<P>It also depends crucially on having information ahead of anyone else.
<BR>
I am of course not accusing the Fed of being unusually corrupt here.
