<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Mike I think you were too hard on Zero, tho.  I know that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; he did publish his first and last name on the list last time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we went thru this particular memefest, actually I think he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; did so at least twice before.   {8-]  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The last time we went at this, I gave my full name and info as above. He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;said his first name was Michael, but did not indicate that Powers was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;his real last name, nor did he, or has he now, matched my openness with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a similar level of information. That reluctance to reciprocate indicates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that he does not pratice what he preaches. He IS a hypocrite. I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;calling him on this. Hypocrisy IS a cardinal sin of the rules of debate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Walk the walk if you are gonna talk the talk.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I had said &quot;hey, everybody on this list, I think we should all post our 
<BR>
names, addresses and phone numbers.  You all go first, then I'll do so 
<BR>
also.&quot;  And then if I refused to do so, *that* would be hypocritical.  But 
<BR>
that is not even close to what I have said.
<BR>
<P>What I *have* said is that I think a transparent society will eventually 
<BR>
become necessary, and moreover, I think it will be a good thing.  My refusal 
<BR>
to give *you* my personal information does not contradict anything I have 
<BR>
said.  You and I exchanging personal information over the internet does 
<BR>
*not* a transparent society make.  It is simply a couple of idiots exposing 
<BR>
themselves in public.  Your &quot;walk the walk, talk the talk&quot; nonsense is 
<BR>
clearly just a &quot;dummy's dare&quot; to expose myself as you have done, and I 
<BR>
simply decline that invitation.  That does not make me a hypocrite, a coward 
<BR>
or a fascist.
