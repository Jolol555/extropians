<P><EM>&gt; On the same line of reasoning -- and I think I've posted a message about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this before --, I'm still to ear a good explanation to the animal cloning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiments on the basis of the DNA damage theory of aging (I actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asked a few scientists working on the subject last month in Spa's Congress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I didn't get any attractive answer).
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe it is the reason so many hundreds of attempts are needed before
<BR>
a success.  You have to get lucky to find a cell without too much damage.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As for mitotic misregulation as the basis of aging, that's a speculatory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conclusion. You can always argue that some upstream mechanism is regulating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the genetic machinery and creating the mitotic imbalances.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, every few months someone notices that old cells are worse in terms
<BR>
of characteristic X than young cells, and immediately proposes this as
<BR>
a basis for aging.  Correlation is not causation.
