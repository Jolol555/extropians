<EM>&gt; Y'know, you sound awfully like Leonid Brezhnev at times, Michael.

<EM>&gt; Yes, I agree they need to re-engineer their society. But don't you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's kind of un-libertarian to insist that po' folks stay where they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are and don't come and annoy us rich peeps by trying to take all our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minimum-wage jobs, in the name of bettering themselves?

<P>I don't mind SOME immigration. As you apparently ignored, my previous
<BR>
assertion was that I am for MANAGED immigration. I wouldn't want to
<BR>
admit every serial rapist, murderer, thief, and mental patient that
<BR>
other countries wanted to get rid of... as I said, immigration, while at
<BR>
the individual level may be all about gaining political or economic
<BR>
freedoms, at the societal level its all about one society externalizing
<BR>
the costs of its wasteful social policies/memes onto societies that are
<BR>
more efficient, who put quality over quantity. I have no qualms about
<BR>
opening up free immigration with countries that share our values. For
<BR>
the rest, there should be managed immigration to winnow out the chaff
<BR>
from best workers, best educated, etc. Its OUR country, we have a right
<BR>
to choose who we want to associate with as fellow citizens. If other
<BR>
nations want open immigration with us, then they need to adapt their
<BR>
economies and reproductive policies to be more in line with ours.
<BR>
<P>And how is that very 'Leonid Breshnev' of me? He tried to keep people
<BR>
IN. While there is a case to be made for granting asylum to refugees of
<BR>
political repression, most illegal immigrants to the US live under no
<BR>
repression, they come here for economic reasons. They come here because
<BR>
the failed policies of their home countries have caused over population
<BR>
and inefficient use of resources. Mexico, for example, is the only
<BR>
country in the world that cannot, as hard as it tries, to actually make
<BR>
a profit in the oil industry. So long as we make it easy for people to
<BR>
immigrate here to the US, little or no change will come to Mexico. You
<BR>
will notice that the most recent changes there have happened since we
<BR>
started getting tough on immigration....

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Vermont has the lowest homicide rates in the country, and the most liberal gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; laws
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When losing an argument, change the subject -- fast. It's a great way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not having to face up to uncomfortable facts, isn't it?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, merely a parallel situation. When you can't respond to such points,
<BR>
its easy to claim that the subject is being changed, especially when you
<BR>
selectively edit the post like that.
