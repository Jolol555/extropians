<EM>&gt;&gt; The basic problem that I see is that there is no real competition in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the i86 operating system market.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True, but let's remember the whole situation. There are several non-i86
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platforms that could suddenly become viable if either Intel or Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stumble badly enough, and several OSs (notable Linux) that run just fine on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the i86. So, Microsoft's position is not equivalent to being, say, the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diamond mine in the world. There are lots of potential competitors out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there, and MS's market share depends on its ability to fend them off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successfully.
</EM><BR>
<P>We'll see, I guess. Five years ago I don't think I ever would have
<BR>
believed that Linux could become as mainstream as it's becoming now.
<BR>
It's still a tiny slice of the market, and I don't believe it's a
<BR>
practical option for the typical desktop user, but maybe in a few
<BR>
years it'll get there. We'll have to see what happens with application
<BR>
support.
<BR>
<P>I met a guy a while back who was involved with a start-up to make
<BR>
Window's device drivers work on Linux - device driver availability and
<BR>
quality being one the major impediments to alternative OS platforms.
<BR>
The idea was to put a wrapper around the binary driver interface and
<BR>
try to emulate the, typically pretty lightweight, services required by
<BR>
low level interface logic. They got drowned in letters from Microsoft
<BR>
lawyers claiming that the interface was Microsoft intellectual
<BR>
property and building software based on it constituted a violation of
<BR>
copyright and the Windows license agreement. Whether the claim would
<BR>
stand up didn't matter - the threat was enough for the VC to back out
<BR>
and so it never happened. That's the sort of thing that really underlies
<BR>
my desire to see someone bigger step in, I think. It's just so
<BR>
incredibly, unnecessarily nasty - there are legitimate reasons for
<BR>
copyright law, but the legal excuse to quash something genuinely
<BR>
innovative and useful isn't one of them. I suppose it's the desire to
<BR>
see a parent figure step in and make them play nicely. The market is a
<BR>
jungle - it's survival of the fittest and I freely acknowledge that -
<BR>
but there comes a point when you have to ask what sort of world you
<BR>
want to live in and whether there might be some cause to ask people to
<BR>
treat each other in a more civilized way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Now, obviously I think monopolization is a bad thing - so you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; insert all those standard arguments here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are using 'monopoly' in a different sense than I do. Having a 90% market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; share (or even 100%) doesn't make you a monopoly. A monopoly is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organization that can charge its customers above-market prices for its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; products, or somehow coerce them into buying products they do not wish to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purchase, without fear of loosing ground to competitors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By that standard MS as a whole doesn't qualify, because there are no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; barriers around its markets that prevent competitors from emerging.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I've pointed out that I think application support is the major
<BR>
issue. I ran OS/2 from the early 90's till I finally threw in the
<BR>
towel a couple of years ago. I thought then, and still do now, that it
<BR>
was a better, cleaner, more innovative platform than anything offered
<BR>
by MS. But eventually I got sick of fighting with the Windows
<BR>
emulation every time I wanted to run something, tech support people
<BR>
who wanted to know if my OS/2 was the Win 3.1 version or the Win 95
<BR>
version, and trying to parse badly mangled Word documents via Ami Pro.
<BR>
Now, I don't really want to open the 'why OS/2 died' can of worms - it
<BR>
was bungled by IBM from the beginning - but unless you've been in love
<BR>
with an unsupported platform I don't think you can appreciate the
<BR>
frustration.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; What it really comes down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to, I think, is that control of the PC platform is too important to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; trust to a single corporation: there's too much potential for abuse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; and we loose the advantages of distributed economic optimization. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; is an abstract compliant, not one specific to Microsoft. Perhaps you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; don't object to monopolization as strongly as I do, either because you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; think it's unstable or because it's a lesser evil than government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; interference.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, for both of those reasons. I thing people who favor anti-trust tend to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forget that what they are advocating is a law that requires the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to seek out the most successful businesses in any given market and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confiscate their property for the benefit of their competitors. That harms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the customers, by preventing them from buying the products they wanted.
</EM><BR>
<P>I really think confiscation of property should be the absolute last
<BR>
resort of any resolution - as much as I feel intervention is
<BR>
warranted, I think it should be as minimal and as undisruptive as
<BR>
possible. I'm a bit of a crackpot, but I'm not so wacky I think people
<BR>
should be prevented from buying Windows if they want it or it should
<BR>
be forcibly placed into the public domain. The idea of forcing
<BR>
Microsoft to license the sources at some 'fair' price - whatever the
<BR>
hell that might be - appeals to me. That way other vendors could take
<BR>
a shot at putting out their own version, so we could see competition
<BR>
in the Windows implementation market. (Does that make me a Commie
<BR>
Statist?)
<BR>
<P>More general constraints seem reasonable too - like restrictions on
<BR>
pre-announcement, requiring disclosure of platform changes to
<BR>
competing application vendors to place them on a level field with MS.
<BR>
Basic stuff like that doesn't seem overly onerous to me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Personally, I think this is a stasist way of looking at things. No one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'controls' a free market. Every purchase is voluntary. The only way a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; company can succeed in the long run is by giving customers what they want -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the 'long run' in the PC business is only a couple of years, so the idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of waiting for market forces to work things out is not a big problem for me.
</EM><BR>
<P>We'd be going round in circles if I went into that again. I appreciate
<BR>
the point but I don't share your perspective.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; There will never, without government intervention, be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; implementation of Windows offered by anyone other than Microsoft. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; API is too big and the target is moving too fast. Consider the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; failings of Win-OS/2, and the Wine project.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Isn't this an argument against intervention? The two justifications for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-trust law are to encourage innovation and to keep prices low. If your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statement is true, that knocks out the first justification. The fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; low prices are a primary complaint of MS's competitors seems to knock out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the second as well. That leaves only a general distrust of companies with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large market share - and if you let the government confiscate private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property on mere suspicion of possible future wrongdoing, no one will ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be safe.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is very convoluted.  I'm not sure I follow it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; So, then, what is are appropriate remedies? I'd like to see, as I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; suggested before, a prohibition against government itself purchasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; software based on non-open standards.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, the government can certainly make any rules it likes for its internal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purchasing. It does have one side effect you've missed, which is that it in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect forbids the government from ever buying from a dominant vendor. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the computer industry the general pattern is for dominant players in any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given market to define their proprietary standards, which then become de
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; facto industry standards if they are any good (ODBC is a good example of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this). The minor players then band together to create an 'open' standards to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compete - they make it open because they have to in order to pool enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market share to make their efforts matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, requiring the government to always side with the underdogs probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't really hurt anything, but will tend to lead to higher costs and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frequent vendor turnover than making a informed decisions on a case-by-case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basis. Of course, the government isn't very good at informed decision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making, so they may not be loosing much.
</EM><BR>
<P>It doesn't prevent purchasing from the dominant vendor - they can buy
<BR>
an Ada compiler because Ada is a public standard, whether the
<BR>
particular vendor they're buying from is an underdog is neither here
<BR>
nor there. If there's sufficient market pressure major players will
<BR>
implement the standard - witness the Posix subsystem in NT. (Not, I
<BR>
imagine, that anyone has ever used it...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I'd like to see a market where I don't buy an 'operating system,' I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; buy a memory manager, a tasking subsystem, a file system, a desktop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; environment, etc, from independent vendors - and they all work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; together because they all conform to open standards; in the same way I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; can purchase a nut and a bolt from two different manufactures because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; they come in standard sizes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Everyone wants software to be modular and reusable, but there isn't much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agreement on how to achieve this goal. Is there some particular action you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think the government could take that would yield this result?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know, really. I'm just pontificating about the way I'd like
<BR>
the world to be. In the Linux world, you get a X-Server, a kernel, a C
<BR>
library, a desktop environment from different people. It's nice - you
<BR>
cross-pollinate - and I don't think that the average user in the
<BR>
Windows world understands the number of different, casually related,
<BR>
pieces that make up the 'Operating System.' I have a very traditional
<BR>
view of what an operating system is - basically a glorified device
<BR>
driver who's sole reason for existing is to place a thin abstraction
<BR>
between the hardware and user-mode software. The idea that a web
<BR>
browser can be considered part of 'the operating system' is insane -
<BR>
it's crazy talk. A command line shell isn't part of the OS - it's
<BR>
just a piece of user software that makes system calls. In that view,
<BR>
only a very small part of what Microsoft call Windows is an operating
<BR>
system - the rest is environment and tools. But all that debate is
<BR>
metaphysical, really, and of course these definitions evolve over
<BR>
time. If you can call IE part of the OS though, then why not Office or
<BR>
whatever the hell else they want to cram in there?
