<P><EM>&gt;On a slightly lighter note, I have noticed how kids dont

<EM>&gt;drag race anymore.  Mike, I am a few years older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than you, so I recall drag real racing.  {8-]  Since kids
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dont drag, people now make a habit of running red lights,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a habit that never presented itself back in the days when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;running a red light *could* result in being T-boned by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;two roaring hotrods.
</EM><BR>
<P>Around here (Chicago) they sure haven't stopped! The big difference is that 
<BR>
the racers today don't have classic hotrods modified for racing. They are 
<BR>
more likely to be nailing the throttle in Mommy's Voyager or BMW.
<BR>
<P>The red light here is ignored by as many as five drivers in a line now. Per 
<BR>
lane. Traffic sometimes takes almost ten seconds to peter out before the 
<BR>
opposing direction can start.
<BR>
<P>The hot thing around here now is aggressive tailgating and weaving. The 
<BR>
expressways during medium traffic are worst. I am surprised that I have not 
<BR>
seen more fatal accidents - a testimony to the reaction times of most 
<BR>
drivers, I guess.
<BR>
<P>Three intersections locally now have what appears to be cameras mounted 
<BR>
above each center lane signal. There has been no public announcement as to 
<BR>
these being for surveillance, and from the angle they are mounted at, it 
<BR>
looks like they would have a hard time capturing driver's images and 
<BR>
license plates. Perhaps an image processing traffic light controller?
