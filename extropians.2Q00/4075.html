<EM>&gt; &gt; We each need to figure out how much information freedom we are

<EM>&gt; &gt; that all information should be freeeee, so to them I say fine: freeeee
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; your own first.  I have been toying with this notion myself, to go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ahead and open my own hard disks for anyone who cares to see,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; including financial records, tax records, medical, driving, scholastic,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; employment, everything and anything.  If I did that, then I would be

<EM>&gt; &gt; perfectly comfortable downloading free stuff.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Seems like if they offered some free software and you took the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; action to download it, whatever it wants to do is fair game.  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I will disagree with you on that, although you are perhaps being sarcastic.  What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this kind of software is commonly called is a Trojan, referring to the Trojan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Horse, in that it purports to be some kind of program when it has in fact a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different, unadvertised, function that its users would normally not want and which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be damaging to them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but is it unadvertised? I'll bet there are clauses in the user agreement that
<BR>
specifically grant RealNetworks the right to do this. If its not, I'd rather see a
<BR>
class action than legislation. Laws should be passed only when civil litigation fails
<BR>
to redress a wrong.
