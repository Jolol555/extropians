<P><EM>    &gt;this is what happened in the 30's. There was significant deflation, partly due
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;to a tighttened money supply,
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;and partly due to overproduction by farmers and manufacturers that only
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;knew one thing: producing.
</EM><BR>
<P>The idea that the poverty of the 30's was because people got too good at growing
<BR>
food that people could eat and too good at manufacturing products that people
<BR>
could use is just too silly to debate.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; [if we had cheap fusion power] All except for the millions of people who work in
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the energy recovery, distribution, and generation industries. They'd all be out of work.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, they'd just be out of the oil business.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Since their industries make up some thing like 25% of our economy, at least, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;you are talking about a major contraction,
</EM><BR>
<P>No, because now the nuclear fusion industry would make up 40% of a vastly
<BR>
larger economy.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;making a whole economy obsolete overnight, or almost  overnight will cause
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;a) people to not invest in anything, because they can't be sure if it will be viable
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;or dead 6 months down the road,
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, there is a chance every cent of your investment could be lost, but that never
<BR>
stopped anyone before so I don't see why it would do so now, because there is also
<BR>
a chance your investment could make you filthy rich. 10 years ago when somebody
<BR>
invested in a tiny company called CISCO I'm sure the thought crossed their mind that
<BR>
they might never see that money again, they took the chance anyway and today are
<BR>
very glad they did
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;If you magically introduced one of these aircars for a price of about $20,000
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; today, with a production capacity of a million units a year, GM, Ford, Toyota, Daimler
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; Chrysler, et al would all be declaring bankruptcy in short order
</EM><BR>
<P>Good! A company stupid enough to be ignorant of advances in its own industry and
<BR>
ignores such a historic opportunity should go bankrupt; they're just too dumb to live.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;and you'd have millions of unionized autoworkers out on the streets unemployed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then who is making all those aircars?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Are you starting to see what I am getting at?
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope.
