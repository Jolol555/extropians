<P><P><P>Do quantum computers make us what we are, asks Mark Buchanan 
<BR>
<P><P>YOUR BODY is teeming with quantum computers. Marching along your DNA and 
<BR>
floating around your cells, several hundred million of these minuscule 
<BR>
devices are rearranging your molecules in super-efficient quantum fashion. 
<BR>
<P>So, at any rate, says Apoorva Patel, a physicist at the Indian Institute of 
<BR>
Science in Bangalore. According to Patel, these weird machines are essential 
<BR>
to life. Every living thing from the greatest whale to the lowliest bacterium 
<BR>
depends on an army of quantum computers to copy its DNA and put together its 
<BR>
proteins. 
<BR>
<P>To many biologists this seems like a bad joke. Received wisdom is that 
<BR>
quantum physics, aside from a few minor details, has nothing to do with 
<BR>
biology. Sure, it underlies the chemistry of all molecules, including 
<BR>
biological ones, but the quantum weirdness is kept well out of sight. 
<BR>
<P>Even physicists have reason to be scornful. For 15 years, they have struggled 
<BR>
to build a quantum computer, a device that could exploit the peculiar 
<BR>
properties of the quantum world to do calculations with a style and speed to 
<BR>
put any ordinary computer to shame. Physicists generally concede that the 
<BR>
task is so formidable that a practical quantum computer won't exist for 
<BR>
decades. 
<BR>
<P>So Patel's proposal, which he unveiled in an electronic preprint in February 
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0002037">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0002037</A>), is a radical one by anyone's 
<BR>
standards. The forces of evolution, he claims, may have solved the problem of 
<BR>
quantum computing several billion years ago. It's a startling idea--but if 
<BR>
true, it could explain a puzzle at the core of biology. 
<BR>
<P>Biologists have known for half a century that the sequence of bases along 
<BR>
each strand of DNA encodes biological recipes for making proteins. Each base 
<BR>
is one of four possible kinds--cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) and 
<BR>
thymine (T). So there is a fundamental difference between the four-letter 
<BR>
code of DNA and the strings of 0s and 1s in any computer, where there are 
<BR>
only two alternatives. This is where the mystery begins: why four rather than 
<BR>
just two? 
<BR>
<P>A binary code ought to be better. Modern computers use only two characters so 
<BR>
they can store information using very simple components. To store a 0 or 1, 
<BR>
the transistors inside a microchip only need two states, &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;. More 
<BR>
characters in the code would demand more complicated and costly devices. 
<BR>
<P>Binary logic also cuts down on mistakes. Imagine walking to a distant hilltop 
<BR>
and then trying to transmit a message back to a friend. You might carry 26 
<BR>
flags, one for each letter, and try to spell out messages that way. But on a 
<BR>
breezy day an E might look like an F, and a P like an R. You'd be better off 
<BR>
using just two flags, one black, one white, and expressing letters as strings 
<BR>
of the two. Then your friend would face nothing but simple black-white 
<BR>
decisions, and you could be more confident in your communications. When it 
<BR>
comes to handling information, computer scientists agree that binary is best. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
So why doesn't biology use it? Several billion years ago, when the first 
<BR>
self-replicating molecules were evolving, this simplest of all codes ought to 
<BR>
have been the first to arise, and should have defeated other, more 
<BR>
error-prone codes in the evolutionary race. Or might there be something 
<BR>
mysteriously efficient about the number 4? 
<BR>
<P>Patel thinks there is. To see why, we need to think in terms of computation. 
<BR>
&quot;Computation is nothing but the processing of information,&quot; he says, &quot;so we 
<BR>
can study what DNA does from the viewpoint of computer science.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>A biological computation happens every time a cell divides: the data stored 
<BR>
in one set of DNA molecules gets copied into another set. In a stretch of 
<BR>
double-stranded DNA, bonds link the bases along one strand to those on the 
<BR>
other, with every C bound to a complementary G, and every A to a T. Just 
<BR>
before cell division, enzymes unzip the strands, exposing the bases to the 
<BR>
cell's internal soup of raw materials. Another enzyme known as a DNA 
<BR>
polymerase then marches along each of the two strands, triggering each base 
<BR>
to pair up with a complementary base from the soup. Step by step, the 
<BR>
polymerase copies the genetic information and creates two new double-stranded 
<BR>
DNA molecules identical to the original. 
<BR>
<P>But there's more to this than the simple copying of data. As Patel sees it, 
<BR>
the soup of bases is like a disorganised database containing four kinds of 
<BR>
entry. The polymerase's task is to find an entry of one particular kind. As 
<BR>
the polymerase repeatedly searches for the right base in the alphabet soup, 
<BR>
it is doing computations. And here lies the nub of Patel's idea: we would 
<BR>
expect the polymerase to search in the best way possible. So what is the best 
<BR>
of all possible ways to search a database? 
<BR>
<P>In conventional computing, the best you can do is trial and error. To search 
<BR>
for one kind of object in a jumble of N different kinds, you try one after 
<BR>
another until you get lucky. This way you will find the right thing after an 
<BR>
average of N attempts. For instance, it takes four tries on average to find a 
<BR>
heart by cutting a shuffled pack of cards. This is just like the soup of 
<BR>
bases, which would get shuffled by thermal motions after each attempt. 
<BR>
<P>So molecular biologists assume that DNA polymerase works in the same way. 
<BR>
Every so often, a base of some random kind wanders past the polymerase. It 
<BR>
becomes attached to the growing chain if it happens to be the correct base, 
<BR>
and wanders off again if it isn't. In that case, a polymerase would need to 
<BR>
test an average of four bases before finding the right one. Normally, this is 
<BR>
the best that can possibly be done. But, says Patel, it is possible to do 
<BR>
better by exploiting one of the weirder consequences of quantum mechanics. 
<BR>
<P>In an ordinary computer, a transistor can be either on or off, so a bit is 
<BR>
always either 1 or 0. An alternative is to exploit quantum physics, and to 
<BR>
store information using single quantum particles such as electrons. One might 
<BR>
store bits in an electron's spin, for example, which can be either &quot;up&quot; or 
<BR>
&quot;down&quot;. The key is that the quantum world also allows other seemingly 
<BR>
nonsensical possibilities: an electron's spin can be neither up nor down, but 
<BR>
in a superposition of both. So a string of electrons can hold not just one 
<BR>
distinct string of 0s and 1s, but every conceivable string all at once. 
<BR>
<P>As a consequence, a computer handling information in quantum fashion could do 
<BR>
parallel processing on an outrageous scale, testing many possibilities at the 
<BR>
same time. In 1997 mathematician Lov Grover of the IBM Research Division 
<BR>
showed that a quantum computer can search a database far faster than any 
<BR>
classical device. It starts with a superposition of all the different items 
<BR>
in a database, and alters this quantum state to amplify the desired item and 
<BR>
make the others fade away. For a huge database, the time savings are huge, 
<BR>
and even for smaller values of N the quantum procedure is faster. 
<BR>
<P>Coincidentally, Patel and Grover were graduate students together at Caltech 
<BR>
in the early 1980s. &quot;We met again last year,&quot; says Grover, &quot;through a mutual 
<BR>
interest in quantum computing.&quot; To Patel, Grover's algorithm suggested an 
<BR>
intriguing question: might biochemistry pull off a quantum computation? 
<BR>
<P>Grover's mathematics gives an exact formula for the number of quantum 
<BR>
attempts, Q, needed to find one specific element in a database of N things. 
<BR>
It turns out that if N = 4, then Q = 1. In other words, a quantum computer 
<BR>
can distinguish between four distinct possibilities with just one attempt. 
<BR>
<P>Of course, it would also take a single quantum step to distinguish between 
<BR>
two possibilities. But with a four-base code, DNA only needs to be half the 
<BR>
length. So biology might have decided to use four bases instead of two so 
<BR>
that replication of the molecule can happen twice as quickly. 
<BR>
<P>For Patel's idea to work, the DNA polymerase would have to be able to 
<BR>
manipulate the biochemical soup around it, watching over the base-pair 
<BR>
bonding process to ensure that it occurs in a coherent, quantum-mechanical 
<BR>
way. Each time the enzyme moves to a new base on the strand of DNA it is 
<BR>
copying, it sets up a quantum superposition of the four bases that lie 
<BR>
somewhere in its vicinity, with one ghostly component corresponding to each. 
<BR>
According to quantum theory, such ghosts act like independent waves that move 
<BR>
towards the exposed base on the DNA strand. 
<BR>
<P>Next, Patel believes, the superposition of the four &quot;incoming&quot; waves starts 
<BR>
to interact with the exposed base. This should alter the four waves in 
<BR>
different ways, he says, making them interfere with one another in such a way 
<BR>
that the ghosts for each incorrect base cancel out, while those for the 
<BR>
correct base reinforce. At this point, the C-G-A-T superposition collapses, 
<BR>
leaving the correct base bound to the DNA chain with a hydrogen bond. In 
<BR>
other words, the enzyme should act like a sort of waveguide, ushering the 
<BR>
component wave for the correct base into its proper resting place, while 
<BR>
rejecting the others--carrying out Grover's quantum search in the process. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The quantum search scheme he shows is very nice,&quot; says Grover, &quot;although a 
<BR>
few of the details are somewhat speculative. If true, it is another instance 
<BR>
where nature first figured out how to do things better than us.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Perhaps the biggest &quot;if&quot; is whether the noisy environment within the cell 
<BR>
would permit all this quantum business. The greatest obstacle to building a 
<BR>
quantum computer in the lab is the need to isolate all its working parts from 
<BR>
external disturbances, as almost any interference will destroy the fragile 
<BR>
quantum dynamics. In all their attempts so far, physicists have tried to do 
<BR>
this by cooling their apparatus down to near absolute zero. At the 
<BR>
temperature inside a living cell, the enzyme and the four bases ought to 
<BR>
suffer an annihilating storm of abuse, which should wipe out any possibility 
<BR>
of quantum behaviour. 
<BR>
<P>So DNA polymerase would somehow have to protect the environment around the 
<BR>
growing DNA strand, permitting the quantum computation to go forward 
<BR>
undisturbed. Patel points out that the configuration of electrons around 
<BR>
atomic nuclei helps to shield some nuclear properties from their environment. 
<BR>
Nuclear spins remain in quantum superpositions for several seconds. He 
<BR>
suggests that something similar happens in biochemistry. 
<BR>
<P>No one knows whether DNA polymerases really have all these properties, and 
<BR>
yet the idea may not be so ludicrous: quantum physics is not as foreign to 
<BR>
biology as one might think. In photosynthesis, biology exploits quantum 
<BR>
possibilities at a scale above that of single molecules. When a photon is 
<BR>
absorbed by a photosynthesising cell, its energy excites an electron into a 
<BR>
delocalised state spread out over tens of molecules. 
<BR>
<P>Patel's proposal is more radical, in that it involves quantum superpositions 
<BR>
of whole molecules. The more massive the object, the less obvious its quantum 
<BR>
nature should be: lightweight electrons flaunt their quantum properties, 
<BR>
while whole molecules are usually more coy. But some researchers have begun 
<BR>
to suspect that all enzymes may depend on a quantum process involving 
<BR>
protons--still 150 times lighter than bases, but 2000 times heavier than 
<BR>
electrons. Last year, biochemist Judith Klinsman and colleagues from the 
<BR>
University of California at Berkeley demonstrated that to speed up crucial 
<BR>
cellular chemical reactions, some bacterial enzymes rely on the tunnelling of 
<BR>
protons--a quantum process that allows a particle to pass through a barrier 
<BR>
even if it hasn't got enough energy to climb over. What's more, they manage 
<BR>
the feat even at room temperature. 
<BR>
<P>Finding out whether DNA polymerases perform even more daring quantum tricks 
<BR>
will require careful experiments. In the meantime, Patel is trying to see 
<BR>
where else the quantum connection leads. Every protein in the human body is a 
<BR>
string made from 20 different kinds of amino acid. Why 20? Here again, Patel 
<BR>
thinks, the signs point to quantum computing. 
<BR>
<P>To set the stage for the making of proteins, a strand of messenger RNA copies 
<BR>
the genetic information from DNA and carries it out to a ribosome, one of the 
<BR>
cell's protein manufacturing plants. The ribosome steps along the messenger 
<BR>
RNA, and to each set of three base pairs attaches a tRNA, a stringy molecule 
<BR>
with three base pairs at one end and an amino acid at the other. Once again, 
<BR>
the ribosome faces a search: to build the right protein, it has to repeatedly 
<BR>
find a tRNA corresponding to just one of the 20 kinds of amino acid in the 
<BR>
soup. 
<BR>
<P>The number 20 would seem to have little connection to anything. Patel points 
<BR>
out, however, that this is just the right number to set up another 
<BR>
super-efficient quantum search: for according to Grover's algorithm, a 
<BR>
three-step quantum search can find an object in a database containing up to 
<BR>
20 kinds of entry. Like the number of bases, then, the number of amino acids 
<BR>
seems to be just right if biology has set things up so that the protein 
<BR>
manufacturing process is, in a quantum sense, as efficient as it can be. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The numbers are certainly very provocative,&quot; says Grover. As Patel puts it, 
<BR>
&quot;This is the first time they have come out of an algorithm that performs the 
<BR>
actual task accomplished by DNA.&quot; But do these numbers really point to 
<BR>
quantum computers at the heart of life? 
<BR>
<P>Evolutionary biologists are not convinced. &quot;This field is rife with premature 
<BR>
speculation,&quot; says Laurence Hurst of the University of Bath. &quot;The history of 
<BR>
the 20 amino acids problem has seen some of the most ingenious explanations, 
<BR>
which at first looked even better than this one.&quot; They were all shot down in 
<BR>
flames, he adds, when the biochemistry of the code was finally unravelled. 
<BR>
With regard to the number of amino acids, Hurst points to one specific issue 
<BR>
that Patel concedes is rather troubling: that the correspondence between 
<BR>
tRNAs and amino acids isn't one-to-one. &quot;There may be 20 amino acids,&quot; says 
<BR>
Hurst, &quot;but the same amino acid can get put onto different tRNAs, and the 
<BR>
tRNA does the interacting. So it seems to me that there are more than 20 
<BR>
types to be found.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Even if Patel's idea won't stretch this far, it may still explain why there 
<BR>
are four bases in the basic structure of DNA. &quot;Apoorva generates a lot of 
<BR>
ideas,&quot; says Grover, &quot;and I think irrespective of how the biological and 
<BR>
chemical aspects turn out, this one will make an impact.&quot; And after all, why 
<BR>
wouldn't evolution exploit any quantum avenues open to it? If the cell spurns 
<BR>
quantum tricks, wouldn't that need some explaining of its own? 
<BR>
