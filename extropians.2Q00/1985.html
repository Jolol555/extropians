<EM>&gt; No, they are not. The electrodes are in contact with the primer at all times,

<EM>&gt; and the only thing that occurs at the point of trigger pull is the current flow

<EM>&gt; and spark. This takes much less time than the time it takes for a firing pin to

<P><P>Some target pistols have electro-mechanical trigger systems.  The electric
<BR>
switch triggers can be made much nicer than anything possible mechanical,
<BR>
but for pistols that are required to shoot conventional ammo the hybrid
<BR>
designs work pretty well.  Unfortunately, the lock time and similar are
<BR>
longer since, in addition to the conventional mechanical firing pin and
<BR>
associated delays, an electronic relay adds another delay, increasing the
<BR>
delta time to a value greater than you would expect for either a purely
<BR>
electronic or purely mechanical system.
<BR>
<P>The batteries last a really long time on hybrid systems in my experience,
<BR>
and short of having one sit unused for years on end, I wouldn't worry
<BR>
about it too much (though for self-defense this *is* an issue).  The
<BR>
biggest issue is lock time (due to negative design synergy), but this is
<BR>
only an issue for target shooters.  
<BR>
<P>That said, you still can't beat a purely mechanical design for rugged
<BR>
reliability and simplicity IMO.  If the companies want to most gun owners
<BR>
to buy guns with electronics, they should find a way for the electronics
<BR>
to add value to the capabilities of existing firearms.  Most competent
<BR>
gun owners that I know do not find much value added in the electronics
<BR>
the government wants to add today; they very arguably do not make guns any
<BR>
safer for people already competent at handling guns and don't add features
<BR>
that most gun owners want.  I think the market will take care of this
<BR>
situation just fine.
