<P>
Michael LaTorra explained:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The Buddhist (and Hindu) belief is that incarnation as a human being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the result of progressive karmic improvement from previous births
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as lesser animals. Regression back to an animal state after having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incarnated as a human being is extremely rare. More common is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reincarnation as a human being at a lower social level (hence, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hindu concept of castes).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is important to understand, however, that what is incarnating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from life to life is NOT a unitary, monadic, indivisible entity. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Buddhist dogma is called &quot;anatta&quot; which translates as &quot;no soul.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rather, as the Buddhists have it, there is an energy that moves from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one bodily lifetime to another in a manner not unlike the physics of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one billiard ball impacting another with the first ball transferring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its momentum to the second ball. The first ball stops &quot;dead&quot; and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second moves on.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Furthermore, this transfer is not limited to a single &quot;target&quot; ball.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Buddhists believe that the energy of a particularly advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual can reincarnate as several simultaneous subsequent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individuals, each of whom embodies a part of the power (energy) of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the incarnational predecessor. So, for example, Jamgon Kongtrul, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tibetan Lama who lived earlier in the 20th century, was believed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have entered into 5 concurrent subsequent reincarnations.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; By Buddhist logic, then, human consciousness could depart one bodily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vehicle and migrate to another suitable vehicle (or vehicles) human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or otherwise.  Therefore, as the Dalai Lama said (see my first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; posting) someone who worked closely with computers might be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reincarnate into one that was sufficiently complex to host his or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; her consciousness.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Questions: How tightly coupled would the components of a computing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system need to be in order to host a human consciousness? Could a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distributed system do it? Could the Internet do it? If so, at what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frequency would thoughts occur in such a host system? If a human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness had migrated to the Net, how would we know?
</EM><BR>
<P>Tightness of coupling doesn't matter if you happen to think that
<BR>
consciousness is information/computation.  Many functionalists have
<BR>
argued that the entire economy, along with a variety of other
<BR>
sufficiently complicated social structures, are already independently
<BR>
conscious.  The net would just be yet another item on the list.
<BR>
<P>This is the only context in which it might matter whether or not the
<BR>
entity is &quot;complex&quot; enough to host consciousness... other definitions
<BR>
of consciousness, generally, don't require complexity (that is, a
<BR>
variety of interconnected parts) in order to get the job done,
<BR>
explaining why, for example, your &quot;soul&quot; could, at least in principle,
<BR>
find its way into an insect, while it's quite clear that the contents
<BR>
of your brain could not.
<BR>
<P>Talking about the frequency of thoughts suggests that one can identify
<BR>
and isolate particular thoughts independent from other thoughts, and
<BR>
count them at a certain rate.  I don't think the brain is like this;
<BR>
this is sort of the wrong question to ask.  Before you can ask &quot;how
<BR>
fast,&quot; you have to decide what you want to call &quot;fast.&quot;  (Problem
<BR>
solving capability?)
<BR>
<P>Finally, the epistemological question is especially troublesome.  How
<BR>
would we know if you had reincarnated one-to-one into a baby?
<BR>
Psychoanalytic uncovery of past lives isn't exactly an empirical
<BR>
science these days.  Anyway, if the net IS conscious, it seems clear
<BR>
to me that we'll never get it on the couch.  However, there is a great
<BR>
deal of evidence that the net is here to stay for a long, long time,
<BR>
with subnets, etc forming every day.  So, assuming reincarnation works
<BR>
at all, you could always take a wait and see policy: if you find
<BR>
yourself occupying the Internet not long after death, well, it must be
<BR>
possible after all.
