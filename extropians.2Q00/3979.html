Plants will grow without organic matter in the soil.  The organic matter is
<BR>
useful for conserving water in the soil, providing minerals via the action
<BR>
of soil bacteria in breaking down the organic matter into minerals useable
<BR>
by the plants, and insulating the soil against large changes in temperature,
<BR>
but it's not necessary.  Nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus are the
<BR>
highest-volume minerals consumed by the plants during photosynthesis, but
<BR>
other minerals are also necessary.  The exact array of minerals and the
<BR>
quantities needed depend on the species of plant and to some extent on the
<BR>
weather the plant encounters.  All plants need water, although some can get
<BR>
by with very little. Potatoes need a moderate amount of water. Plants also
<BR>
need carbon dioxide during photosynthesis and oxygen during dark periods and
<BR>
also, I believe, during certain light periods, such as during very hot
<BR>
weather when the plant closes its stomata (the pores on the undersides of
<BR>
the leaves, where gas exchange takes place) and ceases photosynthetic
<BR>
activity.

It is about a student project to grow potatoes in (simulated) Martian soil.
<BR>
Is this possible? This is very startling to me. I was under the impression
<BR>
that you need some sort of organic material in the soil to grow any kind of
<BR>
plant, and surely they will need to at least add water.
<BR>
What exactly are the soil requirements for growing various types of plants?
<BR>
Could you grow food plants in the dust which coats the moon? If so, this
<BR>
drastically simplifies my lunar colonization plans.
