<EM>&gt;&gt; Cloning experiments are useful for they contradict in many ways the theory

<EM>&gt;&gt; of DNA accumulating mutations (this particular experiment doesn't do that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; because the cells were &quot;aged&quot; in vitro after being taken from a fetus but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; other experiments do just that, despite the data no being conclusive).

<EM>&gt;I disagree.  With the cloning success rates so low, you have no idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whether the failures are due to scientific methodology or whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you have a situation where only 5% of the cells contain an &quot;intact&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;developmental program.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe -- can't find the reference -- some Asian scientists cloning mice
<BR>
did find a correlation between donor age of the nucleus and the chances of
<BR>
creating a viable clone. However, for DNA mutations to cause aging they must
<BR>
accumulate a great number of mutations per cell, of which a few you would
<BR>
expect to be present in clones visibly affecting their physiology. There
<BR>
are, of course, other arguments: perhaps the DNA was damaged but was correct
<BR>
by the superior power of the egg to repair DNA (the repair of the telomeres
<BR>
in this experiment is a good example of DNA repair); or the fact that in
<BR>
this particular experiment the control clones (with nucleus from cells not
<BR>
aged in vitro) did not show a different success in creating viable calfs.
<BR>
Without being conclusive, I still think clones do harm the DNA mutation
<BR>
theory.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The cloning experiments *may* be saying something very interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about the DNA mutation theory.  The only way I can see to shed some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;light on this will be when we have good DNA polymorphism chips
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that can allow you to measure the &quot;noise&quot; (mutation) level in the genome.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Then you take 2000 cells, split them, measure the effective mutation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;level in each &quot;clone&quot; at the same time you try to make an organism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out of them.  If the mutation rate (genome noise level) is lower
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in those clones that produce successful organisms, then you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have a smoking gun for the DNA mutation accumulation theory.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, of course that if someone does that we'll have some answers.

<EM>&gt;  &quot;In a related experiment, the team cloned five calf fetuses from adult cells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   kept in culture until senescence. They removed the fetuses at 6 weeks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   of gestation so they could compare their cells with those of normal fetal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   calves. The clones' cells divided an average of 93 times compared to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   only 61 for cells from normal calves. If this increased life-span extends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   to the whole animal, Lanes says, there is &quot;a real possibility&quot; that cloned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   animals might live as much as 50% longer than their normal counterparts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   --up to 180 to 200 years in the case of humans--an idea, he says, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &quot;is going to raise an eyebrow or two.&quot;&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's even more direct evidence. I grant you it still doesn't prove the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entire animal will live longer but it does give considerable weight to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that idea; and a increase from 61 to 93 divisions is not small and is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theoretical, it's a concrete experimental result.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mice having shorter telomeres at birth do not live less than controls. There
<BR>
is no correlation between in vitro doubling potential from cells taken
<BR>
post-partum and life span. Therefore it is unlikely that we will witness a
<BR>
50% or close increase in the life span in these animals. I personaly am more
<BR>
interested in seeing the results from Blasco's knock in telomerase mice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    &gt; Ever since Fossil's book, everyone has thought that &quot;aging&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    &gt; associated with telomere shortening and quite simply that is crap.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It sounds like you're saying that there is no possibility telomere shortening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has anything to do with aging, not in any way shape or form. Skepticism is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;always healthy in science but cynicism is not and I don't think the evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can support such an extreme view.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I believe I've said before, telomeres do appear to be related to aging
<BR>
but are hardly the final picture.
<BR>
<P>Best regards.
