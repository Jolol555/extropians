<P>
Joao's thesis is essentially that senescence must be due to a small set of
<BR>
root causes because of the following empirical data:
<BR>
<P>(1) altering one or a few genes can markedly increase maximum lifespan, eg
<BR>
SOD/catalase genes
<BR>
<P>(2) related taxa can differ markedly in maximum lifespan, eg,  Pan &amp; Homo;
<BR>
Rivulus &amp; Cynolebias; Salmo spp.
<BR>
<P>...but the logical fallacy here is plain: just because altering one
<BR>
&quot;controlling&quot; parameter changes another system parameter markedly in one
<BR>
direction; we cannot assume that the system has a tiny set of such
<BR>
&quot;controlling&quot; parameters for that latter system parameter.
<BR>
<P>The empirical data that Joao cites certainly does not rule out his
<BR>
hypothesis but it also does not lend any support whatsoever. It is logically
<BR>
unrelated to his hypotheis.
<BR>
************************
<BR>
On the other hand, the assumption that metazoans are potentially infinite
<BR>
lifespan entities in the absence of a few genetic faults is suspect on
<BR>
biological grounds.
<BR>
<P>The genetic machinery necessary to produce the specialization &amp; coordination
<BR>
found in an advanced metazoan is enormous.
<BR>
<P>Such highly coordinated systems are especially failure-prone because of
<BR>
their complexity. In vivisystems the naturally high-coordination,
<BR>
decentralized &quot;design paradigm&quot; does allows graceful failure of an
<BR>
individual system.
<BR>
<P>But that is all.
<BR>
<P>Robustness and immunity from failure are two quite different things.
<BR>
<P>To evolve a near-eternal organism in this scenario, the fitness of the
<BR>
immortality phenotype would have to be truly enormous. The modifications to
<BR>
the underlying genetics - to yield such a phenotype - would be truly
<BR>
forbidding.

<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;If you have *nothing* but a variety of accumulating late-acting

<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;pathologies, that alone will create &quot;aging&quot;: increasing mortality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;plus decreasing function accumulating thoughout life, following
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;a roughly Gompertzian curve.  So the pathologies can indeeed be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;the basic cause of aging.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;No, the phenotype of aging does not indicate such an origin. I'll tell you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;why: (1) the large differences in aging phenotypes amongst closely-related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;species indicates simple mechanisms (for example, amongst teleosts);
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't get this reference.  Are you talking about lifetime vs. one-time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reproduction in salmon?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;(2) Occam's razor: what's easier to evolve, 100 mutations for age-related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;diseases or 10 mutations upstream of age-related diseases;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Every system and most genes can evolve some kind of age-related problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;All of these problems will thus be in mutation-selection balance with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the &quot;optimal&quot; alleles.  Any metazoan population will necessarily be
</EM><BR>
variable
<BR>
<EM>&gt;for thousands of age-related deleterious alleles.  Alleles which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;combine several systems together are much more difficult to evolve;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the population isn't spewing out thousands per generation.  There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no way to avoid this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;(3) Gompertz'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;curve is not a rough one; in human populations it shows a good correlation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;(see Hayflick's book)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What we see is what's predicted; close to a Gompertz most of the time;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not a Gompertz in youth or old age.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;(4) there is only one age-related dysfunction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;(presbyopia) that affects all humans; so, unless thousands of back-up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;pathologies are constantly at work, your argument does not stand;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There *are* thousands of pathologies.  The phenetic variability of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aging is a problem for *your* theory; you're the one claiming we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all have the same aging system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;(5) despite what I said in (1), in mammals that is not true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You've got to make up your mind here.  If similarity of aging is evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for your theory, variability (1) is evidence against it, and vice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;versa.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Mammals have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;large amount of similarities in the aging process (read Finch's book for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;references). If aging is just the diseases that evolved due to lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;evolutionary pressure in old ages, then larger differences are expected.
</EM><BR>
Yet
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;mice -- with maximum lifespans of 5 years -- have roughly the same
</EM><BR>
diseases
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;we do at age 65. And the best (and simpler, I'm sure you can think of
</EM><BR>
other,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;more complex and therefore more unlikely, explanations) explanation is
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;there is a single mechanism causing aging in mammals that in turn leads to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;all age-related diseases.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No; the simple explanation is that *everything* goes wrong.  Mammals are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all biologically very similar; they have the same things to go wrong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Non-replaceables wear out; proliferation slows, impairing repair,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and cancer becomes more common.  These are all very straightfoward.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Read Bowles J, 2000. He makes a good argument against what you just said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Erk!  Didn't you notice that was in Medical Hypotheses?  It didn't even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rate Mechanisms of Aging and Development.  I can't get the article, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;UC Riverside has never gotten that journal and UC Irvine hasn't gotten it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;since 1991.  But just looking at the abstract shows me several problems:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;B&gt;A new thought experiment with competing strains of algae
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;B&gt;corrects for these issues and shows that aging evolved and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Well, thought experiments aren't adequate. If you want to support demic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;selection, you need to do the population biology or quantitative genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;models, like Goodnight or Wade do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;B&gt;retained so that groups retain enough genetic variability to allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;B&gt;for rapid evolution of a defense to novel predation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is a serious error.  Aging won't preserve genetic variability, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will reduce it.  Neutral variation will be the same.  Near-neutral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;variation will be *less* in the aging population, due to faster turnover.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When a novel situation comes along, the aging population will *more*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;likely have lost the genes to deal with it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;The hypothetical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;antagonistic pleiotropy genes that are beneficial to young while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;detrimental to old individuals, predicted to exist in the 1950s, are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;unlikely to exist, have not, and likely will not be found in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;sufficient quantity to participate in the aging process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;He needs to read the literature: there have been many demonstrations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of antagonistic pleiotropy.  Offhand, I can recall Rose's and Partridge's;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there are many, many others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;He doesn't mention that an aging population will be far less fit just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because it has a higher death rate.  If the situation is dire to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;point a non-aging population can barely make it, the aging population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will have negative growth due to the extra mortality, and will go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extinct.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;P.S. I'm not knocking Medical Hypotheses; there's a role for such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;journals.  It's just that things published there aren't really evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for anything.
