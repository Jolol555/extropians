My understanding is that you have only recently subscribed to this list,
<BR>
mainly because you discovered that a lot of the topics under discussion
<BR>
were interesting for you. I guess about 3 years ago I was in the same
<BR>
situation. I ran across the list after reading an article in Wired
<BR>
magazine, subscribed to it, and really enjoyed the messages. I felt at
<BR>
home here with a lot of other people who were interested in all manner
<BR>
of tech, life extension, self improvement, etc. etc. The idea of extropy,
<BR>
and later on, the singularity, made sense to me- like I already knew it
<BR>
instinctively but never had put all the pieces together or had come up
<BR>
with a word for it.
<BR>
<P>And gradually the optimism has infected me, mirrored by developments in
<BR>
my life, to the point that only now would I be willing to call myself
<BR>
a real extropian/singularitarian. There really is (as best said in The
<BR>
Matrix :-) a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
<BR>
You can be aware of the ideas espoused here, yet live your life in a
<BR>
completely different manner. You can read about skydiving yet never
<BR>
go do it. You can come up with a great idea, yet never take the risks
<BR>
involved with building a business around it.
<BR>
<P>Basically what I am saying is it takes time to really sink in, even
<BR>
if you are familiar with the ideas. It just takes awhile to really
<BR>
reorder your thoughts into this different outlook and commit to living
<BR>
this way. My advice is to keep lurking and digesting what you read.
<BR>
Eventually you either will become disinterested in the list, or you
<BR>
will go in the opposite direction and probably start having some
<BR>
epiphanies as to possible new things you can do. Those things and
<BR>
ideas would be what we all can give you advice on if you like.

<EM>&gt; You would think any real extropian would love to hear ways to increase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their &quot;personal extropy&quot;. Why aren't we having discussions on the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about how to be more extropian? We have sublists such as the investing-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; node where people can discuss strategies, but in general the people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on this list seem remarkably unwilling to publicly discuss or ask for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advice on ways they might improve themselves.
