<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  May 16, 2000
<BR>
<P>STUDENTS TAKE THE LEASH AS FIDO HEADS BACK TO THE DESERT
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several groups of high school students will take the controls
<BR>
of NASA's prototype Mars rover, the Field Integrated Design and
<BR>
Operations (FIDO) rover, this week as part of ongoing field tests
<BR>
designed to simulate robotic driving conditions on the red planet.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This year, we are focusing the rover tests on controlling
<BR>
FIDO as if it were on Mars,&quot; said Dr. Eric Baumgartner, systems
<BR>
engineer for FIDO rover development at NASA's Jet Propulsion
<BR>
Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  &quot;The science and engineering teams 
<BR>
are sequestered in the mission control room at JPL's Planetary
<BR>
Robotics Laboratory while the rover is in a geologically
<BR>
interesting site in an extremely remote portion of central 
<BR>
Nevada.  The teams will only see the site through the eyes of the
<BR>
rover.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the formal engineering tests, two days have been
<BR>
set aside for student participation.  The student groups are
<BR>
located at their schools around the country in Ithaca, N.Y.;
<BR>
Birmingham, Ala.; St. Louis, Mo.; and Flagstaff, Ariz.  In
<BR>
addition, a group of students from Copenhagen, Denmark will be in
<BR>
the JPL mission control room for their portion of the test drive. 
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students will use the same tools as the engineers and will
<BR>
view rover telemetry and develop their own command sequences for
<BR>
communicating with the rover. Each student group is responsible for
<BR>
creating and executing a part of the sequence that controls the
<BR>
rover's return to the vicinity of a simulated lander.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The students have a real role helping us complete a very
<BR>
complicated rover field test. We are providing an exciting venue
<BR>
for motivated high school students to apply verbal, written,
<BR>
mathematical, and computer skills to solve real problems involving 
<BR>
simulated surface operations,&quot; said Dr. Raymond Arvidson, a
<BR>
geologist from Washington University, St. Louis, and mission
<BR>
director for the field tests.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIDO is about the size of a St. Bernard. It weighs about 70
<BR>
kilograms (150 pounds) and is approximately 85 centimeters (about
<BR>
33 inches) wide, 105 centimeters (41 inches) long, and 55
<BR>
centimeters (22 inches) high.  The rover moves at an average speed 
<BR>
of about 200 meters an hour (about one-tenth of a mile per hour)
<BR>
over smooth terrain, using its onboard stereo vision systems to
<BR>
detect and avoid obstacles &quot;on-the-fly.&quot; During these tests, FIDO
<BR>
is powered both by solar panels that cover the top of the rover 
<BR>
and by replaceable, rechargeable batteries. FIDO is about twice the
<BR>
size of Mars Pathfinder's Sojourner rover and is more capable of
<BR>
performing its job without frequent human help.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FIDO science and engineering teams are exploring the
<BR>
remote field site through the eyes of the rover by collecting
<BR>
black-and-white and color panoramic images, near-infrared spectra,
<BR>
and close-up measurements at the site in an attempt to characterize
<BR>
the area's geology and geologic history. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a portion of the field test, FIDO is being joined by
<BR>
K9, a rover under development at NASA's Ames Research Center,
<BR>
Moffett Field, Calif.  During the joint field operation, K9 will
<BR>
act as a &quot;scout&quot; by moving ahead of FIDO in search of rocks that 
<BR>
are the best candidates for core sampling.  K9 is controlled from
<BR>
JPL using Ames' &quot;Virtual Dashboard,&quot; a graphical user interface
<BR>
that lets the rover operator send commands to K9, which executes
<BR>
them using onboard executive software.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planning of K9's command sequences is supported by a suite
<BR>
of software tools called Viz, developed at Ames by the Autonomy and
<BR>
Robotics Area.  Viz uses images from stereo cameras onboard K9 to
<BR>
create a realistic 3D model of the surrounding environment.  During
<BR>
the trial, this model will be displayed as a virtual reality 
<BR>
environment that allows the scientists and rover operators to
<BR>
travel around the area, measuring distances and object sizes, in
<BR>
order to recommend the best sampling sites and traverse routes.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This field trial is a 'proof of concept' of a successful
<BR>
multi-rover experiment,&quot; said Dr. Nicola Muscettola, Autonomy and
<BR>
Robotics Area Lead at Ames. Like FIDO, K9 is controlled from JPL's
<BR>
mission control center.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FIDO rover is a testbed for future missions, including the
<BR>
proposed Mars Mobile Lander that is currently under study for a
<BR>
possible launch in 2003.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;FIDO's development began in 1998 as a way to integrate and
<BR>
test new robotic technologies for future Mars rover missions,&quot; says
<BR>
Dr. Paul Schenker, who leads the FIDO project at JPL. &quot;A major
<BR>
strength of this work has been its rapid prototyping, 
<BR>
science-driven style.  We've developed a systems-oriented approach
<BR>
with the ability to quickly bring diverse robotics technologies,
<BR>
advanced science instrument designs, and a close knit science and
<BR>
engineering operations team together in realistic field tests. FIDO
<BR>
has become a terrific design tool for advancing NASA's capabilities
<BR>
and reducing risk for  future Mars missions.&quot;

<BR>
Institute of Technology.
