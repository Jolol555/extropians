<EM>&gt; &gt; Every day, billions of animals die in suffering and pain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as their desperate struggles to escape a predator fail.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Nature is screwed up.  It's a bloodthirsty, vicious world.  We should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; able to do better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Predation is not a 'problem'. Its a solution. It weeds out the weak and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ill and aged. It is THE instrument of evolution. Predation IS nature at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work. Predation is most certainly NOT bloodthirsty. Predators do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kill more than they need to, and viciousness is a human sentiment.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would agree with Michael on the semantic issues but I have to agree
<BR>
with Hal on the &quot;moral&quot; issues (realizing of course that &quot;morals&quot;
<BR>
are also a human invention).
<BR>
<P>A &quot;reasonable&quot; moral principle in my book is &quot;Thou shalt not cause
<BR>
pain or suffering, if the pain or suffering is 'reasonably' avoidable.&quot;
<BR>
The structure of nature &quot;currently&quot; does not allow humans to eliminate
<BR>
pain and suffering, but we *could* by growing meaty biofoods and feeding
<BR>
them to carnivores around the world.  Now, Michael will scream that
<BR>
this upsets evolution, to which I can say &quot;simulate it&quot;.  There is
<BR>
no &quot;real&quot; pain or suffering in simulations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Animals are not concerned with being mean, or causing pain and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffering, they are interested in FOOD. The only reason you don't feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same way about herbivores is that plants can't make noise to object
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they are eaten or flee from their consumers, even though studies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have shown that plants object just as much to being damaged or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destroyed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Plants may have a &quot;chemical response&quot; to being eaten by insects or
<BR>
other sources, but that is distinct from pain or suffering in
<BR>
higher animals that require pain sensing neurons and brain
<BR>
systems that receive those signals and create an awareness in
<BR>
the psyche.  The information content of the &quot;pain&quot; response
<BR>
of a plant is much less than the information content of the &quot;pain&quot;
<BR>
response of an animal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Eating plants versus eating animals is ethically no different, both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are harvesting the body of another living thing for one's own sustenance.
</EM><BR>
<P>That depends whether you place a &quot;value&quot; on the information content
<BR>
of the material being consumed.  Animals have a higher sentience
<BR>
quotient (information content) than plants, so consuming an animal
<BR>
destroys more information than consuming a plant.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Its rather hilarious for me to see people who are both vegetarians and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who claim they are environmentalists but express disgust for the laws of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature, they don't see the inconsistency.
</EM><BR>
<P>Michael, I am primarily a vegetarian, not however on the basis of
<BR>
disliking the laws of nature, since I like you view them (currently)
<BR>
as a necessary means to an end.
<BR>
<P>I'm an down-to-the-bones rationalist and simply despise the inefficiency
<BR>
of consuming energy sources derived from carnivores.  After all they
<BR>
require 10x the solar energy per kcal that plants do.  There is nothing
<BR>
in the meat of a carnivore that could not be produced much more efficiently
<BR>
in a solar powered bioreactor (given sufficient programming).  Given
<BR>
(in my book), the ethical concerns over the qualitative difference between
<BR>
the pain and suffering involved in consuming carnivore derived food,
<BR>
herbivore derived food and plants themselves, how can you (rationally)
<BR>
justify consuming the least efficient sources of energy?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I've said before here, when people started talking about having skin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of solar cells to eliminate the need to eat, that I expect when such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people are created that they'll pretty quickly form a PETOP, the People
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the Ethical Treatment Of Plants. They'll call vegetarians inhumane
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; butchers and disgusting bloodthirsty immoral barbarians. But thats only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because they are now thinking like plants....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Not if they are really &quot;rational&quot;.  For with plants the information in
<BR>
the genomes really *is* sufficient.  You don't need any learned behaviors
<BR>
or cultural informaiton.  So rationalists, wishing to maximise the
<BR>
information content available per unit of energy, will argue for the
<BR>
elimination of plants and the production of sentient beings that can
<BR>
directly use the available energy sources.
