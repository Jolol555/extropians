After hearing about asterisked Extropian Martha Stewart, I found that she
<BR>
writes a syndicated column which appears in my local newspaper.  Here are
<BR>
the topics in yesterday's &quot;Ask Martha&quot;:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: How do you make a chain of paper dolls?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha Stewart: With nothing more than scissors, paper and a little
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imagination, you can make intricate paper dolls to use as decorations
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for events such as a bridal shower or birthday party....
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: What is the best way to dry and store fresh pasta, and how long
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will it keep?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha Stewart: The dried pasta we buy in grocery stores has ease
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and convenience going for it, but it can't quite capture the subtle
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flavor of homemade pasta.  Many people see making fresh pasta as a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daunting task, but it's far simpler than it appears - and the taste
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is more than worth the effort....
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q: I have two cats who love to play on our dining room table.  I have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tried everything to keep them off.  Do you have any suggestions?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha Stewart: if there's a piece of furniture we'd rather not see
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our pets on, they will invariably make it their favorite place....
<BR>
<P>Any of these questions would make fine discussion topics for our
<BR>
Extropian list.  We can start with the paper dolls.  What are the
<BR>
implications of nanotech and AI for making paper dolls?  Could there
<BR>
be &quot;smart paper&quot; where you start cutting out the doll at one end, and
<BR>
your cuts are automatically replicated repeatedly down the paper so you
<BR>
don't have to fold it first?  Maybe it could even be possible to &quot;undo&quot;
<BR>
cuts when you made a mistake with the scissors.  As for AI, what new
<BR>
forms of paper dolls could be invented by an intelligence thousands of
<BR>
times greater than our own?  Would they even be comprehensible to us,
<BR>
or would they be as far beyond our efforts as our own paper dolls are
<BR>
beyond those made by ants?
<BR>
<P>This opens up all kinds of new possibilities for Extropian discussions.
<BR>
That asterisk covers a lot of ground.  Who's next, Jerry Springer?
<BR>
I can't wait to find out.
<BR>
<P>Hal
