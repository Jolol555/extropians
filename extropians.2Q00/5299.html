From: &quot;altamira&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:altamira@ecpi.com?Subject=Re:%20Commie%20Nonsense&In-Reply-To=&lt;200006162018.NAA10003@well.com&gt;">altamira@ecpi.com</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Unfortunately in a country with a bad government, a poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;economic system, and high infant mortality having many children
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;may be the only answer to having someone to care for you in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;old age.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Neither &quot;a government&quot; nor &quot;an economic system&quot; is an entity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capable of holding beliefs, making decisions, or acting. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Individual people believe, decide, and act.
</EM><BR>
<P>Governments do determine the economic system. Are you really trying
<BR>
to say governments don't make decisions and act on them?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The poor women I know who have more children than they're able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;take care of certainly didn't get pregnant time after time after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time in order to have someone to take care of them in their old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;age.  Many of them were forced by their husbands to have sex when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they didn't want to(and when they went to the priest to ask for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advice, they were told to go home to their husbands and be good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wives), and were prevented from using contraceptives or getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;abortions by people employed by the Catholic church and various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;governmental entities.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was refering to ethnobiographical data from India/Pakistan. The
<BR>
situation of your Mexican friends appears to be different.
<BR>
<P>People who allow religion into their lives face the consequences.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Excuse me, this is most certainly NOT a definition of Fascism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; You are confusing government corruption and the actions of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; greedy people, with capitalism.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This is the way it was in Germany &amp; Italy in the 1930's and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1940's, and their form of economic/political system was referred
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to as fascist. This is why I defined the term in that way.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;U.S. is going farther down that same road every day.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fascism: a system of government characterized by dictatorship,
<BR>
belligerent nationalism, and racism, militarism, etc: first
<BR>
instituted in Italy.
<BR>
<P>Don't see a fit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; What kind of government you have will determine what kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; economic system you have. Capitalism is an economic system, NOT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; a form of government.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I don't understand what you mean in the above 2 sentences. Could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you clarify, please?
</EM><BR>
<P>The opposite of Communism is not Democracy as I often hear on T.V,
<BR>
the opposite of Communism is Capitalism. The opposite of Democracy
<BR>
is Totalitarianism.
<BR>
<P>There are no totalitarian/capitalist societies, nor any democratic/
<BR>
communist ones either.
