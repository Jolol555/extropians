Yes. With every human comes an Ego and yes, Michio Kaku is no different. Science is not independent of culture because even though a measurement may be independent of 'values', the interpretation of such measurements seem always to be subject, ultimately, to the majoritarian view, within a field of study.

<P>&lt;&lt; Well, considering that some half dozen or so of these units have survived
<BR>
re-entry (every one that did reenter), and a few have even be recovered and
<BR>
reused on other spacecraft, there should be plenty of confidence in our
<BR>
technology. Instead, he pointed at the one incident of a Russian nuclear
<BR>
generator device re-entering in Canada that was not designed with anywhere near
<BR>
the level of relaibility that ours were, and using that incident to tar all use
<BR>
of nuclear power in space, much as our own light water reactors get tarred by
<BR>
people comparing them to Chernobyl, when the Chernobyl technology was a) less
<BR>
reliable and b) intentionally put into near meltdown condition. Kaku knows all of
<BR>
these things, he is more interested in getting media face time to make himself
<BR>
into the Carl Sagan of the 21st century than in scientific objectivity.

<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; Thats primarily my concern. Anyone who calls themselves a scientist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  should have the integrity to acknowledge that a) the chances of it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  hitting earth were infinitesimal, b) if they did hit earth, they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  designed to survive reentry and impact intact without leakage. His tv
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  lobbying over that issue was disgusting and dishonest &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He was dishonest IF he could see beyond his own personal prejudices which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; usually blind a person (all of us) into thinking beyond the current paradigm.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If he really knew better (had confidence in the reentry shielding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering) he might've given thought to changing his mind. Similarly, a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the best scientists had a prejudice in Favor of uranium 235,BWR style
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power plants, before the practical testing and evaluation had been performed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again its a matter of people discovering the truth and deciding what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important.
