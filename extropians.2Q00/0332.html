<EM>&gt; I think this analogy fails because GM doesn't have the same power in the

<EM>&gt; auto market that Microsoft has in the software market. If they did, then

<EM>&gt; I'd probably support some kind of restriction.

and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Property doesn't exist without government stormtroopers. They're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already there - the issue is what we do with them. We invent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ownership rights because they're so useful. If it becomes useful to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impose restrictions on the rights ownership confers, we have every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right to do so. It's a meme, not a divine right.

<P>And here we have the phenomenon that bothers me most about the Microsoft
<BR>
case.  The theories behind current antitrust law are about as thoroughly
<BR>
discredited as anything in economics ever gets.  Natural monopolies may or
<BR>
may not actually be possible, but they are definitely far less common than
<BR>
most people seem to think.  In the MS case the government doesn't even have
<BR>
that excuse - they're reduced to saying &quot;Microsoft is really big, and it
<BR>
plays hardball, so that must mean it has some kind of unfair advantage
<BR>
somehow, and we should stop them&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The problem is that the government's arguments for Microsoft's supposed
<BR>
unfair advantage are an incoherent jumble of discredited theories and naive
<BR>
nonsense.  Microsoft is in the same position as any major company in a
<BR>
competitive field - they look really intimidating until they screw up, and
<BR>
then they fall on their faces just as fast as the little guys.
<BR>
<P>Microsoft got where it is by giving its customers what they wanted.  The
<BR>
instant they cease to do so, someone else will step forward and take away
<BR>
their market.  The actions the government is accusing Microsoft of taking
<BR>
are all perfectly normal business practices, which would not merit a raised
<BR>
eyebrow in any rational legal system. The whole case is simply a matter of
<BR>
companies that don't want to bother competing in the market crying for the
<BR>
government to stamp out competition for them.
