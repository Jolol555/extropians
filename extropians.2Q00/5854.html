Well it is an interesting quandry- if you are convinced that in the near
<BR>
future (less than 50 years) there will be technology available to make
<BR>
you near-immortal (with a copy of yourself on tape just in case :-) then
<BR>
why take any risks at all during the current era? Is it the most rational
<BR>
course of action to find the safest lifestyle and live accordingly?

<EM>&gt; &gt; It seems that your criteria are mainly about avoiding death well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rather than living well. While the above are certainly a big plus for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any location, it would hardly be the central issues if I wanted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; move anywhere. My list of criteria would instead center around the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; density of interesting people, information sources and events in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; vicinity. &quot;Best&quot; is after all a highly subjective thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; YES!  It seems that so many people want to jump from past to future without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; savoring the present.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I love where I live, because it's remote enough to be private (I'm 3 miles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the farm to market road over 4-wheel drive type terrain); the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevailing winds bring clean air either off the Gulf of Mexico, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Chihuahuan desert, or the plains; we're within easy driving distance of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Austin with its university, concerts, restaurants, museums, etc; close to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; San Antonio which still retains so many of the cultural influences of Spain,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mexico, and Germany; get Austin metro telephone service; we're at the top of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the watershed, so we don't get anyone else's trash running downhill; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; land is such that we have a fascinating variety of naturally occurring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hybrid plants; the history and pre history of the area are very interesting;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the people living around me are mostly of an independent frame of mind and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't believe in meddling with other people's business; my immediate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neighbors are all exceptionally nice people; the climate allows me to grow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably 90% of temperate climate plants and, with some protection, many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subtropical plants and with my attached greenhouse, tropicals such as citrus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with very little heat other than solar; and we're only around 90 miles from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Mexican border (to some people this would seem a disadvantage, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consider it a plus).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I took some photos of my place and put them up on my web site, if anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would like to see my version of paradise.  One of the photo's is captioned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;View from north side of Altamira.&quot;  Altamira is the name of my place.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; named it after that cave in Spain with the prehistoric bison paintings.
