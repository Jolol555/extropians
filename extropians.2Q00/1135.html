What if art actually was some sort of abstract
<BR>
science- sort of a way of sending back input from the
<BR>
&quot;world-mind&quot; or whathaveyou... being  like an
<BR>
intelligence, the system keeps changing all the time
<BR>
based on the state of the world...  So Raffaello and
<BR>
Michealangelo were just different parts of the same
<BR>
thing, but since they were at different times and
<BR>
different places, they only gave &quot;their edge&quot; of the
<BR>
map?
<BR>
*shrugs* Well, it's one way of looking at things. 
<BR>
It's sort of forming a picture of just how arbitrary
<BR>
much of our groupings are- probably some function of
<BR>
our hardwiring that makes us automatically see the
<BR>
anthive as one thing but not the city, or in some
<BR>
cases see the fungus and not the fungus-colony... or
<BR>
perhaps the fungus but not the individual strands that
<BR>
make it up.  A lot of things seem to be geared to fit
<BR>
into one perceptual framework, whereas there are many
<BR>
possible settings for such things... one reason why
<BR>
some people may have troubles of various types- like
<BR>
Eleizer with symbol formation, or Aaron Fenander (an
<BR>
autistic friend from school) with working in anything
<BR>
but algebraic transformations- may be that they don't
<BR>
automatically assume many of the things we do- they're
<BR>
not as strongly hardwired in certain directions,
<BR>
allowing them to form arbitrary setups outside of the
<BR>
standard conditions and therefor bring about new
<BR>
concepts- such as memetics.  I remember reading an
<BR>
article by Martin Gardner recently where he proposed
<BR>
other sorts of similar permutations that would
<BR>
function in a like manner but might be denounced as
<BR>
absurd.  The &quot;unglue-ed-ness&quot; of some people's mental
<BR>
functioning might be just what is necessary for
<BR>
accomplishing certain higher order operations on our
<BR>
way towards sigularity:)

<EM>&gt; Art, science: what is the (main) difference?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My opinion is simple.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sciences have some &quot;attractor-like&quot; pattern. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Researchers &quot;discover&quot; exactly the same thing (law,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theorem, ...).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even in very different times, countries, &quot;languages&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; '(i.e. quantum 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mechanics).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's definitely not true, in art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michelangelo is far from Raffaello, etc.. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In art there's not a common language, world,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meaning, aim, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; object, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Am I wrong?
