too dense to lock them up when kids are in the house forfeit their right to
<BR>
keep and bear.  We are losing twelve kids a day...That's waaay too many
<BR>
(4380 per year) when simple precautions by responsible adults (including
<BR>
the denial of gun possession to the irresponsible adults) could drastically
<BR>
reduce this number.
<BR>
<P>But punishing such irresponsibles (including taking away their guns) before
<BR>
the fact, is clearly impossible without some kind of universal licensing
<BR>
and/or registration of weapons, plus a significant branch of law
<BR>
enforcement devoted to finding violators.  And, according to many opponents
<BR>
of gun-control, such as L. Neil Smith, this makes it much easier for a
<BR>
government to disarm its citizens, and a disarmed citizenry is an important
<BR>
(if not *the* most important) factor in the rise of totalitarianism.  Since
<BR>
totalitarian regimes have and do cause many more deaths than 4380 per year
<BR>
(especially if you include the casualties of war, poverty, and
<BR>
technological stagnation), and since the freest countries have periods of
<BR>
near-totalitarian behavior (Vietnam draft, War on Drugs), these are the
<BR>
questions you should answer:
<BR>
<P>1) What better counterthreat do we have against Bill Clinton, Janet Reno,
<BR>
Barry McCaffrey, et al., than our own lethal force, our own privacy, and
<BR>
that of those around us?  What better way to decrease the chance of Hitler
<BR>
happening here?
<BR>
<P>2) Since we claim to have a very long-term perspective, what relative
<BR>
weights should we assign to a)some thousands of deaths projected for next
<BR>
year, most of which occur in specific settings easily avoidable by you and
<BR>
me, and b)some millions of deaths projected 10 or 30 years in the future,
<BR>
and much less avoidable by you and me?
