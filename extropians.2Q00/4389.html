<P>&lt;&lt; This discussion brings up an interesting problem: what can we say
<BR>
&nbsp;about the large scale character of physical law? Is there any way of
<BR>
&nbsp;estimating the complexity of the rules making up the universe, or
<BR>
&nbsp;whether there are magic physics out there? The first case seems very
<BR>
&nbsp;hard to answer, especially since we cannot base an answer much on what
<BR>
&nbsp;we have discovered so far, since that nmight be heavily biased by our
<BR>
&nbsp;parochial mammal-water-carbon-planetlife outlook. The second at least
<BR>
&nbsp;can be answered if we notice big anomalies elsewhere.
<BR>

That's why I am usually hesitent to proclaim most physical 'laws' and 
<BR>
theories absolute. Notice how the contempoaray Astronomy and Physics 
<BR>
communities fall victim to this? Example: &quot;We've found evidence of Hot Dark 
<BR>
Matter! The Universe shall end in Heat Death!&quot; or &quot;We've found evidence that 
<BR>
the Universe will accelerate eternally, therefore it will expand and 
<BR>
evaporate to nothing!&quot;.  My contention is that we are only as good as our 
<BR>
equipment, and its uses, allow us to be.  My second contention is that when 
<BR>
we get much more and much better devices, this will revolutionize our view of 
<BR>
the universe nearly as much as it did during Kupernik's and Gallileo's epoch. 
<BR>
&nbsp;We discover more, we analyze more, we learn more, and our view change a bit. 
<BR>
We do this enough, and we get paradigm shifts.  As in the period commedy 
<BR>
stated (worth a watch) in &quot;Wellville&quot; as Dr. Kellog (who believes he will be 
<BR>
immortal) dies as he springboards into a pond, the narator quips: &quot;Well Dr. 
<BR>
Kellog didn't know everything!&quot;
