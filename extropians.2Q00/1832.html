<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Spike, I have to disagree with this.  Intelligence and emotion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  are two entirely different realms.  I would say that the more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  intelligent you are, the more capable you may be of managing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  or balancing &quot;conflicting&quot; emotions.  For example, emotions may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be very short-term reward based.  It takes intelligence to translate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that into a long term risk-benefit tradeoff analysis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not true. If nothing else, &quot;realms&quot; implies that there are spaces, or 
<BR>
rooms where we store thoughts and emotions. This is an illusion. Human 
<BR>
cognition is a continuum constantly shifting from state to state. 
<BR>
<P>Although it is true that one can, through intelligence, become more skilled 
<BR>
at emotion, it is not because intelligence is separate from emotion or 
<BR>
superincumbant. It is *possible* to subject and  &quot;master&quot; your conflicting 
<BR>
emotions by pretending they are not a part of your intellect, but it's an 
<BR>
error of judgment. 
<BR>
<P>Emotions are little understood and there for expression of emotions is 
<BR>
frowned upon in our culture. Unrevealed and conflicting emotions can cause 
<BR>
people to act out in various ways. One assumes that intellect is &quot;superior&quot; 
<BR>
to emotion; that it produces a clearer version of reality, and clearer goals 
<BR>
and a clearer course of action. It is not OK to be conflicted, apparently. We 
<BR>
are supposed to have &quot;transgressed&quot; beyond any conflicts. Hence the common 
<BR>
&quot;lizard brain&quot; excuse for having modern feelings.
<BR>
<P>It is not a battle between two &quot;realms&quot; it is a natural, circuitous, shifting 
<BR>
and weighing between two important parts of cognition that are both important 
<BR>
to the minds healthy functioning.
<BR>
<P>Our so called lizard brain usually only kicks in when we are faced with a 
<BR>
huge shock or fear reaction. Yet, it's become fashionable to *blame* our 
<BR>
ancient mind on emotions that are tortuous, uncontrollable or otherwise 
<BR>
unpleasant. We *thank* our intellect for emotions such as tranquility, 
<BR>
satisfaction, contentment and joy. We try to not let emotion guide us, 
<BR>
because we do not trust it's power over us.
<BR>
<P>It is true that when one indulges in reasoning/rational (linear, problem 
<BR>
solving) thought, one shifts away from the emotional end of the spectrum of 
<BR>
thought, and is less likely to be influenced by random emotion. This is 
<BR>
comforting for it feels like we have control.  
<BR>
<P>They are not two unrelated functions. Your perception stream or &quot;thought 
<BR>
stream&quot; is inevitably linked by emotion when you are in most normal states of 
<BR>
thought. The fact that emotions produce very healthy and creative 
<BR>
associations in both artists and scientists is well documented.
<BR>
<P>When one is tuned finely to one's emotions, and perceives them as a natural, 
<BR>
healthy motivator and helmsman, it shows maturity and wisdom. Wisdom is a 
<BR>
part of intelligence.
