Extract from <A HREF="http://www.harrybrowne.org/">http://www.harrybrowne.org/</A> (US libertarian presidential
<BR>
candidate):
<BR>
<P>&quot;Today (according to the U.S. Census Bureau) federal, state, and local taxes
<BR>
take 47% of the national income.&quot;
<BR>
<P>i.e. those in the &quot;land of the free&quot; spend close to 50% of their working
<BR>
lives (minus market value of those public services they actually wanted) as
<BR>
government owned slaves.
<BR>
<P>NB I don't think the situation is much better in Britain - I hope the figure
<BR>
isn't as high as that, but it wouldn't suprise me if it was. (In the most
<BR>
recent budget here there were a lot of &quot;stealth&quot; tax increases which don't
<BR>
show up in simple income tax calculations). My point is that both sides of
<BR>
this mini US v UK tax debate seem to be seriously underestimating the amount
<BR>
stolen by their respective governments.
<BR>
<P>And as for Martin Ling's comments:
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's not stealing if those people have agreed to pay. Which, technically,
<BR>
they have. By remaining in the country, and by
<BR>
upholding the government and its taxation policies.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I'm sorry, but this is ludicrous.  The fact that I haven't emigrated is in
<BR>
no way an endorsement of government theft of my money.  I didn't vote for
<BR>
them and the only reason I &quot;agree to pay&quot; (to use your terminology) is
<BR>
because if I don't, my property itself will be stolen or I'll be imprisoned.
<BR>
<P>By your logic, there's nothing wrong with protection rackets run by
<BR>
organised crminals - because after all, their victims have &quot;agreed to pay&quot;
<BR>
(if only to prevent their property from being torched), and of course, they
<BR>
could always move to a different part of the country.
