<EM>&gt;Dr. Dobbs-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-snip-Dozens of studies during the last 20 years have shown that good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;working practices improve programmer productivity more than new languages,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;WYSIWYG interfaces, CASE tools, and other silver bullets (see, for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Steve McConnell's Rapid Development, Microsoft Press, 1996, ISBN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1556159005). Despite this, most programmers still start coding without a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;design, then go on to short-change testing and set wildly unrealistic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;delivery schedules.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-snip-Open Source, Open Science
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The lack of software-engineering skills among scientists and engineers has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;become a critical bottleneck in many fields. Computer simulations are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;increasingly used to study problems that are too big, too small, too fast,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;too slow, too expensive, or too dangerous to study in the laboratory. Many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scientists and engineers also now realize that publication and peer review
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of software need to be as integral a part of computational science as they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are of experimental science (see &quot;Catalyzing Open Source Development in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Science,&quot; by J. Daniel Gezelter, Open Source/Open Science '99, http://
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;www.openscience .org/talks/bnl/index.html).

The man who designed the Gossimer Albatross gave a talk a decade or so ago 
<BR>
which was broadcast on local radio.  His subject was the cultural 
<BR>
differences in attitude toward &quot;design.&quot;  The British, he noted, used to 
<BR>
send agents out to find &quot;mast trees.&quot;  They would set a little fence around 
<BR>
the base of the tree with a sign indicating this was property of the crown.  
<BR>
The measure of a nation's naval power was how many &quot;masts&quot; it could float.
<BR>
<P>So then the British came to N. America, where they were faced with a literal 
<BR>
SEA of masts, as far as the eye could see or a horse carry one.  The design 
<BR>
philosophy throughout Europe was based on scarcity of resources and a 
<BR>
plentitude of labor.  Thus they thought nothing of making plans centuries in 
<BR>
advance - which meant keeping people occupied in such planning.  Before you 
<BR>
acted, you spent real time and effort on design.
<BR>
<P>The design philosophy in America evolved in the late 19th or early 20th 
<BR>
century to the engineering maxim that &quot;we can build anything for a dollar a 
<BR>
pound.&quot;  It is worthwhile to compare the Amiga OS, which originated in 
<BR>
Britain as TRIPOS, a real-time industrial control mini-computer OS, or 
<BR>
LINUX, or Gasse's BeOS, with the American products - MS/DOS, Windows, MacOS. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With design and forethought, the Amiga OS could easilly run rings around 
<BR>
Windows or the Mac at the same clock speed, yet it was much easier to use, 
<BR>
more stable, and a tiny fraction of the size.  (Imagine being able to format 
<BR>
not one, but several floppies, simultaneously, while running five or six 
<BR>
applications and communicating online with no noticeable slowdown, and being 
<BR>
able to switch tasks in 1/60th of a second, reliably.  The Amiga was doing 
<BR>
that in 1990.)
<BR>
<P>Then look at the absolutely unbelievable bugs and stupidity of Windows, that 
<BR>
can't even recall from one instant to the next what kind of view you want - 
<BR>
icons, list, details, big icons.  It's a random draw - except when Windows 
<BR>
willy-nilly decides to default to some view permanently - which happens.  
<BR>
And the errors were carried forward from Win'95 to '98!  If someone had told 
<BR>
me that such an atrocity was going to be the dominant OS of the year 2000 in 
<BR>
1980, I would have thought they were insane.
