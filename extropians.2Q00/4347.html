The term &quot;urban sprawl&quot; is being tested by the Gore campaign as one of its 
<BR>
buzz-terms.  Central-planner-types are increasingly using this term as a 
<BR>
stalking horse for re-entry into centers of power throughout the US.  And it 
<BR>
seems there's a chance they'll have at least some success in this campaign, 
<BR>
as dissatisfaction with the state of America's cities DOES seem to be 
<BR>
growing.  As the current longest period of economic growth in US history 
<BR>
continues, places like Silicon Valley and Atlanta are coming to join the 
<BR>
ranks of the previous sprawl-queens, LA and Houston.  Commute times are 
<BR>
growing at an increasing pace, as is the air pollution load caused by 
<BR>
internal combustion engines.  Growing cities ARE having an increasing 
<BR>
negative impact on surrounding ecosystems (although not nearly the level of 
<BR>
damage that the planners maintain).
<BR>
<P>I wonder what developments extropians would support as an alternative to 
<BR>
central planning to address this issue.  These are some I see:
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt; Natural &quot;Edge City Densification&quot;.  Here in Houston, we're seeing a 
<BR>
pattern of commercial real estate development at the nodes of the main 
<BR>
highway system on the outskirts of town.  Houston is perhaps the most natural 
<BR>
&quot;Car Town&quot; on the planet, since its growth is not constrained by geography 
<BR>
(except on the southeast side where the port makes a narrow radial entry into 
<BR>
the otherwise nearly perfect concentric-ring development pattern of the 20th 
<BR>
Century city fed by radial freeway arteries and concentric ring roads).  
<BR>
Major groups of 5-25-story office buildings are being built at the 
<BR>
intersection of the radial and ring freeways, &quot;seeding&quot; development of a more 
<BR>
complete urban landscape at multiple locations as far out as 15-20 miles from 
<BR>
the city center.  These new nodes of conurbation seem to be acting as 
<BR>
&quot;magnets&quot;, offsetting the otherwise steady centrifugal force of freeway-fed 
<BR>
growth.  With no zoning laws (we've defeated them in three successive 
<BR>
plebiscites), this development in Houston is certainly not the result of 
<BR>
central planning.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  Telecommuting.  Talked about as a tonic to commuter gridlock for a 
<BR>
decade, we OUGHT to be seeing an effect right about now as more and more 
<BR>
people have sufficient bandwidth in their homes to work from there.  I know 
<BR>
that I have developed a pattern of working from home a few days a month and I 
<BR>
seem to be encountering more anecdotal evidence of this trend as time goes 
<BR>
on.  But people still like the sociability of an office environment (I know I 
<BR>
do).  I'd look for the development of generic &quot;Edge City Workspaces&quot; for 
<BR>
semi-telecommuting, where people with disparate professions could share an 
<BR>
office space and some of the overhead of equipment and facilities (like 
<BR>
high-end videoconferencing) near their suburban homes.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  Electric/Hybrid Cars.  Long an electro-skeptic, I'm seeing electrics and 
<BR>
especially hybrids coming closer and closer to competitiveness.  Especially 
<BR>
with smarter and smarter power-management systems and lighter and lighter 
<BR>
materials, I'd look for the significant impact of electro-hybrids on urban 
<BR>
hydrocarbon pollution within the next ten years.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  Smart Cars.  Although Gore supports &quot;smart highways&quot;, I think anyone with 
<BR>
much sense knows that this is a stalking horse for a major tax-and-spend orgy 
<BR>
for the central planners.  It's not hard to imagine Gore's kind getting us 
<BR>
committed to a huge &quot;National Smart Highway Initiative&quot; that would be 
<BR>
obsolete before it's even begun.  However, a packet-switched system where 
<BR>
most of the smarts are in the cars DOES seem to offer promise for some relief 
<BR>
from freeway congestion without losing the merits of individual choice in 
<BR>
mobility that Americans clearly prize very highly.  I'd be curious to get 
<BR>
some pointers from anyone who is following this line of development closely 
<BR>
so we could make some intelligent guesses about how it might become a 
<BR>
significant trend and how soon it might offer some relief to the weary 
<BR>
commuter.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure there are other trends and developments I'm overlooking.  Comments?
