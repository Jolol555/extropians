For anyone looking for something to read I would like to recommend: &quot;The 
<BR>
Millionare Next Door&quot; The suprising secrets of America's wealthy.  ISBN 
<BR>
0-671-01520-6 Thomas J Stanley and William D Danko.
<BR>
<P>The same authors also have a new book, &quot;The Millionare Mind&quot;.  This is a 
<BR>
good answer to &quot;If your so smart, why aren't you rich&quot;.  Extropians should 
<BR>
be both.&quot;

Brian,
<BR>
You are so right.  I had defined for myself that the goals of an
<BR>
Extropian are:
<BR>
1.  Health and life extension.
<BR>
2.  Wealth
<BR>
3.  Knowledge
<BR>
<P>We seem to have a lot of information about the first goal becoming
<BR>
available and being discussed to some extent on this list.
<BR>
<P>If a person really wants the 2nd goal they could make a good start by
<BR>
reading THE MILLIONAIRE NEXT DOOR.  A second step is to read the pages of 
<BR>
Motley Fool available online and in PB at your local bookstore.  A third 
<BR>
step would be to calculate the consequences of investing $2,000 per year at 
<BR>
11% for a long term.  The Motley Fool I believe advocates a lot of methods 
<BR>
for individuals that don't want to make investing a major undertaking.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I found these two posts very thought-provoking and exciting.  I'm glad to 
<BR>
have you two gentlemen on board.  I have wondered myself about &quot;of you're so 
<BR>
smart, why aren't you rich?&quot;  Every other person on this list would be a 
<BR>
multi-millioniare if brains and education were the only key factors. lol
<BR>
<P>I have read portions of &quot;The Millioniare Mind&quot; and found it fascinating.  I 
<BR>
am going to have to buy a copy and finish it.  The book shared how many 
<BR>
rich, self-made parents want their kids to become professionals(doctors, 
<BR>
lawyers, dentists, etc.) and are willing to foot the bill for their 
<BR>
education, rather then have them take over the business or try to start 
<BR>
their own.  This is because running a successful business can be so 
<BR>
difficult and the failure rate is so high.
<BR>
<P>I enjoyed the three goals given for every extropian.  I would add one more.
<BR>
<P>4.  Sharing extropian memes with others in a positive way.
<BR>
<P>I admit feeling frustration when a popular list thread is on what we would 
<BR>
do if we each had a billion dollars or even a few tens of million to invest 
<BR>
and donate! lol  I wish we did have one or several wealthy patrons here who 
<BR>
could help move things forward in areas like Eliezer's singularity project.  
<BR>
Perhaps, some of the very people on this list will in time achieve great 
<BR>
financial success.
<BR>
<P>I would love to see a research project for total brain vitrification.  This 
<BR>
has been estimated to be a ten year project in the ten million dollar range. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For reversible suspension, add another zero!  There are a few in the 
<BR>
cryonics community who could easily fund this but they choose not to.
<BR>
<P>As a place to gather, relax and network, the cryonics enclave should be 
<BR>
wonderful.  It will be a place for cryonicists, extropians and 
<BR>
transhumanists in general to come and gain inspiration and knowledge in 
<BR>
areas such as life-extension and wealth building.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
