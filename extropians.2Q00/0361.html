<BR>
<EM>&gt; Btw, I find it curious people are shocked to find that they might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agree with something Kaczynski wrote.  Would they be shocked if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kaczynski had written that the sun will rise tomorrow, or that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computers will get cheaper? Why must a person who does evil things be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong about everything? 
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you're taking Hal's (and Joy's) statement wrong.  When Joy says he 
<BR>
finds something to agree with in something Kaczynski wrote, the phrasing 
<BR>
indicates that it's something that's of a piece with Kaczynski's outlook.  
<BR>
If it was something Kaczynski had said about child-rearing techniques or 
<BR>
some artist that Joy liked, Joy would have said that Kaczynski had 
<BR>
reasonable views about the subject instead.  If I were to say that I found 
<BR>
something I thought was reasonable in Ralph Nader's writings you'd think I 
<BR>
was being disingenuous if I later revealed that it was something he wrote 
<BR>
about preferring the weather near the Mediterranean to that of southern 
<BR>
India.
<BR>
<P>The only reason to bring up Kaczynski is as an icon of anti-technology 
<BR>
theology.  Agreeing with him on any other subject is irrelevant.
