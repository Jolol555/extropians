<EM>&gt; Whats Tagging?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You mean spray painting fur wearers? I would say that anyone who tags a woman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wearing fur must give equal time to men and hang outside a biker bar and tag the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first leather clad biker that comes out... &lt;g&gt; otherwise it just sexist and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speciesist. Bovines of the World, Unite! Bovine Liberation Army Front..
</EM><BR>
<P>No, &quot;tagging&quot; as in spray painting on every surface possible- those
<BR>
annoying &quot;kilroy was here&quot; graffitos.  I gotta admire the courage of the
<BR>
maniac that tagged a concrete wall on the median of I-10 in LA- with
<BR>
only 18&quot; of clearance from the high speed traffic in the left lane. 
<BR>
Still, it's vandalism of someone else's property.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; IMHO OK Bad behaviors when nobody is watching or around:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speeding
</EM><BR>
No harm no foul- but your insurance company has an interest here in that
<BR>
your speeding increases their risk.  I'd support their case to not pay
<BR>
off if you hit a bridge abutment at 120 mph- &quot;An obvious case of
<BR>
suicide, your honor.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; catch &amp; not release
</EM><BR>
A possible harm, as in the tragedy of the commons.  Overfishing could
<BR>
result if all your friends who feel the same way go fishing there too.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; running red lights &amp; stop signs
</EM><BR>
Provided you have a clear view of the other approaches, so that you do
<BR>
not put anyone else at risk.  Most stop signs are placed on
<BR>
intersections where such a view is not possible, though.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; streaking
</EM><BR>
Well, some folks really shouldn't just on esthetic grounds ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; outdoors sex
</EM><BR>
As long as you don't scare the livestock and the children. (Heck, when I
<BR>
was a kid, I spied on a couple in the woods with gleeful fascination.
<BR>
Educational, it was :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; billboard sabotage
</EM><BR>
Ugly as they may be, they *are* private property.  Sue the owners for
<BR>
damage to your own property value, due to the eyesore.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; foodfights at MacDonalds
</EM><BR>
Only if you pay extra for the cleanup.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One of my favorites:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Back in college, when someone passed out at our frat house, a group of us would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'food' them, which entailed moving them to the banquet table, and dressing them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up with various foods from the kitchen such that they looked like a buffet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spread.
</EM><BR>
<P>Silly, but not harmful... just make sure the poor fool isn't in danger
<BR>
of alcohol poisoning.
