<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have a hot discussion on this at University. In Germany, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Anti-Gun faction is very strong and believes in the theory that no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;guns results in no gun-related crimes. I tried pointing out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;different but it seems that this is quite a &quot;belief&quot; rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;something rational. As a matter of fact, I am neither pro-gun nor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anti-gun, because I do not have enough information to decide on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;this. One of the key arguments that struck me was the fact, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it is usually non-libertarian countries who forbid guns. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Communists and the Nazi are but two excellent examples of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;political systems who had a great interest in disarming their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In this country we call them democrats.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, well, in Germany, this is public oppinion. For a long time I was against
<BR>
guns, too, but then I slowly began to doubt if this was the right choice. I
<BR>
don't know of a politician openly advocating liberal gun laws.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; May I suggest www.nraila.org for more info.
</EM><BR>
Thanks, that's just what I needed. I wonder if it would be possible to
<BR>
organize such a lobby in Germany.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We don't have a problem with the truth, the other side does.
</EM><BR>
It seems so. But do you know how you can tell that a politician is lying? He
<BR>
opens his mouth ...
<BR>
<P>At least that's the case here in Germany.
