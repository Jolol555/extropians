<EM>&gt; Not so. Foreign companies cannot have anti-trust actions brought against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them, only US based companies can be charged with such 'crimes'.
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh-huh. Then the EU anti-trust investigation into Microsoft must be
<BR>
imaginary, right?
<BR>
<P>Most other countries have _tougher_ anti-trust laws than the US. The
<BR>
EU and the DOJ had a &quot;gentleman's agreement&quot; not to duplicate effort
<BR>
while one of 'em was investigating -- now that MS has been found guilty
<BR>
in the US, the EU investigation is rolling ahead. 
<BR>
<P>(Oh, and then there's the French investigation. _That_ one is dynamite --
<BR>
the charges are extremely serious and typically carry prison sentences
<BR>
for the directors of companies found guilty under them, because the
<BR>
French charges aren't about anti-trust -- they're anti-FRAUD, and they
<BR>
allege that Microsoft defrauded the French government. Oops ...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Especially if MS has no actual offices left here, they are merely an OEM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supplier to PC makers and software distributors, or they just distribute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over the ineternet. Foreign traders can only be charged with anti-trust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crimes if they are American citizens or American based corporations, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the American based divisions of foreign corporations. 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Microsoft occupies a similar monopoly position in the rest of the world,
<BR>
if not a tighter one -- and typically charges more for its software.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, Bill would be dumb to fire all of his employees, however buying an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; island and developing it for use by as many of his current employees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that want to move there, then simply subcontract the rest who want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stay in Redmond, would be rather easy.
</EM><BR>
<P>And put him outside NAFTA and the EU, making him vulnerable to import
<BR>
duty and other taxes.
