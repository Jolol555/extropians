<EM>&gt; &gt; House Votes to Ban Per-Minute Internet Access Charges
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If Internet users were charged by the minute when they surfed the web or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; e-mailed their friends and family, it would drastically increase the cost,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and dramatically inhibit the use, of the Internet.  This bill would help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; keep the Internet affordable for all Americans.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It's good to see these guys can get something right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't see this as &quot;getting it right&quot; at all.  In the short run, this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is one regulating agency patching a problem created by another, made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary because of the artificial monopoly they both created.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the long run it will make access /more/ expensive, not less, than if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both agencies got out of the way and let the market work.  In a free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market, prices are lowest when they are structured most closely to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality of the costs of producing the product.  Network access time is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a scarce commodity measured by time; two minutes of access time really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is twice as valuable as one minute.  If consumers are forced by law to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buy it by the month and average their use, some group of consumers will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realize that they can overgraze the commons by hogging their full month
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and subletting time to others; and they don't have the infrastructure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the original providers do for maintaining the equipment, supporting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; users, etc., so they will contract for those services from the original
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provider at the expense of the its non-hogging customers, further
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasing costs, etc., etc.  It's cheaper just to cut out the middle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and let the big boys sell minutes in the first place.
</EM><BR>
<P>These aren't ISP or phone company fees, these are FFC taxes on per
<BR>
minute use of the web. The proposals that the FCC has been playing with
<BR>
is to use these per minute FCC taxes to fund a big government welfare
<BR>
agency to 'close the internet gap' that the democrats claim exists. 
<BR>
<P>There are also plenty of ISP accounts that people buy that are unlimited
<BR>
use for a flat fee per month. Unlimited use means unlimited use, not
<BR>
just a lot of use.
