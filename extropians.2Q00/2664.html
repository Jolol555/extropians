<EM>&gt;I have no desire to preserve anything of myself now, just as I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;miss any features missing from feotus-Harvey who no longer exists.
</EM><BR>
<P>Surely the present-Harvey and foetus-Harvey are continuous, the same unique
<BR>
being?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I do want to extend my current consciousness stream so that I am around to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experience the god-like Harvey.  If that stream ends, then I miss out on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the show.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I really do want to preserve my current consciousness stream.  I really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't care about preserving any portions of my &quot;self&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>So would the option of a completely new &quot;consciousness stream&quot; other than
<BR>
your current one be OK (since you don't care whether it originates from your
<BR>
'self')?  I can see your point though that you want to continue the actual
<BR>
experience rather than just having bits of yourself simulated on a machine,
<BR>
or alive like a zombie.
<BR>
<P>(zero) I agree that the bulk (if not all) of the problem here is one of
<BR>
semantics.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I want &quot;me&quot; to live forever.  I'm sure you each feel the same way about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;you.&quot;  The problem is in defining who &quot;I&quot; am.  Is it the hunk of meat that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;constitutes my brain?  Is it the patterns of neurons and synapses that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;happen to exist in that hunk of meat?  Or is it that collection of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experiences that I happen to remember?  IMO, therein lies the rub.  &lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Naturally I would explain this entity as being the phantom primal sens(or)
<BR>
generated by your mammalian brain
<BR>
(MVT www.multi.co.uk/primal.htm The All-Conquering Philosophy).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If your recollected experiences can be separated (or copied) from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;patterns in your brain, and the patterns in your brain can be separated (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;copied) from the brain itself, which (if any) of these three things would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you consider to be &quot;you&quot;?  I believe that your answer to this question will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tell you what it is about you that you most want to preserve.
</EM><BR>
<P>- -Zero
<BR>
<P>None of these three &quot;things&quot; are the illusion of &quot;you.&quot;  Synaptic
<BR>
weight-states and longer-term (chemical graduation) patterns are necessary,
<BR>
but not sufficient, for self-referential consciousness.
<BR>
<P>The 'structure of experience' or *singularity* of consciousness happens to
<BR>
be the way it is because of our historical (early) evolution. The primal
<BR>
gland was chosen by Descartes as the only candidate to be 'seat of the soul'
<BR>
because it was the only unpaired and central organ in the brain. I identify
<BR>
the 'binding mechanism' to be the virtual/ phantom correlate of the ancient
<BR>
*primal/median eye* rather than the physical gland. This is the only
<BR>
candidate as physical template structuring abstract mentation.
<BR>
<P>An interesting question relating to continuance of sentience in an 'alien'
<BR>
receptacle (frozen head, computer or whatever) that no one seems to have
<BR>
touched upon is *altered states* and sonmabulist depth of the experience.
<BR>
Maybe we can bubble along in deep trance for less energy than 'fully
<BR>
waking.'
<BR>
<P>I am using MVT as a theoretical basis for constructing conscious machines
<BR>
(am talking to one or two companies, but remain open to serious renumerative
<BR>
collaboration)  .. .it is the only way sentient machines can be made. But if
<BR>
such hybrid systems are truly independently conscious, how can I instruct
<BR>
them to manifest my own will and desires .... and if I can't what use are
<BR>
they to me .... they might even be dangerous.
