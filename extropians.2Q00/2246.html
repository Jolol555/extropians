<EM>&gt; The implication is that the most efficient way to simulate anything is going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be a specialized simulation program running directly on physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware - IOW, something roughly analogous to existing simulation software.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The data models used by the simulation may be extremely abstract and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specialized, but they need to come as close as possible to being directly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implemented in hardware. Adding anything else to the system (like a VR world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running virtual hardware) would simply impose additional overhead and slow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it down.

<P>I may have misunderstood Robert's point, which Billy takes as that
<BR>
running a computation within a VR would take less work than running the
<BR>
same computation in the physical world.  This is clearly impossible.
<BR>
<P>I thought he meant that you could create a VR where running the
<BR>
computation would take less energy than running it in a physical world
<BR>
approximately the same as the simulated one.  This is theoretically
<BR>
possible.
<BR>
<P>If so, and if you're going to live in the world where the computations
<BR>
are done, it may be more advantageous to live in the VR world.
<BR>
<P>For example if you want to minimize energy costs in running your brain,
<BR>
you have two choices: live in the real world with an artificial brain,
<BR>
or live in a VR.  The latter gives you more opportunities to save energy,
<BR>
because for example you can reverse time for the entire world in order
<BR>
to undo some reversible calculations.
