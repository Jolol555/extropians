Subject: Proposal for World Future Society
<BR>
Hi, this is Mizuho from Japan.
<BR>
<P>Maybe you know, World Future Society, which has 30,000
<BR>
futurists as members, has opened &quot;Social Innovation Forum&quot;
<BR>
on there site and has recieved proposal.
<BR>
(The URL of the forum is <A HREF="http://www.wfs.org/innovate.htm">http://www.wfs.org/innovate.htm</A>)
<BR>
We think if humans had the potential to transcend death
<BR>
and live indefinitely, we would be more willing to invest
<BR>
in the future and to create societies.So we proposed the forum as follows;  
<BR>
Any comment is appreciated.
<BR>
Mizuho---------------------------------------------
<BR>
Title: Transcending Death to Innovate the Future Society
<BR>
Even the remarkable progress of science and technology has failed to
<BR>
discontinue wars and hunger on the earth. This is because people
<BR>
see the future as something not belonging to them. If they can see
<BR>
an unbounded lifespan in front of them, they will start behaving much
<BR>
better because their future lives will clearly be decided by their
<BR>
present ways of living. In the past, religions have served as vehicles
<BR>
of guiding people to good conduct. Today, science and technology can
<BR>
enhance for this role of religions.
<BR>
<P>If people who seek the betterment of the future and the reanimation
<BR>
in that better future constructed by themselves come together
<BR>
and form a large group, it will be a powerful force in our society.
<BR>
Its force will improve our society and make social innovation.
<BR>
We are determined to continue working for the future and to enter
<BR>
cryopreservation to reach that future, if necessary.
<BR>
If cryopreservation is necessary, we expect our future successors to
<BR>
reanimate us. We also believe that, if you live an honest,
<BR>
productive, and esteemed life, then people of the future will want to
<BR>
reanimate you.
<BR>
<P>Why don't you join us and work together toward constructing a the better 
<BR>
future?  Then you may be able to open a new chapter of your life in that 
<BR>
future.
<BR>
