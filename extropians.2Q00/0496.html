<P>
Here's something from an Oz site, posted March 25 this year
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.guncontrol.org.au/nra_fud.html">http://www.guncontrol.org.au/nra_fud.html</A>
<BR>
<P>with some [explications by me]
<BR>
<P>==============
<BR>
<P>Aside from a host of  factual errors (including a description of &quot;Mr&quot; Meg
<BR>
Lees of the Australian Democrats as the leader of &quot;a small but vocal group
<BR>
of hard leftists&quot;) [she leads a middle-of-the-road but by Oz standards
<BR>
slightly rightish minority party] more serious misinformation in the pieces
<BR>
include the following claims, with correct data provided from Australian
<BR>
Bureau of  Statistics and Australian Institute of Criminology publications: 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The claims incorrectly assume that 1997 is the first year after the new
<BR>
gun laws became operative. In 1996-7 the laws were changed. 1998  is the
<BR>
first year statistics can be tested. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Claim 1. Australian homicides are up 3.2% since the new laws. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, compared to the average of the two years prior to new gun laws
<BR>
becoming operative (1996-1997), gun homicides dropped by  37.8%. Murder by
<BR>
all means dropped 13.7%. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Claim 2. Armed robberies are up by a &quot;whopping&quot; 44% since the new laws.
<BR>
In fact the rate of armed robbery increase dropped 12% in  1998. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Claim 3. Assaults are up 8.6% since the new laws. In fact the rate of
<BR>
assaults increase dropped by 4.2% in 1998. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Claim 4. In [the state of] Victoria there was a 300% increase in
<BR>
homicides following the new laws. In fact the homicide rate in Victoria
<BR>
dropped by 19.8%  in 1998. Victoria has for many years had the lowest
<BR>
homicide rate of the six Australian states. In three months we will have
<BR>
the 1999 ABS  statistics. These will allow the matter to be re-examined. 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>FYI.
