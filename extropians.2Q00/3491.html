<P><EM>&gt;People are assumng something that I can't assume, which is that in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transparent, surveillanced society that courts would exist in the way they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think they'd be nearly obsolete.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If every act was archived, every action known by all, prosecutors, lawyers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and judges would have to go the way of the dodo.For this reason alone, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;couldn't happen, since lawyers need jobs as much as criminals do.
</EM><BR>
<P>Lawyers may need jobs.  But they don't have to be litigators.  Litigation 
<BR>
lawyers are IMO probably *the* single biggest drain on the economy ever 
<BR>
invented.  I agree that *complete* transparency would probably largely spell 
<BR>
the end of litigation as we know it, and in turn would be the end of the 
<BR>
great majority of litigation lawyers.  Lawyers, though, will still be needed 
<BR>
as long as there are so many laws on the books that the average person 
<BR>
cannot stay abreast of those which impact them.  We will need to consult 
<BR>
with them for everything from tax advice, estate planning, pre-marital 
<BR>
arrangements and contract negotiation.  But transparency, if for no other 
<BR>
reason, will be well worth it for doing away with litigation.
