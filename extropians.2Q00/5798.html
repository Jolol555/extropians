<EM>&gt; Trouble is, carjackers have a bad habit of capping slow-reacting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; victims, or of taking female victims along for rape &amp; murder.  Stopping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them at the door is a Good Thing.  The first torch unit used in the US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would land the user in jail, alas.  Maybe if it followed the flames with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a halon spray to put the perp out before letting him get totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toasted... but the prosecutors would probably still label it first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; degree arson.
</EM><BR>
<P>I once heard of someone who put a piece of wood with nails in it under his
<BR>
seat so that if someone sat down on the driver's seat he'd get punctured. He
<BR>
did this because his car wos broken in several times. Well, only soem nights
<BR>
later he heard a loud cry, and, yes, it had worked ... but he got a heavy
<BR>
fine for severe injury. That's law in Germany - I love it. Perhaps that's
<BR>
why I would like to go into politics.
