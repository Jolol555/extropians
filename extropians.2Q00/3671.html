Subject: Announcement: New structured discussion on RandFem list
<BR>
<P>Announcement:
<BR>
<P>A structured discussion of a new paper by Bryan Register will take
<BR>
place on the Randian-feminism mailing list, starting monday May
<BR>
29th, and closing two weeks later on sunday June 10th.  During
<BR>
this period, other discussion threads and topics will be closed.
<BR>
The paper is entitled _Ayn Rand's Approaches to Sexuality: Their
<BR>
Values, Disvalues, and Significances_.
<BR>
<P>The first paragraph of the paper, summarizing its theme, reads:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a libertarian capitalist who celebrates western culture,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;science, and the technological mastery of nature, Ayn Rand is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sort of woman many contemporary feminists might want to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call a traitor to femininity.(1) Before we ratify this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assessment, though, it may be of interest to try to situate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rand's writings on sexuality within feminist discourse. This
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reading, marginalized by Rand's followers and by the feminist
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;establishment alike, is hardly supported by Rand's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intentions. Nevertheless, in this paper, I will investigate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rand's views from the perspective of Glennon's ideal-type
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis of feminist discourse. On the one hand, I will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider and reject the claim that Rand is a synthesist, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argue that Rand's critique of contemporary gender roles is an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instrumentalist critique. But on the other hand, I will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;investigate the darker underside of Rand's bizarre sexual
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ontology, finding elements of Aristotelian biologistic polarism
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;propping up the theory and practice of the oppression of women.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will propose that Rand thus keys us in to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dangers of polaristic feminism.
<BR>
<P>The entire paper is available here:

<BR>
<P>We hope you will read it, find it of interest, and participate
<BR>
actively in the discussion.
<BR>
<P>The paper was delivered at this conference:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Female Principle: Eclipses and Re-Emergences
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Conference on the Suppressions and Reassertions of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female Principle in Human Cultures
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University of Texas at Arlington, March 30 - April 1, 2000
<BR>
<P>The CFP for this conference was posted on the Rand-fem list last
<BR>
year.  The information about the conference is repeated below, as
<BR>
background information for anyone interested.
<BR>
<P>Keynote Speakers:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha Nussbaum
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drucilla Cornell
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eva Keuls
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nancy Tuana
<BR>
<P>This interdisciplinary conference recognizes the suppression of
<BR>
femaleness as a primary meaning of Western and other cultures over
<BR>
a long period. It seeks to document, account for, and interpret
<BR>
this suppression via the forms it takes -- many still concealed,
<BR>
clandestine, underexplored -- and their counterforms, from early
<BR>
periods to the present, and to identify and describe newly
<BR>
developing practices that counter it. Exposures, descriptions, and
<BR>
theorizations of this suppressions may be essential to projecting
<BR>
a future for femaleness in human societies.
<BR>
<P>Papers may be descriptive, and/or interpretive or theoretical
<BR>
accounts of specific forms of suppressions, such as the sexual; of
<BR>
forms taken by coverups of suppression; of cultural contexts
<BR>
mandating suppression; and of examples that suppression overlooks
<BR>
-- all these in discourses and social practices worldwide.
<BR>
Cross-disciplinary and new theoretical approaches are encouraged.
<BR>
<P><P>Bryan Register is a second-year graduate student in the department
<BR>
of philosophy of the University of Texas at Austin. He has
<BR>
interned at the Institute for Objectivist Studies, has been a
<BR>
teaching assistant for introductory philosophy classes, and will
<BR>
in the fall open a small business lecturing on political
<BR>
philosophy to high school debate students in the Austin area. His
<BR>
first academic publication was &quot;The Universality and Employment of
<BR>
Concepts&quot;, in the Journal of Ayn Rand Studies I-2. He has led
<BR>
on-line Objectivist discussions of feminism in 1996 and 1999,
<BR>
including co-moderating the structured discussion of Gladstein/
<BR>
Sciabarra's _The Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand_ on the
<BR>
Randian-Feminism list. He has written a review essay on feminism
<BR>
for The Objectivist Center's membership newsletter &quot;Navigator&quot; in
<BR>
1999, and debated the merits of feminism in &quot;Free Radical&quot; in
<BR>
2000. The paper now to be discussed was his first presentation at
<BR>
an academic conference.
