<P>
This past monday, in case it wasn't in your local paper (and considering they
<BR>
way they lean usually, it probably wasn't), the Supreme Court ruled in favor of
<BR>
the defendant, Lopez, in deciding that the Gun-Free School Zones Act is
<BR>
unconstitutional in its overly broad claim under the Commerce Clause. They ruled
<BR>
that a person carrying a weapon on school grounds or within 1000 feet of school
<BR>
grounds does not fit the definition of engaging in interstate commerce. With
<BR>
this ruling, we have one more nail in the coffin of gun control. The fact this
<BR>
came so soon after the Million Mutha March (oops, make that the 100,000 mom
<BR>
march) indicates that the conservative block of Rhenquist, O'Connor, Kennedy,
<BR>
Scalia, and Thomas that steadily maintains the fundamental principle that &quot;Every
<BR>
law enacted by Congress must be based on one or more of its powers enumerated by
<BR>
the Constitution&quot;, will likely continue on this track when and if it hears US v.
<BR>
Emerson next year, and that even if the 'million' mad muthas are able to
<BR>
shrewify their way into forcing congress to pass a registration law, it will
<BR>
likely be struck down based on this and other precendents. Note that ALL gun
<BR>
control laws at the federal level are solely based upon the Commerce Clause,
<BR>
while state and local laws are based on US. v. Miller..and US. v. Emerson
<BR>
overturns US v. Miller...  Bye, Bye, Rosie O'Donnell, Bye, Bye, Sarah Brady.
<BR>
Don't let the door hit you.....
<BR>
<P>The Court also ruled that the Violence Against Women Act, which enables women to
<BR>
sue people they claim raped them even when the accused are aquitted or not
<BR>
indicted on the charge, was struck down on a similar basis. This basically helps
<BR>
end the past few years of frivolous abuse of rape and workplace harassment
<BR>
laws.  The previous argument for the Commerce Clause basis for the law is a
<BR>
legal theory called the Aggregation Theory, where one incident may not have a
<BR>
measurable effect on commerce, many such incidents do.  Congress claimed in the
<BR>
VAWA that &quot;gender motivated violence deters women from engaging in employment in
<BR>
insterstate commerce&quot; as the legal basis for the law. The Court was unwilling to
<BR>
swallow the aggregate theory logic, and I don't think I do either. I mean,
<BR>
anti-gun motivated state sanctioned violence deters me from engaging in
<BR>
employment in interstate commerce with companies in Massachusetts. I want a
<BR>
lawyer... &lt;g&gt;
<BR>
<P>Assuming Bush gets elected, I forsee US. v. Emerson passing the Court with a
<BR>
devastating victory for gun owner rights and the 2nd Amendment.
