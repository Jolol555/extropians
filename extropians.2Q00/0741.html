<EM>&gt; &gt; Ok, point taken. Now counterpoint: OPEC. OPEC is a monopoly.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No it isn't; OPEC is a cartel. There's a fundamental difference. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; principle any of the members can quit whenever they feel it's in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best interests to do so. Moreover, OPEC adjusts its prices down as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as up, in reaction to variations in demand. What OPEC does is allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the oil producing nations to avoid getting into a cut-throat price war.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which will rapidly turn into a shooting war, in case you hadn't throught
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the determinants of conflict in the Gulf War of 1981-88.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is the only reason we were able to convince the Kuwaitis and Saudis to
<BR>
support an increase in production.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; outside the US, and it exercises quite a bit of control over pricing in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; many nations, but not in the US, however those prices have significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; effects on prices in the US. The US does nothing about this monopoly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Looks like capricious enforcement to me..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No; looks like you've got your definition wrong. Consumers in the USA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are free to buy oil from non-OPEC producers like the UK (world's sixth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; largest oil exporter at one point) or Nigeria or Venezuela or Russia.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact, they do. The reason OPEC decisions affect the price at the pump
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the USA is because (a) the US government has sod-all by way of energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taxes (which is why your cars, domestic appliances, and so on are so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inefficient -- there's no incentive to improve them) so minor tweaks in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the price of crude get passed on directly to the consumer, and (b) OPEC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countries amount to a large proportion of global oil production, so the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-OPEC producers shadow their pricing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which fits the definition of monopoly control distorting the marketplace. I
<BR>
don't care if its a cartel or a quilting club. Its still a monopoly.
<BR>
<P>And you are saying that more taxes and government controls are a good thing?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you remove OPEC, bad things happen:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Firstly, the price of oil crashes. Each oil producer in the middle east will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start pumping like crazy in an attempt to maximize revenue, because everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be trying to undercut their neighbour and when you cut your prices you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to make it up on volume.
</EM><BR>
<P>Outstanding. This is NOT a bad thing. This is a very good thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Secondly, not long thereafter there'll be a horrendous oil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shortage. Because of the price crash, oil will stop being a profitable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business. Tankers will be laid up because it is too expensive to operate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them. Wells will close; places like the North Sea/Shetland fields will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be mothballed.
</EM><BR>
<P>There won't be a shortage, this is bull. The market will finally meet the demand
<BR>
at a market determined price, not a producer determined price. If the british
<BR>
oil unions go out of work, well, I won't cry for them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Basically, prices will yo-yo violently. The whole process will be aggravated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the diminishing reserves -- wildly fluctuating prices will discourage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oil companies from exploring for new fields, too.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fine. We already have plenty of fields as it is, most of which are not being
<BR>
explored only because of governments setting these areas aside in order to
<BR>
maintain an artificially high oil price.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Basically, OPEC stabilizes the marketplace. It's not a monopoly, so it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is forced to take market forces into account -- that's why oil prices
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are currently lower (in real terms) than they were before the OPEC price
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hike of 1973.
</EM><BR>
<P>So how is OPEC stabilizing the oil market any different from Microsoft
<BR>
stabilizing the software market?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For a Microsoft analogy, to give you a feel for how Microsoft looks to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the outside world -- meaning, anyone not native to the USA -- imagine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft was based in Saudi Arabia.  Microsoft has 90% of the operating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system market. Your country is at their mercy. They behave weirdly at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; times, adding the Bible and other un-Islamic texts to the files deleted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by their built-in virus checker.  They hike their prices whenever they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel like it and swear at you if you protest. And their government thumbs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's nose at you. Not exactly the world's best neighbours, no?
</EM><BR>
<P>However, that IS how OPEC behaves, which by your example, is significantly worse
<BR>
than how MS actually behaves.
