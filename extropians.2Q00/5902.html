<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SECTION 24 RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the state, shall not be impaired, but nothing in this section shall be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize, maintain

<EM>&gt; or employ an armed body of men.

<P>Well, that is just Washington State, but the RCW you cite is specifically to
<BR>
prevent private armies. A militia is not a private army, it is a community one.
<BR>
The definition of 'militia' is all able bodied eligible voters in a community.
<BR>
The militia is not a state or national government controlled, regulated, or
<BR>
organized group. The above cited clause does conform with the equal protection
<BR>
clause because it prevents your neighbor from hiring a private army where you
<BR>
cannot. The interesting thing about this clause is that it seems to outlaw all
<BR>
private security corporations in Washington State, something I know for a fact
<BR>
is not being enforced. Taking Seattle specifically, take the security forces at
<BR>
Broadmoor down Madison Park way.... They are armed, they are also in the employ
<BR>
of a private corporation.
