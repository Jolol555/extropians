You have to know they're there. A relatively slow stealth delivery

vehicle with cool exhaust hugging the ground is quite difficult to

see, even from above.

&nbsp;
<BR>
Try spotting a helium-assisted electroflight delivery vehicle, which
<BR>
contains essentially no metal, and is 99% translucent. Or, just
<BR>
camouflage as private aircraft, using teleoperation.

<P><EM> &gt; &gt; Cheap balloon decoys. 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; To do what? they have distinctly different ballistic characteristics and radar
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; signatures.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
It should be not so very difficult to engineer decoys which look like
<BR>
a warhead. In a pinch, just make inflatable warhead-shaped metallized
<BR>
baloons.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; Armored warheads.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Added weight reduces the total number of warheads you can carry, and makes the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; warhead either larger, and thus easier to hit, or else denser, and thus a much
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hotter and easier to spot target.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Of course you deploy decoys before atmospheric reentry. As soon as the 
<BR>
thing encounters enough atmospheric drag to develop a plasma coat,
<BR>
you don't have very much time to hit it.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; Warheads in orbit.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Easily detectable with xray and gamma ray observation platforms. Allowing
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh? A dormant, well-shielded warhead? From a distance of some 100 km?
<BR>
Uh, don't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; warheads in orbit automatically allows you to put warhead powered xray lasers in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; orbit, which are far far cheaper and more effective than any other laser
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; technology. Every bomb you use as an xray pump can kill 50-200 targets at once.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Er, you can only align the bomb towards one target. Nuke for nuke,
<BR>
that's quite expensive. Also, it is very, very difficult to destroy a
<BR>
remote target which is shielded by, say, a few cm of tungsten. I
<BR>
haven't heard of any successfull xRay laser tests in orbit (duh).

&nbsp;
<BR>
Haha. Easily said. Try harden every electronical gadget in the western 
<BR>
hemisphere. See how long it takes. See design costs expand by order of 
<BR>
magnitude. Try enforcing it.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; Suitcase Nukes.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Definite concern, but detectable with satellite technology when unsheilded.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I haven't heard of a technology which can spot a slightly subcritical
<BR>
piece of fissibles on earth ground from orbit. You sure as hell don't
<BR>
see the radiation, and the IR signature is virtually nil.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; And most
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; important of all, quantity.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think shelters everywhere for everybody are much cheaper, and will
<BR>
guarantee &gt;90% survival. Of course, kickstarting everything again in a 
<BR>
nightmarish, heavily contaminated soot-covered UV-blasted landscape
<BR>
does not appear trivial.
