</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is always true of visionary proposals, whether by science fiction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  writers or people named Seward. What characterizes the late twentieth
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  early twenty-first century is a remarkable falling back from the dreams
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the Apollo decades (post World War 2).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I've said before here, I am an irredeemable child of Apollo: Apparently
</EM><BR>
no
<BR>
<EM>&gt; amount of reasoning can convince me that the effort wasn't worthwhile and
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; literally never tire of the story being retold.  But, as David Harland has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointed out in his excellent recent book on the field geology accomplished
</EM><BR>
by
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the Apollo missions, &quot;Exploring the Moon&quot;, &quot;In retrospect, it is clear
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Apollo was an element of twenty-first century exploration which was
</EM><BR>
somehow
<BR>
<EM>&gt; drawn forward 50 years and, incredibly, implemented with early-1960s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electronics technology.&quot; (332-33)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  It should be remembered that most space technology is three to five
<BR>
years behind the leading edge -- most because of testing.  (Correct if I'm
<BR>
wrong here.)  Even the Apollo missions were not using the latest and
<BR>
greatest.  Ditto for Galileo, Pathfinder, the Mars Observer, etc.
<BR>
<P>My point is, space utilization does NOT require really sophisticated
<BR>
technology.  Surely, it can benefit from that, but the Apollo program put
<BR>
many men on the Moon and brought them back safely to Earth long before Apple
<BR>
rolled out its first PC.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; He makes this comment in reviewing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general plan for building space infrastructure that was almost universally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; envisioned in the mid-20th century, before Apollo, i.e. first the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; establishment of reusable, inexpensive access to space, then an orbital
</EM><BR>
space
<BR>
<EM>&gt; station and only then going on to explore and develop Luna and the rest of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the solar system.  I don't think that the people who originally conceived
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that plan, Oberth, Von Braun, Ley, Clarke and others, are or would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surprised, therefore, that the supreme effort required to achieve the
</EM><BR>
Apollo
<BR>
<EM>&gt; goals was followed by a period of retreat.  In the historical context of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post-Vietnam politics and economics and the slow, steady erosion of Soviet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power during the 70s and 80s, it seems all the more inevitable.  Thus,
</EM><BR>
Greg,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it is not the &quot;falling back from the dreams of the Apollo decades&quot; that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remarkable, it was Apollo itself that was remarkable.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think Greg should be apologetic at all for sharing that dream.  I'm
<BR>
a generation younger than him, yet I think it's still a good idea.  Granted,
<BR>
I'm not for government space programs at all, but private ones, YES!
<BR>
<P>Also, I don't think the whole space age dream failed -- if it even failed;
<BR>
wake up! there are both public and private space programs!:) -- because of
<BR>
anything inherent in technoprogress.  Rather, the culture changed.  After
<BR>
Apollo, sadly, people on the whole, from my readings (I'm too young to know
<BR>
firsthand, but perhaps some of the people who were adults back in the 1970s
<BR>
could fill me in -- and correct me if I'm wrong), became more critical of
<BR>
visionary technological programs.
<BR>
<P>Granted, most are hypocritical in their technophobia.  A coworker of mine
<BR>
recently gave me the typical line about humanity moving too fast toward the
<BR>
future.  He drives a brand new Toyota Supra with a spoiler and has a great
<BR>
stereo system onboard.  (Not to mention, he works in and loves IT.)  But
<BR>
this hypocrisy is not a good foundation to build dreams on.  It is great for
<BR>
nightmares, though.
<BR>
<P>Fortunately, though, the basic cultural optimism still flows forth.  A lot
<BR>
of people in my generation (X) and younger are interested in technology and
<BR>
the space industry.  So there, Greg Bear!:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  A lot of people--many of them friends--are working hard to lower costs
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  orbit. NEO is already a proven money maker for some. But as Joe Carroll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  pointed out, we haven't done the complete closed loop habitat
</EM><BR>
experiments
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  necessary to convince anybody that we can survive for a couple of years
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  space without help from Earth. This is the biological equivalent of
</EM><BR>
cutting
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  lose from suppliers of venture capital; breaking even, paying off
</EM><BR>
debts, or
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  making a profit!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree, and the &quot;GNR technologies&quot; (to borrow Bill Joy's term) are the
</EM><BR>
key
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to solving this problem, as well as the CAtS (Cheap Access to Space)
</EM><BR>
problem.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Just as a number of technological innovations and a base level of
</EM><BR>
economic
<BR>
<EM>&gt; prosperity in Europe made exploration and settlement of the New World
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible (the square-rigged sale and the compass on the technological side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the post-Black Death, Renaissance crop rotation and urbanization on
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; economic side), so genetic engineering, nanotechnology and robotics will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; create the background and tool-set for really exploiting the resources of
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; solar system.  The truth is that 20th century technology just wasn't up to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the job.  Mid-21st century technology will be.
</EM><BR>
<P>Though I agree GNR will help make CAtS better, if we just took that old
<BR>
Saturn V design, which, if I'm right, is now unpatented, we could be making
<BR>
disposable launch vehicles that could put huge cargoes in orbit NOW!  We'd
<BR>
be using a proven technology.
<BR>
<P>I also don't agree with the self-sustained model Greg Bear and others buy
<BR>
into.  The fist European colonies in the New World were not self-sustaining.
<BR>
People in Antarctica live for long periods without be totally
<BR>
self-sufficient.  Etc.  Surely, living in space is more extreme than these,
<BR>
but if you can get oxygen from Moon rocks or asteroids, there's no need for
<BR>
a perfectly closed ecosystem.
<BR>
<P>The model we should be focusing on is open systems and looking for ways to
<BR>
get resources to pump into them cheaply.  This way, we don't need to do all
<BR>
kinds of fancy development, testing, and extensive monitoring after
<BR>
deployment.  I'd rather have spare air tanks than rely on an intricate
<BR>
ecosystem to keep me breathing.  (Surely, one could have both, but I think
<BR>
all of you get my point.:)
<BR>
<P>My two cents!
