<EM>&gt; Spike asked:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Upon closer examination, Adam's altar stones were found to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contain...fossils. [doooooh!]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [john grigg has] heard alot of things, but never that story!...
</EM><BR>
<P>Got off my lazy ass and looked it up, found this, on page 311 of
<BR>
the very authoritative volume titled The Creationists: the Evolution
<BR>
of Scientific Creationism by Ron Numbers:
<BR>
<P>[James Talmadge] had personally inspected a pile of stones at
<BR>
Spring Hill, Missouri, declared by Joseph Smith to be part of the
<BR>
altar on which Adam offered sacrifices, and had seen that it
<BR>
contained fossilized animals.  &quot;If those stones be part of the first
<BR>
altar,&quot; he reasoned, &quot;Adam built it of stones containing corpses,
<BR>
and therefore death must have prevailed in the earth before
<BR>
Adam's time.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The article goes on to tell of U of Utah's Melvin A. Cook, Ph.D
<BR>
in chemistry who championed creationism and promoted the notion
<BR>
that radiocarbon dating could be telescoped down to about 13K yrs.
<BR>
He was an explosives expert and eventually won the Nitro Nobel
<BR>
Gold Medal, awarded for outstanding contribution to the field of
<BR>
explosives, for his invention of water-gel slurry explosives.  This
<BR>
gave the creationists their own (Nitro) Nobel laureate.  spike
