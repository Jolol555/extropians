<EM>&gt; &gt;most if

<EM>&gt; &gt;tightest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;gun control laws in the world, the SAS couldn't outgun the IRA. With one

<EM>&gt; &gt;of the

<EM>&gt; &gt;of War for that matter, depending on which way you want to take the argument),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they couldn't hunt down and erase even a fraction of the enemy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The rest of your post seemed valid but this paragraph surprised me. I doubt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the IRA are able to out gun the SAS in the context of fighting an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equivalent battle. The IRA are regarded as terrorists and so will be fought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; within the rule of appropriate law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If Britain were to regard the IRA as a legitimate army, I'm sure a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them would die, very rapidly, most likely with a fair ammount of collateral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damage (to use that odious phrase).
</EM><BR>
<P>If the British regarded the IRA as a legitimate army, you'd have British officers
<BR>
being brought up on war crimes charges, and they'd never beat the IRA. Conventional
<BR>
techniques are incapable of winning against native insurgencies. Insurgents win by
<BR>
merely continuing to exist until the oppressors get tired of the expense and go
<BR>
away, opressors can only win if the insurgents are wiped out to the last man and
<BR>
the remaining population is happy with their new leaders/owners.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, within British law, they're regarded as an in-between (terrorists)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which means that various normal criminal/human rights are waivered.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, they cannot be killed/attacked in an offensive manner, well at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public level, that is. At a covert level, it sometimes appears to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different story, but only the govnerment/spooks/victims know the true story
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there.
</EM><BR>
<P>The SAS troops in Ireland had one mission and one mission only: to kill, with
<BR>
extreme prejudice, any IRA partisans they got ahold of. The SAS is not a unit you
<BR>
use for police work, and only in intelligence work if you don't mind using torture
<BR>
and mutilation as a standard interviewing technique.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In Britain, everyone I've ever met wants peace. But start discussing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detail and the viewpoints diverge dramatically.
</EM><BR>
<P>Everybody wants peace. Some are willing to compromise to acheive it, others will
<BR>
only accept peace on their terms, some have the idea that peace means the other guy
<BR>
is put back in his place of subservience, and some will only accept peace if the
<BR>
other guys are dead and buried.
