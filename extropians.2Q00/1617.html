<EM>&gt; &gt; As for myself, a Catholic Scottish American whose family got relocated to Nova
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Scotia from the Gordon's Highlands, I've got little or no sympathies for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; headaches the Protestant British have brought on themselves, while at the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; time I have no sympathies for the marxist ideology of most IRA members. Frankly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you deserve each other.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who is this &quot;you&quot; you're talking about, white man? I'm a Jewish Brit of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Polish descent who lives in Scotland and votes for Scottish independence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at every opportunity.
</EM><BR>
<P>'You' as  in the British (Ulster specifically or British as a nation to a lesser
<BR>
extent). It was not pointed to you as an individual, as the context does not deal
<BR>
with you as an individual. Perhaps if I said 'They'?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And if you'd bothered reading up on the field you might have come across
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the interesting statistic that something like 85% of the GB population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; favours pulling the GB out of NI and letting the buggers kill each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other ... stereotyping people by attributing the foreign policy of their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government to them as personal opinion isn't exactly a good way of figuring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out what's going on anywhere, is it? Or would you like me to blame you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for Janet Reno's actions on the grounds that, being American, you must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; logically support her?
</EM><BR>
<P>Its well understood that the PM's government is hamstrung by the Ulsterites much like
<BR>
the Republicans are hamstrung by the fundamentalist anti-abortionists (or the Cuban
<BR>
Americans, for that matter, in the present situation). However, contrary to your
<BR>
statement above, you said earlier that most people didn't want to pull the British
<BR>
Army out because they figure it would turn into another Kosovo in no time. Which is
<BR>
it?
