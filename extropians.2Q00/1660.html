<EM>&gt; out of curiosity, and i do apologize for the brevity of this message, does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extropianism allow for the human mind to evolve beyond logic/rationalism?
</EM><BR>
<P>Define logic/rationalism.  It's theoretically possible that augmented
<BR>
minds might discover principles of philosophy that would make practical
<BR>
logic, as used by said minds, unrecognizable to us as we are today.
<BR>
But pondering such possibilities would not seem to be of use to us,
<BR>
since we have no guarantee that they would, nor have we any basis on
<BR>
which to compare replacements that, by definition, we can not conceive
<BR>
of.  (This is in contrast to that which we can conceive of - like
<BR>
nanotech, artificial duplicates of basically human sentience that is
<BR>
accelerated/has more memory/can juggle more data points at once - and
<BR>
even those point to a possible &quot;Singularity&quot;: a point in time beyond
<BR>
which we, as we are now, can not meaningfully relate to what will be.
<BR>
Evolving beyond logic/rationality would probably be an event that could
<BR>
define such a point in time.)
