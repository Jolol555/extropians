Offers potential for those in wheelchairs
<BR>
By Brad Evenson  May 1,2000 National Post
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope has arrived for the world's 98-pound weaklings,
<BR>
says a Canadian researcher who has found a way to
<BR>
flick the cellular switch that produces muscles.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We will now have the ability to make more muscle
<BR>
when we want it and where we need it,&quot; said Dr. Judy
<BR>
Anderson, a muscle cell biologist at the University of
<BR>
Manitoba.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Anderson says the research can also be applied
<BR>
to disease treatment, ageing, agriculture, sports medicine
<BR>
and even space travel.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, the only way to boost muscle growth was
<BR>
through disease or by injury.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Weightlifting, for example, creates many micro-injuries
<BR>
that cause a muscle to grow as the tissue is repaired.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Muscle cells are long, cigar-shaped tubes that go
<BR>
between tendons,&quot; Dr. Anderson explains.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When something goes wrong in a muscle cell, it sends
<BR>
nitric oxide to so-called satellite cells just above the muscle
<BR>
fiber, which sparks a muscle-growth process.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We haven't known how to turn on these satellite cells
<BR>
before,&quot; Dr. Anderson says.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now that we do, we have the potential to optimize muscle
<BR>
repair for those who use wheelchairs or others who are not
<BR>
able to exercise and maintain regular movement.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nitric oxide can be released in many ways, such as
<BR>
stretching muscles, or through muscle and nerve damage.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In some diseases, such as muscular dystrophy, this
<BR>
nitric oxide signal is disrupted, so that muscle tissue
<BR>
wastes away over time.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a study published in the journal Molecular Biology
<BR>
of the Cell, Dr. Anderson shows how certain compounds
<BR>
can stimulate the amount of nitric oxide that muscles release.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let me tell you, we've got mice that are on these compounds
<BR>
that are bigger, stroger and their satellite cells are activated,&quot;
<BR>
she says.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;After only a week, there's a major difference in what their
<BR>
muscles are doing. I don't know if we've got Arnold
<BR>
[Schwarzeneggers], but we've got big changes for sure.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Anderson sees the first applications of the procedure in
<BR>
rehabilitative medicine.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You could say, 'Well, I'm going for surgery. I need the muscle
<BR>
as busy as it can be as soon as that can happen. So I'm going
<BR>
to activate those cells now, just before surgery, and I need
<BR>
those repairs faster.' Or let's say you've had a stroke and you
<BR>
want your rehabilitation to go really well, so you could actually
<BR>
maintain muscle mass through this mechanism while you were
<BR>
allowing your nervous system to repair from this stroke.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The technique also has applications for ordinary ageing.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After age 30, muscle mass begins to dwindle in most adults.
<BR>
This causes a loss of &quot;pull&quot; on bones, which leads to osteoporosis,
<BR>
the loss of bone density. Similarly, the weightless environment of
<BR>
space travel is understood to decrease muscle mass, even
<BR>
when astronauts do plenty of exercise.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One of the things that we're going to be testing is how that will
<BR>
augment meat production in agriculture,&quot; says Dr. Anderson.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nitric oxide is something that all species have, so I expect that
<BR>
fish, chickens and all kinds of things could be affected.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While Olympic athletes and bodybuilders will no doubt be
<BR>
interested, Dr. Anderson says this technology can also be
<BR>
used to test for illegal muscle-building drug use. &quot;There's a
<BR>
possibility to turn this around another way and use it as a
<BR>
screening tool,&quot; she says.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stimulating nitric oxide is a superior technique to steroids
<BR>
and other compounds, she says, because it is the body's
<BR>
natural muscle-growth system and it is specific.
