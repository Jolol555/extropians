<P>On a personal note, which is of very limited generality: there are other

reasons for liking life in Australia, and I don't know that it would make
<BR>
much difference to me as a book writer, since my books get offered in the
<BR>
first instance to US publishers anyway through a US literary agent. Maybe
<BR>
I'd pick up more lucrative book reviewing work for the NY Times or
<BR>
somethun, but I doubt that such work would enable me to live there as well
<BR>
for as little toil as staying home does. But if I were living in a
<BR>
dirt-poor country and working with computers, say, and could find a way to
<BR>
get that Green card, of course I'd be there in a flash.
