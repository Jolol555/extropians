</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've always been annoyed by Jackson Pollock's paintings, not so much by his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work as by the high respect paid to it by university art teachers. I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;say what went on in the man's mind when he was creating one of his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;paintings, but the results resemble a house-painter's well-used drop cloth.
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you ever admired the pattern of rust spots on a junked car, or a 
<BR>
certain sunset or cloud formation, or layout of wood knots on a table? For 
<BR>
me, abstract expressionism has the same kind of appeal. It *would* have the 
<BR>
exact same appeal even if it were just a house-painter's well-used drop 
<BR>
cloth. Leonardo Da Vinci remarked that he admired the patterns of urine 
<BR>
stains and spittle on some wall near where he lived.
<BR>
I agree with you about the respect paid to Pollock by art experts. Pollock 
<BR>
was not a genius by virtue of his paintings. Chimps and elephants have been 
<BR>
trained to paint similar pictures (the Buffalo zoo sells elephant paintings 
<BR>
to raise money). The standard criticism that &quot;a five year old could paint 
<BR>
that&quot; is true, but I don't think it matters as far as value of the work's 
<BR>
visual and decorative appeal. The only thing I can think of that made 
<BR>
Pollock different from a five year old doing the same picture is that he 
<BR>
made it so that his works were perceived as high art. That was probably due 
<BR>
more to his critics and collectors then to him.
