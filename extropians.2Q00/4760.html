<P>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
<BR>
and New York University report in the June 6 issue of the Proceedings of the 
<BR>
National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) that they have made a biomaterial that 
<BR>
supports living nerve cells. 
<BR>
<P>This peptide-based scaffold, on which neurons grow fibers to communicate with 
<BR>
each other and establish functional synapses, may be the long-sought ideal 
<BR>
medium for growing replacement nerve cells for victims of spinal cord 
<BR>
injuries and other forms of nerve damage. 
<BR>
<P>New biological materials based on the tiny protein linkages called peptides 
<BR>
&quot;will become increasingly important in developing approaches for a wide range 
<BR>
of innovative medical technologies, including controlled drug release, new 
<BR>
scaffolds for cell-based therapies, tissue engineering and 
<BR>
biomineralization,&quot; predict authors Shuguang Zhang, associate director of the 
<BR>
Center for Biomedical Engineering at MIT; Todd C. Holmes (MIT PhD, 1994), 
<BR>
assistant professor of biology at NYU; and colleagues. 
<BR>
<P>This is the first peptide-based biomaterial of its kind that can be designed 
<BR>
at the molecular level. Although parts of animal cells such as collagen can 
<BR>
be extracted as a basis for growing cells, such animal-derived materials may 
<BR>
carry and pass on viruses to the attached growing cells. In contrast, the new 
<BR>
peptide-based material is not extracted from animal cells. 
<BR>
<P>And unlike other synthetic materials, these peptides are completely 
<BR>
biological. The peptides are composed of amino acids, which are the building 
<BR>
blocks of all proteins. The peptides do not evoke an immune response or 
<BR>
inflammation in living animals, and they can be used for a variety of 
<BR>
applications. &quot;The reason this material is so interesting and unique is that 
<BR>
we can individually tailor it to grow virtually every type of cell in the 
<BR>
body,&quot; Zhang said. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Further development of biological materials and related cell-based therapies 
<BR>
may bring us closer to the elusive goal of repairing the damaged nervous 
<BR>
system,&quot; wrote Melitta Schachner, a researcher in molecular neurobiology at 
<BR>
the University of Hamburg in Germany. Schachner wrote a &quot;News and Views&quot; 
<BR>
article about this work in the journal Nature. 
<BR>
<P>REGENERATING THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD 
<BR>
<P>Researchers are working to develop new biologically compatible scaffolds for 
<BR>
controlled drug release, tissue repair and tissue engineering. 
<BR>
<P>Synthetic scaffolds have been used to grow skin, livers and cartilage, among 
<BR>
other tissues, but some cells can't tolerate these scaffolds, which tend to 
<BR>
be acidic. 
<BR>
<P>While a successful scaffold has to be cell-friendly, it has to be 
<BR>
particularly hospitable to grow nerve cells. The brain seems to keep firm 
<BR>
control on the reproduction of its cells. Inhibitor molecules block 
<BR>
regenerating neurons. Neurons grown on the wrong substrate die. After an 
<BR>
initial period of development at the very beginning of life, very few new 
<BR>
neurons are produced by the adult central nervous system. 
<BR>
<P>The new biomaterial developed by Zhang, Holmes and colleagues seems to be an 
<BR>
ideal substrate, or growing surface, for cells slated for replacing damaged 
<BR>
tissue in the nervous system. Neurons attach to it and grow axons, the long 
<BR>
tails through which they send signals. Active synapses -- the spaces through 
<BR>
which nerve cells communicate -- form and survive in these cultured cells. 
<BR>
<P>SMART LEGOS 
<BR>
<P>Fragments of the 80,000-plus of kinds proteins in our body are called 
<BR>
peptides. Peptides transform themselves like tiny smart Legos into millions 
<BR>
of essential substances. 
<BR>
<P>Zhang and other scientists have recently discovered that these same peptides 
<BR>
can be tweaked into forming completely new natural materials that may be able 
<BR>
to perform a variety of useful functions inside and outside the body. 
<BR>
<P>Researchers have found that peptides can self-assemble into non-protein-like 
<BR>
structures such as fibers, tubules, sheets and thin layers. They can be made 
<BR>
responsive to changes in acidity, mechanical forces, temperature, pressure, 
<BR>
electrical and magnetic fields and light. They are stable at temperatures up 
<BR>
to 350 degrees Celsius and can be produced up to a ton at a time at 
<BR>
affordable cost. They can be programmed to biodegrade. 
<BR>
<P>Out of scientific curiosity, Zhang asked Holmes to test one of his 
<BR>
self-assembling peptides for toxicity to nerve cells. Not only were they not 
<BR>
toxic, they seemed to thrive in culture in the presence of a salt. With the 
<BR>
salt, the peptides self-assembled into thin, wavy films that look a little 
<BR>
like Saran Wrap. Under a microscope, the film contained a network of fibers. 
<BR>
<P>Further tests showed that nerve cells happily grew on these fibers. While no 
<BR>
immune response or inflammation was seen when the peptides were injected into 
<BR>
rat muscle tissue, they have not yet tested in the brain, spinal cord and 
<BR>
peripheral nerves.

<BR>
Biomedical Engineering at MIT.
