<EM>&gt;  I have never said that transparency will be fun.  I have said that it is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  coming whether we like it or not.  I have also said that, on the whole, it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  will be beneficial to society.  No, I don't want you to see me doing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  embarrassing things.  But if *everyone* is subject to the same degree of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  intrusion, I will suffer it and I will not complain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Transparency needs to viewed not only from our standpoint, but 
<BR>
also from the view of future generations. I would find it highly intrusive if 
<BR>
anyone could watch me going about doing some of my natural bodily functions. 
<BR>
If someone was born into a transparent world, they wouldn't think twice about 
<BR>
sitting on the toilet and talking to complete stranger over a video phone. Or 
<BR>
taking a shower and waving to a passer-by through the sheet glass walls. If I 
<BR>
could step forward into a society where people are not only unbothered by the 
<BR>
hang ups that we hold so dear but couldn't even comprehend them. I think it 
<BR>
would be a liberating experience.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is our discomfort of the transitional period really too great a price to 
<BR>
pay ?.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Similarly, I *hate* paying income taxes.  I bust my butt everyday for my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  money, not Uncle Sam.  Every year I write a big fat check to the 
</EM><BR>
government 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  and I feel like I am being raped.  But I realize that everyone else is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  getting raped as well, and at least my rapist uses the money to buy things 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that benefit me, like highways, infrastructure and hundreds of thousands 
</EM><BR>
of 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  people with guns to protect my family and me from the likes of Saddam 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Hussein.  Do I like it?  No.  Can I put up with it?  In light of all the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  circumstances, yes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could always move to &quot;Nearly Heaven&quot;. Im not sure what the residents 
<BR>
would make of an Extropian. They would probably shoot us as &quot;New World Order&quot; 
<BR>
spies.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex.
