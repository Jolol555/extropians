<EM>&gt; &gt;The only protection offered against illegitimate use of deadly force in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the U.S. is to kill the state agents/police at the time the incident
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;occurs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Murder is *already* a capital offense, even if you are wearing a cop uniform 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the time you commit the murder.  So I assume what you are suggesting is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some sort of summary execution which bypasses the jury trial process, right? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   That sounds like a really great plan.  Oh, except for the minor detail 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that *no one in their right mind would become a cop*. I'm amazed that they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can hire people as cops now to get paid marginally well to risk their lives 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every working hour of the day.  And now, in addition to getting reprimanded, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspended, fired and sued for making an error, you think they should be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *killed* too?  Yeah, sure I might take that job...if it paid $10 million a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; year.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>This is legal *now*, and always has been; I wasn't making a suggestion.  It
<BR>
is considered self-defense if you kill a cop executing illegal force,
<BR>
whether the use of illegal force is accidental or intentional.  The moment
<BR>
someone threatens lethal force against you without correct legal
<BR>
authority, they become fair game in the eyes of the law whether or not
<BR>
they come under the color of authority.
<BR>
<P>Please note the importance of making sure the police are bearing correct
<BR>
legal authority; if they are, one cannot legitimately resist them. 
<BR>
However, if they kick in the door of the wrong address, a violent response
<BR>
is justified even if they have a warrant for that address as the warrant
<BR>
is effectively invalidated by being incorrect.  The courts have ruled
<BR>
repeatedly that killing police while they are threatening lethal force on
<BR>
an illegal or invalid pretext is to be considered justifiable homicide. 
<BR>
There are rules about where the lines are drawn, but the priniciple stands
<BR>
on its own.
<BR>
<P>It appears that you find the lives of police to be more important than the
<BR>
inconvenience of having the police actually make sure they are not killing
<BR>
innocent people.  I don't see how you can so easily grant the authority to
<BR>
kill without making the same individuals fully responsible for their use
<BR>
of that authority.  I think it is a good thing that screwing up grave
<BR>
decisions have grave consequences.
