Hi!

<EM>&gt;I don't get this reference.  Are you talking about lifetime vs. one-time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reproduction in salmon?
</EM><BR>
<P>For instance. Salmon's aging phenotype (amongst other iteroparous species)
<BR>
is a good example of a very simple mechanism (and I'm certain you can't
<BR>
tell me of a species with a very complex mechanism of aging; even if they
<BR>
exist, none are known).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Alleles which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;combine several systems together are much more difficult to evolve;
</EM><BR>
<P>The body is an integrated collection of connected systems. If the immune
<BR>
system degenerates with aging, the other systems will also be affected.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There *are* thousands of pathologies.  The phenetic variability of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aging is a problem for *your* theory; you're the one claiming we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all have the same aging system.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not a problem for my theory: since senescence affects the entire body
<BR>
and all systems this leads to a large variety of pathologies. I was merely
<BR>
pointing that the evolution of thousands of your proposed pathologies is
<BR>
difficult (Strehler in 1986, Mechanisms of Aging . . . I believe does some
<BR>
thinking about this).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;(5) despite what I said in (1), in mammals that is not true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You've got to make up your mind here.  If similarity of aging is evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for your theory, variability (1) is evidence against it, and vice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;versa.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really. Variability (1) is more likely to occur with simple aging
<BR>
mechanisms. However, uniformity amongst a single phylum is also what is
<BR>
expected assuming the causes of aging are the same for all species. You
<BR>
see, it's two different phenomena: In (1) it is a comparison of different
<BR>
causes of aging while in (5) it is a comparison between species that age
<BR>
for the same reason.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;No; the simple explanation is that *everything* goes wrong.  Mammals are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all biologically very similar; they have the same things to go wrong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Non-replaceables wear out; proliferation slows, impairing repair,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and cancer becomes more common.  These are all very straightfoward.
</EM><BR>
<P>But how do you explain that they occur in mice after 3 years and in humans
<BR>
after 60? Something is the timekeeper of these events. You can say it's the
<BR>
normal developmental program or whatever but something is controlling all
<BR>
these events; they are not independant of one another.
<BR>
<P>I actually forgot another reason. If you are right and I'm wrong then every
<BR>
single age-related pathology is independant (one gene for each pathology,
<BR>
with, you might say, some exceptions). So how do you explain Werner's or
<BR>
Hutchinson-Gilford's syndromes? Even if you don't think they are cases of
<BR>
accelerated aging (which you'll obviously have to be ready to defend),
<BR>
people with these diseases develop about 50% of all aging phenotypes (50%
<BR>
of age-related pathologies you claim are independant). As you know,
<BR>
Werner's syndrome is caused by one single gene. This alone rules out the
<BR>
possibility that all age-related pathologies cannot have an upstream
<BR>
regulator. In addition, it also provides strong evidence that other simple
<BR>
(probably not with just one gene but a few more) mechanisms can be upstream
<BR>
of most, if not all, aging pathologies. Finally, it demonstrates that
<BR>
age-related pathologies do not develop independently and do not originate
<BR>
in different genes (although other genes can affect their expression).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;He needs to read the literature: there have been many demonstrations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of antagonistic pleiotropy.  Offhand, I can recall Rose's and Partridge's;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there are many, many others.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you mention them (particullarly in humans)? I couldn't find that many.
<BR>
So far, I've got Lithgow, Rose, Partridge, Johnson, Austad, and Walker. In
<BR>
humans all I've got is Hutchinson's disease increasing fertility.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;He doesn't mention that an aging population will be far less fit just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because it has a higher death rate.  If the situation is dire to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;point a non-aging population can barely make it, the aging population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will have negative growth due to the extra mortality, and will go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extinct.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good point. I discussed with Bowles a few months ago his article and I
<BR>
don't agree with all his ideas. However, I think he mentions a few
<BR>
interesting points regarding how aging can be advantageous in certain
<BR>
circumstances.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;P.S. I'm not knocking Medical Hypotheses; there's a role for such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;journals.  It's just that things published there aren't really evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for anything.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think there is a place for theoretical biology. In fact, I think there
<BR>
should be more theoretical journals in biology. Physics, for example, has
<BR>
many more people just working on theories. I think it's a pity that in
<BR>
biology that doesn't happen; most biologists have to associate lab work
<BR>
with thinking; which means the time biologists spend thinking is not as big
<BR>
as physicists. That's probably why, on average, physicists are more
<BR>
intelligent than biologists (taken from &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;).
<BR>
<P>Best wishes.
