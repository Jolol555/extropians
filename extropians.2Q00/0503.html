<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; Believe it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  or not, the government of the United States of America urged the various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that had been Standard Oil to &quot;pool&quot; some of the resources and cooperate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; among
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  themselves more than they had in order to increase production and lower the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of oil.This is pitiful! I'm tempted to make some wise cracks at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  expense but it almost seems in bad taste, sort of like making fun of a blind
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thank you, John,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     You have told us something that needs to be told over and over not only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the Standard Oil situation but about many others as well.  I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lurked listening to this discussion and often wondered what would happen if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bill Gates moved his headquarters and his jobs out of the US and into anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a number of countries where he would be welcomed with open arms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I have often reflected also on what it is in the soul of a collectivist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that so so hates the very guts of a capable individual.  I have no answer but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that we should not too gleefully point out the foibles of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collectivist mind or make too fun of them regardless of how much they deserve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it; it just &quot;ain't&quot; sporting.
</EM><BR>
<P>There was a letter in this month's Freedom magazine from a person
<BR>
speculating a whatif that Bill Gates would duplicate the feat of the
<BR>
owner of the copper mines in Atlas Shrugged, who destroyed all of his
<BR>
mines rather than let the government seize them. When I read this, I
<BR>
wondered rather, if Gates one-upped John Galt and removed his company
<BR>
from US territory, possibly buying some island somewhere and develop it
<BR>
as a programmers paradise for his 10,000-20,000 employee/shareholders.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, Gates is heavily infected with the democrat meme, thanks
<BR>
to his mother, and despite his best competetive abilities. I doubt that
<BR>
the guy who gave $90,000 to a gun control lobbying group in Washington
<BR>
State, and who appears at the White House to kiss up to slick willie so
<BR>
soon after getting spanked by the S&amp;M crew of Uncle Sugar, actually has
<BR>
the cojones to pull of such a feat.
