<EM>&gt; I have undertaken a LBYM (live below your means) lifestyle for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; last several months, and would like to sing it's praises.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I recently finished Thomas Stanley's &quot;The Millionare Next Door&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;The Millionare Mind&quot;. Both books deal with his extensive research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on millionares, who they are and how they got there. His main point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that the vast majority got there in this lifetime, on their own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They stay married to the same person for life, and they are very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pragmatic about spending money. They are not at all what we have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come to expect via the media.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I strongly recommend reading both of these books.  These books are as
<BR>
important, if not more, than similar types of books on investing.  They
<BR>
offer extraordinarily valuable insight into what factors actually account
<BR>
for why some people becine wealthy and some do not.  Most people don't realize that rampant consumerism
<BR>
nickel-and-dimes them into a state of chronic non-affluence, never mind
<BR>
the detrimental effects it can have on mind and body.
<BR>
<P>Coincidentally, I finished &quot;The Millionaire Mind&quot; yesterday (inflight
<BR>
reading material for a trip I returned from yesterday).  I also found it
<BR>
interesting how much the average millionaire lifestyle actually deviates
<BR>
from the image held by most people.  I'd previously read other articles by
<BR>
T. Stanley and have generally been impressed with his research.  I was
<BR>
also happy to see that my lifestyle fits the profile relatively well
<BR>
(though I am not a millionaire, I hope to be), which is admittedly why I
<BR>
bought the book in the first place -- lifestyle improvement.  
<BR>
<P>After trying other lifestyles on for size, I pretty much made a long-term
<BR>
commitment to the LBYM lifestyle, largely because it offers so many
<BR>
benefits in addition to wealth building (like reduced stress) with very few
<BR>
consequences.  In fact, there are a lot of things about cheap lifestyles
<BR>
that are generally superior to high consumption ones.
<BR>
<P>I have lived below my means for some time, largely because I've developed
<BR>
cheap lifestyle habits as a consequence of being poor for so many years. 
<BR>
Over the years, I *have* noticed a difference between myself and my
<BR>
friends, most of whom tend to support a consumption heavy lifestyle -- it
<BR>
is something we even talk about on occasion.  While the durable goods I
<BR>
buy do tend to be relatively expensive on average (I tend to pay for
<BR>
quality), I rarely buy things and I don't actually have that much stuff (my
<BR>
house is quite empty).  Most of the things I enjoy doing are cheap or
<BR>
free; I tend not to spend money on consumables and things that don't retain
<BR>
their value with few exceptions.  The net result is that while most of my
<BR>
friends are in the same general income situation as me, I have started to
<BR>
noticeably separate from the pack in terms of total assets.  In fact, I
<BR>
haven't sacrificed anything because I generally have as much &quot;nice stuff&quot;
<BR>
as they do, I just financed it differently, more carefully, and am
<BR>
generally patient when making capital purchases.
<BR>
<P>Anyhow, in the last 6 months or so I have re-doubled my efforts to be
<BR>
economically efficient and have managed to do pretty well at reducing the
<BR>
expenses of my household without any loss in quality of life.  I think
<BR>
that our expenses are currently at around 35-40% of our take-home
<BR>
income, including expenses such as mortgages, rent, and
<BR>
similar.  Most of the rest gets invested in stocks and maybe real estate. 
<BR>
Investment appreciation aside, it is amazing how fast one can accumulate
<BR>
money simply through aggressive saving.  The biggest savings have come
<BR>
from eliminating debt and leading a cash driven lifestyle (something easy
<BR>
to do when you spend considerably less than your income).  Heavy use of
<BR>
credit can have enormous negative consequences on long-term wealth
<BR>
building.
<BR>
<P>Living below your means is a good topic.
