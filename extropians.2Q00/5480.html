-----altamira is alleged to have uttered the following;
<BR>
<P><P>&lt;quote&gt;
<BR>
I can't claim to have visited many 3rd world countries, but I've spent some
<BR>
time in Mexico. I've noticed 2 major causes of poverty there.  One is the
<BR>
Catholic church which discourages the use of contraceptives and abortion.
<BR>
The second is the behavior of people who hold positions of power in various
<BR>
governmental and corporate entities.
<BR>
<P>When you buy bananas at the grocery store, odds are they came from land that
<BR>
was once occupied by people who grew enough food, fiber, and fuel crops on
<BR>
the land to take care of themselves.  Business corporations, acting in
<BR>
conjunction with the Mexican (and sometimes the U.S.) government, took over
<BR>
the land and gave the people who'd been using it the option of leaving or
<BR>
staying there and working for the corporation at very low wages, which they
<BR>
would use to buy exorbitantly priced food at the grocery store (likely also
<BR>
owned by the corporation). The more self-respecting of the disposssed
<BR>
peasants go to seek their fortunes in the city.  The lucky ones have friends
<BR>
in the U.S. who can help them find work (if they can make it safely across
<BR>
the border and get past the check points). Others live on the outskirts of
<BR>
cities such as Mexico D.F.
<BR>
<P>This is the ugly side of capitalism.
<BR>
<P>&lt;end quote&gt;
<BR>
<P>I take exception to the last sentence.  I don't call a &quot;protection racket&quot;
<BR>
capitalism.  What is the deference between the above scenario (where a
<BR>
corporation engages in acts of extortion with government backing) and that
<BR>
of a local thug extortion shopkeepers with union boss/policitcal machine
<BR>
boss approval?  The only difference I see is scale.
<BR>
<P>I agree and accept what you said...but don't call it capitalism.
