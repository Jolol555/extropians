<EM>&gt; Although I tend toward the &quot;bleeding heart&quot; end of the spectrum, I look at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capital punishment as a cost vs. benefit analysis.  You got a human scum 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (say, Charlie Manson) who has amply demonstrated that he will never be good 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for anything except warming a prison cell.  Do we keep him alive for no good 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason until he wastes away, at a cost of umpteen thousand dollars per year, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or do we put him and us out of our mutual misery by killing and cremating 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him at a cost of a few thousand and be done with it?  The answer to me seems 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obvious.

<P>Unless you take into account the possibility that he might be innocent
<BR>
but wrongly convicted. Here in the UK, they've tightened up the appeals
<BR>
and miscarriages-of-justice process a bit in the past few years, and
<BR>
added DNA testing to the battery of forensic techniques available.
<BR>
The result is that roughly 10-15% of historic &quot;guilty&quot; verdicts are
<BR>
being overturned, in crimes as serious as murder.
<BR>
<P>Face it, the judicial system is a system created by human beings. As
<BR>
such, it is fallible -- even without side-issues like police corruption
<BR>
and political interference.
<BR>
<P>Think of that nice warm prison cell Charlie Manson sleeps in every night
<BR>
as YOUR personal insurance premium against being summarily executed for
<BR>
a crime you didn't commit.
