<EM>&gt; I use Win 98, 95, and NT systems, and have little problems with them as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operating systems. MY NT 4.0 systems run for weeks if I want them too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problems I have with windows is not the OS, but the applications.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many applications do a very very poor job of memory management,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resulting in memory leakage, and the filling of your RAM and swap file
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with garbage to the point that the application crashes, or it causes the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OS to crash. Applications I've had the most difficulty with are: Word
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perfect, Netscape, and Ventura. I now avoid WP like the plague, though I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to use Ventura for my work, and it has gotten better with version 8
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sp 2 than anything previous.
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite so.
<BR>
<P>However, memory leakage and application crashes should not bring down
<BR>
the entire OS. If they are capable of doing so, that is a critical
<BR>
problem with the OS itself. There is no reason they should be able to do
<BR>
this other than poor programming in the OS.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have found that most crashes on Win systems are not due to the OS, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because inexpensive hardware is used. I use intel chips and standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intel motherboards, matrox video cards (S3 Virge is satanspawn), etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You do get what you pay for.
</EM><BR>
<P>Michael, unless you are suggesting there is actual corruption of data
<BR>
occuring in these devices this doesn't hold up. You misinterpret the
<BR>
cause of the problem; it is not the hardware, but the drivers (though
<BR>
there may be correlation with inexpensive hardware and poorly written
<BR>
drivers). And we refer, of course, to the Windows drivers. S3 Virge
<BR>
cards, as it happens, are some of the *most* stable under the latest
<BR>
versions of XFree86 on Linux, whilst other cards (often, in fact, the
<BR>
expensive ones, especially when the manufacturers refuse to release
<BR>
specifications - see nVidia) have less solid drivers and are more prone
<BR>
to crashes.
