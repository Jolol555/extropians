The result of a move to a high-unemployment post-nano society is going to be 
<BR>
a massive surge in social disorder, mental illness, and any number of other 
<BR>
undesirable things -- unless we do something to mop up the labour pool of 
<BR>
un-retrainables by giving them something to do that makes them feel needed. 
<BR>
And I figure nanotech near-anything boxes are likely to show up a bit before 
<BR>
intelligence augmentation techniques, and be much more socially acceptable, 
<BR>
so we can't simply turn our unretrainables into retrainable geniuses.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Charlie, this is a very interesting scenario.  And if near-anything boxes 
<BR>
are very expensive or simply not allowed into the hands of the public, then 
<BR>
you will not have unemployed people &quot;living like kings!&quot;  We could see a gap 
<BR>
between rich and poor like the world has never seen before.  This could 
<BR>
certainly lead to an explosion in mental illness and violence in society.
<BR>
<P>Of course, with near-anything boxes, the gov't could easily take care of the 
<BR>
basic needs of the unemployed but the psychological dissatisfaction of 
<BR>
living in such a state when others in society are thriving unbelievably 
<BR>
could still cause great social dissension.
<BR>
<P>I think the vast bulk of unemployed would be retrainable, especially with 
<BR>
the computer hardware and software cheaply available to teach these people.  
<BR>
It would take time though, and real effort on the part of the unemployed.  
<BR>
It could be seen later on as sort of a &quot;renaissance period&quot;
<BR>
where people went back to school in droves, sort of like the time after WW2 
<BR>
with the G.I. bill as droves of men filled the universities.
<BR>
<P>Now, if near-anything boxes were fairly inexpensive and available to the 
<BR>
public, then this period of unemployment would be rather interesting!  We 
<BR>
would see a new breed of &quot;prosperous unemployed&quot; who would have lots of time 
<BR>
on their hands but would have more then decent housing, transportation, food 
<BR>
and clothing due to their near-anything box and perhaps a small gov't dole.  
<BR>
And hopefully good medical care would also be available to them.  I don't 
<BR>
know if adequate health care could come from a near-anything box!  maybe?
<BR>
<P>I would think some people could actually blossom under these conditions and 
<BR>
find new interests, vocations and pursuits.  I think most of us here sure 
<BR>
could! lol  But others who are used to more regimented lives might fall into 
<BR>
a cycle of mental illness, violence and general indolence due to prosperity 
<BR>
without the absolute necessity of work.
<BR>
<P>The sins and vices of the poor would be among the trappings of the 
<BR>
present-day upper middle-class, at least materially.  I have visited the 
<BR>
homes of people in the ghetto, including welfare moms, and wonder if they 
<BR>
would exploit this condition to improve themselves or burn themselves out in 
<BR>
a blaze of partying and violence?  How would any of us respond?
<BR>
