<EM>&gt; &gt; Gee Whillikers, Spike, you use kitchen arithmetic better'n... well, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can't say that, on account of the little'uns....

<P><EM>&gt; Wow thanks, Mike.  With that introduction, I will mention that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we do in fact have an extropians GIMPS team, sort of.  Recall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from a few months ago that GIMPS is an organized effort to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; search for enormous prime numbers, and Mersenne primes are a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; special class of primes, of the form 2^n-1, such that they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a shortcut to determining their primeness.  This shortcut allows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the determination of primeness to be dozens of orders of magnitude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faster than ordinary factoring.  [Now theres a phrase one seldom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hears: dozens of orders of magnitude.]
</EM><BR>
<P>Dooooooh!  I cant believe I made such a comical error.  In order
<BR>
to prove the primeness of the largest known prime number
<BR>
[as of 1 June 1999] would require on the order of 10^1,000,000
<BR>
divides, since the largest known prime number has well over 2 million
<BR>
decimal digits.  Then it matters not if one uses Newtons method
<BR>
or any of the sieves, or any other shortcut, for these might at
<BR>
best knock off a few or maybe even a few dozen orders of magnitude,
<BR>
but what matter is that, when we speak of 10^1,000,000?  So
<BR>
the Lucal Lehmer shortcut for determining primeness of a
<BR>
Mersenne prime is shorter than factoring by over a million
<BR>
orders of magnitude.  And it matters not if that Lucas Lehmer
<BR>
takes a nanosecond, a year or a lifetime, these all being within
<BR>
what, 20 orders of magnitude of the same?  The ratio is *still*
<BR>
way over a million orders of magnitude.
<BR>
<P>On a sobering note, it was Sasha Chislenko who got around to
<BR>
actually setting up the extropians GIMPS team.  I tried to do it
<BR>
about a year ago but evidently did something wrong.  I noticed
<BR>
in the GIMPS archives that it was Sasha that actually managed
<BR>
to make it happen.  If you want to join the extropians GIMPS
<BR>
team, Go to the site and follow the directions.
<BR>
<P>If I can figure out what I was doing wrong before,
<BR>
I intend to donate my 6 processor years of Mersenne prime
<BR>
searching to the extropian GIMPS team in honor of the memory
<BR>
of Sasha, the mathematician.
