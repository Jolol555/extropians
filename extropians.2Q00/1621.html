<EM>&gt; Mike,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     You referred several times to the disruptions in the form of unemployment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of workers caused by new technology.  I agree with you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     This also raises one issue that continues to puzzle me.  We live in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Capitalist society and enjoy its benefits yet most high school graduates and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not all college graduates ever take a course in economics.  Further our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; workers of all classes seem unaware that our lives are likely to get caught
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up in one of these disruptions.  We seem to have no idea that we need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consider how to protect ourselves against these disruptions.  Why is that?
</EM><BR>
<P>Good question. There was an economics course in my high school in the mid 80's.
<BR>
Micro/macro economics are pretty standard freshman/sophomore economics courses
<BR>
for most college majors.
<BR>
<P>I'd love to say that you don't see economics theory in high schools because the
<BR>
NEA is a bunch of tree hugging socialist liberal / feminazi weenies who think
<BR>
that capitalism is merely the power structure by which the white anglo-male
<BR>
minority maintains its aristo-phallocracy, but that is likely to cause a few
<BR>
inflamed hemorrhoids among the few list members with similar sympathies....8^P
<BR>
So assume I didn't say that.... &lt;VBG&gt;
<BR>
<P>On a positive note, continuing education seems to be becoming a pretty standard
<BR>
practice for most people to maintain skills as their careers develop with
<BR>
technology.
