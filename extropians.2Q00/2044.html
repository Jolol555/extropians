Well, my original T-Shirt says &quot;Singularity 2005&quot;, but since it's been a 
<BR>
couple of years since that T-Shirt was created, and work hasn't really 
<BR>
started yet, I'd be pretty surprised if the job got done before2006-2007. 
<BR>
2010 is still a good possibility - it's the target date I'd try for if I had 
<BR>
a well-funded Singularity Institute. (Though I'd make it clear that the 
<BR>
project might extend to 2015, 2020, or beyond.)After all, ten years is over 
<BR>
three hundred megaseconds. A lot can happen in three hundred million 
<BR>
seconds.

<P>Very true.  Eliezer, maybe Sasha's company could take a look at your AI seed 
<BR>
project???  Who knows?  Just a thought for a friend.
<BR>
<P>With the imagination you have, perhaps an informal business could be started 
<BR>
with you as the creative force behind a series of t-shirts, caps and 
<BR>
miscellaneous items?  This could be the perfect format for you to make some 
<BR>
decent(or even impressive money) and spread direct and indirect 
<BR>
singularitarian memes.  Maybe you and Greg's brother-in-law in some sort of 
<BR>
partnership as time goes by?
<BR>
<P>Anyway, best of luck to you in your desire to come up with a first class 
<BR>
T-shirt.  I would like to purchase some if they are ever available 
<BR>
commercially, for my younger brother, bestfriend and myself.  See, you 
<BR>
already have a customer! :)
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John
