<BR>
<P><EM>       &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>       &gt;&gt; how can the &quot;old guy&quot; be dead when you remember being him?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;How can Jesus be dead when people claim to be him?
</EM><BR>
<P>Claims are a dime a dozen, Jesus is dead because nobody remembers
<BR>
being him.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;The viewpoint of the new body would never match
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt; that of the original Harvey Newstrom unless its original memory is erased
</EM><BR>
<P>The new brain was just made, it has no memories except the ones I choose to
<BR>
put in. I choose to put in your memories, that's why he's you.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; and replaced with false memories matching the originals.
</EM><BR>
<P>They are not false, they are your memories.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; All you have created is an external facade that looks the same as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;original.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's much more than a facade, I have created a condition where neither
<BR>
the most subtle experiments of science nor subjective experience can
<BR>
tell any difference, any difference at all. I conclude this is because there
<BR>
is no difference.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;The viewpoint or experience of the original Harvey Newstrom never
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; transfers to the new body.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well something certainly transfers. I could have done it yesterday to you
<BR>
and you'd never be able to tell the difference. I could have done it a billion
<BR>
times a second from the day you were born and it wouldn't matter a hill of
<BR>
beans to you or any of your friends. Perhaps it actually has happened.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; What makes me &quot;me&quot; in my definition is my viewpoint of being &quot;here&quot;.  I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; not perceive that something acting like me over &quot;there&quot; can be me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Two points:
<BR>
<P>1) You don't know where you are you only know where your sense inputs are.
<BR>
<P>2) I think  Leibniz's idea  of  the Identity Of Indiscernibles is quite reasonable,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's the idea that if you exchange the position of two things and there
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is no change in the system then the two things are the same. If I place
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you and the original an equal distance from the center of a symmetrical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room so you see the same things and then instantly swap your brain
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the other then neither you or the original or any outside observer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could detect the slightest change.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>    &gt;Why does  your plan for transferring consciousness depend on killing me
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;instead of convincing me of the plans' success.
</EM><BR>
<P>Because otherwise it wouldn't work. After about a second the two would start
<BR>
to diverge, that's why I said I would only be happy in being &quot;killed&quot; if a copy of
<BR>
me was made right now.
