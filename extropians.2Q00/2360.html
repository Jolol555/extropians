Dolly Parton-what a breath of fresh air!  It's pleasantly ironic to know she
<BR>
has &quot;transhuman&quot; qualities-if not by the various augmentations,
<BR>
modifications and upgrading of her human form, than certainly in her humor:
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I never thought of Dolly Parton as having transhuman qualities! Very interesting.  I have always enjoyed her sense of humor.  Now, can we get her signed up for cryonics? lol  I think of Cher as also being very transhuman in the sense that she fights to retain her youthful appearance through diet and surgery.  
<BR>
<P>Your post made me wonder what music award shows will be like let's say... eighty years from now!  Self-deprecating humor will be used to poke fun at a stars desire to automorph their total appearance on a regular basis.  Marilyn Manson would envy what  his counterpart in the year 2080 could do!  
<BR>
<P>I can just imagine it if we had the technology now, parents would hear cries like, &quot;Mom, can I have the gene mod package deal to look like Shania Twain?&quot;  &quot;All my friends are doing it!&quot;  &quot;And you let my brother get the living dead zombie gene mod to fit in with his pals!&quot;    
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
