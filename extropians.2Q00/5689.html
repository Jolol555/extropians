<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, though I rarely have the time to skim through all the masses of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; e-mails that go around this list, this one got my attention because of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact, that someone draws false conclusions out of obvious facts:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Washington DC also has one of the most restrictive gun laws in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the country. Name any other high crime city in the US, and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; will find a city with extremely restrictive gun laws.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That seems to be true. As I do not live in the US, I would not try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question this, though I read some foreign newspapers. But Washington is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; renowned for its criminals even in Germany.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; As I've said before, almost everyone I have known personally that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; has visited europe has been robbed at least once while they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; there, they've had their hotel rooms robbed, their cars broken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; into or stolen, and bags snatched out of their hands.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That might be true, but then I wonder what places all these people have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; visited. I live in Europe for almost thirty years now and I wasn't robbed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; till now. Most people I know haven't been victims to anything more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps burglary. By the way, I cannot not think of any method to secure my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; car by means of wepaonry than to fix some claymore mines to it - and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would certainly exceed any reasonable use of force.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, there is a nice system that originated in South Africa that
<BR>
consists of some short duration flame throwers that shoot up from under
<BR>
the rocker panel, covering the doors on both sides of the vehicles.
<BR>
Supposedly very effective in deterring and preventing carjackings.
<BR>
<P>The way to secure your car most cheaply is to live where so many law
<BR>
abiding people are armed that a car thief is more likely to be
<BR>
apprehended by an armed civilian than to escape with the vehicle or its
<BR>
contents. Where I live most people don't even have to lock their cars.
<BR>
The concept of the security of one's private property is part and parcel
<BR>
of one's right to personal security. Its understood that your countries
<BR>
suffer from a higher percentage of five fingered socialists, always
<BR>
willing to redistribute your stuff to themselves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; The brazenness of theives in europe to me is incredible, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; testament to the fact that they know there is little a person can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; do to defend themselves against robbery in europe. I've heard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; many stories of women mugged and raped with bystanders just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; walking by, ignoring what went on. Non-gun crime is so prevalent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; I believe that most people there just don't see it, or refuse to see it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would certainly not want to live in a state where it is legal to shoot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone who is only a thief. That would mean to equal the worth of the human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life with that of property which seems inadequate. 
</EM><BR>
<P>What is your life worth when your life savings and property have been
<BR>
destroyed or stolen? A person who would steal the product of your labor
<BR>
is stealing your time, is stealing your life, is enslaving and killing
<BR>
you. Just because the theif only takes a small portion of your life
<BR>
makes him no less a killer than one who takes your entire life at once.
<BR>
Lets say a pickpocket steals my insulin kit, and I'm visiting a city in
<BR>
europe where few people around speak english to a degree to understand
<BR>
my needs as a diabetic. I go into insulin shock and die. Should the
<BR>
thief be charged with murder, or just for petty theft? He only stole
<BR>
maybe $100 worth of medical equipment and drugs. Thats not much. But it
<BR>
was the difference between life and death for me. Even if I reach
<BR>
medical attention in time to save my life, the toxic shock has
<BR>
irreversibly shortened my life, so years of my life have been stolen,
<BR>
not just a mere $100 worth of medical equipment, and my life was
<BR>
threatened. Lets say I pull my legally owned pistol when the pickpocket
<BR>
grabs my medical kit, and hold him at gun point. I can justifiably say
<BR>
my life was threatened, can't I? Was ALL of my life threatened, or just
<BR>
part of it? Which part? The part represented by the $100 invested in the
<BR>
insulin kit? Or the possible years taken off the end of my life by
<BR>
insulin shock? Or would it be the entire remainder of my life if I could
<BR>
have died?
<BR>
<P>Frankly, I don't have to worry about it here in New Hampshire. It says
<BR>
right there in the state constitution that I have the right to defend
<BR>
myself, my family, my property, and the state. One of the things I
<BR>
really like about this state.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But this theory can also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work the other way round, which is the case in Germany: Three friends of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mine were playing cards on the balcony of their appartment when they heard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the desperate cries of a woman. They rushed to rescue her and found a man
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to rape a young girl. Luckily they arrived in time and gave the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criminal the beating of his life. After that, they called the police. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criminal sued them for severe injury. In the end, the criminal was sentenced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less hard than those who had helped the victim. And that is definitely not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just!
</EM><BR>
<P>Very much so. There are places here like that, very socialist states
<BR>
like Massachusetts, where such idiocy is allowed to be considered common
<BR>
jurisprudence.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; It bothers me that my father who lives in New York City and is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; former courier who carried a sidearm cannot now do so.  But he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; does live right next door to a large NYPD precinct house! lol  He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; likes to eat lunch at a local bar &amp; grill with a group of friends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; who are homicide detectives and share with him some juicy stories
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; over food.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; New York City and Washington D.C. are two places where lawful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; citizens should absolutely be allowed to easily get permits to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; carry a sidearm.  Would it lower the victimization rates I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; wonder?  It might also cause criminals to &quot;raise the bar&quot; to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; new level of viciousness but, so be it.  I don't feel the need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; carry a handgun in Anchorage but if I were visiting the big apple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; I would sure want one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is one fact. In Europe, possession of arms is restricted. But the &quot;bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guys&quot; also have limited weapons. If you would allow anyone to carry weapons,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then the bad guys will certainly carry them. Although I would have prefered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have a gun as long as I lived in Frankfurt, I doubt that it would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done any good. If you are unarmed, well, you can get beaten up or robbed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Okay. If you are armed, you get shot. Okay, if you are a combat-trained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gunslinger, you might be able to shoot them, but most people aren't. So this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is no big defense. The bad guys usually have more guns, more firepower and,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ost important, the least problems of using them.
</EM><BR>
<P>The 'bad guys' in europe have all the weapons they want. The bad guys
<BR>
carry them whether law abiding people have them or not. If a criminal is
<BR>
so bold as to decide to take your life in defiance of the law against
<BR>
murder, what makes you think a little thing like a weapons law will keep
<BR>
him from getting a gun. BTW: I've always wanted to ask a German this:
<BR>
How does it feel to still be living under laws drafted under the Nazi
<BR>
regeime?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Weapons do no harm. It's the people who use them. Most of the people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have guns neve use them. At least not on other people. Even most criminals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would not deliberately use excessive force to achieve their goal. If all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people have guns, the criminal is forced to use maximum force to achieve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their goal without danger for themselves. The problem of liberal gun laws is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the tendency to use them will increase.
</EM><BR>
<P>No. you are very wrong there. States here that have liberal gun laws
<BR>
have shown very little use in crime. It is in states and cities that
<BR>
have very restrictive gun laws where most gun crime occurs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; I have heard stories of severe thievery in Europe and on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; sophisticated level that dates back centuries.  I did not know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; they suffered from apathy when it comes to intervening in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; situations such as an ongoing rape.  I know that has happened in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the United States.  What parts of Europe are you talking about?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, that is indeed a problem. A 17 year old girl was raped in Hamburg, by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; day (!) and in a crowded local train (!!). I do not understand hos something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like this can happen in my country. Though I made the shocking experience
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that this is common in this country, though rarely in such an extreme case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most violations are never reported due to the shame of the victims, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; makes it only worse. The problem here is not guns but simply the way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking. As long as this does not change, the way people behave will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change.
</EM><BR>
<P>That way of thinking is the thinking of well conditioned sheep. Any
<BR>
society that would convict good samaritans deserves the crime it gets.
<BR>
We had similar problems here in the states in the 1960s and 1970's,
<BR>
where criminals would sue people who apprehended them, and police and
<BR>
prosecutors would convict good samaritans. Finally people got sick of it
<BR>
and got the legislature to pass good samaritan laws, and they formed
<BR>
neighborhood watch groups, like the Guardian Angels.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If we look at the overall facts, crimes like burglary or robbery might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more frequent in Europe. But definitely the rate of murder and other capital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crimes is much higher in the US. If faced with the choice, I would always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prefer Europe. Property can be restored, that's why we have insurances. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no insurance can give you back your life.
</EM><BR>
<P>You yourself pay for the property to be restored, since you pay much
<BR>
higher insurance premiums than I do. In the meantime, some of your life
<BR>
has been stolen, just as sure as if it had been killed off with a knife
<BR>
or a pistol...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Like the Romans said: Ab igne ignem. - Out of the fire - fire.
</EM><BR>
<P>They also said &quot;come home with your shield, or on it.&quot; Stand like a
<BR>
Roman against the barbarians and fight and win, or fight and die, or
<BR>
don't come home at all. In the Roman Republic, only the serfs, the
<BR>
slaves, were disarmed. Now you want us all to be slaves?
