<EM>&gt;Windows is not incapable of priviledge levels or access restrictions. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is merely installed by the typical user without any. That is a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;laziness rather than lack of capability. Any proper and secure ActiveX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;installation should allow you to set up such security (which would also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alleviate a lot of the other security holes typical of windows use to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;access the internet.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, lets say you create a runtime to run ActiveX on a linux/unix
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;environment. Because that environment specifically allows priviledge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;levels and access restrictions, you can build this capability into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;runtime, such that it can interpret an ActiveX applet as being a user,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;group, or world level of access, and ban root from executing ActiveX.
</EM><BR>
<P>The point I'm making is that ActiveX has a security model based on
<BR>
trust and authentication, rather than by restricting what an applet is
<BR>
able to do. This was a conscious and deliberate design decision, and
<BR>
Microsoft has never pretended otherwise or represented ActiveX
<BR>
security as analogous to Java sandboxing. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From Microsoft's 'Facts about ActiveX' at
</EM><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/actxclar.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/actxclar.asp</A>:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Software can be designed to provide great value and improve
<BR>
productivity. But it can also be used to create malicious programs
<BR>
that can do harm. As with any versatile technology, there are
<BR>
important trade-offs to understand about software downloaded from the
<BR>
Internet.  Building a program with the utopian &quot;guaranteed&quot;
<BR>
security that Sun promises from the Java sandbox would also severely
<BR>
limit the functionality of the application, thereby crippling the
<BR>
developer's creativity and limiting the user's options.  (The sandbox
<BR>
is an environment where Java applets run. Applets running in a sandbox
<BR>
have very limited functionality because they cannot access resources
<BR>
on the user's system.) Imagine, for example, a check-writing
<BR>
application that couldn't even save files to your disk but instead
<BR>
required you to re-enter the information each time you wrote a check.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;The only way to provide users with both the most positive computing
<BR>
experience and maximum security is to adopt a model based on trust. A
<BR>
trust model identifies the certified provider of a program and then
<BR>
allows users to decide for themselves whether to trust that provider.
<BR>
This model allows developers to create the most innovative
<BR>
applications, and allows users to realize the full potential of their
<BR>
computers while still maintaining an appropriate level of security.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Certainly an executable can be sandboxed as effectively as bytecode,
<BR>
given sufficient operating system support. But that isn't the way ActiveX
<BR>
works, or the way it was ever intended to work. I come down on the other side
<BR>
of that particular design decision - in my view 'trust' requires eternal
<BR>
vigilance, the cost of which in practice is indifference. How many times a day
<BR>
do you click away the 'Anyone could read what you just typed' box while dealing
<BR>
with forms? Have you ever refused anyone's authentication certificate? Now, of
<BR>
course, I have only myself to blame if something gets though - but I don't find
<BR>
that a particularly great comfort.
