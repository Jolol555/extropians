<EM>&gt; &gt; Anyone who is bored by such discussion, just remember that your future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wearables/surgical implants may very well run an MS or MS derived OS,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At the moment, I do find this quite unlikely. I'm active on some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the wearable lists, and have my own construction in progress (minus the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; display, for now).
</EM><BR>
<P>Which lists would be good for a wearable-wannabe like myself? I'm not much
<BR>
of a hardware junky... I just want to be a robot. Too much Doctor Who when I
<BR>
was a littlun. I saw the cybermen, and thought &quot;Now there's a plan...&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Seriously, I've been more motivated recently to check out wearables, and
<BR>
would love some pointers to lists.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The vast majority of efforts in progress are using Linux or other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unices, since MS systems don't posess the flexibility to move
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to that environment. Which is not to say, of course, that MS could not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produce software for wearables - but I imagine by the time they take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any steps in that direction other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But there are also ideas about doing something completely new - the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current thread on wear-hard is a discussion of the possibilities of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using custom code on Z80 derivatives... maybe some old skills coming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back to life here :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Excellent. I recently took my first step in mobile computing, getting myself
<BR>
a notebook. I can't overstate what a difference it has made to my life!!!
<BR>
However, notebooks have their limitations; they are still so removed.
<BR>
Wearable computing is the way to go. I have no doubt that it is the way of
<BR>
the (near) future; I want a piece of the action!
<BR>
<P>Completely off topic, my personal continuing investigation of COM (MS
<BR>
architecture for bits of programs to talk to each other) has led to the
<BR>
interesting information that Linux now has COM, which the Kylix project
<BR>
(Delphi on Linux, a Borland/Inprise project) will use to make Delphi work on
<BR>
Linux, and make Delphi code portable between Windows and Linux (I imagine
<BR>
with severe restrictions). More interesting than that is the very real idea
<BR>
that a heterogeneous network of Linux &amp; Windows machines can have programs
<BR>
communicating via COM (more correctly DCOM), which is really a very high
<BR>
level communications architecture. So some really hardcore interoperability
<BR>
between Linux and Windows is becoming available.
<BR>
<P>So this Linux vs Windows stuff... should we all just kiss and make up? I'm
<BR>
using the dark side of the force, in case you haven't noticed.
