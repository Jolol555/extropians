<EM>&gt; Dear Damien: Either the rest of the Bay area extropians have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uploaded or the house prices were too high and they moved way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are no more Bay area extropians. Sorry.  Amara

<EM>&gt; (hey, wasn't there an extropians social event there during that weekend?)
</EM><BR>
<P>They reloaded (?) to attended the event at the Cafe Bombay.  How
<BR>
many were there,  I think about 40 of us.  We filled a really long table (~20)
<BR>
and then two other tables for 8 each and another 4 top.  The management
<BR>
musta thought us a really wacky bunch, but we had fun.
<BR>
<P>As for house prices, yes that is really going crazy these days.
<BR>
I get flyers in the mail every other day begging me to sell my house.
<BR>
I think a lotta people (not just extropians) realize that these past 5
<BR>
years are the calm before the storm.  There are so many new
<BR>
innovations coming so soon it boggles the mind of anyone who
<BR>
has one.  {8-]  spike
