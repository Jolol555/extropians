<EM>&gt; all the other dignitaries, it was all a huge elaborate April Fools
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gag.  Bunch of us nerds showed up, some weasley undergrad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; April Fooled us, told us we were all skepticism challenged, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; escaped before we could lynch him.  spike

<P>Ha Ha, Spike, lol.
<BR>
<P>Actually, it was great to see the folks I had been reading for so long,
<BR>
in the flesh (while we still have some).  As expected, many more folks
<BR>
showed up than the facility could support, and that made things
<BR>
uncomfortable.  Problems with the microphones did not help, either.
<BR>
<P>A great deal of time was spent talking about each person's area of
<BR>
interest, until Kelly got up and said he was going to talk about the
<BR>
actual question put forth by Bill Joy.  Bill himself, looked rather
<BR>
unhappy through the whole afternoon, and was a bit more negative with
<BR>
this group.  I think he felt we could take it.  Folks got very quiet
<BR>
when he put forth a vision of a 21st century of man made pestilence.
<BR>
One important thing he told us was that the main stream media are
<BR>
calling him up and asking for longer and longer interviews; it is now up
<BR>
to 20 min.
<BR>
<P>Hofstadter admitted that he had stacked the panel by not asking anyone
<BR>
from the anti-technology movement (Bill made up that whole side).  Ralph
<BR>
did what he could to push the idea that nanotech could be developed
<BR>
safely, but only a small part of the audience seemed to know what he was
<BR>
talking about.
<BR>
<P>I think most of the concepts discussed would not be considered
<BR>
too advanced by the folks on this list, but it was quite a lot for a
<BR>
public meeting.  Hofstadter said the topic he really wanted was &quot;Who
<BR>
will be we in 2100?&quot;, and the discussion got interesting when Hans
<BR>
started talking philosophy of identity.
<BR>
<P>All and all, I was very glad I went, and expect this to be the start of
<BR>
much more of the same.  I am interested to hear how others on this list
<BR>
saw it.
<BR>
