<P>&lt;&lt; I can imagine this imparted energy modulation or *transmission* 
<BR>
&nbsp;propergating like ripples accross the world. One question that has stuck in 
<BR>
&nbsp;my mind is If this collective unconscious does exist, why are there no 
<BR>
&nbsp;animals that have perfected this comunication. After all surely such an 
<BR>
&nbsp;animal would have little problem surviving, finding food would be easy, just 
<BR>
&nbsp;read the mind of a fellow animal of your species that has found food and go 
<BR>
&nbsp;to where they are. You would know where the preditors were etc etc. Perhaps 
<BR>
&nbsp;this ability is only a recent evolutionary event and only becoming minutely 
<BR>
&nbsp;apparent in the most complex brains on the planet. Maybe it has contributed 
<BR>
&nbsp;to the success of mankind ?.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course as you can see my belief in this link is based on very little 
<BR>
&nbsp;evidence and can easily be argued, but I still think there is something in 
<BR>
it 
<BR>
&nbsp;and to be honest the more I learn and think about it , the more I tend to 
<BR>
&nbsp;re-enforce my belief.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Alex, expect em' to buts your chops on this list for holding such an opinion. 
<BR>
I am not sure I personally buy into it because to quote American Engineer, 
<BR>
Vanevar Bush, the validity of a science is its ability to predict. I am not 
<BR>
sure how you'd be able to predict anything that is to come.  On the other 
<BR>
hand the notion of  uncovering hidden things, patterns, ideas, and the like 
<BR>
can, at least, be traced back to Plato. Carl Jung also dealt with this as 
<BR>
you're well aware of, but despite his brilliance, his involvement with Nordic 
<BR>
Mysticism, seems a bit 'round the bend' for me. Biologist Rupert Sheldrake 
<BR>
has taken a lot of heat for his 'morphic patterning' he claims to have 
<BR>
discovered in nature. So you might want to look up his works to see if it 
<BR>
fits what you are experiencing.
<BR>
<P>Best of Luck, Mitch
