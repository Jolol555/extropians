Subject: More on Ayn Rand in Russia
<BR>
<P><P>I'm sure that by now most of you know that Ayn Rand's novels have been
<BR>
published in Russia and that the newly appointed economic advisor to the
<BR>
President, Andrei Illarionov, has been powerfully influenced by ATLAS
<BR>
SHRUGGED, stating publicly that its philosophy is the only solution to
<BR>
Russia's desperate economic problems. Perhaps you do not know that President
<BR>
Putin, too, has a copy of ATLAS in his personal library--in the Kremlin. It
<BR>
was sent to him by Andrei Illarionov and by a man named Dimitry Kostuguine.
<BR>
<P>Dimitry, a young Russian, has dedicated six years of his life to the
<BR>
translation of WE THE LIVING, THE FOUNTAINHEAD, and ATLAS. They were first
<BR>
published in St. Petersburg, and more recently in Moscow.
<BR>
<P>Glenn Cripe, a good friend of mine, spent years raising the money so that
<BR>
Dmitry could do the necessary translating, etc., to have these books and
<BR>
others published in Russia. He helped Dmitry to learn everything involved in
<BR>
publishing and publicizing.  Glenn traveled back and forth to Russia a
<BR>
number of times, providing for Dmitry such miracles as a computer, enough
<BR>
money for
<BR>
work space, etc. A wonderful story Glenn told me is that he and Dimitry
<BR>
arranged to have the news of the publication of, I think THE FOUNTAINHEAD,
<BR>
blared over the sound system of the St. Petersburg train station--the same
<BR>
station where Lenin arrived to start the Communist Revolution, the same
<BR>
station where Ayn Rand left St. Petersburg to go to America. What an
<BR>
incredible story it all is!
<BR>
<P>I'm sure some of you will wish to congratulate Dimitry and Glenn. Dimitry's
<BR>
email is dk@aynrand.ru. Glenn's email is glenncripe@yahoo.com.
<BR>
<P>You will be interested to know that at present two representatives of the
<BR>
Cato Institute are in Moscow, conferring with Andrei Illarionov.
