<EM>&gt; &gt; As I have stated, the fact is that the only version of linux that is anywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; near being as easy to install as windows [snip] is the Corel release
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a subjective judgement. Personally I find it the *hardest*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why, just because I wanted to argue my &quot;it's subjective&quot; point?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, because the install simply fails to work on many machines.
</EM><BR>
<P>Please specify such machines.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (and thus the only one qualified to be price compared for similar value)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm afraid I fail to understand this logic. When did we suddenly decide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the installation procedure (something most consumers never deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with anyway!) was the important factor in the value of an OS?
</EM><BR>
<P>How easy it is for their computer tech to install determines what they
<BR>
pay for their computer, right????
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; argument, which I contested Judge Jackson's claim that consumers were harmed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; having to pay more for Windows (and thus any OS) than they should have had to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This aspect of the case was dealing with preinstalled copies of Windows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that the Linux installation programs are not as easy as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Windows ones. But the vast majority of users have never installed any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operating system themselves, and would also have difficulty with that of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Windows.
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the things most people have to do at least once themselves is
<BR>
RE-install windows. With linux users, how many times do people recompile
<BR>
their kernel?
