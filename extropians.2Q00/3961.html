<P>
It just occurred to me that I've been very rude in posting to this list
<BR>
without first introducing myself.
<BR>
<P>I subscribed to the list initially because the name extropian appealed to me
<BR>
in the same way as the idea of multi-directional time travel. I've lurked
<BR>
around for a while, fascinated by the many topics discussed and also the
<BR>
sense of humor.  The fruits-are-nuts thread was great!
<BR>
<P>I don't know what my IQ is, but I've taken tests, many years ago.  I
<BR>
remember being told that I was eligible to join some group called the Three
<BR>
Sigma Club or something like that.  I never looked into it, but I got the
<BR>
impression it was sort of like Mensa except more elitest.  You had to have
<BR>
an IQ 3 standard deviations above the mean. I don't know whether such a club
<BR>
actually exists.
<BR>
<P>Six years ago I took up a forager/low-key horticultural lifestyle so that I
<BR>
could study, read, and write what I was interested in without having to
<BR>
worry about making more than enough money to buy a few toys I occassionally
<BR>
want, like computer equipment, photovoltaics. I live in a house I built from
<BR>
homemade adobe bricks. I've had great fun devising a water-delivery system,
<BR>
electrical system, and so forth.  I find the lifestyle to be quite pleasant,
<BR>
and the garden, woods, and fields themselves are endless sources of wonder
<BR>
(as are city streets, alleys, and vacant lots, for that matter).  I learn at
<BR>
least 5 or 6 new things each day in the garden and many more from reading.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From the latest neurological research I've read, this constant exposure to
</EM><BR>
new ideas should keep my mind agile into my old age. Most important as far
<BR>
as I'm concerned, I'm eager to get up and start each day, and I sleep well
<BR>
at night, and eat very well indeed.  The bit about agribusiness being
<BR>
necessary to feed the world and growing food requiring back-breaking labor
<BR>
are myths, nothing more--very potent myths, since food is such a basic
<BR>
necessity.
<BR>
<P>I think I'd rather have my memories transferred to a new body (or a machine)
<BR>
rather than keeping the one I have now indefinitely. It's not that the one I
<BR>
have now isn't a good one.  Everything on it works pretty well, except that
<BR>
its nasal sinuses get clogged up with snot when there are certain pollens,
<BR>
molds, &amp; stuff like that in the air.  But I think it would be far more
<BR>
interesting to have an assortment of bodies over the long haul than to be
<BR>
stuck with just one.
<BR>
<P>So, thank you for having me on your list. I have a web site, but I sort of
<BR>
doubt that anyone on this list would be interested in it. It's mostly about
<BR>
gardening, building cisterns, etc. But to complete my introduction, here's
