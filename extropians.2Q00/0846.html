<EM>&gt; &gt; Re ethics.  The pure benefit analysis just doesn't quite do the trick, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; really sorry to say (as explicated really nicely by Xerene and Strackon 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; late '60's Invictus article).  It provides plenty of reasons to look 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you're moral and to encourage other people to be moral, and it even 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rules
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; out casual dishonestly on the grounds of the additional mental 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; involved in lieing, as David Friedman discussed in an article in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Liberty,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but it doesn't address the professional criminal at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; On the other hand, the real reason most people are moral is that they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; visibility and emotional openness - something like the old, rarely-heard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; concept of honor.  They despise having to live a lie, hide 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;psychologically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like a rat, etc.  These costs - of living a criminal life - can be quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; devastating.  Check out &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley,&quot; if you haven't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;already.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And these aren't in one's long-term interest because...?  That, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;material benefits one can reap from it, would seem to address the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;professional criminal.
</EM><BR>
<P>My point was that the mere policy considerations - the chance of getting 
<BR>
caught, the additional mental processing, etc. - which are usually posed as 
<BR>
the reason for honesty as self-interest, are not in fact generally 
<BR>
sufficient in themselves.  There are many hasardous professions which offer 
<BR>
a subgroup of the population sufficient rewards to make it worth their while 
<BR>
- e.g., deep sea diving for oil rigs, with a 25% mortality per year.  Some 
<BR>
people are naturally better suited for these occupations and would tend to 
<BR>
engage in them and succeed, as in your smarter professional criminals, who 
<BR>
engage in multi-million-dollar scams and go their entire lives seen as 
<BR>
pillars of their communities.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, criminal behavior does have an additional unique cost, 
<BR>
which is that it cuts one off from normal uncensored interaction with other 
<BR>
conscious beings.  One has to constantly monitor the image one is 
<BR>
projecting, to make it correspond to something different from the real you, 
<BR>
or face the consequences of being found out as a criminal.  This has a 
<BR>
disasterous effect upon certain fundamental psychological and 
<BR>
psychoepistemological needs.  After all, what do people put more effort into 
<BR>
typically than their love lives?  For what are they more willing to take 
<BR>
major risks - or even sacrifice their own lives - than for their loved ones?
