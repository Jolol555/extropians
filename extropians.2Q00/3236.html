<P>Bankrupt satellite firm saved by cell phone pioneer 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Bloomberg News
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May 17, 2000, 12:10 p.m. PT 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LONDON--ICO Global Communications, a struggling satellite-telephone
<BR>
company, emerged from bankruptcy protection with plans to be run by cell
<BR>
phone pioneer Craig McCaw. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICO, based in London, is seeking a merger with McCaw's satellite
<BR>
company Teledesic to form ICO-Teledesic Global, a holding company that
<BR>
will control the satellite assets of McCaw's private investment company
<BR>
Eagle River Investments. McCaw will be chairman of the new company,
<BR>
Teledesic said. Russell Daggatt was named acting chief executive of ICO
<BR>
and ICO-Teledesic, replacing Richard Greco, who is resigning as CEO of
<BR>
ICO. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;ICO filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 in U.S.
<BR>
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., in August. It cited $2.5 billion
<BR>
in assets and $1.1 billion in debts after delaying $43 million in bond
<BR>
interest payments. ICO Global won a U.S. judge's approval May 3 for a
<BR>
bankruptcy plan of reorganization. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;McCaw and Indian TV network operator Subhash Chandra received court
<BR>
approval in December to buy ICO for about $1.2 billion. ICO said it's
<BR>
upgrading its satellite equipment to add wireless Internet and other
<BR>
data services. ICO was competing for business with rival satellite phone
<BR>
companies Globalstar Telecommunications of New York, and Iridium of
<BR>
Washington, which is also in bankruptcy court and ceased operations in
<BR>
mid-March. 
<BR>
<P>Teledesic had planned to offer high-speed Internet access anywhere in
<BR>
the world using 288 low-earth-orbiting satellites. It has raised about
<BR>
$1.5 billion from Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, Motorola, Saudi Prince
<BR>
Alwaleed bin Talal, Boeing and others as of September. Chandra will
<BR>
continue to be an investor, Teledesic said.
