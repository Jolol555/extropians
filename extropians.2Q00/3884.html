<EM>&gt; The National Center for Policy Analysis makes (march, 1999) the argument
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that guns contribute a significant benefit to society. Given the strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arguments deployed on both sides of the gun debate, an accurate cost &amp;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefit analysis would make a useful objective contribution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; STATS (april, 1999) took the National Center figures, re-worked them to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; include full long-term values and applied tests to see how sensitive the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data were to certain factors. Conclusions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *    If 2.5 million crimes are prevented each year by defensive gun use,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is a clear and substantial (over $1 billion) net benefit to society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the use of guns.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *    If civilians kill 3,000 criminals a year, there is a clear net benefit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *    If the Justice Department figure of 483,000 crimes per year committed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with guns is correct, there is a clear net benefit to society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *    However, if you accept the Justice Department figures for crimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevented and criminals killed, there is a clear and substantial net cost to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which most people acknowledge are baseless due to their disregard of
<BR>
most gun uses. Most defensive gun uses are not reported, or are
<BR>
unmentioned by local police in their reports, when the gun is not fired.
<BR>
Justice department figures only count instances where guns are fired.
<BR>
Defensive gun use involves far more than actual firing of firarms. I've
<BR>
known many people who have used their guns defensively by merely
<BR>
brandishing the gun, even in instances where the criminal was similarly
<BR>
armed because many times criminals cannot afford or legally cannot buy,
<BR>
ammunition for their guns.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; *    If a median figure for crimes prevented each year (764,000) is used,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then there is a clear net cost to society (from $33 million to over $1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; billion) unless over 2000 criminals are killed each year.
</EM><BR>
<P>However, they don't clearly delineate the difference between suicide
<BR>
(and whether suicide costs or benefits society. Cearly suicide
<BR>
eliminates any social security or other government entitlements for the
<BR>
normal period of retirement) and other gun violence. Since over half of
<BR>
homicides are actually suicides, this should have a significant impact
<BR>
on the calculations.
