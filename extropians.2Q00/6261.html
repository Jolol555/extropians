</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For a GOOD EFFIN' REASON!!!
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry Brian. Gotta say this. Then I'm unsubscribing.
<BR>
<P>Imagine Brian is a woman, Brianna.
<BR>
Imagine Natasha is a man, Nathan.
<BR>
Imagine Max is a woman, Maxine.
<BR>
<P>This really helps see what's happening with Max's machismo blow-up.
<BR>
<P>But some background is really needed too.
<BR>
<P>Go back a few months before the Extropy 4 conference. Brianna is hanging out 
<BR>
with her humanities friends in Oregon, who have been spending a lot of time 
<BR>
making fun of her for her interest in high tech thingies, and also for her 
<BR>
shift away from the political left.
<BR>
<P>Brianna says, Look, my politics are going to be individual, we can still be 
<BR>
friends.
<BR>
<P>Plus, these high tech people I've been emailing with are not as stupid as 
<BR>
you think. And they're willing to listen to new challenging ideas! I just 
<BR>
emailed Maxine More, also a philosopher by the way!!, about Erasmus and my 
<BR>
theses about how humanism relates to these so called transhumanisms and 
<BR>
posthumanisms. I've suggested some better ideas about how to understand 
<BR>
technology and humanism, using some terms from 19th century Romanticism 
<BR>
('ultrahumanism', 'uberhumanism' etc.).
<BR>
<P>(Fast Forward a few months.)
<BR>
<P>Brianna!, says one of Brianna's friends, Check out this web page. You're 
<BR>
right! Maxine *does* have an open mind. You apparently convinced her that 
<BR>
'transhumanism' and 'posthumanism' might be problematic terms. Her opening 
<BR>
speech is on just this issue! Well done! Maybe these people aren't as bad as 
<BR>
they sometimes look ('racist', 'misogynist', etc.).
<BR>
<P>Brianna says, Listen, why don't you join their list! We can get a discussion 
<BR>
going on some of these topics. Should be interesting! There are some *very* 
<BR>
interesting people on the list.
<BR>
<P>(Fast forward a week or so.)
<BR>
<P>Brianna's friends join the list. Brianna posts a treatise about 'humanism' 
<BR>
and 'transhumanism.' A discussion is started. It's very interesting indeed.
<BR>
<P>Then =&gt;
<BR>
<P>Brianna writes:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Hi Stan,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Yes -- more like &quot;the&quot; conference for this list, by the way. (For the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;record, he may, of course, have come up with the idea years before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;my email. Extropians are capable of independent thought, you'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;discover!)
</EM><BR>
<P>Maxine writes:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;For the record, I came us with &quot;ultrahuman&quot; several months ago, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thinking about my book and my talk for the conference. I was surprised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and amused to see your use of the term immediately before I first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;used the term publically at the conference (though it had been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the conference program for a while before that). This isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really surprising though. Several people have independently come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up with &quot;extropy&quot; and &quot;transhuman&quot; (or &quot;trans-human&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<P><P>'For the record' WHAT?!!!!
<BR>
<P>Okay, says Brianna to her friends - who are chuckling and saying 'come back 
<BR>
to the left,' 'come back to the humanities, remember Paulina Borsok' - Wait, 
<BR>
wait. A simple mistake. I'll just email Maxine, and have faith that she has 
<BR>
simply forgotten the older emails. Not a big deal anyway. The term itself 
<BR>
has been around for a long long time.
<BR>
<P>Maxine says she recalls the emails, then says, I'm leaving town for a few 
<BR>
days, I'll make te correction when I get back.
<BR>
<P>Brianna tells her friends, Just wait, she's a decent person, trust me, she 
<BR>
wouldn't leave me looking like I had made an absurd claim to originality 
<BR>
(and even suggest subtly that *I* stole the term from her!!!). I have faith.
<BR>
<P>A long time goes by. Zip from Maxine.
<BR>
<P>Brianna finally emails Maxine again, occasioned by some odd emails that 
<BR>
Brianna has been receiving about Maxine.
<BR>
<P>Maxine says, Oops, sorry, I honestly just forgot. I'll do it right away.
<BR>
<P>Brianna's friends are skeptical. Brianna again says, Listen, she's running a 
<BR>
very busy institute, cut her some slack. This time, for sure.
<BR>
<P>A long time goes by. Zip from Maxine yet *again*.
<BR>
<P>Brianna's friends say, So this is Extropian Ethics, eh?
<BR>
<P>Fast forward to June 2000.
<BR>
<P>Brianna, perhaps because she was treated badly in the past by Maxine, 
<BR>
perhaps for other reasons, makes a too sharply-worded comment about Maxine's 
<BR>
institute involving anti-Semitism.
<BR>
<P>Maxine reacts strongly.
<BR>
<P>Brianna corrects the comment.
<BR>
<P>Now we're ready for a discussion.
<BR>
<P>Nope, Maxine is in pure defense mode, not try to understand mode.
<BR>
<P>Brianna is angry, and hurt, and reacts accordingly.
<BR>
<P>......
<BR>
<P>Brianna eventually opens her heart about how badly she's been feeling about 
<BR>
something from the past, in order to help Maxine see a possible source of 
<BR>
her original statement.
<BR>
<P>In opening her heart she makes a rhetorical 'gesture' designed to show just 
<BR>
how nutty someone who has slandered Maxine really is ('..... the influence 
<BR>
of the psychotic asshole (Nathan's ex-girlfriend? I can't think of any other 
<BR>
reason...)')
<BR>
<P>Nathan misunderstands completely, in several ways, and reacts strongly to 
<BR>
Brianna.
<BR>
<P>Brianna is hurt, especially that Nathan would read her paragraph so 
<BR>
sloppily, despite feeling confident enough to accuse her bad faith.
<BR>
<P>But that's okay, Brianna realizes there was definitely room for 
<BR>
misunderstanding, so she corrects her mistake *immediately*, and now expects 
<BR>
the discussion to continue in good will.
<BR>
<P>Nope.
<BR>
<P>Eventually, after several instances of bad treatment, Nathan tells Brianna 
<BR>
that she isn't authentically working towards the Good.
<BR>
<P>Brianna loses control, fires off a few (mild, compared to what Nathan 
<BR>
deserves) comments.
<BR>
<P>Nathan then disappears.
<BR>
<P>*Maxine* then attacks Brianna!
<BR>
<P>Extropians join in!
<BR>
<P><P>Earth to Extropians: Anyone understand yet?
<BR>
<P><P>P.S. This way of looking at things was someone else's idea, for the record.
