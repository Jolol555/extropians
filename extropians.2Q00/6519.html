<P>
It seems that there will be a problem with the adoption of artificial
<BR>
wombs and other changes to the natural conception/birth process, because
<BR>
we won't know for a long time if there are bad effects.  This would slow
<BR>
down the adoption rate.
<BR>
<P>First you do it with animals, and if that seems to work, you try it
<BR>
on a few people.  Wait at least a decade, maybe more like 20 years,
<BR>
and make sure the children are OK and can reproduce OK.
<BR>
<P>Now that it seems to work, you can try it on somewhat larger numbers of
<BR>
people, and make sure that there are no rare side effects and problems.
<BR>
And so on, with gradually increasing numbers every 20 years or so.
<BR>
<P>It's not the kind of thing that can be adopted en masse in just a decade
<BR>
or two.  It sounds like it would take centuries before you could have
<BR>
widespread changeover.
<BR>
