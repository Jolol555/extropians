</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It seems that there will be a problem with the adoption of artificial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wombs and other changes to the natural conception/birth process, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we won't know for a long time if there are bad effects.  This would slow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;down the adoption rate.
</EM><BR>
<P>I dunno.. the benefits are so incredible that I would expect women to adopt 
<BR>
it even with a certain amount of risk. It negates what basically becomes a 
<BR>
disability, and an extremely painful and risky event. I also would expect 
<BR>
that, because it has a gender angle, it can be pushed as a feminist thing - 
<BR>
women will (rightfully) ask why men are making this decision when it's not 
<BR>
something they have to go through. Issues of freedom which have to do with 
<BR>
inequality are always pushed a lot harder then lacks of freedom which effect 
<BR>
everyone - this is why abortion is legal and marijuana is not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;First you do it with animals, and if that seems to work, you try it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on a few people.  Wait at least a decade, maybe more like 20 years,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and make sure the children are OK and can reproduce OK.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, hopefully they'd do it on animals first before they put it on the 
<BR>
market, just like with anything else.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now that it seems to work, you can try it on somewhat larger numbers of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people, and make sure that there are no rare side effects and problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And so on, with gradually increasing numbers every 20 years or so.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're speaking as if there would be some central entity making this 
<BR>
decision. If the FDA would approve it, there would be some early adopters - 
<BR>
mostly infertile women probably, and it might be originally hailed as an 
<BR>
infertility treatment - but I would expect it to go much faster then most 
<BR>
medical innovations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's not the kind of thing that can be adopted en masse in just a decade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or two.  It sounds like it would take centuries before you could have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;widespread changeover.
</EM><BR>
