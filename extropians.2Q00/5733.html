<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly I don't find immigration laws to be inhumane.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why are they a bad idea?...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...societies that produce excessive numbers of people should pay the

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm surprized at you, Michael.  Open borders are a bedrock of the free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; market economy, and a simple consequence of granting the same basic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; rights of free travel and association to those born on one side of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; imaginary line as we do to those born on the other.  Nationalism is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; unbecoming rational minds.  &quot;Excessive people&quot; are a resource to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; cherished, not a burden.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't look at it as a nationalist issue, its an economic AND ecological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Open borders for TRADE are a bedrock of a free market economy. The existing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;members of a free market economy should also have the ability to control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;quality of life in their communities. If people living elsewhere want a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;quality of life like we do, then they should work to recreate our success
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they are at. Part of that is re-engineering their society. Societies that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;produce more people than can be sustained on their resources not only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;degrade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;their own quality of life, by exporting the results of their bad social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reproduction policies to our countries, they not only perpetuate a dumb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;where they are at, but they export people who will perpetuate those same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;dumb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ideas elsewhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am shocked by this being said by an American. If some nation in the world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the proof of you being wrong it is the US! Immigrants are not unskilled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or uneducated. A ticket to the US is EXTREMELY expensive in most poorer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countries. Face it, you're receiving the elite of these countries, for free.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You get already trained people that are willing to work and work hard. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also negate the concept of economic growth. And besides, the MORAL aspect. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the right to live where I damned well please, as long as I don't mooch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on other people. Really, immigration policy should be one of transhumanism's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more important issues. If we want dynamism, new ideas, new possibilities in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our cultures- we should fight for a free immigration policy.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I've said several times already, I'm not opposed to immigration per se. You
<BR>
are right that the vast majority of legal immigrants we get are top quality
<BR>
people, educated, informed, good citizens, and highly productive. The US has
<BR>
benefited greatly from immigration, and many more repressive countries have
<BR>
suffered from losing their best people who immigrated here (the scientists
<BR>
responsible for the Manhattan Project being just one example, plus Andy Grove,
<BR>
George Soros, Nicola Tesla, Andrew Carnegie, etc.)
<BR>
<P>What I am trying to illustrate is that while the US, and the small number of
<BR>
people, relatively, who immigrate benefit frequently, the causes of large scale
<BR>
immigration inherent in other countries get subsidised by permissive immigration
<BR>
policies, and it may be that more people suffer in the end, than benefit,
<BR>
because those societies people immigrate from perpetuate the poor conditions by
<BR>
the 'evaporation' of the part of the population that is most likely to create
<BR>
change if they remained. Immigration is a pressure relief valve for other
<BR>
societies. Take Cuba for example. All of Castro's enemies and opposition do not
<BR>
live in Cuba, they live in Miami, where they are powerless to affect change in
<BR>
Cuba, and this is exactly how Castro likes it. Why do you think he promoted the
<BR>
Mariel Boatlift in the 80's? The Soviets for many years found it easier to exile
<BR>
someone to the west than to shoot them or send them to the gulags.
<BR>
<P>Your point is quite valid about 'living where you damn well please without
<BR>
mooching on other people'. Its that 'without' that so many seem to fail to
<BR>
understand or accept. A question though: If you want to live next door to me, do
<BR>
you think that gives you the right to tell me how to live, to change the way I
<BR>
live? If you don't, then welcome to the neighborhood. If you do, then please
<BR>
stay where you are, or go somewhere else.
