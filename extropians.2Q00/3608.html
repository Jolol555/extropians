<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since when exactly was the level of taxation directly inversely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; proportional to how 'free' a country is? Unless one is arguing for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; system of no taxation and public services at all, the specifics seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat irrelevant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The specifics are entirely relevant.  First, the amount of taxation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; essentially determines how much of your labor is slave labor (adjusted for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rate of return, but that typically is pretty damn low).  Second, taxation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is tied more closely to service usage is more fair than taxation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; based on other arbitrary metrics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; [snip long, but very good example of (non)efficient tax usage]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I was ambiguous. What I think I meant is that the specifics in terms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the percentile figures for taxation are not much use with no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; consideration of how that money is being used (which can be well or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; badly, as you say).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Once you've decided to allow for some taxation, however (as opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; none at all, as Mike has suggested - and it is a vaild option) it makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; very little sense to try and compare exactly how much freedom a country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; has removed, via its taxes. There are simply far too many factors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, the fact is that Charlie is enslaved 40% of the time, while I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enslaved less than 16% of the time. Which of us is more free?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But if you look at both formal and effective freedoms, you may work out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be more free than before, overall.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Formally, I have the right to go into a computer shop and buy myself a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nice shiny new laptop. Effectively, I can't, because I can't afford it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Formally, I have the right to a good education, but in a tax-free,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; service-free system, I may not have the effective freedom to have it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But by removing some of one of my freedoms (the right to choose how I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spend my money), one of my other rights is protected.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have the right to educate yourself, or to buy an education. You
<BR>
could volunteer to participate in the public school system, but forcing
<BR>
others who choose to send their kids to private school to also pay taxes
<BR>
to support you sending your kids to school is criminal. You are only
<BR>
gaining your education by stealing from others. At least be honest about
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Things aren't as simple as more tax == less freedom. By careful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adjustment - removing some to ensure, or add, others - one can end up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with greatly varying amounts of freedom.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, its not zero sum like you seem to assume. Leaving more money
<BR>
in the hands of private citizens aids economic growth and increases
<BR>
personal wealth and standards of living, and more people can afford a
<BR>
good education bought on the open market. Its a synergistic effect.
<BR>
Public education is merely a chimera by which a union gets the
<BR>
government to force you to use union labor in educating your kids, thus
<BR>
making your education costs higher than they should be.
