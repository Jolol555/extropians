<EM>&gt; The press said that antiballistic missile system they'd like, no need to

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Reaganesque Star Wars bubble that would stop the rain of Soviet warheads on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the way down.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Consider this.  A ship full of illegal chinese immigrants runs itself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aground on the shore of New Jersey. (old news) The Navy didn't intercept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this ship, the Coast Guard didn't intercept this ship, the spy satellites
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't detect the ship (in time, but probably had pics seen later of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, speed and final location stuck on the beach) and there are literally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousands of ships plying the coasts of the US and oh by the way, the coasts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of all of our Allies.  What about them?
</EM><BR>
<P>What makes you think nobody saw it there? That was a surface ship, not a
<BR>
submersible object or vessel.

<EM>&gt; All a so-called rouge nation, faction, or religous group fundamentalist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christian group or otherwise, need do is pull up to the coast of a nation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; errect the very short range missile launcher on its deck and push the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; button.
</EM><BR>
<P>Very true.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Batteries of the latest and greatest Patriot, ABL, GBL, even Texas Air
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; National Guardsmen shoulder to shoulder with Stingers would likely not bring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it down.  It would go where, or close enough to where ever they wanted it to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go with NBorC warheads.  And believe me a small cell of fundamentalists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trained, educated and who had just vacationed in the US with their latest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GPS locator, will not feel &quot;put out&quot; by the US government funding an ABM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system.  Their goal is not like the former Soviets to go toe to toe with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US, it will be to make a point.  And they'll give it their best Midwest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; University try and they won't care if the first one doesn't hit pay dirt.
</EM><BR>
<P>GPS is not currently usable for navigating supersonic devices very well
<BR>
at all. It takes a few seconds to lock onto all the necessary satellite
<BR>
signals (you need more than the standard number because you also need
<BR>
altitude information), and by the time you have data, you are now
<BR>
several miles away from where you were when you started, so the locks
<BR>
you get on each satellite signal are over a large foot print several
<BR>
miles in diameter. You could actually be anywhere within that foot
<BR>
print.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Terrorism (read rouge nation) is a different animal than world domination by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a totalitarian government system.  They aren't sweating a national economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situation on their homefront.  They have funding sources like BinLadin and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dream of rocking the world, not taking it over.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I don't think you understand the motivations of terrorists. They are
<BR>
almost exclusively nationalists: palestinians, armenians, serbs,
<BR>
afghans, pakistanis, irish, etc. and their goals are very nationalistic
<BR>
in scope. Bin Laden's objectives personally are to get the US out of
<BR>
Saudi Arabia. Being as that they are nationalists, they DO have a
<BR>
homefront, and they DO have safehouses and home bases. These concrete
<BR>
locations can be attacked in reprisal if they are so stupid as to try
<BR>
anything (as seen by US attacks against Libya, against Hezbollah in
<BR>
Lebanon, Hussein in Iraq, as well as many attacks against iranian oil
<BR>
platforms in the Gulf that were used in the late 80's as mission launch
<BR>
platforms against wester oil ships, and against Bin Laden in
<BR>
Afghanistan).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Get off the Star Wars dream, this is not the 70s, 80s, or 90s.  It is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different world.  Spend the money and devote the research elsewhere.  Design
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a stealth patrol car for the Kansas State Police.
</EM><BR>
<P>The last thing police need are stealth patrol cars.
