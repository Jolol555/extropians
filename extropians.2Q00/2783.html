<EM>&gt; &gt; The rest of the world is totally aware as to who controls the UN, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doubt it is seen as representative of the planet outside the US and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Europe, and I'm not so sure the Europeans feel this way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The UN will not and cannot be representative of &quot;the planet&quot;.  It doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even represent the people of the US.  
</EM><BR>
<P>1: that &quot;it doesn't even&quot; is a telling point.
<BR>
2: isn't that why the US elects a govt?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The UN is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irritatingly paternalistic organization that is a poster child for why the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; centralization of government is bad.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, as well as a shining example as to just how far the world is
<BR>
influenced by non-obvious forces.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I was thinking of something else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And no, I don't want to live under one world govt, mainly because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would result in the entire world eventually becoming homogenous and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bland.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Have you considered how many people would have to die to get to that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;comfortable&quot; stage?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope! How many?
<BR>
Have you considered how many people will die via any other method you
<BR>
care to think of?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Only we wouldn't call it a &quot;titanic war&quot;, since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; history is written by the victors, right?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I, personally, would rather see a one world govt come about via
<BR>
stealth and treaty, as is happening right now.
<BR>
There's other ways to influence peoples than via conquest, you know.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Other than the cultural diversity issues, the sooner the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; better.  If we can't get rid of these horrible nation-states entirely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at least let's have just one so we can avoid titanic wars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The titanic wars between nation-states have bodycounts that are dwarfed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the bodycounts inside nation-states caused by ill-run governments.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I really really really doubt that.
<BR>
And I think you'll find that there would be a small minority of states
<BR>
which would account for most of the deaths, as opposed to a world war
<BR>
where the deaths are spread all over the place.
<BR>
<P>And I still fail to see your point.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it is quite plausible that those &quot;titanic wars&quot; *reduced* the total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bodycount.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Looking at it from a long-term perspective, sure.
<BR>
And WWII did more to bring us closer to a single world govt than any
<BR>
other single thing you can name.
<BR>
<P>So, once again, I fail to see your point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't see how a world government would not make this worse.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's six of one, half dozen of another. Ideally, I'd like to see the
<BR>
world broken up into tribal city-states, anarcho-collectives, etc., but
<BR>
that's just me.   But, I think a single world govt would result in a 
<BR>
far more peaceful world than the one we have now.
<BR>
<P>It's a matter of opinion whether or not people's &quot;liberty&quot; would be
<BR>
infringed, but your liberties tend to be torpedoed in a war zone, so
<BR>
what the hell.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess this is a jurisdictional issue for you (&quot;It is much better to kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our people ourselves than to have other nation-states do it.&quot;).  
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, dude, can you drag your mind out of this weird &quot;governments exist
<BR>
only to kill you&quot; mindset, as I'm just not interested in discussing an
<BR>
issue I consider patently mindless?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see how having a world monopoly on deciding who lives or dies is a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing.  
</EM><BR>
<P>See previous point.
<BR>
And get over it.
<BR>
<P>And besides: what on earth makes you think such a govt would have a
<BR>
death penalty, given that most nations don't?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You are making the baseless assumption that you won't end up on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;people it is okay to kill&quot; list that most governments seem to have.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, given the fact that the odds are well and truly in my favour, yes,
<BR>
of course.
<BR>
Although, no, I would probably be top of the list.
<BR>
But this is all hypothetical, so what ever.
<BR>
<P>And besides, what is bad for me may well be good for the world, and I'll
<BR>
go for the greater good, coz I'm ace like that.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem with a world government is that once you end up on that list for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any reason, ridiculous or not, there is nowhere else you can go.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you lie awake worrying about such things? I don't.
<BR>
If you WERE on that list in any country, you've got to get over the
<BR>
border to get away, so your point is a little bit pointless, as it were.
<BR>
We all live in such a situation now, so what would change? Extradition
<BR>
treaties exist right now, so what would change?
<BR>
<P>And wouldn't it be a GOOD thing if the really bad guys had nowhere to
<BR>
go?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly wouldn't be reasonable to expect any real justice in such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, sure, but it doesn't keep me up at night.
<BR>
Future wars worry me greatly though.
<BR>
And I'm not an american, so it's far less likely I'll be involved in any
<BR>
future huge wars, whereas it's a given the US will be.
