I've started taking Ginkgo Baloba just a little while ago, in the smallest 
<BR>
dosage available at the store (40mg), and am taking one a day. I have, to my 
<BR>
surprised, noticed an increase in creativity, and general well being, but at 
<BR>
the same time I've noticed two other mental effects, which I was wondering 
<BR>
if others have experienced as well, or if there is any documentation of. One 
<BR>
is that I've been having nightmares. Ginkgo is supposed to increase blood 
<BR>
flow to the brain, so the increase in nightmares doesn't surprise me. When I 
<BR>
was a kid, my bed broke, and was slanted for a while until it was fixed. I 
<BR>
started to notice that whenever I would sleep with my head on the side which 
<BR>
was slanting downwards, I would have really scary nightmares. The other 
<BR>
effect I have noticed with the Ginkgo is an increase in obsessive thoughts. 
<BR>
I have thought for a while that I have a mild case of obsessive compulsive 
<BR>
disorder, because I will tap my fingers in a certain pattern over and over, 
<BR>
and if I mess up the pattern it will bother me. This has never been a big 
<BR>
deal, and it only manifests itself when I am very bored. If I'm doing it, 
<BR>
and something comes up to take my attention away, I stop, with no problem, 
<BR>
and it has never interfered with my life. But in the past couple days, if I 
<BR>
am interupted in the middle of a &quot;tapping pattern&quot;, I really feel like I 
<BR>
*must* continue the pattern until I've finished and mastered the entire 
<BR>
thing, and feel anxiety if I don't. This only seems to happen in the first 
<BR>
few hours after taking it. I'm going to continue with the same dosage for a 
<BR>
while, then stop, and see if I notice a change back to normal.
