<P><EM>    &gt; Using only 9 lbs requires capabilities of the highest caliber. You don't just
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;learn how in college. Publicly available designs call for much more.
</EM><BR>
<P>A sphere of Plutonium of normal density  just reaches criticality  at  9 pounds,
<BR>
so that would be the easiest size bomb to make. If you wanted to use more you'd have
<BR>
to take extra measures to ensure that the parts did not detonate before assembly. If you
<BR>
wanted to use less you'd have to take extra measures to ensure that more neutrons
<BR>
were reflected back into the core or improve the chemical shaped charge explosive so
<BR>
the Plutonium is compressed to greater than normal density. As I've said human beings
<BR>
have made several thousand tons of this crap.
<BR>
<P>You should read the 1973 book &quot;The Curve of Binding Energy&quot; by John McPhee.
<BR>
It's about the physicist Ted Taylor, he's the fellow who designed the backpack nuke
<BR>
I was talking about, if fact he was the chief designer of the fission part of nearly every
<BR>
nuclear weapon the USA deployed in 1960's and 70's. The reason he agreed to cooperate
<BR>
with McPhee on the book was that even in 1973 nuclear terrorism scared the hell out of him.
<BR>
He strongly maintained that if they had the plutonium or U235 any physics graduate student
<BR>
or even a bright undergraduate could make a bomb; it wouldn't be nearly as efficient or as
<BR>
powerful as one he knew how to make but it would be strong enough to crack open Hover
<BR>
Dam or knock over the World Trade Center Towers. His military bosses thought he was
<BR>
exaggerating so he challenged them, he asked that they give him some plutonium,
<BR>
legal commercial explosives, some simple tools like baking tins and measuring cups
<BR>
and one weeks time and without using classified knowledge he would actually make
<BR>
a nuclear bomb. Then he wanted to take it out to the test range and see if it worked.
<BR>
He really pushed for this but it scared his bosses too much and they wouldn't let him,
<BR>
but he made his point.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>    &gt;Plutonium dust poisoning kills you in a matter of a few days. Actual physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;skin contact with the weapons grade metal will kill you as quickly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not true. Although I wouldn't want to try it myself I'm told that you can safely hold
<BR>
a (sub critical!) chunk of Plutonium metal in your unprotected hand, they say it
<BR>
feels warm. Almost any measurable level of Plutonium dust in your lungs will
<BR>
kill you but probably not for a decade or two.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Even the US doesn't make half megaton weapons any more
</EM><BR>
<P>How long do you thing it would take an experienced nuclear nation to special
<BR>
order an H bomb of any size desired? I would guess between 5 and 6 hours.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Akhmed's ICBM is going to hit the right state. Completely useless.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, so it hits Boston not New York. Besides what about Ivan's ICBM.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; My laser battle stations are small nukes with dozens of xray waveguides
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; surrounding a heavy sheilding shell. You can launch literally hundreds of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; from the bay of a space shuttle, and they can take sand abrasion as a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; course.
</EM><BR>
<P>Lets see, your space station is full of delicate optical elements, antennas and solar cells
<BR>
not to mention exquisitely precise X-ray waveguides, and yet it's much tougher than a tank,
<BR>
much tougher even than even a World War 2 battleship.
<BR>
I think we've entered the realm of fantasy.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;laser technology is a booming industry for health care, for industrial
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;cutting and welding, all sorts of things, plus you've got the launch laser
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;program as well... there are way more job openings now for laser research than
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;just a few years ago.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps you know of a company that is feverishly hiring people so they can make
<BR>
a trillion watt pulsed chemical pulsed laser for civilian use but I don't.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;How many terrorists do you know that have submarines with ranges of more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;10,000 miles, can carry (and launch) cruise missiles? None.
</EM><BR>
<P>I never said terrorists would use cruse missiles or submarines, I did say that
<BR>
ICBMs are not the only way for nations or terrorists to deliver H bombs and
<BR>
your space battle wagon would be powerless against them.
<BR>
<P><EM>          &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>         &gt;&gt;I've heard that the beam had much less power than expected and nobody had
</EM><BR>
<EM>         &gt;&gt;any idea how to aim it to hit a tiny fast moving target thousands of miles away.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;Thats what I expect you would have heard. Disinformation does wonders
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't believe that for a minute. Even Star Wars supporters in congress are pessimistic
<BR>
about X ray Lasers nowadays, there is simply no way on earth that would have happened
<BR>
if things had been going well. Besides, if the great success is top secret how the hell
<BR>
do you know about it?
