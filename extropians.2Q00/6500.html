CURT SAID: &quot;...That's not an advantage to short life; it's an advantage to
<BR>
early reproduction.  It causes short lifespan only if early
<BR>
reproduction and long life are somehow incompatible. In that
<BR>
case, the incompatibility itself is the main casue of aging
<BR>
- the tradeoff alone creates aging....&quot;
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: Curt, you're right of course...clumsy English again! But the
<BR>
&quot;incompatibility&quot; is really (i) diminishing (cost/benefit) returns to
<BR>
maintaining reproductive ability when viable progeny is extant... and (ii)
<BR>
the negative benefits of loading the genepool with archaic combinations in
<BR>
the face of rapid environmental change....
<BR>
<P>Some long lived complex species: tortoises; macaws; elephants; humans seem
<BR>
to have real advantages for the coexistence in a population of several
<BR>
generations.
<BR>
<P>But generational depth is almost nonexistent in many real populations... the
<BR>
species seem to favour short life and develop interesting mechanisms to
<BR>
foster death.
<BR>
<P>Lastly, in species where death by predation, misadventure etc. is high and
<BR>
thus there is no real &quot;danger&quot; of loading the gene pool with oldies (...the
<BR>
survival curve will be exponential anyway!!) we should sometimes see
<BR>
long-lived non-ageing species. Maybe sea turtles; carp; and certain catfish
<BR>
fit this model to a certain extent...
<BR>
<P>But then they STILL eventually age and die when captive reared  in suitable
<BR>
habitats. Is ageing different then... are they coming up against cellular
<BR>
ageing constraints specific to the genetic complexities of being a metazoan?
