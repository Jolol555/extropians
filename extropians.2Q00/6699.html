<P>I'm sure everyone is finding this discussion as numbing as I, although
<BR>
perhaps for different reasons. Still, I feel obliged to make a couple of
<BR>
points:
<BR>
<P>The `unreal' or `coercive' service (publicly funded) is clearly of benefit
<BR>
to *everyone* since:
<BR>
<P>the rich, as I noted (at least in Australia, maybe not elsewhere) often use
<BR>
their access to large tax-funded hospitals and their specialised machines,
<BR>
staff, etc;
<BR>
<P>doctors tend to be trained in these hospitals, and in Oz at least they get
<BR>
their education at public universities;
<BR>
<P>late industrial civilisation benefits immensely by having almost all its
<BR>
citizens reasonably healthy, immunized,  ready for work and not falling
<BR>
about in the street, which is perhaps best ensured by health services
<BR>
readily available to everyone--just as it is sensible to have as many
<BR>
people as possible able to read, count, calculate and wipe their arses, not
<BR>
just those whose parents are prepared and able to pay for instilling these
<BR>
skills on a private basis (even if that is a better way to go for those who
<BR>
can and are willing to do so).
