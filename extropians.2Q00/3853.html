<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; It was quite evident that nanotech is gaining steam. Technanogy sponsored
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the event, they are a nanotech incubator backed by Ted Waitt (of Gateway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; computers). Their first project is &quot;nano aluminum&quot;, which in its first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; application is the creation of super high thrust solid rocket fuel. Think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; single stage to orbit at $50 to 100 a pound. But for starters they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; working on refitting stingers and other conventional weapons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Nanopowdered aluminum is not all that remarkable- there's a product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Right, they seem to be partnering though with a large industrial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partner that will allow them to produce tons of it per day. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparently are patenting the manufacturing process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; called AlEx or some such which is nanoscale aluminum powder made by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exploding a wire with a capacitor discharge in a helium atmosphere.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has a slightly positive heat of formation relative to bulk Al, but solid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fuels are inherently a poor match for orbital launch- you get better Isp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and effective bulk density out of liquid fuels, and for SSTO or even a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cheap TSTO, delta-V is most important.  Solids are great for tactical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; propulsion (ie missiles) but just can't compete with liquids for system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bulk density, mass fraction, and Isp.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well I am not a rocket scientist :0 But I can scan in a chart from their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business plan (or perhaps it is on their old site at nanopropulsion.com)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showing how their system is waaay better than the shuttle or other methods.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The idea is that the nanoaluminum allows for a much denser mix with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other materials in the fuel, and therefore much faster reaction rates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and therefore much much higher thrust than what you get from conventional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mixing techniques. Also they go on about how this would also allow for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nozzleless rockets that could even consume their casing on the way up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There would be no &quot;hole&quot; in the center of the fuel, it would just burn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the end. What do you think?
</EM><BR>
<P>Cast it on the rear of a vehicle that has an aerospike hull going down
<BR>
thru the fuel. Once it reaches supersonic speeds, the shock wave will
<BR>
contain the burning and generate thrust, but I don't see how it won't
<BR>
just let the fire crawl up the sides at subsonic speeds. You'd have to
<BR>
have some kind of containment shell near the lower end to prevent this
<BR>
until it reaches at least mach 2 I'd guess.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; One problem with metallized solid propellants for tactical missiles is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;signature&quot;- they burn *damn* hot and have a very bright plume (consider
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the shuttle SRBs).  This serves to warn the target that you've just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; launched, enabling him to take countermeasures.  A major focus in new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hypervelocity missile developement is low-observable propulsion, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has a purely gaseous exhaust with low luminosity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They seemed to think their biggest problem is that the missle tracking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems are unable to handle the higher speeds.
</EM><BR>
<P>How much higher speeds are we talking about? It would be really nice to
<BR>
be able to finally realize the Thor system of hypersonic crowbars.
