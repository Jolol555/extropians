<P>Dear Allison:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does your guest, Maurice Strong, really want to &quot;end
<BR>
pollution&quot; as he says? Does he really use his business career as a means
<BR>
to an end (public service)? The ability to build affordable,
<BR>
pollution-free villages and cities has been with us for a long
<BR>
time. Unfortunately people like Dean McDonough, U Virginia, are just a few
<BR>
voices in the wilderness. Mr. Strong could fund such a planning effort
<BR>
based at U Virginia. I will buy in, but only if it is the best village on
<BR>
the planet. I have very high standards. All I need to convince me is a 30
<BR>
page &quot;Architectural Booklet&quot;.
<BR>
FWP. 
<BR>
<P>See &lt;<A HREF="http://www.wkap.nl/journals/genp">http://www.wkap.nl/journals/genp</A>&gt; re &quot;Journal of Genetic Programming
<BR>
and Evolvable Machines&quot;.

re previous &quot;thread&quot;:
<BR>
Below is a &quot;nonanthropomorphic&quot; reply to Jose's sound answer. The previous
<BR>
reply had to to with the anthropomorphic &quot;Robomartha&quot;. False Creek is the
<BR>
long, narrow inlet of the Pacific Ocean which runs through the middle of
<BR>
Vancouver. The City Administration wants to build a model village on False
<BR>
Creek for about 5,000 people. A couple of years ago L'Anse, Quebec decided
<BR>
to pursue tourist dollars by crowning Denys I, Le Roi de L'Anse and
<BR>
recently Toronto billionaire Conrad Black decided he wanted to pursue a
<BR>
British peerage and become Prince Conrad-the-Magnificent of Toronto. It is
<BR>
in the context of this backgrounder that the essay below was written.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is most probable that these machines will have a lot of

<EM>&gt; the characteristics of HAL 9000 in _2001: a Space Odissey_.

<EM>&gt; Able to speak, to understand orders and of having a simple

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yet nothing that I would call &quot;thinking&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't worry about the philosophical issue of &quot;thinking&quot;. I am concerned
<BR>
with performance/results/achieving objectives. Remember that HAL in 2001
<BR>
could have been considered to be the space ship itself. And as for
<BR>
&quot;thinking&quot;, hey...how many people you know are &quot;thinkers&quot;? A lot of the
<BR>
&quot;thinking&quot; I do is just mechanical. Ask me to add columns of numbers. Is
<BR>
my method any more a matter of &quot;thinking&quot; than the guy who uses an abacus
<BR>
or vice-versa? Most of the time I find thinking to be BORING as hell and
<BR>
I'd rather have a machine do it for me. I want to be a &quot;Meta-Thinker&quot; who
<BR>
gives regal commands using voice recognition technology to the machinery
<BR>
of his robotic village.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let's imagine that Vancouver City Council suddenly gets
<BR>
&quot;inspired&quot; re this model village for 5,000 people they want to build on
<BR>
False Creek. First they heed the words of William McDonough, Dean of
<BR>
Architecture at U. Virginia who says that any community development built
<BR>
now which does not meet the criterion of &quot;little or no pollution&quot; is the
<BR>
result of inferior planning &lt;<A HREF="mailto:wam4b@virginia.edu?Subject=Re:%20[BCPolitics]%20Triton:%20As%20an%20Evolvable%20(Self-Improving)%20Robotic%20Village%20(fwd)&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.GSO.4.21.0005222207340.10595-100000@vcn.bc.ca&gt;">wam4b@virginia.edu</A>&gt;. Next they decide it will
<BR>
allow people the option of getting from any point to any point without
<BR>
facing inclement weather which is a characteristic of International
<BR>
Village, recently completed on the north side of False Creek.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The city of Baltimore was seriously considering acquiring the first
<BR>
Triton City and installing it in Baltimore Harbor, (1968)....&quot; writes
<BR>
L.S. Seiden in his Fuller Biography. Triton was a three-sided stepped
<BR>
complex for 5,000 people which would sit on floats. The US Navy had
<BR>
attested it to be seaworthy.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the US Navy seems to have a strong interest in genetic algorithms
<BR>
and evolving (self-improving) machines. I think this is better than both
<BR>
the &quot;USS Eldridge&quot; project and Sgt. Bilko (Steve Martin) with his &quot;hover
<BR>
tank&quot; put together. Therefore let me ask the US Navy for a floating
<BR>
complex to house 5,000 people with the best computer money can buy and the
<BR>
best robotic receptors and effectors money can buy. Isn't it Christmas
<BR>
yet? This &quot;HAL&quot; will have lots of eyes and ears and hands all co-ordinated
<BR>
by the mainframe computer. It will also be a &quot;learning machine&quot;. We will
<BR>
program it to LEARN TO SELF-IMPROVE. Over time it will be able to do more
<BR>
and more of this on its own. But at first we humans will help it, using
<BR>
the dictum of the late BF Skinner, &quot;If it can be verbalized, it can be
<BR>
programmed.&quot; In other words we verbalize the general plan for Triton's
<BR>
self-improvement and the robotic receptors, effectors and artificial
<BR>
intelligence take over once that has been turned into machine language.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer-term objective of Triton II will be to evolve into a
<BR>
sky-city, perhaps like the warm-air-lift Sky Cities (Fuller
<BR>
Spheres/Domes) which Fuller describes in &quot;Critical Path&quot; and from there to
<BR>
undertake a &quot;Space Odyssey&quot;. We give Triton a few lasers to play with and
<BR>
work into a launch system. (&quot;Tetra&quot; was a large Fuller Sea City designed
<BR>
for Matsutaro Shoriki). All this time it will have to maintain and
<BR>
improve upon other criteria such as being pollution-free, providing
<BR>
sheltered transportation as above, and total automation in the provision
<BR>
of goods and services. As soon as fully autonomous evolution &quot;kicks
<BR>
in&quot;, we &quot;meta-thinkers&quot; will not have to program Triton to self-improve.
<BR>
We will sit around and sing the national anthem of the &quot;Kingdom of False
<BR>
Creek&quot;. The lyrics begin:
<BR>
<P>&quot;I don' wanna work
<BR>
I jus' wanna bang on de drum all day.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have more than one Triton, they can constitute a colony of
<BR>
communicating-cooperating robots. Each one with 5,000 human
<BR>
inhabitants. Now that has Bilko's &quot;hover tank&quot; beat by a long shot.
<BR>
But even at this primitive stage in its evolution a collection of such
<BR>
future villages adjoined in a city would be autonomous for energy, food
<BR>
and water.
