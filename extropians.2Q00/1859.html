<EM>&gt; &gt; As one who deeply respects Gates and Microsoft, I want MS to resume as it

<EM>&gt; &gt; a system which has none of those facets makes it hard for me to see how it

<EM>&gt; I strongly advise you to read Judge Jackson's original Findings of Fact

<EM>&gt; Microsoft's practices have sought to establish and maintain a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the operating system field. They have then used the leverage this has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given them to establish strongholds in other areas. In all of these,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they have ignored standards compliance, acted uncompetetively to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point of illegality and in general been directly in the way of free and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open control of technological development - something I know people on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this list support.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've read Judge Jackson's decision. Despite everything that has been
<BR>
done by Microsoft, they failed the one crucial test: the government
<BR>
could not demonstrate, in a quantifiable manner, that they consumer was
<BR>
harmed in any way. The anti-trust laws are not there to protect the
<BR>
competition, they are there to protect the consumer from paying more
<BR>
than a fair market would cause them to pay. There was the vague claim
<BR>
that people pay 50% more for a windows OS than they should, but no proof
<BR>
or explaination as to how that conclusion was reached, and in spite of
<BR>
the evidence showing that the only other potentially comparable OS that
<BR>
is cheaper is actually a 'free' OS that typically costs you $50 on a CD
<BR>
(windows typically costs about $89.00 on CD-ROM). Judge Jackson's
<BR>
decision is a vague and meandering decision, that is empty of detail or
<BR>
specificity. I have little doubt that the decision will get tossed on
<BR>
appeal.
<BR>
<P>What people on this list support is respect for the property rights of
<BR>
the individual, the right of private enterprise to conduct its business
<BR>
free of government interference, and the right to make a profit. We
<BR>
don't support your right to control my product development.
