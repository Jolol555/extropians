<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that this was a comparison of a generation #1 product with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; generation #5 product. And the generation #1 product was in the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; ease-of-installation bracket as MacOS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As a brief point (maybe I'm jumping ahead of Michael here), it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; probably not quite correct to say Corel's is generation #1, being built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on a good deal of Linux development in general, and specifically being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; derived from Debian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Iffy point. Corel took Debian 'Slink' and turned it into their own distro.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Along the way, they wrote their own installer -- the standard Debian one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is (cough, cough) not exactly user friendliness personified -- and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bolted KDE on top of it. They filed a lot of rough edges off of KDE (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspect their usability testing experience came in very handy) and bolted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some extras into the distro.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I know - but since all the software it incorporates and builds on
<BR>
goes back varying periods of time up to at least 16 years, it's very
<BR>
iffy to say it's a generation #1 product even if it is the first release
<BR>
by that company (it's a *distribution*, remember).
<BR>
<P>Anyway, as I pointed out a little earlier, the 'generation' analogies
<BR>
are very ambiguous and are probably a terminology for us to avoid.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What I think is worth noting is that the quality of their installer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improved noticeably between successive non-public betas and the final
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; release; the early betas couldn't even cope with a PS/2 mouse!  That's why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I characterise it as a release 1.0 product; the kernel and command line
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuff certainly isn't, but what everyone's judging Corel by is the quality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of their installer and desktop integration, and _that_ is definitely still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a bit fresh. Although their 1.0 beats SuSE's 6.0 into a cocked hat, IMO ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Ew, ew, ew, comparisons of version numbers...
<BR>
<P>Remember when MS jumped Word from version 2 to version 6, so people
<BR>
would think it was on a par with WordPerfect's 6.0 release?
<BR>
<P>Little pet annoyance of mine.
