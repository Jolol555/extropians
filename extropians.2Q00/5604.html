Mormonism has a low retaining rate, however, from what I hear. How do the other religious minorities fare? Amish, Mennonites, etc.?

<P>The Mormon retention rate I believe is only fifty per cent at best after the passing of one year for a new convert.  In fact, only half of all Mormons on the membership rolls attend church regularly.  So a fairly small group of people give the Mormon church the financial and political power that it has.
<BR>
<P>There is a saying the church which goes &quot;the best convert any full time missionary will have is himself after his/her mission&quot; and so by serving missions the church creates the leadership base it vitally needs.
<BR>
<P>The church has in the last few years put a great deal of effort into training lay members to work with missionaries in reactivating inactive members and fellowshipping new converts so they won't fall away.  This was always worked on but not to the great extent it is now.    
<BR>
<P>Comparing Mormons to the Amish or Mennonites is not really logical because the Mormon church is in large part living amongst the secular world.  The Baptists or Catholics would make for a better comparison.
