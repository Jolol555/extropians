<EM>&gt; &gt; The ABA is a government supported monopoly.  Without the government to
</EM><BR>
back
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; its power, it would face serious competition from law clinics (which it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; already does in some states of the US*), unlicensed lawyers, etc.  See,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; e.g., _The Rule of Experts: Occupational Licensing in America_ by S.
</EM><BR>
David
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Young for other examples of businesses that use the government to avoid

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A State Supreme Court ruling in Vermont a few years ago found that the
</EM><BR>
legal
<BR>
<EM>&gt; requirements that a person's lawyer be an attorney did not explicitly
</EM><BR>
require
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that the person have a law degree and be a member of the bar. It was shown
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; there is historical evidence that there is a distinct difference between
</EM><BR>
what
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the definitions of an attorney is, and what an attorney-at-law is. The VBA
</EM><BR>
was
<BR>
<EM>&gt; rather miffed at this....
</EM><BR>
<P>Good for Vermont and its people.  I thought it was a socialist commonwealth.
<BR>
Guess I had it pegged wrong.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; * Recently, the law clinic at some Louisiana law school was banned from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; helping people unless the people being helped could prove they made less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than some minimum income standard.  The reason?  People were using the
</EM><BR>
law
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; clinic to sue one of the governor's supporters over, I believe, some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pollution issue.  The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled that this was
</EM><BR>
practicing
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; law without a license -- except in the case of the indigent.  In other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; words, the court protected the monopoly privilige of lawyers from an
</EM><BR>
actual
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; competitor.  (I believe this was on either &quot;60 Minutes&quot; a few months
</EM><BR>
ago.)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sounds typical, though Lousiana's legal system practices Civil Law rather
</EM><BR>
than
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Common Law, so I'm not sure how this would be different.
</EM><BR>
<P>Somehow, I don't think so.  Common Law, btw, is not law is most states of
<BR>
the US.  New Jersey, e.g., went over to statutory law in the 1930s and most
<BR>
other states have done much the same.  This was because of the Progressive
<BR>
Movement I believe.  This does not mean judges don't sometimes try to use
<BR>
Common Law standards and recommendations, but that almost everything in your
<BR>
typical court is going to be statutory -- guidelines, sentencing rules, etc.
<BR>
At least, this is my understanding of the subject.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
