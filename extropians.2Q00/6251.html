<BR>
<P>For a GOOD EFFIN' REASON!!!
<BR>
<P>Yes, of course I'm glad to see words said in my favor, but the reason I
<BR>
asked you and the others (who agreed!) not to reply here is in part
<BR>
because it amounts to PRECISELY the thing that I have found so unethical
<BR>
about many of the Extropians' reactions: they have been, for the most
<BR>
part, merely tribal. On other lists this situation has played out very
<BR>
differently. So what? The point isn't to engage in cheer-leading, but to
<BR>
be willing either 1) to be silent and let people work it out themselves,
<BR>
or 2) take the many hours required to read through the 250K (or
<BR>
whatever) load of the history of this thread, slowly, carefully, before
<BR>
making a comment. It's precisely the failure of several people here to
<BR>
do just that that has been the most serious error.
<BR>
<P>(Also, being &quot;warmed&quot; by comments such as yours -- and warm me they of
<BR>
course do -- is not a mode of interacting with the world (&quot;isn't it
<BR>
great to be 'us'&quot;) I want to reinforce in myself.)
<BR>
<P>While I obviously agree with much of what you've said, please stop -- I
<BR>
say this to others as well, unless you take the time to read ALL the
<BR>
posts involved, check with at least two (or maybe more) people before
<BR>
posting.
<BR>
<P>But best yet -- a pause.
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
Brian.
