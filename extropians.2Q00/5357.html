<P>
I have just read David Pearce's web site--quickly, I must confess, without
<BR>
taking the time to ponder the contents of each paragraph.  All sorts of
<BR>
possibiilities and questions ran through my mind as I was reading, and I'm
<BR>
very sorry I don't have someone around to talk to about it.  I could've
<BR>
talked to my cousin Lizzie, but unfortunately she's dead.
<BR>
<P>She was taking Prozac for a while and described the vividness of colors,
<BR>
escpecially purple, when she was on the drug. Comparing descriptions, we
<BR>
decided that my ordinary view of the world was like her view on Prozac.  I
<BR>
tried taking some to see what it would be like, and I didn't notice any
<BR>
difference in colors.  I DID notice a startling feeling of goodwill towards
<BR>
strangers I encountered, such as people standing in check-out lines at
<BR>
stores.  I found myself striking up conversations with them and they sharing
<BR>
the secrets of their lives with me.  I'd never before found ordinary people
<BR>
so fascinating.  I only used the Prozac for a couple of weeks, because it
<BR>
was having some bad side effects.
<BR>
<P>Something I've been wondering about lately is this:  what is it that makes
<BR>
me and certain of my relatives different from most people?  My daughter
<BR>
brought up this question when Lizzie's son came to visit for a day.  She
<BR>
commented that it was great to see him, because it's rare to meet people who
<BR>
are REALLY FUN to be with, as he is.  The quality I'm talking about has to
<BR>
do with sensing the unexpected in the ordinary--for example, looking at
<BR>
clouds and seeing hundreds of different shade of white and at the same time
<BR>
hearing (in one's mind) all these shades of white translated into
<BR>
corresponding frequencies of sound; or listening to the rumbling of a
<BR>
machine and suddenly hearing intensely beautiful music in the combination of
<BR>
sounds and seeing (in the mind) the sounds translated into something like
<BR>
graphs of mathematical functions, weaving in and out of each other.  Walking
<BR>
down a city street, pausing to look into partly veiled windows and under
<BR>
stones and into alleys can be among the most exciting of experiences.  Most
<BR>
of the time I prefer to walk alone, but when I can be with a person who
<BR>
shares this way of seeing, the experience is all the richer for sharing it.
<BR>
The &quot;bipolar&quot; people I've known sometimes seem to see this way when they're
<BR>
in their manic phases.
<BR>
<P>I've always thought of this way of seeing as being &quot;childlike,&quot; because
<BR>
young children often seem to understand it better than older people. So
<BR>
maybe the explanation for it is that some people retain certain childlike
<BR>
aspects of the nervous system into old age. I'm pretty sure my
<BR>
great-grandmother was like this, although she died when I was pretty young,
<BR>
so I can't know for sure. I'm 50 years old, but I generally feel as though
<BR>
I'm in the company of my elders when I'm with people in their 20's and 30's.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to know more about this, just out of self-curiosity.  Why am I the
<BR>
way I am?  It's a pleasant way of being, except that I don't come across
<BR>
many people to share it with.  Is there some practical use to be made of it,
<BR>
or is it something to be enjoyed mostly in silence (I say in silence,
<BR>
because people usually think I'm crazy if I speak of it.  Lizzie didn't
<BR>
think I was crazy.  God, I miss her so much!). Maybe the Prozac made
<BR>
ordinary people fascinating to me because it allowed me to better translate
<BR>
my thoughts and theirs into a mutually understandable language.
<BR>
