<EM>&gt; Could you tell me how you calculated the 9%-13% annual return and what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adjustments you're referring to?  Where did you get the data?  When I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing my research, I had a difficult time finding info on stocks that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weren't included in indices such as DJ and S&amp;P, even for fairly recent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years, much less for a couple of hundred years ago.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>These calculations come from various economists and financial firms
<BR>
(which for the purposes of this email, mean &quot;my memory&quot;).  Some of the
<BR>
variations in figures come from dollar value adjustments (e.g. inflation)
<BR>
and what indices (if any) were used to calculate the figures.  Also the
<BR>
starting and ending points of these averages vary somewhat, although this
<BR>
does not have a significant impact on the figure.
<BR>
<P>Another good indicator is to look at mutual funds that have been around
<BR>
for a really long time, where &quot;really long time&quot; = 100 years or so.  Most
<BR>
of these funds have a lifetime annual return rate in the 11-14% range, or
<BR>
slightly better than most of the market indices.  Obviously, if the
<BR>
average stock market return was so much less, people would be putting money
<BR>
into these obviously well-managed funds in droves.  That people are not
<BR>
indicates that they do not represent an unusually attractive investment
<BR>
opportunity despite their long historical track record and reasonable
<BR>
return rate.  As a rule (and general mathematical necessity), mutual funds
<BR>
in aggregate will track the stock market in the long run, with a few
<BR>
exceptional over-performers and under-performers.
