<P>
For sick people with degenerative brain diseases awaiting clinical death
<BR>
before cryonic suspension, every day of waiting decreases the integrity of
<BR>
the brain structures that cryonics will freeze into place. In such
<BR>
circumstances, near-term voluntary euthanasia followed by rapid cryonic
<BR>
suspension would offer the best hope for retaining optimal neural health.
<BR>
Yet the law does not allow this in the USA. And any cryonics organization
<BR>
that engaged in such a practice could expect criminal and civil lawsuits
<BR>
almost certain to bankrupt it and possibly imprison its staff.
<BR>
<P>However, a recent decision by the Montana Supreme Court may change this
<BR>
situation for citizens of that state. In an abortion case (James H.
<BR>
Armstrong, M.D. v. The State of Montana, October 1999) the Court went beyond
<BR>
the issues in the case at hand to render a much broader decision regarding
<BR>
an individual's right to choose medical care in consultation with a health
<BR>
professional. Writing for the 6-2 majority, Justice James C. Nelson held
<BR>
that: &quot;The Montana Constitution broadly guarantees each individual the right
<BR>
to make medical judgments affecting her or his bodily integrity and health
<BR>
in partnership with a chosen health care provider free from government
<BR>
interference.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Dissenting Chief Justice J. A. Turnage wrote that: &quot;...the Court's opinion
<BR>
sweeps so broadly as to encompass and decide such issues as the right to
<BR>
physician-assisted suicide and other important health and medical-related
<BR>
issues which simply were not litigated in the case.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I am not an attorney, but this sounds to me like a real opportunity. Someone
<BR>
in Montana could arrange for his or her brain metabolism to be arrested by a
<BR>
medical professional in cooperation with a cryonics suspension team, which
<BR>
would obviate the current, legally-necessary process for a doctor to declare
<BR>
the patient brain-dead before the suspension team can go to work.
<BR>
<P>Can anyone with competencies in law and cryonics comment on this?
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
