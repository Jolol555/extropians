<EM> &gt; I don't want some Harvey Newstromish person to exist in the future. I want

</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; future
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I share that sentiment!
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm so glad that you want to save the original Harvey Newstrom.  Most people
<BR>
are selfishly trying to save their own lives.  And you wouldn't believe how
<BR>
many people would like to see me replaced!
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If it were an upload that captured 100% of your memories, personality and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; intellect, then the connection between the original and the copy would be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 100%.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the similarity would be 100%, but there may be no connection.  Are
<BR>
two identical PC's off an assembly line &quot;connected&quot; in some way?  I think
<BR>
they just look similar, but might have unrelated lives.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; The question is, will science one day be so advanced that they can upload
</EM><BR>
my
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;full essence&quot; into a machine or a new organic brain?  We don't want
</EM><BR>
copies,
<BR>
<EM> &gt; we want ourselves.  And we don't want to chance getting a copy(while we
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM> &gt; dead) that actually thinks it's us!  I envision some sort of
</EM><BR>
super-advanced
<BR>
<EM> &gt; _Star Trek_ style &quot;transporter beam&quot; that transfers me into the new form,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and can even return me to my old one, and without any loss of information,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; energy or matter.  Will that ever be possible?
</EM><BR>
<P>I hope so.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Harvey, I completely understand where you are coming from.  I view a copy
</EM><BR>
as
<BR>
<EM> &gt; a COPY, and even if ABSOLUTELY like me, it is not &quot;ME.&quot;  It is instead a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; totally identical twin.  This is for me so simple to understand.  It will
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; start off totally like me, but in time diverge and develop it's own
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; identity, to at least an extent.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  Maybe having an identical twin of my own makes me more adamant about
<BR>
this, but similarity does not equal identity.  I have an genetically
<BR>
identical clone, and do not think we were ever &quot;one&quot; consciousness even as
<BR>
fetuses.  We were two separate life forms as soon as we were physically
<BR>
separated.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; And any perfect(or simply self-aware) copy (flesh or virtual) of me
</EM><BR>
deserves
<BR>
<EM> &gt; the full legal rights that I myself have.  And does not deserve to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; plaything to be tortured or manipulated.  Again, this is so simple to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; understand.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed!  Let's start an equal rights for equal people campaign.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
