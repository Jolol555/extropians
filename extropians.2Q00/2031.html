<P><EM>&gt; I have had to deal with such persons and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  found that killfiling them, even temporarily, comes pretty close to 
</EM><BR>
solving 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  the problem.
</EM><BR>
Thank you for your suggestion : )
<BR>
The reason I do not use this as my primary solution is twofold. 
<BR>
<P>First of all, it isn't letting the person have the benefit of the doubt. It's 
<BR>
not respectful. Just because he says I'm being stupid doesn't entitle me to 
<BR>
do the same. And perhaps the guy *is* capable of behaving like a gentleman 
<BR>
and refraining from insults if he is told that this hurts my feelings. If I 
<BR>
don't speak up, it implies it's OK to continue to brow beat me. Once he is 
<BR>
told, *it's up to him* whether he respects my wishes and behave more kindly. 
<BR>
Besides, often his posts have value, and he may not know he is cluttering his 
<BR>
page with insults and other kinds of white noise that lessen the impact of 
<BR>
his argument! 
<BR>
<P>Secondly, it does not help the list. New people might think that this insults 
<BR>
are normal and tolerated. They are *not* the norm. I firmly believe that 
<BR>
people who behave badly often are that way simply because key people in their 
<BR>
life LET them. I love ExI list and it's members, and am proud to be a member. 
<BR>
<P><P>I owe it to the ambiance and aesthetics of this place to try to make it a 
<BR>
more pleasant, safe environment to hold dialogue. 
<BR>
