<EM>&gt; -HELLO!!! The reason I didn't &quot;bother&quot; to read the ballot is because I'm
</EM><BR>
yet
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 18, and never had any reason to vote till now when I turn 18 this week. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never ceases to amazes me how people make unfounded assumptions about
</EM><BR>
others
<BR>
<EM>&gt; online.
</EM><BR>
<P>First, Alexander's comments should be directed at both Lee Daniel and me.
<BR>
<P>Second, I looked at sample ballots before I was old enough to vote.  I've
<BR>
also tried to keep up with who is running for major offices.  I'm by no
<BR>
means a political junkie.  (In fact, there are so many things I do not
<BR>
know.)
<BR>
<P>Third, it's common knowledge who Harry Browne is -- author of _How I Found
<BR>
Freedom in an Unfree World_ and one time Presidential candidate.  To not
<BR>
know about him is almost like not knowing about Ayn Rand.
<BR>
<P>I meant know insult by my agreement with Lee Daniel on this.  I was
<BR>
lamenting the fact that most people are ignorant.  Such ignorance is to some
<BR>
extent understandable in Alexander, but not for those who complain about
<BR>
politics always being the same.  (I think Lee Daniel's comments were more
<BR>
directed at that group.  It's one thing to complain about politics after
<BR>
doing the research.  Quite another just to complain because that's what
<BR>
everyone else does [and I MEAN everyone complains, so chiming in with the
<BR>
choir by no means demonstrates one has a good reason to complain].)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
<BR>
