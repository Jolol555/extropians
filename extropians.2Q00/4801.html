<EM>&gt;  What it seems to come down to is: do you think extropianism is what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is defined by Max with his principles, or do you think what really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  matters is each person's own definition?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>SIince the most important part of Max's philosophy to me is individuality and 
<BR>
self-change, I think it would be sad if people followed it, rather than 
<BR>
forging with it as a tool, taking each individual into new terrains.
<BR>
<P>Since individuality is what *drew* me to the philosophy, I balk at any 
<BR>
attempt to get others to follow. I personally don't care what you think -  
<BR>
call me little or big E - but I rankle when people try to tell me what 
<BR>
activities are extropian or not .  
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I liek that the principles are being questioned, and that people are 
<BR>
talking about this stuff
<BR>
BUT: 
<BR>
I started the whole thing for one reason: Why would you tell a sweet person 
<BR>
like Bonnie, who is new, and learning, and expressing herself,  that she 
<BR>
should LURK? 
<BR>
<P>Hey, thats like saying she isn't welcome to post here until she &quot;does some 
<BR>
more homework&quot;.
