<EM>&gt;   I am just playing devil's advocate here.

As ideologies go, it seems to me to be fairly loose -- there's an intrinsic
<BR>
contradiction between encouraging individual transcendence and getting
<BR>
everyone marching in lockstep and wearing a uniform and willing to lay down
<BR>
their lives for der Fuhrer. Right? That's not to say that extropianism
<BR>
doesn't have drawbacks, but it's not obviously a fertile breeding ground
<BR>
for totalitarianism. Which is a good thing, IMO.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; you continues:

<EM>&gt; I'd also like to note that from a non-American perspective making children 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swear an oath of allegiance in school each day looks positively Orwellian, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I don't see massive military power as being admirable, either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I sure don't consider children taking the oath of allegiance to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'brainwashing!'  There is nothing similar in England? I am surprised.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope, there ain't. There's a law dating back to 1945 requiring an act of
<BR>
worship every morning, which is more of an embarrassment than anything
<BR>
else, but there's no nationalistic stuff. There's no oath of allegiance
<BR>
in the UK, period, unless you count whatever oath members of the military
<BR>
swear.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have never thought of the connection with the divine right of kings, very 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting.  The social contract between the citizen, other citizens and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their government is supposed to bind us together in mutual self-interest.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And at least in theory, when a citizen or group of them want to change 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something, the mechanisms are in place to at least give them the chance at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being heard and having something done about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I still think much of the authority of the gov't does come from the law 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcement departments and the military, or in other words, from the barrel 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a gun.  But being a democracy, we have ways of changing things that don't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entail starting a violent revolution! lol  Unlike some other nations where 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is a regular occurence.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
One other thing weirds people over here out about the US; it's the assumption
<BR>
that natural rights exist. But that's another matter. (In general, there
<BR>
are two concepts of rights. One is that 'nature' somehow assigns certain
<BR>
rights to human beings, and those rights exist almost in a platonic sense;
<BR>
they're real things and you can't abolish or add to them. Another philosophy
<BR>
of rights is that rights are an emergent phenomenon, that comes from people
<BR>
behaving towards each other as they themselves would like to be dealt with;
<BR>
your right to life is the corollary of my refraining from killing you. This
<BR>
view of rights is that they're all essentially social constructs, and while
<BR>
they're desirable and necessary they're in no way automatic.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you continue:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The national system we've been bequeathed is just a degenerate form
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the monarchical system, with the powers devolved to a national level 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is just a replacement for the Crown.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Modern democracies are just a degenerate form of the monarchial system?  For 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasons stated above I would have to disagree.  
</EM><BR>
<P>And I repeat that assertion. The system is clearer in the UK, admittedly.
<BR>
What happened here is that an absolute monarchy granted some rights
<BR>
to its feudal lords, and they in turn delegated more rights downward,
<BR>
until the whole thing spun out of control. There was a definitive dust-up
<BR>
over who was the source of legislative power, which ended with a rather
<BR>
conservative king getting his neck shortened; his successor took a rather
<BR>
more relaxed view of parliamentary power and essentially delegated all
<BR>
his law-making authority to a notional body called The Crown. The Crown
<BR>
is to the king as the Presidency is to a specific President; it's an
<BR>
office, with powers that accompany it. The Crown acts in accordance with
<BR>
the wishes of the Government, as led by the Prime Minister. _In_theory_
<BR>
the Crown can do anything it likes; in practice, it's simply a rubber
<BR>
stamp for the democratic institution that executes its authority. This
<BR>
is the legal basis of constitutional power in the UK; feudal monarchical
<BR>
power delegated to a democratically elected government.
<BR>
<P>The US government is less obviously based on this system, but nevertheless
<BR>
its government derives its theory of power from a similar source; an
<BR>
attempt to replace a feudal monarchy's powers with those derived from the
<BR>
citizenship is as much a descendant of the original system as is a feudal
<BR>
monarchy that's had a democratic indirection layer inserted into its way
<BR>
of doing business.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I do think I understand your point as being that ultimately, the federal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gov'ts of even democracies still have incredible power over the citizenry, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even if it is generally more fairly used.  And we are expected as citizens 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be generally loyal subjects to not a king anymore, but our flag and p.m. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or president.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
King, president -- these are people. The underlying institutions -- The
<BR>
Crown, The Presidency -- are rather more similar than most of us like to
<BR>
contemplate. And one may argue that the additional checks and balances
<BR>
added in the past two centuries are just the inevitable parephanalia that
<BR>
go with the expansion of nations from a population of 2-3 million to 60-260
<BR>
million people. There _have_ to be ways of delegating authority; the original
<BR>
institution simply couldn't scale up and retain adequate control.

<EM>&gt; I suppose for me the acid test is, do you feel pride and a touch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emotion when US Navy ships fire cruise missiles at factories in some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other country because of a rumour (no more!) that they're supplying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nasty raw materials to a third party?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Initially, when I hear we are shooting cruise missiles at terrorist-aiding 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; facilities, yes, I do feel pride that we are doing something.  But later, if 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I hear U.S. intelligence sources were wrong and that innocents were hurt and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; killed, then I feel very sad about it.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Do you know how many American citizens are killed by terrorist incidents
<BR>
in a given year? And how many are killed by being struck by lightning?
<BR>
<P>(Terrorism is a _very_ good propaganda tool these days -- for the state.
<BR>
The reality of it is a lot smaller and a lot more marginal than the media
<BR>
bother telling us -- mostly because bad news is what sells advertising
<BR>
best.)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Sometimes in cases like this the military is not to blame, they are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receiving information and taking orders from other parts of the government.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ultimately though, it is all part of the same government.  The U.S. should 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only act when we have solid intelligence and the reason for the cruise 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; missile launch is to impede aggressors and not to boost presidential 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ratings.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So Charlie, how do you think the U.S. and British government should deal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with terrorist (aggressor) nations and organizations?  How would you handle 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them?  Would P.M. Stross ever order bombing raids?  And what would cause him 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to?
</EM><BR>
<P>Depends how ruthlessly dedicated to hanging on to personal power I was ;-)
<BR>
<P>By the way, do you know who invented the idea of &quot;policing by bomber&quot;, when
<BR>
they did it, and in what context?
