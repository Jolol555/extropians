Friends,
<BR>
<P>On Sun, 9 Apr 2000 10:17:02 EDT,
<BR>
From: <A HREF="mailto:GBurch1@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Nanotech%20Restrictions%20(was:%20RE:%20Transparency%20Debate)&In-Reply-To=&lt;3.0.6.32.20000411154830.007b8750@coastside.net&gt;">GBurch1@aol.com</A>, writes:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;At a Foresight-sponsored meeting on security and safety issues last year, I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;had occasion to speak at length with a very senior US defense establishment 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;figure about this question of why we haven't seen more technology-based 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;terrorist attacks against large population groups.  Apparently, it is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;considered somewhat of a mystery in these circles 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>It is standard practice in the establishment media to demonize so-called
<BR>
&quot;terrorists&quot;.  This demonization, which should be understood as a form of
<BR>
propaganda, is so consistent and so thorough that it comes to be accepted
<BR>
as established fact--the common truth.  People in the power establishment,
<BR>
and particularly those in the military, have so internalized these &quot;truths&quot;
<BR>
that their logic no longer deals with the actual facts, and is therefor
<BR>
stymied.  Thus, the mystery.
<BR>
<P>The truth is easy: they are real people, with a real point of view, with a
<BR>
real agenda, who are involved in a political relationship with a sovereign
<BR>
power far more powerful than they are.  The relationship is adversarial and
<BR>
belligerent, and in that mode, violence is an instrument of policy.
<BR>
Violence has such an amplifying--though dangerous--effect, that a small
<BR>
group gets &quot;big&quot; influence from its application.  A clear fact, though not
<BR>
a nice one.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though demonization might lead the average media consumer to believe that
<BR>
&quot;terrorist madmen&quot; are inclined to indiscriminate mass-murder, the truth is
<BR>
far less dramatic: like any entity exercising that large independence of
<BR>
action ordinarily the province only of sovereignty, a group in rebellion
<BR>
against an established regime will take whatever action, violent or
<BR>
non-violent, they believe will advance their agenda.
<BR>
<P>Consider the practice of demonization.  Like the japs and the krauts, and,
<BR>
before them, G Washington--founding father to Americans of today, terrorist
<BR>
traitor in the British press of the time--the &quot;enemy&quot; must never be allowed
<BR>
their humanity, their point of view must never be given a fair hearing.
<BR>
Else they might be seen by the larger population as real people, with a
<BR>
point of view possessed of some merit.   That would lead to political
<BR>
fractiousness, and cramp the freedom of action of the regime in power.
<BR>
<P>Greg continues:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I believe that an empirical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;study should be undertaken in which members of likely groups that have been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;captured and imprisoned should be interviewed about the subject.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course, people in prison, and therefor under special conditions of
<BR>
duress and distress, are likely to be sources of distorted &quot;data&quot;.  One
<BR>
could seek out rebellious factions &quot;in the wild&quot;, in their redoubts, but
<BR>
there again,  they would be presumed to speak &quot;carefully&quot;, with an eye
<BR>
to--and here we see the consistency and logic of their actions--advancing
<BR>
their agenda.
<BR>
<P>I have done some reading on terrorism, and the material I have read falls
<BR>
into two main categories.  The largest is mainstream demonization posing as
<BR>
neutral analysis, and the much smaller group is a generally dispassionate
<BR>
treatment of rebellion, unconventional warfare, regicide, coups de tat, the
<BR>
decapitation strategy, the psychology of guerilla warfare, etc.
<BR>
<P>I expect that there are some non-politicized scholarly treatments of the
<BR>
subject &quot;out there&quot;, perhaps even some recent ones--it's been awhile since
<BR>
I read up on the subject--but you're not likely to find them in the
<BR>
mainstream press.  In fact, the absence of them in the mainstream press
<BR>
could be interpreted as a sign of what such studies find--ie, something
<BR>
inconsistent with the mainstream message.
<BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
