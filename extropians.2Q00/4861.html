<EM>&gt;&gt; Suppose you rob Captain Scott of his ship to prevent him exploring

<EM>&gt;&gt; discover radium.

<EM>&gt;Suppose you give Scott some advice on the utility of sled dogs vs

<EM>&gt;siberian ponies, or Mme. Curie some tips on radiation shielding?

<EM>&gt;Suppose you give a jewish couple of eastern european descent the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Suppose you stop deliberately misinterpreting and distorting worthwhile

<EM>&gt;research, you luddite?
</EM><BR>
<P>I have no idea what makes you think I am against research, let alone a
<BR>
luddite! Yes of course, if, at that time, the knowledge had been
<BR>
available, the right thing to do would have been to tell these people
<BR>
about it! But it wasn't -- Marie Curie was busy *creating* that
<BR>
knowledge. The point of the bit you quoted is that people should not be
<BR>
prevented from taking risks with their own lives just because someone
<BR>
else thinks that the risk is too great. One of the ways in which
<BR>
people are prevented from doing what they think best is by state
<BR>
intervention in (not to mention prohibition of!) research such as the
<BR>
genetic engineering research. The idea of banning this worthwhile
<BR>
research is, I suggest, just as bad as the *old* eugenics programmes
<BR>
in which various groups were forcibly sterilised. People seem to think
<BR>
that regulating or banning this research is good, but that is an
<BR>
example of the very same thinking as that which resulted in the old
<BR>
eugenics programmes. Control of reproduction is again being taken out
<BR>
of the hands of the individual (who may want to make use of the
<BR>
research) and put in the hands of the state (who are regulating who
<BR>
may do what with whom, and what information can be available, and what
<BR>
new knowledge must (not) be created by companies wishing to work in
<BR>
the genetic engineering sphere).
