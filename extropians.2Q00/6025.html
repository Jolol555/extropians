<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, but I am not terribly surprised. I remember when I was in the 2nd or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3rd grade, and the teachers started doing astronomy. I was big into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; astronomy at that age, and knew quite a lot. When the teachers got to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explaining why there are seasons, they claimed it was because the earth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moved closer and farther from the sun in its orbit, whereupon I stood up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and told them they were wrong and proceeded to explain what really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; caused the seasons. I got told to shut up and I was sent to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; principals office... and people wonder why I don't have much respect for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teachers in america...
</EM><BR>
<P><P>You too, huh?  I spent a lot of my childhood in principals' offices,
<BR>
sometimes justifiably, like the time I wrote dirty captions for every
<BR>
picture in my Latin book. I don't remember the details, but I do recall that
<BR>
&quot;The Giant Shitter,&quot; a large horse, appeared as a unifying theme throughout.
