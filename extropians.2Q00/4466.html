<P>&lt;&lt; Whether one considers that difference a big one surely depends on whether
<BR>
one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;subscribe to the etatist philosophy or not.  A &quot;Father beat me almost to
<BR>
death
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;but we are still a family&quot; kind of world view will make the offspring still
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not abandon the family. I understand that kind of Stockholm syndrome appear
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in many families where a drunkard beats the wife and kids regularly. That
<BR>
does
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not make the drunkard less a fascist, of course. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
This one is not really even comparative, unless you consider firing squads
<BR>
and medical experiements comparative to imprisoning. Its not a Stockholm
<BR>
syndrome, the Japanese Americans successfully sued for property taken and
<BR>
there were scads of decorated veterans. Not to be irritating, but are you
<BR>
deliberately x-ing out history because you disagree with my premise. Both
<BR>
Bergen Belsen and Manzinar had guards and barbed wired; but outside of that
<BR>
premiere ugliness; Japanese-Americans did not wind up dead in ditches or up
<BR>
smokestacks. A better comparison would have been African American slavery or
<BR>
the annihilation of the Plains Indian.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;So Extropians equals Nazis for people who don't like extropianism for some
<BR>
reason (ideological reasons, most probably).  Extropians would not call them-
<BR>
selves nazis.&gt;&gt;
<BR>
The ZOG v COG thread came not from me. Its obvious that the ZOG phrase taken
<BR>
from the stomach-Turner Diaries is what someone apparently buys into. So
<BR>
somehow, Jews get bundled into Environmentalists, Christian Fundamentalists,
<BR>
as &quot;enemies of Extropianism?&quot; Bullshit. This is always the excuse &quot;envy&quot; or
<BR>
what have you. I have heard it all before, excuses ladden upon excuses. I
<BR>
hold that that particular group just simply is the canary in the coal mine,
<BR>
and there's a hint of methane circulating down here, my little miners. Maybe
<BR>
that methane emminates out of some nazi-wanabe's ass?
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;Maybe.  OTOH the fact that Karl Marx said he was no Marxist did not stop
<BR>
the onslaught of the Communists, did it?&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>If  Marx was young and virbrant and denounced  Lenin as a head of a
<BR>
murderous, thug government; it would have surely isolated Lenin
<BR>
internationally even with other commies, as well as all world socialist orgs
<BR>
at that time-especially labor unions. Look at what happended when the CCCP
<BR>
lies finally were disbelieved by the people-adios Soviet Union.
<BR>
<P>Concluding: If all Extropianism were to end up being another Aryan
<BR>
Supremacist figleaf (I am hoping that it ain't!) then it'll collapse as such
<BR>
under scrutiny of its purported intellectual conceptualizers.  Example: back
<BR>
in the 70's and 80's Lyndon Larouche was pimping Nuclear Fusion as the
<BR>
ultimate answer, eventually the few plasma physicists got out, after
<BR>
realizing the true intent of Lil' Lyndon. It didn't get him anywhere. The KKK
<BR>
likes to do highway cleanup in Missouri, in an attempt to appear mainstream.
<BR>
People who do pickup truck death dragging will not convince anyone either.
