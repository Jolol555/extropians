<P><EM>&gt; Overally, I think your model explains part of why we do not see hordes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of well educated terrorists. But I still see enough engineers with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  good knowledge of engineering and an apalling lack of sociology to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  make me suspect there are other reasons too.
</EM><BR>
<P>At a Foresight-sponsored meeting on security and safety issues last year, I 
<BR>
had occasion to speak at length with a very senior US defense establishment 
<BR>
figure about this question of why we haven't seen more technology-based 
<BR>
terrorist attacks against large population groups.  Apparently, it is 
<BR>
considered somewhat of a mystery in these circles and various competing 
<BR>
theories have been offered to explain it (but it's universally recognized as 
<BR>
a fact: Biological and chemical technologies have existed for years with 
<BR>
which a &quot;crazed terrorist group&quot; could kill thousands to millions of people, 
<BR>
but this hasn't happened).  The best-accepted theory is that any group well 
<BR>
enough organized and possessing the requisite technical skills is lead by 
<BR>
people who realize that such a move would be counterproductive to any goals 
<BR>
the group may have.  This must be so, it is argued, despite the fact that the 
<BR>
skill and organization level to do such a thing is not THAT great.
<BR>
<P>I think studying this question in greater depth should be one of the highest 
<BR>
priorities for advocates of &quot;GNR&quot; technologies.  I believe that an empirical 
<BR>
study should be undertaken in which members of likely groups that have been 
<BR>
captured and imprisoned should be interviewed about the subject.
