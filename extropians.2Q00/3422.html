<P><EM>    &gt;*I* (this instance of me, if you like) go to step into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; transporter. This instance of me would like to know that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; instance of me will step out of the other end.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;This&quot; instance of you will NOT step out of the transporter, &quot;That&quot;
<BR>
instance of you will. You concede that Mr.That is perfectly happy
<BR>
but you worry about Mr.This, and because he is no longer around you
<BR>
can't ask his opinion of the results. Well, this sort of thing happens
<BR>
every day. The John Clark of yesterday no longer exists, but I
<BR>
remember being him so in my opinion he has survived. However I
<BR>
must admit I have no way of asking the John Clark of yesterday if
<BR>
he is as happy with the results as I am. I just don't worry about it.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Come on, I've been around as some kind of conscious assemblage
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;for a fair number of years, irrespective of what I took into myself at
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;lunch yesterday.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly, and the only conclusion to draw from that is atoms are not important.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;There is continuity of experience even as we change, no?
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;This is what I trying to say with the space-time line idea.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see how you could draw a space-time line of a human body,
<BR>
you'd have to include every particle that had ever been or would ever
<BR>
be part of it. It would be like trying to draw one for an ocean wave.
<BR>
<P>An ocean wave may be very impressive to look at and it might travel for
<BR>
thousands of miles, but although not exactly untrue to say a wave is made
<BR>
of atoms is very misleading. No water molecule travels long distances
<BR>
because of the wave, in fact in deep water a particle simply moves in a
<BR>
vertical circle with a radius of a foot or two and it ends up right back where
<BR>
it started. How are you going to draw a space-time line for that?
