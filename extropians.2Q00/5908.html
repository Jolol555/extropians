<EM>&gt; Moving this off to a different thread (somewhat) I toy with the concept that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jews may have evolved as one of the catalyst peoples (call it chosen) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activate, modify and motivate other peoples. Call this an evolutionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adaptation or a rung on the ladder to the Noosphere (say hey!  Teilhard!) or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something like that there. In might account for &quot;The Longest Hatred&quot; because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no matter what the Jew does, he is hated for it. It historically has become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a-causal despite the desperate, exacerbated, attempts by many to deny this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (personal experience). I call this the Princess and the Pea Effect.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think this is just a jewish thing. Anything that anybody does in this
<BR>
world is gonna make somebody hate them for it. Everyone here knows that there is
<BR>
plenty for the world to hate me for that has nothing to do with my familial
<BR>
relationship with jews.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another Toy idea is that Jews represent (to haters) the possible existence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a God, and one that the hater is really pissed off at, rather then their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; model. I rather like that one myself. Oh well.
</EM><BR>
<P>This seems to have some consonance. It jives with how many of the more
<BR>
radical/fundamentalist religious people frequently try to deny that
<BR>
Yahweh/God/Allah are all the same deity. If Yahweh isn't God, then its easier
<BR>
for them to hate Jews while still loving their own God.
