<P><EM>&gt; (I dislike the term &quot;capitalist&quot;--the

<EM>&gt; term was coined by Karl Marx, who understood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing about human capital.)
</EM><BR>
<P>A bit extreme, what!
<BR>
<P>Marx boned a LOT of things, and I'm constantly amazed that there
<BR>
are so many people who call themselves Marxists without any
<BR>
irony or qualification (neo-, quasi-, etc.).
<BR>
<P>That said, the idea that Marx understood nothing about human
<BR>
capital would be extremely difficult to defend.
<BR>
<P>If you have a moment, perhaps you could say a bit more. For
<BR>
example, is it the shift away from Hegel's idealism towards
<BR>
materialism where you see the problem, or is it more in the
<BR>
&quot;purely&quot; (if there can be such a thing) economic sphere?
<BR>
<P>Marx's use of the notion of the &quot;species being&quot; may well amount
<BR>
to a &quot;specious being,&quot; as I used to say, but it's a fascinating
<BR>
transformation of Feuerbach's atheistic twist on Hegel. I
<BR>
ultimately don't agree with it, but it manifests a degree of
<BR>
understanding of human capital that far, far exceeds &quot;nothing.&quot;
<BR>
<P>(Sorry if I'm incorrectly attributing content to something that
<BR>
may have been more of a statement of membership in a political
<BR>
community -- as most, if not all, statements are!)
<BR>
<P>Best wishes,
<BR>
Brian.
