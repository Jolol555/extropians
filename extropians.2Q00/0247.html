Walford, MD; Dr. Atkins, MD, of diet fame; Ronald M Klatz, MD or one of the

many others that are working on life 
<BR>
extension.  Some of these seem to be awfully close to having a method of 
<BR>
extending life.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I think Walford, et al  have done good work with limited resources.  Most of
<BR>
the real money now is going to specific age-related diseases like
<BR>
alzheimers.  Longevity research in general is still seen, IMHO, as fringe
<BR>
science by the big boys, but I thinks its slowly getting better.  Here's a
<BR>
good example. this research dovetails nicely with Walford and provides an
<BR>
explanation of WHY calorie restriction works.  This abstract is 3 years old,
<BR>
though, and I cant find any follow up stuff so far.  Anybody have a more
<BR>
recent reference on this line of research?

<BR>
<P>The underlying mechanism of calorie restriction (CR) extension of mammalian
<BR>
life spans operates
<BR>
by altering the rate of decline in reserve capacity (with time) as well as
<BR>
the exposure to growth
<BR>
stimulus, two mechanisms that seem to be related to the central genetically
<BR>
determined mechanism
<BR>
that controls mammalian life span over a 50-fold range. While genetic
<BR>
control is principally
<BR>
exerted at the level of metabolic rate and entrained protective defenses, CR
<BR>
appears to alter the
<BR>
rate of decline in reserve capacity and the exposure to growth stimulus
<BR>
without appreciable
<BR>
alteration of metabolic rate. CR accomplishes this by lowering the
<BR>
nutritionally driven level of
<BR>
insulin exposure, which in turn lowers overall growth factor exposure,
<BR>
improves age-declining
<BR>
maintenance of mitochondrial maximal function, and maintains a longer-term
<BR>
favorable balance of
<BR>
the insulin:growth hormone antagonism. Obtaining the 'halved' insulin
<BR>
exposure in
<BR>
calorie-restricted animals (relative to ad libitum fed) can be specifically
<BR>
targeted in non-obese ad libitum fed humans by multiple techniques, a
<BR>
situation that may confer most of the life span
<BR>
extension of CR without restricting calories. The prospect for even further
<BR>
extension of the human life span is considered.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&quot;In addition, a couple of years ago I saw an article that Geron, inc was 
<BR>
expected to produce a major step forward in life extension within the next 
<BR>
5-10 years or even sooner.&quot;
<BR>
Does anybody have any info on this?
<BR>
<P>&quot;    My problem is that I can read the literature but have no way of 
<BR>
distinguishing between the good and the bad.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has anyone else read any of the literature about the work of the life 
<BR>
extenders and have enough background to offer any guidance at all?  Comments
<BR>
<P>anyone?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Some folks doing solid research in longevity and ageing:
<BR>
<P>Rose at U.C. Irvine, extensive work with fruit flies.
<BR>
<P>Caleb Finch, Several books (very technical) about ageing
<BR>
<P>A female( Cathy Something?) at U.C. San Francisco, work with C. Elegans
<BR>
worms
<BR>
<P>Maybe we could all add to this list and then Anders could put it up on his
<BR>
new website so we could all have access to a high quality, filtered list of
<BR>
references on ageing and longevity research.
