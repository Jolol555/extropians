<P><EM>&gt; In response to Mr. Greg Burch,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       I am interested in which cross-section of society you wish to target 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  with your campaign.  Are you interested in including the whole population, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  just the few who are willing to strive for these wonderful advances in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; health 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and longevity? You wrote the following:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &quot;Although this cultural barrier has probably not yet thrown up any 
</EM><BR>
real 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  impediment to progress toward advances in human longevity or other kinds 
</EM><BR>
of 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  augmentation, the time will come fairly soon when it will.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>The answer to your question is &quot;both&quot;.  We need to target the researchers and 
<BR>
economic innovators who will actually do the work of extending human 
<BR>
longevity and augmenting the human animal because we need to encourage their 
<BR>
commitment to these goals.  But we also need to target the broader population 
<BR>
because we live in an increasingly consensual society and extropians 
<BR>
encourage the further development of such a society.  &quot;Public opinion&quot; counts 
<BR>
in a consensual society.  Beyond this, my personal values call for offering 
<BR>
the fruits of longevity research and development of human augmentation 
<BR>
technology to as many people as possible.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;       According to research conducted by the authors of the book, The Bell 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Curve, people from every race, creed, sex and religion that fall wihin the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  top 5% of the IQ curve have been quietly congregating.  During the past 
</EM><BR>
One 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Hundred years, certain neighborhoods, schools, professions, and companies 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  have naturally attracted this cognative elite(cognative elite is the term 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  used in THE BELL CURVE for those scoring in the top 5% on IQ tests) in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  natural march towards evolution.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't read &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; and, based on critiques of that book by 
<BR>
people whose opinions I respect, I doubt I will.  However, I certainly think 
<BR>
that capable people will tend to work together and choose to associate with 
<BR>
each other in a free society.  That seems to be a good thing.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;          After carefully reading several hundred responses to the Extropian 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  mailing list, it is my estimation that both the Transhuman and Extropian 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  groups are examples of the hypothesis The Bell Curve presents.  In other 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  words most people on this list would fit THE BELL CURVE'S definition of 
</EM><BR>
the 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  cognitive elite.
</EM><BR>
<P>We are a cognitive elite.  But there are other cognitive elites who don't 
<BR>
share our goals and values, and those other groups have the power to block 
<BR>
our progress to a greater or lesser extent.  We need to understand this and 
<BR>
learn to work with and around that reality.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;       My point is this: If the majority of the population has been unaware 
</EM><BR>
of 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  a social trend that has been occuring for at least One Hundred years, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  feel they will cause unnecessary and uninformed impediments for your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  suggested movement, why waste time bringing their attention to such a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  project? If so many are asleep at the wheel of life, why try to encourage 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  them to support the &quot;Advances in human longevity&quot;? This suggestion may 
</EM><BR>
sound 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  terriably elitist, and I do not intend it to be so, but this type of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  innovative thinking has historically been quelled from many secters.  
</EM><BR>
Maybe 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  it is time for those who wish to acquire health and longevity to do just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that? Let the people who are satisfied with the &quot;natural human life-span&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  continue to live with their comfortable thinking.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, to the extent that I think that people should be allowed to make 
<BR>
informed choices about what they do with their lives.  But I conclude that 
<BR>
spreading our goals and values to a wider sphere will be good for the people 
<BR>
who already hold those goals and values.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another    
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;
