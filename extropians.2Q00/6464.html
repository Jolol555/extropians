<P>There's something odd.  I did a Google search for &quot;Green party&quot;, and the above

site is only sixth.  The first is
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.greenparties.org/GreenParties/default.asp">http://www.greenparties.org/GreenParties/default.asp</A>
<BR>
the national associate of state Green Parties
<BR>
<P>and the platform there, while not joyous, was rather different than the one at
<BR>
greeparty.org.  The minimum wage there is &quot;at least $1 more&quot;, not $12.50;
<BR>
there's no mention of a 30-hour work week (which greenparty.org also has) or a
<BR>
maximum wage; and a single item endorses both citizens bearing arms for
<BR>
self-defense and the Brady Bill.  (Which is not a logically inconsistent
<BR>
position.  It may or may not be disingenuous, but it isn't contradictory, and
<BR>
pipsqueak parties like the Greens or Libertarians are more likely than most to
<BR>
follow some form of logic regardless of practical connotations.)

Abolish the military!
<BR>
<P>But the Green Party of Califonia has its own platform, which calls for
<BR>
reducing the military by 75%.  Radical, and calling for a rather different
<BR>
international role for the US, but not a priori insane.  In fact, the LP might
<BR>
well agree; less foreign involvement, less pissing other people off, more
<BR>
reliance on the natural moat.
<BR>
<P>And to be fair, party platforms tend to be a lot of noise to whip up activists
<BR>
or make party members feel important.
<BR>
<P>I think the real lesson I'm taking away, though, is that the Greens are not a
<BR>
centralized bunch.
