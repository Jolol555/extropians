<P>
One of Eliezer's more speculative ideas is that there could be a &quot;cortex&quot;
<BR>
in the AI which specializes in code (that is, in computer programs), in
<BR>
the same sense that we have brain structures that specialize in hearing
<BR>
and vision.
<BR>
<P>I have never understood this.
<BR>
<P>It reminds me a little of the &quot;watchmakers&quot; in Niven and Pournelle's
<BR>
Motie novels.  These were beasties which had evolved so that their
<BR>
natural environment was industrial civilization.  They had instincts
<BR>
to manipulate the artificial world similar to how most animals can
<BR>
live in the natural world.  The story makes it clear that they are not
<BR>
intelligent, just animals working by instinct.
<BR>
<P>Loose on the human ships, the watchmakers are able to improve a coffee
<BR>
maker to produce the best tasting coffee imaginable.  They've never had
<BR>
coffee, the Moties don't drink coffee, but somehow these animals are
<BR>
instinctively able to change the coffee maker to make it work &quot;better&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The watchmakers also improve the human's force-field technology (similar
<BR>
to Star Trek shields), which no Motie has ever seen.  Where the regular
<BR>
shields eventually overload and expload, the watchmakers improve the
<BR>
device so that as the shields get too much energy, they expand and radiate
<BR>
it away.  The improved fields are vastly more effective in a conflict.
<BR>
<P>The watchmakers seem utterly implausible to me.  Industrial equipment
<BR>
works on the basis of complex logic that can't reasonably be understood
<BR>
by animals.  As a first step to improving a device, it is necessary
<BR>
to understand what it does.  There is no way an animal could do that,
<BR>
for a coffee maker or an energy shield.  How would they know what would
<BR>
make coffee taste better?  How would they know that expanding shields
<BR>
would protect ships longer?  It's impossible.
<BR>
<P>Eliezer's coding cortext doesn't seem much more likely.  I don't see
<BR>
how it could do more than strictly localized parsing and improvement,
<BR>
technologies we already have.  Beyond that requires a deep understanding
<BR>
of the purpose of code.  An unintelligent brain fragment won't be able
<BR>
to achieve this.
<BR>
<P>Is the coding cortext supposed to be more than an optimizing compiler?
<BR>
If so, I'd like to hear what it is going to be able to do, and how it
<BR>
will do it.
<BR>
