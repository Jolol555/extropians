<EM>&gt; &gt; I haven't read any reports on the Foresight Institute's confronting the

<EM>&gt;singularity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; conference, how was it?

<EM>&gt;There were some no-shows including Minsky and Kurzweil.
</EM><BR>
<P>Minsky was on PBS recently - a panel on the future of the internet, as I 
<BR>
recall.  He now puts the Singularity - as far as real AI - at about 2073, to 
<BR>
my surprise.

<EM>&gt;The food was pretty good :-) San Francisco was cold, and had waaay worse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;traffic than last time I was there in 96.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's scary!  In '95 I got rear-ended - er, I mean my motorcycle got 
<BR>
rear-ended with me on it (you have to be clear about these things when 
<BR>
you're discussing San Francisco).  I suppose that's clear enough.  I have 
<BR>
yet to hear of people having sex with motorcycles - altho now I'm starting 
<BR>
to think maybe I shouldn't put the suggestion out there.
