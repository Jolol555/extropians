<P>
[I'm finally finished with a period of many weeks that included a lot of 
<BR>
travel and work, so I'm just now catching up on correspondence.]
<BR>
<P>Regarding the Foresight Senior Associates gathering, there's been some 
<BR>
discussion of &quot;conference architecture&quot; over the last week or so and I 
<BR>
thought I'd throw my two cents in.  First, a big thanks to all the folks who 
<BR>
participated in the Foresight conference: I really enjoyed the chance to see 
<BR>
old friends again and to meet some for the first time (especially Damien and 
<BR>
Eliezer).  Second, I agree with the comments that have been made that the 
<BR>
multi-tracking form of the &quot;Group Genius&quot; architecture has some serious 
<BR>
weaknesses, as well as some strengths.  I know that Tanya, who was chiefly 
<BR>
responsible for organizing this year's conference, did a GREAT job, but was 
<BR>
also frustrated by trying to make sure that people got the most out of a 
<BR>
process that was always teetering on the brink between creative chaos and 
<BR>
total collapse.
<BR>
<P>I think the &quot;Group Genius&quot; form doesn't scale well.  I was involved in a 
<BR>
similar kind of program hosted by Arthur Anderson about two months ago.  That 
<BR>
two-day event had a much tighter focus than the Foresight events of the last 
<BR>
two years, had only about 30 people involved at the peak of its attendance, 
<BR>
and had a much higher ratio of &quot;support staff&quot; to &quot;substantive participants&quot;. 
<BR>
&nbsp;This event was a complete success in achieving its goals (review and 
<BR>
development of business strategy for a specific enterprise) but, even with 
<BR>
its tighter focus and smaller numbers, was a totally engrossing and draining 
<BR>
experience.  Trying to scale this architecture up to an event including 200+ 
<BR>
people and having multiple focii across a very broad range of topics, while 
<BR>
using a much lower ratio of support people, just doesn't work, IMO, at least 
<BR>
in regards to the goal of capturing and feeding back the &quot;work product&quot; of 
<BR>
various groups into the on-going process.  Perhaps if the process were spread 
<BR>
over a longer time period, it might work with the larger number of people, 
<BR>
but such a longer time period just isn't possible for busy people who are 
<BR>
coming to a central conference location from geographically dispersed areas.
<BR>
<P>There ARE some good things about the multi-track pattern of the last two 
<BR>
Foresight SA gatherings.  The small groups allow better opportunities for 
<BR>
interaction and insure that there is always something interesting going on 
<BR>
for everyone.
<BR>
<P>I can envision trying to get the best of both kinds of conference.  Perhaps a 
<BR>
traditional auditorium for single-speaker/panels with large-group audiences, 
<BR>
coupled with a separate, nearby area in which &quot;nodes&quot; could be set-up for 
<BR>
ad-hoc discussions.  The nodes MIGHT be labeled for use by people interested 
<BR>
in particular subjects.  These node areas would have comfortable chairs, 
<BR>
places to put up posters, whiteboards, etc.  
<BR>
<P>A &quot;conference architecture&quot; might be built around having only two large-group 
<BR>
presentations per day, and the rest of the time could be reserved for ad-hoc 
<BR>
discussions around the &quot;nodes&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Does this sound like a workable concept for EXTRO5?
