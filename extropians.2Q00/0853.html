<EM>&gt;In a message dated 4/6/00 12:24:23 AM Central Daylight Time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="mailto:spike66@ibm.net?Subject=Re:%20Professional%20witness%20(was%20Re:%20Transparency%20Debate:%20test%20case!)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000416072156.6432.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">spike66@ibm.net</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;writes:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Easy question, now consider we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  about to see the next round with the wearable computers.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  is 1980 all over again.  Then it was the new desktop computers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Now it is the palm pilots and their logical descendants the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  wearables.  Getting these gadgets and learning to use them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  will divide the haves from the have nots even more than now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Right?  You and I are cool with that because we are the techies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  I hope one of our sociologist gurus will speculate on where it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  all leads.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm no &quot;sociological guru&quot;, but I sure love to speculate :-)  In the short-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and intermediate-term, wearables with really good real-time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reality-augmentation agents could give their users a huge advantage in all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sorts of human activities.  They could also cause a kind of mental fatigue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for their users the like of which we've never seen before in human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experience.  Feel flooded with information and overwhelmed with the need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;keep up&quot; with all the channels of communication you have available to you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;now?  Just wait for the era of true ubiquitous telecommunications.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I wonder whether the earliest adopters of really capable wearables might 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experience a massive surge in competitive advantage simply because it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;take some time to work out the best balance of info-flow and basic monkey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ability to deal with the dataflood that will be available.  Perhaps by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time the early adopters work out just what a workable interface is like,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;price will be so low that a mass market will be able to afford them - sort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like what happened with PCs and the web.
</EM><BR>

<P>Or maybe, when you upload, you E-clone yourself into a new Microsoft, with
<BR>
special privileges for the original, such as allocating personal storage or
<BR>
access.  Then you let the &quot;grunt&quot; copies do all the work for you, without
<BR>
ever clueing them into the big picture.  After they've sweated and agonized
<BR>
over the mundane myriad details until they come up with resolutions or
<BR>
answers, then you reincorporte them into your mind, like an E-God absorbing
<BR>
the souls of the ones who deserve redemption....  ;)
<BR>
<P>The advantage goes not only to the fast and dense, but who can surf  
<BR>
intelligently and not drown in the hypertropic data relevancy crisis
<BR>
no ?
