<EM>&gt; &gt;  You want to end welfare?  OK, so do I.  But you have to give people the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  means with which to make their own way in the world.  If I'm ignorant,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poor, uneducated and unskilled and you kick me and my kids out into the streets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tostarve,youhavede facto turned me into a criminal.I will rob everyone in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  sight.  I will soon be caught and put in jail then, guess what?  Free room
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  and board on your dime again.  Nice solution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True. Social services fill a need and are provided because most people can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see the cause and effect of the spending vs. the state of affairs. This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the big dumb-dumb factor of Libertarian politics. It ignores causation. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asserts that &quot;things will work themselves out&quot; as soon as we stop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interfering.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pound foolish, penny wise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fact:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A full-blown Harvard Education costs a fraction of what it costs to house a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criminal from age fifteen for life. But some people don't want to pay a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; school tax to pay for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; K-12 education and God forbid one should provide childcare for a poor kid,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they'd much rather wait and pay their tax bucks to punish him after he's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; killed a cop or a store clerk -- or perhaps their mom.
</EM><BR>
<P>Taxing working families till they can't afford to send their kids to
<BR>
state college, not even Harvard, in order to support career welfare
<BR>
recipients only makes sure the kids of the working families are more
<BR>
likely to be criminals too.
<BR>
<P>The average high school graduate in 1920 was more literate than the
<BR>
typical college graduate today.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's another political incongruity:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most people who are pro-life (antiabortion) are FOR the death penalty.
</EM><BR>
<P>You only deserve to die if you've proven you are unfit to live. The
<BR>
unborn haven't even been given the chance... a woman who aborts is
<BR>
admitting either that she will be an unfit mother, or that she has so
<BR>
little regard for the life of others. Either way, its a toss up. Do you
<BR>
want to put a baby in the hands of someone like that? I don't, which is
<BR>
why despite my misgivings about the morality of it, I think abortion is
<BR>
the lesser of two evils. By aborting, shes making sure there are fewer
<BR>
people like her (and the father) in the world. Abortion and execution: I
<BR>
just call it evolution in action.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ; - )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess it's OK to kill children, as long as you wait until they grow up --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unwanted and in poverty -- so they can kill someone else first!
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats the heart of &quot;innocent until proven guilty...&quot;
