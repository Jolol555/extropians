<EM>&gt; But I wasn't kidding about the Bay area house prices.

<EM>&gt; My sister sent me a small local newspaper from my old town La Honda
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; last weekend and WOW. The house prices have at least doubled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the last two years (on the way to tripling it looks like).
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Per the newspaper last week, the median house price in Santa Clara county
<BR>
(the heart of Silicon Valley proper) is now $577k.  That is USD$ for any
<BR>
who may have doubts.
<BR>
<P>That is an awful lot to pay for a very undistinguished house in very
<BR>
undistinguished neighborhoods; you certainly wouldn't think it was that
<BR>
expensive merely by looking at it.  A run-down beater of a house in the
<BR>
worst neighborhoods the place has to offer will set you back $300k.  I
<BR>
imagine a cardboard box under a bridge is pushing $50k.  For what you get,
<BR>
Santa Clara county is supposed to have the most expensive houses to be
<BR>
found in the U.S., even when you take into account all the usual suspects
<BR>
such as Beverly Hills, Carmel, etc.
<BR>
<P>Of course, that is the price you pay when local economics take a turn for
<BR>
the weird.  The Santa Clara county economy has a higher capitalized value
<BR>
than most European countries (a fact I liked to use to annoy the goons
<BR>
from France Telecom Corporate when they got uppity).  Many people in these
<BR>
parts can still afford to buy these houses, albeit marginally.
