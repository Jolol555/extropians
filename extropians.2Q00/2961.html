From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20a%20new%20thread&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000513071714.80223.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</A>&gt;

<BR>
| &gt; Any thoughts on human genetic manipulation?  Say, with the purpose of =
<BR>
| &gt; creating a workable interface between an electronic microprocessor and a
<BR>
=
<BR>
| &gt; human mind?  Throw in some nanotechnology for physical interaction...  =
<BR>
|
<BR>
<P>| How would genetic modifications of the genome create a good
<BR>
| brain-computer interface?
<BR>
<P>Earlier, I equated the concept to a structure similiar to the optic nerve.
<BR>
I now believe a better analogy would be the speech centres of the brain.  A
<BR>
new, specialized, neural structure along similiar lines would probably be
<BR>
appropriate - one suited to the purpose of interacting with one or more
<BR>
complex, high speed microprocessors.  Think of it as a client, or interface,
<BR>
into the microprocessor's &quot;human&quot; API.  The point is not to augment the
<BR>
brain to be able to handle computer instructions, but rather to augment it
<BR>
for more efficiect bidirectional communication with the aforementioned
<BR>
computer(s).  Most of the complex logic for interaction would be handled by
<BR>
the machine (as in real software) - the human part of the equation is simply
<BR>
communications.  These are obviously rough ideas, and I don't have the solid
<BR>
background in genetics/neurobiology that Anders obviously does...
<BR>
<P>|
<BR>
| I think we transhumanists have to be careful about our enthusiasm and
<BR>
| think carefully about the relative timeframes and levels of comelexity
<BR>
| needed to achieve certain things. Setting upp chemical gradients in
<BR>
| the brain so that engineered neurons growing on animplant can reach
<BR>
| the right areas seems doable in the relatively near future; creating a
<BR>
| nice socket on the skull through genetic engineering is much, much
<BR>
| harder (requires us to master localized morphogenesis). And of course,
<BR>
| nanotechnology is something completely different.
<BR>
<P>Here, you're jumping to conclusions based on my very brief initial
<BR>
statement.  I agree that a genetically hardcoded &quot;socket on the skull&quot; would
<BR>
be impractical, ineffient, aesthetically displeasing, inflexible and
<BR>
generally abhorrent.  Consider instead the speech centres; responsible for
<BR>
translating patterns of light and sound into recognizable values, and vice
<BR>
versa.  Is it not feasible that an enhanced speech centre could translate
<BR>
electronic signals along those same lines?  Is it also impossible to imagine
<BR>
general nervous system enhancements which could help deliver these signals
<BR>
to and from this modifed speech center?  Then there's the nanotech piece -
<BR>
simply binding these nervous system enhancements to a mechanical
<BR>
interface...
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I'm not saying &quot;this should be a simple project, let's have a
<BR>
prototype ready in 6 months&quot;, I'm asking &quot;what do you think about this
<BR>
idea?&quot;.  I don't deserve a critical lecture...  Besides, are we focused only
<BR>
on items which will be achievable within our lifetimes?
<BR>
<P>|
<BR>
| &gt; Education equates to software development...  Implications?
<BR>
|
<BR>
| As The Great Cathulhu pointed out, the similarities are small. I would
<BR>
| actually say practically zero. Software development has a definite
<BR>
| goal, which is sought using various methodologies building a
<BR>
| system. Education has a very loose goal of creating a great adult
<BR>
| human being, but is an interaction between a learning agent and an
<BR>
| environment where other agents try to achieve this goal.
<BR>
<P>Earlier I also clarified my supposition on sw vs. education - the gist:
<BR>
software development is to a machine what learning is to a human, in a very
<BR>
specific sense.  When programming a machine, you're defining specific
<BR>
reactions to stimuli (events).  Experience/learning have a similiar effect
<BR>
on a human child - given, the environment is more... anomalous.  Consider
<BR>
though, the process of teaching a child to read.  First, constants are
<BR>
clearly defined (alphabet).  Next, a structure is developed for storing
<BR>
groupings of these constants (words) - sound anything like a database
<BR>
schema?  Then, rules (logic) are developed which determine how words (and
<BR>
series of words - sentences) should be interpreted...  As you implied, there
<BR>
is probably a difference between teaching a set of rules to a child, and
<BR>
teaching them &quot;how to think&quot; - I'm only suggestiong the similiarity of the
<BR>
former to software development.
<BR>
<P>|
<BR>
| This goes both for todays humans and for augmented humans tomorrow -
<BR>
| if I had a chip in my head providing instant access to information
<BR>
| when I was a small kid, it would still just have been a high-potence
<BR>
| information source I had to integrate into my growing cognitive
<BR>
| network. If an augmented human can be designed like a software
<BR>
| project, then either the entities doing the project are of such a high
<BR>
| order of capability that they are definitely posthuman, or the
<BR>
| &quot;augmented&quot; human will be extremely simple and predictable. True
<BR>
| learning and education is a synthesis of various forms of information
<BR>
| into new and useful cognitive patterns. This is unpredictable and
<BR>
| highly individual - even simple neural networks develop different
<BR>
| internal representations when you train them in different runs.
<BR>
|
<BR>
<P>I *completely* agree - I am not suggesting we apply software methodologies
<BR>
to human development, quite the opposite.  We would simply be &quot;training&quot; any
<BR>
mentally enhanced structures using the same tool that is currently used for
<BR>
other aspects of mental development - learning.
<BR>
<P>| I think gardening is the best metaphor I can come up with for
<BR>
| education right now.
