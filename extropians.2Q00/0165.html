Hi Robert,
<BR>
<P>Thank you for your reply and advise (though I think we had 
<BR>
this discussion before months ago:-)  Lately I've been 
<BR>
swamped with work and really don't have any time to do 
<BR>
anything so I apologize for the very late response (or any 
<BR>
messages I have not read at all).  Perhaps some day I can 
<BR>
participate more in discussion.
<BR>
<P>Until then.
<BR>
<P>Clint O'Dell

<P><EM>&gt; Are you talking about Calvin as in the comic strip?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, William Calvin, a neuroscientist at the Univ. of 
<BR>
Washington.
<BR>
<P>He has written several books, &quot;The Cerebral Code&quot;, and &quot;How
<BR>
Brains think&quot;.  These are very educational as to one 
<BR>
plausible
<BR>
suggestion as to how thoughts &quot;work&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is Crick the guys last name?  I'm at the school library 
</EM><BR>
right now.  So if 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you could clarify a bit who I should look up, I would love 
</EM><BR>
to read them.
<BR>
<P>Francis Crick, &quot;The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific 
<BR>
Search
<BR>
for the Soul&quot;.  A fascinating discsussion as to how parts of 
<BR>
the
<BR>
brain work and how specific parts of the brain generate 
<BR>
things
<BR>
we thing are &quot;magical&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Wow!  If you define a person by what they read (not saying 
</EM><BR>
you do)
<BR>
<EM>&gt; then we are radically different.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, absolutely not.  But what you have read [input] 
<BR>
contributes
<BR>
to a strong degree how you think, and for the people who 
<BR>
want
<BR>
to understand that, understanding the history is useful.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've read a lot of fantasy, and a little bit of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science fiction, but for the last few years I had only 
</EM><BR>
read books on 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; programming, networking, and hardware.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think my list runs across all of the above at various 
<BR>
points in
<BR>
my life.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I lost interest with my computer geekness and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started studying government, mathematical logic, and 
</EM><BR>
biology.
<BR>
<P>Attempt to merge computer &quot;geekness&quot; and &quot;biology&quot;.  It is 
<BR>
the
<BR>
cross-pollination between the divisions that is necessary 
<BR>
for
<BR>
advancement at this point.  The biologists don't understand 
<BR>
(usually)
<BR>
that genomes are programs.  That observation is highly 
<BR>
enlightening
<BR>
and empowering.
<BR>
<P>Re: neuroscience/medicine, etc.
<BR>
<P>I would not encourage you to go too far in that direction.  
<BR>
We do
<BR>
not really have the tools yet to do really understand 
<BR>
&quot;thinking&quot;.
<BR>
At the same time we do have the tools to understand how 
<BR>
genomic
<BR>
programs create &quot;organisms&quot; (with thousands of unknown genes
<BR>
in the equations).  If you are computer comfortable, for the
<BR>
next 10+ years, the application of principles of computer 
<BR>
science
<BR>
to understanding genomes will be a very lucrative field with
<BR>
many interesting opportunities.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Again, wow!  It is interesting to meet someone who has 
</EM><BR>
thought at one time 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the same basic way I did when I was younger.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suspect we may not be alone.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I truly didn't believe that genius is something you're 
</EM><BR>
born with.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately we live in a country that wants to perpetuate 
<BR>
that
<BR>
we are all equal.  That is hogwash.  We all have distinct 
<BR>
and individual
<BR>
*advantages* and *disadvantages*, and the &quot;masters&quot; are the 
<BR>
people who
<BR>
learn to utilise the former and overcome the latter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I still just can't throw away my idea of genius being 
</EM><BR>
taught as a point
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of view.  My suggestion of why that gene does what it does 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that it allows the brain to perform more 
</EM><BR>
efficient/quickly.  This allows 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; someone to &quot;catch on&quot; easier than others.
</EM><BR>
<P>My perspective is that a great deal of it has to do with
<BR>
&nbsp;(a) rate of acquiring information -- the faster you can lay
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down the memories, the more intelligent you *appear* to 
<BR>
be.  That
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says nothing about how intelligent you really are, 
<BR>
since the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person with discipline and perserverence may put down 
<BR>
just
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as many memories as the person who reads something once 
<BR>
and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remembers.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;(b) The abilities to both (a) concentrate to the exclusion 
<BR>
of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything else (hunger, thirst, etc.); and (b) hold in 
<BR>
the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mind simultaneously many thoughts allowing them to 
<BR>
intermingle
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with each other; these are both quite interesting 
<BR>
cognitive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abilities that have distinct advantages for some mental 
<BR>
operations.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
There is a saying I'm fond of from Eastern philosophy that
<BR>
relates to (b[b]) -- &quot;The barriers to enlightenment are the
<BR>
ability to hold both confusion and paradox in the mind&quot;.
<BR>
Most of the time the mind strives for a dominant 
<BR>
&quot;conclusion&quot;,
<BR>
the ability to postpone that and allow more time for things
<BR>
to cross-fertilize is probably a key feature of creativity.
<BR>
<P>I suspect (a) &amp; (b[a] and (b[b]) are highly genetic in 
<BR>
nature.
<BR>
Time will tell.
