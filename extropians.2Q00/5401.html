<P>
The press said that antiballistic missile system they'd like, no need to
<BR>
build would intercept in the ascent stage of the missile's flight, NOT the
<BR>
Reaganesque Star Wars bubble that would stop the rain of Soviet warheads on
<BR>
the way down.
<BR>
<P>Consider this.  A ship full of illegal chinese immigrants runs itself
<BR>
aground on the shore of New Jersey. (old news) The Navy didn't intercept
<BR>
this ship, the Coast Guard didn't intercept this ship, the spy satellites
<BR>
didn't detect the ship (in time, but probably had pics seen later of its
<BR>
course, speed and final location stuck on the beach) and there are literally
<BR>
thousands of ships plying the coasts of the US and oh by the way, the coasts
<BR>
of all of our Allies.  What about them?
<BR>
<P>All a so-called rouge nation, faction, or religous group fundamentalist
<BR>
Christian group or otherwise, need do is pull up to the coast of a nation,
<BR>
errect the very short range missile launcher on its deck and push the
<BR>
button.
<BR>
<P>Batteries of the latest and greatest Patriot, ABL, GBL, even Texas Air
<BR>
National Guardsmen shoulder to shoulder with Stingers would likely not bring
<BR>
it down.  It would go where, or close enough to where ever they wanted it to
<BR>
go with NBorC warheads.  And believe me a small cell of fundamentalists
<BR>
trained, educated and who had just vacationed in the US with their latest
<BR>
GPS locator, will not feel &quot;put out&quot; by the US government funding an ABM
<BR>
system.  Their goal is not like the former Soviets to go toe to toe with the
<BR>
US, it will be to make a point.  And they'll give it their best Midwest
<BR>
University try and they won't care if the first one doesn't hit pay dirt.
<BR>
<P>Terrorism (read rouge nation) is a different animal than world domination by
<BR>
a totalitarian government system.  They aren't sweating a national economic
<BR>
situation on their homefront.  They have funding sources like BinLadin and a
<BR>
dream of rocking the world, not taking it over.
<BR>
<P>Get off the Star Wars dream, this is not the 70s, 80s, or 90s.  It is a
<BR>
different world.  Spend the money and devote the research elsewhere.  Design
<BR>
a stealth patrol car for the Kansas State Police.

</EM><BR>
<P>All of the literature I've seen, dating back to 1985 or so, focuses 
<BR>
on boost phase interception. While terminal phase interception was 
<BR>
always looked at, the core of the SDI programs was not hitting 
<BR>
individual RVs.

<P>The currently envisioned program is focused on medium and long range 
<BR>
ballistic missiles, not Katayusha(sp?) or FROG type weapons but 
<BR>
Scud-type weapons and larger. The percieved threat is nations like 
<BR>
North Korea and Iran which are actively developing both long range 
<BR>
ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
<BR>
<P>For short range threats, things like THEL exist, and are not part of 
<BR>
the ABM system(s) that are causing so much controversy.

</EM><BR>
<P>A terrorist is far more likely to use a delivery system simpler than 
<BR>
a missile. For example, terrorists both in the US and abroad have 
<BR>
already used not only trucks but salad bars and buildings as delivery 
<BR>
systems for biological agents. A terrorist would have to be rich and 
<BR>
foolish to use a missile.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Terrorism (read rouge nation)
</EM><BR>
<P>Terrorism and rogue nations may sometimes go hand in hand, but they 
<BR>
are NOT the same thing. The threat the ABM system is design to 
<BR>
counter is not a terrorist hijacking a road mobile ICBM like some 
<BR>
kind of bad HBO movie but to counter nation states from developing 
<BR>
and deploying medium and long range ballistic missiles capable of 
<BR>
hitting the continental United States (and for ship-borne ABM 
<BR>
systems, other places as well).
<BR>
<P>Terrorists hide bombs in luggage, they don't buy/build/steal SA-10 
<BR>
systems and shoot down airliners. The modern terrorist has far more 
<BR>
useful deliery methods of the agents at their disposal than a 
<BR>
ballistic missile.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Get off the Star Wars dream, this is not the 70s, 80s, or 90s.  It is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different world.  Spend the money and devote the research elsewhere.  Design
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<P>You seem to overlook that SDI has been cited by both Russian and 
<BR>
American officials as one of the driving forces behind the changes 
<BR>
that lead to the fall of the Soviet Union. Strategic weapons and 
<BR>
defense systems are far more political and economic than military.
