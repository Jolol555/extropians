<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;The only protection offered against illegitimate use of deadly force in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;the U.S. is to kill the state agents/police at the time the incident
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;occurs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Murder is *already* a capital offense, even if you are wearing a cop 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;uniform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at the time you commit the murder.  So I assume what you are suggesting 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some sort of summary execution which bypasses the jury trial process, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   That sounds like a really great plan.  Oh, except for the minor detail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that *no one in their right mind would become a cop*. I'm amazed that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can hire people as cops now to get paid marginally well to risk their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; every working hour of the day.  And now, in addition to getting 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reprimanded,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suspended, fired and sued for making an error, you think they should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *killed* too?  Yeah, sure I might take that job...if it paid $10 million 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; year.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is legal *now*, and always has been; I wasn't making a suggestion.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is considered self-defense if you kill a cop executing illegal force,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whether the use of illegal force is accidental or intentional.  The moment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone threatens lethal force against you without correct legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;authority, they become fair game in the eyes of the law whether or not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they come under the color of authority.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh.  I didn't get that you were talking about good old fashioned 
<BR>
self-defense.  I thought you were talking about some sort of summary 
<BR>
execution tribunal where the cop's punishment for a bad shooting would be 
<BR>
execution.  Sure, self-defense is always legal.  Although I have my doubts 
<BR>
about its practicality when it comes to fending off armed cops.  Especially 
<BR>
when I think of Ruby Ridge.
<BR>
<P>Personally I don't think I'd stand a chance against 3 or 4 cops with their 
<BR>
guns already drawn.  Especially if I didn't have any forewarning that they 
<BR>
were coming.
