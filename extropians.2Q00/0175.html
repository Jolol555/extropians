</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; But only in that most courts today seem to have total ignorance or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  distain for the 9th Amendment, and are drifting away from the founders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  concepts of Natural Law. Under the 9th, any rights not enumerated in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  Constitution are retained by the people, as individuals, so it follows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  that since privacy is not explicitly mentioned, it is a 9th Amendment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't read the IXth ammendment this way.  The text says:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;           The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;           shall not be construed to deny or disparage others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;           retained by the people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm no constitutional law scholar, but this just seems to say &quot;The fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a subject is addressed in the Constitution doesn't mean that it excludes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; other rights the people may have,&quot; or alternatively, &quot;the Constitution is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; an exhaustive enumeration of rights.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The way I read it is that any rights addressed by name in the Constitution do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exceed or override any rights the people may posess which are not named in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Constitution. The 9th amendment deals with rights, while the Xth deals with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; POWERS, not rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Are you thinking of the Xth ammendment?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;              The powers not delegated to the United States
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;              by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;              are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Which I have always taken to simply mean that the Founders intended that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; federal government be a LIMITED government, with only explicitly enumerated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; powers.  (The Xth ammendment has always seemed a little foggy in it's last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; clause -- probably intentionally so -- as to the division of power between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people and states . . .)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Because it deals with powers, not rights, it deals with basically stating that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governmental powers outside of those dealt with in the constitution, are to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hashed out by the citizens of the respective states as to whether those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governmental powers are to be managed at the state or local level, as they choose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to define it in their state constitutions and laws.
</EM><BR>
<P>The only powers of the government (in the U.S.) are those given it by its citizenry.
<BR>
We have the Constitution to describe how this is done, and the government which does
<BR>
what it can get away with and more.
<BR>
<P>So, besides Constitutional scholarship, we need to take a cold, hard look at what
<BR>
travesties of justice and freedom that some elements of the government have and will
<BR>
attempt to inflict upon the citizenry, fight against these attacks upon freedom and
<BR>
see them eliminated, and be ever vigilant against tyranny.
<BR>
<P>The Constitution may be amended by popular vote, this was put into the Constitution
<BR>
in one regard to enable the people to enact amendments to the Constitution regardless
<BR>
to what may have been a corrupt or unresponsive legislature or executive branch.
<BR>
<P>So, maybe it is perhaps more an appropriate time to consider some more rights that
<BR>
people hold to be self-evident and explicitly enumerate them.  One is privacy, and
<BR>
then all those who do not gain from exploiting the privacy of others will be in
<BR>
better shape.  Something like: &quot;the citizens shall have the right to be free of
<BR>
exploitation of their privacy&quot; or &quot;the people have the right to a rational level of
<BR>
privacy&quot;.  In the turn-of-phrase aof number I, &quot;the Congress shall make no law nor
<BR>
allow governmental action which abridges the right to privacy.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Personally, on a separate issue, I am trying to figure out how to bill any such spam
<BR>
that comes my way.  Accoding to the fax machine law, people sent unsolicited faxes
<BR>
are able to recoup their damages or $500, whatever is more, this law was extended to
<BR>
modems and other electronic devices.  So, there could be a series of class actions
<BR>
against largely unnamed spamming defendants, so whenever one receives an unsolicited
<BR>
unagreed upon spam then that could be forwarded to the spam reward reclamation
<BR>
center, where the sender of spam would be determined by forwarding mailer and then
<BR>
summarily a motion for $500 for each spam e-mail or damages, whichever is greater,
<BR>
filed against them in their local jurisdiction by electronic form.
<BR>
<P>An interesting set of four letters:  copr.
