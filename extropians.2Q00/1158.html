<EM>&gt; ...or of stopping it long before it becomes &quot;mass&quot;.  I'd like it if every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high school had some kind of gun-owner club, whose members carried
</EM><BR>
handguns
<BR>
<EM>&gt; on their persons all day.  Any sign of recklessness and a student would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expelled from the club.  That way, if some wackos want to kill 13 people,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they'll probably be killed after the first couple shots they fire, by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fellow students.  And, while we're at it, if some 15-year-old girls are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going into the city to watch a movie, I'd sure want them to have guns,
</EM><BR>
even
<BR>
<EM>&gt; if their training is only minimal.  Last time I checked, rapists didn't go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of their way to avoid minors.  But they probably do prefer to avoid
</EM><BR>
guns.
<BR>
<P>Yow, imagine if those big, dumb, aggressive kids from school had all been
<BR>
toting handguns legally on school grounds? They'd be the ones attracted to
<BR>
it. I went to a rural school; those farm boys know which end is the
<BR>
dangerous end. Some of those same kids are too dumb to understand cause and
<BR>
effect (remember back to the real idiots). Teens in general are not noted
<BR>
for long term thinking.
<BR>
<P>I wouldn't be sending my kids to that school!
