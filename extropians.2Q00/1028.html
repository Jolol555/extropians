Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>On the Cryonet Rudi Hoffman really got on the case of all those who are not 
<BR>
signed up for cryonics but post like they are(me??).  I had to respond due 
<BR>
to all my guilt.
<BR>
<P>Come to think of it, I have yet to pay up and join the Extropian Institute!  
<BR>
I hope Max and Greg don't read this!
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>

Many people reading this posting this very moment, however, do not have 
<BR>
funding in place to make their suspension a reality.  I am amazed at this.  
<BR>
Many people who post regularly here-- and are often even highly 
<BR>
opinionate--are &quot;closet corpses&quot; who in reality do not have solid funding in 
<BR>
place.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Rudi, I am feeling so guilty!!  I am one of those &quot;closet corpses&quot; who post 
<BR>
regularly!
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
Dave Pizer, (and I know that because you are fellow business man you already 
<BR>
know this), please know that many people may have an opinion about cryonics 
<BR>
and community, but on the part of many cryonicists there is an unfortunate 
<BR>
lack of &quot;follow through&quot; when it comes to actually putting even relatively 
<BR>
small amounts of money to make dreams reality.  How do I know that there are 
<BR>
dilettantes and hypocrites (for lack of better word) who regularly post 
<BR>
here?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Do you mean cryonicists putting forth money to fund research?  Ranging from 
<BR>
those who are multi-millioniares to middle-class?  Saints Saul Kent and Wil 
<BR>
Faloon being the notable and blessed exceptions?
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
I know this because I have had the opportunity to correspond with quite a 
<BR>
few people who are regular contributors to this board.  These hypocrites 
<BR>
have initiated correspondence with me regarding funding.  BUT...THEY have 
<BR>
NEVER followed through, with me or other insurance vendors.  I know this 
<BR>
through checking with Linda Chamberlain (Alcor) and Andy Zawacki (Cryonics 
<BR>
Institute).
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I am one of those people who have initiated contact with you regarding a 
<BR>
life insurance policy but NEVER followed through.  I apologize.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
Since we are talking monthly commitments that may be only $18 or $50 or $150 
<BR>
dollars per month, it is highly unlikely that they have set $120,000 aside 
<BR>
to fund their suspensions.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Very, very unlikely!!
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
I take my commitments seriously.  Most of you do as well.  I use my valuable 
<BR>
time, professionalism, toll free number, overnight mail costs, and the 
<BR>
tremendous effort it takes to get appropriate, detailed,  and affordable 
<BR>
proposals to people who have inquired.  All this is to make their dream of 
<BR>
biostasis (and potential immortality) a REALITY for individuals.
<BR>
<P>And I am usually rewarded with equal candor, reliability, and responsibility 
<BR>
by the responders.  There are others who are attracted to cryonics, however, 
<BR>
who are ASTONISHINGLY unreliable, have NO sense of business realities, and 
<BR>
who will try to soak up your time like a sponge while they &quot;hold court&quot; 
<BR>
telling you  how you should do things.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>In helping me Rudi you employed your 800 number, acquired shipping and 
<BR>
postage costs, and used your valuable time to try to get me signed up at my 
<BR>
own request.  And you were a friend who took the time to get to know me as 
<BR>
you did these things.  I sincerely apologize.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
Dave, I know you are well aware of this &quot;flake&quot; syndrome.
<BR>
By the way, my wife fondly refers to many cryonicists as &quot;Frosted Flakes&quot;.  
<BR>
Some are flakier than others! :)  Many reading this posting this very moment 
<BR>
consider themselves &quot;cryonicists&quot; but have done ZERO to establish their 
<BR>
funding!
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I like the term your wife came up with.  I remember reading posts by various 
<BR>
prominent cryonicists about how cryonics can attract the &quot;socially 
<BR>
challenged&quot; and this would make it harder to attract people with a higher 
<BR>
E.Q.! lol
<BR>
<P>I am a &quot;Frosted Flake&quot; of the extra flaky variety! lol  I have done nearly 
<BR>
zero myself to establish funding for myself.  Contacting you was the first 
<BR>
big step but I did not follow-up on it.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
If they live outside the United States this is understandable, as obtaining 
<BR>
life insurance for the purpose of cryonic suspension is EXTREMELY difficult 
<BR>
outside the United States.  (I am the leading writer of cryostasis policies 
<BR>
in the world, and I do NOT have any carriers that will write outside of the 
<BR>
country.  Although I am working on it diligently.  Thanks for the continued 
<BR>
&quot;Non United States&quot; inquiries, but I cannot write you yet!)
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I am very fortunate to be living in the United States and be able to take 
<BR>
advantage of what is here.  Though living in Alaska puts me at the outer 
<BR>
boundary of things.
<BR>
<P>you end with:
<BR>
The above &quot;rant&quot; is hereby concluded. :)
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Thank goodness!  I am feeling very guilty right now, but that is as it 
<BR>
should be.  Rudi, I showed interest in what you offer as an insurance 
<BR>
professional and with the best of intentions but being a $$ poor student 
<BR>
without a solid job interfered with things.  Still, I should have stayed in 
<BR>
touch and not let things slide as I did.
<BR>
<P>I am not done with college yet but I am working nearly full time now.  So, I 
<BR>
can shortly reconnect with you and this time really get a life insurance 
<BR>
policy to achieve the main goal of a cryonics policy.
<BR>
<P>I feel like Cryonet is the equivalent of watching a PBS fundraising drive!!  
<BR>
As time goes by I get to feeling guiltier and guiltier, until I have to 
<BR>
donate some money!  Actually, come to think of it, I feel guilty but never 
<BR>
donate any money at all!!!
<BR>
<P>As the old saying goes &quot;I needed that!&quot;  Your words were a pail of ice cold 
<BR>
water splashed in my face that was for the best.
<BR>
<P>Yesterday was my birthday.  I turned the big &quot;thirty-three!&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
