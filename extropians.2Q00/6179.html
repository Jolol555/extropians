<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; I imagine, from the way you have conducted

<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; yourself here, that you are the sort of person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; who gives thanks every day for the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; duels are no longer legal means of settling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; personal disputes of honor. If you conduct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; yourself in your real interpersonal relations as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt; you have here, I would imagine that you would

<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; not last long in such an environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike, I am continually amazed at how you turn every conversation into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a discussion about guns.  In the last little bit, you have steered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dozens of threads to the topic of guns.  You must think about them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; day and night.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not at all, although you do tend to seem to try to turn every comment I
<BR>
make into some sort of test or means of impunging me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When someone asked about &quot;wearable&quot; computers, you responded about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wearable guns. 
</EM><BR>
<P>No, nobody said 'computers' specifically.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When someone referred back to Y2K bugs, your referred
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back to stashing guns. 
</EM><BR>
<P>A large number of people who were greatly concerned about extensive
<BR>
effects of uncorrected y2k bugs were stashing large quantities of
<BR>
survival equipment and supplies, many of whom were people intimately
<BR>
involved in the 'y2k industry', so they were presumably the people most
<BR>
in the know about it. What makes me so different?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When someone asked about claiming the moon,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you responded with the role of guns in the history of land disputes.
</EM><BR>
<P>thats not at all what I responded, and while I may have made a comment
<BR>
to that effect, it was a minor one. It seems you have an obsession about
<BR>
any time someone else talks about guns. Are you that hoplophobic?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When someone compared political systems, you responded about how the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Communists and Nazis banned guns. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Someone made comments about how our political system is not so different
<BR>
from theirs, however the gun issue IS a very good litmus test to
<BR>
demonstrated which systems trust their citizens and which don't. I'm not
<BR>
the only person who has made this comparison either, however your
<BR>
singling me out indicates some sort of obsessive vandetta on your part.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When someone complained about bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statistics, you complained about bad gun statistics.
</EM><BR>
<P>WHich is a very good example of how political groups lie with
<BR>
statistics, only because anti-gunners lie so much, and because guns are
<BR>
a very hot topic in the court of public opinion right now. The fact that
<BR>
the media seems dead set against guns is programming a lot of people
<BR>
with false and negative information about guns and gun rights, which
<BR>
needs to be extinguished with truth.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  When someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointed out crime statistics, you pointed out gun-control statistics.
</EM><BR>
<P>Because the two are closely intermeshed, as any idiot who knows anything
<BR>
about crime can tell you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When someone described touring Europe, you described gun-control in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Europe.  When someone got into an argument with Max and Natasha, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explain how guns could solve the problem.  When someone suggested a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Committee on Un-Extropian Activities,&quot; you mention your tendency to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shoot first and swear the carcass in later.  Why must every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conversation with you turn into a gun discussion?
</EM><BR>
<P>Why must every comment or quip be judged to be part of some sort of
<BR>
evidence in your little personal inquisition?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even if you don't mean to do this, are you aware that this is how it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appears?  Could you at least try to change the subject to include a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prefix of &quot;GUNS:&quot; when you do this?  That way people could filter out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;GUN:&quot; subjects instead of merely filtering out you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you aware how politically correct you sound and how much you sound
<BR>
like you are trying to launch an inquisition? If I talked, say, about
<BR>
trucks, would you even feel the slightest bit interested in my frequent
<BR>
comments about trucks (as is the case with EvMick)? Why do you seem to
<BR>
obsess about peoples comments about guns, but not about people's
<BR>
frequent comments about art (Natasha or Nadia), gardening (Bonnie), the
<BR>
law (Greg Burch), trucks (EvMick), Music or poetry (E Shaun Russell). It
<BR>
seems as though you have some unreasoning fear of guns, a hoplophobia.
<BR>
Perhaps you need to seek counseling...
