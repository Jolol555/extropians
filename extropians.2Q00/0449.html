<EM>&gt;&gt; This is argument by anonymous authority. I don't find it persuasive.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Actually, its argument by summary - I don't really have time to try to think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of every argument you might possibly want to advance, especially when I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;taking the side that almost all of the experts are on. If you think my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;generalizations are wrong, give me a specific example of how.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think monopolization is a problem and that intervention is in some
<BR>
instances beneficial. I'd be interested in discussing arguments
<BR>
that this is not the case, but simply asserting there exist unnamed
<BR>
experts who disagree with me isn't useful. I'm not going to do your
<BR>
research for you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;No, it doesn't. If Microsoft made all the most useful APIs in their OS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;secret it would help their applications division, but at the expense of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crippling their OS's ability to compete. Remember, anything Microsoft can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;implement, other OS vendors can also build. If those secret features are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually important, a competitor can make a mint by building public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;implementations of them.
</EM><BR>
<P>This would be true if there were competition. There isn't.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Microsoft does not own the hardware companies, and it does not have a magic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wand that controls the industry. If hardware vendors pre-install MS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;software, they do so because they thing their customers want them to.
</EM><BR>
<P>This would be true if vendors had some credible alternative to
<BR>
shipping Windows. They don't.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;No, it isn't. A large company can not gain a competitive advantage against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;smaller rivals by selling its product below cost. Why? Because the bigger it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is, the faster it looses money by dumping.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not true. The incremental cost of software is zero.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The problem is that an OS that doesn't run a customer's software is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worthless. Most customers care a lot more about their apps than they do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about their OS.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly. Since the software most people want to run is only available
<BR>
on Windows any other OS is worthless - regardless of it's other
<BR>
merits or technical superiority to Windows.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the benefits [of the Posix standard] were really all that great,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you wouldn't need a government mandate - people would be buying it on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their own.
</EM><BR>
<P>This gets into deeper game-theory questions. The consequence of
<BR>
individuals doing what is locally optimal isn't necessary the global
<BR>
optimum. (Nine out of ten dentists agree with me on this one.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Programming languages are another example. Because C is a public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; standard, I can choose compliers based on quality and appropriateness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to a particular task. The same can't be said for Visual Basic, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I'm lucky if my code is even portable across versions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There is an inevitable trade-off between backwards compatibility and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;innovation. If you value stability, write C code on Unix. If you value rapid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;improvement, use VB or another 4GL on Windows (or wait for MS's new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Intentional language, but that's another story).
</EM><BR>
<P>This reminds me. I forgot to mention vaporware as another monopolist's
<BR>
tool. But I'm not talking about backward compatibility - I'm talking about
<BR>
public standards. These are distinct.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But we don't have to agree. I'm perfectly willing to let people like you go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one using whatever OS and programming technology you prefer. I just want you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to extend the same courtesy to people like me. Just let everyone take the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;approach they prefer, and let the market decide which one works best.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure. Do what you want. I don't want to restrict your choice, I want
<BR>
to give you more options. Wouldn't you like to choose between
<BR>
different Windows or VB implementations? 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Because with 'features' you get incompatibility, and with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So, let's see, you're against features, you'd like to see innovation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stifled, and you think the government should make everyone use the same OS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Which agency did you say you worked for?
</EM><BR>
<P>You caught me. I'm a shill for the Man - the SS will be at your door
<BR>
anyday now. We're going to make you run CP/M. 
<BR>
<P>Anyway - I apologize if the above is a bit glib. I find this all
<BR>
somewhat tiresome. Doing a search on DejaNews will turn up gigabytes
<BR>
of variation on the arguments we've both advanced going back 10
<BR>
years. I think both our positions are clear, and I'm sure you find
<BR>
mine as ludicrous as I find yours. Do you see a middle ground we'd
<BR>
both be happy with - any room for constructive discussion?
