<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I see a lot of people pointing optimistically to some of the roadkill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the way to the fantasy of being able to hum and hear trumpets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's almost all roadkill.  It'll happen eventually, but it will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the result of using on the order of four different &quot;pitch-guessing&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;processes, and voting.  And to get that to work will require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recognizing the instrument used as input.
</EM><BR>
<P>I tend to agree, but I have not followed the music technology in
<BR>
the last several years, so I don't know the current state-of-the-art.
<BR>
<P>Three years ago I gave a really fun seminar to a group of smart
<BR>
folks who were interested in learning about wavelets; they had
<BR>
the ultimate goal of wanting to use wavelets for mixing instruments
<BR>
in music (for example, symphonic music). They wanted to analyze
<BR>
the sound of an orchestra, and arrive at a score for each
<BR>
instrument, then re-score it, and play it back.
<BR>
<P>Since I was just giving a &quot;beginners&quot; seminar, and I'm not a wavelet
<BR>
researcher, myself, I couldn't help them with their ultimate goal of
<BR>
isolating musical instruments with wavelets. But I did give their
<BR>
idea some thought, and I looked into the wavelets literature a
<BR>
little bit for them.
<BR>
<P>I believe that the wavelets could do very well with isolating individual
<BR>
syllables (as in speech), and wavelets are exceptional at isolating
<BR>
octaves of frequencies to remove, denoise, etc.
<BR>
<P>However to identify all trumpet sounds, for example, one would
<BR>
need to combine wavelets with a pattern recognition scheme, like
<BR>
with a neural net or some other classifying algorithm.
<BR>
<P>One response to your message said that this problem has been &quot;solved&quot;.
<BR>
If that's true, then I'd be very interested in the technical details.
<BR>
<P>Here is an abstract that I found 3 years ago that gave me some
<BR>
hints that the wavelet researchers were actively working on the problem.
<BR>
(I don't know the results of this particular piece of research.)
<BR>
<P>Have fun!

<P>Abstract: Music is a vital element in the process of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comprehending the world where we live and interact
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with. Frequently it exerts a subtle but expressive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;influence over a society's evolution line. Analysis and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;synthesis of music and musical instruments has always
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been associated with forefront technologies available
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at each period of human history, and there is no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surprise in witnessing now the use of digital
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technologies and sophisticated mathematical tools
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supporting its development. Fourier techniques have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been employed for years as a tool to analyze timbres'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spectral characteristics, and re-synthesize them from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these extracted parameters. Recently many modern
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations, based on spectral modeling techniques,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been leading to the development of new generations
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of music synthesizers, capable of reproducing natural
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sounds with high fidelity, and producing novel timbres
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as well. Wavelets are a promising tool on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development of new generations of music synthesizers,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counting on its advantages over the Fourier techniques
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in representing non-periodic and transient signals,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with complex fine textures, as found in music. In this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paper we propose and introduce the use of wavelets
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addressing its perspectives towards musical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applications. The central idea is to investigate the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capacities of wavelets in analyzing, extracting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;features and altering fine timbre components in a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiresolution time- scale, so as to produce high
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quality synthesized musical sounds.
