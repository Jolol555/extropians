I wonder if the principle of relativity is not weakened or compromised by
<BR>
the big bang theory. Doesn't the center-of-mass of the big bang, i.e., the
<BR>
center of mass of the cosmos,  define a privileged frame of reference?
<BR>
Doesn't motion in any other frame of reference produce a blue shift in the
<BR>
2.7 K black body background radiation in the direction of motion relative to
<BR>
center-of-mass and a red shift in the opposite direction?
<BR>

Subject:	Re: FTL transmission?
<BR>
<P>The theory of relativity did not start with the assumption that FTL
<BR>
travel was impossible.  Rather, it started with a much simpler assumption,
<BR>
called the &quot;principle of relativity&quot; (which is not the same as the theory
<BR>
of relativity).  This can be stated somewhat informally as:
<BR>
<P>The laws of physics are the same for moving observers as for stationary
<BR>
ones.
<BR>
<P>This principle is based on observations: in a smoothly moving frame of
<BR>
reference, there is no self-contained measurement you can do which will
<BR>
have a different result than if you were moving at a different speed.
<BR>
You can't reach out and &quot;feel space sliding by&quot; to tell that you are
<BR>
moving.
<BR>
<P>It follows from this that actually there is no such thing as a
<BR>
&quot;stationary&quot; observer; that is, motion is all relative.  If one person
<BR>
is moving with respect to another, each one has an equal claim to being
<BR>
stationary.
<BR>
<P>One of the things that has been found is that empty space has certain
<BR>
magnetic and electrical properties, which you can measure.  And further
<BR>
it turns out that it is possible to have waves travel through empty
<BR>
space which are made purely of electricity and magnetism.  These waves
<BR>
are the familiar electromagnetic radiation which we observe as light,
<BR>
radio, and so on.
<BR>
<P>The speed of these waves depends on the electrical and magnetic properties
<BR>
of space.  Based on the principle of relativity, we can say that both
<BR>
stationary and moving observers will measure these values to be the same.
<BR>
It follows that all observers will see electromagnetic waves travel at
<BR>
the same speed.  This speed is abbreviated &quot;c&quot;, and is called &quot;the speed
<BR>
of light&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Independently, puzzling experimental results were obtained which also
<BR>
pointed to the speed of light being the same for all moving frames of
<BR>
reference.  This was the Michelson-Morley experiment which measured
<BR>
the speed of light relative to the earth's motion around the sun.
<BR>
No difference was found in the speed regardless of which direction the
<BR>
earth is moving.
<BR>
<P>This result, by itself, is enough to begin to capture some of the
<BR>
paradoxes of relativity.  How can two people in motion relative to each
<BR>
other both measure the speed of a given beam of light to be the same?
<BR>
Our intuitive understanding would say that one of them would see the
<BR>
light to be moving faster than the other.  Yet experiments and argument
<BR>
imply that this does not happen.
<BR>
<P>Einstein's theory of relativity explores the implications of this effect
<BR>
in detail.  It is from this theory that we learn that measurements of
<BR>
time and distance are different for observers in motion.  This should
<BR>
not surprise us, because speed is distance divided by time, and we
<BR>
already have a paradox when moving observers measure the same speed,
<BR>
which should be impossible.  So the fact that they measure distances and
<BR>
times differently almost goes without saying once we hit this paradox.
<BR>
Einstein just worked out the math.
<BR>
<P>Some people have suggested that Einstein's equations wouldn't work for
<BR>
observers going faster than light.  After all, we have never done any
<BR>
experiments in that case.  Maybe something else happens.
<BR>
<P>This is conceivable, but not that germane.  In the experiment which led
<BR>
to this discussion, no observers were going faster than light.  Rather,
<BR>
we had a phenomenon which gave the impression (apparently illusorily)
<BR>
that a pulse was travelling faster than light.  So all we really need
<BR>
to know is whether Einstein's equations have been tested or would be
<BR>
applicable to physical phenomena which go faster than light.
<BR>
<P>And in fact, the way Einstein's equations work, FTL communication can
<BR>
be analyzed in the same way as any other set of events which occur at
<BR>
close to the same time.  You don't need exotic equipment.  The Mars
<BR>
Global Surveyor camera takes a picture at the same moment that something
<BR>
happens in the lab here on earth.  It's going to take an hour for the
<BR>
picture to get back, but Einstein's equations tell us how to analyze the
<BR>
simultaneous events in terms of a moving observer.  These are exactly
<BR>
the same kinds of equations which would be used for FTL communications.
<BR>
<P>So there is no reason to think that FTL communications would be a new
<BR>
exotic regime where Einstein's equations don't apply.  The basic concept
<BR>
of simultaneous or near-simultaneous events is extremely ordinary and
<BR>
is handled perfectly well by the theory of relativity.
<BR>
<P>Summing up, the theory of relativity is based on a very general
<BR>
philosophical principle, that there is no such thing as ABSOLUTE
<BR>
SPACE where you can reach out and &quot;feel&quot; whether you are moving or not.
<BR>
It is further supported by the observation of the constancy of the speed
<BR>
of light.  And in the years since, it has made many other predictions
<BR>
which have been borne out.  All of this gives us confidence in the
<BR>
accuracy of the theory.  Based on this experience, we can predict that
<BR>
FTL communications would allow for backwards-in-time communications,
<BR>
raising severe problems of causality and logical consistency.  It is
<BR>
therefore very unlikely that FTL communications are possible.
