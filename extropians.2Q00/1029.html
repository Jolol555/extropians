<EM>&gt; &gt; True, though one thing that Libertarians do all too often is run for
</EM><BR>
Federal
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; offices without having candidates for local offices.  A lot of people I
</EM><BR>
talk
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to vote not so much for who they want, but for who they think can win
</EM><BR>
and is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; closer to their views.  (I.e., they already narrow it down to two
</EM><BR>
choices.)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's another thing I and the LP have to fight--the irrational, stupid,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counterproductive, and dangerous idea that there is some value in voting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for someone with a chance of winning.  You'd think people would understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the difference between a vote and a bet: you don't lose your bet or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything else when your voted choice doesn't win the office.  You only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lose when your preference is not expressed--and there's no better way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; utterly fail to express a preference than to vote for a front-runner you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't like and have your vote lost in the landlslide.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with Lee Daniel, but the point is the average person does not.  The
<BR>
problem is it's much harder to get people over the &quot;I don't want to throw
<BR>
away my vote&quot; or &quot;I'd rather have the lesser of two evils now, then wait ten
<BR>
or twenty years for the political landscape to shift&quot; humps than to run in
<BR>
places where one can win.  There are many races, local or otherwise, where
<BR>
competition is less.  If, e.g., only one of the majors is running for a
<BR>
given office, there's a good place to put an LP candidate.  He or she will
<BR>
probably be able to get double digit %ages if not a win in such races.
<BR>
(It's happened before.  Several years ago, an LP candidate in NJ got
<BR>
something like 22% of the vote because one of the majors pulled out of that
<BR>
race.  I forget the office, but it was in the early 1990s.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; One can complain, but it just shows that the current system is not
</EM><BR>
stupid or
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dead.  It has to be outwitted -- not just bemoaned -- if you wish to
</EM><BR>
win.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Adrian Tymes in another post makes some good points on this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you think it's that easy, do it.  Nice of you to just cast aside an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organization with thousands of members and 20 years experience.  The party
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not the incompetent little startup it was 20 years ago; it is now an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experienced, capable, political machine fighting an uphill battle.
</EM><BR>
<P>I actually _DID_ do this with the Libertarian Party, specifically the
<BR>
Somerset-Middlesex Counties (NJ) chapter in the early to mid 1990s.
<BR>
<P>BTW, the LP has been around for 30 years -- not 20.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Building up relationships with journalists is important too.  A lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Libertarians just expect to get covered, but it takes a lot more than
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and an LP candidate is always going to start with this handicap.  One
</EM><BR>
can
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; complain and continue to lose or do something about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now you're just talking out of your ass--you have no idea of the amount
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of work we've been doing.  Harry and the rest of us have worked long and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard, and spent lots of money, building relationships with journalists and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spoon-feeding and supporting the press in every way imaginable.  When we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are not covered, it's because the press is deliberately choosing not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cover us, not because they don't know or haven't been coddled like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spoiled brats they are.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've worked in libertarian political campaigns and causes before.  I know
<BR>
the usual complaints.  I don't disagree that the Media in general is
<BR>
anti-Libertarian and typically pro-Establishment, BUT there are always a few
<BR>
in the Media that are willing to listen and cover.  When I was more active
<BR>
in politics, we -- the people I was active with --tended to get coverage.
<BR>
Of course, we focused on local issues and events so that we could be big
<BR>
fish in a small pond.  Yeah, we didn't always get exactly the coverage we
<BR>
wanted, but we got enough to balance the good with the bad.
<BR>
<P>(Sadly, though, we did not have a lot of people running for local offices.
<BR>
It was fun and exciting to help with the Karlan for Governor campaign, but,
<BR>
in hindsight, it was a waste of resources.  Surely, Sabrin did a lot better,
<BR>
but by then I was already losing interest.  I still think local offices are
<BR>
the way to go.)
<BR>
<P>Aside from this, the point is you have to deal with the realities as they
<BR>
are or find some other method of getting what you want.  Whining does not
<BR>
work.  If it did, every third party would have held the Presidency at least
<BR>
once during the 20th century.
