<BR>
Immortality and Impermanence
<BR>
<P>Wading back into the shallows, let’s examine a certain dilemma of existence,
<BR>
presently overshadowed by the issue of personal death, that will be
<BR>
paramount when practical immortality is achieved. It’s this: in the long
<BR>
run, survival requires change in directions not of your own choosing.
<BR>
Standards escalate with the growth of the inevitable competitors and
<BR>
predators for each niche. In a kind of cosmic Olympic games, the universe
<BR>
molds its occupants toward its own distant and mysterious specifications. An
<BR>
immortal cannot hope to survive unchanged, only to maintain a limited
<BR>
continuity over the short run. Personal death differs from this
<BR>
inevitability only in its relative abruptness. Viewed on a larger scale we
<BR>
are already immortal, as we have been since the dawn of life. Our genes and
<BR>
our culture pass continuously from one generation to the next, subject only
<BR>
to incremental alterations to meet the continuous demand for new world
<BR>
records in the cosmic games.
<BR>
<P>In the very long run the ancestral individual is always doomed, as its
<BR>
heritage is nibbled away to meet short- term demands. It slowly mutates into
<BR>
other forms that could have been reached from a range of starting points–the
<BR>
ultimate in convergent evolution. It’s by this reasoning that I conclude
<BR>
that it makes no ultimate difference whether our machines carry forward our
<BR>
heritage on their own, or in partnership with direct transcriptions of
<BR>
ourselves. Assuming long-term survival either way, the end results should be
<BR>
indistinguishable, shaped by the universe and not by ourselves. Since change
<BR>
is inevitable, I think we should embrace rather than retard it. By so doing
<BR>
we improve our day-to-day survival odds, discover interesting surprises
<BR>
sooner, and are more prepared to face any competition. The cost is faster
<BR>
erosion of our present constitution. All development can be interpreted as
<BR>
incremental death and new birth, but some of the fast-lane options make this
<BR>
especially obvious; for instance, the possibility of dropping parts of one’s
<BR>
memory and personality in favor of another’s. Fully exploited, this process
<BR>
results in transient individuals constituted from a communal pool of
<BR>
personality traits. Sexual populations are effective in part because they
<BR>
create new genetic individuals in very much this way. As with sexual
<BR>
reproduction, the memory pool requires dissolution as well as creation to be
<BR>
effective. So personal death is not banished, but it does lose its poignancy
<BR>
because death by submergence into the memory pool is reversible in the short
<BR>
run.
