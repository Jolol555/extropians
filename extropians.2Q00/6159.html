Quantum Money (3)
<BR>
Was invented, long time ago, by a famous neapolitan comedy writer, Eduardo
<BR>
De Filippo (see: Il Sindaco di Rione Sanità). It is a sort of virtual
<BR>
superposition of debts and credits. In his famous comedy no one gets real
<BR>
money Š
<BR>
scerir
<BR>
<P>'What is 'real money'?' is a better question. Define it. Essentially,
<BR>
anything that acts like money is money, there is no such thing as
<BR>
'unreal money', because money in and of itself is merely a symbol.
<BR>
Anything that is functionally the same as that symbol is, in fact, that
<BR>
symbol.
<BR>
Michael S. Lorrey
<BR>
<P>I agree. Even that famous comedy by Eduardo De Filippo supports Your
<BR>
argument. The Mayor of the Rione Sanità (a quarter, in Naples) acts as a
<BR>
go-between. If you have difficult credits with someone ... the Mayor (a very
<BR>
honourable man) fulfils those obligations ... by means of some *proper*
<BR>
money. But sometimes this *proper* money is ... nothing at all. Wasn't your
<BR>
past behaviour so good ? The honouroble Major counts your bucks in the air
<BR>
and you get nothing in your pocket!
