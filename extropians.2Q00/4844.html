<P><EM>&gt; |But it's quite difficult to know how to predict fascism. A lot

<EM>&gt; |members of Extropians (but, of course, it's not clear how less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |present such signs would be on any other list): a VERY strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |&quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality, strong resentment towards groups
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |thought to have more power than they deserve (environmentalists,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |Jews, feminists, etc., etc., etc. -- the circumcision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |discussions are always good for a laugh: no, no, seriously,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |these ZOG minions -- or would that be &quot;minion&quot;?... -- can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |certainly be annoying; but the point about the danger manifest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |in the reaction is _attitude_, not _content_).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The fascism meme requires that the infected person(s)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   o     feel superior to some other group(s),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   o     feel the(se) other group(s) must be repressed for some reason, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   o     feel obliged to use force against the(se) group(s).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I see anti-fascists fighting fascists, using exactly the same methods.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The danger in fighting fascism is that fascism is contagious:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fascists and anti-fascists become two sides of the same coin.
</EM><BR>
<P>Often, yes. Key is not so much to fight it, as to be aware of
<BR>
the risk of its development within oneself, seems to me.
<BR>
Self-criticism is the safest kind of criticism. (But
<BR>
other-criticism is unavoidable.)
<BR>
<P><P>By the way, the first of your three criteria is present among
<BR>
pretty much anyone who has an opinion, and the second also (to a
<BR>
slightly lesser degree, though; also, depends on what
<BR>
&quot;repressed&quot; means). The question is really about the third, I'd
<BR>
argue (and about what constitutes &quot;force&quot;).
<BR>
<P>And, in turn, the question about the third is for the most part
<BR>
a question about whether the current absence of such a feeling
<BR>
among a particular group sheds more than minimal light on its
<BR>
continued absence. Circumstances change, feelings change.
<BR>
<P>As I said, I certainly ssee the seeds of your third criterion in
<BR>
the anti-, para-, and un-Extropian lists as well as on
<BR>
Extropians.
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
Brian.
