<P><EM>    &gt; What I do predict is that this surveillance will lead, in baby steps, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; what I predict will be one of the ultimate effects of transparency, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; reduction in illegal behavior.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only if the transparency works both ways and the people doing the
<BR>
surveillance are themselves under surveillance, but of course that's
<BR>
impossible. The President would never agree to have a camera in
<BR>
the oval office so all the world could see what he's doing, and besides
<BR>
I can always use encryption for things I don't want you to know about.
<BR>
<P>What about cameras, if I can see what you're typing cryptography does no good.
<BR>
<P>I'll find the camera, splice into the video line, and play back a recording of me
<BR>
reading the Bible, saluting the flag, and generally being a good little boy.
<BR>
Now I can do what I want.
<BR>
<P>But cameras can be very small nowadays, how will you find it?
<BR>
<P>I'll just march down to Big Brother's Ministry Of Truth and ask.
<BR>
<P>They'll see you splice into the line.
<BR>
<P>There are far too many cameras for somebody to be watching all of them all
<BR>
of the time, I'll do it when nobody is watching.
<BR>
<P>How will you know when nobody is watching?
<BR>
<P>I'll ask.
<BR>
<P>What if they make recordings?
<BR>
<P>Now that I have a little privacy I'll take my time, hack into the system and
<BR>
alter the recording. This only has to be done one time by one person because
<BR>
now I'm in a position to help my friends.
<BR>
<P>How will you know how to get around network security?
<BR>
<P>I'll ask.
<BR>
<P>What if there is a secret camera you don't know about?
<BR>
<P>Then I'm in trouble, but Big Brother is in worse trouble. Think of the
<BR>
scandal! Big Brother, the very apostle of transparency has a secret, what
<BR>
other secrets does he have? How can anybody ever trust him again?
