<EM>&gt;     &gt;The fact is that  Windows is a really lousy product in comparison to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;products out there,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'll tell you a product that's really lousy, Be. You can't do anything with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nothing is written for it, it's like a beautiful house with no plumbing of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;furniture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Someday that might change and there would be as much stuff for it as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;windows,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but by then somebody would have written a completely new operating system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and academics would be complaining how inelegant Be is. The most popular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;operating system will never be the newest or the one that uses the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advanced technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>Curious how Be was supposed to be the OS to save Mac.  The entire Mac user 
<BR>
community was convinced of this.  MacWorld even gave away beta versions on 
<BR>
its cover CD.  Suddenly Jobs is brought in with the much-inferior NeXT OS.  
<BR>
Immediately thereafter, Bill Gates suddenly invests a bunch of money - $150 
<BR>
million, if memory serves - in Apple...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;MS has managed to capture its market has been through criminal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; - e.g., it's attempted stealing of Stacker for DOS 6.0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Is that the best you could come up with? Microsoft got into trouble because 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  they violated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Stackers &quot;look and feel&quot;, the only thing dumber is the patent on business 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plans or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Amazons patent on one click shopping. Anyway, I hope you're not saying that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is where it is today because of disk compression, dose anybody even use 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that shit anymore?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
MS, as I recall, had a joint venture with Stacker to produce the compression 
<BR>
system for DOS 6.0.  After working closely with the Stacker engineers for 
<BR>
some time, suddenly MS cancelled the deal and then released 6.0 with &quot;their&quot; 
<BR>
compression software.
<BR>
Stacker sued successfully, claiming they could prove that the code was 
<BR>
directly stolen, and ultimately accepting $120 million settlement from MS.  
<BR>
Meanwhile, the user community was up in arms, as it turned out that Stacker 
<BR>
had apparently not quite trusted MS from the start, and had not given them 
<BR>
the entire solution.  Thus, thousands or perhaps millions of businesses 
<BR>
suddenly found themselves losing entire hard drives as the incomplete MS 
<BR>
compression system started failing without warning.
<BR>
MS had to then release an upgrade - 6.1 or something - with the corrected 
<BR>
verion of the compression system, after costing their users hundreds of 
<BR>
millions of dollars in losses, very likely, based on the reports of the 
<BR>
time.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;MS is a corporation, a legal child of the  state, that sells bigtime 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to state entities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Of course Microsoft sells to the state,  it makes an important product and  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sells to everybody,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but to claim that the reason for their success is unfair favorable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;treatment by government is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nuts. Name me a company that has less to do with the military or relays 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;less on government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contracts than Microsoft.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I'm sure there are thousands of such companies, but in the MS case, the 
<BR>
state involvement seems very clear.
