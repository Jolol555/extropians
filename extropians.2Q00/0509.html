<EM>&gt; &gt; Thanks Damien. I would prefer, however, to see the actual statistics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, rather than what some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gun control group claims they are. From my own experience with gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; control groups here in the US, they are superb liars and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; propagandists,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and while I might be wrong about your groups down there, I don't think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they can be that much different.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Since the ABS hasn't posted any actual stats on crime on its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; website, do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you think you could access their data at your university library?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The ABS has had the stats on crime on its websites for a while, i've posted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them here before.  The only difference between the claims between the NRA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the gun-control lobby is that the NRA is taking 1997 as the first gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control year and the gun-control lobby is taking 1998 as the first gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control year.  1999 isn't up yet.

<P>Thanks, I couldn't find them there, every place I looked on their site
<BR>
wanted to sell you a printed report...
<BR>
<P>According to the data, while murders are down by 28 between 1996 and
<BR>
1998 (~-10%), the number of attempted murders &amp; manslaughters is up by
<BR>
58 in the same period (~+16%) which indicates possibly that not only are
<BR>
more crimes being committed, but the gun ban is merely making the same
<BR>
criminals commit their crimes with weapons that are easier to obtain
<BR>
lesser convictions on, and encouraging more criminals to commit these
<BR>
crimes with lesser weapons on people they know are less likely to be
<BR>
able to defend themselves.
<BR>
<P>Moreover, the assault rate is also up by over 10%, while armed robberies
<BR>
have increased by 80%, and unarmed robberies have increased by 30%,
<BR>
which are rather remarkable increases for a two year period, and reflect
<BR>
increased boldness by criminals who know their victims are less likely
<BR>
to be armed, and by criminals who are themselves more likely to be
<BR>
armed. Blackmail/Extorion is up by over 10%, unlawful entries are up by
<BR>
10%, motor vehicle thefts are up by around 7%, and other thefts are up
<BR>
by around 8%.
<BR>
<P>So, apparently the only area that the gun controllers can point to is
<BR>
murders, while all other forms of homicide are up (which jives with a
<BR>
shift to other weapons than guns), and all forms of property crimes and
<BR>
assualts (with the singular exception of no real change in sexual
<BR>
assault) are also up by large amounts for such a short period.
<BR>
<P>It looks to me like Australia has got a nice little crime wave going on
<BR>
since the new gun laws went into effect.
