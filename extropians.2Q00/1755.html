<P>&lt;&lt; When industries are heavily invested in current technologies to increase

&nbsp;production, and market demand suddenly drops by a large margin, you will
<BR>
&nbsp;wind up with many bankrupt companies (whose market value has evaporated)
<BR>
&nbsp;and many displaced employees. The high enemployment and the loss of
<BR>
&nbsp;capital value both can cause severe economic turmoil if that industry is
<BR>
&nbsp;a large enough sector of the economy.

Michael,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your point is well made.  I don't want to pull a &quot;gotcha&quot; on you but 
<BR>
normally that doesn't happen.  Henry Ford made his first auto around 1905 and 
<BR>
as late as 1945 I saw horses being used for everyday transportation of goods. 
<BR>
&nbsp;By that time they were used infrequently but it took that long to phase them 
<BR>
out.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying to come up with a massive change in a major industry and the 
<BR>
closest I can come is the switch from vinyl records to CDs.  However that 
<BR>
seemed to take five or ten years and it doesn't qualify as a major industry 
<BR>
in my mind.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the switch from cottage industries to large factories in 
<BR>
England?  Does anyone know how long that took?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also doubt very much that the switch to Mollers Aircar would be all 
<BR>
that fast.  The operation of those aircraft would require a license.  If we 
<BR>
put really large numbers in the air our air control systems would have to be 
<BR>
upgraded tremendously.  In addition we would no doubt keep the roads and road 
<BR>
transportation as our primary freight mover.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the disruption of auto plants and auto workers.  The big auto 
<BR>
makers would invest in aircar companies as they have invested in each other.  
<BR>
BTW, are you aware of the percentage of Japanese auto makers that are 
<BR>
partially owned by Detroit companies?  It is substantial.  Finally auto 
<BR>
plants would close, be bought up by aircar companies with a large number of 
<BR>
the same investors.  The auto workers would be rehired to make aircars and in 
<BR>
a few years the UAW or another union would have them organized.
<BR>
