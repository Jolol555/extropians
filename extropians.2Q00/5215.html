<EM>&gt;     &gt; Plutonium is just too hard to get,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I hope you're right but there are thousands of tons of the stuff and 9 pounds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can make a bomb. It's not like money where you can keep track of every cent,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whenever you process or machine Plutonium a little sticks to the machinery and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is unaccounted for. This worries me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Using only 9 lbs requires capabilities of the highest caliber. You don't just
<BR>
learn how in college. Publicly available designs call for much more.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;too hard to  handle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd have to be careful or I might get cancer, but if I'm crazy enough to kill a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; million people I probably wouldn't let a little thing like that stop me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Plutonium dust poisoning kills you in a matter of a few days. Actual physical
<BR>
skin contact with the weapons grade metal will kill you as quickly. Funny thing
<BR>
about arabs, they have this cultural thing against dying in bed at a young age
<BR>
(at least the bedouins do).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;He said that the NMD was so vulnerable that it has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;a number of soft radar sites, so that if any one of these is taken out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;the whole system is useless.  Nowthen, it doesnt take an extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;to figure out that *no* weapon system is designed with multiple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;single-point failure modes and zero redundancy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One half a megaton explosion 90 miles above Washington would create an EMP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that would shut down the entire eastern seaboard power grid and blow out every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; civilian computer and RADAR from Boston to Atlanta. Perhaps the military stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is tougher but I'm skeptical, they've got sensitive electronics connected to huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; antennas and the pulse is so fast, much faster than lightning, that fuses are useless.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even the US doesn't make half megaton weapons any more, and those we did make
<BR>
once were very difficult and expensive. We only made megaton weapons because of
<BR>
missile and reentry vehicle technology constraints in the 50's and 60's, and
<BR>
they don't exist anymore. All of our weapons range from 50k - 250k tons.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;Production is cheap, way cheap in  comparison to that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cheaper than mass producing simple dumb ICBMs? I don't think so.
</EM><BR>
<P>Simple dumb ICBMs are a misnomer. Scuds are tactical missiles, not
<BR>
intercontinental, and they are lucky if they land within a few miles of their
<BR>
targets. Extrapolate that to a longer range system, and you are lucky if
<BR>
Akhmed's ICBM is going to hit the right state. Completely useless.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;Once we design a space based laser system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Space based? I didn't know you were talking about a permanent orbital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; battle station. OK. I'll orbit a much cheaper satellite of my own in a similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orbit but moving in the opposite direction. A modern anti tank gun fires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a round that weighs about 5 pounds and moves at 1 mile a second,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it can destroy a 70 ton M1 tank. The relative speed of our two satellites
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is 11 miles a second, 121 as much kinetic energy per unit of mass,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so a projectile that weighed about half an ounce could nock out a M1.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your space station will certainly not be a tough as a tank so I think I'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just throw a bucket of sand in your path. Even if you miss the grains the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first time every 45 minutes the come around again.
</EM><BR>
<P>My laser battle stations are small nukes with dozens of xray waveguides
<BR>
surrounding a heavy sheilding shell. You can launch literally hundreds of these
<BR>
from the bay of a space shuttle, and they can take sand abrasion as a matter of
<BR>
course.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;Recall that the photons that come out of the business end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;a laser have *already* passed thru a highly reflective surface.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Only one end of a LASER is highly reflective, the other end, the one the beam
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comes out, is about 50% reflective and with many high power LASERS it needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be replaced after every shot.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, mechanical shutters are being used now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;those who design and build missile defense systems are not hurting for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;employment. They could make waaay more money elsewhere, but dont.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't believe that for a minute. I think the reasons for the project are bureaucratic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; momentum and a childish fascination with things that go boom. I'm childish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself and like things that go boom too, but there are limits I will not stoop to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, it's easy for me to say that because I'm not an expert on light weight high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy chemical LASERS, but if I was where else could I find a job? It's either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; star wars or the golden arches, hold the pickles hold the lettuce.
</EM><BR>
<P>hardly. laser technology is a booming industry for health care, for industrial
<BR>
cutting and welding, all sorts of things, plus you've got the launch laser
<BR>
program as well... there are way more job openings now for laser research than
<BR>
just a few years ago.
