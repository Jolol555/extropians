...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wonder how much smell actually influences mate selection and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supports similar types of subconscious communication.

<P>Quite a bit. In a college biopsychology class, I was told of an experiment 
<BR>
where several males wore gauze under their armpits while excercising. The 
<BR>
gauze was put in a paper lunch bag (each male's gauze in a seperate bag), 
<BR>
and several women (not knowing who the men were) were asked to judge, on the 
<BR>
basis of smell of the lunch bag, who they would most like to go on a date 
<BR>
with (presumably it was a forced selection experiment). The results showed 
<BR>
that they had the strongest preference for men who had a larger difference 
<BR>
in immune system to them. I don't quite understand this part, and the proper 
<BR>
word for it is on the tip of my tongue.. but it's when you have certain 
<BR>
factors on your white blood cells which is inherited, and the logic behind 
<BR>
this is that their offspring would have resistance to a wider range of 
<BR>
diseases because of the differences in the immune system of both parents.
<BR>
Another cool experiment - males have some kind of gland, near the genitals, 
<BR>
which secretes some kind of stuff which has a particular chemical in it. 
<BR>
This chemical was isolated, and put into lockets which would release it 
<BR>
throughout the day. So they took these lockets, plus scent-less lockets for 
<BR>
the control group, and had female volunteers wear them for a day, and 
<BR>
measure the amount of social interaction they had with males. The ones 
<BR>
wearing the chemical lockets had quite a bit more interaction, presumably 
<BR>
because they were responding to the pheromonic properties of the locket they 
<BR>
were wearing as if it were being secreted by whichever male they happened to 
<BR>
be sitting by.
<BR>
And I'm sure you've heard of the &quot;dormitory effect&quot;, where women's menstrual 
<BR>
cycles will synchronize if they're roommates. It's believed to be mediated 
<BR>
by pheromones.
