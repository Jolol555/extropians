<EM>&gt; &gt; nutrition.  This is attributed in part to a decreased ability to

<EM>&gt; &gt; smell and taste the food...
</EM><BR>
<P>I've heard it's also attributed to the lack of digestive enzymes and the
<BR>
reduction in stomach acid production.  A recent issue of _Life Extension_
<BR>
discussed this.  See www.lef.org
<BR>
<P>It might also be because some elderly people are depressed or, in some
<BR>
cases, might not know how to care for themselves.  (In the latter cases, I'm
<BR>
thinking of a lot of elderly widowers who don't know how to prepare foods
<BR>
and either wind up eating out a lot or making easy to prepare (&quot;microwave
<BR>
classics&quot;, cold cuts, TV dinners, etc.) meals at home.  I think someone did
<BR>
a study on this a number of years ago.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This has led me to speculate that if one were to defeat the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; olfactory organs, then one's sense of taste would be greatly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diminished which would almost naturally make CR much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easier, resulting in a longer life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At a price.  Any takers?  Has anyone heard of anyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tried such a strategy?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>A capital idea!
<BR>
<P>I think it could be done reversibly and cheaply.  Several methods come to
<BR>
mind.  One is using some sort of face mask.  Another is to put something in
<BR>
the nose to disallow the aromas in.  Another might be to overpower food
<BR>
odors with other odors.  Someone might try that and see what happens.
<BR>
<P>I have heard that eating bland foods generally makes one consume less.
