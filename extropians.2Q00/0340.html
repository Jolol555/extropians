<P>Company Finishes Sequence of One Person's Genes
<BR>
By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Correspondent 
<BR>
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Celera Genomics said on Thursday it had finished the
<BR>
first step of sequencing -- making a kind of map -- the genes of one person
<BR>
and was starting to put the pieces together. 
<BR>
The U.S. company aims to be the first to have a complete sequence of the
<BR>
human genome, which is the collection of all the genes and other genetic
<BR>
material that are the basic blueprint of life. 
<BR>
Celera plans to use the genes of five different people, who will remain
<BR>
anonymous, to make up a final human genome sequence. It will copy this
<BR>
sequence several times over to make sure it is correct. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
It started working on the human genome in September, using a method called
<BR>
whole genome shotgun sequencing. This is a different method from that used
<BR>
by a public alliance of researchers, called the Human Genome Project, which
<BR>
is also working to sequence the human genome. 
<BR>
``Now that we have completed the sequencing of one human being's genome we
<BR>
will turn our computational power to the task of ordering the human
<BR>
genome,'' Craig Venter, the company's president and chief scientific
<BR>
officer, said in a statement. 
<BR>
``This is expected to allow researchers worldwide and our subscribers to
<BR>
utilize our data to make important medical advances.'' 
<BR>
Celera has been accused of failing to keep its promise to make the human
<BR>
genome information widely available. But Celera has said it will provide
<BR>
this information. Venter is set to testify before the U.S. Congress Thursday
<BR>
morning. 
<BR>
The sequence is only a very early first step to understanding the human
<BR>
genome. It does not tell scientists what the genes do -- it just gives the
<BR>
order of the nucleotides, which are the molecules that make up the twisted
<BR>
double helix of DNA. 
<BR>
What Celera has done is take the genes and break them apart into two
<BR>
different lengths. It uses standard genetic technology to read out the
<BR>
nucleotides -- known by the initials A, C, T and G. These four nucleotides
<BR>
repeat over and over again in varying patterns, and these patterns make up
<BR>
the genetic code. 
<BR>
What Celera has now is what has been described as a big pile of jigsaw
<BR>
puzzle pieces. It will now use its powerful computers to read the A, C, T
<BR>
and G code and put together the pieces. 
<BR>
One person's genes are not considered enough to tell scientists about the
<BR>
human genome. Celera plans to use five people, all of whom will remain
<BR>
anonymous. 
<BR>
Mark Adams, vice president for genome programs at Celera, said they were
<BR>
chosen for their diversity. ``They are not five white guys,'' he said in a
<BR>
recent interview. 
<BR>
The Human Genome Project, in contrast, is using a ``mosaic'' of about 10
<BR>
different donors. Most of the sequence will come from one person's genes.
<BR>
He, too, will remain anonymous. 
<BR>
Scientists then hope to compare various people's different genes to one
<BR>
another to find the tiny changes in the code that make one person different
<BR>
from another. 
<BR>
Celera just last month published the genome of the most complex animal yet
<BR>
sequenced, the common fruit fly. Other scientists, who had cast doubts on
<BR>
the company's methods, have praised the work.
