<EM>&gt; I have always enjoyed Lal's hypocricy - sermonising about the

</EM><BR>
<P>They're all hypocrits.  Or they find ways to phrase advances in terms of
<BR>
their longer-term goals (reference Santiago's admiteddly not-too-shabby
<BR>
defense of building child care centers in what are supposed to be
<BR>
military bases).  They all want the same thing in the end (only, each
<BR>
for themselves).  Morgan comes closest to flat-out acknowledging that
<BR>
what they want trumps any ideology.
<BR>
<P>It may be worth noting that SMAC's makers host a Web site with
<BR>
discussion forums for various aspects of the game.  In the sections
<BR>
given to role-playing and posting of alternate faction files around the
<BR>
time of the game's first release, the more popular tended to be less
<BR>
centered on static ideologies than on &quot;we don't know exactly what we
<BR>
want, but we'll adapt to what comes our way, so the only thing that
<BR>
unites our faction is our shared history and government&quot;.  All aspects
<BR>
had their turn as each one supported the needs of the day, and the next
<BR>
day; no meme lasted forever unless it was truly useful for that length
<BR>
of time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I dream about making my own game in the same style, but deliberately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; focusing on transhumanism. After all, it is a bit odd that you still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need farming and mines after you get nanotech, for example.
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably wouldn't be that hard to do, given enough spare time.  I mean,
<BR>
the rules are more or less obvious, and thus easily boil down to
<BR>
algorithms.  There's various libraries available for graphics (one of
<BR>
the easiest libraries is Java's, which also gets you Windows/Mac/Unix
<BR>
without having to port code).  If you can't do the music and/or graphics
<BR>
yourself, you can probably find a friend to do it.  The hardest part
<BR>
would be the overall game design: how to fit in the elements you want,
<BR>
while still leaving a good *game* from the viewpoint of a non-extropian.
<BR>
<P>(I say that since I'm doing kinda the same - only as a Zelda-style CRPG
<BR>
rather than a strategy game.  Programming it is not that hard, when I
<BR>
know what I want: define it down to an algorithm, then phrase the
<BR>
algorithm in code.  I'm slowly learning how to do my own sprites and
<BR>
backgrounds, and I found a music generator that, while not good
<BR>
quality, does fit into the game's theme.  But it is the plot that gives
<BR>
me trouble...)
