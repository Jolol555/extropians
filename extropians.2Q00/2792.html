<EM>&gt; I am deeply sorry to pass on the terrible news that Sasha Chislenko, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long-time extropian and friend of many here, died on Monday.

<P>I'm late answering this. I didn't know Sasha. I think I may have briefly
<BR>
looked at his website once. I noticed his presence on the list and read
<BR>
his posts, but I don't think I ever exchanged words with him, one way or 
<BR>
the other.
<BR>
<P>I now have this weird feeling that's the intellectual equivalent of the
<BR>
sensation of wrongness you get, when you run your tongue around the
<BR>
inside of your mouth and feel a gap in your teeth that shouldn't be there.
<BR>
<P>And  I regret not having gotten to know him.
