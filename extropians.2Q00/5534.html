<EM>&gt; I had thought such sentiments only existed in the venue of KKK, Chistian

<EM>&gt; Identity, and other radical protestant groups. While no longer a practicing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Catholic, my extropic ideas about the universe and our place in it originated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long before I heard of ExI, with ideas like Tielhard des Chardins' theories of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the emmanetization of the eschaton (the original Omega Point theory). Tielhard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was a catholic priest, BTW, and much extropic thought fits well with much

<EM>&gt; catholic philosophy.

<P>Michael,
<BR>
<P>I agree totally.  Hmm...maybe I should go back and read Dan's comments on
<BR>
Mother Theresa...I seem to remember that they didn't contradict in any
<BR>
significant way the comments you've made here.  As for the Catholic
<BR>
bashing...well, there's plenty of discrimination and hate to go around on
<BR>
both sides of that issue.  I've met atheists who are incredibly
<BR>
close-minded to anything that a Christian has to say merely because they
<BR>
believe in God.  I've also met Catholics who won't consider anything
<BR>
outside of their limited sphere of doctrine.  However, in my experience,
<BR>
both of these are the exception.  Most atheists and christians I know are
<BR>
reasonable people, and most atheist and christian (even catholic) beliefs
<BR>
and teachings are worth listening to, without out of hand rejecting it
<BR>
merely because it belongs to the other side.
<BR>
<P>Wow.  *That* was preachy :)
<BR>
<P>Pax,
<BR>
Eileen
