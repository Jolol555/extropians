<P><EM>&gt; Harvey, I completely understand where you are coming from.  I view a copy as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a COPY, and even if ABSOLUTELY like me, it is not &quot;ME.&quot;  It is instead a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; totally identical twin.  This is for me so simple to understand.  It will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start off totally like me, but in time diverge and develop it's own 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; identity, to at least an extent.
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems to be that to call something a perfect &quot;copy&quot; (or even nearly
<BR>
perfect, for that matter) implies that it experiences a continuity with
<BR>
the pre-split self, just like the post-split &quot;original&quot; does.  You(1) and
<BR>
you(2) could be aware that you've undergone a copying, but lack external
<BR>
evidence as to which of you is the &quot;copy&quot; or the &quot;original&quot; (an easily
<BR>
constructed scenario).
<BR>
<P>There seem to be three main theories about duplication, with regard to
<BR>
the subjective awareness of continuity (SAC):
<BR>
<P>1) It is metaphysically impossible to duplicate a SAC.  (The best you
<BR>
might be able to do is a Turing machine.)
<BR>
<P>2) Upon duplication, the existing SAC would govern all of the duplicates,
<BR>
like a &quot;collective ego&quot;.
<BR>
<P>3) Upon duplication, each of the duplicates would consider itself the
<BR>
continuation, and the others as duplicates. (i.e. split-SAC)
<BR>
<P>2 reduces to either 1 or 3.  If the collective SAC continues to govern all
<BR>
of the duplicates, even as they acquire different experiences and change
<BR>
cognitively, physically, etc., then there is never really a duplication,
<BR>
just an extention of the psychical/bodily toolbox of a single SAC.  If the
<BR>
collective SAC (as some have suggested) degenerates as the units begin to
<BR>
change, then it must turn into either a set of SACs (3) or the single SAC
<BR>
plus some SAC-less machines (maybe Turing machines). (1)
<BR>
<P>1 is interesting.  Is there any way to hold it without accepting
<BR>
metaphysical dualism?  Also, if you were to create a duplicate of a
<BR>
person, minus their SAC, is it even possible that it could be a perfect
<BR>
Turing machine?  That is, are certain observable traits (perhaps
<BR>
creativity, artistry, certain forms of self-preservation) actually effects
<BR>
of the presence of a SAC?
<BR>
<P>3 is also interesting.  From the perspective of the pre-split SAC, would
<BR>
it be accurate to assign a 1/n probability of continuing into each of the
<BR>
n post-split SACs?
