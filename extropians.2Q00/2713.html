<EM>&gt; &gt; That has been my argument. If Mr. Zero wants to spew his identity all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; over the public arena, let him. If he doesn't, which is apparently how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; he feels about his personal identity, then he has absolutely no right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; argue that I should meet a standard that he has no intention of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; conforming to, and by his admitted example of his instructions to his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; kids, has no intention of encouraging any other member of his family to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As it stands, I already meet his standard far better than he does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike, please.  Who are you to decide if Zero has a &quot;right&quot; to argue anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he wants?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, Zero has never advocated anybody reveal their address over the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internet.  I spuriously suggested that he should give me all of his personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; details.  His response was a retort that I should go first.  He never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seriously asked anybody to do this, and never promised that he would do so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if anybody/everybody else did also.
</EM><BR>
<P>How is being a 'ubiquitous surveillance fanatic' (which Mr Zero has
<BR>
admitted to being) not equal to advocating that everyone reveal their
<BR>
address, as well as all sorts of other personal, private information,
<BR>
over the internet? He claims that he supports ubiquitous surveillance
<BR>
for the most altruistic of reasons, yet the simple test of his own
<BR>
personal commitment to lead by example fails, and exposes that he is not
<BR>
being altruistic or honest.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are attacking Zero based on his answers to my question.  This makes me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel partially responsible for your attack against him.  I would like you to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stop attacking Zero, and realize that he never promised or advocated giving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out personal information on the Internet.  That was a comment intended for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me, and it doesn't mean what you think it does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, Harvey, I asked him first, so don't feel responsible on my
<BR>
account. I will stop attacking him, though, because it seems that there
<BR>
are plenty of other people on the list who have come to the conclusion
<BR>
that he or his idea is full of it, too, that surveillance is not what he
<BR>
would like it to be.
