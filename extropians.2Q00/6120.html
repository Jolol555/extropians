<EM>&gt; &gt; I imagine, from the way you have conducted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; yourself here, that you are the sort of person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; who gives thanks every day for the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; duels are no longer legal means of settling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; personal disputes of honor. If you conduct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; yourself in your real interpersonal relations as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you have here, I would imagine that you would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not last long in such an environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What a despicable thing to say. I conduct myself the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everywhere, and I've never been involved in any physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violence in my life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have received death threats, however, which is part of why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your comments are so chilling to me. You are saying, in effect,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;this is someone whose behavior would be seen by many as worthy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of death (or sufficient injury to no longer be 'lasting').&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How insensitive, unproductive, and one-sided. If what you say is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; true, the people with such views are the ones in error.
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh, no. Its people like you who think that you can pop off anything at
<BR>
all, so long as you act like you are saying it in a good natured way, or
<BR>
say 'cheerio, pip pip' at the end makes everything nice nice happy
<BR>
happy. Your repeatedly skewed ideas about the world, like
<BR>
anti-circumcision being the same as anti-semitism, which have not
<BR>
logical basis in fact, as well as your assumption that the term 'a man's
<BR>
wife' asserts some sort of property claim, indicates to me that you are
<BR>
not playing with a full deck, or else you get some visceral, unadmitted
<BR>
pleasure from insulting people and acting innocent about it...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Worse still, is this (note that this sentence followed the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; previous, in the same paragraph):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The idea that you think you can so offhandedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; make personal aspersions about a mans wife
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and expect no adverse repercussions just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; boggles the mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; First, I did not expect no repercussions. Second, it was not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offhanded. Finally, the property orientation towards Natasha is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not one I had in the forefront of my mind. She's an independent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human being who treated me badly, I did the same back. What's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the big deal?
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no property orientation involved, but this comment of yours is
<BR>
exactly the sort of blind assumption you keep making in all of your
<BR>
inane and insulting posts. You are operating off of some sort of
<BR>
politically correct memeset that seems to look at anything anybody says
<BR>
from a 90 degree angle from the rest of the rational universe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If you wish to retain any place here, I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; emphatically suggest you make a sincere and full
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; apology to both Max and Natasha and let the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; discussion drop at that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm the one owed apologies, by an increasing number of people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (now you).
</EM><BR>
<P>No, Brian, I owe you nothing.
