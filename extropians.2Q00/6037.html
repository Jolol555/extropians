<BR>
<P>&nbsp;By LIDIA WASOWICZ, UPI Science Writer  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAN FRANCISCO, June 23 (UPI) -- Inspired by the brain's inner 
<BR>
workings, researchers have built an electronic circuit with a 
<BR>
biological twist. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 
<BR>
Cambridge, Mass., Bell Laboratories of Lucent Technologies in Murray 
<BR>
Hill, N.J., and the Institute of Neuroinformatics in Zurich, 
<BR>
Switzerland, report in the British journal Nature their advance in 
<BR>
blending neurobiology and computer design. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MIT's Richard Hahnloser of the Department of Brain and  
<BR>
Cognitive Sciences and Rahul Sarpeshkar, assistant professor of 
<BR>
electrical engineering and computer science, and H. Sebastian Seung, 
<BR>
assistant professor of computational neuroscience, who are also Bell 
<BR>
Labs consultants, and Rodney Douglas and the late Misha Mahowald of the 
<BR>
Swiss center devised an electronic circuit that mimics the biological 
<BR>
circuitry of the cerebral cortex, the brain's center of intelligence. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team developed a mathematical theory of how analog 
<BR>
amplification and digital selection can co-exist in the same circuit, 
<BR>
a combination once thought unlikely. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Apparently the brain, and computers wishing to emulate it, may 
<BR>
have it both ways,&quot; the study authors said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work &quot;demonstrates that we know enough today to begin building 
<BR>
integrated circuits that compute like biology,&quot; Chris Diorio of the 
<BR>
University of Washington in Seattle and Rajesh Rao of the Salk 
<BR>
Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., said in an 
<BR>
accompanying News and Views article. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feat in the emerging field of neuromorphic engineering -- 
<BR>
creating devices that have similar neural systems -- could lead to 
<BR>
machines that can recognize objects by sight and perform other 
<BR>
sophisticated perceptual tasks, scientists said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Like electronic circuits, the neural circuits of the cortex 
<BR>
contain many feedback loops,&quot; Seung said. &quot;But neuroscientists have 
<BR>
found cortical feedback seems to operate in a way unfamiliar to 
<BR>
today's electronic designers. We set out to mimic this novel mode of 
<BR>
operation in an unconventional electronic circuit.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers have a multi-dimensional vision of potential 
<BR>
applications -- though none so bold as the view of the future espoused 
<BR>
by techno-maverick Ray Kurtzweil, who in his latest book, &quot;The Age of
<BR>
the Spiritual Machine: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence,&quot; 
<BR>
asserts the machines of tomorrow will be smarter than the people. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The main use of devices such as ours is for autonomous agents, 
<BR>
such as robots,&quot; Hahnloser told United Press International. &quot;Like 
<BR>
humans, they need circuits for specific purposes such as obstacle 
<BR>
avoidance. The fact that the circuits we built have a very low power 
<BR>
consumption compared to purely digital circuits enhances the potential 
<BR>
autonomy of these agents by orders of magnitude.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silicon technology that has been driving the computer 
<BR>
revolution continues to improve at rates predicted by the so-called 
<BR>
Moore's law, which forecasts a doubling in computer capacity every 18 
<BR>
months, the researchers said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But there are many scientists working on novel technology such as 
<BR>
quantum computers, DNA computers and other substrates for computation. 
<BR>
Which one will make it I don't know,&quot; Hahnloser said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The fact that we have expressed our current understanding of 
<BR>
recurrent cortical circuits in terms of transistors and silicon might 
<BR>
turn out to be important. Transistors have such a long history of 
<BR>
success, I think they will survive in one form or another. Whether it 
<BR>
will be semiconductors or not remains to be seen.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spate of recent breakthroughs has imbued scientists with a sense 
<BR>
of excitement about witnessing what they see as the start of an era in 
<BR>
digital electronics -- one marked by circuits only a few atoms across 
<BR>
but with unfathomable speed and memory or machines no larger than a 
<BR>
blood cell yet fully programmable and perhaps even able to duplicate 
<BR>
themselves. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groups at Hewlett-Packard, the University of California, Los 
<BR>
Angeles, and elsewhere working on this ultramicroscopic scale, called 
<BR>
molecular electronics, have already created rudimentary electronic 
<BR>
&quot;logic gates&quot; and other basic components of computing with the 
<BR>
thickness of a single molecule. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate aim is to create chemical reactions that assemble 
<BR>
gargantuan numbers of circuits at a cost as minute as their molecular 
<BR>
scale. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other physicists investigating the brain's feats have developed a 
<BR>
program that can recognize patterns, a so-called learning algorithm 
<BR>
that may lead to significant improvements in a host of fields, from Web 
<BR>
searches to voice recognition and other computer applications to 
<BR>
medical imaging. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brain-inspired circuit technology could have a vast impact, 
<BR>
investigators said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A PC is a universal machine, capable of doing about anything you 
<BR>
program it to -- if you have time enough to wait for the answer,&quot; 
<BR>
Hahnloser said, noting the new advance could make a pronounced 
<BR>
difference in how -- and how fast -- such computations are performed. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you are about to hit an obstacle, you'd rather recognize it 
<BR>
quickly and trigger an avoidance behavior early,&quot; he said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain's basic computing element, the neuron, is on the slow 
<BR>
side and incapable of performing such difficult computations as 
<BR>
recognizing a familiar face from different angles and under different 
<BR>
lighting conditions, scientists said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to their dense interconnection, however, neurons can share, 
<BR>
exchange and process information. &quot;Therefore, as a whole, they can 
<BR>
achieve incredible speed, reliability, fault tolerance and capability 
<BR>
of adaptation and learning,&quot; Hahnloser said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Digital computers such as the PC are different. The memory and the 
<BR>
processor elements are physically separate from each other. Each basic 
<BR>
computation is executed very rapidly, but the computation as a whole is 
<BR>
executed serially, in a step-by-step manner.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And digital computers have no tolerance for error -- delete a 
<BR>
single wire, and the computer may stop functioning altogether. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In this sense our circuit is more like the brain,&quot; Hahnloser told 
<BR>
UPI. &quot;The computation is done in parallel, thanks to the dense 
<BR>
interconnectivity between the many artificial neurons.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they have not yet demonstrated it, theoretically, the circuit 
<BR>
should still perform fully even with a severed wire, the researchers 
<BR>
said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our work is situated at the direct interface between neuroscience 
<BR>
and engineering,&quot; Douglas said. &quot;We use insights from neuroscience to 
<BR>
improve our understanding and creativity in engineering and vice 
<BR>
versa.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach in taking inspiration from biology to build circuits 
<BR>
is rooted in the pioneering work of Carver Mead, a professor at the 
<BR>
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. All of the 
<BR>
previous work focused on the periphery, rather than on the center, of 
<BR>
the nervous system. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decade ago, for example, Mahowald built a silicon retina, 
<BR>
implementing the first stages of the visual system. Sarpeshkar later 
<BR>
constructed a silicon cochlea, representing the first stages of the 
<BR>
auditory system. And Douglas and Mahowald devised an electronic 
<BR>
equivalent of a real neuron, emulating its many ionic currents. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our goal is aimed at implementing a higher brain function -- not 
<BR>
directly relating to the periphery of the brain circuits -- which is 
<BR>
the computations that are performed in the recurrent circuits of the 
<BR>
neocortex,&quot; Hahnloser said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new circuit is composed of man-made neurons that communicate 
<BR>
with each other via artificial connections called synapses, all of the 
<BR>
elements being made from transistors fabricated on a silicon integrated 
<BR>
circuit. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human brain is a vast and intricate network, comprised of 
<BR>
billions of neurons, each of which might be connected to 10,000 or so 
<BR>
others, scientists said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Biologists like to focus on simple linear pathways through this 
<BR>
network, ignoring the tangled web of feedback loops, which seem too 
<BR>
complex to even contemplate,&quot; Seung said. &quot;But it seems unlikely that 
<BR>
we could ever understand intelligence or consciousness without 
<BR>
understanding the role of feedback in the neural networks of the 
<BR>
brain.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists have tended to draw analogies between electronic and 
<BR>
neural circuits, but recent studies suggest the brain in fact does not 
<BR>
rely on feedback in the same way as do conventional electronics, which 
<BR>
are distinctly analog or digital. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Analog is the value of a perception, such as the intensity, the 
<BR>
contrast or the color,&quot; Hahnloser told UPI. &quot;Digital is the constraints 
<BR>
by which we perceive. We can't look at a face without recognizing it as 
<BR>
such.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, perception combines digital and analog aspects, the study 
<BR>
authors pointed out. When a human sees an approaching car, he also 
<BR>
receives a continuous stream of information about its color, changing 
<BR>
size in relation to its distance, spatial relations to other objects 
<BR>
and the like. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Philosophers and psychologists have long been struck by the 
<BR>
duality between analog and digital in perception,&quot; Seung said. &quot;They 
<BR>
have further speculated about whether the computational operations 
<BR>
underlying perception in the brain are analog or digital.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their research, the authors concluded, indicates the two sides are 
<BR>
not mutually exclusive; rather they appear to coexist in the brain's 
<BR>
neural circuitry. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation 
<BR>
SPP	Program, Lucent Technologies and MIT.
