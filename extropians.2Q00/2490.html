<EM>&gt;&gt; The problem is the definition of &quot;crime&quot;. When any action that has no harm 
</EM><BR>
to another person is labeled a &quot;crime&quot;, then surveillance becomes 
<BR>
tyrannical. We can look forward (for example) to smokers being fined by 
<BR>
mail, and as was stated earlier, a final breakdown of the &quot;innocent until 
<BR>
proven guilty&quot; principle.
<BR>
<P>What I would fear is the fickleness of those in power.  The misuse of 
<BR>
personal preference, personal agenda.  This is a danger now (and always) but 
<BR>
with a transparant society it would be hideously increased.

<EM>&gt;&gt; IMO the Open Society movement is in a phase similar to what Communism went
</EM><BR>
through before the Russian revolution. The idea has a certain superficial
<BR>
appeal, and the fact that it has never been tested allows proponents to get
<BR>
away with glossing over its problems in casual conversation.
<BR>
<P>Yes, it sounds so clean and innocent and wholesome - nothing to fear, nothing 
<BR>
to hide.  I wonder about certain personality types: voyeur types, the 
<BR>
show-offs, the gossip/meddling types, the &quot;nosey parkers&quot;, the &quot;puritan&quot; 
<BR>
types here in the US.  I do not understand those who are on the web now with 
<BR>
their webcams filming them 24x7.  To me that would be a nightmare, a horror, 
<BR>
something that might occur in a madhouse... yet they enjoy it...

<EM>&gt;&gt; There is no question that a completely transparent society would be near 
</EM><BR>
impossible to implement *now*.  However, all the obstacles you mention are 
<BR>
dependent upon present-day public attitudes and present-day technology.  
<BR>
Both of these are rapidly changing, even exponentially so.  
<BR>
<P>How about private attitudes or personality types?  I've lived in a sort of 
<BR>
communal situation.  There was no privacy, no respect for personal space.  It 
<BR>
was one of the worst times of my life.  There *was* someone watching over my 
<BR>
shoulder all the time, listening on phone calls, reading mail, going through 
<BR>
personal belongings.  This is what they do to people in prison!  And we want 
<BR>
to implement it everywhere?

<EM>&gt;&gt; I agree that transparent society is a threat,
</EM><BR>
but that it has benefits as well.  As society becomes more transparent
<BR>
we must compensate by voting more libertarian governments.
<BR>
<P>Yes, the laws must become *very* simple, *very* few, easy to follow, hard to 
<BR>
break.  The gvt must become *extremely* small and ... weak.  These are good 
<BR>
goals, even without transparency.

<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Well, let me put it like this: if there is no clear line between legal and 
</EM><BR>
illegal behavior, then there is effectively no such thing as illegal 
<BR>
behavior.  Or at best, it would lead to what you like to call &quot;capricious 
<BR>
enforcement&quot;.
<BR>
<P>That is precisely what I experienced in my situation of being under 
<BR>
surveillance.  It was &quot;governed&quot; by personal preference on the part of the 
<BR>
... governing body (in that situation).

<EM>&gt;&gt; I, like most law-abiding citizens, have absolutely nothing to fear from a 
</EM><BR>
transparent society.  If your deeds are good, you have no interest in 
<BR>
keeping them secret.  If you are willing to fight tooth and nail to keep 
<BR>
your deeds hidden..., well do the math.
<BR>
<P>Indeed, *you* may have nothing to hide, but does that mean you wish (or are 
<BR>
comfortable with) your, what, love life, most intimate moments, most private 
<BR>
times, recorded to be (possibly) voyeured by strangers, neighbors, or 
<BR>
enemies?  Or are you not a private person?  Would you like to be an actor 
<BR>
24x7?  What about those of us who choose to live alone because we prefer 
<BR>
solitude.  No, we are not doing things bad, wrong, illegal, dangerous... we 
<BR>
simply might like quiet and space.  Of course, maybe that *is* bad, wrong  - 
<BR>
not to wish to be part of the herd.  :?

<EM>&gt;&gt; &quot;Michael&quot; isn't good enough.  I want your full name, address, telephone
</EM><BR>
number, social security number, credit card numbers, a copy of your tax
<BR>
return, a close-up picture of your car keys and house keys, your unpublished
<BR>
papers, videos of you when you were drunk, a measurement of your penis size,
<BR>
and naked pictures of everybody you have had sex with.
<BR>
<P>If you have not done anything illegal, perhaps you've done things you were 
<BR>
not proud of, that you'd just as soon have forgotten.  But no, they're going 
<BR>
to be permanently recorded and available to all.  Rather the way the 
<BR>
political hopefuls' lives are now... spread before the masses - given spin in 
<BR>
any chosen direction, for whatever purpose.

<EM>&gt;&gt; As those who have been through this thread before already know, the

transparency I'm in favor of is completely *mutual*.  So, show me yours and

I'll show you mine.
<BR>
<P>I *don't* want a transparent society.  I wish to be private.  Would there be 
<BR>
force attached to this mutual transparency?

<EM>&gt;&gt; Commies felt the same way. They felt, and beleived with their whole

hearts, that the destiny of humankind was in the subservience of the
<BR>
individual to the state, the elimination of the right to property, that
<BR>
centrally planned governments and economies were the only way to
<BR>
properly run the world. 
<BR>
<P>... it would remove all the problems of evil and wrongdoing for ever and

ever.... as in, too good to be true.

<EM>&gt;&gt; Ubiquitous surveilance has its appeal. It is certainly an interesting
</EM><BR>
approach to the problem of &quot;Big Brother&quot;; Big Brother may be watching, but
<BR>
so is everyone else, and Big Brother is as watched as anyone else.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; However, it does not take account of the (necessary in my opinion) split
</EM><BR>
between the private and public spheres. We all live in cultures where the
<BR>
formal, public culture is different from private, informal culture; we act,
<BR>
feel, and live differently in public than we do in private. This is a
<BR>
psychological effect which has nothing to do with criminal behaviour in
<BR>
private; people just like privacy, for a whole slew of reasons.
<BR>
<P>[snip]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Anyway, this whole attempt to disolve the private realm is interesting. For
</EM><BR>
instance, imagine if a potential employer could examine your entire life in
<BR>
minute detail (presumably with the help of some very smart information
<BR>
filtering/collation systems), to decide whether to employ you or not.
<BR>
Eliezer has complained in the past of the fact that there are still very
<BR>
public searchable databases of his participation in various internet forums
<BR>
available now, from when he was 14, and held opinions which he does not hold
<BR>
now. Imagine that problem multiplied out to the level where every single
<BR>
instant of your life was available to all.
<BR>
<P>Yes, and although a pullet cannot outfly her tailfeathers, it would be nice 
<BR>
to be able to move beyond one's past.
<BR>
<P>No, I do not know of any terrible thing I have done in my youth that I am 
<BR>
trying to hide.  I found early on that honesty was the best policy, for 
<BR>
surely if I tried to hide something questionable, it would surface at the 
<BR>
most inconvenient time.  But it is *my* decision, not something forced upon 
<BR>
me.
