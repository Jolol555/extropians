<EM>&gt; Similar claims are made in the books by Dr. Neal Barnard...'Food for Life'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and 'Eat Right, Live Longer'.  Barnard advocates a vegan diet.  In 'Food
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for Life' he is scientifically explicit about why a vegan diet prevents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cancer, heart disease, arthritis, etc. and includes references.  'Eat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Right, Live Longer' is similar.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I'm not sure a vegan diet is suitable for many people, and quite frankly,
<BR>
virtually everyone I know who is a vegan has their own different set of
<BR>
medical issues.  My own personal observations and experiences lead me to
<BR>
believe that it would actually be less healthy for me.
<BR>
<P>My personal diet has been largely vegetarian (by accident, not design) for
<BR>
many years now, eating rice, potatoes, beans, and lots of vegetables.  I
<BR>
rarely eat egg product (I don't like it), but I do eat a fair quantity of
<BR>
dairy (milk and cottage cheese), and consume modest quantities of poultry
<BR>
and fish on occasion.
<BR>
<P>I am by nature a physically active individual.  When I am in &quot;gym mode&quot;
<BR>
(i.e. I am lifting weights 3-4 times a week in addition to my usual
<BR>
aerobic regimen),  I have noticed that my consumption of meat and dairy
<BR>
products increases dramatically.  Not only that, but I've noticed that my
<BR>
body recovers faster when I increase my consumption of animal products. 
<BR>
While a purely vegan diet works well enough for aerobic activities, in my
<BR>
experience it really lags when I am doing heavy weight lifting no matter
<BR>
how much plant protein I get.  While I have no particular scientific
<BR>
evidence, my own experience suggests that there is more to meat and dairy
<BR>
products than amino acids/proteins and that these additional components are
<BR>
fairly important for individuals who do heavy physical exercise on a
<BR>
regular basis.  I do know that there are important enzymes in dairy
<BR>
products that improve the absorption and utilization of some important
<BR>
nutrients, such as calcium.
