<EM>&gt; &gt; Willing or not, if the alternative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  is starvation the slackers will go out and work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This really naive. Again, 'things will sort themselves out&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's not the only alternative to starvation is it? Crime pays way better.
</EM><BR>
<P>Crime only pays if you set things up so that it is easy to get away with
<BR>
being a criminal. Making a life of crime less attractive than getting a job
<BR>
is not hard at all. All you have to do is:
<BR>
<P>1) Don't try to legislate every aspect of human life. If the police aren't
<BR>
swamped trying to enforce thousands of drug laws, vice laws, public-conduct
<BR>
laws, and god only knows what else, that leaves a lot of resources to chase
<BR>
the relatively small population of violent criminals.
<BR>
<P>2) Make the punishment for &quot;stealing-a-living&quot; crimes like burglary
<BR>
significantly less pleasant than working a menial job. Personally I favor
<BR>
replacing our current prison sentences with much shorter terms served in
<BR>
strict solitary confinement without amenities (about 1 month of solitary per
<BR>
year of current sentencing). Not only is this unpleasant enough to deter
<BR>
people who are actually making a calculated decision, but it also saves lots
<BR>
of money and avoids the problem of mixing prisoners (who then abuse each
<BR>
other, trade criminal skills, and generally encourage each other to go on
<BR>
being criminals when they get out).
<BR>
<P>If you follow these principles, it should be feasible to create a situation
<BR>
in which petty criminals can expect to be caught and punished (in a manner
<BR>
they really, really don't like) on a regular basis. If you can do that,
<BR>
people who are merely lazy will quickly decide they'd rather work at K-Mart
<BR>
than get locked up again. You'll still have a small population of chronic
<BR>
criminals to deal with, but that's another issue entirely.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Don't kid yourself that MacDonald's will suddenly be better stocked with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uneducated unskilled able-bodied humans. (Someone, maybe you, pointed out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that in the US anyone able-bodied can already get a job in janitorial or
</EM><BR>
fast
<BR>
<EM>&gt; food there's an abundance of socially demeaning shitjobs at below poverty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level wages.)
</EM><BR>
<P>It is perfectly possible for a single adult to survive on one of these jobs,
<BR>
even today. If you got rid of all the stupid laws that drive up the price of
<BR>
living (rent controls, crop price supports, etc.) he might even be able to
<BR>
afford a few luxuries (like TV, air conditioning, telephones, movies, eating
<BR>
out, etc.).
<BR>
<P>But the real advantage for the individual of working (rather than being on
<BR>
the dole) is that they aren't stuck in the same place forever. Look at the
<BR>
careers of people who actually do this kind of work long-term, and you'll
<BR>
find that they tend to work their way up to a better standard of living
<BR>
eventually. There is a long ladder of unskilled and semi-skilled jobs,
<BR>
stretching from &lt; minimum wage scut work on up to $25,000/yr salaried junior
<BR>
managers, that a worker can climb based on nothing but perseverance and a
<BR>
little on-the-job training. Almost no one gets stuck at the very bottom for
<BR>
long.
