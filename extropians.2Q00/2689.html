<EM>&gt; &gt; SOURCE:   'The Mail on Sunday' May 7 2000:

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Dr Patrick Moore, the academic and renowned ecologist, was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a founder member of Greenpeace, and later became its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; president.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Firstly, the Mail on Sunday is the Sunday edition of the Daily Mail,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably the most right-wing (in a reactionary sense -- they're not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly libertarian!) newspaper in the UK.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Secondly, Patrick Moore, although a great media personality (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presenter of one of the world's longest-running weekly TV shows, &quot;The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sky at Night&quot;, on BBC TV) is noted for being somewhat on the barking mad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fringe, politically.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I see several major claims in the document:
<BR>
<P>1)  Patrick Moore exists, is a doctor, is a veteran of environmental
<BR>
battles, was a founding member and former president of Greenpeace, and
<BR>
now no longer likes them.
<BR>
<P>2)  Greenpeace, until the mid-eighties, was based on scientific principles.
<BR>
<P>3)  During the mid-eighties, Greenpeace was taken over by a bunch of
<BR>
evil radical extremists with no respect for science.
<BR>
<P>4)  &quot;You could burn every forest in the world, never mind the Amazon,
<BR>
and it would have an insignificant impact on oxygen levels in the atmosphere.&quot;
<BR>
<P>5)  Statistics on deforestation are absurdly inflated by counting areas
<BR>
that are harvested and reforested each year.
<BR>
<P>I'll probably believe (1) and (5) unless someone tells me otherwise. 
<BR>
I'm not sure about (2), since I recall that this war was being fought as
<BR>
far back as _A Step Farther Out_.  (3) strikes me as an interpretation
<BR>
that may have been influenced by human political bias.  (4) is possible,
<BR>
and would be wonderful if it were true, but I'd want to see the numbers.
