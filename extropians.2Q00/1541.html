<P><EM>&gt; Regardless, I have a comment about any anthem that would attach
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself to Extropic Thought/Extropic Art: It would have to be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;automorhing'* tune, one that changed as it was played, in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be in anyway able to express anything Extropic. Or it could be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tune that once sang by an individual, would then pass to the next,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who would add on to it and augment the chords or rhythm or words in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some way -- so that by the passing of one or two days it'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely unrecognizable from what it started at.  That would suit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Muse.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wrote up a semi-serious essay after reading too much algorithmic
<BR>
complexity theory about whether a piece of music that eternally
<BR>
increased in complexity could exist. I suggested using a &quot;composer
<BR>
program&quot; that employed the growing complexity of the natural numbers
<BR>
to produce the music (while individual numbers can have arbitrarily
<BR>
high algorithmic complexity, generating them all in order is trivial -
<BR>
the whole is simpler than the parts - the entire piece of music would
<BR>
be much less complex than many of the phrases inside it). The most
<BR>
interesting part was that to fully appreciate the music, you had to
<BR>
grow with it, otherwise it would just become incomprehensible after a
<BR>
while.
<BR>
<P>Right now I would settle for some theme music software for everyday
<BR>
life... &lt;the extropian-transhumanist synthesizer theme fades over to
<BR>
the neuroscience violins...&gt;
