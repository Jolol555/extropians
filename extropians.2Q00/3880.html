<P>
The National Center for Policy Analysis makes (march, 1999) the argument
<BR>
that guns contribute a significant benefit to society. Given the strong
<BR>
arguments deployed on both sides of the gun debate, an accurate cost &amp;
<BR>
benefit analysis would make a useful objective contribution.
<BR>
<P>The National Center calculated the total annual costs of gun crime by
<BR>
multiplying the number of gun crimes committed each year by the average
<BR>
economic cost of a crime. They used a range of values for each component,
<BR>
since criminologists disagree in assigning dollar costs to a crime
<BR>
(estimates range from $524 to over $20,000, incorporating values for the
<BR>
cost of pain and suffering). Nor is there unanimity on how many gun crimes
<BR>
are committed each year. Official figures from the Justice Department say
<BR>
483,000. Many academics put the figure nearer 900,000. With these values, a
<BR>
range for the annual cost of gun crime can be calculated!
<BR>
<P>Working out the benefits of gun use is even more complicated. Opinions
<BR>
differ widely on how many crimes are prevented each year by the defensive
<BR>
use of guns. Official government figures suggest about 80,000, but most
<BR>
criminologists give much higher estimates, ranging from 764,000 to 3.6
<BR>
million defensive uses a year, which include circumstances where the gun is
<BR>
merely displayed. Multiplying these figures by the average costs of crime
<BR>
produces a range of estimates about how much money is saved by defensive gun
<BR>
use. 
<BR>
<P>The National Center then added another amount based on the number of
<BR>
criminals killed by civilians, taking into account the crimes that criminal
<BR>
would no longer commit (over the next 10 years). Based on these assumptions,
<BR>
the National Center calculated the net annual benefit to society from
<BR>
defensive gun use to be somewhere between 90 million and 39 billion dollars.
<BR>
<P>But if an analysis takes into account some form of long-term benefit, it
<BR>
really also has to take into account long-term costs. The figures ideally
<BR>
would have to include the costs of all the gun crimes committed over the
<BR>
next ten years and the benefits both from the crimes directly prevented by
<BR>
defensive gun use and from all the costs avoided by the killing of
<BR>
criminals. 
<BR>
<P>STATS (april, 1999) took the National Center figures, re-worked them to
<BR>
include full long-term values and applied tests to see how sensitive the
<BR>
data were to certain factors. Conclusions:
<BR>
*    If 2.5 million crimes are prevented each year by defensive gun use,
<BR>
there is a clear and substantial (over $1 billion) net benefit to society
<BR>
from the use of guns.
<BR>
*    If civilians kill 3,000 criminals a year, there is a clear net benefit
<BR>
to society. 
<BR>
*    If the Justice Department figure of 483,000 crimes per year committed
<BR>
with guns is correct, there is a clear net benefit to society.
<BR>
*    However, if you accept the Justice Department figures for crimes
<BR>
prevented and criminals killed, there is a clear and substantial net cost to
<BR>
society. 
<BR>
*    If a median figure for crimes prevented each year (764,000) is used,
<BR>
then there is a clear net cost to society (from $33 million to over $1
<BR>
billion) unless over 2000 criminals are killed each year.
<BR>
<P>The differing conclusions show how unsettled the debate still is.
