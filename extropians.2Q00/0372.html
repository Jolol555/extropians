<EM>&gt; I appreciate the argument that monopolies are unstable - maybe that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so. It's a punctuated equilibrium model - a stable looking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; configuration can spontaneously shatter and something totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unexpected and new can replace it. On the other hand, maybe a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a kind of local maximum - a bottom up economic optimization system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gets stuck and it needs to be perterbed from outside before it can get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going again. What does seem clear though is that, presently, there's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem.  Whether government intervention is necessary or beneficial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a separate question. Maybe, left alone, the market will change and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the situation will resolve itself - or maybe we can save 20 years of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stagnation by stepping in and doing something about it now.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is abundant evidence that it is extremely difficult for a real
<BR>
monopoly to exist at all, and that large market share does not imply an
<BR>
ability to gouge customers.  All of the existing &quot;monopolies&quot; familiar to
<BR>
modern Americans were created by government fiat, usually because an
<BR>
industry wanted special protections from competition.  The historical
<BR>
examples cited by anti-trust proponents are generally inaccurate and
<BR>
discredited.  All in all, there is no good reason to believe that monopolies
<BR>
would be a major problem if anti-trust laws were abolished.
<BR>
<P>That is important, because there is abundant effort that the existence of
<BR>
anti-trust laws imposes major costs on consumers and significantly retards
<BR>
innovation.  The actual effect of such laws is to reduce competition, punish
<BR>
success, and encourage the formation of inefficient government-mandated
<BR>
monopolies that waste vast sums of the consumers' money.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is an over simplification. If Microsoft gains a competitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantage from control of the Windows platform, rather than because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they're offering a better product, then superior products will fail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for reason irrelevant to their quality. I would like to see an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment where products succeed on their own merits, not because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their maker controls the distribution channel or a proprietary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standard.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no plausible mechanism by which Microsoft could exert such an
<BR>
alleged advantage.  The fact that they own the OS does not automatically
<BR>
enable them to build superior programs, and it certainly doesn't let them
<BR>
charge more or work more efficiently.
<BR>
<P>But don't take my word for it.  Look at the history of the market.
<BR>
Microsoft has had lots of products flop, even after they became the dominant
<BR>
OS vendor.  Their typical pattern is to misjudge a market, release a lousy
<BR>
product, and get hammered for a couple of version numbers while they figure
<BR>
out what the customers want.  Then they come out with a product that meets
<BR>
more customer needs than any of their competitors, usually at a lower price,
<BR>
and their market share shoots up to 80-90%.  you can easily verify this by
<BR>
looking at product reviews before and during the shift in market share.
<BR>
<P>Now, last I heard, that is exactly what companies are supposed to do.  so
<BR>
what is the problem?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For instance, I'd like to see a public operating system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specification - something like Posix - and a law prohibiting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government agencies from purchasing operating systems that do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conform to that standard or buying application software which doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run on some minimalist public reference implementation.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, you want the government to decide what an OS should do and how it should
<BR>
be implemented, and then pressure application vendors to only write
<BR>
applications for the official government OS? Who on Earth could possibly
<BR>
benefit from that?
<BR>
<P>If you could actually do it, you would stifle innovation to an extent no
<BR>
monopolist could ever dream of. The government would select OS features on
<BR>
the basis of political influence, and it would take forever to get anything
<BR>
new added to the standard.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Vendors could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than compete and differentiate themselves on the basis of efficiency,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robustness, etc, of their particular version.
</EM><BR>
<P>What's wrong with letting vendors competing on the basis of whatever
<BR>
combination of speed, efficiency, reliability and features the customers
<BR>
consider important?
