So it's 2AM and I'm flicking through a thousand channels of
<BR>
crap on satellite television and I hear, &quot;People often ask
<BR>
me if I'm some sort of Frankenstein.&quot;  This grabs my
<BR>
attention, so I keep watching.  &quot;Yes, I think I am.&quot;  And
<BR>
then, to my surprise, a name appears on the screen.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hugo de Garis&quot;
<BR>
<P>Cue sensationalism.  We see the Bomb, we see human skulls,
<BR>
we see a post apocalyptic world, we see de Garis looking
<BR>
serious next to his Brain Machine.  All the while de Garis
<BR>
explains how he thinks AI has more destructive potential
<BR>
than nuclear weapons.  (Personally I find the idea of
<BR>
comparing intelligence to explosives rather disturbing.)

<P>Discovery Channel TV Documentary on the Prospects of a
Gigadeath Artilect War to Air in June 2000
<P>I finished (mid April 2000) 3 weeks of filming with
Discovery Channel in the UK, Belgium and Spain. The
resulting (10 minute screen time) TV documentary will
probably be called &quot;Brain Child&quot;. It deals with the
likelihood that there will be a major war over the issue of
species dominance and with people like me who build
increasingly intelligent artificial brains, plus the whole
ethical issue of whether such machines should be built in
the first place. Some of the filming sites were - Brussels'
Belgium Atomium monument, Ypres Belgium WW1 military
cemetery (infamous for first German gas attack), Bletchley
Park UK (world's first electronic computer, Collossus which
cracked the German Enigma code in WW2), CAM-Brain Machine
(CBM) at L&amp;H in Ieper Belgium, Mountains of the Moon in
Spain (utterly bleak), etc. This documentary TV film should
reach several hundred million people worldwide. Whether its
message will be too fantastical for most people to get their
minds around, or whether it will cause a storm of interest,
is unpredictable right now. We will have to wait until June
to see the reaction of its airing.
<P>The 3 weeks of filming which occured right in the middle of
me moving house utterly exhausted me.
<P>It is likely that this 10 minute piece will be streamed and
be made available on Discovery Channel's website. If so, I
will link to it from the front page of my web sites. Stay
tuned.
