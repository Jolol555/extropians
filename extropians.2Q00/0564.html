<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Billy Brown&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bbrown@transcient.com?Subject=RE:%20POL:%20Reaction%20to%20Microsoft%20Ruling&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000411000253.29388.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">bbrown@transcient.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;That, IMO, is what the government anti-trust folks have done. The Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;case isn't about protecting consumers from exploitative monopolies. Its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about protecting businesses from competition, at the expense of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;customers.
</EM><BR>
<P>IMO its not about protecting consumers or competitors.  It basically comes 
<BR>
down to the &quot;crabs-in-a-bucket&quot; syndrome.  Once any crab gets too close to 
<BR>
climbing out of the bucket, the other crabs will pull him right back in.  
<BR>
Gates &amp; Co. were the winners.  Problem is they won way too big.  The natural 
<BR>
reaction is to join forces against the big winner who leaves us all in the 
<BR>
dust.  I think it comes from our in-bred American fear of concentrated 
<BR>
power.
<BR>
<P>I can actually feel both sides of this issue, but if it were up to me, I 
<BR>
would have waited until MS actually abused their power in a big way before I 
<BR>
pulled the rug out.  I know Netscape would argue that they *did* abuse their 
<BR>
power.  But I don't buy that.  They were just way competitive and like 
<BR>
everybody else in the world they used their strengths for their own benefit. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have waited until they did something really dastardly, like 
<BR>
getting us all hooked on IE as freeware and then charging for it.  Or 
<BR>
crushing all contenders in the OS field and then gouging the consumer with 
<BR>
exhorbitant prices or a pay-per-use or software rental scheme (like I hear 
<BR>
they're working on).
