<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Amara:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I LOVED your post.  It echoes something I've come to appreciate in the last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;couple of years, especially the last few months; that is that consciously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cultivating behavior aimed at a SLOWER pace has substantial benefits in many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;aspects of my life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmmm... slowing? I would rather say that the slowing is a by-product of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; higher level of awareness (if the slowing occurs, but there are times I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still performing the same number of tasks, only I'm more aware of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; processes and probably more efficient).
</EM><BR>
<P>I keep a slower pace in order to pay more attention, make fewer mistakes. Doing
<BR>
it slowly, properly, saves more time in the end than going back and redoing it
<BR>
(less expensive too).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;In particular, I've come to appreciate working in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;garden around our house as I never had before.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My favorite part of gardening is the smell and feel of the soil.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm the same way. Dirt definitely has some intrinsically satisfying thing about
<BR>
it. The zen of dirt, the dirtness of dirt. Digging your own holes without mom
<BR>
and dad getting pissed off I'm sure adds something to the mix. The messier the
<BR>
better too. Building a meditation pond by hand, or grooming a stream to flow
<BR>
through a garden or yard in an aesthetic manner while at the same time
<BR>
maximizing native habitat is an interesting challenge.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;One sign of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is that I've begun to learn plant names, something that I never could manage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to do before.  Making myself a part of the life cycle of the plants
</EM><BR>
<P>I've always had trouble with nomenclature. Communicating an artificial name has
<BR>
always seemed so unnecessary to me. I guess I'm more of a primitivist.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Have you kept cut flowers long after they finished blooming and lie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wilted in their vases? Sometimes I do that with roses, in order to pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attention to their end-state beauty and notice their full cycle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Everything has its own cycle of time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In general, when I'm not working, (science is not easy for me, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though it's my main &quot;job&quot;), I'm attracted to tasks that put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me in a Zen state (&quot;flow&quot;) of mind. Cooking- especially those preparations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that require many steps and a concentration, gardening, playing music,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or painting or forms of careful body movement (aikido, yoga, feldenkrais).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These are all tasks that require a care and attention and have their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own pace and time and can heighten one's awareness; I'm sure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks can think of many others.
</EM><BR>
<P>I really enjoy cooking, especially on impulse or by improvisation. That Samurai
<BR>
Chef show I really enjoy watching, because its very much my own style: pick a
<BR>
main ingredient and improvise what you can with the materials at hand. Such
<BR>
skills come in handy up at the cabin when you haven't been into town for two
<BR>
weeks. You come up with some interesting recipes that are surprisingly good...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One of the biggest events that has forced (and continues to force)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my awareness into a more focussed state, as well as teaching me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more patience,is my current life and regular travels. I live in a country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Germany) where I'm not fluent in the language or customs yet. My previous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; country (USA) now appears as a foreign culture to me, even though I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the language. I have culture shock in each direction when I travel to and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the US. I carry a sense of being a misplaced person, not really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; belonging anywhere, but at the same time, I carry a strong sense of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being a human of this planet, forgetting about country borders.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've always been an alien here, in most places, though I haven't done much
<BR>
foreign travel since I was in the Air Force. The cultural dissonance between
<BR>
myself and the world around me has merely led to more introspection and self
<BR>
reliance.
