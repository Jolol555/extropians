AM,

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Then I must clarify my goals.  I don't want some Harvey Newstromish
</EM><BR>
person
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to exist in the future.  I want *this* current Harvey Newstrom to
</EM><BR>
continue
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to exist and evolve into the future.  I do not want him destroyed and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; replaced by a new Harvey Newstrom.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's an interesting goal to have.  However, I fear that it begs the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question as to why you have it in the first place.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I happen to be willing to &quot;die&quot; (or whatever) so long as a pretty recent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copy of me lives on.  (By pretty recent, I mean on the order of months,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe a year under extreme circumstances.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Your full posting seems to represent our respective positions accurately.
<BR>
We do have different goals for what we are trying to acheive by avoiding
<BR>
death.
<BR>
<P>It almost sounds like you are saying that the ends justifies the means.
<BR>
That is, as long as another person is similar enough to you to carry out
<BR>
your plans, you don't need to exist anymore.  You don't seem to want to
<BR>
continue living just because you like to be alive, but to acheive some
<BR>
future goals.  As long as someone else is programmed with your meme-set to
<BR>
carry out your goals, you seem ready to die.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why did you want to preserve your &quot;self&quot; (as such) in the first place?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't have a good proof for why I shouldn't die.  I just would like to
<BR>
avoid it.  It seems like you question whether self-preservation is a useful
<BR>
goal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; More to the point, if &quot;you&quot; turn out to be the program that's running on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fantastic machine that is your body, then shutting down a copy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shouldn't be too big a problem.  If you happen to be your current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness stream, or control over it, or whatever, then destroying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is a pretty big deal as far as our primitive desires are concerned.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is where the semantic problems come in.  We do not all agree on what is
<BR>
the self.  I don't know all the answers, but I find it hard to agree with a
<BR>
definition of self that allows selves I cannot detect.  I don't know if
<BR>
their are other copies of me.  How can they be me if I don't even know that
<BR>
they exist?  I think, therefore I am.  But I cannot think with the copy's
<BR>
brain, anymore than I can think with your brain.  Until I get a replacement
<BR>
brain that I can think with, the replacement is unacceptable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I take it as axiomatic that our goals, our ends, are what we are striving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for; that the correct goals/ends are the correct things to strive for.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With that in mind, do we have it as a goal to preserve our current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness stream?
</EM><BR>
<P>I do.  If self-preservation is just to create a new individual and allow
<BR>
ourselves to die, then why limit ourselves to exact copies?  Why not make
<BR>
better individuals?  Why not genetically engineer our children or build a
<BR>
race of superior robots?  All of these may be fine goals, but they have
<BR>
nothing to do with my personal survival.  If continuing this current
<BR>
consciousness stream is not the goal, then why make the copy similar to me
<BR>
at all?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As far as I can tell, the answer is no.  My lizard brain has nothing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say about whether I'm an adjective, as John Clark has been known to put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, or a noun, as you might have it.  My intuitions just tell me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preserve &quot;myself,&quot; and to avoid &quot;death.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a twin.  He is not me.  I have had some people tell me that they
<BR>
couldn't tell us apart.  This does not convince me that I can die.  I still
<BR>
perceive an obvious difference between him and me.  I have never gotten us
<BR>
confused.  I am obviously in this body, and he is obviously in that body.
<BR>
No similarity in thinking or perceptions will suddently merge our
<BR>
consciousnesses into a single individual.  From that point of view, I must
<BR>
insist that different similar objects can and do exist.  The question is
<BR>
not, &quot;Does the universe need two Newstrom brothers?&quot;  The question is, &quot;Do I
<BR>
want to continue living?&quot;  I see no connection between these two queries.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In light of that, and in light of my other goals, it seems to me like it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be most efficacious to choose the definitions of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;death&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under which I'm best able to accomplish my goals.  Now, only *I* have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; special knowledge of my own goals, and therefore *I* am in a unique
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; position to pursue them.  But as far as I can tell, the most useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definition (from the point of view of my goals) is the &quot;adjectival&quot; view.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know what you are saying, but it sounds too much like fudging the answer.
<BR>
A lot of people on this list like to choose definitions that best support
<BR>
their goals.  Sometimes reality is not cooperative.  Sometimes things are
<BR>
not the way we want them to be.  I think we need to answer the questions
<BR>
about reality first, and then choose goals that are possible within that
<BR>
reality.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So why should I care about consciousness streams?  What sort of goals ARE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you pursuing that makes it a good idea to decide that &quot;avoiding your own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; death&quot; means &quot;maintaining control over this very consciousness stream&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For they seem to be drastically different from mine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Continuing my consciousness stream is my goal.  You seem to discount this
<BR>
goal and ask what other good goals come out of my life.  If I can't come up
<BR>
with any great purpose for my life, should I kill myself?  Maybe I will
<BR>
think up a great purpose later.  For now, maybe I'll just stick around for
<BR>
the entertainment value.  Continuing consciousness is a goal in and of
<BR>
itself.  If this stops, why would I care about any other goals that occur
<BR>
afterwards?
