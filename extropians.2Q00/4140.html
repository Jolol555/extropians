<EM>&gt;  &gt; Can anyone clear this up for me: if they have light signals emitted from

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; entered the chamber, what is preventing me from constructing a very long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; chamber of this sort from here to Alpha Centauri and then conducting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; transmissions through it with no delay whatsoever?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Because it doesn't scale (quantum entanglement does though), and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still need a relativistic channel to distinguish the signal from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noise.
</EM><BR>
<P>I still don't get it, what noise? If I'm sitting at the far end of this
<BR>
thing with a photodetector then it should only be going off when photons
<BR>
hit it as they exit the far end. How will there be noise? And what is
<BR>
preventing me from scaling it up and spitting out a continuous stream of
<BR>
photon packets?

<EM>&gt; Since superluminal information transfer is equivalent to time travel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (and hence paradoxes etc.), don't expect true ansible real soon.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am confused here too. I don't see how this would be time travel.
<BR>
Isn't there a distinction between information flow (images of events...
<BR>
say pictures we see in a telescope of a supernova blowing up) and the
<BR>
actual event generating the information? So what if I can transmit
<BR>
a digital pic of the supernova blowing up to someone far away before
<BR>
they can see it in their telescope- that isn't really time travel as
<BR>
far as I can see. The supernova has still already blown up whether or
<BR>
not they can see it yet. Light does not create time. Movements of
<BR>
atoms creates the illusion of time.
