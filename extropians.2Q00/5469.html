Subject: Re: FWD (EXT) Re: Commie nonsense
<BR>
<P>I thought we can only evaluate
<BR>
an  experiment in a scientific sense
<BR>
if the (starting) conditions suggested
<BR>
by the theory were set.
<BR>
<P>As we know, this was not the case,
<BR>
Marx recommended 1. the economically,
<BR>
technologically most developed
<BR>
countries that were producing goods
<BR>
in abundance 2. Countries with
<BR>
reasonable standard of literacy and
<BR>
some experience in (bourgois) democracy.
<BR>
<P>Mike LaTorra replies:
<BR>
Do you mean countries like Germany? Or Czechoslovakia? Or perhaps Hungary?
<BR>
Or do you restrict your classification of &quot;most advanced&quot; to the USA at the
<BR>
beginning of the 20th century?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the countries I listed first are acceptable candidates for Marxism,
<BR>
then clearly the experiment has been tried and failed, but not for lack of
<BR>
trying. The blood, sweat and tears of numerous unwilling &quot;experimental
<BR>
subjects&quot; show that the only thing most of them were willing to risk their
<BR>
lives for was trying to escape from their respective &quot;workers' paradise&quot;
<BR>
States.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if you think only the USA qualified for Marxism, then please
<BR>
explain why, when Leon Trotsky visited America, he concluded that it did not
<BR>
need a revolution. Was he insufficiently Marxist for you?
<BR>
<P><P>Terry:
<BR>
The failure was not due to &quot;communism&quot;
<BR>
but to its absence.
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
LOL! Are you the Pope of Marxism, or do you have some evidence and arguments
<BR>
to support your pontifications?
<BR>
<P>Terry:
<BR>
So this is the usual ignorant and crappie
<BR>
strawman propaganda....
<BR>
<P><P>Mike:
<BR>
Yes, that's certainly the way your statements seem to me. I have made a
<BR>
thorough study of Soviet Marxism using documents in English and Russian, and
<BR>
although I can fault the Russian Marxists for much, I cannot fault them for
<BR>
being insufficiently Marxist.
<BR>
<P>Terry:
<BR>
...and I won't join Forteana
<BR>
to put them right...  but Terry - pass this on,
<BR>
I'm sure it is off-topic there, too, but if anyone
<BR>
wants a (decent!) argument, you may pass my email
<BR>
address...
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
A decent argument is not what you have given us, but merely in your words
<BR>
&quot;the usual ignorant and crappie strawman propaganda&quot; for which Marxists have
<BR>
become justly famous. If you want to debate the facts of Marxism in
<BR>
practice, I've got the facts to back up my claims. If you want to debate
<BR>
Marxist theory, then please don't waste my time because Marxist theory bears
<BR>
as little resemblance to reality as cartoon physics.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, if Marxism is so great, yet it has failed everywhere it has been
<BR>
tried with utterly catastrophic results, then why would any advanced country
<BR>
want to try it? Just to disprove Marx once and for all at an even greater
<BR>
cost in human misery?
<BR>
<P>Regards to friends of freedom everywhere,
<BR>
<P>Michael LaTorra
