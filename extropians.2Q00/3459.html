<EM>&gt; You may be right Anders, but I can see a way around this particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument.  If male sex drive decreases during a long-winter induced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depression, then presumably it would result in fewer October babies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps this would compensate for the otherwise higher number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; October babies caused by increased face time by mates in January
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and February.  Presumably an April or May baby in the far north
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have a higher probability of survival?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The argument then would be ancient populations were much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limited by food shortages than by lack of sexual activity.
</EM><BR>
<P>This certainly makes sense, at least in far northern areas. It is
<BR>
interesting to note that seasonal affective disorder is most common in
<BR>
Scandinavia and among people descended from scandinavians. Also,
<BR>
testosterone levels are apparently lower in early spring which could
<BR>
also be an evolved control.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have only myself to experiment upon, but I find it interesting that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my own appetite decreases noticeably in the darkest months.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could see where this would create a survival advantage in those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; populations that had this feature, if they lived in the far northern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; latitudes.  Someone here has said evolution does not work at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this level but still I cannot understand why not.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems like a gene for SAD would likely spread just due to less
<BR>
chance of babies being born in the wrong season, so i think your idea
<BR>
makes much sense. There are likely other similar ways of controlling
<BR>
when reproduction occurs, but since we evolutionarily speaking left
<BR>
the tropics yesterday (where the seasons and food availability are
<BR>
different and presumably human reproduction can be done the year
<BR>
arond) there is no rigid reproduction control like in most other
<BR>
animals, rather just influences of likeliehood of reproducing.
