<P><EM>&gt; How about areas of the country were noticeable concentrations of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minerals are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found in the soil?  Wouldn't this method tend to remove the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minerals and make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the soil more mineral free?

<P>Yes, but if conventional agricultural methods were used (plowing, in
<BR>
particular), you'd end up destabilizing the soil and causing erosion of the
<BR>
soil and pollution of streams.
<BR>
<P>This same technique of mining the soil can be used in other contexts.  For
<BR>
example, comfrey, which grows rapidly and abundantly in some areas, tends to
<BR>
concentrate nitrogen in its leaves, and it can thus be used as a homegrown
<BR>
fertilizer.  I use plants with deep taproots, such as the mescal bean tree
<BR>
(which is also a nitrogen fixing legume) (the seed is also highly
<BR>
hallucenogenic) to draw minerals up from deep down.
<BR>
<P>An oil drilling company bulldozed a swath a mile long and a 150 feet wide
<BR>
through my land (they made a mistake--thought they were on a completely
<BR>
different tract of land).  This was several years ago, and it's been
<BR>
interesting to watch the order in which plants have regrown.  The small
<BR>
legumes like partridge pea and sensitive plant came first; then larger
<BR>
legumes, like false indigo and other rugged pioneer plants like camphor
<BR>
weed.  Each year, these pioneers would deposit leaves, and in the case of
<BR>
annuals, their whole bodies, into the soil, slowly building it up from
<BR>
barren sand to post oak/hickory forest (well, to be more accurate,
<BR>
savannah). These pioneer plants were getting some of their nutrients from
<BR>
the air (nitrogen, for example); but they were also pulling them out of the
<BR>
ground and concentrating them in the upper part of the soil where they could
<BR>
be used by other plants.
<BR>
<P>Some plants are good at mining the soil for water and making it available to
<BR>
other plants around them. I think it would be possible to reclaim quite a
<BR>
lot of desert land for food production using soil-mining techniques.
