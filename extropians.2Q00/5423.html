<EM>&gt; Suppose I started selling dirt, at the price of 30$/ounce. I set up an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internet business, dirtforsale.com, and take credit cards, and ship dirt to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whoever wants it. I'd assume that nobody thinks that I should not be allowed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do this. Obviously, it's a stupid idea, but there's no reason I should 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not be allowed to do it. But then assume that people start to buy it. I do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an IPO, I become a billionaire, and people spend maybe 5% of their incomes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on my dirt. They're using it to decorate the floors of their homes suppose. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I make deals with construction companies telling them that if they want to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; put Haradon Dirt in any of the homes they construct, they have to put it in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every single one. I imagine that at this point, there would be a suit 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against me by carpet manufactureurs for anti-competitive practices, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accusations that my dirt is unfairly priced, which would also be the basis 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of many suits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So at what point would my freedom to produce and sell a product be a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; secondary consideration to the effect on society that it has?
</EM><BR>
<P>It is a fuzzy line - at what point does free speech become incitement
<BR>
to riot or libel or whatever? The exclusionary contracts in your
<BR>
example start getting you into the grey area between your freedoms and
<BR>
everybody else's, but it's not like anybody really _needs_ a chic dirt
<BR>
floor or they couldn't buy it from someone else. So long as you're not
<BR>
the sole supplier of some magical anti-cancer dirt, or you've bought up
<BR>
all the economically exploitable sources, I'm content to let you do
<BR>
whatever you like with it.
