<EM>&gt; |&gt; Oh boy, a futuristic, nazi mailing list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the olden days, there existed a bunch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans called the ``futurists''. They later
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; became fascists (in Italy) and communists (in Russia).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Change is certain, progress is not.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Quite right. Worse still, the potential for fascism often has
<BR>
very little to do with the doctrinal content of the
<BR>
church/movement/organization that becomes fascist. &quot;We're
<BR>
libertarians! Libertarians CAN'T be fascists by definition!&quot;
<BR>
(That would be precisely the moment to get worried, and, above
<BR>
all, to whip out your can o' philosophical whoop-ass.) It's more
<BR>
a question of how the prominent figures in a movement conduct
<BR>
themselves.
<BR>
<P>But it's quite difficult to know how to predict fascism. A lot
<BR>
of studies were done after WWII, though, which shed some light
<BR>
on the matter. There are certainly some disturbing signs among
<BR>
members of Extropians (but, of course, it's not clear how less
<BR>
present such signs would be on any other list): a VERY strong
<BR>
&quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality, strong resentment towards groups
<BR>
thought to have more power than they deserve (environmentalists,
<BR>
Jews, feminists, etc., etc., etc. -- the circumcision
<BR>
discussions are always good for a laugh: no, no, seriously,
<BR>
these ZOG minions -- or would that be &quot;minion&quot;?... -- can
<BR>
certainly be annoying; but the point about the danger manifest
<BR>
in the reaction is _attitude_, not _content_).
<BR>
<P>The danger is particularly great among a group that generally
<BR>
doesn't believe in the irrational (in the Freudian, not
<BR>
cognitive or neuro-psychological sense), in part because such a
<BR>
group generally won't agree with, or understand the force of,
<BR>
the point above about the irrelevance of doctrinal content.
<BR>
<P>Speaking of Italy and Russia, I'm thinking of the end of Buber's
<BR>
anti-Marxist book, _Paths in Utopia_: I think the risk, if not
<BR>
underbelly, of Extropianism is &quot;Rome&quot;; elements of the WTA:
<BR>
perhaps &quot;Moscow&quot;; the alternative? Well, probably not Jerusalem,
<BR>
as Buber predicted... -- let's say Stockholm.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, any attmpt to articulate an alternative, to
<BR>
take a stand against elements of contemporary society, creates a
<BR>
risk: &quot;Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.&quot;
<BR>
<P>And saying more with less (also known as &quot;negative dialectics&quot;)
<BR>
may not minimize the risk much, except insofar as it lapses into
<BR>
quietism (i.e. to be Hamlet or not-Hamlet).
<BR>
<P>Goodward!
