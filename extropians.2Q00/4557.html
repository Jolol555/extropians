<P>
When I was a kid my father gave me this advice, which I've remembered ever
<BR>
since:  Concentrate on collecting knowledge and wisdom rather than material
<BR>
things.  Material things can always be stolen or destroyed or lost some
<BR>
other way, but your mind is always your own [I remember thinking at the
<BR>
time:  yeah, except if somebody gives you weird drugs and brainwashes
<BR>
you--I'd recently seen *The Manchurian Candidate*]. With a well-developed
<BR>
mind you can always get the material stuff when you need it.
<BR>
<P>I used to believe strongly in saving and investing.  At one point in my life
<BR>
I had a pretty impressive net worth.  Then in the late 80's two things
<BR>
happened to depress the Texas economy:  there was legislation which
<BR>
radically altered the federal tax treatment of real estate, which caused
<BR>
real estate prices to plummet; and around the same time, the price of oil
<BR>
fell dramatically, which also had a depressing effect on the Texas economy.
<BR>
Suddenly, people who'd been good risks (financially) couldn't pay their
<BR>
bills.  Even if you'd made secured loans, your collateral would often be
<BR>
tied up in bankruptcy estates. My business went belly-up, and many of my
<BR>
investments lost half or more of their value.
<BR>
<P>The situation in Texas in the late 80's was just a minor glitch, but living
<BR>
through it has helped me to extend my imagination to visualize more
<BR>
extensive economic depressions. Saving money for a particular expenditure,
<BR>
such as starting or expanding a business, buying a house, etc. makes quite a
<BR>
lot of sense to me.  But investing just for the sake of investing doesn't,
<BR>
unless you appraoch it like playing a game, for the fun of it. (An exception
<BR>
to this would be if you have inside information about a company or companies
<BR>
you're investing in.)
<BR>
<P>If your goal is to have money to live on when you retire or to self-insure
<BR>
for medical expenses, the best investment over the long term is probably to
<BR>
hold relatively short-term low-risk bonds until they mature. When they
<BR>
mature, use the proceeds to purchase more of the same.  Because the bonds
<BR>
are low risk, they'll also carry low interest rates, but there's a high
<BR>
probability that the money will be there when you need it.  Because they're
<BR>
short term, you can hold them to maturity without suffering damage from
<BR>
inflation.
<BR>
<P>My opinion is that the net economic effect of the stock market is
<BR>
destructive for some of the same reasons socialist economies don't work
<BR>
well.  I'm waiting for permission from a friend to quote a piece she wrote
<BR>
about the stock market.
<BR>
