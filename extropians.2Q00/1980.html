<EM>&gt; &gt;The issue isn't downloads, its hardcopy, and I'd be very interested in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;finding sources of cds for 2-3 dollars. The utility cost of downloading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;100M or more, especially if your local phone usage rates are not capped,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is less than going out and buying the CD.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So for you, software isn't free unless the supplier puts it onto some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physical storage medium and brings it to you for no charge?  If that's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case then, for you, there will probably never be STAAFL.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you download the software, you still need a backup copy of the download. Burn
<BR>
to CD? Ok, thats another hour or so of your time and another buck or so for a
<BR>
blank  CD-R ($20/hr + $1.25/CD-R = $21.25). Or you can use a Zip disk at $10 a
<BR>
pop plus 15 minutes of my time ($10 + $5.00 = $15.00). What people don't
<BR>
understand is that what the 'free software' deal is about is that it really
<BR>
isn't free, its just externalizing costs. You do pay for it one way or another.
<BR>
When you need tech support, you have to either spend a couple hours or more
<BR>
researching existing databases, or call up and pay one of the Linux-Inc startups
<BR>
for tech support help. The online help and the system help on every
<BR>
implementation I've seen is poor (when you get it in English), and books always
<BR>
seem to miss important information, either because they want you to call for
<BR>
support too, or else they expect you to spend a couple-leven days wading through
<BR>
the entirety of a 1500 page manual.
<BR>
<P>True free software is trouble free software. How likely is that?
