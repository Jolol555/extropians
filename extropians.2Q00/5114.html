<EM>&gt;Many people here on the list know that I did not have the best experience 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the used Jeep Cherokee I bought. I basically got hosed. However, I'm 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;now to the point where the money it has cost me so far is now less than 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what a new one would have cost me for the same utility. This is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the first time I've ever gotten a bad deal on a used vehicle, and I've 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;owned four different used vehicles prior to this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(this is the second I've bought from a dealer).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not familiar with your experiences with Jeeps, but your
<BR>
statement is congruent with my experiences with them.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- One of my uncles came from a ranching background, went into
<BR>
the Marines in the early-to-mid fifties, and came back with a profound
<BR>
respect and desire for Jeep products.  For the rest of his life, he
<BR>
bought Jeeps of all kinds and types.  His profession was realtor in
<BR>
some pretty rugged territory in NE California and he was constantly
<BR>
bemoaning how his Jeeps would crumble under the strain ( except for
<BR>
the early versions).  The rest of the family tried for years to get
<BR>
him to try something, anything, else, but he never would.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- During the middle seventies, I spent some time doing
<BR>
ranching work in the Diablo range of central California, east of
<BR>
'silicon valley'.  My vehicle was a late-forties ex-Army Jeep that had
<BR>
been abandoned there.  My great-uncle and I rebuilt it, scrounging
<BR>
parts where we could, and building what we could not.  It was not the
<BR>
best looking or best mileage vehicle, but it could go damn near
<BR>
anywhere.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In the late seventies, one of my roommates bought a
<BR>
brand-new, fully loaded, very pricey Cherokee.  The list of aliments
<BR>
that this beast suffered would run into the megabytes.  It ran through
<BR>
two engines, three transmissions, a differential, a drive shaft, a set
<BR>
of wheel bearings (all around) and that was just the major components
<BR>
that I remember.  This was just a freeway cruiser, no rough stuff.  He
<BR>
sold it after two or three years and bought a Toyota.
<BR>
<P>Me? I drive a Landcruiser.  I may buy a Sequoia in a couple of years.
