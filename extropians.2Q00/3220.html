Just getting back into this...

| ----- Original Message -----
<BR>
| From: White, Ryan
<BR>
|
<BR>
| Assertion: I would count myself a definite advocate of human
<BR>
| meta-programming, genetic manipulation, and interfacing with
<BR>
microprocessor
<BR>
| technology.  I recognize humanity as a beautiful actualization of
<BR>
classical
<BR>
| evolution, but also that we are on the verge of accelerated, directed
<BR>
| evolution via advanced technologies.  I embrace human self-modification
<BR>
(and
<BR>
| what the heck, why not our evolutionary cousins?  Why not our ecosystem?).
<BR>
| But, as with any new technology, I think it necessary to consider the
<BR>
social
<BR>
| and economic implications.
<BR>
<P>Absolutely agreed - a strong sense of responsibility to individuals and to
<BR>
the species is vital to any such undertaking.
<BR>
<P>| Personally, I'd love to affect genetic optimization of my offspring.  But
<BR>
I
<BR>
| think we need to be aware of the issues that arise: For example, the
<BR>
'haves'
<BR>
| will have 'better' offspring, while the 'have-nots' won't be able to
<BR>
afford
<BR>
| all the 'kinder-mods'.
<BR>
<P>Excellent point - I don't have a good answer, just a comparison or two:
<BR>
Private School vs. Public School, Private Healthcare vs. Public
<BR>
Healthcare...
<BR>
<P>| And what happens if and when everybody can afford
<BR>
| it?  Are we all going to optimize our offspring's genetic predispositions
<BR>
| towards some arbitrarily-chosen 'superior quality set'?  There goes the
<BR>
| genetic diversity of the human race. It would be sad if humans turned out
<BR>
to
<BR>
| have a gene pool like the poor cheetahs.
<BR>
<P>Another excellent point.  Dan Adams' thoughts re: Dynamic DNA/genetic
<BR>
programming (below) might help us address this concern - you allow for
<BR>
natural genetic variance, while boosting the likelihood of &quot;positive&quot;
<BR>
mutations (Dan, apologies if I'm butchering your concept).  This, of course,
<BR>
doesn't make a lot of sense when shooting for a particular adaptation (i.e.
<BR>
brain/microprocessor interface), but...
<BR>
<P>|| Dan Adams Wrote:
<BR>
|| What if we ask how we can create dynamic DNA rather
<BR>
|| than allowing ourselves to fall down the slippery
<BR>
|| slope of ethical considerations attached with
<BR>
|| prescribing physical conditions to our progeny?
<BR>
|| Without making any appeal to a non-corporeal
<BR>
|| information existence, I can envision a
<BR>
|| semi-autonomous process (governed by a deep
<BR>
|| understanding of genetics) whereby not only are
<BR>
|| negative factors (e.g. potential disability and
<BR>
|| disease) precluded within the genetic programming, but
<BR>
|| only the best (read, &quot;really good&quot;) solutions are
<BR>
|| found.  All of this however without any hardwiring on
<BR>
|| the human designers part.
<BR>
|| The field currently known as genetic programming uses
<BR>
|| a highly dynamic matrix of factors which allow it to
<BR>
|| seek out a near-global optimum in a search space
<BR>
|| within highly constrained parameters.  The idea behind
<BR>
|| it (Holland, 1975) was originally derived from
<BR>
|| biology.  Now that it's been abstracted and perfected,
<BR>
|| let's use it in biology again.  This time to produce
<BR>
|| the next generation of people.  You can design better
<BR>
|| people without definite specifications of what they
<BR>
|| must be and without falling into the dangerous
<BR>
|| &quot;eugenics&quot; zone...
<BR>
<P>| What happens if the environment
<BR>
| changes drastically, say, due to an asteroid impact that we failed to
<BR>
| prevent because nobody funded the hurtling-space-rock-defense program?
<BR>
Will
<BR>
| we have the genetic diversity to ensure the continued survival of our
<BR>
kind?
<BR>
<P>See above - I really don't foresee a homo sapiens &quot;standard&quot;...  I guess
<BR>
it's possible that we could lose some variety over an extended period, but
<BR>
not enough to affect our ability to adapt.  I think society is the biggest
<BR>
threat to future human evolution, not technology.
<BR>
<P>| And is the process of deliberately manipulating your child's genetic
<BR>
| blueprint fair to the child?  It/he/she doesn't seem to have much of a
<BR>
| choice in the matter at the time.  I can see it now: little Susan files a
<BR>
| lawsuit against her parents for giving her basketball genes when all she
<BR>
| ever wanted to be was a doctor.
<BR>
|
<BR>
<P>You can lead a horse to water...  If I am born with the ability to play
<BR>
basketball, it doesn't necessarily follow that I will, and, If I am born
<BR>
with the ability to communicate with machines, it doesn't necessarily follow
<BR>
that I will choose to do that either.  There are certain types of
<BR>
manipulation (visible physical aspects, personality &quot;enhancement&quot;) which are
<BR>
obviously more dangerous than others...  I think we'll have to let society
<BR>
draw the lines.
<BR>
<P>| As for direct interface between the nervous system and computer
<BR>
technology,
<BR>
| it seems like an obvious and tangible transhumanist endeavor.
<BR>
<P>Yep.
<BR>
<P>| I spend a lot
<BR>
| of my time pondering the integration of the human nervous system and
<BR>
| microprocessors (and also the extensions of that basic interface -
<BR>
| telepathy, anyone?
<BR>
<P>Telepathy sounds incredibly wonderful - but I don't think we have the
<BR>
genetic basis for any sort of wireless brain-brain communication.  Throw in
<BR>
the right machinery though...
<BR>
<P>| I would love to connect and learn from people with a
<BR>
| similar vision.
<BR>
<P>So would I.
<BR>
<P>| If any of you bright people know of anybody out there
<BR>
| working on making this possible, I would be very interested in initiating
<BR>
| contact with them.  I actually have an outline for an experiment I would
<BR>
| love to try, on animal or insect models.
<BR>
<P>I'm considering the possibility of putting together a business plan.  The
<BR>
initial goal would be to obtain funding for an extended period of research
<BR>
into the biological and computer technology aspects of this concept.  An
<BR>
early milestone might be the submission of a comprehensive &quot;Advanced
<BR>
Human-Computer Interaction&quot; RFC to IEEE and other standards organizations.
<BR>
There is a lot of money being spent on HCI research, which I see this as an
<BR>
extension of.  Ideas, anyone?
<BR>

| Subject: a new thread
<BR>
|
<BR>
| Any thoughts on human genetic manipulation?  Say, with the purpose of
<BR>
| creating a workable interface between an electronic microprocessor and a
<BR>
| human mind?  Throw in some nanotechnology for physical interaction...
<BR>
| Education equates to software development...  Implications?
