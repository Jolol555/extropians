<EM>&gt; The stimulant analogy connects for me to the &quot;Prozac poop-out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that many people experience at around seven years on SSRIs.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seemingly SSRIs are hard for the body's homeostatic mechanisms to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work around.  Maybe it even takes seven years.  Which would make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heck of a lot of sense because the speculated mechanism whereby you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develop a tolerance for SSRIs is that you actually prune
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connections,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; losing synapses to get the data rates (where?) back to where they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to be.  Scary stuff.  There just aren't any long term studies.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;Can you please provide refs on this ?
<BR>
&nbsp;I don't even like the idea of a bad hair cut!
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly how bad do the drug companies want to prove that you lose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; synapses?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't understand this, wouldn't they want to *disprove* it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I was pretty worried about being expected to be a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sheep and take high doses of SSRIs as permanent maintenance for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think they should be used only temporarily if this synaptic
<BR>
business is true.

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; St. John's Wort, an herb available as capsules at most any health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; food store, has significant SSRI effects.   For some reason, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact doesn't seem to get into press much.  Even the people who make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the capsules tout the mood benefits, but not the Prozac connection.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I like the fact that you don't have to deal with the AMA and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prescription drug establishment to gain access to the current state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the art in antidepressants.  
</EM><BR>
<P>This shows one of the risks of the &quot;herbal vs chemical&quot; mindset.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Playing with your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neurotransmitters is risky, and far from an exact science.
</EM><BR>
<P>Especially as our knowledge is incomplete. 
<BR>
<P>A true, not hypothetical situation known to me
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Patient feels anxious.
<BR>
&nbsp;Doctor diagnoses anxiety and related problems.
<BR>
&nbsp;Doctor believes hypothesis of serotonin transmission problems.
<BR>
&nbsp;Therefore as patient has anxiety, etc, they are prescribed SSRI.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Patient is never actually biochemically checked for serotonin
<BR>
&nbsp;(admittedly this is difficult) before during or after use of SSRI.
<BR>
&nbsp;So treatment is based on induction from other data without checking
<BR>
&nbsp;the situation in the individual patient.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;And meanwhile SSRI maybe has unknown side effects??
