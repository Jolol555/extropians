<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; No time to comment on everything this morning, but the above point of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; view
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; clearly means Lorrey means anything and everything can be redefined as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; military target.  In other words, any war is always total war and any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; engaging in war that thinks it has right on its side -- and what nation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; going to war claims it doesn't -- can bomb and kill indiscriminately.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No, that is NOT what I mean. You cannot specifically target civilians,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; buildings that don't contribute to the war effort (and propaganda is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; contribution to the war effort, so a TV station IS a legitimate target),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree in regards to TV stations.  I think, in particular, the TV
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stations were bombed to prevent non-NATO media from operating.  (Not that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Milosevic supported or defended free media.  In fact, during and after the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bombing, he basically did everything in his power to stop all but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pro-Milosevic media from functioning.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Any communications capability not under allied control is to be
<BR>
considered an asset of the enemy. Sure one station was 'opposition'
<BR>
controlled, but they were loyal opposition, not armed resistance. There
<BR>
is a difference
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hospitals, schools, prisons, etc. However, there is a difference between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; targeting a non-combatant, and accidentally killing a non-combatant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; collateral damage while in the course of attacking a legitimate target.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree about the difference between targeting and accidentally hitting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone or something.  Even so, there is a such thing as accidents and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willful negligence in targeting.  For instance, if one bombs a target in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population center, I think any civilian deaths and destrcution of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nonmilitary propert might be regarded as willful neglegence -- and not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mere accident.
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't know much about warfare. IMHO, any civilian dumb enough to
<BR>
remain in the vicinity of a military installation during a war is merely
<BR>
aiding evolution when he gets whacked.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; See _The Globe and Mail_ article at:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.globeandmail.com/gam/TopNational/20000522/UBOMBM.html">http://www.globeandmail.com/gam/TopNational/20000522/UBOMBM.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wherein Canadian commanders admit to probably hitting civilians despite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extreme precautions.  (For the record, this does NOT look like the Yugoslav
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forces put their bases there because NATO air strikes were in the offing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but rather because they'd always been there.  The last time Yugoslavia was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bombed was during WW2.)  I also wonder, given the description of the target
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; selection process -- if indeed this was the process used by all NATO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; missions -- why was the Chinese embassy bombed, from three separate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directions no less?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In this case -- bombing Yugoslavia -- the innocent shields of threats
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument can't really be used.  Yugoslavia was not an aggressor by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; international standards.  The fact that it did not consent to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rambouillet terms is not grounds for warfare, especially if one looks at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terms, which basically included provisions for NATO to occupy all of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yugoslavia.  Has Lorrey read the terms?
</EM><BR>
<P>No I have not, and I'd like to read them on a non-Serbian or non-serbian
<BR>
sympathizer website.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; civilian with brains will stay as far away from any military target as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Bridges are and always have been considered primary military targets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; See below.  I don't necessarily disagree on bridges, though the argument
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about staying away from targets kinds of goes against Lorrey's argument
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; later on about bombing Dresden.  Since Dresden was an arts Mecca, one would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspect that it would not be a primary or even secondary target.  (Again:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the real reason for bombing Dresden had to do with satisfying the Soviets --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not with helping the war effort.  That is, unless one considers do any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one's allies whims helping the war effort.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure the Soviets did not want a city full of uppity elitists around
<BR>
when they decided to impose their socialist state on east Germany. The
<BR>
story goes, though, that the Soviets asked the Americans to target the
<BR>
rail yards specifically because it was a crucial junction (thus it was
<BR>
not a non-important target, rail yards are a legitimate target) in the
<BR>
German rail network, and could be used to reinforce german forces
<BR>
fighting against the Soviet onslaught. Bomber Harris got wind of the
<BR>
raid and had to beat them to it with his own carpet bombing methods, and
<BR>
he targeted the city, not the rail yards.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I recall the bombing of the train bridge.  The pilot saw the train after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; dropping his first load and went back and bombed again.  The NATO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spokesman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; claimed, &quot;He bombed in good faith.&quot;  What, pray tell, would bombing in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; faith&quot; be?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Bombing in bad faith is specifically bombing a target that you are aware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; large number of non-combatants in the target zone. This is called an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atrocity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If you drop a bomb, knowing the target is clear, and while the bomb is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dropping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a non-combatant runs into the target area, that is not an atrocity, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stupidity on the part of the non-combatant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Recall, in the case I mentioned, he bombed, the train entered the target
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; area then he rebombed.  So, by Lorrey's standard, the first drop was &quot;good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faith,&quot; the second &quot;bad faith.&quot;  (If he thinks the commuter train moved into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the target area because its engineer saw the bridge being demolished, this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is something he'll have to prove.  The specifics of the case _seem_ to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the train was moving and its engineer unaware of the bombing.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Except that the site was NOT rebombed, according to Pentagon data, that
<BR>
is just a made up story to make the US look bad.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, are you saying the Germans were housing POWs in the city, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shields? That, in itself, is a war crime.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The Germans, to my knowledge, did not know Dresden was going to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bombed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Up until February of 1945, to my knowledge, Dresden had never been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heavily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; bombed AND it was not a military center -- being mainly an &quot;arts&quot; Mecca.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; They didn't know when any place was going to be bombed. That is not an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excuse.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But according to Lorrey's other material on this, he gives one the idea that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; civilians can expect to know where not to be not to get bombed.  I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to keep going back and forth on this.  Suffice to say, we disagree here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it does not appear agreement will be forthcoming, perhaps not until both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of us cogitates on this for a bit.
</EM><BR>
<P>Civilians should know from history that infrastructure, like bridges,
<BR>
are top priority targets, because they allow the easy transportation of
<BR>
large amounts of military personnel and hardware. Civilians who persist
<BR>
in using such infrastructure during a war are willfully putting
<BR>
themselves at risk.
<BR>
<P>As for Germany, the british had already firebombed Hamburg and a dozen
<BR>
other industrial cities. Are the people who died in those conflagrations
<BR>
any less important? I suppose to an elitist, the 'artists' who lived in
<BR>
Dresden are more important than the industrial workers in Hamburg.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Note: We frequently bombed military industrial facilities where Jewish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slave
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; laborers worked. Should we be blamed for their deaths?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When one evaluates the effect of such bombing on the war, I think one could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at best say it was a wasted effort.  It would have been much better to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concentrate all bombing during the war on a) bombing specifically military
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; targets (e.g., sub bases, barracks, tactical military targets such as tanks)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and anything related to oil refining and storage.
</EM><BR>
<P>You obviously don't know anything at all about warfare if you make this
<BR>
statement. Bombing the military industrial complex was the most
<BR>
important goal of the war. If we had not done that it would have gone on
<BR>
for decades. Bombing ball bearing, ammunition, rocket, aircraft, and
<BR>
shipbuilding facilities were all crucial targets.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; [big snip I'll to get to later...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We don't kill the kids.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Who is this &quot;we&quot;?  Is Lorrey calling the shots down at the Pentagon?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You are blaming America in general, and I am an American, so it is 'we'. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; note
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that you avoid replying to the rest of my comments here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then let me restate.  I do NOT blame the US in general.  I blame its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government at the time, specifically those in charge and those who carried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out their missions without question.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even if I did mean blaming the US as a whole -- which I did NOT -- then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; response should never be to defend US as a whole.  (In fact, I've looked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over my passed emails.  I've mostly used &quot;US government.&quot;  I've been pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; restrained on using &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Americans.&quot;  The context should have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparent that when I did so I was not blaming every last American.  Also, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accept no guilt for the actions of others, so I hardly include myself in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such collectivizations.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let me also state that I don't have time to comment on every single comment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here.  If Lorrey would use his eyes to read, he would have noted that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stated in my last post on this thread with &quot;No time to comment on everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this morning...&quot;  Some of us have jobs and don't live for this list, okay?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; [another big snip I'll to get to later...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, I recall some 45 people were killed before the bombings began.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; course, the claims of the KLA Are to be beleived while any Serb sources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; total liars.  Genocide on a scale to match...  Waco not Hitler.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suppose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that justifies bombing all of Yugoslavia AND killing thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; civilians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There were far more than 45 people killed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree.  I've made a mistake here.  The NY Times claimed in 1999 that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approximately 2000 people were killed in all of 1998 in Kosovo.  Hardly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genocide considering that that figure might actually be an overestimate and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; includes Kosovar Serb deaths.  I.e., it combines KLA killings as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those caused by Yugoslav forces.  (The Serb page I cite below claims the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; death toll was 1200 and about 140 of those were Serbian.  Now, theyare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably biased, but 1200 is really not such a great underexaggeration of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2000.  I mean, if one is going to lie, why not say 500 people were killed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and 400 of them were Serbs?)
</EM><BR>
<P>They are still digging up bodies, so the numbers are not all yet in, and
<BR>
I personally don't consider the NY Times to be a very good newspaper.
<BR>
They are one of the worst of the biased media outlets, and they pick and
<BR>
choose what stories and facts they want to report.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My mistake was in regards to an alleged massacre January 15, 1999 in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; village of Racak in Kosmet which was reported widely before and during the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bombings to be in the thousands and the actual number was in the dozens or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe 15.  If my memory's correct, this &quot;massacre&quot; was a proximate trigger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the bombings.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I should add too, we must be very careful here since the Pentagon controls
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; media access in such campaigns.  Funny how little the Media and (Lorrey and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too many Americans) has (have) complained about this control.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Given the state of the media today, there is no treatment that is too
<BR>
good for them. When they decide to become a little less biased, I'll
<BR>
reconsider.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Where are you getting your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; information? By the time we started bombing, there were hundreds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousands as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; refugees and thousands of people killed, raped, and being used as human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shields.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've noticed Lorrey cites no sources.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cato's testimony about the issue is at:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.cato.org/testimony/ct-db031099.html">http://www.cato.org/testimony/ct-db031099.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It does not cite numbers of deaths in Kosovo, 
</EM><BR>
<P>So you pose a useless citation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<P>Merely criminals fleeing the scene of a crime. Much like Germans running
<BR>
for Argentina after the war...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, the bombing against Yugoslavia seems to not have stopped the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; killings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the region, but escalated them.  Was this the goal?  I don't think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; One should, after all, go to war with the notion to making things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; In other words, one fights because one thinks that the peace afterwards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; be better than the peace before the fight.  This should make war the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to a higher end and actual military actions can then be measured against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; whether they work toward this end or detract from it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If the Serbs did not want what is happening to them now, they should not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; given free reign to those who perpetrated the slaughter and rape of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ethnic albanians. What comes around goes around.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Excellent analysis!  Of course, Lorrey seems to assume that no Albanians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every did anything wrong here and that the Serbs as a whole deserve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; punishment.  In other words, if a Black man kills a White man up in Lorrey's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neck of the woods, watch out!  He might just show up in Comptom or Harlem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and kill a few Blacks.  After all, &quot;What comes around goes around.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>The Serbs, in general, are far more culpable for the large majority of
<BR>
crimes in the region. The World Court has made this asessment, and all
<BR>
human rights organzations agree.
<BR>
<P>As for me, if someone comes up and kills a friend or member of my
<BR>
family, and the justice system says, &quot;we don't want to enrage our black
<BR>
constitutency by actually prosecuting this person, why can't we all just
<BR>
get along peacefully...&quot; Then I will feel quite free to hunt down and
<BR>
wax that individual.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree, that, for the most part, all the leaders in the region, including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; KLA leaders are thugs and bullies.  If Lorrey really believes this, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is a great reason NOT to get involved -- as I've maintained all along.
</EM><BR>
<P>Law enforcement is required to enforce the law (in this case human
<BR>
rights) even in cases where criminals are commiting crimes on other
<BR>
criminals. They may not like it, but there are always innocents caught
<BR>
in the crossfire between such criminals, and those people deserve help.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;All we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do (and what the Europeans should have been doing but were to lazy and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; involved to pull their heads out of their asses) is try to keep the peace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; very volatile situation, or else we might as will blockade the whole area
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; give them all the guns they want so they can shoot it out until they've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; settled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their differences. These are the only two real options.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not so.  The truth is, the best thing to do, for the US and NATO would be to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just leave it alone and allow those who want to emigrate leave the region.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Truth be told, the peace has not been kept.  Kosovar Serbs are now being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; killed.  The KLA, with its dream of a Greater Albania, might destabilize the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; region even more, especially since it's laying claims to lands in Macedonia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and Greece.
</EM><BR>
<P>Any serbs being killed deserve what they get after participating in the
<BR>
atrocities against albanians.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If NATO and the US had stayed out of it, chances are Yugoslavia would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually disintegrated over the years as internal opposition mounted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Milosevic, but in the meantime the KLA would not be a loose canon rolling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; across the deck of the Balkan ship.
</EM><BR>
<P>And meanwhile hundreds of thousands of ethnica albanians would have been
<BR>
massacred by Milosevic and company. Bullshit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, I reiterate.  US involvement generally makes bad situations worse.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Look at the outcome of Iran (helped to keep the Shah in power insuring that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those yearning to be free from his tyranny would hate the US and the West),
</EM><BR>
<P>I, and I don't think any rational person, would regard the Ayatollah as
<BR>
valuing 'freedom', unless 'freedom' involved them being free to impose
<BR>
their views on everyone else. Such people are legitimately the enemies
<BR>
of the US and liberty, and deserve to get stomped.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Libya (US CIA helped put Qadafy in power),
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh, no they did not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Vietnam (overthrew elected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government in the South and eventually helped to destabilize Cambodia, Laos
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as well as lose the war), Colombia (currently working on this one), Somalia,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and so on.  This is not a track record of success with a few minor,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excusable failures.  Instead it is a track record of major failures with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few minor, unexpected successes.  (I'll leave it to Lorrey to show the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successes, if he can find any.)  If people would look at results rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intentions, they might be very wary of any foreign involvement.
</EM><BR>
<P>It sounds to me like you are living under the Chomskyite version of
<BR>
history. If so, you and I don't have much to talk about.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Once again, Europe is asking us to pull their nuts out of the fire, and if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't do it just the way they want us to, they try to blame us for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thing. Sometimes I think we should tell them all to piss off.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think, for the most part, the US should remain out of it.  Europe has no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current looming threats to its security.  Even a rampant KLA probably will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only effect the Balkans and nowhere else.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, the KLA has an offshoot now trying to start something in the
<BR>
Serbian province of Presovo. NATO has been trying to shut them down to
<BR>
mixed results. There are also Albanian 'refugees' taking ships over to
<BR>
Italy and causing mayhem there. The Italian coast guard had a running
<BR>
battle with one such ship trying to prevent it from landing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while in Chechnya, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chechens started killing Russians first. While Serbia is small enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that we can do something about it, there is little we can do about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Russia except diplomatic protests.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; My point was that Russia could make the same claims about Chechnya that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lorrey could make about Yugoslavia.  In fact, the Russian policy with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Near Abroad and breakaway republics like Chechnya and Ingushtia has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; claim that ethnic Russians are being persecuted -- a claim not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; without merit -- and use this as a pretext for intervention.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Of course. And given the level to which fundamentalist Muslim terrorists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; percolating and penetrating in the 'Stans' these days, I'd be very worried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; willing to take action too if I were in the Kremlin.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This not only doesn't rebutt my claim above, Lorrey ignores what he said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; earlier.  First, he told us that &quot;Chechens started killing Russians first.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now he's telling us this is all based on justified paranoia.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is there anyone else on this list aside from Lorrey who thinks that the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recent Russian campaign against Chechnya was anything more than a ploy to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take the pressure off the Kremlin for the sad state of Russia's economy and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rife corruption there.  It's funny how the whole campaign was timed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right when Yeltsin's inner circle was starting to collapse and that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; catapulted Putin, the architect of the campaign, into the Presidency.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was nothing more than a massive and bloody PR campaign written with Chechan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and Russian blood.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I personally think the only reason they haven't been fighting all
<BR>
along was they couldn't afford it. Hitting the chechens does serve a
<BR>
legitimate law enforcement objective because Chechnya has served as a
<BR>
safe haven for the chornye smorodiny gangsters that have been such a
<BR>
problem throughout the former soviet states, and muslim fundamentalists
<BR>
operating out of Chechnya are responsible for several large building
<BR>
bombings in and around Moscow, backed by bin laden, and much like the US
<BR>
Embassy bombings in africa a couple years ago.
<BR>
<P>The fact is that Chechnya is NOT an independent country, only the
<BR>
Taliban of Afghanistan have recognised them as such (and who are the
<BR>
Taliban to judge), despite what you hear in the media.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's a shame that the American people will have to pay for these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; mistakes --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and not the politicians who make them.  But that's the nature of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; beast.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How are we going to pay for them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Americans will pay through blood and treasure, of course.  With the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; former,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; there is terrorism and war which will claim American lives.  I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; this is a justification for this, but merely human nature.  The orphaned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Iraqi or Serbian kid who turns to terrorism is not going to think about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; morality the same way Lorrey (I hope!) and I do.  He or she is mostly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be motivated by revenge against the US.  That urge would not be there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the US had either a) stayed the f*ck out it or b) been a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; restrained and civilized in flexing its muscles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Funny, until we started bombing, bleeding hearts like you were crying that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; were not doing enough to stop Milosevik. When are you ever going to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; satisfied?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lorrey is definitely wrong here.  I have been against US involvement in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; almost all foreign wars for the past decade or so.  I've especially been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against US involvement in the Balkans.  I've never called for any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involvement.  In fact, the Objectivist position on this, which I adhere to,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that no side in the conflict will provide a government which protects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual rights, so there is little point in supporting any of them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, since none of them, as yet, has made attacks on the US, there is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proximate justification for involvement.  (For the record, I don't think any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leader in the region will ten years from now be landing troops in Vermont.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats not quite true. There is a rational Objectivist justification for
<BR>
getting involved if Milosevic's bahavior impacts markets that the
<BR>
economy of Vermont depends upon. There is also a rational Objectivist
<BR>
justification for fighting against tyranny when an oppressed people have
<BR>
asked for help in the sense that you personally cannot live with
<BR>
yourself telling them 'tough'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact, I'm generally against intervention.  I've been pretty much an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isolationist since I've been old enough to vote.  (Of course, being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sympathetic to libertarian anarchism, I've generally been against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governemnt.  Sans government, it would be very hard to intervene.  Surely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people like Lorrey could join the foreign legion or send money to the KLA,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but that would leave the 99 and 44/100ths of everyone else out of it.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Very true, in a libertarian world, those would be rational things to
<BR>
expect, and making others pay for the demands upon my sense of justice
<BR>
is not right, though asking them to pay is another ball of wax entirely.
<BR>
I do know that a large number of Albanian Americans did join and/or fund
<BR>
the KLA. However, how far can such work get when Serbia is getting
<BR>
billions of dollars worth of weaponry sent to it by the Russian military
<BR>
industry (the real reason for the Balkan conflict, employment for
<BR>
russian weapons makers).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What I wonder is whether Lorrey will be a big enough man to apologize for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his mistake here.
</EM><BR>
<P>While I was not aware of your claims of consistent isolationism, and I
<BR>
did make an assumption that if you were promoting the propaganda of a
<BR>
Milosevic apologist (which is what that original post was) you were
<BR>
either one of the typical I-hate-America-for-any-reason europeans that
<BR>
get their entertainment from complaining about the supposed crimes of
<BR>
the US while never lifting a finger to do anything positive, or you were
<BR>
a bleeding heart that whines about human rights abuses but bitches when
<BR>
we go and fix it, or else you were acting as a Milosevic stooge. For
<BR>
that I apologize.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The treasure part includes property lost to terrorism and war as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; taxes paid to fund the current policy of military adventurism of the US.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; But also, the price will be paid in many other ways -- a less stable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; for one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As long as there are people who hate their neighbors just because they go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; different church or have a different accent, and are willing to kill them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; these differences, then the world will be less stable. Its did not start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; us, and cannot be blamed on us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The thing to do is not to add wood to the fire.  Add wood to the fire and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then one must accept some blame for the mess.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its kinda like containing forest fires. One useful technique is to start
<BR>
other fires in a controllable fashion that are in the path of the main
<BR>
fire that will cut off the fuel supply and exhaust the fire. People who
<BR>
complain about these sort of things are the sort of people who sit back
<BR>
and don't contribute, but feel quite free to criticize the results.
