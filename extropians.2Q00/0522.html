<EM>&gt;     You have told us something that needs to be told over and over not only 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the Standard Oil situation but about many others as well.  I have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lurked listening to this discussion and often wondered what would happen if 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bill Gates moved his headquarters and his jobs out of the US and into anyone 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a number of countries where he would be welcomed with open arms.

<P>Billyware is successful not because it's intrinsically good and worth
<BR>
much, but because his company is a steamroller -- for 20 years they've
<BR>
specialised in taking out competitors by dirty tricks, if they can't
<BR>
just buy them out.
<BR>
<P>In blindly worshipping success, you are worshipping at the altar of a 
<BR>
rogue company that has done more to _damage_ the free market than you can
<BR>
imagine.
<BR>
<P>The most important precondition that must apply before a market can
<BR>
function properly is that the market must be _fair_. That is, it is
<BR>
necessary for competitors to abide by contracts, obey market regulations
<BR>
(which should admittedly be as minimal as possible), and compete on
<BR>
the merits of their products. Microsoft doesn't do that, and in other
<BR>
lawsuits they've as good as admitted it. For example, they settled out
<BR>
of court in the Caldera lawsuit (see www.drdos.com for details) because
<BR>
Caldera had subpoena'd smoking-gun memos proving that Microsoft *hadn't*
<BR>
-- documents that demonstrated that Microsoft's first priority wasn't
<BR>
gaining market share by selling good products cheap, but putting the
<BR>
opposition out of business.
<BR>
<P>The DOJ Anti-trust lawsuit is a red herring, in my opinion. The accusations
<BR>
about it relying on 19th century law are true; and the remedies open to
<BR>
the judge are not promising. But Microsoft _is_ a threat to other players
<BR>
in the market, because Microsoft _doesn't_ play fair. 
<BR>
<P>There's nothing collectivist about hating Microsoft's behaviour, and
<BR>
nothing particularly individualist about defending it.
