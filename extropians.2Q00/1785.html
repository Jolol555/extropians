Previously in this thread:

<P>CRYONICS
<BR>
Spike Jones:
<BR>
Resuscitation from cryonic storage stage has
<BR>
no time limit that I know of, and the tech to freeze and store is with
<BR>
us already.
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
In principle, the time limit for storage in liquid nitrogen is virtually
<BR>
unlimited (meaning in the range of millions of years before quantum flux has
<BR>
any discernible effects). But I am not so sure that current suspension
<BR>
techniques provide adequate protection against cellular damage due to ice
<BR>
formation.
<BR>
<P>In response Robert J. Bradbury wrote:
<BR>
The limits on cryonic storage are much less than those discussed
<BR>
(quoted above).  Robert Freitas has done a paper on this and
<BR>
the draft version placed limits of 500-1000 years cryonic
<BR>
suspension before endoradiation would become a significant
<BR>
factor.  Currently the paper is being reworked to take into
<BR>
account radiation from the carbon in the histones, so those
<BR>
limits may be revised downward.  Counter to that is the
<BR>
possibility of syn-genome replacement based on the methods
<BR>
of genome fragment reassembly (pioneered by TIGR).
<BR>
<P>As I've stated before, and I'll state again, the limits on
<BR>
cryonic reanimation would appear to be fundamentally based
<BR>
on the question of whether or not the freezing process causes
<BR>
loss of positional information that could prevent 3D-reassembly.
<BR>
Given the size of synaptic and cellular structures, I strongly
<BR>
doubt that to be the case.  These are hundreds of thousands to
<BR>
tens-of-millions of atoms in size.  They are only going to match
<BR>
up in unique places.  Only if you unfreeze the brain and let it
<BR>
decay away into a molecular soup have you lost that information.
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
Thanks, Robert. I had not considered the fact that unstable isotopes within
<BR>
the frozen body would slowly damage surrounding cells. Is carbon-14 believed
<BR>
to be the main culprit?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding loss of positional information, you indicate that ice damage
<BR>
should not be an insurrmountable problem because of the small size of
<BR>
synaptic and cellular structures which should match up uniquely. But are
<BR>
these truly unique? Or are there merely very many permutations? Perhaps like
<BR>
snowflakes, there are huge numbers of different configurations, but there is
<BR>
still some duplication because of the still larger number of instances.
<BR>

Mike:
<BR>
Regarding a Tiplerian resurrection/emulation, Anders Sandberg has pointed
<BR>
out that, short of Tipler's Omega Point, a similar resurrection/emulation
<BR>
could be possible via AI superobjects (Jupiter/neutron star size/density AI
<BR>
brains) albeit for a less than universal coverage of the deceased. (How do
<BR>
we get on the resurrection/emulation waiting list? Maybe this Extropians
<BR>
list is IT!)At this point in time, I'd rate Anders' idea as the more likely
<BR>
of the two.
<BR>
<P>Mitch:
<BR>
Being a fav subject of mine, I would also suggest that the Jupiter Brain
<BR>
emmulation concept, conjectured by Roboticist, Hans Moravec is also in the
<BR>
works, as it utilizes
<BR>
a neutron star as the the source of computation. I believe the bit-stream
<BR>
for
<BR>
such a emmulation of the entire earth history is well bellow the estimated
<BR>
10^60 bits per second that a small neutron star is supposed to be capable
<BR>
of.
<BR>
&nbsp;Another extreme is the Max Tegmark Ensamble of Universes, and that deserves
<BR>
its own mailing list-which surprisingly there is.
<BR>
<P>Mike:
<BR>
Could you save me a few keystrokes amd give me the URL/subscription info for
<BR>
Max Tegmark and the list? Thanks.
