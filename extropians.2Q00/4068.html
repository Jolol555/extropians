<EM>&gt; &gt; Another company is caught spying on your PC.  RealNetworks installs a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Download Demon&quot; on your PC when you download their free players.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; records every download you make from the Internet and reports it back to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; RealNetwork for marketing purposes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Why do companies think they have the right to do this?  I am seeing more and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more of this!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>The above statement is ambiguous as to whether it means every file accessed
<BR>
through RealPlayer or every file accessed through browser or network stack.
<BR>
<P>If RealNetworks, or for that matter, browser manufacturer, enables amalgamation of
<BR>
posting habits then there is security concern.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; We each need to figure out how much information freedom we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comfortable with, do we not?  There are those on this list who feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that all information should be freeeee, so to them I say fine: freeeee
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your own first.  I have been toying with this notion myself, to go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ahead and open my own hard disks for anyone who cares to see,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; including financial records, tax records, medical, driving, scholastic,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; employment, everything and anything.  If I did that, then I would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfectly comfortable downloading free stuff.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seems like if they offered some free software and you took the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action to download it, whatever it wants to do is fair game.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>I will disagree with you on that, although you are perhaps being sarcastic.  What
<BR>
this kind of software is commonly called is a Trojan, referring to the Trojan
<BR>
Horse, in that it purports to be some kind of program when it has in fact a
<BR>
different, unadvertised, function that its users would normally not want and which
<BR>
might be damaging to them.
<BR>
<P>If this alleged software function is happening, then the perpetrator is guilty of
<BR>
stealing information from its users.
<BR>
<P>There is no functional RealPlayer on this system, it says, and I am quite sure
<BR>
never to have signed over rights to any kind of access to this system.
<BR>
<P>I browse RealPlayer web page and they have obtained one of those rubberstamp
<BR>
privacy seals.  The basis of those seals is that there is a posted privacy
<BR>
policy.  So, the prvacy policy might be &quot;this software installs a keystroke
<BR>
monitor and posts all data on the Internet for anyone&quot;, also, there is no
<BR>
enforcement.  Anyways, the privacy policies (there are several) posted there make
<BR>
no mention of tracking users' network activity completely unrelated to a streaming
<BR>
media solution.  There are some highly ambiguous statements in their posted
<BR>
policies, essentially giving a lot of leeway, depending on interpretation.
<BR>
Figuratively, of course, it's supposed to be some kind of protection of privacy,
<BR>
but literally it might be interpreted differently.
<BR>
<P>Regardless of an organization's privacy manifesto, if they steal information from
<BR>
you or otherwise take it without telling you, then you have been damaged.
<BR>
<P>Remember when Microsoft Win95 installation tried to post back information on all
<BR>
the third party software that was installed?  There were many issues with this.
<BR>
<P>So, then, how about this then, you keep your private information private, and if
<BR>
you want to try some free software it doesn't attempt to steal it from you.  That
<BR>
shouldn't be an issue, except for those who would.
<BR>
<P>It's kind of ugly to suggest to start filing class-action suits on behalf of
<BR>
anyone duped into running these Trojans, in lieu of legislated privacy
<BR>
protections.
<BR>
<P>This is one area where the United States is behind Europe, privacy laws.
