<EM>&gt; What is this &quot;closet tax&quot; you mention Mike? - I'm far from being an expert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on our tax laws, but I don't recall anyone from the Inland Revenue coming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; round to count the number of cupboards in my house.  Reminds me of an old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tax here based on the number of windows a house had - which inevitably led
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a large number of windows being bricked up. If there is a &quot;closet tax&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sticking a chair in each of them and calling them small lounges :)

<P>When I was in the Air Force, this was a widely commented upon thing for people
<BR>
who were stationed at Lakenheath or elsewhere on the Isle (not to mention the tv
<BR>
tax with the tv police). It seems as though houses are taxed on the number of
<BR>
rooms they have, and closets are counted as rooms, which is why wardrobes are
<BR>
such popular pieces of furniture over there (since if its furniture its not part
<BR>
of the building), while they never really caught on here. I don't know if its
<BR>
changed there since the 80's, but that was the gist of things.
<BR>
<P>Another thing they used to talk about was how stringent the vehicle inspection
<BR>
regs were over there. Billy-Bob normally couldn't drive his pickup truck over
<BR>
there, as little things like rust were much more frowned upon over there.
