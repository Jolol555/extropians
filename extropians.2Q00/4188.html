<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, since I'm such a fan of James H. Austin's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _Zen and the Brain_ I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would like to suggest it. It looks at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neuroscience of Zen, a quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; interesting synthesis attempt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have been slowly working my way through this book,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and would like to hear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more on what you got out of it.

<P>I read that book (*very* slowly) about a year ago and
<BR>
was amazed by how insightful it was.  There were parts
<BR>
that were sketchy as to their relation/significance
<BR>
but, Austen can hardly be blamed - he's got an
<BR>
pre-modern, mystical account on one hand, and a
<BR>
science in its developmental infancy in the other. 
<BR>
The dude deserves some kudos!  It struck me as a sort
<BR>
of techno-sutra in parts (but, that was probably
<BR>
intentional/unavoidable - quite enjoyable).
<BR>
&nbsp;**five minutes elapses**
<BR>
I've just pulled it off my shelf and am glancing
<BR>
through it.  I'd forgotten just how comprehensive the
<BR>
content is!  The discussion/explanation that could
<BR>
soooo easily degenerate into Dan-style pedagogy is
<BR>
strongly supported by a wealth of experimental data.
<BR>
Anyone who has a copy might glance over it again, give
<BR>
a page number, and suggest a topic...  ;-)
<BR>
His discussion of the altered states created by
<BR>
foreign substances (see &quot;The fleeting truths of
<BR>
nitrous oxide&quot;, p.407 in the '98 MIT paper edition -
<BR>
the first two sentences are the only reason I had my
<BR>
wisdom teeth removed  ;-)
<BR>
<P>Well, enough for now - I'm late - I think I'm becoming
<BR>
dependent on transhumanist thought.  
<BR>
<P>BEST,
<BR>
