<EM>&gt;&lt;&lt; Then, the free-wheeling discussions began to be taken over by organized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  intellectual purity squads - best exemplified by the &quot;New Libertarians&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  connected with Sam Konkin and his trigger man enforcer, Neil Shulmann.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  anyone said anything deviating from the official agorist line, they would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  instantly pounced upon and literally shouted down.  The LP similarly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rejected topics that were not oriented toward strictly political ends.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  now can see where this got us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Let's try to not repeat mistakes... &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sounds just like Ayn Rand in attitude (or the old soviet bolsheviki) who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a tendency to be Absolutist in action.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've noticed this in a wide variety of organizations of many 
<BR>
political/philosophical stripes.  When the agenda shifts from intellectual 
<BR>
inguiry to political success, the bludgies move in.  Sam's agorist crew got 
<BR>
a whole lot of things right - in my opinion - regarding the actual 
<BR>
anarchocapitalist theory.  Then they decided that if they just suppressed 
<BR>
the idiots/devils who disagreed with them, the revolution would be 
<BR>
immediately upon us.
<BR>
<P>They also tried this in science fiction fandom, with truly disasterous 
<BR>
results.  FANs were by and large mostly libertarians to begin with, with 
<BR>
many strongly libertarian authors and novels to draw upon.  Sam's crew would 
<BR>
attend some seminar at an SF con and start harrangueing the speaker, 
<BR>
interrupting them and refusing to shut up or let them continue....  For a 
<BR>
while, even mentioning you were a libertarian could get you excluded from 
<BR>
parties.
