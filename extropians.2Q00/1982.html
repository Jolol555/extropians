The Sunday Times, 30.04.2000
<BR>
<P>MI5 builds new centre to read e-mails on the net 
<BR>
(Nicholas Rufford )
<BR>
<P>MI5 is building a new £25m e-mail surveillance centre that will 
<BR>
have the power to monitor all e-mails and internet messages sent 
<BR>
and received in Britain. The government is to require internet 
<BR>
service providers, such as Freeserve and AOL, to have &quot;hardwire&quot; 
<BR>
links to the new computer facility so that messages can be traced 
<BR>
across the internet. 
<BR>
The security service and the police will still need Home Office 
<BR>
permission to search for e-mails and internet traffic, but they can 
<BR>
apply for general warrants that would enable them to intercept 
<BR>
communications for a company or an organisation. 
<BR>
The new computer centre, codenamed GTAC - government 
<BR>
technical assistance centre - which will be up and running by the 
<BR>
end of the year inside MI5's London headquarters, has provoked 
<BR>
concern among civil liberties groups. &quot;With this facility, the 
<BR>
government can track every website that a person visits, without a 
<BR>
warrant, giving rise to a culture of suspicion by association,&quot; said 
<BR>
Caspar Bowden, director of the Foundation for Information Policy 
<BR>
Research. 
<BR>
The government already has powers to tap phone lines linking 
<BR>
computers, but the growth of the internet has made it impossible 
<BR>
to read all material. By requiring service providers to install cables 
<BR>
that will download material to MI5, the government will have the 
<BR>
technical capability to read everything that passes over the internet. 
<BR>
Home Office officials say the centre is needed to tackle the use of 
<BR>
the internet and mobile phone networks by terrorists and 
<BR>
international crime gangs.Charles Clark, the minister in charge of 
<BR>
the spy centre project, said it would allow police to keep pace with 
<BR>
technology. 
<BR>
&quot;Hardly anyone was using the internet or mobile phones 15 years 
<BR>
ago,&quot; a Home Office source said. &quot;Now criminals can 
<BR>
communicate with each other by a huge array of devices and 
<BR>
channels and can encrypt their messages, putting them b
<BR>
&nbsp;conventional eavesdropping.&quot; 
<BR>
There has been an explosion in the use of the internet for crime in 
<BR>
Britain and across the world, leading to fears in western 
<BR>
intelligence agencies that they will soon be left behind as 
<BR>
criminals abandon the telephone and resort to encrypted e-mails 
<BR>
to run drug rings and illegal prostitution and immigration rackets. 
<BR>
The new spy centre will decode messages that have been 
<BR>
encrypted. Under new powers due to come into force this summer, 
<BR>
police will be able to require individuals and companies to hand 
<BR>
over computer &quot;keys&quot;, special codes that unlock scrambled 
<BR>
messages. 
<BR>
There is controversy over how the costs of intercepting internet 
<BR>
traffic should be shared between government and industry. 
<BR>
Experts estimate that the cost to Britain's 400 service providers will 
<BR>
be £30m in the first year. Internet companies say that this is too 
<BR>
expensive, especially as many are making losses. 
<BR>
About 15m people in Britain have internet access. Legal experts 
<BR>
have warned that many are unguarded in the messages they send 
<BR>
or the material they download, believing that they are safe from 
<BR>
prying eyes. 
<BR>
&quot;The arrival of this spy centre means that Big Brother is finally 
<BR>
here,&quot; said Norman Baker, Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes. &quot;The 
<BR>
balance between the state and individual privacy has swung too 
<BR>
far in favour of the state.&quot;
