<EM>&gt; &gt; With sufficient monitoring capacity we would know the *day* anyone

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With sufficient monitoring capacity, any information gathering is possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in principle.  So this last statement is too broad to be very useful.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, I was primarily using space-based observers as lookouts for
<BR>
accidental releases or mutations.  These are primarily point source
<BR>
so orbiting satellites viewing locations once every few hours to
<BR>
few days would see the development in time to allow deployment
<BR>
(or even active defense if you allow large space-based lasers).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But if we are talking about early or intermediate nanotech, and our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monitoring is restricted to detecting temperature anomalies, I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think this is effective against some of Robert Freitas' scenarios.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, as I suggested to Robert, but he chose not to include in the
<BR>
paper you can also to high throughput air &amp; water monitoring using
<BR>
a distributed network of briefcase sized distribted mass-spec machines.
<BR>
These would be placed around the globe and linked to satellites (similar
<BR>
to the seismometer networks currently in use to monitor nuclear
<BR>
tests).  Nanobot activities would distort not only local
<BR>
temperatures but local atmospheric or water concentrations as well.
<BR>
Because they are widely placed and could be interlinked with an
<BR>
understanding of insolation, wind patterns, etc. they should be
<BR>
able to detect changes in thermal activities well below the 4 degree
<BR>
threshold Robert uses.
<BR>
<P>The nanobots would have to be designed *very* carefully
<BR>
to avoid tipping their hand that they are converting the biomass
<BR>
into nanomass.  (Likely byproducts of that process include things
<BR>
like N2, NO, NO2, etc.).  So replicants would have to keep the
<BR>
production of these materials below natural concentration variations.
<BR>
<P>It is useful to note that we are rapidly moving in the direction of
<BR>
having such monitoring capabilities in place for the purposes of
<BR>
tracking global warming, extraterratorial pollution, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Assume that the goo seeds are spread widely before beginning their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; growth phase.  Robert F. suggests dispersal by airplane.  Perhaps it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would work to spread rock-coated nanites in the form of dust released
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the atmosphere from a few locations over a period of many months.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We now have potentially billions or even trillions of nucleation sites.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, so here you are talking about an intentionally designed terrorist
<BR>
weapon using &quot;advanced&quot; nanotech.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Each of these begins to grow simultaneously, not caring about local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thermal pollution, but limited by some constraining temperature, such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as the boiling point of water.  (We cook our food before eating it;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps the goo will find it more tender that way as well.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I dealt with this as well in my comments to Robert.  You simply *do not*
<BR>
have the resources around the globe (energy or matter) to have uniform
<BR>
growth rates.  Not enough biomass in deserts, arctic regions or under
<BR>
the ocean.  Probably not enough energy in arctic regions or the ocean
<BR>
as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to Robert F.'s figures, this will not cause a noticeable (4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; degree) global increase in temperatures until something like 0.0001%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of total biomass has been converted.  Due to the wide dispersal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; localized hot spots may not be detectable either.  At this point the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; global temperature will rapidly increase to 100 degrees C.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, only in regions where the energy and material resources are
<BR>
sufficiently dense will they be able to grow at the most rapid rates.
<BR>
There are huge regions of the planet where they will have a difficult
<BR>
time replicating at all.  So you get local hot spots that can be
<BR>
detected and eradicated from space or using ground based weapons.
<BR>
The standard precaution against this would be to have defense systems
<BR>
in places where biomass consuming nanobots cannot grow.
<BR>
<P>If there is a plausible defense installed, then the construction of
<BR>
such nasty machines and their distribution would be rather pointless.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At this point the growth rate ramps down and the remaining conversion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; takes three weeks so we don't burn our food.  Of course by this time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the temperature has killed all life anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, if your goal is the destruction of life on the planet then this
<BR>
would be a good way to accomplish it except for the reasons I've cited
<BR>
above.  However, the probability that individuals who are that irrational
<BR>
would have the resources to develop the advanced nanotech and delivery
<BR>
systems required to produce the scenario you describe seems very low
<BR>
to me.  Their resources would certainly be far less than the resources
<BR>
of the groups developing the monitoring and defense systems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't see how particle beams and similar technologies can deal with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an attack of this sort.  The goo sites are too numerous and widespread,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the time from thermal detection to total destruction of the biosphere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is too short.
</EM><BR>
<P>You do standard fire outbreak containment tactics.  You dump a line of
<BR>
radioactive waste if they are coming across the ground.  You go underground
<BR>
or underwater if they are airborne.  As a last resort you simply nuke em.
<BR>
With the type of advanced nanotech you are discussing we can rebuild
<BR>
the planet in a matter of days, so if you have to level it to start
<BR>
over with a more rational group of people, so be it.
<BR>
<P>Of course the trick is to be members of the groups in space or in the
<BR>
bunkers if and when those difficult choices have to be made.
<BR>
<P>Robert's paper does not deal with what the responses should be to such
<BR>
outbreaks.  It simply says that we can detect them and do something
<BR>
if we are prepared.  Being unprepared is kind of like imagining
<BR>
medicine without stockpiles of antibiotics.  -- &quot;Oh, yes, we know
<BR>
how to make them, but we didn't want to spend the money to stockpile
<BR>
them because disease outbreaks happen so infrequently.&quot; -- Any
<BR>
prudent person would recognize this as a bad idea.
