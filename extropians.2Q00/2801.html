<P><EM>&gt; ...you know nothing about history and the way people with power operate.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with much of what you have written.  The solution is not
<BR>
necessarily to stop society from become ever more transparent [which
<BR>
is like holding back the tide from coming up the beach] but rather to
<BR>
change the way people with power operate.  Such as, arranging
<BR>
government so that there are fewer people, less power.  With
<BR>
sufficient surveillance, every act of people with power is open
<BR>
to public scrutiny.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The entire 'war on drugs' can be seen largely as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a way for government to expand power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while ignoring constitutional limitations on their actions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right!  So its time to end that war.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Property seizures/asset forfeitures aren't constitutional, and yet they exist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because people can be scared into allowing it to happen.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right!  People must not be scared into allowing that to happen.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Giving people who've shown a fairly consistent record of being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; untrustworthy more power is insane.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right again Mike!  I couldnt agree more.  Those who are
<BR>
untrustworthy with power must come under ever more scrutiny.
<BR>
Anyone who runs for public office must be watched constantly,
<BR>
every move, every word, every deed.  Cameras dont blink.
<BR>
<P>The existence or even *possible* existence of tiny cheap
<BR>
surveillance devices should make the populace ever more
<BR>
wary of increasing the government's power in any way.
<BR>
The cameras should then be the libertarians friend.  spike
