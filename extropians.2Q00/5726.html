<EM>&gt; &gt;The Chinese never really used gunpowder as more than a curiousity, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they never invented anything that could properly be considered a gun in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;any conventional sense.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No guns, but they did have cannon, which were a critical part of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ming military system against steppe nomads.  It's certainly true they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did far less with it than the Europeans did.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The original Chinese cannons were of limited capability due to the
<BR>
limitations of their materials and fabrication methods.  While they were
<BR>
used effectively against soft targets, such as the steppe nomads, they
<BR>
were too weak to be effectively used against harder targets.  The bores
<BR>
were quite weak and generally not very reliable.  This was also the reason
<BR>
the Chinese were not able to produce musket-type personal weapons.
<BR>
<P>The europeans on the other hand, used their superior metal technologies
<BR>
and rapidly produced very strong and functional designs (such as the every
<BR>
popular cast bronze bore) that were actually capable of the rock-shattering
<BR>
capability usually associated with cannons.  The Europeans quickly drove
<BR>
the technology to the point where it was well-suited to a much broader
<BR>
set of military roles, such as breaching hardened fortresses.  The vastly
<BR>
superior european cannons were introduced in China in the 16th and
<BR>
17th century by the Jesuits.
