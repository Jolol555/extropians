<P><EM>&gt;&gt; There seems to be a cultural assumption

<EM>&gt;&gt; bunch of baddies, and all that is necessary is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to identify the good guys and side with them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; This is one struggle where the bad guys are

<EM>&gt;&gt; distributed evenly on all sides -- if you want

<EM>&gt;&gt; to root for someone, root for the peace process

<EM>&gt;&gt; and the politicians sitting around the

<P><EM>&gt; Poking my nose in quickly . . . but I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Charlie's dead right.  I've spent a lot of time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the UK (but none in Ireland) and am a pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energetic proponent of the &quot;anglosphere&quot; concept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as proposed by Jim Bennett of Foresight in his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upcoming book &quot;The Network Commonwealth&quot;.  I see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ireland and England as both part of a common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cultural sphere with more in common with each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other than they have with most other cultures.

<P>Hi Greg. I think you're absolutely right about the cultural
<BR>
similarities between England and Ireland (and also between the
<BR>
UK as a whole, and Ireland).
<BR>
<P>But the relevance of this to any contemporary political,
<BR>
economic, or cultural questions is difficult to assess. This is
<BR>
because the similarity was brought about by an extermination of
<BR>
most of Irish culture. Republicans want to bring much of that
<BR>
culture back. Singing the praises of its absence might not be a
<BR>
sound political strategy (not that that was your intention).
<BR>
<P>Still, as things stand now, there's no question that Ireland and
<BR>
the UK have much to gain by working together on as many fronts
<BR>
as possible. Let's hope they do so.
<BR>
<P><P>&lt;&gt; A few random points re the Northern Ireland thread.

<EM>&gt; fighters struggling against the evil oppression
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the British (English) Empire. They are not.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are several IRA groups. Each is different, each has
<BR>
changed greatly over the last several decades. They've been
<BR>
noble, they've been ignoble.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They (and the UVF) are just drug runners and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pimps with an extremely brutal streak that use

<P>Not &quot;just.&quot; Plenty of them, though, yes. Armies that aren't

sponsored officially by a government almost always end up
<BR>
resorting to sleaze to fund themselves. &quot;The end justifies the

<BR>
<EM>&gt; Drug running is a typical fund raising schema
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for marxists [....]
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, for ALL non-state-sponsored armies. I'm with you on
<BR>
the anti-Marxism, but let's not be ideological: the facts alone
<BR>
suffice, here.
