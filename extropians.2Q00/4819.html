<P><EM>&gt; Seems to me what you want is &quot;infinite improvement&quot;.  I think this fully 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  expresses the most extropian of hopes and, hey, who could argue with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  improvement?
</EM><BR>
<P>Improvement alone is not what I meant, but maybe it's what Max was thinking. 
<BR>
Improvement implies that there's alwyas something that needs fixing ( though 
<BR>
certainly there are things we can correct, we also have lots we like and want 
<BR>
to continue, just MORE of it. I think 'expression&quot; considers the attitude 
<BR>
that we are changing and flexing, without inherently implying we have to 
<BR>
correct something.
