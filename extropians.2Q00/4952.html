<EM>&gt; &gt; And in a regulated market there are lots of things regulators will not let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  buy or do, and unlike Microsoft the ultimate consequence of not doing what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the government tell you to do is physical force, however much that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  for obedience, up to and including death. They will shoot you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can you site soem examples of people getting shot for not using a product the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government has regulated?
</EM><BR>
<P>Since all government services are regulated, refusing to pay taxes that pay for
<BR>
those government services has gotten plenty of people shot. Also, what
<BR>
particular government are you talking about? The US government?
<BR>
<P>There are literally dozens of cases where law abiding, non-drug using
<BR>
individuals have been shot in their homes by DEA hit squads because an informant
<BR>
fabricated the address of his 'supplier'. Since drugs are regulated, then that
<BR>
does fit your query.
<BR>
<P>Then there are all the people who have been shot by the government for using
<BR>
regulated products without paying the taxes on them. Ruby Ridge and Waco were
<BR>
both instigated by the government over the non-payment of a $5.00 tax. Three
<BR>
people were shot at Ruby Ridge and 80+ people shot and burned to death at Waco
<BR>
over a $5.00 tax on a regulated product.
