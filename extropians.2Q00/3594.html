<EM>&gt; &gt; I was ambiguous. What I think I meant is that the specifics in terms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the percentile figures for taxation are not much use with no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consideration of how that money is being used (which can be well or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; badly, as you say).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Once you've decided to allow for some taxation, however (as opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; none at all, as Mike has suggested - and it is a vaild option) it makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; very little sense to try and compare exactly how much freedom a country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has removed, via its taxes. There are simply far too many factors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree.  I think there are plenty of examples of what constitutes a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonable upper bound for how much money a government should spend for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given service.  Even assuming that taxation does not equal theft if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; valuable services are received, any taxation above the demonstrable market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rate for a given type of service *is* theft by any definition I can think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is where the argument really begins.  In the vast majority of cases,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government services are *grossly* overpriced.  If government services were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as efficient and responsive as people claim they can be, privatization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't be as attractive as it is.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Looking at the &quot;best practices&quot; of various governments around the U.S.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and combining them, I estimate that I could get a level of service as good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or better than I currently receive for no more than 5% of my income, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably a bit less.  However, in practice the government charges me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greater than an order of magnitude over a reasonable market rate.  Not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only that, but the government has no motivation to become more efficient. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would be happy with direct tax provided services *if* they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comparable to what private industry could provide.  Unfortunately, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult to devise a way to do this that doesn't eventually slip into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inefficiency.  That efficient taxing agencies exist today is more of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accident than a stable long-term outcome.
</EM><BR>
<P>But this is exactly the point - without taking into consideration how
<BR>
well the money is being spent, trying to compare how much theft is going
<BR>
on in in two countries by their tax rates is  
<BR>
<P>Do take me in context - I was discussing with Mike the specific
<BR>
differences between the US and the UK. And as Charlie pointed out with
<BR>
figures, there's actually very little in it.
<BR>
<P>Which considering how much social security and healthcare our nasty evil
<BR>
socialist system is paying for would possibly indicate better spending
<BR>
of money.
<BR>
<P>And personally, I'd be quite happy to pay some more, in order to improve
<BR>
things (specifically, better pay for nurses and other public service
<BR>
workers - and *especially* teachers).
