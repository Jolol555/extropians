<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Maybe you can look at welfare this way:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Givens:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- There is always going to be a segment of the population which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;dead weight&quot;, ie not able to support itself. This seems a fairly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reasonable given to me, but if you don't agree, speak up!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- Those unable to support themselves can either be supported by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;someone else, or must turn to the black economy (and crime). (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;die I guess, but not too many are going for this one out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;choice).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- Crime costs more than the welfare bill. (is this true?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your premises are not acceptable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Premise 1) Individuals must support themselves and their progeny by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legal means or find someone willing to support them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yet individuals will do this. This is the difference between the formal
<BR>
social rules and the real social rules.
<BR>
For many people in circumstances of very low social buy in, the local
<BR>
optimum action will be criminal behaviour.
<BR>
The only reason that they should not pursue such action is an externally
<BR>
imposed set of rules/moral values, by
<BR>
the powerful upon the powerless. Big nasty govt?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Now the libertarian objects to paying tax for welfare. But surely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the agregate level of crime inflicted per person must be at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as invasive of rights as welfare.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Individuals or groups of such do not have the right to engage in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illegal activities to support themselves. (premise 1)
</EM><BR>
<P>They may not have the formal right, but they have the power. See above.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So the most violating of &quot;good&quot; citizens (hee hee) rights is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;crime, followed by paying tax for welfare. Maybe the unsupported
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;citizen should be identified and &quot;terminated&quot; (ouch), but by whom?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;How do you seperate such a person (known as &quot;dole bludgers&quot; in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;local rags), from those who are temporarily down on their luck,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but truly trying to &quot;do the right thing&quot; (ooh I'm feeling all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;protestant all of a sudden).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can start by asking them, or you can insist upon an answer if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are caught in an illegal activity. You may help them yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or refer them to social services.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I would content that the same answers would come from people in either camp,
<BR>
if in fact the division between &quot;dole bludger&quot; and &quot;down on luck&quot; types
<BR>
actually represents
<BR>
reality, which I suspect it does not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;The point is, you can't make such a decision. Welfare is the least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;detrimental of all available options to each individual's rights,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and thus should be decided upon from an individualist point of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is consistant with your premise, but your premise is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unacceptable (at least to me) and therefore your conclusion is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invalid. I've always thought that along with the Bill Of Rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there should have been a Bill Of Duties. One of those would be that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you have a duty to be self supporting, and not an unfair burden on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your society.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that rights and duties must coexist. Power &amp; responsibility must
<BR>
travel in pairs.
<BR>
The problem is, being self supporting  means being self supporting all the
<BR>
time. If all of us
<BR>
were to be left to starve the first time we became non-self supporting, not
<BR>
too many of us
<BR>
would be reaching old age!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There's been some comment about not letting those who can't afford
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to have babies to do so. Maybe you guys in the US don't have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;aging population problem that we do in Australia. Over here,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;people say the same things...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    - We don't want No Stinkin Welfare mums (&quot;moms&quot; in American),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    - We don't want No Stinkin immigration,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    - We don't got no Stinkin Workers to support the baby boomers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in retirement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not saying they can't have them, I'm saying they shouldn't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them. If they do have children, they are responsible for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; welfare of these children.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>... and in time, these children are responsible for the welfare of the
<BR>
society at large as
<BR>
potential workers, and so the welfare of the aged (at least those
<BR>
unable/unwilling to
<BR>
work). Eventually, these people benefit those who have not participating in
<BR>
paying their
<BR>
&quot;cost of development&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It's a no brainer. Having kids is not a luxury in the west, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a necessity, from a social viewpoint. That, or increased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;immigration of younguns (those third-world types still know how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;its done!). Australia rewards the DINKS (double income no kids)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for their hassle free lifestyle by not requiring them to have any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;responsibility for raising the next generation, apart from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;throwing the same few sheckles to the govt that the parents have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to throw. It's crazy really; we all need the coming generations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but damned if anyone is willing to pay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The people who feel they are necessary and actually have children
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are the ones who should pay the costs involved.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is like saying that those who think roads are necessary should build
<BR>
them,
<BR>
or those who think education is necessary should build the institutions.
<BR>
Maybe this
<BR>
is libertarian thinking after all? The market will provide, and all that
<BR>
stuff. Is this
<BR>
truly what libertarians are peddling?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Oddly enough, many of the same people who don't want to foot this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;bill seem to be those who aren't too interested in immigrants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;White people are going to turn up in history books (databases,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;yeah yeah) as curiosities; stomped all over the globe, made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;everyone else's lives hell, then just when they looked like a real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;problem, they just stopped procreating. Couldn't be bothered.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't have any problems with legal immigrants.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mostly people don't. Are we going to be able to cope with seriously
<BR>
increasing the number
<BR>
of legal immigrants?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Maybe instead of getting cranky with those poor people who breed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;all over the place, we could educate their kids. For purely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;selfish reasons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Children are perhaps the single most precious resource of all. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I still think their parents are primarily responsible and should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pay the considerable costs involved, and I do not think those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot afford them should have them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>If all births were planned, we'd be extinct (that's not mine, obviously).
<BR>
What would western population
<BR>
demographics look like if only those who could &quot;afford&quot; kids had them?
<BR>
Disastrous! And, our countries
<BR>
would be sad places containing only the aging, the kind of mockery of human
<BR>
existence that seems to
<BR>
stem again and again from economic rationalist dogma.
<BR>
<P>Umm, too emotive and unsupportable. Sorry about that. Let me try again.
<BR>
<P>If children are the single most precious resource of all, why are they
<BR>
primarily the responsibility of parents,
<BR>
when the benefit seems to flow to everyone; that it flows more to the
<BR>
parents than to other members of
<BR>
society would be a hard premise to support.
<BR>
<P>How about this: Many people with the bucks wont have kids because they are
<BR>
too busy doing whatever it is that
<BR>
earns the bucks. Others have kids without the bucks because, well, what else
<BR>
are they doing? So really, these
<BR>
second group are not a burden, they are actually providing social benefit,
<BR>
which the first group are free riding on.
