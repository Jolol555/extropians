<P>
I have really enjoyed the threads about living below one's means, finding 
<BR>
one's real priorities and not being totally swept up in consumerism.
<BR>
<P>I really loved reading Bonnie's introduction about herself.  She is right 
<BR>
out of the pages of _Mother Earth News_!!  That she could give up her 
<BR>
high-consumption lifestyle and make a big U-turn in her life is amazing.  I 
<BR>
feel fortunate to have her on the list.  A formal welcome to you. :)
<BR>
<P>she wrote:
<BR>
Six years ago I took up a forager/low-key horticultural lifestyle so that I 
<BR>
could study, read, and write what I was interested in without having to 
<BR>
worry about making more than enough money to buy a few toys I occasionally 
<BR>
want, like computer equipment, photovoltaics. I live in a house I built from 
<BR>
homemade adobe bricks. I've had great fun devising a water-delivery system, 
<BR>
electrical system, and so forth. I find the lifestyle to be quite 
<BR>
pleasant,and the garden, woods, and fields themselves are endless sources of 
<BR>
wonder(as are city streets, alleys, and vacant lots, for that matter). I 
<BR>
learn at least 5 or 6 new things each day in the garden and many more from 
<BR>
reading.  From the latest neurological research I've read, this constant 
<BR>
exposure to new ideas should keep my mind agile into my old age. Most 
<BR>
important as far as I'm concerned, I'm eager to get up and start each day, 
<BR>
and I sleep well at night, and eat very well indeed.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Bonnie BUILT her own place from homemade adobe bricks and figured out things 
<BR>
like water and power as she went along!  This is a pretty cool lady.  
<BR>
Bonnie, I have a feeling that if you make it to the singularity you will end 
<BR>
up being a pioneer on Mars or some other exotic location. :)
<BR>
<P>Bonnie continued:
<BR>
She was one of those generally referred to as &quot;homeless&quot; although I don't 
<BR>
think she would have characterized herself in that way. She'd found some 
<BR>
pieces of lumber and sheet metal and built a shelter in a vacant city lot; 
<BR>
she'd planted a little vegetable garden there next to her shelter. She told 
<BR>
me that the night before she'd found some lobster and shrimp in a grocery 
<BR>
store dumpster and had invited a bunch of homeless people to share in her 
<BR>
bounty. &quot;I have so much,&quot; she told me, &quot;I feel as though I should share.&quot;
<BR>
<P>It occurred to me that overall, Donna's quality of life was higher than 
<BR>
mine, although she was jobless and I enjoyed a position in one of the more 
<BR>
highly paid professions. Her days were her own; she lived by her own clock 
<BR>
and didn't feel constantly rushed by this or that deadline; and she felt 
<BR>
herself wealthy enough to indulge in charity. I'm forever grateful to this 
<BR>
woman, whom I never saw again after that day.  Meeting Donna didn't move me 
<BR>
to take up a life on the streets, but I began to give my thoughts a much 
<BR>
wider scope in imagining possible futures for myself.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I found this a touching story but had some reservations about it.  I found 
<BR>
your friend Donna to be very resourceful in building a shelter and planting 
<BR>
a garden, but by squatting on public property she could easily be kicked out 
<BR>
and see her efforts all be bulldozed away.  Being homeless she is at far 
<BR>
greater risk to be robbed or raped.  And if she gets sick she will get 
<BR>
substandard medical care, if any.  After all, you only knew her a short time 
<BR>
and don't know what became of her.  I hope she is alright.
<BR>
<P>she continues:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From my own experience and from what I've read, I've concluded that cutting 
</EM><BR>
down on stress is one of the most life-prolonging things a person can do.  
<BR>
There's no doubt that abject poverty is stressful, but for many people 
<BR>
there's a far distance between their present level of income and abject 
<BR>
poverty.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I agree that chronic exposure to high-levels of negative stress can be very 
<BR>
harmful.  A prime example being when a person is stressed by a career or job 
<BR>
that drains them without getting a lot of positives from it.
<BR>
<P>Abject poverty is indeed very stressful and individuals and families plagued 
<BR>
by it often age and die years before their time.  I'm sure poor nutrition 
<BR>
must play a big part.  I think the causes go beyond simply not having access 
<BR>
to good medical care.

<BR>
No offense, but from my point of view this comes across as something more 
<BR>
likely to be heard from a commune-dweller in the 60s rather than an 
<BR>
extropian. Committing to a lifestyle that you describe could put you at a 
<BR>
big disadvantage when it comes to having access to new technologies.
<BR>
<P>For instance, in the future you might not be able to afford some cutting 
<BR>
edge medical tech that could extend your lifespan.  And again no offense, 
<BR>
but spending your days tending your garden is not exactly helping you get 
<BR>
closer to the days of posthumanism. For the individuals advocating or living 
<BR>
such a &quot;static&quot; non-expanding lifestyle, I would like you to go over to 
<BR>
extropy.org and re-read the principles.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I admit that if Bonnie is living on under ten-thousand a year that she is 
<BR>
financially limited.  Then again, I work full-time in a large retailer and 
<BR>
not much more then that! LOL  My problem is having not gotten my education 
<BR>
when I should have.  I hope to go back to school, get a degree and then get 
<BR>
a decent paying job.
<BR>
<P>I agree with Brian that by being *poor&quot; she is in a vulnerable position if 
<BR>
her health goes bad or if a powerful but expensive rejuvenation treatment is 
<BR>
perfected.  She may not be able to simply shift gears and become once again 
<BR>
a high-powered lawyer. I just hope she has or soon gets a cryonics policy.  
<BR>
Bonnie is old enough that it would be a good idea.
<BR>
<P>I just don't think her simple and close to the earth lifestyle is 
<BR>
anti-extropian.  Do all extropians have to be an engineer, programmer, 
<BR>
scientist or other type of professional who makes $60,000 plus a year? lol!

<BR>
I wonder if extropians have resistance to consumerist memes, if only because 
<BR>
we pay attention to information sources other than consumerist media?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>A good question.  I would think we would have a great deal of vulnerability 
<BR>
to Madison Avenue's mass marketing machine also.  Based on what I read on 
<BR>
the list, there is a strong love here (among at least many list members) for 
<BR>
the material bounty of this world(myself included).  I think that is why 
<BR>
nanotech is seen as SO appealing to us all! :)

You're post describing yourself seemed to describe me exactly. I've got my 
<BR>
stereo speakers, cars, house(only this with a little remaining to pay 
<BR>
of).... many years ago, who needs new ones? Even my home computer is still 
<BR>
an old upgraded P5/90. If the stock market keeps going up, I'll be able to 
<BR>
pay cash for my cryonics membership in about 10 years or less. That, 
<BR>
retirement as soon as possible, and leaving funds for my kids so they can 
<BR>
continue the growth, hopefully by them also living within their means, is by 
<BR>
far my biggest goal. Like you, I hate &quot;stuff&quot;. I guess expensive food is my 
<BR>
weakness, largely because it doesn't collect.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Brent, it sounds like you have your financial house in order.  I wish I 
<BR>
could say I hated stuff, more like I resent it! lol  I am a packrat by 
<BR>
nature and have tons of old magazines, comics, videotapes, computers, 
<BR>
papers, books and miscellaneous items that I just can't bear to part with. 
<BR>
lol  It could be scary if I actually had serious money to spend...

Saving is definitely good, can't deny that. However I wouldn't focus all 
<BR>
your efforts onto that route of achieving millionaire status, since it may 
<BR>
take you so long to achieve it that way that the singularity will  be here 
<BR>
first. On the other hand there is no guarantee a singularity will occur.
<BR>
<P>I think everyone should take at least one shot at the &quot;join a hot startup 
<BR>
and get rich quick&quot; route to millionaire status. You may fail, in which case 
<BR>
you can fall back onto the careful saving/investing approach, but then again 
<BR>
it might work out quite well, leaving you enough cash to help use for other 
<BR>
extropian/singularitarian purposes.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>If only the person knows which startup to join AND if they have the right 
<BR>
skills to offer them.  I wish Max More, Mike Lorrey and others here good 
<BR>
luck in their efforts in this area.  They just may have the insight and 
<BR>
knowledge to do it.
<BR>
<P>I realize that education, hard work and career are the best way to acquiring 
<BR>
a good living and making one's way in the world.  But still, on the side I 
<BR>
like to enter contents and sweepstakes, because I MIGHT (one in a many 
<BR>
million chance) just win.
<BR>
<P>I learned from a newsletter I get that the publisher of Silhouette romances 
<BR>
was having a seven million dollar grand prize sweepstakes.  I mailed five 
<BR>
entries a day for almost three months.  Sadly, I didn't win despite my 
<BR>
effort! lol  But had I won the effort would have seemed worth it.
<BR>
<P>Now I often go for the smaller and less exciting contests.  I did win a 
<BR>
prize once, not the automobile grand prize but a tote bag built with the 
<BR>
quality of a potato sack that on the side advertised for Marlboro 
<BR>
cigarettes!

<BR>
I recently finished Thomas Stanley's &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot; and &quot;The 
<BR>
Millionaire Mind&quot;. Both books deal with his extensive research on 
<BR>
millionaires, who they are and how they got there. His main point is that 
<BR>
the vast majority got there in this lifetime, on their own. They stay 
<BR>
married to the same person for life, and they are very pragmatic about 
<BR>
spending money. They are not at all what we have come to expect via the 
<BR>
media.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>These are great books that I have read large portions of while on my breaks 
<BR>
at work! lol  I need to break down and buy them.  They tend to stay married 
<BR>
to the same person for life?  They sure do beat the statistics in more ways 
<BR>
then one!!  The books indicated that these people were not always highly 
<BR>
intelligent or educated(many were of course) but that they were risk takers 
<BR>
who enjoyed being in charge of their own enterprise rather then working for 
<BR>
someone else.  And they got a great amount of work satisfaction which 
<BR>
usually had a strong spiritual connection of some sort.  These were 
<BR>
generally not the people that Robin Leach would show you on &quot;Lifestyles of 
<BR>
the Rich and Famous.&quot; lol
<BR>
<P>Interestingly, they often counselled their children to not try to follow in 
<BR>
their footsteps unless they really were compelled to do so.  They encouraged 
<BR>
their offspring to get professional degrees with solid income making 
<BR>
potential.  Some of these adult children picked up at least some of the 
<BR>
positive traits of their parents in terms of saving, building wealth and not 
<BR>
being ravenous consumers while others definitely did not.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, these threads have been interesting food for thought.  Somehow in 
<BR>
discussions like these, I think of the Madonna song, &quot;Material Girl.&quot; :)  
<BR>
There are plenty of material boys out there too, of course.  I have learned 
<BR>
from painful personal experience the importance of being able to do well in 
<BR>
our material society so one can gain the mate, children and lifestyle they 
<BR>
wish for.  I have not done that yet.
<BR>
<P>Of course what we are talking about here is the idea of at least partially 
<BR>
getting off the treadmill of out of control consumerism.  &quot;Do you own your 
<BR>
possessions or do they own you?&quot; is my final thought.
<BR>
