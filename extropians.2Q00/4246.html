<EM>&gt; Well this is what I am getting at: in these &quot;paradoxes&quot; that I keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hearing about, and that you describe above, all that is really going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on is that someone may have quicker knowledge (i.e. see an event happen)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before someone else who is relying on normal light (travelling at normal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lightspeed) to see the event. But the event already happened long ago.
</EM><BR>
<P>One of my favorite frame-of-reference paradoxes:
<BR>
<P>Imagine there's a 20 meter tunnel with steel doors at each end and I'm
<BR>
running through it at nearly the speed of light carrying a 20 meter
<BR>
pole. When I'm halfway through, both doors snap shut at exactly the
<BR>
same moment. Does the pole get cut or not? Surely the answer must be
<BR>
the same in all reference frames.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From my perspective, the pole is stationary. I observe its rest-length of
</EM><BR>
20 meters. The tunnel however is moving very quickly, so it looks much
<BR>
shorter than 20 meters. The tunnel is shorter than my pole, and therefore
<BR>
the pole must be cut.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the perspective of an observer stationary relative to the tunnel,
</EM><BR>
however, my pole has shrunk to something shorter than the tunnel - to
<BR>
something as close to zero as you like, depending on my speed - so
<BR>
when I'm halfway along both doors can close comfortably. Therefore,
<BR>
the pole doesn't get cut.
<BR>
<P>(The resolution is that I can't say 'both doors close at the same time'
<BR>
without specifying an observer.)
