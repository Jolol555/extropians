<EM>&gt; &gt;Let's start with how our victim became a &quot;poor, uneducated, unconnected,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;single welfare mom&quot; in the first place.  Give credit where credit is due.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The social bandaids are created by well-meaning socialists such as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Democrats.  Unfortunately, they are being used to cover up a sucking chest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;wound largely created by the very same well-meaning socialists.  One step
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;forward and two steps back.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So what's the answer, peeling off the bandaid and tossing it aside?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Granted, a bandaid on a gaping chest wound will not solve the problem.  But 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will stepping over the patient and looking the other way do any better?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I think the hard part that a lot of people are unwilling to accept is that
<BR>
there will be casualties.  If you are serious about changing the system,
<BR>
there *will* be a fraction of the population that won't make the cut for
<BR>
social triage.
<BR>
<P>The situation is complicated in that the bandaid is often responsible
<BR>
in part for the injury inflicted.  What is the point of creating the
<BR>
bandaid if one is still willing to inflict the injury in the first place? 
<BR>
Part of the problem is that this issue is often presented at as a &quot;bandaid
<BR>
or no bandaid&quot; decision by politicians rather than a &quot;prevention or cure&quot;
<BR>
issue, largely because politicians with bandaids are viewed as &quot;solutions&quot;
<BR>
rather than as being part of the problem.  Real solutions would require
<BR>
tacit admissions by politicians and the government to a lot of things they
<BR>
would rather not admit to.  And being in positions of power, they don't,
<BR>
which is why we have lots of bandaids and no real solutions.
