<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  Linux and Mac users are happily immune to the ill effects of ILOVEYOU,
</EM><BR>
which
<BR>
<EM> &gt;  depends upon the Windows Scripting Host to get launched once it's triggered
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  on the user's computer.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  And that's where Microsoft needs to belly up to the table.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  It's been more than a year since ExplorZip should have sent a wake-up call
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  to Microsoft, about the dangers of Visual Basic scripts running in e-mail.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  The silence from Redmond has been deafening.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  Microsoft has always been about features, features, features. But in its
</EM><BR>
mad
<BR>
<EM> &gt;  rush to throw everything into its products but the kitchen sink, the
</EM><BR>
company
<BR>
<EM> &gt;  has given security criminally short shrift.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with you Harvey, Microsoft has always payed less than adequate
<BR>
attention to security in its products. Even when security flaws are found,
<BR>
exploited and published they still dont address the issues properly if at
<BR>
all.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Microsoft certified pro, or *Sheep* if you will. I was taught that
<BR>
windows NT was the most secure O/S since &quot;sliced bread v 1.2&quot; , but even with
<BR>
the documentation and wide use of L0pht heavy Industries &quot;L0pht Crack&quot; for
<BR>
breaking NT passwords, Microsoft still sold NT as Uncrackable and only after
<BR>
years have they addmited its weaknesses and still havent
<BR>
come up with a solution.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I deal with MS software all day every day, and It scares me to look at
<BR>
security alerts because every time I do, there is another hole in an MS
<BR>
product.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;I Love You&quot; virus has not taken me by suprise at all. I have dealt
<BR>
with 4 seperate &quot;infections&quot; in the last 6 months. All of which have been MS
<BR>
office related.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the programers at MS should spend less time trying to circumvent
<BR>
their own security in order to get hidden &quot;Easter Eggs&quot; released with their
<BR>
software to impress their friends, and more time ensuring that the finished
<BR>
product is at least some way near secure for the end user.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rant rant rant......etc
<BR>
