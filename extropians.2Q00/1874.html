</EM><BR>
<P>I'd agree with you that British officers would be brought up on war crimes 
<BR>
charges, and would agree with such action. I'm not a blind-supporter of the 
<BR>
army's behaviour in N.I.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Conventional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;techniques are incapable of winning against native insurgencies. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Insurgents win by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;merely continuing to exist until the oppressors get tired of the expense 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;away, opressors can only win if the insurgents are wiped out to the last 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;man and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the remaining population is happy with their new leaders/owners.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>You discuss the nature of victory. If wiping out the last insurgent is 
<BR>
victory, then what government can ever win, as you point out.
<BR>
<P>I doubt that is the intent of the British government. I believe the intent 
<BR>
is to create a &quot;peace&quot; that results in a N.I. that doesn't require a 
<BR>
military presence to &quot;police&quot; it.
<BR>
<P>I once tried to find out if there ever had been a &quot;victory&quot; against similar 
<BR>
terrorist organisations. I found none, although the demise of the 
<BR>
red-brigade in Italy was interesting.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The SAS troops in Ireland had one mission and one mission only: to kill, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extreme prejudice, any IRA partisans they got ahold of.
</EM><BR>
<P>Any evidence to back this very specific claim? I doubt that this was the 
<BR>
SAS' only mission throughout the troubles. If, and whenever it was, it 
<BR>
would have been illegal and I'd be happy to see the instigating parties 
<BR>
prosecuted.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Everybody wants peace. Some are willing to compromise to acheive it, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;others will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only accept peace on their terms, some have the idea that peace means the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other guy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is put back in his place of subservience, and some will only accept peace 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other guys are dead and buried.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, effectively what I said.
