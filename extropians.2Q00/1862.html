<P><EM>&gt; Ah, curious as to when it was realized - the link between telomeres and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cancer??  I figured it out in 1980 at the Life Extension conference held at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Disneyland Hotel, as I best recall.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have me beat by 11 or 12 years then because I probably didn't put
<BR>
the pieces together until '91 or '92.  [But heck, I was working on
<BR>
computers through most of the '80s so I've got an excuse...]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The key 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; element missing in the catalog of mental operations of most of the older 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generation - those now older than 60 - was the ability to think in terms of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems - complex feedback and control mechanisms.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure whether it is a feature of the older generation, but I do
<BR>
certainly agree that many biologists have a difficult time viewing genomes
<BR>
as programs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Taking a page from Papert's Mindstorms, those of us who were lucky enough to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work with real models of such - mainly computers - have no trouble at all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking in terms of systemic variables, but face a frustrating blank wall 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of uncomprehension in trying to convey our insights to those who have no 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such concrete, experiential models in their minds.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is true, it is diffcult, without the use of ill-fitting analogies
<BR>
for example, to translate some basic things in computer science into
<BR>
terms that can be understood by other scientists.  I may be biased but
<BR>
I'm unsure whether the converse is true.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certain questions naturally follow:  What are we missing that the next 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generation can see naturally?  How much will this blindness damage our 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efforts as extropians?  How can we prevent or offset this kind of problem?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting questions.  They are of the type that leads me to think that
<BR>
true AI is going to be developed by the first 5 year old who happens
<BR>
to get a human-mind-equivalent computer with an easy-to-use programming
<BR>
interface for his 3rd birthday.
