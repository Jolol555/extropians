<EM>&gt;(No, unfair implication, even in jest - I could never think Zeb is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idiot... even if he thinks language is an *invention*. How about binocular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;vision, eh? Bipedalism? the corpus callosum? all great gadgets that made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their free range inventors rich)

<P>If I could travel back in time to only one period and only once, it would be 
<BR>
to whenever language came to be.
<BR>
I've invented my own words for use in conversation and know other people who 
<BR>
have. I don't think that a single person sat around, making charts out on a 
<BR>
cave wall, until he finally came up with a perfect grammatical structure, 
<BR>
and then introduced it to the clan. But I can imagine a likely situation 
<BR>
where two people - probably siblings for reasons I'll mention - deviced, 
<BR>
consciously or unconsciously, a series of arbitrary signs or noises to 
<BR>
communicate with eachother.
<BR>
There's a theory, debated, which says that all extant spoken languages today 
<BR>
have a single root language which they are derived from. People have named 
<BR>
this hypothetical language and are trying to reconstruct it. At first I 
<BR>
thought this was a ridiculous idea - but when I think of it, it makes a lot 
<BR>
of sense. I'm sure that language is dependent on several genetic differences 
<BR>
that seperate us from other primates - but at some point in time, this final 
<BR>
mutation occurred in some particular individual which resulted in language - 
<BR>
it was probably his/her children, rather then he himself, who invented 
<BR>
language (he would have nobody to talk with, but his children could talk 
<BR>
with eachother). Unless there was a magic coincidence where this mutation 
<BR>
occurred in different parts of the world at different times, then this one 
<BR>
proto-language which took hold in this single clan is the basis of 
<BR>
everything we say today (the same language would spread with the genes).
<BR>
Writing though, must have been an invention - different systems by different 
<BR>
people. We have more empirical evidence of this because every writing system 
<BR>
which has come into use during the period of time we have been able to 
<BR>
observe it, has been an invention (korean, iriquois, romanizations of asian 
<BR>
languages).
