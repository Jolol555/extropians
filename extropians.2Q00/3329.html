----- Original Message -----

From: &quot;Adrian Tymes&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:wingcat@pacbell.net?Subject=Re:%20a%20new%20thread&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000518221116.97157.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">wingcat@pacbell.net</A>&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've been thinking in terms of physiological (genetic) modification to
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nervous system, and possibly nanotechnology to create the physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; interfaces on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis (I know - I'm not in a hurry).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nice dream for the future.  But a business would need to get something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out the door en route, to get itself there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Consider a dedicated neural &quot;processing&quot; center for i/o and decoding
</EM><BR>
(becaue
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it's bidirectional communication) - similiar to speech centers?  Add a
</EM><BR>
&quot;high
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; capacity&quot; nerve which connects this center to an ending in, say, your
</EM><BR>
left
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wrist.  When a physical interface is required to an external machine,
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nano-entities create microscopic electronic passageways to the surface
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the skin, which interact directly with hardware.  Advantages to this: 1)
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; might not need a &quot;standard&quot; physical interface to connect to (nanotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; adaptability), 2) probably no infection worries, 3) the nanotech could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; probably insulate the body from any raw electricity or radiation.  Also,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; since I've got nano-entities in my world - they might as well repair any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tissue damage that does occur.  :-)  Primary disadvantage: this all
</EM><BR>
depends
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on currently nonexistent technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intermediate step: determine the nature of those microscopic electronic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; passageways.  Could you come up with some that could be implanted and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left in?  If so, then there's no need for nanotech to create them on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demand, thus bringing this much closer to current tech.  (The neural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; processing center still has to be developed, of course.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>You're making sense here.  Nanotech is sexy, but not immediately practical.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey, if you've got it, use it (as appropriate).  I can send you an HTML
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version of this if you want, though it's not the best dissertation out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there, and most of what it argues for has already come into commercial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality since it was written.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Please do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; | Both problems are already being worked on.  Perhaps a good first
</EM><BR>
product
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; | - tackling only the first issue, not the second - would be a hard
</EM><BR>
drive
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; | implanted in one's arm, with an I/O plug or minicomputer worn around
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; | and communicating via induction.  The plug/computer could get stolen,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; | but stealing the data would not be a pickpocket's work, as opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; | (say) a laptop.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I like it!  You'd also have one foot in the door on more &quot;complex&quot;
</EM><BR>
projects
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (see above).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which is why it is a good *first* product.  Chain the products out so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that each one takes you one step closer to your ultimate goal, each one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; building on existing tech (previously deployed products counting as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;existing&quot; by definition).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Question - what is required to get regulatory approval on an invasive
<BR>
prosthetic device?  What about medical associations?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; | Remember, business plans are about *business*.  Funders don't care
</EM><BR>
about
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; | submissions of proposals to standards bodies - at least, not directly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My logic on this:  The development of a standard contributes to
</EM><BR>
acceptance
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and validation of your business model.  From a risk perspective: theory
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cheaper than application.  From an economic and sociological
</EM><BR>
perspective:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; society is going to require a period of adjustment to even the most
</EM><BR>
trivial
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of &quot;AHCI&quot; applications - the standards process is a good start.  There
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; many people who would view even this conversation as immoral/dangerous.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Granted.  And for that reason, it would be a good secondary activity for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the business, to protect/enhance acceptance of its products.  But just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developing the standard will not, in and of itself, generate revenue, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you also need something that does.
</EM><BR>
<P>Very true.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; | The most overriding question you'll have to address: how are you going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; | to make money off of this?  There are many ways you can do this, but
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; | have to look to find them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I suppose I would look forward to a decent salary for the next ten
</EM><BR>
years,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; develop a working prototype in late 2009, go into production in 2010,
</EM><BR>
retire
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in 2012.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Aye, and there's the rub.  Businesses have trouble predicting the market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even five years out, so funders don't like to invest in startups that,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even if things go as planned, won't see a penny of income for ten years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, get something that can go into production by 2005, and one can plan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to use the profits from that to fund research through 2010, since the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; funders can cash out on the first one if things go bad.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Your forcing me to reevaluate - thank you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; BTW, having retired, what would you do then?  If you've been working on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this for ten years, and now that it hits the market, people are coming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up with all kinds of uses, would you really be content to only further
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your vision for a mere two years?  (Maybe you *could* retire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; financially.  There's a reason why people like Bill Gates and Larry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ellison are still with their current companies, regardless of what one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinks of said companies.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>You're right, I was being dramatic.  There is almost nothing that could keep
<BR>
me from my work - at least, for as long as my efforts are valuable.  Anyway,
<BR>
thanks for your input.  If you don't mind, I might contact you one of these
<BR>
days to discuss further.  For now, I only have time to dream...
<BR>
