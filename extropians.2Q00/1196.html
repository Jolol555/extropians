<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, Anders' IQ is about 10 points above mine and I think he is in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the same camp I'm in on this scenario.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks, but I thought it was the other way around - you 10 points
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; higher than me? Maybe we have some kind of weird intelligence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rock-scissors-paper loop here... :-) 
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that is experience weighing in rather than raw intelligence,
<BR>
so I'd agree with the analogy.
<BR>
<P>I had a individual working for me a couple of years ago who went
<BR>
through MIT, I believe, with a 4.0 average.  He could run circles
<BR>
around anyone I've ever met, with the possible exceptions of
<BR>
Eric D. or Robert F.
<BR>
<P>The interesting thing about being moderately smart is that it
<BR>
lets you *clearly* see how very smart the really smart people are.
<BR>
I'm often struck by &quot;everyday&quot; situations (some of which crop up
<BR>
quite often in Russia) where I become aware of how the average
<BR>
individual hasn't the faintest clue of the *real* range that
<BR>
intelligence can span.  I think there was a posting on the EI-list
<BR>
or on /. a few months ago about how &quot;clueless&quot; the average individual
<BR>
is.  It is presumably a form of mental self-preservation, not knowing
<BR>
what you really might be capable of with some IA.  But it touches
<BR>
on the issue of why more people aren't demonstrating in the
<BR>
streets in favor of technologies to uplift them to the levels
<BR>
mentioned above.
<BR>
<P>You can put &quot;Wouldn't you like to add 50 points to your IQ?&quot; in
<BR>
the same class as &quot;Wouldn't you like to double your expected
<BR>
lifespan?&quot;.  Most people have no idea what it really means.
<BR>
<P>Robert
