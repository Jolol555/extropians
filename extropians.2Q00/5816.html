<P>
Thank you for the link, Brian.  I've had some interesting experiences using
<BR>
plants for purifying soil and water. One of the most interesting has been
<BR>
using water hyacinth to clear water.
<BR>
<P>The land I live on has no easy access to underground water, which is one
<BR>
reason it was never settled (I don't know whether I mentioned it before, but
<BR>
the land is very much the same as it was 500 years ago; it was considered
<BR>
trash land, due to the extremely poor soil and lack of water).
<BR>
<P>Although I now have rainwater storage for drinking water and a limited
<BR>
amount of household water, most of the household water and all the
<BR>
irrigation water comes from an earth pond, which has about an acre in
<BR>
surface area when it's full and is around 15 feet deep in the center.
<BR>
<P>The pond water is turbid with suspended particles of clay which are of such
<BR>
low mass that the Brownian motion of the molecules prevents them from
<BR>
settling out. They easily pass through a .5 micron filter. This presents no
<BR>
problem for irrigating, but I find it aesthetically unpleasant to bathe in
<BR>
water that has the appearance of pork gravy. (it has a very high iron
<BR>
content)
<BR>
<P>I tried various flocculants, including the newest organic polymers on the
<BR>
market, and I couldn't get anything to work but alum.  The alum works great
<BR>
to get the water crystal clear, but I didn't like the idea of dumping the
<BR>
residue on my land (or anywhere else), so I began experimenting with various
<BR>
plants.
<BR>
<P>I found that water hyacinth will clear the water nicely, although it does
<BR>
take longer than using alum. Interestingly, the animals prefer to drink the
<BR>
water hyacinth treated water over every other kind of water I've offered
<BR>
them, including city water, rain water, pond water, and bottled spring
<BR>
water.  I don't know what effect water hyacinth has on pathogens in the
<BR>
water.  It did take away the unpleasant odor associated with &quot;iron
<BR>
bacteria.&quot;
