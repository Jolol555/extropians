<P><EM>&gt; Yes, it's really quite amazing that the intellectually gifted Carter could

<EM>&gt; be such a dunderhead in the White House, while the less intelligent Reagan

<EM>&gt; could be so brilliant.

<P>Every president's legacy only becomes evident sometimes many years
<BR>
after that president is out of office.  From today's perspective, Carter's
<BR>
strategy for what weapons to purchase was *exactly* right.  He
<BR>
bought *exactly* the right things, cancelled exactly the right programs.
<BR>
Carter understood, he foresaw, he grokked.  Then, Reagan
<BR>
came along and just bought eeeeeverything, revived bad programs Carter
<BR>
had killed.  Turns out, spending the commies into oblivion was faaaaar
<BR>
cheaper than an actual shooting war, was it not?  So the simple minded
<BR>
staggeringly wasteful Reagan doctrine did the job, without a shot being
<BR>
fired.
<BR>
<P>War is horribly wasteful.  It must be stopped for humanity to achieve
<BR>
our full potential.  Achieving a final peace might involve those stunningly
<BR>
expensive developments, such as space based lasers, THAAD
<BR>
missiles, and other things that have not been announced.  spike
