From: Joe Dees &lt;<A HREF="mailto:joedees@addall.com?Subject=Re:%20GUNS:%20Prevention%20vs.%20Punishment,%20Parental%20vs.%20Child%20Responsibility&In-Reply-To=&lt;004301bfa7a0$df7bc620$1510a8c0@pacbell.net&gt;">joedees@addall.com</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt;      As the Prez said, we punish reckless drivers, but we still install child
</EM><BR>
seats and seat belts.  We punish airplane hijackers, but we still have metal
<BR>
detectors and luggage inspection at airports.  It is said that an ounce of
<BR>
prevention is worth a pound of cure.  Why should firearms be the only thing
<BR>
where prevention is forbidden?
<BR>
<P>Why are you quoting the prez, like we care about his opinion?  A better analogy
<BR>
would be, we punish hijackers, but we still have airline flights!  The goal of
<BR>
the anti gun movement is nothing less than to take away guns from honest people.
<BR>
Why do you come in here and make obviously misleading statements as if we all
<BR>
have noodles for brains?
