<EM>&gt; Brian, it's true that I'd never heard the word &quot;extropian&quot; until a few weeks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ago, although I was already familiar with nanotechnology, cryonics, etc.--at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least with the general concepts.  You obviously have been around longer than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have, and so I would have to assume that you know more about what it means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be Extropian than I do.  But from reading the principles I really can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see that your narrow definition is called for. Actually, I've never claimed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be Extropian.  I found this list appealing because I liked the word
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;extropian&quot; and because I'm interested in many of the ideas discussed here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I don't think your posts really have to do with what's extropian and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what's not.  I sense some sort of metaphysical hostility, as though you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resent the fact that someone could live slightly outside the reality you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used to and have the effrontery to discuss it in public.
</EM><BR>
<P>No it has nothing to do with your lifestyle. In fact I have a definite
<BR>
admiration for anyone who can live in such a strongly individualistic and
<BR>
self-sufficient manner. What set me off was that somehow I did get the
<BR>
impression you were considering yourself to be an Extropian. I did a
<BR>
rant on another post about how I feel about that. Sorry for any misunder-
<BR>
standing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I mentioned in an earlier post, you seem to believe that the term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;technology&quot; should be restricted to that which is developed by highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; funded, tightly organized, &quot;official&quot; institutions.  My reading of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; history of technology leads me to believe that truly revolutionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology more often than not comes from the (not-so-very-well-funded)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-institutional fringes.
</EM><BR>
<P>No again I am in agreement with you, in fact I am funding some not-so-
<BR>
very-well-funded non-institutional fringe research :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You appear to believe that I'm not capable of doing worthwhile research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because I'm not employed by a &quot;government,&quot; an &quot;accredited university,&quot; or a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;corporation.&quot; You seem to believe that the only way to further science is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to contribute money to institutions.  Did it never occur to you that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spending one's time in doing research and using one's mind and one's time to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; THINK might yield results as valuable as, or more valuable than the amount
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of money that could be made in a like time?  Money, after all, is a form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stored work--and I'm using the term work here broadly, to include mental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exertion as well as physical labor.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are right here too, and that is certainly not my belief. But what
<BR>
are you planning to do with your research results? What comes next?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I haven't mentioned another reason I choose not to have a large income, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll mention it now, to give a more complete picture.  I don't wish to pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; income taxes, thereby supporting the activities of the people operating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under the guise of the federal government. I consider most of their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activities to be &quot;Entropian,&quot; to the extent that every dollar's worth of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work given them is the equivalent of a couple of dollars worth of work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subtracted from life-enhancing activities.
</EM><BR>
<P>I certainly understand this motive myself, and I am also trying to limit
<BR>
my taxes. But I don't see it as a good reason to head to the hills. At
<BR>
least if I get fed up with this government I can easily move to some
<BR>
other more comfortable country. In my opinion your lifestyle has put
<BR>
you even more at the mercy of the government- you might find yourself
<BR>
unable to relocate so easily. From my point of view, developing larger
<BR>
(not smaller) amounts of financial resources allows me a greater
<BR>
chance to escape. Or if I choose, it allows me to support organizations
<BR>
that might help reform or protest the government. Basically in my view
<BR>
having more cash is a good thing (in general), and giving up your cash
<BR>
is bad (in general).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, Brian, I've told you a bit about myself and what I'm doing.  What is it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you're doing to further the cause? Have you stepped outside YOUR comfort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; zone lately?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, I support ExI and Foresight, each has received $10k from me so far
<BR>
with more coming soon I hope. I am now supporting Eliezer's AI/Singularity
<BR>
research indefinitely. I spend most of my time researching investment
<BR>
strategies and opportunities both in public and private companies. In
<BR>
my previous life (1997/98) I founded and sold Hypermart.net, which helps
<BR>
small businesses get started on the Web. Since then I helped start an
<BR>
angel investing group in Atlanta that has helped many startups here get
<BR>
help. I have many public and private investments, and as these grow I
<BR>
intend to continue to (hopefully) divert larger and larger quantities
<BR>
of cash to the above and other extropian/singularitarian efforts. I will
<BR>
be 26 years old on Saturday. Someday I may start another business if
<BR>
I become motivated enough, but for now I am content to let my money work
<BR>
for me.
<BR>
<P>I will admit to periods of laziness and general comfort-seeking. None of
<BR>
us are machines (in the robotic sense), we can't just work constantly...
<BR>
But in general I think I am improving, expanding, and challenging my
<BR>
limits while hopefully doing a little bit to fight entropy.
<BR>
<P>P.S. I also am getting married to Sabine Stoeckel, a fellow Extropian (from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Germany) who I met on this list in Dec. 98 :-) Now if that isn't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stepping out of the comfort zone, I don't know what is :-)
