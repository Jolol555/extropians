<P><EM>&gt;Amara:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I LOVED your post.  It echoes something I've come to appreciate in the last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;couple of years, especially the last few months; that is that consciously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cultivating behavior aimed at a SLOWER pace has substantial benefits in many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aspects of my life.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm... slowing? I would rather say that the slowing is a by-product of a
<BR>
higher level of awareness (if the slowing occurs, but there are times I'm
<BR>
still performing the same number of tasks, only I'm more aware of the
<BR>
processes and probably more efficient).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In particular, I've come to appreciate working in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;garden around our house as I never had before.
</EM><BR>
<P>My favorite part of gardening is the smell and feel of the soil.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;One sign of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is that I've begun to learn plant names, something that I never could manage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to do before.  Making myself a part of the life cycle of the plants
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you kept cut flowers long after they finished blooming and lie
<BR>
wilted in their vases? Sometimes I do that with roses, in order to pay
<BR>
attention to their end-state beauty and notice their full cycle.
<BR>
Everything has its own cycle of time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;in our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;garden has taught me to appreciate a time scale I never really FELT before:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've come to accept that some things can't be hurried, but by slowing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tempo of my perceptions and expectations and carefully paying attention to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the small signs of slow change in the developing plants I husband, I've been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;able to tap into a reservoir of insight and calm I never knew before.
</EM><BR>
<P>In general, when I'm not working, (science is not easy for me, even
<BR>
though it's my main &quot;job&quot;), I'm attracted to tasks that put
<BR>
me in a Zen state (&quot;flow&quot;) of mind. Cooking- especially those preparations
<BR>
that require many steps and a concentration, gardening, playing music,
<BR>
or painting or forms of careful body movement (aikido, yoga, feldenkrais).
<BR>
These are all tasks that require a care and attention and have their
<BR>
own pace and time and can heighten one's awareness; I'm sure that
<BR>
folks can think of many others.
<BR>
<P>Major life changes (moves, divorce, marriage, family death) can force
<BR>
one to reevaluate all aspects of one's life too, leading to a heightened
<BR>
sense of awareness, a shift in one's time-sense.
<BR>
<P>One of the biggest events that has forced (and continues to force)
<BR>
my awareness into a more focussed state, as well as teaching me
<BR>
more patience,is my current life and regular travels. I live in a country
<BR>
(Germany) where I'm not fluent in the language or customs yet. My previous
<BR>
country (USA) now appears as a foreign culture to me, even though I know
<BR>
the language. I have culture shock in each direction when I travel to and
<BR>
from the US. I carry a sense of being a misplaced person, not really
<BR>
belonging anywhere, but at the same time, I carry a strong sense of
<BR>
being a human of this planet, forgetting about country borders.
<BR>
<P>In addition, I've spent significant time in 8 other countries
<BR>
in the last two years. My travels and life in these new environments
<BR>
have a tendency to make me dizzy but I've learned that if I tune
<BR>
into my new worlds by opening my eyes, ears and keenly observe, then
<BR>
I find the travelling and different lives to be not so disorienting.
<BR>
I always soak up as much of the new culture around me as I can, and
<BR>
ask questions and keep an open mind and so &quot;foreigners&quot; are
<BR>
almost universally helpful. Because I've observed new ways
<BR>
of living one's life, in every aspect of one's life, I'm continually
<BR>
forced to reevaluate the ways that I learned in my &quot;previous&quot; life.
<BR>
And then keep the new ways that suit me.
<BR>
<P>My moves brought about a kind of forced &quot;changing perceptions and
<BR>
expectations and carefully paying attention&quot;, and I'm not sure that
<BR>
I would recommend this &quot;method&quot; (it's a steep learning curve),
<BR>
but I've learned to appreciate the new perspectives.
<BR>
