<EM>&gt;THE POLITICS OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED HUMANS

<EM>&gt;&quot;Many people love their [golden] retrievers and their sunny dispositions 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around children and adults. Could people be chosen in the same way? Would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it be so terrible to allow parents to at least aim for a certain type, in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the same way that great breeders ... try to match a breed of dog to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;needs of a family?&quot;

<EM>&gt;Friends &amp; Colleagues:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The technical ability to genetically modify the human species is advancing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rapidly, and could easily outstrip societal wisdom and oversight 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capabilities. In this Loka Alert Richard Hayes offers a superb 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;introduction to the science and politics of human genetic engineering. He 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;concludes with action steps we must take to prevent dangerously 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;irresponsible applications of the emerging human biotechnological know-how.

<EM>&gt;Coordinator Exploratory Initiative on the New Human Genetic Technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;San Francisco, CA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;We are fast approaching What is arguably the most consequential 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technological threshold in all of human history: the ability to directly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manipulate the genes we pass on to our children.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Development and use of these technologies would irrevocably change the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nature of human life and human society. It would destabilize human 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;biological identity and function. It would put into play a wholly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unprecedented set of social, psychological and political forces that would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;feed back upon themselves with impacts quite beyond our ability to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;imagine, much less control.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;These technologies are being developed and actively campaigned for by an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;influential network of scientists and others who see themselves ushering 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in a new epoch for human life on earth. They look forward to the day when 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parents quite literally assemble their children from genes listed in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;catalogue. They celebrate a future in which our common humanity is lost as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a genetically-enhanced elite increasingly acquires the attributes of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;separate species.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There is little public awareness of the full implications of the new human 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;genetic technologies or of the campaign underway to promote them. There 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are few popular institutions, and there is no social or political 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;movement, critically addressing the immense challenges these technologies pose.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If we are to have any hope of bringing human genetic engineering within 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the ambit of accountable societal governance we need to mow wry quickly. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;We need national and community leaders, activists, journalists, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scientists, scholars, and other citizens to inform themselves in short 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;order about critical aspects of the new human genetic technologies, and to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;join together to begin building nothing less than a new social movement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The notes that follow address the science, history, accompanying ideology, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and other aspects of the most critical applications of the new human 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;genetic technologies. Resources for those who want to learn more or find 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out how they can join with others seeking to engage these issues are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;listed at the end.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;THE SCIENCE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Some applications of human genetic engineering are benign and hold great 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;potential for preventing disease and alienating suffering. Other 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;applications open the door to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a human future more horrific than our worst nightmares. We need to be able 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to distinguish between these, and to support the former and oppose the latter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Genetic engineering means changing the genes in a living cell. If you have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a lung disease caused by defective genes in your lung cells, for example, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;perhaps those genes can be changed and the disease cured. Researchers try 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to do this by putting healthy human genes into virus-like organisms that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are injected into a patient's blood stream and travel to the lungs. The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;virus-like organisms insert the healthy genes into the lung cells 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;containing the defective genes. That's genetic engineering.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There are two very different applications of genetic engineering. One 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;application changes the genes in cells in your body other than your egg 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and sperm cells. Such changes - like those in the lung cells of our 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;example - are not passed to any children you may have. Applications of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this sort are currently in clinical trials, and are generally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;considered to be socially acceptable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The other application of genetic engineering changes the genes in eggs, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sperm, or very early embryos. These affect not only any children you may 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have, but all succeeding generations. This application is by far the more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consequential, because it opens the door to the reconfiguration of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human species.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The technical terms for these two applications are, respectively, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;somatic&quot; genetic engineering (after the Greek &quot;soma&quot; for &quot;body&quot;), and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;germline&quot; genetic engineering (because eggs and sperm are the &quot;germinal&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or &quot;germline&quot; cells).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Many advocates of germline engineering say it is needed to allow couples 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to avoid passing on genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis or sickle 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cell anemia. This is simply is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not true, and scientists and medical researchers who use this argument are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;betraying the trust that society grants them. More acceptable means 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;already exist to accomplish this same goal. In the technique know as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pre-implantation screening, for example, couples at risk of passing on a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gene-related disease use -in-vitro- fertilization to conceive several 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;zygotes, and only those found to be free of the harmful gene are implanted 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and brought to term. No manipulation of genes is required. Germline 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manipulation is necessary only if you wish to &quot;enhance&quot; your children with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;genes they wouldn't be able to get from you or your partner.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;HISTORY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The ability to directly manipulate the genes of plants and animals was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;developed during the late 1970's. Proposals to begin human gene 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manipulation were put forth in the early 1980's and aroused much 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;controversy. A small number of researchers argued in favor of germline 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manipulation, but the majority of scientists and others opposed it. In 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1983 an important letter signed by 58 religious leaders said,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Genetic engineering of the human germline represents a fundamental threat 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the preservation of the human species as we know it, and should be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opposed with the same courage and conviction as we now oppose the threat 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of nuclear extinction.&quot; [1]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In 1985 the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) approved somatic gene 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;therapy trials, but said that it would not accept proposals for germline 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manipulation &quot;at present.&quot; That ambiguous decision did little to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discourage advocates of germline engineering, who knew that somatic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experiments were the appropriate first step in any event. In the period 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;following 1985, and especially following the first approved clinical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attempts at somatic gene therapy in 1990, advocates of germline 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;engineering began writing in the medical, ethical, and other journals to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;build broader support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In the mid- and late 1990's these efforts received several major shots in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the arm. The ongoing success of the federally funded Human Genome Project 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in describing and locating all 80,000+ human genes fueled growing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;speculation about eventual applications, including germline engineering. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The successful development in 1996 of the ability to create a genetic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;duplicate of an adult mammal (&quot;cloning&quot;), and in 1999 of techniques for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disassembling human embryos and keeping embryonic cells alive, in culture, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were critically important. They made it possible, for the first time, to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;imagine a procedure whereby the human germline could be engineered in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;commercially practicable manner.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Advocates of germline engineering were further encouraged by the social, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cultural and political conditions of  the late 1990's, a period 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;characterized by technological enthusiasm, distrust of government 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;regulation, the spread of consumerist/competitive/libertarian values, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the perceived weakening ability of national governments to enforce laws 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and treaties, as a result of globalization.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Advocacy of germline engineering moved to the status of an openly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;acknowledged political cause in March of 1998, when Gregory Stock, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Director of the Program on Medicine, Technology and Society at UCLA (the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;University of California
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at Los Angeles), organized the symposium &quot;Engineering the Human Germline.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;All the speakers were avid proponents of germline engineering. Stock 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;declared that the important question was &quot;not if, but when&quot; germline 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;engineering would be used. The symposium was attended by nearly 1,000 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people and received front-page coverage in-The New York Times, The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Washington Post- and elsewhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Four months after the UCLA conference one of the key participants, somatic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gene transfer pioneer W. French Anderson, submitted a draft proposal to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the NIH to begin somatic gene transfer experiments on human fetuses. He 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;acknowledged that this procedure would have a &quot;relatively high&quot; potential 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for &quot;inadvertent gene transfer to the germline.&quot;  Anderson's proposal is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;widely acknowledged to be strategically crafted so that approval could be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;construed as acceptance of germline modification, at least in some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;circumstances. Anderson hopes to receive permission to begin clinical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trials by 2003.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A NEW IDEOLOGY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Advocacy of germline engineering and the new &quot;techno- eugenics&quot; (i.e., 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technologically enabled human genetic manipulation and selection) is an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;integral element of a newly emerging socio-political ideology. This 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ideology differs from conservative ideologies in its antipathy towards 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;religion and traditional social values, from left- progressive ideologies 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in its rejection of egalitarian values and social welfare as a public 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;purpose, and from Green ideologies in its enthusiastic advocacy of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technologically reconfigured and transformed natural world, human beings 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;included. It embraces philosophical, normative and political commitments 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to materialism, reductionism and determinism; to science and technology as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;autonomous endeavors property exempt from social control-, to the presumed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;priority of market outcomes; and to a political philosophy grounded in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evolutionary psychology and social darwinist views of human nature and society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This ideology is gaining acceptance among scientific, high-tech, media and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;policy elites. A key foundational text is the book- Remaking Eden: How 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Cloning and Beyond Will Change the Human Family, by molecular biologist 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Lee Silver of Princeton University. Silver looks forward to a future in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which the health, appearance, personality, cognitive ability, sensory 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capacity and life-span of our children all become artifacts of genetic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manipulation. Silver acknowledges that the costs of these technologies 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will limit their widespread adoption, so that over time society will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;segregate into the &quot;GenRich&quot; and the &quot;Naturals&quot; In Silvers vision of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;The GenRich - who account for 10 percent of the American population - all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;carry synthetic genes. All aspects of the economy, the media, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;entertainment industry, and the knowledge industry are controlled by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;members of the GenRich class ... Naturals work as low-paid service 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;providers or as laborers ... (eventually) the GenRich class and the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Natural class will become entirely separate species with no ability to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cross-breed, and with as much romantic interest in each other as a current 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human would have for a chimpanzee.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Silver continues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Many think that it is inherently unfair for some people to have access to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technologies that can provide advantages while others, less well-off, are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;forced to depend on chance alone ... (But] Ame6can society adheres to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;principle that personal liberty and personal fortune are the primary 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;determinants of what individuals are allowed and able to do. Indeed, in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;society that values individual freedom above all else, it is hard to find 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any legitimate basis for restricting the use of repro-genetics .... I will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;argue [that]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the use of reprogenetic technologies is inevitable. .
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;. . [W]hether we like it or not, the global marketplace will reign 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supreme.&quot;[2]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Silver is hardly alone. Here's James Watson, co- discoverer of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;structure of DNA, Nobel laureate and founding director of the Human Genome 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Project:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;And the other thing, because no one has the guts to say it, if we could 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make better human beings by knowing how to add genes, why shouldn't we? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What's wrong with it? ... Evolution can be just damn cruel, and to say 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that we've got a perfect genome and there's some sanctity to it? I'd just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like to know where that idea comes from. It's utter silliness.&quot;[31]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And here's Dr. Gregory Pence, professor of philosophy in the Schools of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Medicine and Arts/Humanities at the University of Alabama:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;[M]any people love their retrievers and their sunny dispositions around 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;children and adults. Could people be chosen in the same way? Would it be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so terrible to allow parents to at least aim for a certain type, in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same way that great breeders   ... try to match a breed of dog to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;needs of a family?&quot;[4]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Or consider this excerpt from an interview with University of Pennsylvania 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bioethicist Arthur Caplan:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;... [M]aking babies sexually will be(come) rare,'Caplan speculates. [M]any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parents will leap at the chance to make their children smarter, fitter and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prettier.  Ethical concerns will be overtaken, says Caplan, by the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;realization that technology simply makes for better children. 'in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;competitive market society, people are going to want to give their kids an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;edge,' says the bioethicist. 'They'll slowly get used to the idea that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a genetic edge is not greatly different from an environmental edge.&quot;'[5]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Here's noted economist Lester Thurow of MIT:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Some will hate it, some will love it, but biotechnology is inevitably 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;leading to a world in which plants, animals and human beings are going to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be partly man-made    .... Suppose parents could add 30 points to their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;children's IQ. Wouldn't you want to do it? And if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you don't, your child will be the stupidest child in the neighborhood.&quot; [6]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And here's Francis Fukuyama of the Institute for Public Policy at George 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mason University and author of -The End of History:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;[B]iotechnology will be able to accomplish what the radical ideologies of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the past, with their unbelievably crude techniques, were unable to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accomplish: to bring about a new type of human being....  [W]ithin the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;next couple of generations ... we will have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;definitively finished human History because we will have abolished human 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beings as such. And then, a new posthuman history will begin.&quot;[7]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Can it get worse than this? Yes. In Germany last year an uproar ensued 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;following statements by noted philosopher Peter Sloterdijk that the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;failure of &quot;Habermasean social democracy&quot; now leaves human genetic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;engineering (which he referred to as &quot;Selektion,&quot; a word associated with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nazi genocide) as the only means for humanity to improve its lot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;INSTITUTES OF INFLUENCE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Supporters of human germline engineering and the new techno-eugenics have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;established a number of institutes that encourage public acceptance of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their program. At UCLA the Program in Medicine, Technology and Society 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(MTS), noted above, is currently promoting the notion of aging as a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disease that can be cured through germline engineering. The Extropy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Institute, also in Los Angeles, supports &quot;evolutionary advance by using 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technology.&quot; At their annual conference last year in Berkeley, the Extropy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Institute held strategy sessions on how to organize politically to advance 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the post-human agenda, and on how to talk to the press and public about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human genetic modification in ways that build support and diffuse 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opposition. In Maryland the Human Biodiversity Institute recently 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;presented a seminar on the prospects for genetically modified humans at a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hudson Institute retreat attended by former British Prime Minister 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Margaret Thatcher. These institutes are small but growing. No comparable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;efforts are underway to counter their influence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;BUSINESS INTERESTS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The biotech industry is actively developing the technologies that would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make it possible to offer human germline engineering on a commercial 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;basis. This work is almost completely unregulated. Geron Corporation of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Menlo Park, California, holds patents on applicable human embryo 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manipulation and cloning techniques. Advanced Cell Technologies (ACT) of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Worcester, Massachusetts, announced last year that it had created a, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;viable human/bovine embryo by implanting the nucleus of a human cell into 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the egg of a cow. No laws exist that would have prevented this trans- 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;species embryo from being implanted in a woman's uterus in an attempt to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bring a baby to term. The baby would contain a small but significant 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;proportion of cow genes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Chromos Molecular Systems, Inc., in British Columbia, is developing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;artificial human chromosomes that would enable the engineering of multiple 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complex traits. People whose germlines were engineered with artificial 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chromosomes, and who wanted to pass complete sets of these to their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;children intact, would only be able to mate with others carrying the same 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;artificial chromosomes. This condition, called &quot;reproductive isolation&quot;, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is the primary criteria that biologists use to classify a population as a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;separate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;species.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;OPPOSITION TO GENETICALLY MODIFIED HUMANS?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Given the enormity of what is at stake, and the fact that the advocates of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the new techno-eugenics are hardly coy about their intentions, it is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;remarkable that organized opposition has been all but absent. Why is this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In part it's simply that the most critical technologies have been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;developed only within the last three years or so, and there hasn't been 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time for people to fully understand their implications and respond.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Also, the prospect of genetically engineering the human species is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;categorically beyond anything that humanity has ever before had to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;confront. People have trouble taking these issues seriously - they seem 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fantastical, or beyond the pale of anything that anyone would actually do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or that society would allow. As a consequence there exist no self- 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;identified constituencies of concern, and no institutions in place to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effectively focus that concern.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Further, attitudes concerning human genetic modification don't fit neatly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;within the familiar political categories of right/left or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conservative/liberal. The more useful set of categories is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;libertarian/communitarian. The libertarian right and libertarian left are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;typically less concerned about human genetic modification, which they can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accept as a property right or as a personal right, respectively. By 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contrast, the communitarian right and communitarian left tend to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;strongly opposed, the former typically for reasons grounded in religious 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beliefs and the latter out of concern for human dignity, social equity and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;solidarity. This unfamiliar alignment impedes quick and confident 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;responses by opponents.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Finally, although people intuit that the new genetic technologies are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;likely to introduce profound social and political challenges, they also 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;associate these technologies with the possibility of miracle cures, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;notably for the many tragically fatal inheritable conditions. Before any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sentiment in favor of banning certain uses of genetic technology can take 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;root, people will have to come to understand that doing so would not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;foreclose means of preventing or curing genetic diseases.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;WHAT IS TO BE DONE?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;At the policy level we will need global bans on altering the genes we pass 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on to our children, and on reproductive human cloning. We'll also need 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effective, accountable systems for regulating human genetic technologies 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that may have some beneficent uses but could be dangerously abused.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;These policies and systems are already in effect in a number of major 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;countries. France and Germany have banned both germline engineering and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cloning, the Council of Europe is working to have these banned in all 41 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of its member countries, and Canada is expected to ban germline 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;engineering and cloning within a year. The United Nations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;UNESCO, and the Group of Seven industrialized nations have called for a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;global ban on human cloning. Great Britain has a Human Fertilization and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Embryology Authority (HFEA) which licenses all research and commercial 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enterprises whose activities involve use of human eggs, sperm or embryos. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The HFEA is frequently cited as a model for other countries.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If we are to realize such policies in the United States and worldwide, is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;imperative that strong, coordinated civil society efforts toward these 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ends be initiated, and soon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As noted, little infrastructure to support such efforts currently exists. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;We will need to establish national and global-scale education and advocacy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;organizations, research and media centers, and more. Success in adopting 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the policies described above will enable us to avoid the worst threats 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;posed by the new human genetic technologies, and will allow us to better 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use our tremendous scientific and technological gifts in support of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;healthy, sustainable and equitable human future.
