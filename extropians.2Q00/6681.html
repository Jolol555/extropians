<EM>&gt;One of the changes that comes with person centered values is &quot;Person First
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Language&quot;. Unfortunately, people are still debating about some parts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person first language.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;At one time, people with disabilities were referred to as &quot;patients&quot; or by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their disability (&quot;epileptic&quot;). Today, people involved with disabilities see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these as kind of rude labels because they tend to depersonalize someone into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a stereotype and imply that the person is passive. In the 1950's people in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human services began using the term &quot;client&quot; instead. Some people object to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;client&quot; because it implies a lower social or educational status for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person with a disability compared to the service provider. Many people use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the term &quot;consumer&quot;, but some people also object to it because it implies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone who consumes and uses up resources. Some groups are using the term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;customer&quot;, to be part of the popular movement towards customer service and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;satisfaction. But even this term has people that object to it, who point out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that people getting rehabilitation services do not purchase the services;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the taxpayers or employers pay for it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The term &quot;disabled people&quot; or &quot;the disabled&quot; also has problems, since it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suggests that their disability is the person's defining feature. Remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the first principle of person centered values? People can have a disability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without being the disability. Labels that focus on limitations can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self-fulfilling - if someone thinks they are limited by their disability,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they may give up and not even try new things. Because of this, a person can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think they are more &quot;disabled&quot; than they truly are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In general, we should try to focus on the person and see both disabilities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and abilities from their point of view, instead of from a medical definition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or stereotype.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The language a society uses is reflective of its values. The term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;handicapped literally means cap in hand, a term coined during a time when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;society envisioned people with disabilities as only being capable of begging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for a living. Times and our language have changed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;People with disabilities prefer to be referred to with language that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;respects their humanity, abilities, talents and values. Person-first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;language recognizes a person's right to self esteem and to be addressed as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person first and not as disability. Referring to individuals with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disabilities as &quot;the disabled&quot;, creates an image of a homogeneous and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unusual group of persons. Terms such as these can be dehumanizing and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;perpetuate negative stereotypes about people with disabilities.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The only label a person needs is their name. Instead of labels, think of ALL
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people in terms of their strengths and abilities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;People with disabilities are &quot;People First&quot; and want the same things in life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as people who don't have disabilities. All too often their gifts and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;abilities are not appreciated because our society has focused on their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disability. Their disability is only part of who they are-not WHO they are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How many of us want to be described only in terms of the things we cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do? Our language reflects our attitudes toward diversity. A first step to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;changing attitudes is changing the way we speak about people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Labels are extremely powerful. Don't let a person's disability become his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;label. Say &quot;student who has a disability&quot; rather than a &quot;disabled student.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It makes the student more important than the disability!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from &lt; <A HREF="http://www.dpa.org.sg/DPA/publication/dpajul99/p20.htm">http://www.dpa.org.sg/DPA/publication/dpajul99/p20.htm</A> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I believe many forces are to blame for inappropriate language. For instance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;many people see or hear terms such as 'handicapped parking' and assume that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's okay in everyday speech. Others were raised during a time when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'cripple' and 'invalid' were considered proper terminology. More recently,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we have the PC, or politically correct, movement. It was PC that gave us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;jewels such as 'handicapable', 'differently abled' and the ever-popular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'physically challenged'. It's funny - I don't remember being a part of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;committee that voted yes to these.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Last, and certainly least, we have many members of the disability community
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;itself who care little about what they're called. Many individuals tell me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;you can't take that stuff too seriously&quot; or &quot;what difference does it make?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sadly, perhaps in an attempt to show society that they're not bitter, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sell us out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The importance of using person-first language can hardly be stressed enough.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Placing the person before the wheelchair, cane or speech difficulty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accomplishes two things. First, by stressing the person, it emphasizes inner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;qualities that anyone might have, and de-emphasizes physical appearance. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also normalizes the disability by sending the subtle message that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disability can happen to anyone. Compare that to 'wheelchair person' which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has sort of a space-alien feel to it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Language affects attitudes. Legislation defending the rights of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disability community might be easier to enforce if everyone saw the person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;first.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The phrase 'everyone's disabled in some way' should not be excused either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is an error in logic known as equivocation, or the changing of a term's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;definition in midstream. One minute, we're referring to a disability such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;blindness; the next minute we're equating it to forgetfulness, or being 20
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pounds overweight. The person who does this usually finds the disability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intimidating. Reducing the seriousness of the disability makes it easier to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;handle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So, what can a person with a disability do against the formidable foes of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;assertiveness and patience. When someone you meet uses inappropriate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;language, do you politely correct them, or do you accept their ignorance and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;confusion as excuses? If you do correct them, do you explain why it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;important?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Every time a person refrains from being assertive, they are, in effect,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;saying, &quot;It doesn't really matter what you call me.&quot; Correcting someone may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not be comfortable, but it's the right thing to do. If that person is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;secure, he or she will not react defensively. If they do, you must realize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that it is not your problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Any time members of a minority group speak out on an issue relating to them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they run the risk of being labelled as bitter, obsessed, maladjusted or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hypersensitive. These labels are merely a sign of society's unease. Labels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;take the place of true understanding, while also discrediting the person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;presenting the issue.
