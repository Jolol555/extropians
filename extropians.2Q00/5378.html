<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do feel &quot;trapped&quot; in the area of working and providing for my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basic needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but than that is a good thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>John, I don't see how feeling trapped could EVER be a good thing (I know you
<BR>
were sort of joking, but I sensed a bit of belief there as well)!
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;When I moved recently(no choice) that drained my finances to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; where I could not afford the conference.
</EM><BR>
<P>As long as you're alive there are always options for the future. And since
<BR>
you apprently are healthy and not in prison, the number of options you have
<BR>
is so great as to almost seem infinite. I've found that realization to be
<BR>
one of the most exhilerating thoughts I've ever had.  I cherish the
<BR>
lifestyle I have right now, and part of what makes it good is that every day
<BR>
I remember that I could choose to walk away from it and do something
<BR>
completely different.
<BR>
<P>If you feel trapped, it might be an interesting exercise for you to think of
<BR>
something really different from what you're doing now that sounds like fun,
<BR>
and mentally go through all the steps you'd have to take to accomplish it.
<BR>
Like...ummm...how about moving to Winnemucka, Nevada and getting a job in a
<BR>
small engine repair shop. The steps to do this might include visiting
<BR>
Winnemcuka to find a job, going back to Alaska and selling your furniture,
<BR>
renting an apartment in Winnemucka, etc.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Or you could search the internet for something you're especially
<BR>
interested in...if it were me, I think I'd do a search on the genetics of
<BR>
peach trees.  I'd find someone doing research in that area and imagine
<BR>
trying to get them to hire me to assist with their work. If that strategy
<BR>
didn't work, maybe I'd sign up for graduate school there and try to get a
<BR>
fellowship or a teaching assistantship.
<BR>
<P>You mentioned that you wanted to get an education.  I got the impression
<BR>
that you meant a university degree.  So maybe you'd want to figure out what
<BR>
university would be fun to attend, again maybe do a search on something
<BR>
you're really interested in and find someone or ones who are doing research
<BR>
in that area.  Then imagine writing to them to find out more about their
<BR>
work and about the school, maybe going for a visit, taking the SAT or
<BR>
whatever it is you have to do to get in, selling your furniture, renting an
<BR>
apartment in the university town, finding a job there, etc.
<BR>
<P>As for next year's conference, you could start saving up money right now so
<BR>
you'll be sure to have enough to attend.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am one of those people who don't like leaving my comfort zone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Alaska, my girlfriend and my little job here are a big part of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, that's understandable.  Maybe you don't need to completely leave your
<BR>
comfort zone.  Just stretch it a little at a time.  Here's something
<BR>
interesting I noticed when I was learning how to fly airplanes. When I was
<BR>
working on getting my landings smooth, I used to spend fifteen minutes or so
<BR>
just sitting and thinking about landing the plane.  I'd close my eyes and
<BR>
picture myself turning from the downwind leg to crosswind and then onto
<BR>
final.  I'd imagine how I'd have to head a bit into the wind to keep lined
<BR>
up with the runway and how I'd slip a bit to lose altitude if I had some to
<BR>
spare.  And so forth.  I found that these pre-flight imagination sessions
<BR>
dramatically improved my actual performance.
<BR>
<P>So I'm thinking that if you just mentally go through the steps of picking up
<BR>
and moving, you might get so used to the idea that when you finally DO it,
<BR>
you'll be taking your comfort zone with you.
<BR>
<P>Bonnie
