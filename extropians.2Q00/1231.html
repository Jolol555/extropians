<EM>&gt; Impressive!  Using their somewhat simplified simulation of the most

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How this translates into computational requirements for the typical
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neuron is not a trivial task.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I argued somewhat incorrectly with Hans Moravec during his peer review of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the paper he published in the 'Transhumanist Journal', that his estimate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of of 10^15 ops/sec for the human brain may need to be adjusted upward to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; account for intraneuronal complexity.  However, this study would appear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to support my claim.

<P>Maybe, maybe not. Until we have a good understanding of how low-level
<BR>
electrochemical activity produces computation, we really can't say how much
<BR>
of this detail needs to be simulated. Reproducing a neuron's computation is
<BR>
certainly going to be much less complex than simulating the neuron in detail
<BR>
(because you don't need to fully simulate metabolism, self-repair, etc.),
<BR>
but working from first principles like this it is hard to say whether we are
<BR>
talking about a difference of one order of magnitude or several.
<BR>
<P>However, I think you are wrong to dismiss indirect measurements based on
<BR>
comparisons between the human retina and computer vision systems. My
<BR>
understanding is that we know exactly which image processing occurs in the
<BR>
retina (as opposed to elsewhere), and that makes it easy to compare it to
<BR>
artificial systems. If it takes X FLOPS to duplicate the retina's image
<BR>
processing, it seems reasonable to expect that duplicating other
<BR>
retina-sized slices of neurons would also take X FLOPS (give or take an
<BR>
order of magnitude).
