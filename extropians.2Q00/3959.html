<P><EM>&gt; Thanks for the explanation. I gather from your explanation that your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; original post was...how shall I say?...facetious.  Still, it brings up some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting trains of thought. The quantum computer thing sounds pretty much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like an old fashioned god.
</EM><BR>
<P>Essentially, however, one of the interesting things about quantum computations
<BR>
is all steps happen at the same time to the outside operator, they cannot
<BR>
interfere in the simulation being run.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But in order for the guy running the simulation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be entertained by the simulation, he? she? it?  would have to give the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acting subjects some equivalent of free will or at least build in random
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; determinates of the subjects' behavior, don't you think?
</EM><BR>
<P>Assuming that the purpose is for entertainment is not really a viable one, IMHO.
<BR>
Its more a matter of testing possible alternate histories or alternate sets of
<BR>
physical laws.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So if the subjects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are given the ability to think and learn, I still don't see why you say that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we couldn't escape from the simulation. (I'm guessing that one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assumptions of the quantum computer theory is that humans are part of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer simulation.  In this case,at least some of the subjects in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simulation have the ability to think and learn).
</EM><BR>
<P>Since you are part of the simulation, you cannot escape the simulation during
<BR>
the course of the simulation, however there are the possibilities of both
<BR>
sending messages to the operator that they can read after they have finished
<BR>
running the simulation, and they could also conceivably keep a log of the whole
<BR>
simulation and pull your personality out of it as a separate entity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I saw *The Matrix* yesterday and thought the acting and special effects were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very good.  I enjoyed some of the dialogue immensely, liked the emphasis on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the individual and the presentation of a heroic hero. But I found the story
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disappointing overall.  The idea of the simulation was intriguing, but I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sorry the authors didn't give the machines some more interesting use for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans than as sources of electrical energy.
</EM><BR>
<P>The energy thing was there purely for purposes of product placement. Duracell
<BR>
payed a lot of money for their battery to be used in that scene. However, it
<BR>
also helps debase the idea of the human as a part of the system. If the concept
<BR>
had been that the AI gained its conciousness from everyone's minds being merged
<BR>
as a large computer, then there would be the issue of moral qualms over it, at
<BR>
least as far as the more communalist/socialist/communistic people who watch the
<BR>
movie would be concerned. Individualists like myself would still see it as
<BR>
criminal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would an intelligent machine necessarily be curious?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see why not. Your brain is a machine. Why are you curious?
