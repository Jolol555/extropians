<P>This is known in the trade (and the media coverage) as the `donkey vote',

and has indeed been significant in several tight elections.

<P>&lt; Donkey vote

<P>&lt; A ballot paper on which the voter has ranked candidates from `1' onwards
<BR>
straight down the ballot
<BR>
paper without regard to the merits of the candidates; also refers to the

total number of votes

allocated in this way. &gt;
<BR>
<P>By and large, it balances out, since places on the ballot paper are
<BR>
allocated by chance. The donkey vote tends to be no larger than a couple of
<BR>
percent (and sometimes, again by chance and connivance, it actually is
<BR>
appropriate to vote straight down the form - since a party might advise its
<BR>
team to vote for the guy at the top and their enemy is at the bottom, and
<BR>
it doesn't significantly matter which order the rest are checked off so
<BR>
it's easier just to run straight down and prevents spoilage of a vote by
<BR>
filling the ballot incorrectly).
