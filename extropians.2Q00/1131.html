I have a feeling that one day in the future, we will consider capitol
<BR>
punishment just as barbaric as foreign countries see us now, (Europe seems
<BR>
to look down on our electric chair) or as we now view the guillotine. I
<BR>
acknowledge that I have extreme viewpoints towards hypocritical punishment.
<BR>
Here's our government &quot;we do not allow killing, it is wrong, so we will kill
<BR>
you&quot;. To me, (and I know not a lot will agree, here's where I throw in a
<BR>
disclaimer: people can use physical punishment towards their own children,
<BR>
that's their family, their business, and their choice, although I would
<BR>
chose not to&quot;) it is just as ironic as if I had a child (say Timmy), that
<BR>
was hitting the neighbor kid , 'little Cindy' from down the street, and I
<BR>
said &quot;Timmy it's wrong to hit other's&quot; and proceeded to hit him 'as
<BR>
punishment'. I know that not everyone will agree with this, but I think
<BR>
exact punishments, tend to escalate the action. If we kill murder's, does
<BR>
this prevent any further murders?

<EM>&gt; &gt;While I am very big on individual self defense, I have come to abhor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;state-sponsored killing in general.  As things currently stand in most if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;not all countries, the state is not held to the same standards of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;justifiable homicide as the individual.  While creating such a standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;effectively eliminates the death penalty, in the absence of such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;standard I would prefer to explicitly eliminate this ability from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;state.  Arguably, only individuals can have the right of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;self-defense anyway, since the government is made up of nothing more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;individuals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sounds nice.  But the minute you hold the state to the same standard as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individuals, the state gives up all police power (except in those few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumstances were governmental employees or property are harmed or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threatened) and all prisons must be emptied.  That might sound like a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing to you, but the day it happens here is the day I move to Costa Rica.
