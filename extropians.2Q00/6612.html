<P><EM>    &gt; Without Einstein, Michaelson and Morely probably would have done
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; their experiment to measure the ether, failed, and come up with
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; relativity to explain their failure.
</EM><BR>
<P>Special Relativity was in the air in 1905 when Einstein came up with it, if
<BR>
he hadn't somebody else would have in a year or two. However when he
<BR>
discovered General Relativity in 1916  it really came out of the blue and
<BR>
nobody else was even close to it. Feynman is quoted as saying he has
<BR>
no idea how he could have thought up something so original. I remember
<BR>
reading another quote from a Nobel prize physicist (I think it was Feynman
<BR>
again but I'm  not sure) saying  that without Einstein it might have been another
<BR>
century before anybody found it. We'll never know for sure.
<BR>
<P>By the way,  Michaelson and Morely performed their famous experiment the
<BR>
year Einstein was born, although he hadn't heard of it in 1905. It was not well
<BR>
known for many years, even Michaelson didn't think it was important, he looked
<BR>
on it as a failed experiment and figured he must be doing something wrong.
<BR>
Einstein came to relativity by way of pure theory.
