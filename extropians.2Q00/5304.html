<EM>&gt;&gt; I should have said the ecomomic apathy that results from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;handouts was perhaps a fundamental flaw of human nature.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This is an important point that should not be glossed over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In a full-nanotech era, assuming you don't copy yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;endlessly, you have more resources than you &quot;need&quot; (~= to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;current situation for anyone with a net worth in excess of $1-10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;million at current interest rates).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'll make the general observation that many current high net-worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individuals do not have to work to survive (having reached pseudo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;communistic state condition), yet most of them still get up and go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to work every day (Paul Allen being an extreme case in point).
</EM><BR>
<P>I would argue that Paul Allen did not receive a handout, but earned
<BR>
his wealth by hardwork and perhaps the mistakes of others. He has
<BR>
invested wisely, (I'll skip the Mariners joke) and enjoys the fruit
<BR>
of his labors. I'll further argue that his being so richly rewarded
<BR>
for his efforts drives his ambitions.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;So, the question becomes whether the handouts generate apathy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(implying communism is self-defeating) or whether a significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;majority of individuals would do nothing if they could still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;survive (implying communism cannot work due to human nature).  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;question then becomes *what* would happen to capitalistic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;societies if you released a virus that killed all individuals that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;demonstrated a high degree of risk-taking/personal-drive (i.e. the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;high net-worth individuals who work when the really don't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to)?
</EM><BR>
<P>I would argue that the former welfare state in this country make's
<BR>
the point.
<BR>
<P>If you succeeded in killing off those who work for a living the
<BR>
rest would fight over the scraps.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Extending this, will full-nanotech result in a pseudo-communistic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;condition where the desire to excel has little survival advantage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and is bred out of the population (presumably dooming humanity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and leaving the solar system to AI's programmed with a &quot;succeed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or commit suicide&quot; mentality).
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure could...... the ultimate couch potatoes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Still playing DA, I could say that tens of thousands of years of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; communism had left your villagers at the level of a stone age
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; tribe.... ;)
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I think that is a stretch.  I suspect you could attribute most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of Western &quot;progress&quot; to a few individuals with excessive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;curiosity, talent, or genius level mentality and not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capitalistic systems per se.  It is worth noting that many of said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individuals had state support in the form of the aristocracy or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;favor of royalty.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah I was stretching it a bit. 
<BR>
<P>Rewarding people for their effort is the very definition of
<BR>
capitalism. In fact such people invented capitalism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;One can note that communistic systems have been very effective at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;educating masses of people (do you *really* want to discuss the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fraction of people *reading* on the Moscow metro trains vs. the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;NY metro trains???) and creating systems that can support a large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;base of engineers whose abilities seem to speak for themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would suspect that the New Yorkers can read (maybe not, they're
<BR>
talking about electing Hillary) but the fact they don't read as
<BR>
much could point back to the idea of handouts or maybe general
<BR>
affluence as the culprit.
<BR>
<P>Nothing but compliments for the engineers and scientists. Of course
<BR>
to such people the ability to learn is a form of reward.
<BR>
<P>Affluenza...&lt;shudder&gt; potentially deadly.
