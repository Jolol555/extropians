Here's the attitude I like to have when dealing with people, either in
<BR>
person or on the internet (I don't always succeed though):
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Respect the other person to the extent of recognizing that she's most
<BR>
probably doing the best she knows how with what she has.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Assume that the other people respect me (this makes a huge difference
<BR>
in the way I interpret messages--someone can call me an asshole, and if I
<BR>
interpret their statement through this filter, it's like water rolling off a
<BR>
duck's back)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In the case of messages which seem to be sarcastic in a mean way,
<BR>
respond to them as though the writer was being sincere (there's the risk
<BR>
here of appearing to be &quot;simple&quot; minded, but I've found it better to run
<BR>
that risk than to run the risk of alienating someone by coming back with a
<BR>
snappy response, especially if it turns out that the person WAS actually
<BR>
being sincere)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. If a message seems irrational, hold off responding to it for a day or
<BR>
two (I like Amara's Pause That Refreshes idea--this is along the same lines
<BR>
I think)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. This last one's sort of weird, but I find that it works for me.  If I've
<BR>
lost my cool and gotten REALLY MAD at someone, and I find myself mulling
<BR>
over cruel things to say to them, I ask myself something like, &quot;What if this
<BR>
person is suffering from a serious mental illness, and the mean thing I say
<BR>
pushes them over the edge and they snap and start killing people or kill
<BR>
themselves?&quot; I guess this thought occurs to me because I've seen it
<BR>
happen--not to me, but to someone I knew.  She said something very mean to
<BR>
her husband, and he shot her through the head.  How much better it would
<BR>
have been to just keep quiet and leave!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Keep ideas as the subject of debate, not personalities.  I had a friend
<BR>
who got a job selling an encyclopedia door to door.  As part of his
<BR>
training, he had to read a book called _The Art of Manipulation_.  I don't
<BR>
know whether it's still in print, but if it is, I'd highly recommend it.
<BR>
Not to say I'm in favor of manipulating people, but the book has some great
<BR>
advice about getting along with people. On the subject of disagreeing with
<BR>
people it suggests the following approach: G says something you think is
<BR>
wrong.  You say, &quot;Well, G, you know, 9 times out of 10 I'd agree with you.
<BR>
But I think you may be overlooking a couple of things in the present case.&quot;
<BR>
I've tried this with friends, and even though we all know the line and know
<BR>
what the other person's doing when they start out like that, it's amazing
<BR>
how it facilitates getting across a controversial idea. And it's not like
<BR>
you're lying.  You probably WOULD agree with most people about many things,
<BR>
especially on a mailing list of people with similar interests.
