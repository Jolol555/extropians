(This is answered in DA-FAQ at the anthropic-principle.com site.) It is in
<BR>
the nature of probabilistic reasoning that in untypical circumstances people
<BR>
who use it will be misled. If the human species survives for a very long
<BR>
time, then the people living shortly after the Industrial Revolution will
<BR>
have been in a highly untypical situation; they will have been misled by the
<BR>
Doomsday argument, but they will not have been irrational to accept it (if
<BR>
there were nothing else wrong with it - which, however, I argue that there
<BR>
is). In order to evaluate something like DA you'd have to look at its net
<BR>
effect, not just its effect on a few highly atypical observers. Now, most
<BR>
observers (nine tenths) will be among the middle 90% of all observers who
<BR>
have ever existed. If every observer thinks, in accordance with DA, that
<BR>
there will probably not be hugely many more observers after her than before
<BR>
her, then the vast majority of all observers will turn out to have been
<BR>
right.

<P><EM>&gt; The Everett-Wheeler many-worlds theory is actually simpler than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contemporary theory - it omits state-vector reduction - yet still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; predicts the existence of our world.  The Modified Razor strikes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many-Worlds down because it predicts our world much less uniquely than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the modern theory of physics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
This relates to the problem of measure in many-worlds interpretation. The
<BR>
MWI could have a good fit to data, if it could be showed that it assigns a
<BR>
high probability to a relatively large fraction of all observers who are in
<BR>
the same reference class as ourselves observing what we observe. The case is
<BR>
very similar to multiverse cosmologies - e.g. chaotic inflation, where lots
<BR>
of real universes exist with different boundary conditions and physical
<BR>
constants. How our evidence favours or disfavours such models is something I
<BR>
discuss in detail in the thesis, and the same arguments can be applied to
<BR>
MWI.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Use of the Anthropic Principle is permitted, but you must demonstrate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a sufficiently large number of samples exist - otherwise the theory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would not predict the existence of the exceptional sample
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
That's correct: in order to explain the fine-tuning of our universe by
<BR>
appealing to an anthropic principle, you need a suitable ensemble of actual
<BR>
universes out there (&quot;possible worlds&quot; won't do). But evidence for
<BR>
fine-tuning is a reason to think that there is a multiverse.
