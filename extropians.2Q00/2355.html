<EM>&gt; &gt; Three intersections locally now have what appears to be cameras mounted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; above each center lane signal. There has been no public announcement as to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; these being for surveillance, and from the angle they are mounted at, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; looks like they would have a hard time capturing driver's images and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; license plates. Perhaps an image processing traffic light controller?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nope. Its a light pulse sensor unit that allows oncoming police, fire engines,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and ambulances with their lights going to cause the light to turn green. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Here's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a fun thing to do, especially at night: Learn to get a sense of the strobe 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the emergency lights of these vehicles, then at night flash your high beams
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on and off several times at that rate (hopefully when nobody is coming in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opposite direction) as you approach the intersection. I do this and its pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good at turning the lights green for me at intersections that have this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capability. This is a good way to go through lonely intersections without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually breaking the law... ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>No, these gadgets are not Opticon sensors. Those are up there, too. What I 
<BR>
see is a hooded, lensed box exactly like a CCTV camera, aimed down at 
<BR>
approximately 45 degrees TOWARD traffic. It would have a nice field of view 
<BR>
of the cars stopped waiting for the light. There's one camera for each 
<BR>
direction at the intersection - four in all.
<BR>
<P>The Opticon sensors are (here) small black cylinders with a tube jutting 
<BR>
out of either side, pointing in both directions of the road it services. 
<BR>
There is also a white floodlight that comes on when the Opticon is 
<BR>
triggered. They are nicely sensitive to IR, so a suitable pulsed IR source 
<BR>
would trigger them stealthily.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you are really smart, buy yourself a hand strobe with a variable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;setting and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;keep it set to a frequency similar to emergency vehicles....as long as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doesn't look like a siren, you aren't impersonating an official vehicle...
</EM><BR>
<P>My partner was a volunteer fireman, as well as being an anarchist. He made 
<BR>
such a strobe - built into a floating flashlight case, powered by 4 D 
<BR>
cells, range about 1000 feet. We've been too chicken to take it in a moving 
<BR>
vehicle, at least until we get the IR filter nailed down.
