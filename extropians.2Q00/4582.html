<EM>&gt; Anarcho-capitalism seems to require a society based on personal freedom.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, since the current societies do not fall into that cathegory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A company actually creates a mini-state with its own hierarchical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dictatorship.
</EM><BR>
<P>A dictatorship implies an organization capable of resorting to violence to
<BR>
enforce its will. Corproations do not have this ability. There are no IBM
<BR>
secret police arresting their rival's customers, no Microsoft assassins
<BR>
eliminating key enemy personnel, and no armies of Dell and Compaq
<BR>
infantrymen clashing to secure the buying public's dollars.
<BR>
<P>The only thing companies can do now that they couldn't do in a pure
<BR>
anarcho-capitalist society is bribe politicians to pass laws - and lobbying
<BR>
for protectionist legislation is one of the few things I haven't heard
<BR>
Microsoft accused of.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since companies buy and sell the stuff, it seems only natural to me that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anarcho-capitalism will not work too well in that environment.
</EM><BR>
<P>The PC market is one of the least regulated markets in existence. It should
<BR>
therefore be expected to work better than most other markets, and any
<BR>
failures it does exhibit should be a result of government intervention.
<BR>
<P>So, what do you do when a company you consider to be inferior comes to
<BR>
dominate the market? Accusing them of evil anti-competitive practices misses
<BR>
the point - companies would do the same kinds of things in a stateless
<BR>
society, and in that case there would be no one to stop them. No, there are
<BR>
really only two viable explanations: either free markets don't actually work
<BR>
very well, or your personal evaluation of which companies ought to do well
<BR>
is somehow flawed.
<BR>
<P>Now, the interesting thing here is that our standard arguments for why
<BR>
central control is bad predict that the second explanation will usually be
<BR>
correct. In general, I can't reliably tell which product is best for you,
<BR>
you can't predict which one is best for me, and neither of us can speak for
<BR>
Tom, Dick or Harry. It should therefore not be surprising if the dominant
<BR>
product in an industry isn't the one you like - all that means is that most
<BR>
of the market has different needs than yours.
