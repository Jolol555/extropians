<EM>&gt; &gt; ActiveX components are simply Windows executables. Making a runtime for

<EM>&gt; &gt; run on other OS's. This is *not* a simple task, and not one Microsoft is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; willing to allow (they refuse to document the APIs, hence everything has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to be reverse-engineered).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What alternate universe are we talking about here? I know it can't be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real world, because I currently have on my hard drive a complete set of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft  documentation for pretty much the entire Windows API set. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't quite give this away, but they come pretty close - it's only a couple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hundred dollars a year for a complete subscription.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Obviously they don't completely document every possible bug, side effect or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unsupported call in existence, but that isn't because there is some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conspiracy to keep it secret. Rather, it is because they only have so much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money to spend on developer outreach. The information they do make available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is far more complete that the docs I used to work with for Unix and Mac
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; APIs, and about as good as I would ever expect to see for a product that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes substantially every few years.
</EM><BR>
<P>The documentation you have is not complete. 
<BR>
<P>It's certainly not enough to create an alternative environment in which
<BR>
programs talking the Windows API could operate (please take us in
<BR>
context - we were discussing the Wine project and such possibilities).
<BR>
<P>Michael pointed out, and I conceded, that it *may* contain enough to
<BR>
write an environment capable at least of handling most ActiveX programs.
