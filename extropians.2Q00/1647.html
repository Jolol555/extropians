<P>
I agree with John about this. Human beings have an enormous capacity for
<BR>
self-deception, no matter what their stated beliefs about religion and
<BR>
science. We tend to see what we want to see and believe what we want to
<BR>
believe. Remember the reports from reputable scientists about &quot;polywater&quot;
<BR>
back in the late '60s? (It turned out to be the result of contaminated lab
<BR>
equipment.) Before that there were many reports by astronomers from the
<BR>
early 1900s of the alleged planet Vulcan orbiting between Mercury and the
<BR>
Sun. And so it goes....
<BR>
<P>Our capacity to delude ourselves is generally a subconscious response to our
<BR>
desire for fame, or self-esteem, or simply to dampen the fear of our own
<BR>
mortality.
<BR>
<P>Extropians perhaps have a clearer appreciation of this than others, as we
<BR>
prepare to &quot;take arms against this sea of troubles and by opposing, end
<BR>
them&quot; -- not with suicide, as Hamlet contemplated with those words, but by
<BR>
putting an end to death itself.
<BR>
<P>That being said, I must confess that we, too, can fool ourselves into
<BR>
believing that uploading, or resuscitation from cryonic storage, or the
<BR>
singularity, etc. will happen soon enough for us all. My own sense of the
<BR>
situation is that we might be the parents, or grandparents, of the
<BR>
generation that puts an end to death. In the meantime, we've got to do what
<BR>
we can to help bring that about even if, like Moses, we never enter the
<BR>
Promised Land.
<BR>
<P>(But there could still be hope! After all, Tipler could be right and we'll
<BR>
all be resurrected as immortal emulations at the Omega Point. Or maybe
<BR>
that's the biggest self-deception of all, given the number of Tipler's
<BR>
testable hypotheses that have not proven true.)
<BR>
<P>Whether we make it or not, I believe that our memes, and the individuals who
<BR>
carry them forward in time, will live and never die!
<BR>
<P>Regards to all,
<BR>
Mike LaTorra

<P>Is it that simple?  I doubt that.  I believe people(atheists included) can
<BR>
be very good at unconscious self-deception even when they think they are
<BR>
being objective.
