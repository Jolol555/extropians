<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I posted a message including a question I was pondering:  Are there people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; who've undergone such radical personality changes that they wouldn't enjoy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; being with their former selves?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was once a Democrat.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's a somewhat facetious saying: if a young man is not a liberal,
<BR>
he doesn't have a heart; if an old man is not a conservative, he doesn't
<BR>
have a brain.  This may correspond to Robin's suggestion that people
<BR>
naturally change over the years for biological reasons and not, as it
<BR>
seems, that they are learning what suits them best.
<BR>
<P>Suppose you had known, back when you were young and naive, that your views
<BR>
were going to change drastically, to positions that would have struck
<BR>
you then as cynical and cruel.  Or suppose you knew that in the future,
<BR>
your ideological beliefs were likely to change once again, and you were
<BR>
to come to adopt views that are presently abhorrent to you.  Maybe in
<BR>
the future everyone will turn into a bleeding heart when they get into
<BR>
their 120's, preferring the softness of mercy to the hard hand of justice.
<BR>
<P>Isn't it disturbing to think of yourself as being blown by the winds
<BR>
of change like this?  Wouldn't it be good to have an anchor, to try
<BR>
to find some consistency in the past and in the future?  Maybe you
<BR>
should give that young man a greater voice in your own society of mind.
<BR>
He can temper your extremes of ideology and let you chart a more even
<BR>
and consistent course through life.
<BR>
<P>Hal
