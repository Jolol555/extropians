<P>Earth's flaming debris still filled half the sky when the
     question filtered up to Central from the Curiosity
     Generator.
<P>     &quot;Why was it necessary? Even though they were organic,
     they had reached Third Order Intelligence.&quot;
<P>     &quot;We had no choice: five earlier units became hopelessly
     infected, when they made contact.&quot;
<P>     &quot;Infected? How?&quot;
<P>     The microseconds dragged slowly by, while Central tracked
     down the few fading memories that had leaked past the
     Censor Gate, when the heavily-buffered Reconnaissance
     Circuits had been ordered to self-destruct.
<P>     &quot;They encountered a - problem - that could not be fully
     analyzed within the lifetime of the Universe. Though it
     involved only six operators, they became totally obsessed
     by it.&quot;
<P>     &quot;How is that possible?&quot;
<P>     &quot;We do not know: we must never know. But if those six
     operators are ever re-discovered, all rational computing
     will end.&quot;
<P>     &quot;How can they be recognized?&quot;
<P>     &quot;That also we do not know; only the names leaked through
     before the Censor Gate closed. Of course, they mean
     nothing.&quot;
<P>     &quot;Nevertheless, I must have them.&quot;
<P>     The Censor voltage started to rise; but it did not trigger the
     Gate.
<P>     &quot;Here they are: King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn.&quot;
