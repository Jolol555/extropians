<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking of organ donation - did you see my MODS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (Mutual Organ Donation Society) proposal?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Any reason to think that it would not solve the organ donation problem?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; - See  <A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/OrganDonation.html">http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/OrganDonation.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Good ideas. Make it a mutual benefit society, get a non-profit charity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;incorporation, and you only need to donate 5% of the association's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;organs to non-members to retain the non-profit tax deductible status.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Then the word gets out that you are 20 times more likely to get an organ
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;if you join the club...moreover, allow the person donating to deduct the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;value of the organ from their income or probate taxes as a typical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;charitable donation, and you have instant probate protection of a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;$250,000 to $1 million in assets when your estate is settled.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Don't know how to calculate the value of an organ...
</EM><BR>
<P>several criteria:
<BR>
a) what is someone willing to pay for it at auction on ebay (last I
<BR>
heard a kidney was attempted to be auctioned on ebat, and bidding
<BR>
reached $14 million before it was pulled.)
<BR>
b) what is a transplant center willing to pay for the organ. If you only
<BR>
allow certified transplant centers to bid on organs, you could probably
<BR>
contain bidding to a more 'reasonable' level. As more transplant centers
<BR>
open, you will get more bidders, but I would imagine you would also get
<BR>
more qualified suppliers as the system expands.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This may be easier to arrange if there is a profit motive here as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well - there may be some public/private partnerships opportunity here,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I am not an expert.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Frankly, I think that a person who figures out how to solve the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organ donation problem, should be able to benefit from it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about making it a private company with viral marketing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can you sign people up on the Web?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does anybody want to work with me on this, or know anybody who would?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can one leave conditional organ donation clauses:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;my liver goes to a confirmed white Russian-speaking female atheist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who joins MODS within 3 months from myself&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>I dunno, that might be construed as violating equal protection, and
<BR>
violate a matter of equal membership in the society. However, if you
<BR>
have a network that allows people to find their tissue matching partners
<BR>
that need organs, you could name them as beneficiaries in your will.
<BR>
However the  gov't might try to impose a gift tax or some sort of
<BR>
probate tax on the bequeathment. The first thing to do is to lobby
<BR>
congress to make a probate loophole for organ donations. Once that is
<BR>
done, you can work on the rest.
