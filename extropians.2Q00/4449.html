<EM>&gt; &gt;  I think everyone should take at least one shot at the &quot;join a hot startup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  and get rich quick&quot; route to millionaire status. You may fail, in which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  case you can fall back onto the careful saving/investing approach, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  then again it might work out quite well, leaving you enough cash to help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  use for other extropian/singularitarian purposes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which get rich quick scheme do you recommend?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ha. At 22 I started a business with two older guys with an idea that I
<BR>
thought would make me millions. Government policy changed, budgeting
<BR>
dissapeared, and well, those virtual millions did too. I did get an
<BR>
excellent education in start-up and operation of a business. Since then
<BR>
I've been self employed and making a decent living (with far less stress
<BR>
than being under someone elses' thumb), and am getting ready to launch
<BR>
my own ISP company up here.
<BR>
<P>One lesson I've learned: no partners. Investors maybe, but no operating
<BR>
partners, nobody with an equal say in getting things done. Decisions get
<BR>
made with no hassle, and you only have yourself to blame. Much less
<BR>
stress. 
<BR>
<P>Lesson two: finance only when you absolutely have to. 
<BR>
<P>Lesson three: buy used equipment when you can, or else build it
<BR>
yourself, let some other schmuck pay for the depreciation, and for gods
<BR>
sake, pay wholesale...if not distributor or clearance cost. Only buy new
<BR>
equipment when you absolutely must have the latest and greatest, which
<BR>
is rarely. I'm currently about $1,000-2,000 from launch date (which
<BR>
looks like some time in July, depending on what comes up).
<BR>
<P>Lesson four: keep your day job. I don't plan on dropping my regular
<BR>
consulting clients until well after the ISP is generating at least 50%
<BR>
more money, net, than I am making now. I should reach that point
<BR>
somewhere up around 400-500 subscribers, if not less.
<BR>
<P>Thats my two cents as Mr. Business Guru...
