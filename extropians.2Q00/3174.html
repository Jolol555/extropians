<EM>&gt;  There is an old saying...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &quot;Those who tell don't know, and those who know don't tell&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>To which Sentient Eliezer quipped:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Aw, c'mon, can't you just say &quot;That is because, for some types of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  knowledge, the process of discovery results in richer cognitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  structures than hearing an explanation?&quot;  'Cause otherwise it sounds a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  bit, you know, mystical.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's nothing mystical about this saying!  In fact it doesn't refer to what 
<BR>
you say at all. It's a jab at know-it-alls, gossips and over-analyzers! 
<BR>
Knowledge is rarely publicized by the wise. 
<BR>
Typically, more foolish (or naive) people are ego-stricken and have a &quot;need&quot; 
<BR>
to go about blabbing how smart and knowledgeable they are, while a true wise 
<BR>
one is more likely to keep quiet allowing the observer to ask, bear and 
<BR>
learn... really learn... with dignity.
<BR>
<P>Coincidentally
<BR>
Someone I consider VERY wise recently told me they felt as if they were up on 
<BR>
a high place, scanning the horizon, being silent... but they were monitoring 
<BR>
the world around... and would speak up without hesitation if need be.
<BR>
<P>It's all about honoring your own worth and integrity without making yourself 
<BR>
a pain to other people.
<BR>
Not mystic at all ... but filled with strong spirit for truth and honor!
