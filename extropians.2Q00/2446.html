<EM>&gt; hands, it is on the proliferation of the virus.

<P>I disagree.
<BR>
<P>The DOS-based Windows family (not NT or 2000) is still layered on top of
<BR>
an abomination that has no filesystem based security policy. This is the
<BR>
first headache; any process can read/write anything it damn well pleases
<BR>
on any mounted filesystem.
<BR>
<P>The second problem is that Microsoft, in search of usability improvements,
<BR>
persistently prioritise security below user convenience. This makes sense
<BR>
from a marketing point of view in a non-security-literate field, but it's
<BR>
a disaster when the systems they're making get hooked up to a wide area
<BR>
network. In general, secure systems tend to be a pain in the butt to
<BR>
work with -- but they're secure; that's part of the reason they're a
<BR>
pain. Microsoft tries to take the pain out of things -- and ends up driving
<BR>
a cart and horses (or an eighteen-wheeler) through security.
<BR>
<P>The combination of a proliferation of security back doors (email clients
<BR>
that can execute arbitrary code embedded in email, that can fiddle with
<BR>
the contents of any file on the root filesystem, for gopod's sake!) is a
<BR>
vulnerability to viruses.
<BR>
<P>This is not to say that MacOS or UNIX-family systems are immune -- but
<BR>
they're more resistant. While both these OS's have 3-6% of the market
<BR>
share of Windows, they have much, much less than 3-6% of the number of
<BR>
viruses; in the case of Linux, while two or three have been written as
<BR>
demos, there has never been a virus observed in the wild in the decade
<BR>
since Linus released his first kernel. Linux is simply very inhospitable
<BR>
to self-propagating infections. In fact, UNIX in general is inhospitable.
<BR>
While human-driven hacking tools are widely available, it's possible to
<BR>
harden a system against them very easily: most such exploits involve bugs
<BR>
in individual subsystems which can be tested and, where necessary, swapped
<BR>
out and replaced with a secure alternative, or shut down completely.
<BR>
<P>You have to go all the way back to the RTM worm of 1987 to see an incident
<BR>
in which a worm crippled a goodly number of all the UNIX systems on
<BR>
the net. ILOVEYOU just goes to show that Microsoft have failed to learn
<BR>
from someone else's lesson, thirteen years on.
