<P>
Many people have asked me whether Sasha had arrangements for cryonics 
<BR>
suspension. From my own knowledge and by checking with others who knew him 
<BR>
well, I am fairly certainly that he never made suspension arrangements.
<BR>
<P>I feel rotten in delivering this additional blow, but it seems right to 
<BR>
convey this to everyone who has shown such an outpouring of feeling. 
<BR>
Clearly Sasha was loved and respected widely. The very least we can do is 
<BR>
to preserve his web-based thoughts (preferably in multiple places). 
<BR>
Certainly ExI will do this, so long as his son Eugene does not object.
