<P>From: Adrian Tymes &lt;<A HREF="mailto:wingcat@pacbell.net?Subject=Re:%20First-date%20Intellectual%20Dazzlement%20(was:%20Pig%20comment)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200006171541.RAA16959@galileo.mpi-hd.mpg.de&gt;">wingcat@pacbell.net</A>&gt;, Date: Tue, 13 Jun 2000 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Hmm...maybe this has been my problem.  I, myself, value success, wit,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intelligence, et cetera above physical beauty in my companions, yet I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a man.  Whenever I try to date a woman, one of the things I try is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hold an intelligent conversation over a wide range of topics, including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some that I estimate the woman knows better than myself - anyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can't do that, I do not wish to share my life with.  This has rarely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;failed to dissapoint, among the ones I have dated.  One of them (who I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;am still friends with) complained, &quot;It's like talking to God.&quot;  
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;So, is the message I should get from this thread that I should stop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;looking for intelligence and just adopt the common male practice of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;judging by looks alone?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>No. There are many ways to look for intelligence other than seeing
<BR>
how (or if) a woman can hold a conversation with a man. And note that
<BR>
there are many ways that people &quot;connect&quot;, that are complementary
<BR>
to intellect.
<BR>
<P>(capacity of intimacy, use of intelligence, education, money,
<BR>
appearance, skills, spiritual beliefs, leisure time use, money,
<BR>
status, age, playfulness, emotional maturity, how your personal
<BR>
power flows, energy levels, personal joys etc.)
<BR>
<P>Let's see if I can rephrase your first-date description in the way
<BR>
that you meant:
<BR>
<P>On a first date you usually try a high-level conversation over a
<BR>
wide range of topics in order to see if she can keep up, or, in some
<BR>
cases, show her broader knowledge. (And in the process you learn
<BR>
about her successes, wit, etc.) Did I understand you correctly?
<BR>
<P>So then, let's assume the above is your filter that you are running 
<BR>
*on her*.
<BR>
<P>You can be pretty sure that she is running her own filter *on you*.
<BR>
<P>Her filter is quite possibly working _between_ your words. That is,
<BR>
not only hearing your words, but observing how you use them, how
<BR>
you're paying attention to her, and then from your words and her
<BR>
filtering process, she may be making a first hypothesis of who you
<BR>
are.
<BR>
<P>What are the possible items running in her filter? 
<BR>
<P>&quot;What are the ideas of his worldview?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;What motivates him? What are his passions?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Is he giving me a space to state my opinion?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Is he paying attention and listening to my words?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Do his words match his actions?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Does his life and lifestyle match his worldview?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Do I find his appearance pleasant?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Are his actions towards me showing respect and consideration?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Do his actions show responsibility to his work, family, friends?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;How does he handle money?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Does he appear healthy?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Does he take good care of himself?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Can he keep or avoid eye contact with me?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Does he seem kind?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Does he have any addictions that might be a problem?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Does he have hobbies? What does he do in his leisure time?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Is there room in his life for me?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Does he seem interested in learning about my passions?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;How easily can he admit that he might be wrong?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Can he laugh at himself?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;How easily does he laugh?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Does he appear comfortable with himself?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;Is he looking for a relationship based on needs? or based on wants?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;What is his opinion about children?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;How does he educate himself?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;What are his short and long term goals?&quot;
<BR>
&quot;How much is he committed to learn about himself? About me?&quot;
<BR>
etc.
<BR>
<P>I suggest that it might not be a good strategy on a first date to
<BR>
find a person of intellect by dazzling that person with a broad
<BR>
range of conversational topics. Why?
<BR>
<P>1) If she is running some of her own filters, then you'll run a risk
<BR>
of overloading her. She has enough of her own processes running.
<BR>
<P>2) If you are trying to dazzle her, then she might not find the
<BR>
space or opportunity to state her opinion. Plus, even if she did know
<BR>
more about some of those topics than you, being in a situation of
<BR>
talking with a fellow who is presenting himself as the expert might
<BR>
annoy, disinterest, or otherwise not motivate her to say anything.
<BR>
<P>3) If she is intelligent, then she probably has equally intelligent
<BR>
friends, and therefore she might not be easily impressed by your
<BR>
intellectual dazzlement.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
(And if she _is_ impressed by your intellectual dazzlement, then is
<BR>
that really the kind of woman that you want?)
<BR>
<P>I suggest that women you meet might repond much better to behavior
<BR>
that shows curiosity, interest, honesty, gentleness, vulnerability,
<BR>
humor, playfullness, consideration, and respect much more than a
<BR>
bold presentation of one's wide-ranging intellect and successes.
