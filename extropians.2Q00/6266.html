<P>
(more) regarding laser interdiction of projectiles.
<BR>
<P>Some very many years ago I used to read novels by David Drake.  They were 
<BR>
pretty weak but I identified with them.....Drake was a Viet Viet and he had 
<BR>
some pretty neat (in my opinion) ideas.  (or anyway...his mood and mine 
<BR>
coincided...very dark)
<BR>
<P>He had &quot;super tanks&quot; and &quot;power guns&quot;...the power guns being very much like 
<BR>
what I would imagine hi-wattage laser beams would resemble.   In those 
<BR>
stories the power guns would interdict incoming projecticles of all 
<BR>
sorts....mortars....rockets....maybe even bullets for all I can 
<BR>
remember.....anything &quot;line of sight&quot; was toast..  In theory wouldn't this be 
<BR>
possible?  I would imagine it would depend upon the cyclic speed of the laser 
<BR>
and the refractoryness (is that a word?) of the target.
<BR>
<P>Regardless...it would seem that :
<BR>
<P>a: Regans notion is being vindicated by technological advance (fat  chance 
<BR>
that he gets any recognition for it in the media)
<BR>
<P>b. Tactics if not Strategy on the battlefield must change........again...
<BR>
<P>C.  I want one. (again....fat chance)
