<P><EM>&gt; | I spend a lot

<EM>&gt; | microprocessors (and also the extensions of that basic interface -

<EM>&gt; | telepathy, anyone?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Telepathy sounds incredibly wonderful - but I don't think we have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetic basis for any sort of wireless brain-brain communication.  Throw in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the right machinery though...
</EM><BR>
<P>...and cite the upcoming experiment of one Prof. Warwick, who wishes to
<BR>
hook a device to his and a willing partner's (his wife's) nervous
<BR>
system, such that signals which one device detects are played back in
<BR>
the other's.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; | If any of you bright people know of anybody out there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | working on making this possible, I would be very interested in initiating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | contact with them.  I actually have an outline for an experiment I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; | love to try, on animal or insect models.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm considering the possibility of putting together a business plan.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; initial goal would be to obtain funding for an extended period of research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the biological and computer technology aspects of this concept.  An
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; early milestone might be the submission of a comprehensive &quot;Advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Human-Computer Interaction&quot; RFC to IEEE and other standards organizations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is a lot of money being spent on HCI research, which I see this as an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extension of.  Ideas, anyone?
</EM><BR>
<P>You'd need to be able to develop bio-safe implants.  Main problem:
<BR>
infections around breached skin (as in, where the skin meets the plug or
<BR>
the display screen).  Not a problem in rooms where surgery performed
<BR>
(allows temporary breach to insert devices); major problem for
<BR>
day-to-day use in public spaces.
<BR>
<P>Possible solutions:
<BR>
* Seal devices completely within the body.  Communicate with and repower
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;devices by induction, which need not breach skin.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantage: existing technology, already commercially deployed for some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;life-critical applications (like artificial hearts).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Disadvantage: long-term effects of necessary strength induction fields
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;on skin unknown.
<BR>
* Develop artificial skin that can merge with edge of plug/display
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;screen, or can serve as surface of such.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantage: easier upgrades to and interface with implants, allowing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wider range of uses.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Disadvantage: needs extensive R&amp;D.
<BR>
* Keep devices completely external to body.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantage: mostly existing tech and therefore wide range of existing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;solutions for easy plug in; only new stuff is interaction with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nervous system.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Disadvantage: decreased sensitivity to control signals; research shows
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unacceptable skin degradation and significant signal diffusion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;problems for transmitting signals into nerves this way.

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<P>There's also the little issue of decoding neural signals, though
<BR>
fortunately, if you keep the signals you send/interpretation of what you
<BR>
receive fairly constant, human nervous systems can adapt to the desired
<BR>
result over time if the human trains with it.  (Babies take a year or
<BR>
two to learn to walk, for example.)  The closer you can get to what the
<BR>
particular human already has, the less training time needed - and thus,
<BR>
the less people who will ultimately give up and request the implant be
<BR>
removed.
<BR>
<P>Both problems are already being worked on.  Perhaps a good first product
<BR>
- tackling only the first issue, not the second - would be a hard drive
<BR>
implanted in one's arm, with an I/O plug or minicomputer worn around it
<BR>
and communicating via induction.  The plug/computer could get stolen,
<BR>
but stealing the data would not be a pickpocket's work, as opposed to
<BR>
(say) a laptop.  There's a potential problem with upgrades, but the
<BR>
steady stream of new users, and licensing and reselling some of the
<BR>
better upgrades that those who buy the system and tinker around with it
<BR>
come up with (which would probably be a significant percent of the early
<BR>
market), should make up for this revenue.  It would also provide lots of
<BR>
real-world research on HCI for devices that people have good reason to
<BR>
use as extensions of their body, rather than as foreign objects.
<BR>
<P>Remember, business plans are about *business*.  Funders don't care about
<BR>
submissions of proposals to standards bodies - at least, not directly.
<BR>
The most overriding question you'll have to address: how are you going
<BR>
to make money off of this?  There are many ways you can do this, but you
<BR>
have to look to find them.
