<EM>&gt;Subject: Murder rate going up?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Date: Fri, 23 Jun 2000 08:33:41 -0700 (PDT)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;From a brief in today's Investors Business Daily p A2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The murder rate is going up in New Orleans, Baltimore, Boston,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, and Phildelphia. Experts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are unsure if this is only temporary.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Actually, I strongly suspect all the crime figures.  Local papers reported 
<BR>
not too long ago that many police departments have begun adopting policies 
<BR>
of refusing to take reports on all but &quot;serious&quot; crimes.  The reality in 
<BR>
Santa Ana, CA however, appears to be that &quot;serious&quot; is likely more connected 
<BR>
with how much money is likely to be garnered via siezures, fines, etc. than 
<BR>
in how much damage it does to the individual victims, if any.
<BR>
<P>Last night, for example, someone decided to vandalize my motorcycle - this 
<BR>
happens about every other month, as my office is located right across the 
<BR>
street from the bario, whose gang reps can be seen regularly cruizing the 
<BR>
area in their &quot;cars with a boom&quot; or low-rider bicycles.  Nothing can be left 
<BR>
out for even a minute without the liklihood it will be stolen.
<BR>
<P>So, at about 4:45AM, someone suddenly started pounding on the front door.  
<BR>
It sounded as though they were trying to break in.  I was in the bathroom, 
<BR>
and, by the time I got there, they were gone and my motorcycle was lying on 
<BR>
its side against the air-conditioner which juts out of the front wall onto 
<BR>
the concrete landing.  I had to pick the bike up - 630 pounds - to get it 
<BR>
off the air conditioner and prevent damage from battery leakage, etc., and 
<BR>
afterwards my back was hurting a little so I figured I should make a police 
<BR>
report, if only so that I could refer to it if I had to make a claim against 
<BR>
my property insurance carrier for on-the-property injury, in case the back 
<BR>
strain turned serious.
<BR>
<P>When I called the Santa Ana police, I get this idiot who uses every argument 
<BR>
he can think of to refuse taking a report.  In the past, I have always 
<BR>
gotten good cooperation on these incidents.  I made the mistake of 
<BR>
mentioning to this guy that similar incidents had happened repeatedly in the 
<BR>
past.  So he starts asking me, in this unbelievably snide, sarcastic tone, 
<BR>
&quot;and did your making a report ever, in all these incidents, result in any 
<BR>
arrest or get you any compensation.  No.  So what is the point of making 
<BR>
this report now?&quot;
<BR>
<P>I point out that this establishes a pattern, in case the perps are ever 
<BR>
caught, and that, furthermore, I would like to have it on record if I have 
<BR>
to substantiate a medical claim later.  Then he comes off the wall.  &quot;Well, 
<BR>
your injury has NOTHING to do with the alleged crime.  We don't get involved 
<BR>
with that.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I ask, if it happened to an officer that he was in any way injured while 
<BR>
investigating or dealing with the consequences of a crime, wouldn't the perp 
<BR>
be charged with that, in addition to the direct act itself?   No reply.  So 
<BR>
now, even though I tell him twenty or so times that I'm not asking that 
<BR>
ANYTHING be put in the report about my injury, he keeps insisting that 
<BR>
because my private purpose in getting the report on file is to potentially 
<BR>
reference it later for insurance purposes, therefore he can't file a report.
<BR>
<P>Finally, after about twenty minutes of going round and round, he finally 
<BR>
asks if I would like an officer to come by.  I finally tell him yes, if they 
<BR>
can get there in a reasonable time.  He says that they should be there 
<BR>
pretty quickly as the shift has just changed.  I stand on the landing for 
<BR>
the next hour and thirty minutes.  No police.  While I'm in the bathroom 
<BR>
again, they arrive (7:02AM) and then leave.
<BR>
<P>I crash out on the floor, exhausted.  My planned trip to Mexico is now 
<BR>
pretty much off the table.  At about noon, I call the PD back and get this 
<BR>
woman who is even more idiotic than the guy.  She tries to tell me, in 
<BR>
addition to the erroneous diversion about my injury - she grilled me on why 
<BR>
I was making a report - that I should not be making a report anyway, as I 
<BR>
was NOT the victim!  Who was the victim?   ... You guessed it, THE 
<BR>
MOTORCYCLE is the victim.
<BR>
<P>This, of course, is the logical complement to the evil,unconstitutional and 
<BR>
vicious seizure policy by which the PD makes its money - about 50% of the 
<BR>
budget for most of the Orange County police, according to the Orange County 
<BR>
Register a few years back.  If you're doing anything illegal in a car, in 
<BR>
theory they can seize the car as an accomplice.  The car is then charged 
<BR>
with the crime.  In order to get the car (or home, or business, or boat, 
<BR>
etc.) back, you have to petition the court and then PROVE in court that it 
<BR>
was innocent.
<BR>
<P>Now, this is turned around to its logical corrolary.  If the motorcycle is 
<BR>
responsible for a crime, then obviously it can also be the victim of a 
<BR>
crime.  I suppose that this is a great precedent for all those eager 
<BR>
would-be uploads and SI champions among us; however, I never got a reply as 
<BR>
to how my motorcycle was supposed to have reported its vandalizm.  The lady 
<BR>
immediately changed the subject.
<BR>
<P>So, if someone torches my home, then, unless I was injured directly - and 
<BR>
not in trying to put out the fire or rescue my cat, etc. - the home was the 
<BR>
only &quot;victim,&quot; and I don't even have the right to file a report.  (Actually, 
<BR>
carrying this to next logical step, if I get burned alive, then it was the 
<BR>
HOME's fault, and it should be charged with murder, or at least as an 
<BR>
accomplice, and - naturally - seized, if there's anything left to sell for 
<BR>
the PD coffers.)
<BR>
<P>When I continued to press my demand for a report, the lady started implying 
<BR>
that I was making the whole thing up.  Then she started accusing me of 
<BR>
engaging in &quot;borderline criminal fraud&quot; - as I was potentially planning on 
<BR>
using the report for an insurance claim.
<BR>
<P>After being cut off once and put on hold numerous times, with still no 
<BR>
report, I finally gave up.  Obviously, the Santa Ana PD is no longer in the 
<BR>
business of assisting the citizenry at all.
<BR>
<P>Down the street from me, a few years back, there was a huge meth lab.  When 
<BR>
they moved out, they left hundreds of boxes lying around outside, each 
<BR>
filled with 1,000 tab empty psuedophedrine bottles.  I.e., they were so 
<BR>
confident of non-prosecution they make no attempt to conceal their tracks or 
<BR>
evidence.  Wonder how much of a cut went to Santa Ana's finest?
<BR>
<P>Like I said, crime reports are suspect, perhaps more so now than ever.
