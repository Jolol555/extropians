Thanks for the explanation. I gather from your explanation that your
<BR>
original post was...how shall I say?...facetious.  Still, it brings up some
<BR>
interesting trains of thought. The quantum computer thing sounds pretty much
<BR>
like an old fashioned god.  But in order for the guy running the simulation
<BR>
to be entertained by the simulation, he? she? it?  would have to give the
<BR>
acting subjects some equivalent of free will or at least build in random
<BR>
determinates of the subjects' behavior, don't you think?  So if the subjects
<BR>
are given the ability to think and learn, I still don't see why you say that
<BR>
we couldn't escape from the simulation. (I'm guessing that one of the
<BR>
assumptions of the quantum computer theory is that humans are part of a
<BR>
computer simulation.  In this case,at least some of the subjects in the
<BR>
simulation have the ability to think and learn).
<BR>
<P>I saw *The Matrix* yesterday and thought the acting and special effects were
<BR>
very good.  I enjoyed some of the dialogue immensely, liked the emphasis on
<BR>
the individual and the presentation of a heroic hero. But I found the story
<BR>
disappointing overall.  The idea of the simulation was intriguing, but I was
<BR>
sorry the authors didn't give the machines some more interesting use for
<BR>
humans than as sources of electrical energy.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I'd like to see a film or read a story that was presented at least partly
<BR>
from the point of view of the machine, in which the reader or viewer is
<BR>
taken inside the mind of the machine.  This would be a challenging story to
<BR>
write, because the author would have to wrestle with the question of the
<BR>
nature of consciousness. A really interesting story might be one in which
<BR>
the reader doesn't know at first that she's being taken into the mind of the
<BR>
machine.
<BR>
<P>On the nature of intelligence--the discussions I've participated in or read
<BR>
seem to assume that an intelligent machine would surpass the human mind in
<BR>
speed and complexity but would be qualitatively the same.
<BR>
<P>Some of the dictionary definitions of intelligence leave a bit more leeway
<BR>
for the imagination.  Take &quot;the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate
<BR>
one's environment,&quot; for example. (Webster's Collegiate)
<BR>
&nbsp;where knowledge=being aware
<BR>
aware=vigilance in observing and
<BR>
observe=inspect or make note of.
<BR>
<P>Would an intelligent machine necessarily be curious?

Subject: Re: The Matrix
<BR>
<P>There was a popular pseudo-scientific book by Talbot a few years ago yakking
<BR>
about how our minds are holograms, and that the universe is a hologram, and
<BR>
all
<BR>
sorts of other stuff. Then you've got the more recent theories of black hole
<BR>
natural selection, the idea that universes are produced by black holes in
<BR>
other
<BR>
universes, and universes that have physical laws that are conducive to
<BR>
producing
<BR>
black holes that produce other universes also are universes that have
<BR>
physical
<BR>
laws that make life possible. Couple this with the idea of the quantum
<BR>
computer,
<BR>
which theoretically can simulate a whole multiverse at a time, and you're
<BR>
talking about some Universe Prime above ours where some dude is running our
<BR>
universe as a simulation on his quantum computer (then there may be someone
<BR>
in
<BR>
another macroverse that is running HIS universe on a computer, and so
<BR>
forth..
