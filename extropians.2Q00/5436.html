Spike, I really like your concept of the wooden head.
<BR>
I can see a marriage of this to the psychology of Eric Berne, (who
<BR>
was talking about non-contributors using specious arguments about
<BR>
imaginary disabilities.  (The game of wooden-leg.)
<BR>
<P>&quot;I can't think about this.  I've got a wooden head!&quot;
<BR>
<P>Two cents on the cross-sex experience issue:  What would it cost you
<BR>
to model &quot;whatever&quot; is needed to explain the difference between your
<BR>
behavior and that of the opposite sex (an example like a friend or
<BR>
co-worker in close proximity would help).   My best friend from the
<BR>
age of 15 is a woman.  I often have to model her if she's not around
<BR>
and I need her perspective......actually the net helps a lot there. 
<BR>
Scary thought....maybe I wouldn't have developed the skill if we had
<BR>
had the net at the point where we diverged geographically for
<BR>
college.  Interestingly, she reports the same experience, needing
<BR>
to model me for the perspective.   How well this works, as opposed to
<BR>
its 'comfort' value, is certainly open to question, but I really
<BR>
think it's worth trying.  To say that it's of no value is
<BR>
vitalism--I'm saying that the visible difference 'is' the difference,
<BR>
for the sake of argument.  Before experience-sharing technology, we
<BR>
do at least have our innate modeling skills.
