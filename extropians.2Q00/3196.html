Subject: Re: Dreams have to come from SOMEWHERE
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Are dreams the royal road to the subconscious? I doubt it. They tell a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lot about us, but many of the references are so personal they cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be interpreted by an outsider - exactly what does a cartesian product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in a unmade bed,or the third part of the trinity playing in a jungle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gym mean? Somehow I doubt an analyst can figure that out. Some parts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are probably easier to interpret, and maybe some people have less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;obscure dreams, but I doubt dreams are a better insight into our minds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than for example talking with us.
</EM><BR>
<P>Anders, are you advocating a similar position to Owen Flanagan, that dreams
<BR>
are essentially 'spandrel's?
<BR>
<P>I agree with Globus that we are &quot;dreaming&quot; even when awake, with the
<BR>
addition of external stimulus and absence of sleep motor paralysis. I
<BR>
constantly deal with &quot;artificial sleep&quot; ... my preferred term for hypnosis.
<BR>
Hypnosis is the &quot;royal road to the subconscious&quot; not dreams ... because my
<BR>
subjects can report what is happening, and integrate experiences with their
<BR>
critical faculties.
<BR>
<P>My take on dreams (the MVT perspective) is that the melatonin produced
<BR>
during REM by the lateral eyes replaces the melatonin that previously was
<BR>
produced by the pineal eye (RE. Michael Menaker ... lateral eyes, the second
<BR>
and third pineal glands?).
<BR>
<P>Aristotle pointed out that dreams have no external sensory input, so are as
<BR>
'pure' a form of consciousness as you can have (On Dreaming). MVT explains
<BR>
how sensory mentation is possible without environmentally originating
<BR>
sense-data, and also give the early evolutionary account of the phenomena
<BR>
relating to night-time pineal vision of our cold-blooded forebears.

<P>There is much more to be said on this.
