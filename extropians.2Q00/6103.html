<P>Everitt, this website claims Pluto was inboard of Neptune in the
<BR>
interval between 1979 and 1999.  Now of course, Pluto still isnt
<BR>
necessarily the *ninth* planet as your (and my) teachers insisted, since the
<BR>
the moon is not really orbiting the Earth.  The moon's orbit around
<BR>
the sun is concave everywhere, which is to say, when the moon is
<BR>
between the earth and the sun, it is pulled more toward the sun than
<BR>
the earth.  So the moon is a small planet, co-orbiting with the Earth.
<BR>
<P>Pluto and Charon swap places with Neptune for positions nine, ten
<BR>
and eleven.  Of course this is all semantics.  (There are eleven
<BR>
commandments too, count em, Exodus 20).   Now the big debate
<BR>
is whether Pluto/Charon should be considered a planet at all.  The
<BR>
astronomy community graciously waited to say much about it until
<BR>
Clyde Tombaugh, Pluto's discoverer, passed away, which he did
<BR>
three years ago at the age of 91.
<BR>
<P>Many of us here have shared the wonderful experience of hearing
<BR>
baloney in our science classes and wondering if its worth a trip to
<BR>
the office to set the record straight.  {8-]  spike
