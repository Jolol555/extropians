<EM>&gt; Mike Lorrey writes, quoting Hal:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I thought your gadget was something which you could put in empty space,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; turn it on, and it would start accelerating off in some direction,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; without shooting anything back the other way.  It acquires net momentum,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; From energy. This is why Cramer beleives it can work with masses working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at near relativistic velocities, because of the dissonance between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; momentum and velocity at those speeds. If there is such a dissonance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; then Special Relativity also violates your strict interpretation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; conservation of momentum...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I didn't ask where it got momentum, only whether it acquired net momentum.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The answer is yes, I believe, and that is enough to tell us that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't work.  No more discussion is needed about whether momentum can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come from energy, or from wishing, or from any other unlikely place.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Momentum comes from momentum, and if it comes from somewhere else then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; momentum is not conserved.
</EM><BR>
<P>So there is no such thing as explosives, exothermal chemical reactions, fusion,
<BR>
fission, radiation, etc? You are claiming that the only momentum in the universe
<BR>
is that which is pre-existing? Thats rather thin. 
<BR>
<P>Lets say I use a laser to propel myself. I'm not expending any reaction mass,
<BR>
but I am generating thrust. How is that conserving momentum? It's obviously
<BR>
using e = m * c^2 to replace mass with energy, as light has no mass.
<BR>
<P>Lets say I have two particle beams, one shooting identical numbers of protons at
<BR>
.9 C and the other shooting protons at .99 C. You also have two spaceships going
<BR>
at .8 and .89 C respectively. When the two beams hit the two spaceships,
<BR>
Spaceship A's perception of the momentum of the protons from the first beam are
<BR>
different than Spaceship B's perception of the momentum of the protons of the
<BR>
second beam, even though the velocity differential between the two pairs is
<BR>
exactly the same. Where does the extra momentum of the second beam come from?
