<EM>&gt; &gt;Excessive health? Yes, you get over population. Excessive justice? For who?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Excessive happiness? Yes of course. People that are too satisfied are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;motivated to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;further growth...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Um, excuse me, but isn't that precisely why we're all here...to *maximize*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such things as health, justice and happiness?  If you are really afraid that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you might become &quot;too healthy&quot; or &quot;too happy&quot;, how can you possibly call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself an extropian?  I haven't read the ExI principles, but I'm sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there's nothing in there about placing any limits on things like health,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longevity or happiness.
</EM><BR>
<P>Tell me, if cheap and easy nuclear fusion magically became possible
<BR>
today, and within a few months most everybody had a fusion plant in
<BR>
their back yard, what do you think would happen to the economy? How
<BR>
about if nanotech became magically possible today? I'll tell you: the
<BR>
economy would go into a major depression for a good 3-10 years. You are
<BR>
talking about making obsolete a whole economy almost overnight. 
<BR>
<P>Like an economy and levels of technology, things like health, justice,
<BR>
and happiness are achieved as meta-stable states within systems that
<BR>
have limits on input and output, they are semi-closed systems. Progress
<BR>
in improving or in moving to higher states of stability in these areas
<BR>
can only occur at rates that can be survived. I am not saying that there
<BR>
are absolute limits, but there are limits to what is possible to be
<BR>
digested *today*.
<BR>
<P>If you reach a state of total happiness, what more do you have to live
<BR>
for. Being for endless growth also implies a constant reapprisal and
<BR>
redetermination of what will make us truly happy. Reaching such a state
<BR>
before you know you want to be there will merely cause you to fail to
<BR>
appreciate it.
