<EM>&gt;&gt; Koestler wrote about the DNA code being taped over - as with a piano with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; certain keys taped over - such that only certain potentialities are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; expressed.  As cells age, however, they tend to drift back toward a more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; general expression - to become less differentiated, as the &quot;tape&quot; comes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; loose at random points, until they conclude that somehow they are not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; fulfilling their mission - or the demented version of it that now is the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; controlling goal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is Cutler's dysdifferentiation theory (which seems to have been
</EM><BR>
developed
<BR>
<EM>&gt;circa 1985).  It sounds like Koestler is recycling it (do you have a ref.
</EM><BR>
for that?)
<BR>
<P>Koestler argued that back in 1964 (!) in his wonderful cross-disciplinary
<BR>
book THE ACT OF CREATION. (Recent editions seem to have deleted the second
<BR>
half where he advanced ideas about biology and cognitive psychology that
<BR>
are now either commonplace and much more developed, or somewhat antiquated
<BR>
or even quite dippy.) He was much influenced by Waddington and Bateson.
<BR>
[And I, for what it's worth, was much influenced by him, having bought his
<BR>
book the moment it came out, yum yum.]
