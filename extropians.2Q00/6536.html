<EM>&gt; &gt;Can we all agree, though, that in general, people are willing to work 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;harder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;if their material rewards are directly proportional to the work done?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You couldn't prove it by me. I could multiply my material rewards manyfold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by writing franchise or sharecrop fiction, or better yet by churning out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;slick mega-bestsellers called QUANTUM ASTROLOGY. Would take less work and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;earn more money.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the primary goal is to be happy - having more money is going to be a 
<BR>
huge factor in that, possibly the most important, and certainly the second 
<BR>
or third. The simple reason is that you need money to get many of the things 
<BR>
which make you happy. For example, without a computer and full internet 
<BR>
access, the happiness in my life would be cut in half, at least. I need 
<BR>
money to be able to afford a computer and internet access.
<BR>
You, I assume, would not be happy writing a book on &quot;quantum astrology&quot;. I 
<BR>
could make more money by selling meth, prostituting myself, or robbing 
<BR>
people, but I would be unhappy doing so, and I have a personal rule that I 
<BR>
would only work in an office which required me to wear a tie for at least 
<BR>
20% more money. Material rewards are extremely important, but nobody is 
<BR>
saying they are the only kind.
<BR>
I'll pose my own version of what Bonnie said: people will work harder, in 
<BR>
their personal or professional life, particularly in that area which they 
<BR>
feel most passionate about, for more rewards of the type which bring them 
<BR>
the most happiness, and money is one of the most important types of these 
<BR>
rewards.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Watched a TV program the other night on the efforts by cleaning and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maintenance staff in Silicon Valley to earn enough to cope with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;explosion in rents and other prices in the area. The poor buggers seemed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be working as hard as humanly possible, two jobs cleaning, mother and kids
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sleeping in the one shockingly expensive room... I guess if you paid them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more they'd work *really* hard.
</EM><BR>
<P>If they were &quot;smart&quot;, yes. I put &quot;smart&quot; in quotes because it is too simple 
<BR>
a word - but if they had value of themselves and their well being, and the 
<BR>
willingness to rationally figure out how to attain goals which would make 
<BR>
them happy, and then to actually ACT on the results, then they would have 
<BR>
more money and more happiness.
<BR>
The simplest thing to do would be to move to someplace with lower rent.
<BR>
Another answer is to get a new job. Find out what you want to do, find out 
<BR>
what skills you need to do that, and attain those skills. Anyone, with rare 
<BR>
exception, is capable of doing this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My hope is that, as we approach the Spike, most of those odious jobs will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disappear, and new ways will be found to assure the people displaced from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work of a decent basic subsistence.
</EM><BR>
<P>The people doing them already have other options of finding quite more then 
<BR>
baic subsistence, as you have. They are just not taking them. Why is this?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;That, luckily, is alleged to be one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the benefits of drextech assemblers - if they arrive on schedule.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So what IS it like in Australia, Damien?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not that different from how it is in the States, actually, Bonnie. :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Will you tell me a bit about censorship in Australia?
<BR>
I have heard of the following three films, among others, being banned:
<BR>
Henry: portrait of a serial killer, Dead man, Romance (later lifted). I 
<BR>
looked them up on imdb.com and they do have an Australian rating, which is 
<BR>
&quot;R&quot;. An R in the US means that if the film shows in a theater, anyone under 
<BR>
the age of 18 has to be accompanied by a parent to see it. What does this 
<BR>
mean in Australia? Perhaps accusations of &quot;banning&quot; a film meant it was 
<BR>
dropped by a distributor, but the article I read on Romance said something 
<BR>
about an exhibition license not being granted, so it couldn't be shown 
<BR>
publicly.
