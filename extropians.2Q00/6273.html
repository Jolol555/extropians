<P>
Hey folks,
<BR>
<P>I wanted more time to think about this, and to talk with Natasha, but
<BR>
neither looks possible. I'll be off email starting I think early
<BR>
tomorrow morning for at least two days, and then might not have regular
<BR>
email for a while.
<BR>
<P>I certainly think no one is above error. If my attempts at careful
<BR>
thought about any of my and others' comments went afoul, I sincerely
<BR>
apologize. I would never intend to wrong anyone. If I wronged Natasha or
<BR>
Max, it was unintentional, and I do indeed deeply apologize to them
<BR>
both.
<BR>
<P>I had a long, painful, but ultimately productive and interesting
<BR>
discussion with friends today about this. Although I remain extremely
<BR>
disturbed and angry about many aspects of these proceedings, something
<BR>
fruitful might be nonetheless be salvaged if we reflect on a number of
<BR>
important issues. One is how this example can be analyzed as a case of
<BR>
clearly (in my view) decent people coming into conflict over relatively
<BR>
little.
<BR>
<P>Far more importantly, and interestingly, is how this can shed light on
<BR>
group dynamics, above all the social psychology of opinion-formation.
<BR>
What needs explanation is: EVERYRONE I talked with who knows me thought
<BR>
I was entirely in the right (while noting that I at times wasn't turning
<BR>
the other cheek where some people might -- but I have strong convictions
<BR>
about that, which I'm also currently questioning), yet virtually
<BR>
EVERYONE on Extropians thought pretty much the opposite.
<BR>
<P>Cultural relativism would be a tempting account. For me, a Platonist
<BR>
(and Hegelian), this would be require a disturbing conclusion: it
<BR>
essentially reduces all that's happened to &quot;The 'Stripes' side and the
<BR>
'Spotted' side are JUST DIFFERENT sides, and that's that.&quot; Since I
<BR>
believe that some difference are not merely lateral (not &quot;just&quot;
<BR>
different), I tend to think that some trans-subcultural norms were
<BR>
violated here. I'm not completely certain what those are, though.
<BR>
<P><P>I should probably quit here. But I wanted to say the following, in order
<BR>
that I might further clarify my reasoning in all this.
<BR>
<P>One thing that might make my -- and perhaps others' --  perspective
<BR>
clear is this. Mike Lorrey made a comment about &quot;killin'&quot; to which I
<BR>
reacted strongly. I think I overreacted, partly because of some
<BR>
frightening anonymous email I was receiving.
<BR>
<P>Others reacted strongly, too. Mike clarified he was not intending to
<BR>
kill anyone, nor inciting anyone to kill anyone.
<BR>
<P>Does he ALSO need to apologize, as a few have suggested?
<BR>
<P>I don't know. If it's reasonable for him to expect that reasonable
<BR>
people should understand his meaning, and not be threatened by it, then
<BR>
perhaps he does not need to apologize at all.
<BR>
<P>Another example. You use the word &quot;niggardly&quot; in front of someone, and
<BR>
he reacts as if you've said something racist. &quot;Okay, you think, maybe he
<BR>
thought you said 'niggerly,' or maybe they simply don't know what the
<BR>
word means. Fair enough.&quot; You explain what you said, and what the word
<BR>
means (along with its etymology, if needed).
<BR>
<P>Now imagine the person continues to respond to you as if you're a
<BR>
racist.
<BR>
<P>Shouldn't you be forgiven any resulting snippiness? Shouldn't you be
<BR>
forgiven the view that this person has irrational ill-will towards you?
<BR>
<P>And shouldn't any nastiness that develops not be attributed SOLELY to
<BR>
you (even if it might be attributable PARTLY to you)?
<BR>
<P>These are very difficult questions. For that reason, I say again: I
<BR>
apologize to Natasha if I've thought through all of this badly --
<BR>
something I most definitely can't fully rule out.
<BR>
<P>Towards the Good,
<BR>
Brian.
