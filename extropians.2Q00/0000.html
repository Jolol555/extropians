<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey cool!  Once in a very blue moon we get an opportunity to have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophical debate which has an actual test case unfolding before our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eyes, so that we might all make predictions and see them fulfilled or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demolished.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We have seen that Lockmart is providing traffic signal cameras to cities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at no up front cost, only a cut of the fines collected.  Under those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumstances
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we will all likely agree on one immediate outcome: the traffic cams will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sprout like daisies after a spring rain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then what will happen?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We all will likely agree that since the ability of the city government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to catch red light runners has suddenly and dramatically increased, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost of each apprehension has decreased, then immediately the city's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coffers will begin to fill with newfound lucre.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But then what will happen?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Zero Powers and I might argue that city governments will be forced to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reduce the fine for red light running!  I predict this.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't. The chance that any given government will give a tax break is
<BR>
inversely proportional to how many bureaucrats that government employs.
<BR>
A governments and unions are like a perfect gas, it expands to fill all
<BR>
vacuums and all containers...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What do you predict?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike Lorrey might predict that someone will figure out a way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defeat the cams.  I agree this will likely happen, in fact I might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; participate in that activity.  It has been years since I have received
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a traffic fine, however I have been known to blow a stop sign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at 80 kph, as can be testified by Jeff Davis who was with me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; last time I did so.  If the city put up an intersection cam I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be toast.  I would have fun figuring out how to defeat the thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>If such cams become widespread, I will definitely get either build them
<BR>
for myself and freinds, or even go into business of making them.
<BR>
<P>You can go two routes: Destructive, or Non-destructive. I prefer the
<BR>
destructive from an altruistic and principled point of view, in that if
<BR>
I burn out the camera for myself, I'm also benefitting all of those
<BR>
drivers who come after me, however, a non-destructive approach will
<BR>
likely cause fewer legal problems dealing with the legalized thugs that
<BR>
call themselves police, and the protection rackets that call themselves
<BR>
governments.
<BR>
<P>The only difference between the two is a matter of power applied to the
<BR>
target. A hand held EMP device is not much more than an ECM/EMI
<BR>
generator on steroids. I built one back in 1990 when I was living in New
<BR>
Mexico, and it was roughly based on a circuit I had gotten out of a book
<BR>
by Information Unlimited of Amherst New Hampshire. It was switched by
<BR>
police radar signals, and was meant to fry the radar sets of any cop who
<BR>
tried to ding me. What I hadn't forseen was that the radar circuitry is
<BR>
built to deal with much higher voltages and currents than an
<BR>
automobile's control chips, so I got the unintended bonus of stopping
<BR>
cops flat. Using such a device on the cameras of Big Brother and All His
<BR>
Buddies (Mr. Zero's system, BBAAHB for short, sounds kinda like a lamb
<BR>
being led to the slaughter ;) ), you would certainly not only be
<BR>
escaping the grip of the velocity tax man (thats all moving violations
<BR>
are really, taxes on your right of free transit), but you would be
<BR>
striking a blow against the potential ubiquity of these systems
<BR>
everywhere.
<BR>
<P>The non-destructive method would use a lower power version that merely
<BR>
causes enough EMI based signal interference in the camera and its
<BR>
trasmission circuits and connections that you basically snow out the
<BR>
video signal. I'm told that you can do the same thing with CCD based
<BR>
cameras using lasers as well, so that might be another method to try,
<BR>
thoug it would take more circuit intelligence to point it at a camera
<BR>
lense and keep it on target, whil the EMI method is an area weapon that
<BR>
has the potential for collateral damage.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Billy Brown might predict that the temptation by the city to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become a miniature tyranny would be too much, and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would keep the fines the same as they were when it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult to bag scofflaws, or perhaps even increase the fines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I predict that if the fines are not substantially reduced, enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people will get mad as hell, decide not to take it anymore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and refuse en mass to pay up.
</EM><BR>
<P>Seattle ran into this problem with its parking problem several years
<BR>
ago. They had something like $2.5 million in unpaid parking tickets
<BR>
backlogged in the system (a good chunk from myself), all because the
<BR>
tree huggin do gooders had conned the city's planning board to purposely
<BR>
plan to have fewer parking spaces and lots, and to put a freeze on the
<BR>
construction of parking garages, because they wanted to force people to
<BR>
use the bus system, and the 'light rail' system they were planning on
<BR>
ambushing the populace with, by making it too annoying to use your car
<BR>
in the city.
<BR>
<P>They even tied your vehicle registration to whether you had paid your
<BR>
parking tickets, which caused anyone who could to register their cars in
<BR>
communities OUTSIDE Seattle (I was registered in Holly, on the Hood
<BR>
Canal, where I spent many or most weekends). Finally they gave up and
<BR>
dropped the fines you had to pay by like 50% and contracted a private
<BR>
company to administer the collections.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This test case is important, for it will be a foretaste of how future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governments might be expected to behave in the future with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increased surveillance abilities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Everybody who is following this thread, think this over and post
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a prediction.  {8-]  spike
