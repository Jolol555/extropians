<P>John the problem with this is that using plutonium and the tools
<BR>
he suggested, the critical mass would not be assembled quickly
<BR>
enough.  Uranium is more forgiving than plutonium in this as I
<BR>
understand it, so they were able to make Little Boy with
<BR>
uranium: two cannons firing plugs of U235 at each other.  This
<BR>
design wouldnt work with plutonium, for it wouldnt assemble the
<BR>
critical mass fast enough, so they had the far more complicated
<BR>
spherical detonation as used in the Fat Man.  Without that, the
<BR>
mass would partially melt and vaporize, and depending on how
<BR>
much Pu you had you might not actually get full detonation.  But
<BR>
you would spread a bunch of plutonium everywhere.  So its good
<BR>
that Ted Taylors bosses realized that sure, a terrorist could
<BR>
definitely raise hell with a glob of plutonium, but there was not good
<BR>
justification for actually demonstrating the fact.
<BR>
<P>Before its all over, some superpower(s) will need to buy up all
<BR>
the Pu that has ever been made, mix it with glass and throw it into
<BR>
the sea.
<BR>
<P>Oh hell, now I remember, I started a big hootnanny last time I
<BR>
mentioned that last part.  So let me make it clearer what I mean.
<BR>
Take the refined Plutonium in the form of a salt, such as plutonium
<BR>
chloride, mix it with molten borosilicate glass, form into rounded
<BR>
cylinders, about 5 meters long, a meter or so in diameter, take
<BR>
them out over the deepest part of the Pacific, shape them so that
<BR>
they sink in a spiral pattern so they cannot be found even if one
<BR>
knows ones position when they were released, roll em off the
<BR>
back of the ship under the watch of Putin, Bush, whoever else cares.
<BR>
<P>They hit the bottom of the sea at 50 meters per second and embed
<BR>
themselves there, 30 meters deep, silt covers it over, no feasible
<BR>
way to ever find or recover them.  Then dont make any more.
<BR>
<P>The biggest problem with this is how to *make sure* no one
<BR>
is making more.  spike
