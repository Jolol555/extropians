If the whole customer base for the insurance industry collapses around the same time revival becomes technically feasible - since both are constrained/enabled by the same factors - then the cryo warehouse customers will be shit out of luck right

when they need it most. No?
<BR>
(end)

<P>I don't think so because insurance premiums are payed out at the time of death and so the two main organizations will have funds that hopefully carry them through.  Both Alcor and CI each have slightly over one million in savings.
<BR>
<P>Now, when you say 'cryo warehouse customers' if you mean the still living who want to be frozen rather then the already suspended, then you have a good point.  The insurance companies would have a hard time surviving such times and I don't know if they would have the deep pockets to cover those already signed with them.  I would like to think that the federal gov't would step in to guarantee things but that may be wishful thinking.  I hope not.  
<BR>
<P>So if someone is old and dying in let's say 2030, they may be out of luck if they are 'on the edge' and cannot afford to be suspended because their policy is no more and yet nano is not yet quite advanced enough to cure their illnesses and extend their life, or it is too expensive for them to take advantage of it since they may be impoverished.          
<BR>
<P>But the elderly and sick in this nation are much better cared for then they used to be in decades past so I would think by then there will have been that much more improvement not just in technology but in social programs.
<BR>
<P>I have friends who cannot afford suspension due to illness that prevents gainful employment and I in their emails I sense at least some of the frustration and sadness they feel.  This is the problem now.
<BR>
<P>sincerely,
