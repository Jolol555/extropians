</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Says who? Perhaps not out there in Hollywood where everyone's life is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for sale all the time, but not elsewhere. People have a right to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; respected and treated considerately wherever they are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry Mike, but even radical libertarians don't argue that anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has a positive entitlement to privacy, or even a right to privacy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anywhere but one's own home.  I have no right to demand that 7-11
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not install cameras if that's what they want to do.  I have no right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to sue a company that sells the address I gave them unless I clearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contracted with them not to.  My home is mine, your home is yours,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and public spaces belong to the public.
</EM><BR>
<P>And who is the public? You and me. In my area, many well known people who are
<BR>
public personalities have homes they go to when they are trying to get away from
<BR>
the paparazzi and the public eye. They come around town, and act and desire to
<BR>
be treated like regulat folks. People like Steve Perry, Merideth Baxter-Birney,
<BR>
Michael J Fox, Michael Shue, Charles Bronson, C Everett Koop, and many others
<BR>
can or have been seen around town living their private lives. Up here, we
<BR>
respect their privacy even when they are out in public, just as we do so with
<BR>
anyone else. If paparazzi or crowds of fans ever showed up, I can guarrantee you
<BR>
that they and their equipment would not have an easy time of it, assuming they
<BR>
don't get arrested first for disturbing the peace. People that go up and give
<BR>
them the fan/celebrity treatment are very much looked down upon.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Privacy, like anything else valuable a person might desire, must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be bargained for, not demanded as an entitlement.  Respect and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consideration, too, have to be earned.  I have no right to demand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that anyone do anything except what is in eir own private interest,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so long as ey does not actively interfere with my doing the same.
</EM><BR>
<P>Some places in the country still grant it as an assumed matter of publicly
<BR>
accepted behavior.  We have words for people who don't think so: flatlander,
<BR>
Masshole, city slicker. Libertarian principles seem to work best in places where
<BR>
people don't take advantage of them to inconvenience or offend others.
