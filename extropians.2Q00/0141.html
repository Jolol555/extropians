<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not surprised that the cradle to grave nanny state is on the forefront of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this. I'm also not surprised that the areas in the US that are jumping on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bandwagon also have similarly high levels of taxation, welfare bureaucracy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; police forces, and general social misery and oppression.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ahem. Taxation in the UK is roughly on a par with the USA -- it's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lowest tax zone in Europe, and one of the lowest tax regimes in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developed world. Welfare bureaucracy is minimal, too. This is the country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where an allegedly left-wing government is privatising the air traffic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control system and the post office, and has privatised most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infrastructure items that are handled by local government in the USA.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was referring to the US on those, but is health care privatized yet? What is the
<BR>
ratio of police to civilians? Sounds to me like the Big Brother ministry is hiring all
<BR>
of those out of work bureaucrats.....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; All this incomplete coverage will do is cause more criminals to commit crimes in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; areas that ARENT under coverage. The crime rate in more rural areas will go up,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people will get whacked out on the moors, etc. You'll see a lot of spouses dying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in 'accidents' during camping trips. Boating 'accidents' will rise, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; criminals will get more circumspect about cleaning up crime scenes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's happened, but not the way you suggest. The first areas to get protected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were central shopping/business areas and middle class suburbs. This pushed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crime out into low-income estates. (There simply isn't enough rural area
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for people to get lost/whacked in -- or a high enough murder rate for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phenomenon to be visible. When I said urbanized, I _meant_ urbanized: 98% of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the population lives in towns/cities, the housing density is comparable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to Japan.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I've heard that the violent crime rates are up some 28% or so over there... So you are
<BR>
saying that rural villages are as tightly packed as the larger towns and cities?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; So what you are saying is that Heathrow is a good place to test my Mr. Mike's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Big Brother Zapper...oh, that could be fun....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Believe me, I've thought about it!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Logical countermeasures:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. Make BBZ's illegal, of course.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;What's this? Oh, its a camping microwave, oh, not that, no, thats a fleadle-o-meter.
<BR>
What does it do? Well, it would be a little hard for a layman like yourself to
<BR>
understand, being a highly technical piece of equipment, but its VERY SENSITIVE
<BR>
equiment, expensive too. You wouldn't want to damage it at all, inspector. I'm here to
<BR>
demonstrate it to various parties in the defence industry. Who? Well I'm not at
<BR>
liberty to say....&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2. Switch from video to film cameras. Microtechnology will probably make this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    possible; use *really tiny* film reels, flying insects to collect the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    cameras and digest/develop/transcieve the film when nobody is around.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    (This isn't real-time surveillance, however.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, now thats fun. Make some mini-orinthopter AI bugs...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3. Fibre optics.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which need to be resolved into digital form somewhere, or else processed in optical
<BR>
circuits. Using a laser system would work wonders to fry such optical circuits.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4. Neural network detection of suspicious behaviour -- lurking with intent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to zap a camera _will_ get you highlighted and questioned by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    police. (This latter is currently in active development by, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    example, London Underground, who want to be able to spot trouble on tube
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    train platforms -- like disturbances, bombs, pick-pockets, or potential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    suicide risks.)
</EM><BR>
<P>So I have a HUD on the inside of my sunglasses, and the BBZ fry-o-lator is disguised
<BR>
as my breifcase. I use cortical scanning to identify targets, the AI of my fryolator
<BR>
focuses the beam on the cameras as I spot new targets, and I simply walk on by....
