<EM>    &gt;I wind up buying Windows because I need to run software that won't run
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;anywhere else ---  even if I think it's junk.
</EM><BR>
<P>I see. So Microsoft gauges consumers by charging too little for their product, and
<BR>
Microsoft products are junk but work better than their competitors because they
<BR>
have secret knowledge of the operating system. What's wrong with this picture?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Software vendors support the most popular platform because it's popular
</EM><BR>
<P>And that surprises you?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Windows is popular because  that's where the software is.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;It's self sustaining
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;deliberately  maintained by Microsoft,
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, they do their best to. I wish them well.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;and insidious.
</EM><BR>
<P>No. People will continue to use Windows until somebody comes up with an
<BR>
operating system that is so wonderful it overcomes the huge disadvantage
<BR>
of not being able to run thousands of popular programs that took millions of
<BR>
man years to write. Is Windows the best operating system on earth? Of course
<BR>
not, but the best system will never, ever, be the most popular one, there's just
<BR>
no way it could be.
<BR>
<P>If it wasn't so destructive this entire anti trust thing would be comic.The government,
<BR>
the government mind you, is trying to tell the most productive area in all of human
<BR>
history how to improve and innovate. A maker of steam powered cement mixers
<BR>
advising INTEL how to modernize their fabrication plants would make more sense.
<BR>
There is a simple test to see If the &quot;Justice&quot; department really is knowledgeable in
<BR>
this area, Microsoft should stop supporting their products for 30 days and refer
<BR>
all inquires to Janet Reno and her lawyers, then let's see what happens.
