and the logic of life...
<BR>
<P>This week I have been quite busy preparing a lecture on models of
<BR>
pattern formation and morphogenesis for a local course (my notes can
<BR>
be found at <A HREF="http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Texts/morph.pdf">http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Texts/morph.pdf</A>). Some of the
<BR>
links I found that I can strongly recommend are 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://waggle.gg.caltech.edu/~kurt/">http://waggle.gg.caltech.edu/~kurt/</A> - Kurt Fleischer has done
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lovely work on simulated development, applied both to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;artificial life and computer graphics.
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Biological pattern formation: How cell talk with each other
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to achieve reproducible pattern formation by Hans
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meinhardt. Great lecture with animations.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/ismap/image.html">http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/ismap/image.html</A> - an old classic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when it comes to reaction-diffusion models.
<BR>
<P>Other fun papers:
<BR>
<P>Kevin Kelly, Nerd Theology, in Technology in Society 21 (1999)
<BR>
387--392
<BR>
<P>Points out that the term god has acquired new meanings in the computer
<BR>
world different from traditional theology. Instead of being a term for
<BR>
supreme being, it denotes a creator entity of a system, something that
<BR>
creates something else out of a state of nothingness. Kelly also
<BR>
points out (as does several of the other papers in this issue) that
<BR>
&quot;'God created man in His own image' is a recursive statement&quot; (from
<BR>
Sussman's Ph.D. thesis) and that there can be chains of entities
<BR>
creating other entities - and that later entities doesn't have to be
<BR>
inferior to their creators.

Payment for Labour in Monkeys
<BR>
Nature 404: 6778 (2000) 
<BR>
<P>It turns out that capuchin monkeys coluntarily share treats with other
<BR>
monkeys that helped to secure them. The researchers put two monkeys in
<BR>
a cage divided by a mesh, and placed bowls with or without food in
<BR>
front of the cage on a plate that could be hauled in by one or both
<BR>
monkeys drawing on rods depnding on the experiment. Each monkey could
<BR>
get just its own bowl of food. It turned out that when there was only
<BR>
food in one of the bowls significantly more food was shared when both
<BR>
monkeys had to work to haul it in than when just one monkey could do
<BR>
the job. It seems that the capuchins have something similar to
<BR>
scorekeeping, gratuity or reciprocity.
<BR>
<P><P>Functional hydrogel structures for autonomous flow control inside
<BR>
microfluidic channels 
<BR>
David J. Beebe, Jeffrey S. Moore, Joseph M. Bauer, Qing Yu, Robin H. Liu,
<BR>
Chelladurai Devadoss &amp; Byung-Ho Jo
<BR>
Nature 404: 6778 (2000) 
<BR>
<P>Hydrogels can respond to many kinds of stimuli, but since they change
<BR>
volume slowly on a macroscopic scale they have not been used
<BR>
extensively. This paper shows that swelling processes on the
<BR>
micrometre scale can be quite fast and used in microfluidic systems by
<BR>
allowing self-regulated flow control. They made gels in exact shapes
<BR>
in microfluid channels using photopatterning to polymerize the gels,
<BR>
and then the exactly shaped gels could be used as valves,
<BR>
&quot;transistors&quot; and a pH separator that let fluid through to two
<BR>
different output channels depending on its acidity.
<BR>
<P><P>Self-organised evolution in a socioeconomic environment
<BR>
A. Arenas, A Diaz-Guilera, C.J. Perez and F. Vega-Redono
<BR>
Physical Review E vol 61: 4 3466--3469
<BR>
<P>A model of technological changes in socioeconomic environments. The
<BR>
idea is that agents get a base payoff depending on their technological
<BR>
level, but decreased by the difference between themselves and their
<BR>
neighbours they have to cooperate with. If this decrease is small,
<BR>
then of course it is favorable to adopt new technologies as soon as
<BR>
they become available and everybody rushes along. If the penalty is
<BR>
large, then the system gets locked in. This paper analyses the
<BR>
behavior of intermediate levels, where self-organised criticality
<BR>
seems to develop (wow! who could have expected that? :-) as agents
<BR>
undergo avalanches when new technology spreads through the system and
<BR>
people adopt. The most interesting result is that there exists an
<BR>
optimal level of penalty due to technological differences, and the
<BR>
advance rate is highest at this point regardless of the size of the
<BR>
system. The paper predicts that there are different regimes of
<BR>
technological evolution depending on the cost of improvement; I guess
<BR>
economists would just say this is obvious (?).
