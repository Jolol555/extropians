</EM><BR>
<P>Silly Lee, tricks are for kids.  In a world where individuals are
<BR>
trillionaires, guys&amp;girls, design and manufacture better girls&amp;guys
<BR>
who satisfy their every whim and craving.  The whole &quot;competition&quot;
<BR>
thing for mates becomes irrelevant.  On the other hand mergers &amp;
<BR>
acquisitions of partners likely to create synergistic offspring
<BR>
becomes an important factor.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The very concept of &quot;enough&quot; is ridiculous, with no place in Extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought.  It is at odds with conservation of mass-energy and the desire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to expand.
</EM><BR>
<P>Horse puckies.  The concept of &quot;enough&quot; always has validity because the
<BR>
required investment at the margin yields diminishing returns.  As I've
<BR>
said with regard to computing &amp; interstellar colonization, it becomes
<BR>
questionable whether &quot;neverending&quot; expansion has any merit because you
<BR>
may be doomed to only &quot;matching&quot; that which has already been achieved.
<BR>
In that situation, computation and longevity at the limits imposed by
<BR>
physical laws (&amp; the longevity of the universe), *is* &quot;enough&quot;.  At
<BR>
that point it becomes &quot;rationally&quot; extropian to expand (grow) only
<BR>
in different (non-physical) realms.

Precisely, you might match them, but you can never exceed them
<BR>
(without creating a superior universe tuned for your optimization).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I recently saw a show on PBS where a researcher who focuses on baboon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social life said that these animals suffer from heart disease and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ailments due to the terrible emotional pressures they experience living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in their troops.  There is not much physical violence but the mere threat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of attack and further loss of social standing eats away at them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constantly(especially the animals with the lesser social standing). 
</EM><BR>
<P>But of course, this is all programmed in at a low level of brain wiring
<BR>
that can be edited by trans-persons.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This reminds me of the Hedonics Imperative website of Donald Pierce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (a favorite of mine).  I would love to live in the world you describe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am personally very tired of my own emotional suffering over failed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; romantic relationships and failure to reach certain goals in my life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The negative thoughts and pain stay with me and is very debilitating.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They strike at me like a red hot needle to the head.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Aha, but imagine a situation in which you sat down with a person and
<BR>
for hours on hours recounted stories of successful relationships,
<BR>
business activities, interesting inventions, etc., etc., where you
<BR>
are literally &quot;The Golden Child&quot;.  The question is what drives you
<BR>
to get out of bed in the morning to go off to yet another day of
<BR>
success and godliness?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I realize you are not advocating people becoming &quot;lotus eaters&quot; but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead having an extremely resilient emotional makeup so they can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; move on, be happy and achieve their goals. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
The emotional makeup is *irrelevant*.  What is relevant is is
<BR>
intellectual seniority (aka enlightenment) vis-a-vis the presence
<BR>
of emotions.  Fundamentally it is the difference between you having
<BR>
emotions and emotions having you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Eliezer, again I must say I look forward to living in that world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a feeling that adversity and pain may not be as easy to escape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as you think though.
</EM><BR>
<P>Suffering and to a lesser degree pain, are to a large degree under self
<BR>
control (ask anyone who has lived through being tortured and declined
<BR>
to &quot;give up the goods&quot;).  Adversity, even that generated by others,
<BR>
can be viewed as a disincentive, the way of the world or a learning
<BR>
opportunity (again at the viewer's choice).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm experiencing some serious pain right now!  Missing the Alcor Life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extension Conference makes me feel sick to the core.  I only have half
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the money I needed to attend saved up.  It would have cost me one grand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I have half that in the bank.  I try to tell myself there will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other conferences but I feel sick about it still.  The transcripts/videos
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of these conferences never seem to be made available to the public either.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Really, John, that seems silly.  There have to be millions of opportunities
<BR>
for various things that you miss each day and it hardly seems healthy
<BR>
to worry about that.  The Alcor conference is a nice opportunity to
<BR>
schmooze with people who have your perspective (and is therefore
<BR>
emotionally useful), but you would gain more real insight by spending
<BR>
an equivalant amount of time reading related journal articles.
<BR>
Perhaps from the perspective of someone who has not had the
<BR>
opportunities to attend such forums, it seems like a great loss.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From the perspective of someone who has attended 50 or more
</EM><BR>
similar conferences in the last 10 years, I can say they do
<BR>
get old.  (For various reasons, primarily related to time
<BR>
constraints I will not be at the Alcor conference.)
<BR>
<P>Fundamentally, one has to separate the desirable stuff from the
<BR>
essential stuff.  With regard to cryonics, that comes down to the
<BR>
simple fact of whether or not you are signed up for suspension.
<BR>
