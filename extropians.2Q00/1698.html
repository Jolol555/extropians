If you magically introduced one of these aircars for a price of about
<BR>
$20,000 today, with a production capacity of a million units a year, GM, 
<BR>
Ford, Toyota, Daimler Chrysler, et al would all be declaring bankruptcy in 
<BR>
short order
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Unless of course, they had all at least partially refitted their factories 
<BR>
to PRODUCE aircars!  Then those factories would be busier then ever.  Hans 
<BR>
Moller has been trying very hard to get a big auto maker to partner with him 
<BR>
so he can have the resources necessary to make the aircar practical and 
<BR>
affordable but he has had no takers.  When trying to do this in the 
<BR>
aerospace sector a Boeing v.p. told him &quot;we just don't see a large market 
<BR>
for aircars!&quot; lol!!
<BR>
<P>I will say that Moller has kept on pushing back the date of his flight 
<BR>
testing for his latest four-seater aircar design which is the one he wants 
<BR>
to mass produce.  This is not a good signal to potential investors out there 
<BR>
but at least he is doing his best to not rush things and really get botched 
<BR>
results.

Good! A company stupid enough to be ignorant of advances in its own industry 
<BR>
and ignores such a historic opportunity should go bankrupt; they're just too 
<BR>
dumb to live.

(end)
<BR>
<P>I agree!  It will be very interesting to see how everyone jumps on the 
<BR>
bandwagon when the aircar is shown to be practical and is being mass 
<BR>
produced by one of the giants of auto or aerospace manufacturing.
<BR>
<P>Mike lorrey continued:
<BR>
and you'd have millions of unionized autoworkers out on the streets
<BR>
unemployed.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Nope, they would be most likely building aircars!
<BR>
<P>John Clarke asked:
<BR>
Then who is making all those aircars?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Exactly!  I dream of owning an aircar.  My fondest wishes are that Hans 
<BR>
Moller is successful in making his craft airworthy and practical.  The world 
<BR>
is still very vast and travel generally expensive(especially when living in 
<BR>
Alaska).  I want places like L.A. and Vegas to be within my area of 
<BR>
visitation just like Valdez is now!
<BR>
