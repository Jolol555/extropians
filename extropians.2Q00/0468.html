Re: extropy definitions

<P><EM>&gt; Does extropy mean that we can increase information (inside)

<EM>&gt; without, at the same time, increase the entropy (outside)? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Has this term (extropy) some softer meaning?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the definitions should all be on the extropy web site
<BR>
(www.extropy.org, see the Extropian Principles and FAQ).
<BR>
<P>But my short answer would be that since you can't violate the laws
<BR>
of thermodynamics, any increased organization of information
<BR>
(i.e. our conscious directed evolution of ourselves and a more
<BR>
highly organized, sophisticated, creative society, etc.) must
<BR>
come at the expense of creating greater disorder in the universe
<BR>
as a whole.  However, since the universe is &quot;running down&quot;
<BR>
*anyway*, you could view our intervention(s) as simply siphoning
<BR>
off some of the energy that would only go to waste anyway.
<BR>
Dyson and Kardashev were among the first to point out that all the
<BR>
energy that stars radiate away into space is really quite a waste.
<BR>
<P>It is interesting to consider that shifting from a random evolutionary
<BR>
process (e.g. nature &amp; natural selection), to a consciously directed
<BR>
self-evolved process, may in fact more efficiently use the
<BR>
available energy.  That is because the random process has to
<BR>
produce a lot of real failures to come up with some successes.
<BR>
At least with self-directed conscious evolution we are more
<BR>
likely to have those failures be of a &quot;virtual&quot; type (since
<BR>
most of our designs are now tested in virtual universes).
<BR>
Virtual failures are likely to be much cheaper than real failures.
<BR>
[Hans Moravec discusses this to some extent in his recent Robots book.]
<BR>
<P>Perhaps some of the rocket engineers on the list can elaborate... :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I need some help!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I'm a new transhuman being (from Italy)!

<P>Hmmmm, a transhuman world with 10,000 copies of Roberto Bellini,
<BR>
now isn't that an interesting picture... :-)
