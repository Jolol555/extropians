<P>Well, strategically, after the movie ended, then there are still an unknown
<BR>
number of agents with unknown capacity to create more, and control
<BR>
mechanisms unknown to the humans for the rogue machines at large, the human
<BR>
farm, and the matrix itself, thus the strategy is to identify these things
<BR>
and others about the rogue machines and mobilize against them.  A key would
<BR>
be to establish gateways to the Matrix such that a very much larger number
<BR>
of humans be informed and as they would freed.
<BR>
<P>The Matrix itself would largely be there to stay.  In a way, it is like the
<BR>
coffin hotels in Japan.  For whatever period of time you care, you get
<BR>
coccooned and live in the matrix.  The key is the ability to leave it and
<BR>
the recognition of it.  For example, to build spaceships to colonize, it is
<BR>
required to have some level of interaction with the real world, although in
<BR>
large part as soon as the rogue AIs are converted back to beneficiality then
<BR>
their machineries are turned back towards human causes as they always have
<BR>
been.  For the time being it would be the only way to support that large
<BR>
population.
<BR>
<P>The Earth in the movie is in a state of post-apocalyptic likely nuclear
<BR>
winter, which was caused by the humans to remove solar power from the
<BR>
machines, according to Morpheus.  That would have to be fixed to enable
<BR>
humans to live on the face of the planet generally again.
<BR>
<P>Having free rein in the Matrix would be quite convenient within it.  It is a
<BR>
question as to what laws of the Matrix are immutable to participants.  Leaps
<BR>
across chasms and acrobatics aside, gravity appears to be in place, and most
<BR>
mechanics.  There were no surreal sectors shown.  At the end of the movie
<BR>
Neo flies off unaided.  He is a special case, but it is a question of
<BR>
whether this skillset may be imbued to others.
<BR>
<P>At issue is the level of separation between the Matrix and the AI system.
<BR>
Smith notes desire to be away form the Matrix, so perhaps the purely
<BR>
mechanical system is alien to the Matrix which is formed from human throught
<BR>
processes.
<BR>
<P>They are certainly many scenes in the movie that do not correspond to hard
<BR>
science, nor to precedence within the movie.  When Trinity shoots the agent
<BR>
on the roof, she says &quot;dodge this&quot;, why does he not?  Well that it did not.
<BR>
<P>Besides Morpheus' ship Nebuchadnezzar other ships are mentioned, none seen,
<BR>
as is a human city near the center of the Earth, Zion, where the naturally
<BR>
born humans Tank and Dozer were born.
<BR>
<P>Well, it is a good movie.
<BR>
<P>So this has reopened the questions of &quot;are we in a simulation now&quot; etcetera,
<BR>
which is an extension of the objectivist school which has tenets of
<BR>
questioning the existence of anything besides the monad or something.
<BR>
<P>Here's something different, consider a theory T.  Say that there is a set of
<BR>
theories T_omega that contains every single permutation of axioms that is a
<BR>
consistent theory.  At least one of them is reality.
<BR>
<P>Have a nice day
