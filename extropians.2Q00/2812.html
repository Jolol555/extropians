<P>
I left work at noon today to attend Sasha's wake in Boston at 2 pm. The
<BR>
weather has been absolutely rotten since he died on monday, and there
<BR>
were lightning storms and torrential rains all the way down. It seemed
<BR>
as though the whole world was mourning its loss. I had thought that
<BR>
Sasha had tried to call me monday, because there had been some 'hangup'
<BR>
type messages on my voicemail, so i was feeling a bit guilty about not
<BR>
being there for the phone, but it turns out it was just the census
<BR>
weenie trying to find out why I put 'human' down for my race on the
<BR>
census form....no kidding.
<BR>
<P>Thanks to the directions I got from the mapping software on the netscape
<BR>
website, I arrived right on time. People were filing in. I saw Vanessa
<BR>
Hughes as we were waiting to register in the guest book. Eugene was
<BR>
handling everything quite well, it seemed. He has certainly grown up
<BR>
quite a bit in the last few years. He reminded me of how well the
<BR>
Windsor princes handled their mothers death in public. I let him know
<BR>
that Simon Levy and Roderick Carder-Russell couldn't make it, but that
<BR>
they asked me to give their condolences. 
<BR>
<P>Julia Chislenko got up when everyone had been seated, and had trouble
<BR>
talking, so she asked anyone who wanted to to come up and speak.
<BR>
Somewhere around a dozen people took turns talking, each seemed to be
<BR>
from a different facet of his life, from the extropians and other
<BR>
transhumanists, from his past life in Russia, from his Circle group and
<BR>
his dancing freinds, to some of the guys from 100x, and a few of his
<BR>
past girlfreinds. Steve Witham was there and spoke well of him and our
<BR>
shared dreams and goals, and what sort of a person he was to Steve.
<BR>
<P>Kathryn Aegis rode the train for 10 hours to come up from Washington,
<BR>
and spoke as well about their relationship and projects they had worked
<BR>
on. I was really happy she came, though we had never met in person, I've
<BR>
known her longer than I've known Sasha, from the old transhumanim list.
<BR>
<P>Steve, Kathryn, I, and several other people all went out for dinner
<BR>
afterward, chatted about Sasha and basically had your typical
<BR>
extropian/transhumanist type discussion. One guy was a dancing freind of
<BR>
Sasha's and didn't know much about this side of him, but seemed very
<BR>
fascinated with many of the ideas.
<BR>
<P>I wanted to speak at the wake as well, but I was afraid to, because I
<BR>
was worried that my anger at his death would come through, as I had just
<BR>
learned of the circumstances of his death from Eugene. GOD   DAMN    IT.
<BR>
Why? Things were going so well. When I last saw him at 100x a couple
<BR>
weeks ago when I went down for an interview, he was walking a few inches
<BR>
off the carpet, grinning like a kid in the candy shop. &quot;I'm getting paid
<BR>
to do this?!!!&quot; he exclaimed in joy and still some disbelief in his good
<BR>
fortune. &quot;This is going to be so great Mike, we can get the projects
<BR>
we've been talking about done and get them backed properly,&quot; he told me.
<BR>
<P>Sasha was apparently a much more sensitive person than he ever let on
<BR>
with me. On a few rare occasions he would act discouraged that things
<BR>
weren't coming together like he had hoped, or was bummed because some
<BR>
deal had fallen through. He and I once shared the same frustration at
<BR>
finding someone special, that shared all of his varied interests. How
<BR>
can you find a Rennaisance woman for a renaissance man like Sasha? They
<BR>
don't grow on trees.
<BR>
<P>But things seemed to be going so well. One good thing to come out of
<BR>
this is that Steve Witham and myself have both decided to sign up with
<BR>
Alcor. The future will be less bright without Sasha around, but, dammit,
<BR>
I hope that as many as possible of our freinds in extropy and elsewhere
<BR>
sign up. This experience reminds me of a talk I had with my 88 year old
<BR>
grandmother this past year. She was running out of freinds, she
<BR>
said,&quot;I'm burying everyone I know, I don't know what I'm going to do
<BR>
with everyone gone.&quot; This is the grandmother who golfs 18 holes three
<BR>
times a week and goes dancing several times a week as well, who thinks
<BR>
nothing of driving alone from Florida to Nashua, NH by herself in two
<BR>
days. My other two living grandparents are each two years younger than
<BR>
she, and they are just sitting around waiting to die.
<BR>
<P>This is not what life is supposed to be about, dammit. The next wake I
<BR>
attend for an extropian had better the hell involve a bottle of liquid
<BR>
nitrogen. I want to say &quot;See you sometime again.&quot; rather than &quot;good bye
<BR>
forever my freind.&quot;
<BR>
