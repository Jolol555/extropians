<P><EM>&gt; Saying that lawyers have a &quot;monopoly&quot; on the practice of law is like saying 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that licensed drivers have a monopoly on driving.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so.  First, the &quot;barriers to entry&quot; for getting a driver's 
<BR>
license are pretty low (all you have to do is drive on the freeway to see 
<BR>
this :-).  Second, lots of people drive without licenses.  So long as you're 
<BR>
careful, you'll never be caught.
<BR>
<P>I have pretty mixed feelings about what I believe is in fact a state-backed 
<BR>
monopoly - i.e. the professional bar.  On the one hand, I think state-backed 
<BR>
monopolies are bad.  On the other, allowing just anybody to hold themselves 
<BR>
out as an attorney would seriously corrode the rule of law.  Consider that 
<BR>
one of the fundamental values underpinning the rule of law is that people 
<BR>
must be bound by the judicial process.  Mandating some minimal certification 
<BR>
for attorneys enhances this value, since it makes it more fair to bind 
<BR>
someone who is represented by counsel.  Of course, you have to have 
<BR>
exceptions, which the post-Gideon &quot;ineffective counsel&quot; jurisprudence does.  
<BR>
(BTW, Henry Fonda's movie, &quot;Gideon's Trumpet&quot;, is very high on my all-time 
<BR>
&quot;best law movies ever&quot; - along with Fonda's &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, Spencer Tracy's 
<BR>
&quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; and Jimmy Stewart's &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot;.)
<BR>
<P>The system we now have evolved from each court or court system regulating its 
<BR>
own bar, with essentially local &quot;legal elders&quot; administering bar examinations 
<BR>
on behalf of the courts in a pretty decentralized fashion.  Criteria for 
<BR>
taking the exam were highly flexible and consisted primarily of sponsorship 
<BR>
by a known and respected member of the bar.  One of the founders of my firm 
<BR>
didn't attend law school, but &quot;read law&quot; in the old fashioned way as a 
<BR>
working apprentice in the profession under this system.  He must have done 
<BR>
well, since he was Jesse Jones' personal attorney (Jones going on to own a 
<BR>
good chunk of coastal Texas, create one of the largest charitable foundations 
<BR>
in the world and become Secretary of Commerce).
<BR>
<P>Likewise, before the unification of the old diverse subject-matter court 
<BR>
systems, the various lines of judicial authority maintained their own 
<BR>
idiosyncratic bar admission and regulatory systems.  The law courts, chancery 
<BR>
courts and admiralty boards each had separate bars, with specialized criteria 
<BR>
for admission, in many places in the Anglosphere well into this century.  It 
<BR>
was a rare lawyer indeed who was both a proctor in admiralty and an attorney 
<BR>
at law before 1900, for instance.
<BR>
<P>The old system worked fairly well and could be a model for a more flexible 
<BR>
&quot;polycentric&quot; professional bar.  Getting to such a result would require us to 
<BR>
let go of the &quot;stasist&quot; paradigm of state-centered centralization that 
<BR>
characterized much of the legal-systemic thinking of the 20th century.  But I 
<BR>
don't think I could ever support a complete &quot;deprofessionalization&quot; of the 
<BR>
practice of law.  A life in the law is just that, and can't be something one 
<BR>
does without a fairly deep personal commitment, at least not without doing a 
<BR>
grave disservice to anyone who would look to you for help in navigating the 
<BR>
web of legal responsibility.
