<EM>&gt; From: Max More &lt;<A HREF="mailto:max@maxmore.com?Subject=RE:%20Sasha%20did%20not%20have%20cryonics%20arrangements&In-Reply-To=&lt;392670EB@MailAndNews.com&gt;">max@maxmore.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Many people have asked me whether Sasha had arrangements for cryonics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspension. From my own knowledge and by checking with others who knew him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well, I am fairly certainly that he never made suspension arrangements.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I feel rotten in delivering this additional blow, but it seems right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; convey this to everyone who has shown such an outpouring of feeling.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clearly Sasha was loved and respected widely. The very least we can do is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to preserve his web-based thoughts (preferably in multiple places).
</EM><BR>
<P>...and more importantly, we should remember that though we may
<BR>
talk of godhood, we're still trapped in feeble, mortal fleshbodies.
<BR>
Accidents and disease can strike you down at any moment, and
<BR>
when you die your only chance is cryonic preservation. Period.
<BR>
It's an eternal shame that Sasha, one of the finest minds on 
<BR>
this list and otherwise an example to all, didn't heed what is probably 
<BR>
transhumanism's single most important advice: sign up for cryonic 
<BR>
suspension. Hopefully others will learn from this incident so that his 
<BR>
death wasn't _completely_ in vain.
