<P>Desktop Biofactories? New Microrobots Might Manipulate Single Cells, Science 
<BR>
Authors Report 
<BR>
<P>Tiny, submersible robots may suggest a single-cell retrieval system, desktop 
<BR>
biofactories, or even tools for minimally invasive surgery, according to a 30 
<BR>
June report in the international journal, Science. 
<BR>
At 670 micrometers tall and 170 to 240 micrometers wide, the new microrobots 
<BR>
are shorter than this hyphen--and no wider than the following period. Unlike 
<BR>
many previous designs, the Swedish-made microrobots can function in salty 
<BR>
broths, blood, urine, cell-culture medium and other liquids, suggesting a 
<BR>
host of biotechnology uses. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Being able to manipulate many individual cells at the same time is becoming 
<BR>
increasingly important for genomics, proteomics, and metabolic research,&quot; 
<BR>
says Edwin W.H. Jager, a graduate student at Sweden's Linköpings Universitet 
<BR>
and lead author of the Science paper. &quot;We think that these microrobots would 
<BR>
be helpful for fundamental studies, or for manufacturing other small devices, 
<BR>
especially if we set up arrays of them.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The robot's miniature hand might someday pluck single cells, bacteria, 
<BR>
multi-cellular organisms and other biological entities from a sample, then 
<BR>
transfer them to an analysis station. Coupled with a multisensor area, the 
<BR>
microrobots also may suggest lab-on-a-chip designs, or &quot;factory-on-a-desk&quot; 
<BR>
tools, programmed to assemble various microstructures, say coauthors Olle 
<BR>
Inganäs and Ingemar Lundström, faculty members at Linköpings Universitet. 
<BR>
Positioned at the end of a catheter, the polymer-and-gold microrobots might 
<BR>
increase the range of surgeons, too. 
<BR>
<P>How do the microrobots work? Imagine a human hand, opening and closing. 
<BR>
Similarly, conducting polymers such as polypyrrole can be forced to shrink 
<BR>
and swell on command. The researchers combine layers of gold and polypyrrole, 
<BR>
then use electricity to manipulate contractions of the polymer. 
<BR>
<P>To make the microrobot grab a glass bead, for instance, researchers plump up 
<BR>
the polymer by drawing positively charged ions, called cations, away from an 
<BR>
electrolyte solution and into the material. Shrinking the polymer is as easy 
<BR>
as applying a positive charge to the gold, which oxidizes the polypyrrole and 
<BR>
causes cations to flee. 
<BR>
<P>Previous microrobots have included electronic devices featuring rods and 
<BR>
levers, artificial flying insects made of polysilicon, and a walking silicon 
<BR>
microrobot. But, &quot;none of these operate in water, and would not be suitable 
<BR>
as microactuators for the manipulation of cells,&quot; Jager notes. Whenever pure 
<BR>
silicon is exposed, he explains, it oxidizes and stops working. In the new 
<BR>
design, silicon provides a skeletal framework, which is encased and protected 
<BR>
by gold and polypyrrole &quot;micromuscles.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The Swedish team's invention was etched into part of a four-inch silicon 
<BR>
wafer, which allowed them to create separate gold-and-polypyrrole electrodes 
<BR>
for each joint in a robotic arm. From one-fourth of a single wafer, they 
<BR>
created 140 microrobots with an elbow, a wrist, a hand, and two to four 
<BR>
fingers. 
<BR>
<P>The team used photolithography to pattern the titanium-coated silicon. Next, 
<BR>
using a patterned chromium layer as a kind of glue, they added a thin layer 
<BR>
of gold to the template. More etching defined individual electrodes on the 
<BR>
silicon. This step was followed by a rigid material called BCB 
<BR>
(Benzocyclobutene, or Cyclotene), which provided a framework for the 
<BR>
electrodes. Finally, the polypyrrole was deposited over the gold. After a 
<BR>
final etching step, the robots were released and ready for action. 
<BR>
<P>Submerged in an electrolyte solution, several robots were wired to an 
<BR>
electrical source and videotaped as they as hoisted a glass bead. Much like 
<BR>
puppeteers pulling one string or another, the researchers stimulated the 
<BR>
microrobots' fingers, wrists and elbows by applying a charge to specific 
<BR>
joints. To open and close the microrobots' hand, for example, they 
<BR>
successively applied positive and negative potentials. 
<BR>
<P>The microrobots successfully moved a bead up to 250 micrometers. They also 
<BR>
hoisted beads 270 micrometers, from one miniature conveyor belt or &quot;track&quot; to 
<BR>
another, proving their potential as tiny factory workers. Treated with 
<BR>
adhesion molecules, the robot's fingers might select particular cells or 
<BR>
bacteria from a sample, or they might support surgical procedures. In 
<BR>
addition, the Science authors say, an array of microrobots could 
<BR>
simultaneously handle many cells. 
<BR>

<BR>
Foundation for Strategic Research and the Swedish Research Council for 
<BR>
Engineering Sciences.
