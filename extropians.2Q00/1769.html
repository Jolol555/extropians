</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why? I've read lots of theories claiming telomeres in mice are differently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regulated than in humans (which appears to be likely) but I'm ignorant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regarding cows' telomeres. You just base your opinion on the fact that cows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live less than us or do you know something I don't?
</EM><BR>
<P>To start with mice have longer telomeres than humans.  So their
<BR>
shortening with cell division presumably does not impact much
<BR>
on their rate of aging.  The longer telomeres *may* explain why
<BR>
they get cancer after only 2-3 years with many fewer cell
<BR>
divisions (lower mass).
<BR>
<P>The original &quot;proto-cell&quot; had to have telomerase on (at some point)
<BR>
to keep the telomeres intact from generation to generation.  The original
<BR>
proto-mammals it is believed were small (more like mice), so they
<BR>
probably had short lifespans (almost all small animals do) and like
<BR>
mice had little need for anti-cancer programs.  Depending on the size
<BR>
and longevity of the mammal that was the common ancestor of cows, sheep
<BR>
and humans would determine how much of the telomere regulation program
<BR>
we share.  My suspicion would be that that ancestor would be toward
<BR>
the small size for mammals, so there is likely to be a fair amount of
<BR>
divergence between the telomere regulation programs.
<BR>
<P>Since most cows and sheep are slaughtered before they get old there
<BR>
would be little selection for anti-cancer programs in their genomes.
<BR>
Probably some research would need to be done on their ancestors to
<BR>
determine what selection effects there might have been in their
<BR>
environments, but since they are herbivores, I suspect the carnivores
<BR>
would be taking them out at the earliest sign of &quot;aging&quot; and that
<BR>
would seem to suggest little opportunity for anti-cancer programs
<BR>
to get selected.
<BR>
<P>Humans, elephants and whales on the other hand all go to the top
<BR>
of their environmental niches allowing nature to push on their
<BR>
longevity to maximize reproduction.  That implies a very careful
<BR>
tuning of the anti-cancer program so cancer doesn't kill you before
<BR>
all of the other factors.  As Cutler, Perls, etc. have pointed out to
<BR>
me, the interesting thing about the oldest-old is their ability
<BR>
to age &quot;uniformly&quot;.  In humans the collection of anti-aging programs
<BR>
have been pushed farther than most other species.
<BR>
<P>I do not doubt that sheep and to a greater extent cows, may have
<BR>
some telomere related anti-cancer/pro-longevity balancing occuring
<BR>
but I doubt it is as sophisticated as the program in the other species
<BR>
I've mentioned.  We will know much more when the genomes are done
<BR>
and we can compare the regulatory regions for the genes involved
<BR>
in controlling telomere length.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Telomere length is fundamentally an anti-cancer control mechanism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps but I won't bet my money on it yet (and although that might be true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in humans, it's unlikely to be the case in many other species such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lobsters or even sharks). 
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps I should have said &quot;Telomere length in humans&quot;.
<BR>
As you point out, cross-species comparisons are going to be a swamp.
<BR>
Sharks are a classic case (very old, very different evolutionary path)
<BR>
where the anti-cancer program is likely to be very different.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cloning experiments are useful for they contradict in many ways the theory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of DNA accumulating mutations (this particular experiment doesn't do that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because the cells were &quot;aged&quot; in vitro after being taken from a fetus but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other experiments do just that, despite the data no being conclusive).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  With the cloning success rates so low, you have no idea
<BR>
whether the failures are due to scientific methodology or whether
<BR>
you have a situation where only 5% of the cells contain an &quot;intact&quot;
<BR>
developmental program.
<BR>
<P>In adult organisms, there is going to be *no* selection against mutations
<BR>
accumulating in the developmental genes that have already done their
<BR>
job and have been turned off.  You are only going to select for
<BR>
the lack of mutations in housekeeping genes.  All the cells that
<BR>
have accumulated fatal errors in their housekeeping genes have
<BR>
presumably died.
<BR>
<P>The cloning experiments *may* be saying something very interesting
<BR>
about the DNA mutation theory.  The only way I can see to shed some
<BR>
light on this will be when we have good DNA polymorphism chips
<BR>
that can allow you to measure the &quot;noise&quot; (mutation) level in the genome.
<BR>
Then you take 2000 cells, split them, measure the effective mutation
<BR>
level in each &quot;clone&quot; at the same time you try to make an organism
<BR>
out of them.  If the mutation rate (genome noise level) is lower
<BR>
in those clones that produce successful organisms, then you
<BR>
have a smoking gun for the DNA mutation accumulation theory.
