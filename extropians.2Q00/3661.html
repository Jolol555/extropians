<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; The choice is indeed very difficult, if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; don't fall for the idiotic and dangerous idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; that voting for someone with no chance of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; winning achieves anything positive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hmm. A vote is an expression of preference.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I choose to express my preference for a minority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; candidate, that preference is duly recorded and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reported, and the total of these votes may well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; influence the particular positions of major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; candidates in the future.  I would consider this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a &quot;positive&quot; result, while I would consider no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one ever hearing my real opinions because I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; chose to lie about them to be one of the unheard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; masses who voted for a popular candidate to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;negative&quot; result.  Do you have a different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; evaluation of those outcomes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Indeed, not only do I have a different evaluation of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outcomes of the two options you mention, but I believe these are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not the only two that should be considered.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's so far very little evidence that the small number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who have voted for a third party candidate in a U.S.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presidential election have altered the actual policies of any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the major candidates, at least in recent times. It's altered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rhetoric to some degree, sure, but very little else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I think the Libertarian party has been quite successful in
<BR>
acting as a 'third way' source of ideas to counter the seeming polarity
<BR>
of the fundamentalists versus the big gummint liberals. A large number
<BR>
of the ideas in the Republican Revolution started as Libertarian Party
<BR>
ideas, then you also have pot legalization as well. Seeing the LP
<BR>
candidate say on national TV during the campaign give a logical argument
<BR>
why the drug war was dumb and pot should be legalized was I think the
<BR>
first time that idea made prime time since the 70's. School vouchers
<BR>
started as an LP idea as well. Ron Paul is the only LP candidate to make
<BR>
it to national office, and that was riding on the Republican ticket, but
<BR>
he still made it. Note that the conservative agenda has little to do
<BR>
with religion these days. Most republicans have gotten pretty tired of
<BR>
the abortion issue costing them the election, even when the Supreme
<BR>
Court has basically sent the issue to the states anyways.
