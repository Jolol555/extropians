<P><EM>&gt; &gt; And so?  Your claim, remember, was that &quot;the US has never brought an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anti-trust suit against a foreign company.&quot;  I have no idea where you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that from, but I was merely pointing out that that is simply not even 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;close
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to being true.  The Alcoa case is not the only case where this happened. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is the landmark case where Judge Learned Hand first held that the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sherman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Act can be used against a foreign company, even if the claimed acts all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; occurred outside the US border.  There have been *many* others since 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You claim Alcoa is a foreign company. This is not so, it is an american
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;company.
</EM><BR>
<P>The following quote comes from the more recent case of United States v. 
<BR>
Nippon Paper Industries Co., 109 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 03/17/1997) 109 F.3d 1, 
<BR>
1997.C01.103:
<BR>
<P>&quot;In United States v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945) 
<BR>
(Alcoa), the Second Circuit, sitting as a court of last resort, see 15 
<BR>
U.S.C. Section(s) 29 (authorizing designation of a court of appeals as a 
<BR>
court of last resort for certain antitrust cases), mulled a civil action 
<BR>
brought under Section One against a Canadian corporation for acts committed 
<BR>
entirely abroad which, the government averred, had produced substantial 
<BR>
anticompetitive effects within the United States. The Alcoa court read 
<BR>
American Banana narrowly; that case, Judge Learned Hand wrote, stood only 
<BR>
for the principle that &quot;[w]e should not impute to Congress an intent to 
<BR>
punish all whom its courts can catch, for conduct which has no consequences 
<BR>
within the United States.&quot; Id. at 443. But a sovereign ordinarily can impose 
<BR>
liability for conduct outside its borders that produces consequences within 
<BR>
them, and while considerations of comity argue against applying Section One 
<BR>
to situations in which no effect within the United States has been shown -- 
<BR>
the American Banana scenario -- the statute, properly interpreted, does 
<BR>
proscribe extraterritorial acts which were &quot;intended to affect imports [to 
<BR>
the United States] and did affect them.&quot; Id. at 444. On the facts of Alcoa, 
<BR>
therefore, the presumption against extraterritoriality had been overcome, 
<BR>
and the Sherman Act had been violated. See id. at 444-45.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Judge Learned Hand???? Is that a real name?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; All of which goes back to the original argument (getting back somewhat 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the thread subject) that moving to a foreign state would not do MS any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in terms of their antitrust problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Which you have yet to prove.
</EM><BR>
<P>See above.
