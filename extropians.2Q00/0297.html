<P>A SIN TO DEPORT ELIAN
<BR>
Ayn Rand Heir Asserts Elian's Right to Remain in U.S.
<BR>
<P>By Leonard Peikoff
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a sin to deport Elian Gonzalez. To send a child to
<BR>
rot in the prison of
<BR>
Cuba for the alleged sake of his own well-being is criminal hypocrisy.
<BR>
To send him there in
<BR>
order to preserve his father's rights is absurdity, since there are no
<BR>
parental or other rights
<BR>
in Cuba. To send him there because &quot;He needs a father, no matter what,&quot;
<BR>
is a mindless bromide.
<BR>
Does he need a father who has no choice but to watch his son being
<BR>
broken in mind and starved
<BR>
in body?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liberals I know want Elian deported because they regard the
<BR>
difference between the
<BR>
United States and Cuba as &quot;merely a difference of political opinion,&quot;
<BR>
merely a subjective
<BR>
matter of &quot;how you define freedom.&quot; In other words, being relativists
<BR>
who are statists
<BR>
themselves, they find nothing objectively wrong with Cuba. And even if
<BR>
Cuba does have flaws,
<BR>
some of them say, so do Haiti and many other underdeveloped countries
<BR>
from which people seek to
<BR>
emigrate. So why the fuss about Elian? Isn't it discrimination in favor
<BR>
of Cubans?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument evades the difference between slavery and poverty.
<BR>
<P>True, a proper
<BR>
immigration policy should not favor Cubans; but it should discriminate
<BR>
nevertheless--in favor
<BR>
of the most deserving cases from every country. I mean the pathetically
<BR>
small trickle of
<BR>
escapees from real dictatorships--Communist, Nazi, or other--who manage
<BR>
somehow to claw their
<BR>
way to our border. Can we morally shrug off victims such as these and
<BR>
send them home to the
<BR>
Secret Police to &quot;wait in line&quot; behind barbed wire? In Ayn Rand's words,
<BR>
<P>the criteria of
<BR>
&quot;dictatorship&quot; in this context are: &quot;one-party rule--executions . . .
<BR>
for political
<BR>
offenses--the nationalization or expropriation of private property--and
<BR>
censorship.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Cubans in Miami understand firsthand these insignia of
<BR>
dictatorship; they
<BR>
recognize Elian's plight. But, though impassioned, they are hard-pressed
<BR>
<P>to defend him in
<BR>
convincing terms. Many of them, who exalt &quot;family values,&quot; sound
<BR>
insincere in seeking to
<BR>
separate a son from his father. Besides, if religion is their final
<BR>
intellectual recourse, as
<BR>
it is for most conservatives, Cuban or otherwise, how persuasive a case
<BR>
can they make in any
<BR>
debate? To neutral observers who seek logical answers to the Elian
<BR>
controversy, mystic visions
<BR>
are not persuasive; they are irrelevant. What Elian desperately needs on
<BR>
<P>his side is not a
<BR>
defender of the faith, but an exponent of reason.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayn Rand taught me philosophy for 30 years. She herself had fled
<BR>
<P>Soviet Russia in the
<BR>
'20s, and she knew what life was like there. The opposite of slavery,
<BR>
she taught, is not merely
<BR>
freedom of action, but above all its root, the freedom of thought. You
<BR>
cannot be free, she
<BR>
said, unless your mind is free, free to come to and express its own
<BR>
conclusions without threat
<BR>
or coercion, free to pursue its own profit and happiness, and free to
<BR>
keep the wealth its own
<BR>
efforts have created.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she taught me, in essence, was that, despite all their
<BR>
detractors, the
<BR>
Enlightenment and the Founding Fathers were right; and that one must
<BR>
defend the independence of
<BR>
the individual, the inalienable rights of man, and the supremacy of
<BR>
reason against all comers,
<BR>
whether &quot;friend&quot; or enemy, kin or outsider, relativist or mystic, state
<BR>
or church. A century
<BR>
and a half ago, when these ideas were still the conventional wisdom in
<BR>
the U.S., Elian would
<BR>
have provoked no controversy; he would have been welcomed here eagerly.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty years ago, by contrast, when I first met her, Ayn Rand was
<BR>
<P>the only prominent
<BR>
representative of these ideas that I could find. Tragically, she is
<BR>
still the only one today.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motivation of President Clinton in this issue, besides
<BR>
liberalism, is a desire to
<BR>
leave a &quot;legacy&quot; of peace, peace pursued through worldwide appeasement
<BR>
of dictators, no matter
<BR>
what the human carnage to which it leads. If only the Republicans were
<BR>
able to offer an
<BR>
alternative.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Elian case, as in the Microsoft case, the Justice
<BR>
Department, once again, is
<BR>
fighting for injustice. The only political hero to emerge is the Mayor
<BR>
of Miami, no matter what
<BR>
his political motives, if any. What makes him admirable is his flat-out
<BR>
refusal to sanction or
<BR>
abet the Administration's policy.
<BR>
In the name not of Cuban nationalism, but of Americanism in its original
<BR>
<P>and deepest
<BR>
philosophical meaning, Elian Gonzalez must be allowed to remain here.
<BR>
Let this poor boy have a
<BR>
chance to live a human life. If &quot;compassion&quot; is one of our politicians'
<BR>
chief values, as they
<BR>
keep telling us, can't they show him any of it?
