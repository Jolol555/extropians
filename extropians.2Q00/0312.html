<EM>&gt; Unfortunately for MS, they seem to have been quite unable to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; straightforward or forthright about their reasons for managing at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one key issue the way that they have. Specifically, as an actual user of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Win98, I can confidently report that it was totally unnecessary for them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to insist that a Microsoft web browser be packaged with every copy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Windows98 -- in other words, there was no *technical* necessity for then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to market things that way.
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe this is picky, but I would feel better about MS if they had said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all along that including the browser was strictly a case of marketing or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packaging, it being their commercial right not to offer anything less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than a package deal if they don't want to?
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe what they actually said was that it is a competitive necessity for
<BR>
any modern OS to come with a bundled web browser.  Since I can't think of a
<BR>
modern OS that doesn't come with someone's browser, I think this is a
<BR>
reasonable claim.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As far as saying that Windows won't run without MS Internet Explorer,
</EM><BR>
well,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; if MS does things in a way that unnecessarily restricts its customers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that counts for more than all the complaints of a thousand competing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies, it seems to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, this is a good example of the MS approach to system optimization.
<BR>
What happened was once they decided they needed to include the a browser
<BR>
with every copy of the OS, they started thinking about how to do that
<BR>
without generating more complaints about code bloat.  So, they basically
<BR>
went through the IE feature list, found everything that duplicated
<BR>
functionality they wanted to be part of the OS, and started integrating the
<BR>
duplicated features.
<BR>
<P>The fact that this lets them claim IE is an essential part of the OS was
<BR>
probably a factor in their decision, but it makes good technical sense too.
<BR>
Why implement multiple systems for things like screen rendering, hyperlink
<BR>
navigation, and XML support if you don't have to?
<BR>
<P>So, what they have now is a software library that implements almost all of
<BR>
the IE functionality, and is also used by Windows wherever it presents a
<BR>
similar feature.  The IE program itself is just a thin wrapper around this
<BR>
functionality.  You can remove IE, but you can't get rid of the COM
<BR>
components that implement most of its features without breaking the system.
<BR>
OTOH, you can also use those components from your own programs, which is a
<BR>
nice benefit for ISVs and other sophisticated users of the OS.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; at some point the presumption of customers' intelligence and freedom to
</EM><BR>
choose
<BR>
<EM>&gt; ought to be placed foremost, don't you think?
</EM><BR>
<P>I've never understood why people think this is an issue.  You are perfectly
<BR>
free to use any browser you want.  You can get rid of the IE icon and menu
<BR>
item if you want to, and since browsers are free there isn't even a cost
<BR>
issue involved.  So, how is the fact that MS decided to build an HTML engine
<BR>
into their OS hurting anyone other than Netscape?
