<P>
The Cosmos Was Alive With the Sound of Matter  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by K.C. Cole (LA Times, May, 2000)
<BR>
<P>When the universe speaks, astronomers listen. When it sings, they swoon. 
<BR>
<P>That's roughly what happened late last month when a group of astronomers led
<BR>
by Caltech's Andrew Lange published the most detailed analysis yet of the
<BR>
cosmos' primordial song: a low hum, deep in its throat, that preceded both
<BR>
atoms and stars. 
<BR>
<P>It is a simple sound, like the mantra &quot;Om.&quot; But hidden within its harmonics
<BR>
are details of the universe's shape, composition and birth. So rich are
<BR>
these details that within hours of the paper's publication, new
<BR>
interpretations of the data had already appeared on the Los Alamos web for
<BR>
new astrophysical papers.
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's stirred up a hornet's nest of interest,&quot; said UCLA astronomer Ned
<BR>
Wright, who gave a talk to his colleagues on the paper the next week.
<BR>
<P>So what is all the fuss about? Why are astronomers churning out paper after
<BR>
paper on what looks to a lay person like a puzzling set of wiggly
<BR>
peaks--graphic depictions of the sound, based on hours of computer analysis?
<BR>
<P><P>Because there's scientific gold in them there sinusoidal hills.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The peaks and valleys paint a visual picture of the sound the newborn
<BR>
universe made when it was still wet behind the ears, a mere 300,000 years
<BR>
after its birth in a big bang. Nothing existed but pure light, speckled with
<BR>
occasional subatomic particles. 
<BR>
<P>Nothing happened, either, except that this light and matter fluid, as
<BR>
physicists call it, sloshed in and out of gravity wells, compressing the
<BR>
liquid in some places and spreading it out in others. Like banging on the
<BR>
head of a drum, the compression of the &quot;liquid light&quot; as it fell into
<BR>
gravity wells set up the &quot;sound waves&quot; that cosmologist Charles Lineweaver
<BR>
calls &quot;the oldest music in the universe.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>* * *
<BR>
Then, suddenly, the sound fell silent. The universe had gotten cold enough
<BR>
that the particles, in effect, congealed, like the salad dressing left in
<BR>
the fridge; the light separated and escaped, like the oil on top.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The rest is the history of the universe: The particles joined each other to
<BR>
form atoms, stars and everything else, including people. &quot;The universe was
<BR>
very simple back then,&quot; said Lange. &quot;After that, we have atoms, chemistry,
<BR>
economics. Things go downhill very quickly.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>As for the light, or radiation, it still pervades all space. In fact, it's
<BR>
part of the familiar &quot;snow&quot; that sometimes shows up on broadcast TV. But
<BR>
it's more than just noise: When the particles congealed, they left an
<BR>
imprint on the light. Like children going after cookies, the patterns of
<BR>
sloshing particles left their sticky fingerprints all over the sky. The
<BR>
pattern of the sloshes tells you all you need to know about the very early
<BR>
universe: It's shape, how much was made of matter, how much of something
<BR>
else. 
<BR>
<P>The principle is familiar: Your child's voice sounds like no one else's
<BR>
because the resonant cavities within her throat create a unique voiceprint.
<BR>
The large, heavy wood of the cello creates a mellower sound than the
<BR>
high-strung violin. Just so, the sounds coming from the early universe
<BR>
depend directly on the density of matter, and the shape of the cosmos
<BR>
itself. 
<BR>
<P>Astronomers can't hear the sounds, of course. But they can read them on the
<BR>
walls of the universe like notes on a page. Compressed sound gets hot, and
<BR>
produces hot splotches, like a pressure cooker. Expanded areas cool. Analyze
<BR>
the hot and cold patches and you get a picture of the sound: exactly how
<BR>
much falls on middle C, or B flat.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
What they've seen so far is both exciting and troubling. The sound suggests
<BR>
that the universe is a tad too heavy with ordinary matter to agree with
<BR>
standard cosmological theories; it resonates more like an oboe than a flute.
<BR>
Something's going on that can't be explained. The answers may come when an
<BR>
even more ambitious probe launches into space later this year.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Lest you think these sounds are music only for astronomers' ears, consider:
<BR>
The same wrinkles in space that created the gravity wells that gave rise to
<BR>
the sounds also blew up to form clusters, galaxies, stars, planets, us.
