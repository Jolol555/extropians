<EM>&gt; Oh, they're terribly viable weapons if *you've* got them and the enemy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *doesn't*.  So, diamond is 10x stronger than steel... that means your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jet might be light enough for you to *outrun* non-diamondoid missiles.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might not need diamondoid missiles to shoot down diamondoid planes.
<BR>
Unmanned aircraft would probably work just fine, esp. if armed with
<BR>
hypersonic missiles. Modern fighter aircraft are limited in flight by their
<BR>
most delicate component: human crew. There will be one, maybe two, more
<BR>
generations of manned fighters. The whole question is rendered moot by the
<BR>
USAF's development (on-time, under-budget) of the airborne lasers for
<BR>
theater defense against ballistic missles. Diamondoid, superalloy, or
<BR>
unobtainium composite, your jet won't be light enough to *outrun* a laser
<BR>
beam. Evasive actions to break line-of-sight or specialized coatings to
<BR>
diffuse beam power might help
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Heck, right now, Moscow is screaming because the US is talking about an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ABM defense.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moscow screams about US ABM defense proposals as a political ploy, not
<BR>
because they seriously believe the limited and marginally competent hardware
<BR>
possessed by the US poses any real threat to their ability to vaporize big
<BR>
chunks of North America's cities.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;A few years?&quot;  A heck of a lot can happen in a few years!  If the USSR
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had developed nukes &quot;a few years&quot; before the US, instead of vice versa,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there would have been hell to pay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly disagree. At best, USSR instead of USA would have conquered
<BR>
Japan. At worst, WW2 would have continued in Europe as US and USSR turned on
<BR>
each other. US casualties would have been terribly high as Soviet bombs fell
<BR>
on troops advancing through Eastern Europe, but the superior industrial base
<BR>
of America would have told in time. Ultimately, American nuclear bombs from
<BR>
Pacific or Indian airfields would have turned USSR's surviving industry to
<BR>
glass. The Cold War would have started later, another generation would have
<BR>
been lost to war, and the USSR would have been more tightly confined than it
<BR>
was in history. I would also expect to see the Cold War end sooner.
