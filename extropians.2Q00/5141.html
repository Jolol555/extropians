<EM>&gt; we care about preserving our cells while they're young?
</EM><BR>
<P>To maximize the # of cells available with the minimum amount of accumulated

damage (with the implicit assumption that &quot;damage&quot; is accumulating.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All the animal

<EM>&gt; cloning experiments seem to show that the genome -- at least in some cells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -- is perfectly preserved (although we still lack data for the longevity of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clones, making this a provisionary, but probably accurate, statement).
</EM><BR>
<P>All the cloning experiments show is that in the clones that *work*,
<BR>
you have a &quot;functional&quot; genome.  If the success rate is ~1% for
<BR>
creating clones, that says there *may* be a lot of cells that cannot
<BR>
create a functional organism.  Miscarriage rates of 50-70% (rates
<BR>
claimed vary) would argue this is true as well.  The question is
<BR>
whether the difference between 30-50% &quot;good&quot; germ cell &quot;combinations&quot;
<BR>
and ~1% cloning success is due to even higher in vivo natural filtering
<BR>
of defective cells (sperm/eggs) that isn't done in cloning, or is due to
<BR>
real methodology problems in the clonning techniques.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I know there is at least one company that does what you propose (they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sent me some publicity a few months ago) but I really don't see the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point in it.
</EM><BR>
<P>The point would be as a backup strategy for individuals who are
<BR>
pessimistic about the harvesting of stem-cells that can be grown
<BR>
into organs as you grow older or who believe that whole genome
<BR>
syn-cells or nanobot genome replacements are a long way away.
<BR>
(Programmers try to look at all the possibilities.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the same line of reasoning -- and I think I've posted a message about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this before --, I'm still to ear a good explanation to the animal cloning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiments on the basis of the DNA damage theory of aging.
</EM><BR>
<P>Some fraction of the genomes harvested being &quot;good enough&quot; is sufficent
<BR>
explanation in my book.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As for mitotic misregulation as the basis of aging, that's a speculatory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conclusion. You can always argue that some upstream mechanism is regulating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the genetic machinery and creating the mitotic imbalances.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Quite true, point mutations in any of the regulatory timing elements
<BR>
coult through the whole thing into disarray.
