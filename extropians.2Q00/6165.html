<P>
I swear I'm not associated in any way with Dankoff pumps, but I've been so
<BR>
impressed with their products that I want to say one more thing about them.
<BR>
Some of their pumps (like for instance the piston pump I have) are designed
<BR>
specifically with remote areas in mind.  They are simply and ruggedly built
<BR>
so that a person can work on them without any special tools, and all the
<BR>
parts are replacable and can be bought from Dankoff.  The disadvantage of a
<BR>
piston pump over, say, a centrifugal pump is that the piston pump contains
<BR>
more moving parts.  I don't see this as necessarily a problem as long as
<BR>
spare parts are readily available at reasonable prices, which they are from
<BR>
Dankoff.
<BR>
<P>The same can't be said for other pump manufacturers. I have generally good
<BR>
things to say about Teel pumps, and it IS possible to get parts, but the
<BR>
cost is prohibitive. I cracked the pump housing on a Teel cast aluminum
<BR>
centrifugal pump that sells for a bit less than $200 in the Grainger
<BR>
catalogue.  To buy a new housing costs almost as much as buying a whole new
<BR>
pump.  All the parts are like this.  They obviously want you to buy new
<BR>
pumps rather than fixing old ones. (I'm not very good at welding, especially
<BR>
aluminum, and I haven't been able to find anyone who was willing to try
<BR>
welding the crack in the housing.)
<BR>
<P>Now that we have the internet, I think there's an opportunity for small
<BR>
manufacturing businesses like Dankoff, to make good, rugged products that
<BR>
can be repaired rather than junked and replaced.
<BR>
