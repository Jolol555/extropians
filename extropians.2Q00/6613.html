<EM>&gt; I don't think it's possible to have an infinite utility. Here's a thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiment to find out what your maximum utility is:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Suppose a genie told you that he could grant you one wish (which may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; composed of an infinite number of subwishes), but first you would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tortured for a year, and then the wish only has 1% chance of coming true. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would you accept? What if the wish has only 0.1% chance of coming true? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Keep lowering the probability until you refuse to accept. Now divide zero
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minus the of the utility of being tortured by that probability to get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maximum utility.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think I'd take a year of torture even for a 100% chance of having
<BR>
every wish granted.  At least not if it was bad torture.  Maybe a day
<BR>
of torture, but not a year.
<BR>
<P>Is it possible though that I'm not being rational in saying this?
<BR>
Maybe the rational thing to do is to take the torture, in the sense that
<BR>
if I did, afterwards I would say it was the right decision.  But perhaps
<BR>
I am too blinded by fear to go through with it?
