Subject: Brook Norton's comments on Nanotech Repair
<BR>
Date: 4/20/2000
<BR>
From: Fred Chamberlain
<BR>
Re: Brook Norton's comments on Nanotech Repair
<BR>
<P>Brook says:
<BR>
&quot;But what if nanotech is unable to patch together all of the
<BR>
freezing-damaged neurons and instead we find that it's easier to construct 
<BR>
new neurons that mimic the damaged ones? And let's say this is the case for 
<BR>
50% of my brain. Now am I the same person or am I half a copy? &quot;
<BR>
<P>(my reply)
<BR>
Interestingly, these are questions we pose in great detail, in Alcor's
<BR>
&quot;LifePact&quot; self-interview outline, used for making camcorder recordings of 
<BR>
one's memories, ideas and preferences.  Each person needs to express his 
<BR>
views of such matters. For myself, the answer is that if such procedures are 
<BR>
commonly used to repair large portions of brains damaged in accidents, in 
<BR>
the future, by the mainstream medical establishment, I would not reject such 
<BR>
repairs to restore me from cryonic suspension.
<BR>
<P>If I had concerns, I would name persons I respected, who I thought were 
<BR>
unlikely to (all) have died or have been suspended, to make such
<BR>
determinations on my behalf, in the spirit of delegating decision making 
<BR>
given to medical surrogates today.
<BR>
<P>What do you do if you wake up and find that everyone, virtually everyone, 
<BR>
has switched from &quot;biobrain&quot; to &quot;hyperbrain&quot;?  In that case, you'd better 
<BR>
check your own head to see if you are carrying an identity module yourself.  
<BR>
If this possibility concerns you, then I suggest your only alternative is to 
<BR>
clearly state in a LifePact preference statement that you &quot;wouldn't want 
<BR>
that done to you&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Consider that if such a wish were respected, in the case hypothesized, the 
<BR>
question is then, &quot;Might you wake up as someone whose processes of thought 
<BR>
were only one thousandth of those around you?&quot; Will there be colonies of 
<BR>
such people, better satisfied with their reanimations
<BR>
if they are a small collective who are at least as they once were?  Perhaps!
<BR>
<P>The bottom line is, if you have preferences, you need to express them in a 
<BR>
concrete way, and see that they are archived as such with your suspension 
<BR>
records.  And, if you express strong preferences for modes of reanimation 
<BR>
which are suboptimum, are you going to leave flexibility for judgements on 
<BR>
the parts of others, perhaps others you trust?  Or, are you going to say, 
<BR>
&quot;I'd rather never wake up at all if I cannot wake up as I now envision it 
<BR>
being acceptable!&quot;
<BR>

Subject: Brook Norton's &quot;What are the odds?&quot;
<BR>
From: Fred Chamberlain
<BR>
<P>(Brook pointed out the small probability of death before old age, saying:
<BR>
&quot;I feel funny arguing this side of the argument because I promote cryonics 
<BR>
to friends and family and try to get folks to sign up. But I believe harm is 
<BR>
also done in overstating our case. A sense of overzealousness is 
<BR>
communicated when one says &quot;You must sign up now. Don't wait!&quot; when to all 
<BR>
appearances there is no urgency.&quot;Brook NortonA couple of thoughts:
<BR>
<P>(1)  If you wait until you find you have a terminal illness, insurance will 
<BR>
be unobtainable, so buy insurance now (I'm sure Rudi Hoffman will endorse 
<BR>
this point of view, right, Rudi?)
<BR>
<P>(2)  Auto insurance is likewise much less than the cost of an acual 
<BR>
accident, particularly if there are large claims of damages for medical or 
<BR>
&quot;loss of life&quot; reasons.  The chances of an auto accident are low, but we 
<BR>
still buy insurance. We still wear safety harnesses.
<BR>
<P>(3)  If you find that your light plane is about to crash, however unlikely 
<BR>
that might be, either you have a parachute along, or you don't.  If you 
<BR>
don't, jumping out is not much of an option.
<BR>
<P>Alcor just had a &quot;last minute call&quot; from someone who contacted us about 3
<BR>
months ago, saying that &quot;It might be months or weeks&quot;.  Since then, no 
<BR>
action was taken.  Now, the person who contemplated suspension is reported 
<BR>
to be unconscious.  Informed consent on the part of this person is not 
<BR>
possible, at least at the moment.  Should you sign up now?  That's an 
<BR>
individual choice, to be sure, but those who cannot overcome procrastination 
<BR>
and sign up while in good health are unlikely to manage to make arrangements 
<BR>
at the last moment either.
<BR>
<P>A long time ago, someone remarked that knowing about cryonics and not 
<BR>
signing up was, in fact, a &quot;choice&quot;.  It was a choice not to be suspended if 
<BR>
death caught the person concerned by surprise, or under unfavorable 
<BR>
circumstances.
<BR>
<P>All of us have different ways of weighing values and priorities.  We each 
<BR>
have to choose.  Weighing the odds is certainly important.
<BR>
A cave explorer of the 1950's remarked that he wanted to have about as much 
<BR>
safety in his vertical rope as was necessary to reduce the odds of the rope 
<BR>
breaking, to the odds that he would be hit by a car when crossing the street 
<BR>
after looking carefully.  This ushered in the era of climbing on 9/16 
<BR>
manilla, back before nylon ropes were in vogue.  Each of us must weight the 
<BR>
odds, and take our chances.
