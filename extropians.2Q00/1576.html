STARDUST SPACECRAFT CATCHING DUST IN THE WIND
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an excited kid hoping to snag a fly ball at a
<BR>
professional baseball game, NASA's Stardust spacecraft has
<BR>
extended its high-tech &quot;catcher's mitt&quot; to collect a valuable
<BR>
space souvenir -- a batch of interstellar dust particles.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust is contained in a stream of particles that flows
<BR>
through our solar system, and scientists are anxious to study it
<BR>
so they can learn more about the formation of Earth, other
<BR>
planets and life.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We can see this material with the naked eye as a black zone
<BR>
running along the center of the Milky Way,&quot; said Dr. Donald
<BR>
Brownlee of the University of Washington in Seattle, principal
<BR>
investigator for Stardust.  &quot;These particles contain the heavy
<BR>
chemical elements that originated in the stars.  Since every atom
<BR>
in our bodies came from the inside of stars, by studying these
<BR>
interstellar dust particles we can learn about our cosmic roots.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stardust is equipped with a special collector containing
<BR>
aerogel, a unique substance that can trap the particles and store
<BR>
the precious cargo safely until it's returned to Earth. The
<BR>
aerogel collector has two sides, one designed to gather the
<BR>
interstellar dust and one for comet dust collection, which will
<BR>
take place later in the mission.  Engineers orient the spacecraft
<BR>
to control which side of the collector is exposed to a dust
<BR>
stream.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, Stardust is oriented so that the interstellar
<BR>
dust particles are hitting the backside of the collector.  This
<BR>
collection began on February 22, when the spacecraft's sample
<BR>
return capsule opened and the aerogel collector was moved out of
<BR>
the capsule.  It will remain in this configuration until May 1,
<BR>
when the collector will return to its stowed position for safe
<BR>
storage until mid-2002, when another period of interstellar dust
<BR>
collection is scheduled.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The project's name, 'Stardust,' reflects the importance of
<BR>
this event,&quot; said Stardust Project Manager Dr. Kenneth Atkins of
<BR>
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, Calif.  &quot;It's
<BR>
the first time anyone has attempted to catch anything like this
<BR>
and bring it home.  After all the design, building, testing, and
<BR>
now the flying of this spacecraft over the past four years, the
<BR>
moment of truth for the collector is here.  These tiny particles
<BR>
zip by at 20 to 25 kilometers per second (about 45,000 to 56,000
<BR>
miles per hour) relative to the spacecraft.  The aerogel must
<BR>
slow them to a stop in fractions of an inch.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late December 2003, the collector will be deployed again
<BR>
in preparation for the gathering of comet dust samples when
<BR>
Stardust flies by Comet Wild-2 on January 2, 2004.  Once the
<BR>
samples of both interstellar dust and comet dust are tucked
<BR>
safely inside the aerogel collector, it will be retracted into
<BR>
the sample return capsule.   Stardust will begin the return trip
<BR>
to Earth and make a soft landing at the U.S. Air Force's Utah
<BR>
Test and Training Range in 2006.  The sample canister will be
<BR>
taken to the planetary material curatorial facility at NASA's
<BR>
Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.  The samples will be
<BR>
carefully extracted and then examined by scientists.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm thrilled at the thought of being able to look at and
<BR>
study these particles firsthand,&quot; Brownlee said.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More information on the Stardust mission is available at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/">http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/</A> .
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stardust was launched on February 7, 1999.  The mission is
<BR>
managed by JPL for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington,
<BR>
D.C. Lockheed Martin Astronautics, Denver, Co, built and operates
<BR>
the spacecraft. Science instruments were provided by JPL, the
<BR>
University of Chicago and the Max Planck Institute, Garching,
<BR>
Germany. JPL is a division of the California Institute of
<BR>
Technology, Pasadena.
