<EM>&gt; First, about Brian.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         He's smart, *very* smart. ultra-whiz-kid type smart.
</EM><BR>
<P>Heh.  Not on this list, kiddo.  Half the membership of the Extropy
<BR>
Institute could eat him for breakfast.  I'm a whiz kid even by Extropian
<BR>
standards, and I don't recall asking anyone to excuse insulting behavior
<BR>
because of my youth, back when I first joined the list at age sixteen. 
<BR>
As for excusing it because he's smart, forget it!  Being smarter means
<BR>
you get held to *higher* standards.
<BR>
<P>I don't care if you grew up knowing that everyone around you was a
<BR>
moron.  If you have any bad habits acquired from that, unlearn them! 
<BR>
What the hell else are you using all that intelligence *for*?
<BR>
<P>Frankly, I think Delaney's a moron.  (*Delaney*, people!  Not *Brian*! 
<BR>
We already have a Brian on this list!)  In fact, he appears to be that
<BR>
highly specialized type of moron that results when someone of &quot;high
<BR>
intelligence&quot; devotes that intelligence to rationalizing arbitrary
<BR>
positions.  I use &quot;high intelligence&quot; in quotes because I see no
<BR>
evidence that Delaney is any smarter than, say, your average scientist
<BR>
or science-fiction fan.
<BR>
<P>It does appear that he's contracted that particular disease of growing
<BR>
up smarter than the people around you, in which you automatically assume
<BR>
that you know what's going on inside everyone else's head.  I have that
<BR>
disease too, but at least I back down and apologize when someone calls
<BR>
me on it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         More than that, he takes intellectual disagreements very very seriously and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assumes other people do the same. He also assumes people are smarter than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they actually are. You often hear people with IQs of 170 (or whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Brian's is) constantly talking about how stupid people are.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't constantly talk about how stupid people are, and I'm a hell of a
<BR>
lot smarter than Delaney.  I reserve accusations of stupidity or mention
<BR>
of my own intelligence strictly for deflating people who have the cosmic
<BR>
nerve to try and pull rank on me or the Extropians list.
