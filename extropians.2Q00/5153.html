<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Yeah, all you need is a transparent society controlled by a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;totalitarian regime, and populated by robots.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Actually I was thinking more of a society of people enlightened
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enough to realize that what's good for the whole is good for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individual.  It's simply a matter of realizing that the surest way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to keep your neighbor from stealing your bread is to be sure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he has enough to keep his own belly full.  I call it &quot;enlightened
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self-interest.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Makes for good utopia novels, but is a complete denial of human
<BR>
nature, all it takes is one bad apple for the whole thing to
<BR>
unravel.
<BR>
<P>Besides you can practice &quot;enlightened self-interest&quot; as a good
<BR>
Capitalist. If you live below your means (my new lifestyle) and
<BR>
sack the rest away in good investments, you can play philantropist
<BR>
to your hearts content.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Unfortunately such a society is unlikely to be stable for long as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long as  there is not enough to go around for *everyone*.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hopefully that minor problem will soon be solved by the good folks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;over at Foresight :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually I think the World Game folks have demonstrated that there
<BR>
is enough to go around for everyone to die of gluttony. It is
<BR>
economic practices that hamper sufficient re-distribution.
<BR>
<P>Here's a fun game, especially if you have children. Next time you
<BR>
go to the grocery store, bring them along and tell them they can
<BR>
have ten dollars to buy food for the hungry. Let them scamper
<BR>
around and price things out, and discuss their choices with them.
<BR>
<P>One time my nieces (I'm single) found 20lb bags of rice for a bit
<BR>
over 5 bucks each, I extended the amount to 11 dollars and they
<BR>
bought two. Another time they bought bread on sale, and an amazing
<BR>
amount of generic peanut butter and jelly. The fun part is after
<BR>
comparing the prices they switched their own consumption to the
<BR>
less expensive brands.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.&quot;
