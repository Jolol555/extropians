<P>
&quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; says:
<BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I didn't sign it, anybody claiming to have seen me sign it is a damn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; liar, and you can't make me sign it!  :-) See Lysander Spooner on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; topic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True, but have you ever voted?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I have voted in my younger, more naive days, but I've kicked the
<BR>
habit.  At any event, I'm not about to feel guilty about placing my
<BR>
allegiance with my rational self-interest and with the good, rather
<BR>
than with the U.S. government, just because I may have participated in
<BR>
its ceremonies, exercises, and privileges in the past.  I've learned a
<BR>
hell of a lot since then, and what I've learned directs my commitments
<BR>
now.  Moreover, the bounds of honor and integrity don't constrain one
<BR>
fighting off a thief or murderer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Served on a jury? 
</EM><BR>
<P>They wouldn't let me.  All because I told the prosecutor during jury
<BR>
selection that I was dead opposed to drug laws (in New York City these
<BR>
would be the notorious Rockefeller laws) and it would violate my
<BR>
conscience to find the poor guy before us (they kindly told us it was
<BR>
a &quot;buy-and-bust&quot; case -- their very words -- prior to selection)
<BR>
guilty, and that I agitated for and spent my money trying to get the
<BR>
drug laws changed.  After a brief lecture from the judge on the rule
<BR>
of law, I was sent over to civil, where I also didn't get on a jury.
<BR>
I did spend a mostly pleasant week reading a technical book I'd meant
<BR>
to get around to forever.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Held public office or been employed by the government?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Served in the military? 
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Said the pledge of allegiance?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, along with all the other kids in my elementary school.  I
<BR>
particularly enjoyed the spectacle of one kid's being shouted at by a
<BR>
teacher in front of the whole group that it didn't matter that his
<BR>
mother wanted him excused from the pledge for religious reasons -- he
<BR>
was going to join in with everyone else, dammit! which he sullenly
<BR>
did, IIRC.  Well, they sure won a patriot over there!  A whole
<BR>
roomful, in fact.
<BR>
<P>We were minors and we were ordered to pledge allegiance.  That has as
<BR>
much validity as a contract as the implicit contract between the sheep
<BR>
and the man with the shears.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Verbal contracts are binding on the integrity of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual. That being said,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any man who won't sign a written contract can't be trusted on his word
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either...IMHO
</EM><BR>
<P>Contracts require some kind of rational parameters to be meaningful.
<BR>
Just what kind of open-ended commitment is this &quot;social contract&quot; or
<BR>
even the (at least written) &quot;pledge of allegiance&quot;?  Imagine the
<BR>
uproar if any other entity tried to get schoolchildren to take a
<BR>
verbal pledge and then adduced the children's performance as a sign of
<BR>
a legitimate verbal &quot;contract&quot; with specific binding requirements!
<BR>
Sheer nonsense.  And, like the earlier poster (Charles Stross?  My
<BR>
apologies if misattributed) I find it Orwellian.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; is going to be used for unjust aggression.  Kicking over Saddam Hussein's
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;or
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Omar Quadaffi's pile of blocks is no problem to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That Omar -- such a naughty boy!  Omar Quadaffi?  Oh well, whoever he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is, he probably has a good block kicking coming, right?  Or else why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would the U.S. be kicking his blocks?  Must be his fault.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone who orders the bombing of a plane carrying hundreds of innocent people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deserves to get his own house targeted by laser guided bombs...
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't follow.  How does this relate to this mysterious individual
<BR>
&quot;Omar Quadaffi&quot;?  
<BR>
<P>Now I, like you, would waste no tears over Moammar Quadaffi's
<BR>
hypothetical demise, because I give some skeptical credence to the
<BR>
news sources that report that he is responsible for various terrorist
<BR>
attacks.  But I would think twice about holding such an opinion if I
<BR>
were not even sure of his name.  And since I know how convenient the
<BR>
U.S. State Dept. finds it to demonize pariah states, I read any news
<BR>
of Quadaffi and Libya with skepticism and eyes wide open for
<BR>
distortion or manipulation.
<BR>
<P>All the best,
<BR>
James Wetterau
