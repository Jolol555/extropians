<EM>&gt;If you look at their figures over the last 150 years we find that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;down/up month ratio has gone from 18/35 pre WWI to 11/50 post WWII.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The economy spent 1/3 of its time in recession back then, and only 1/6 of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the time now.  This is a big improvement and I think we can give credit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to our improved understanding of economic theory.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;I see several competing explanations, and no easy way to apportion credit.
<BR>
&nbsp;Improved inventory management has reduced frequent short-term economic
<BR>
fluctuations. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Service industries are more stable than commodity manufacturing industries.
<BR>
The increasing share of the economy devoted to stable industries should
<BR>
stabilize the economy.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Note that the Fed (and to a lesser extent professional economists) have
<BR>
a strong incentive to promote the belief that improved understanding of
<BR>
economics has stabilized the economy; few people have a comparable
<BR>
incentive to promote other explanations.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Whatever the reasons for the reduced frequency of recessions, I suspect
<BR>
that there are multiple causes of business cycles, and that we can't be
<BR>
as confident that long-term or infrequent cycles (the Kondratieff wave?
<BR>
long-term changes in attitudes towards debt?) have been reduced as we
<BR>
can be about the more common cycles based on things like inventory adjustments.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I question your assumption that the Fed in the 1930s was ignorant of any
<BR>
important economic principles that the Fed uses today to manage the economy.
<BR>
They appear to have done as much to increase the money supply as they could
<BR>
have done without abandoning their goal of maintaining the gold standard,
<BR>
a goal which might well have been right if political support for it could
<BR>
have been maintained.
<BR>
&nbsp;The switch from a (partial) gold standard to a pure fiat currency has
<BR>
almost certainly altered the kind of monetary mistakes that are likely,
<BR>
so we shouldn't expect future economic problems to be reruns of the 1930s.
