Brian, it's true that I'd never heard the word &quot;extropian&quot; until a few weeks
<BR>
ago, although I was already familiar with nanotechnology, cryonics, etc.--at
<BR>
least with the general concepts.  You obviously have been around longer than
<BR>
I have, and so I would have to assume that you know more about what it means
<BR>
to be Extropian than I do.  But from reading the principles I really can't
<BR>
see that your narrow definition is called for. Actually, I've never claimed
<BR>
to be Extropian.  I found this list appealing because I liked the word
<BR>
&quot;extropian&quot; and because I'm interested in many of the ideas discussed here.
<BR>
But I don't think your posts really have to do with what's extropian and
<BR>
what's not.  I sense some sort of metaphysical hostility, as though you
<BR>
resent the fact that someone could live slightly outside the reality you're
<BR>
used to and have the effrontery to discuss it in public.
<BR>
<P>As I mentioned in an earlier post, you seem to believe that the term
<BR>
&quot;technology&quot; should be restricted to that which is developed by highly
<BR>
funded, tightly organized, &quot;official&quot; institutions.  My reading of the
<BR>
history of technology leads me to believe that truly revolutionary
<BR>
technology more often than not comes from the (not-so-very-well-funded)
<BR>
non-institutional fringes.
<BR>
<P>You appear to believe that I'm not capable of doing worthwhile research
<BR>
because I'm not employed by a &quot;government,&quot; an &quot;accredited university,&quot; or a
<BR>
&quot;corporation.&quot; You seem to believe that the only way to further science is
<BR>
to contribute money to institutions.  Did it never occur to you that
<BR>
spending one's time in doing research and using one's mind and one's time to
<BR>
THINK might yield results as valuable as, or more valuable than the amount
<BR>
of money that could be made in a like time?  Money, after all, is a form of
<BR>
stored work--and I'm using the term work here broadly, to include mental
<BR>
exertion as well as physical labor.
<BR>
<P>I haven't mentioned another reason I choose not to have a large income, but
<BR>
I'll mention it now, to give a more complete picture.  I don't wish to pay
<BR>
income taxes, thereby supporting the activities of the people operating
<BR>
under the guise of the federal government. I consider most of their
<BR>
activities to be &quot;Entropian,&quot; to the extent that every dollar's worth of
<BR>
work given them is the equivalent of a couple of dollars worth of work
<BR>
subtracted from life-enhancing activities.
<BR>
<P>So, Brian, I've told you a bit about myself and what I'm doing.  What is it
<BR>
you're doing to further the cause? Have you stepped outside YOUR comfort
<BR>
zone lately?
<BR>
<P>Bonnie

<BR>
<P><P>I agree with what you are saying and with the long term goals. What I
<BR>
don't agree with is the idea of spending your precious years here (which
<BR>
as you point out, may be limited due to you losing the race between death
<BR>
and medical tech) on simple pleasures. Based on today's technology you
<BR>
have a very limited time- let's put it in terms of money- you have perhaps
<BR>
$1,000,000 (say $10,000 per year of life). You can blow your money on
<BR>
gardening for 50 years or you can blow it on developing your personal
<BR>
empire to the point that you just might be able to nudge the medical
<BR>
technology forward a bit quicker thereby helping to save not only your
<BR>
life but a lot of other people who happen to be right on the dividing
<BR>
point between living forever and not living forever. Which, as an
<BR>
extropian, is the correct choice? Do you choose challenge or comfort?
