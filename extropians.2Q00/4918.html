Another reason to keep a diary: Although I can't vouch for the methodology 
<BR>
of the study, I read a report a few days ago about a study showing that 
<BR>
men's memories of events in adolescence was no better than chance. That's 
<BR>
amazing. I find it surprising that the accuracy is no better than chance, 
<BR>
but not at all surprised that memory (I think it was over a 30-year time 
<BR>
period) is extremely poor. We all know that memory works by inference and 
<BR>
is not at all like a photograph.
<BR>
<P>I used to keep a diary regularly but now find I don't make the time. I 
<BR>
really need to buy voice-activated software. Having that excuse to speak to 
<BR>
my computer might get me in the habit again. Ideally I'd like something 
<BR>
similar to what Bruce Sterling described in his first novel, The Artificial 
<BR>
Kid. The protagonist was constantly accompanied by flying cameras that 
<BR>
recorded everything he did and that happened to him. (Although I'd want to 
<BR>
add some &quot;internal soundtrack/thoughttrack&quot;.)
<BR>
<P>For me this is a matter of historical biographical interest, and insight 
<BR>
into understand what shapes my later self. I do not agree with those who 
<BR>
seem to think they die out unless their future self remembers them clearly. 
<BR>
I am not inherently interested in preserving my current self, but in seeing 
<BR>
that my current self continually develops into better future selves. My 
<BR>
current self will always survive as a major cause of my future selves. (For 
<BR>
way more than you want to read about this, see my doctoral dissertation on 
<BR>
my web site--&quot;The Diachronic Self: Identity, Continuity, Transformation.)
<BR>
<P>I'll be saying something about this during my part of the panel session 
<BR>
following Natasha's presentation next Saturday at the Alcor Life Extension 
<BR>
Technology Conference.
