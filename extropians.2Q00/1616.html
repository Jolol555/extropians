<EM>&gt; &quot;If you magically introduced one of these aircars for a price of about $20,000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; today, with a production capacity of a million units a year, GM, Ford,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Toyota, Daimler Chrysler, et al would all be declaring bankruptcy in short
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; order, and you'd have millions of unionized autoworkers out on the streets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unemployed. Markets woul crash (all except your AirCar, Inc. stock), wealth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would evaporate, consumer spending would decrease (all those autoworkers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unemployed), and you'd get the vicious cycle I described earlier. Those other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies could try to introduce similar products, but they can't compete
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being saddled by all those union labor costs, by their outmoded factories,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and their lack of automation.  Are you starting to see what I am getting at?

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Isn't this basically the phenomena that Marx saw correctly and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; described as the weakness of Capitalism
</EM><BR>
<P>It is a strength, if managed. Marx had very little ability to see systems function
<BR>
in his mind on a dynamic basis, which you can tell by the 'static' concepts he was
<BR>
always propounding, which is why so many of his assumptions and conclusions are so
<BR>
off.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     He thought that because Capitalism was constantly undergoing this sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change and disrupting people and constantly requiring reinvestment that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not be required in a planned economy that Capitalism would eventually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collapse?  Is that a fair representation of his position?
</EM><BR>
<P>Essentially correct, but he, like many before him, lived in an era of little
<BR>
technological change relative to today, where big changes were seen as very
<BR>
frightening and world shattering occurences. As it is, each new technological
<BR>
introduction is rather minute, and affects only a small small sector of the
<BR>
economy at any given time. The scenario I described above shows what would happen
<BR>
when some big unexpected change occurs and the parties are not able to adapt.
<BR>
<P>Marx's idea of a planned economy only works in worlds where there is no increase
<BR>
in population, no decrease or increase in resource availability or recovery costs,
<BR>
and no new technological developments. Its perfect for such static economies. Its
<BR>
pathetic for competing with a dynamic technological world.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     But isn't it also true that while our changes do cause disruptions and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other economic damage, in the short run, that in the long run those same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phenomena are what caused Capitalism to thrive and Communism to collapse.
</EM><BR>
<P>They are what caused communism to collapse, and they are one of the contributors
<BR>
to unemployment. However seeing the technological dynamism of capitalist economies
<BR>
as a bad thing rests on one big false assumption: that people can never learn new
<BR>
skills. You and I know this is totally false, however in the stratified, caste
<BR>
type world of Germany in the mid 1800's, this was a perfectly valid assumption for
<BR>
Marx to make.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     Consider what a really accurate watch used to cost.  Then along came the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; digital watch and an entire industry disappeared.  But today does anyone miss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them?
</EM><BR>
<P>Only those that appreciate quality handmade watches, and people like that tend to
<BR>
be willing to pay for the high cost these days. I'll bet though that there were a
<BR>
lot of unhappy unemployed watchmakers at one point though. As I said, in the long
<BR>
run, big changes are not a bad thing. However springing huge new technologies on a
<BR>
public caught unawares is more likely to cause greater disruption than it has to.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     By the same token the vinyl disk record disappeared; they tell me that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the CD is going to get its comeuppance also.  The record of disappeared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industries that have been advantageously is so long it would bore you for me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to tell it.  In fact the same auto industry you cited destroyed all sorts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industries.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, buggy whips. The Concord Carriage company was one of the biggest horse drawn
<BR>
carriage companies in the US. Henry Ford's greatest invention wasn't the assembly
<BR>
line, it was the livable wage (which obviously was possible because of the
<BR>
assembly line). Enabling your employees to all be able to afford your product is a
<BR>
genius stroke to build markets and a middle class of consumers. Ford's downfall
<BR>
will be his grandson's acquiescence to the UAW in limiting automation on the
<BR>
assembly line.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     Yet, the world gets better.
</EM><BR>
<P>It does get better because huge changes don't happen all at once,  and we can now
<BR>
see change coming and plan for it accurately with a pretty good degree of
<BR>
numerical accuracy.
