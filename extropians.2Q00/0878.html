<EM>&gt; &gt;US Federal judges have been dealing with lots of mandatory sentences for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;long time.  All the ones I've talked to or read comments by HATE them.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;say that mandatory sentences result in palpable injustice too often and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;causes absurd charging and plea bargaining when even the prosecutors can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;stand to see them applied.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What a horrible notion.  Each case obviously has a multitude of specifics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and is almost always different in some way from each case before it.  Judge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rulings reflect that.  By imposing mandatory sentences, the right to fair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trial as well as freedom of speech are demolished in one fell swoop.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law is an often infuriating, often beautiful piece of complex work...but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for good reason.  Keeping it this way for now, is much better than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alternative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BTW, which kind of laws are these mandatory sentences referring to?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>THis is always the crux. The minimum sentence for Captial Murder is
<BR>
death, and the minimum sentence for non-capital murder is typically a
<BR>
life sentence, with or without parole (a minimum of 20 years). Should
<BR>
these be less? I don't think so, though there is little evidence in the
<BR>
body of statistics to show a deterrent factor for execution. What seems
<BR>
to be the objection are minimum sentences that are disproportionate to
<BR>
the rest of the criminal code. This objection sure has merit. However
<BR>
what are the alternatives to minimum sentences? The reason they were
<BR>
instituted was due to offenses on both ends of the scale. Liberal judges
<BR>
in innner city courts would typically impose very lenient sentences upon
<BR>
criminals for heinous crimes, while in rural southern and western states
<BR>
(and yes, even in places like Massachusetts and New York State) you
<BR>
would get bigoted white judges giving harsh sentences to minorities.
<BR>
<P>Right now in NH we are dealing with the dissolution of our State Supreme
<BR>
Court due to improper influence by recused judges and the appearance of
<BR>
financial improprieties. One judge not implicated has indicated that the
<BR>
Chief Justice had also 'gone shopping' for judges for at least one case,
<BR>
the Claremont decision, that he knew agreed with him, indicating not
<BR>
only a rigging of the verdict, but a pretrial judgement by the Chief
<BR>
Justice. That the highest judges in the state could be this corrupt,
<BR>
when they are supposed to be the most ethical, bodes ill for all the
<BR>
other judges in the system. 
<BR>
<P>Judges are only human, like anyone else, and are just as prone to
<BR>
personal faults. Personal faults should not become the faults of the
<BR>
system, which is why I think that balanced and fair minimum sentences
<BR>
(as well as maximums) are necessary.
