<EM>&gt; The England and Canada murder rates were already low before their gun

<EM>&gt; Thus, their restrictive laws cannot be much credited with lowering their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crime rates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Murder rates in England, Canada, and Japan have risen since passing their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun control laws.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have read that In England the gun crime rate is up 10.9% after the gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do not say (like ancient latins): ³post hoc, propter hoc²
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But this strange relation looks like the prey-predator pattern (Volterra¹s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equations, Rashevsky¹s patterns).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>And property crime rates are up, even higher than the preexisting rates
<BR>
that are far higher than US rates (as are Australian rates since their
<BR>
gun bans.
<BR>
<P>While its instructive that there is a measured 2% drop in crime for each
<BR>
1% of the population that carries concealed weapons, at least when
<BR>
comparing various US jurisdictions, the mere fact that violent crime is
<BR>
so much lower in the UK and elsewhere than in the US is to be considered
<BR>
more a matter of percentage of the population made up of low income
<BR>
minorities. Most crime here in the US is, in fact, minority on minority
<BR>
and poor on poor, and the US is some 30% or more made up of minority
<BR>
populations. Now, as minority economic results improve, the crime rates
<BR>
in those communities is decreaseing (whether this is strictly economic
<BR>
or a result of the population aging, which would also result in greater
<BR>
stability and earning power, is cause for speculation). The UK's
<BR>
population is only 7% minority, according to recent postings, and is
<BR>
crime is starting to be a serious issue there. 
<BR>
<P>I think some of Orwell's writing dating back to the late 1930's is
<BR>
instructive as to this phenomenon. At the time, he noted that there was
<BR>
a gradual increase in the number of east european jewish refugees in
<BR>
england. Now the traditional British politeness mandates that everyone
<BR>
politely wait in line to get on the bus or train, where the SOP in
<BR>
eastern europe was for the whole crowd to push and shove for the door,
<BR>
pell mell. When the number of eastern refugees was low, they were only a
<BR>
small percentage of the people waiting for the bus, so it was not
<BR>
difficult to assimilate them into the idea of waiting in line, but when
<BR>
there came large numbers of refugees, this british system broke down and
<BR>
chaos resulted.
<BR>
<P>I think in order to have an effect on crime, some percentage of the
<BR>
minority population of a society must be assimilable and upwardly mobile
<BR>
if that society is to retain a goodly amount of liberties in the hands
<BR>
of the people, while more stratified societies can get away with more,
<BR>
though in the long run risk either internal instability, or must engage
<BR>
in warfare to mask this instability and use up those who would be the
<BR>
players in such a civil conflict. This is noted in that although many
<BR>
european countries boast of low violent crime rates, they are at far
<BR>
higher risk of engaging in widespread warfare, such that in the last
<BR>
century, at least 30-40 million people died due to violence in europe
<BR>
during wars there (WWI, WWII, Spanish Civil War, Chechoslovakian and
<BR>
Hugarian Purges, Greek Civil War), while less in North America, less
<BR>
than 2 million people have died from violent crime during the same
<BR>
period, yet most europeans look at North America as a far more violent
<BR>
place.
