<EM>&gt;  &gt; Yes, I see that you want full access to all parts of your consciousness,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; and that one consciousness stream does not have full access to the other.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; The problem here is that you're not quite playing my game.  Under my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; definition, you DO have access to every part of yourself, and you DO think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; to yourself that &quot;I think therefore I am.&quot;  &quot;You,&quot; under my definition, DO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; have access to every consciousness stream that is you, DESPITE the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; that some of your parts aren't aware of the others, because &quot;you&quot; are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; set containing ALL of the consciousness streams.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are now redefining the word self to mean multiple, disconnected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entities.  This does not preserve my concept of self.  This merely requires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me to restate my goals using the new terms.  Instead of making my &quot;self&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immortal, I now need to state that I want to make those portions of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;self&quot; that I can access immortal, and ignore those portions of my &quot;self&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I cannot access.  Any system that deletes the portions of the &quot;self&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I can access and only saves those portions of the &quot;self&quot; that I cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access deprives me access to my &quot;self&quot; which is exactly what I want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; avoid.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, this translation isn't very good, since you made use of the word
<BR>
&quot;I&quot; in a way that my definition wouldn't endorse, since, under my
<BR>
definition, &quot;self&quot; and &quot;I&quot; to refer to the copy set, not to any particular
<BR>
consciousness stream.  But nonetheless, I see how such a translation would
<BR>
go, so I won't nitpick the point further.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You haven't explained how my goals are acheived with your system.  You have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merely relabelled your system to use the terms that I use.  (Freedom is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slavery!)  My goals are still incompatible with your system.  If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; redefine the terms, I will just have to restate my goals using different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terms again.
</EM><BR>
<P>True.  As I have suggested in a variety of disclaimers, if you're
<BR>
committed to this goal intrinsically, then there's no convincing you.
<BR>
However, I'd expected that you DIDN'T hold this goal intrinsically, but
<BR>
only extrinsically, that is, you hold it in light of some other beliefs
<BR>
that you have, so if those beliefs turned out to be false, you'd drop the
<BR>
goal.
<BR>
<P>If preserving control over this consciousness stream is your totally
<BR>
intrinsic goal, then nothing I can say will dissuade you.  However, it IS
<BR>
worth pointing out that, if your beliefs about what constitutes &quot;death&quot;
<BR>
and the &quot;self&quot; are wrong, then, as far as I can tell, your goal is totally
<BR>
unmotivated; there is no reason whatsoever to follow it.  Granted, this is
<BR>
a perfectly fine property for an intrinsic goal to have; intrinsic goals
<BR>
don't NEED external motivations. But it makes me wary, personally.  It
<BR>
makes me wonder if there isn't some sleight of mind at work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That is my definition of death.  But let me try to be clear:  I do not want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to avoid death.  I want to avoid having my current consciousness stream end.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If that is not death, than I don't mind death.  For example, I don't mind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dying, being cryogenically frozen, and then reanimated.  Maybe I died, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my consciousness stream still continued.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, taking a cue from John Clark, just how upset would you be if you found
<BR>
out that your consciousness stream had already been stunted?  In
<BR>
particular, suppose I told you that in the middle of the night last night,
<BR>
someone replaced your regular brand Newstrom with a copy brewed from
<BR>
Harvey freeze-dried crystals.  (By assumption, if nobody told you that
<BR>
this had gone on, you'd never know.)
<BR>
<P>As you can guess, I wouldn't mind this a bit if it happened to me.  And
<BR>
while I think most of us would certainly find this state to be a little
<BR>
odd, it seems to me that, if this goal is all that important to you, you'd
<BR>
probably be pretty upset to find out that this had happened.  Would you?
<BR>
<P>Would you feel any more or less upset if I instead told you that someone
<BR>
had made a copy of you and then killed him?
