<P>
Hear, hear...It helps to have strong transhumanist beliefs, though
<BR>
not always. In the end it's all about chemical (dis)balances, and
<BR>
mental illness can smash even the most rational belief system
<BR>
to bits. Fortunately, most of us can rely on good old cowardice
<BR>
to keep us from suicide. Apparently Sasha was no coward...
<BR>
------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>The crux of the matter is that the human brain is a complex electrochemical
<BR>
system, and though it may sound overly mechanistic, it can break down.  We,
<BR>
as humans, may hope that we are beyond mere systemic failure, but to date
<BR>
we are not.  Some systemic failures are less upsetting (say, a heart-
<BR>
attack) because they do not effect the part of the body we hold to be the
<BR>
strongest and most supernatural: the brain.
<BR>
<P>There is no rational reason for Sasha to have killed himself, it in an act
<BR>
which is everything that Sasha was NOT: foolish, selfish, pointless, and
<BR>
without any future.  He would not have died at that time if he had rational
<BR>
control of his mental facilities.  Sasha was no coward, but suicide is not
<BR>
really a brave act, either.  Suicide is the result of a particular systemic
<BR>
failure in the nervous system, not a rational choice.  A suicide is,
<BR>
ultimately, not much more of a choice than a heart-attack.  Once can try to
<BR>
live a healthier life (as Sasha tried, with his penchant for eating healthy
<BR>
foods and taking vitamins, etc. and by trying to learn and think about
<BR>
positive,
<BR>
world-changing things rather than dwelling on depression), or one can clog
<BR>
one's
<BR>
arteries and mind with junk, but sometimes the junkies outlive the healthies
<BR>
for
<BR>
the simple reason that there is randomness in the universe and sometimes a
<BR>
heart
<BR>
or a mind or any other system, no matter how well cared-for, can just fail.
<BR>
Sasha did push the envelope in many ways, asking difficult questions and
<BR>
dancing
<BR>
all night long, etc. - demanding a lot of his mind and body - but I had not
<BR>
known
<BR>
him to deliberately try to destroy himself, just to try to drive himself to
<BR>
be
<BR>
better and stronger.  Maybe this was too much stress on his system, despite
<BR>
all
<BR>
the care he took to maintain his system otherwise.
<BR>
<P>Sasha was not a quitter, he was a fighter, and he had struggled through a
<BR>
lot
<BR>
of hard time in his life.  Sasha had strong transhumanist beliefs, good
<BR>
friends,
<BR>
a loving son, and tried to take care of his mind and body as best he could
<BR>
while
<BR>
still being Sasha.  Sasha's beliefs, friends, family, etc. didn't let him
<BR>
down -
<BR>
his electrochemical nervous system did.
<BR>
Unfortunately, even a strong mind and body like Sasha's can sometimes
<BR>
break-down,
<BR>
and more unfortunately, sometimes with fatal consequences.
<BR>
<P>People who cared about Sasha will be sad, and angry, and aghast with
<BR>
disbelief
<BR>
that this could have happened... but, ultimately, we will miss him and try
<BR>
to
<BR>
honor all the many, many good things he brought to people's lives before he
<BR>
died.
<BR>
<P>Live Long + Prosper,
<BR>
Stephan
