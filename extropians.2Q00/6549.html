<EM>&gt;Take eating pork, for example; the food laws of the ancient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Jews ought to have archeological repercussions.  Digging into a Jewish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;garbage pit ought to show no pig remains, and this is generally the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;case.  Some wanted to say the pork proscription argued that Jews had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an especially well-developed hygiene, or perhaps were revolted by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;behavior and appearance of pigs.  However, it has been found that no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one in the region was eating much pork.  Pig bones are rare anywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from that time; quite possibly there were economic reasons, such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the difficulty of herding pigs or of raising them in dry areas.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Jews shared with their neighbors a prohibition against pigs, and no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one can claim that this somehow made them unique.
</EM><BR>
<P>One suggestion I remember reading some years back was that pigs are 
<BR>
omnivores like humans and eat pretty much what humans eat--tubers, roots, 
<BR>
nuts, etc., plus meat when they can get it. They're not grazers or 
<BR>
browsers like sheep, goats, and cattle--they don't eat grass or bushes. 
<BR>
(IIIRC, the pig digestive system is often used as an analogue of the 
<BR>
human digestive system.)
<BR>
<P>Thus, in a subsistence culture, pigs would be seen as competition, not as 
<BR>
complementary. People would want animals that ate something that the 
<BR>
people couldn't, transforming that unavailable food into meat.
