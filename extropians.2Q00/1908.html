<P>It's quite a bit deeper than that. The ActiveX security philosophy is based on
<BR>
authentication certificates - you trust the program because you know who the
<BR>
author was. In Java, you trust the program because it runs in an emulated sand
<BR>
box and can not possibly do things the vm won't let it do.
<BR>
<P>What an ActiveX program can do isn't a function of the ActiveX runtime, it's a
<BR>
function of what the operating system does when an executable program accesses
<BR>
one of the kernel interfaces. So far as I know, there's no system in Win95
<BR>
for running programs with some particular set of privileges.  Making ActiveX
<BR>
programs as safe and flexible as Java programs would require a substantial
<BR>
amount of operating system support, and it's a bit misleading to suggest 'the
<BR>
only security hole is due to the release of an unready implementation.'
