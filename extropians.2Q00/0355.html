<EM>&gt;I didn't see any particular mention of Singularity in American version 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;either, but they did mention a consideration that organized human 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aggression may be obsolete by the time 2025 rolls around; an astounding 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;admission for military academies to make.

<P>Given the demonstration in the gulf war, it would seem unfeasible any military could launch a credible conventional battlefield assault against the U.S. and its allies.  Weapon development, of course, has not remained frozen.  The autonomous armaments appearing in the pipeline would seem to increase this likelyhood.
<BR>
<P>As a result, as many members of the list are probably aware, the military is beginning to advance their capabilities for conducting urban warfare against smaller groups.  Its usually called MOUT, military operations in urban terrain.  Or something like that.  In response, they are initiating something called the Smart Sensor Web initiative with the purpose of providing real-time information from an array of sensors down to the lowest echelons (individual soldiers and squads).  The intent is to get inside the enemey's cycle times, which get shorter all the time.
<BR>
<P>If these trends continue, it would seem the military is preparing for singularity-enabled warfare.
