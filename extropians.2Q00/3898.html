<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Who owns the roads???  Whoever provides the roads sets the policy re
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; insurance - or can if they choose, and they probably will, as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;otherwise they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; might either find themselves stuck in ligigation or without customers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There are a number of different roles in this case, the drivers, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;road
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; owners, the car owners, and the insurers of the drivers, roads and cars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Each insurer sets its own policy, of course. But I think KPJ was asking 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; happens in case where there are incompatible policies. One extreme 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;example
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be if a driver who has no insurance at all is responsible for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; substantial amount of damage (way above what he can compensate for).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Most people have clauses on their policies to cover in the event of an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;uninsured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;motorist. Here in NH its quite typical, because you are not legally 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;required to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;car insurance unless you've been in an accident with x amount of damage 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;before, been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;busted for DWI. Otherwise, insurance is usually mandated by the institution 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;finances your vehicle purchase. If you paid cash for your car, and you have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a clean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;record, you have no legal obligation to be insured. Because of this, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;uninsured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;motorist clauses are common, though I imagine they might not be in regions 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;states that have laws similar to ours.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The situation here in NH is much as I would expect in a libertarian 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;society, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those that are insured would have clauses on their policies to cover in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;event of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an incident of some sort with an uninsured entity. I'm sure that in such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;situation, like an accident the uninsured driver cannot pay for, you would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wind up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the cost being financed, and a lein put on the future earnings of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individual. Such leins would be part of the credit record of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individual, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;employers with their own insurance policies would be obligated by their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;insurance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;company to comply with garnishment orders.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Any accidents where the damage exceeded the ability of an uninsured 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individual to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pay for in their lifetime would likely be the sort of accidents that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;insurance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;companies would pay to research ways of minimizing with new technologies.

Yes, totally in agreement.  The road owners could adopt similar policies to 
<BR>
encourage usage - they would assume liability, essentially, or let it be 
<BR>
known to their customers that they were following a policy or not requiring 
<BR>
insurance in the kind of cases you mention, if it turned out to make market 
<BR>
sense - altho see my reply for other aspects.
