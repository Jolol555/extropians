Emlyn:
<BR>
<P>I agree with much of what you wrote in this thread, especially about 
<BR>
extropianism contemplating a flowering of diversity through technology.  But 
<BR>
I do take issue with this:

<P><EM>&gt; Another example might be social &quot;progress&quot;. The world hasn't really made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  much that could be called social progress in the last couple of millenia,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  with the &quot;average citizen&quot; living a shorter, poorer, less meaningful life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  than ever in history (actually, there is some debate a to whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  average agrarian society citizen, a peasant,  lived a worse life, but 
</EM><BR>
that's
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  a wobbly tangent). What society has managed to do is to accomodate 6 
</EM><BR>
billion
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  plus people in a more or less (less?) stable fashion; we (well, not 
</EM><BR>
actually
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;us&quot;) have paid dearly for this.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the point of view of the average person in the developed world, the last 
</EM><BR>
few centuries has seen very real progress.  People are more free, better 
<BR>
educated, live longer and enjoy a level of material prosperity reserved in 
<BR>
former times only for kings and high priests.  Although in much of the 
<BR>
&quot;second&quot; and &quot;third&quot; worlds, things are still not nearly as good, there are 
<BR>
some dimensions of progress.  Perhaps a Mexican campesino isn't a great deal 
<BR>
better off than his pre-Colombian ancestors materially, but at least he 
<BR>
doesn't have to worry about being one of the thousands of victims of ritual 
<BR>
sacrifice demanded annually by the Aztec priest-kings.  The average Chinese 
<BR>
woman is certainly better fed and educated than her ancestors, and she 
<BR>
doesn't have to worry about being crippled with foot binding.
<BR>
<P>The Enlightenment did mark a real turning point in the development of human 
<BR>
society, one we're admittedly just beginning to implement on a wide scale.  I 
<BR>
think it's important to be clear that modern concepts of individual autonomy 
<BR>
and worth ARE hallmarks of progress.  And while we're on the subject of what 
<BR>
is and isn't &quot;extropian&quot;, I think those ideals are well within the definition.
