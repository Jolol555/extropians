<P>&lt;&lt; They also tried this in science fiction fandom, with truly disasterous 
<BR>
&nbsp;results.  FANs were by and large mostly libertarians to begin with, with 
<BR>
&nbsp;many strongly libertarian authors and novels to draw upon.  Sam's crew would 
<BR>
&nbsp;attend some seminar at an SF con and start harrangueing the speaker, 
<BR>
&nbsp;interrupting them and refusing to shut up or let them continue....  For a 
<BR>
&nbsp;while, even mentioning you were a libertarian could get you excluded from 
<BR>
&nbsp;parties. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
I don't know if scifi fans can really be termed Libertarians?  When I read 
<BR>
Drexler back in the 1980's It occured to me that once products could be 
<BR>
'brewed-up' in one's own garage with an automated nonfabricator; all one 
<BR>
would need is the software to drive the manufacture. That to me seemed to be 
<BR>
an economic foundation for ushering in a 'Libertarian Age' because literally 
<BR>
everyone could produce what they needed-almost.
<BR>
I am not so sure how long this will really take to reach this point. Certain 
<BR>
writers can be very conservative, or rather liberal to the point of 
<BR>
unconventionality, just to get attention or stir up the audience.  Most 
<BR>
scifer's as I have heard them called would like to be ''out there' in the 
<BR>
solar system pioneering, or hunkering down in some cybernetic paradise (who 
<BR>
wouldn't?) and I suspect that whatever political horse sounds like it will 
<BR>
give them that--they will ride that horse.
