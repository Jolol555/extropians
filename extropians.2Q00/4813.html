<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; A market can operate only in the absence of force. It works only because all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; of the decisions made by the participants are voluntary, and each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; participant makes local trade-offs in the way that best suits his own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; desires. The moment you introduce actors that have the ability to compel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; others to do things at gunpoint, this is no longer the case. Instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; evolving in the direction of satisfying the desires of all participants, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; system then evolves to satisfy the desires of those who have access to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; force at the expense of those who do not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; This is the argument for antitrust legislation, and I absolutely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; agree with you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then you're reading something I didn't write. Force means actual, naked,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shoot-you-right-now-if-you-don't-obey violence. Corporations can't do that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (at least, not in any country that has even a passable semblance of a free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market). A company can cajole, bribe, and try to outsmart you, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ultimately all of its power is based on voluntary transactions. 
</EM><BR>
<P>If I'm Microsoft, I can tell Dell to ship a copy of Office with every PC
<BR>
or I'll decline to license them my OS and put them out of business. If I'm
<BR>
IBM and I don't like something your startup is doing, I can do a search on
<BR>
my patent database, find a couple of dozen you could plausibly be
<BR>
violating, and - right or wrong - bankrupt you in court. Putting aside the
<BR>
issue of whether Windows is any good or whether Microsoft or IBM or
<BR>
whoever actually does or did things like that, should they be allowed to?
<BR>
Why would we want to let them? (Focusing for the moment on the last clause
<BR>
of: 'We didn't do it, and even if we had it would have been good for the
<BR>
economy, and even if it weren't good for the economy - screw you - we can
<BR>
do it anyway because it's not a crime, and even if it is a crime, which it
<BR>
isn't, it shouldn't be.')
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how hard it tries, no matter how unsavory its tactics become, there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing a company can do that will make it immune to the discipline of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market. Therefore, there is no need for anti-trust intervention in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well-developed market - in the long run even the most powerful company can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survive only by serving its customers.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the long run, as they say, we're all dead. Just because a monopoly
<BR>
can't last forever doesn't mean it can't do a lot of damage in the
<BR>
mean time.
<BR>
<P>But I feel like we're going round in circles... Haven't we had this
<BR>
conversation before? I don't disagree that government intervention
<BR>
should be minimal, but we differ as to what 'minimal' means. I'm sick
<BR>
though of this 'Janet Reno designing software' rhetoric, and the 'free
<BR>
markets solve every problem' nonsense - all this absolutist,
<BR>
hyperbolic bullshit. Gates isn't evil, he's just an asshole, and
<BR>
Windows wouldn't have succeeded if it didn't have some merit.  But
<BR>
they're not very nice people, and, having often watched them trample
<BR>
people smaller than themselves, I can't really muster much sympathy
<BR>
when they're abused by someone bigger yet. Live by the sword, die by
<BR>
the sword. I am not greatly moved by MSFT's uncomfortable discovery
<BR>
that the world is an unfair place or that it too can be the victim of
<BR>
dirty tactics. Nor will I shed a tear for the property rights of the
<BR>
richest man in history.
