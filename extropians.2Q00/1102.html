<EM>&gt; That's why the appeal of the Harry Brown book TOTALLY lost me ... hearken
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a better life back then... How good life was before it all got interfered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with by those darn civl rights laws. Hogwash.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; People are always going to whitewash the past.
</EM><BR>
<P>In general I agree with you. However, that doesn't mean you can always
<BR>
assume the past was worse than the present in every possible way.
<BR>
<P>As it happens, this particular topic has been rather well researched. Mike
<BR>
is exaggerating a bit, but it is certainly true that in the first half of
<BR>
the 20th century American high schools taught many subjects that are now
<BR>
considered advanced college fare. My favorite example is the fact that the
<BR>
material colleges now cover in three semesters of calculus used to be taught
<BR>
in high school as a matter of course. Much the same thing has happened in
<BR>
all of the sciences, not to mention literature and foreign languages.
<BR>
<P>Now, obviously that doesn't mean that every citizen of the day was actually
<BR>
proficient in all of these skills. It does, however, make it clear just how
<BR>
far our current system's standards have declined.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Things weren't so good for &quot;others&quot;.  Others have it better now, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not much -- oh yes, and at a cost to the middle class non-ethnic, white
</EM><BR>
male
<BR>
<EM>&gt; America. I know you have heard this before and discount it, but it's my
</EM><BR>
POV.
<BR>
<P>Funding a free high school education for every child in America, using
<BR>
1920s-era standards for materials, classrooms and student-to-teacher ratios,
<BR>
would cost maybe 10% of what we currently spend on education. If money had
<BR>
anything to do with the quality of education, we'd have the best-educated
<BR>
population in history.
<BR>
<P>Our current system has become just another example of political rent
<BR>
seeking. The goal of public schools (and teachers' unions, and the dept. of
<BR>
education) is to secure ever-increasing budgets. Individual teachers may
<BR>
care about the students, but the school system doesn't.
