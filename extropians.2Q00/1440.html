<EM>&gt; &gt;  Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a

&nbsp;He goes into it later in the post. I personally can't dissagree witht
<BR>
the logic either, even though I'm libertarian, I'm a libertarian of very
<BR>
Spartan sentiments. A man who has nothing worth dying for has nothing
<BR>
worth living for, IMNSHO. People who refuse to enlist or be drafted
<BR>
ought to be stripped of citizenship, as far as I am concerned. If you
<BR>
are contientious objector, thats fine, you can serve in the medical
<BR>
corps or some other non-combat role. I would prefer people that are that
<BR>
honest about their opinions than those who are a) cowards, b) too stupid
<BR>
to understand that the best place to hide from a war is often in the
<BR>
military. You are much more likely to be killed or injured if you are a
<BR>
draftee than if you join up. When you join up voluntarily you have some
<BR>
control over what you actually wind up doing, which can minimize your
<BR>
risk as much as you care.
