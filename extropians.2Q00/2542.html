<EM>&gt; &gt; If I had said &quot;hey, everybody on this list, I think we should all post 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; names, addresses and phone numbers.  You all go first, then I'll do so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; also.&quot;  And then if I refused to do so, *that* would be hypocritical.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that is not even close to what I have said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A large number of use HAVE done so. There are several directories of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transhumanists and extropians, Romana Machado's for example, where many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;list members are registered and give personal info and even pictures. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have done so. You have not. I wonder why that is.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are a number of reasons for that: (1) until your post, I had never 
<BR>
heard of those directories; (2) I have no desire to contact anyone on that 
<BR>
directory, or to have them contact me (other than through this list), 
<BR>
therefore I have no reason to join any such directory; (3) I am unaware of 
<BR>
any requirement to join any such directory in order to participate on this 
<BR>
list.  *That* is why that is.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; What I *have* said is that I think a transparent society will eventually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; become necessary, and moreover, I think it will be a good thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yet you hypocritically don't feel that way when you talk to your kids
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disclosing personal information over the web.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is nothing hypocritical about my expressed beliefs and my advice to my 
<BR>
kids.  Perhaps you should try reading my previous post again.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; My refusal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to give *you* my personal information does not contradict anything I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; said.  You and I exchanging personal information over the internet does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *not* a transparent society make.  It is simply a couple of idiots 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exposing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; themselves in public.  Your &quot;walk the walk, talk the talk&quot; nonsense is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; clearly just a &quot;dummy's dare&quot; to expose myself as you have done, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; simply decline that invitation.  That does not make me a hypocrite, a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;coward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or a fascist.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How is an open society acheived without voluntary action?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know that it won't happen voluntarily.  The obvious answer to your 
<BR>
question, for whatever its worth, is that if it doesn't happen voluntarily, 
<BR>
it will happen involuntarily.  How does that have anything to do with my 
<BR>
refusal to give *you* my address and telephone number?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;essentially saying is that you are calling for us, by your opinions, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all jump off a cliff, and you are promising that you are right behind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;us. Real leaders lead from the front. Only cowards lead from the rear.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's not what I have said at all.  I haven't said *anything* about what 
<BR>
*I'll* do.  For your benefit, I'll repeat *again* my position: (1) I think a 
<BR>
transparent society will eventually become necessary, and (2) I think it 
<BR>
will be a good thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;SO:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A) Orwell's idea of fascism matches with your opinions better than any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other I've seen.
</EM><BR>
<P>How so?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;B) You have proven your hypocirsy.
</EM><BR>
<P>How so?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;C) You are unwilling to lead fromt he front.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am unwilling to lead at all.  This is the *only* true charge you have made 
<BR>
about me.  I have never asserted myself as any leader of society.  From the 
<BR>
front, the back or the side.  I don't want the job.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&quot;Your honor, you cannot fail to return a guilty verdict on all charges.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>If this is true, &quot;your honor,&quot; thank God I still have a right to trial by 
<BR>
jury.  I submit the record to the jury of this list and am happy to abide by 
<BR>
their verdict.  As for Judge Lorrey, he can take a flying leap.
<BR>
