<P><EM>&gt; You've probably taken this into consideration, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would Dr. West's research tend to refute this hypothesis?
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, Dr. West, according to people at the LifeEx conference,
<BR>
this weekend has been fairly careful about what he has been saying.
<BR>
The lead person on the Science article however has not (and I've sent
<BR>
him a letter telling him just that!).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;Now, in a major new paper published in the April 28,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2000 issue of the journal Science (1), a group led by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dr. Michael West has reported what may be the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; revolutionary advance in cloning research so far. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have found that cloning can totally reverse cellular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aging.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.lef.org/featured-articles/apr2000_clon_01.html">http://www.lef.org/featured-articles/apr2000_clon_01.html</A>

<P>This is probably a misquote by the Life Extension Foundation
<BR>
*or* is a very specific comment regarding &quot;cellular aging&quot;,
<BR>
where that is defined specifically as the loss of telomeres.
<BR>
<P>I have no doubt that they have restored telomeres -- however
<BR>
restoring telomeres in cells that &quot;happen&quot; to have a mutated
<BR>
p53 gene is a recipe for causing cancer at a much earlier
<BR>
age than it might otherwise occur.  It will be interesting
<BR>
to see, once we have large populations of cloned animals if
<BR>
their cancer rates are higher (in addition to their
<BR>
miscarriages, post-birth death rates and deformaties).
<BR>
<P>You *also* may want to take into account that when researchers
<BR>
do gene knock-out's in mice they often end up with *no* effect.
<BR>
That is because they are discovering the biochemical systems
<BR>
have &quot;back-ups&quot;.  That makes perfect sense since it is thought
<BR>
that the mammalian genome is a proto-genome (of the Drosophila
<BR>
level of complexity) that has been duplicated twice.  So
<BR>
unless the functions of many genes have been diverted or lost
<BR>
there could be as many as 3 backups per gene.
<BR>
<P>So, the question you have to ask yourself after the accumulation
<BR>
of DNA damage (whether in your evolutionary history or in
<BR>
the formation of your body [DNA polymerase doesn't copy
<BR>
&quot;perfectly&quot;] or in your 20, 30, 40, ... years of life) is
<BR>
&quot;whether you feel lucky?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Well do ya?
