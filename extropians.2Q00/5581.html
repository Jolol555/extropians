Washington DC also has one of the most restrictive gun laws in the country. Name any other high crime city in the US, and you will find a city with extremely restrictive gun laws.

<P>As I've said before, almost everyone I have known personally that has visited europe has been robbed at least once while they were there, they've had their hotel rooms robbed, their cars broken into or stolen, and bags snatched out of their hands. 
<BR>
<P>The brazenness of theives in europe to me is incredible, and testament to the fact that they know there is little a person can do to defend themselves against robbery in europe. I've heard many stories of women mugged and raped with bystanders just walking by, ignoring what went on. Non-gun crime is so prevalent I believe that most people there just don't see it, or refuse to see it.

<P>It bothers me that my father who lives in New York City and is a former courier who carried a sidearm cannot now do so.  But he does live right next door to a large NYPD precinct house! lol  He likes to eat lunch at a local bar &amp; grill with a group of friends who are homicide detectives and share with him some juicy stories over food. 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>New York City and Washington D.C. are two places where lawful citizens should absolutely be allowed to easily get permits to carry a sidearm.  Would it lower the victimization rates I wonder?  It might also cause criminals to &quot;raise the bar&quot; to a new level of viciousness but, so be it.  I don't feel the need to carry a handgun in Anchorage but if I were visiting the big apple I would sure want one.
<BR>
<P>I have heard stories of severe thievery in Europe and on a sophisticated level that dates back centuries.  I did not know they suffered from apathy when it comes to intervening in situations such as an ongoing rape.  I know that has happened in the United States.  What parts of Europe are you talking about?
