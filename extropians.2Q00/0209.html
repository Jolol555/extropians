Later I wondered around Palo Alto while waiting for the next Caltrain. I 
<BR>
hadn't been there in a few years. On a saturday night, it's like fairyland. 
<BR>
Healthy and obviously wealthy people literally spilling out of every 
<BR>
immaculate restaurant. Someone went out of their way to pickup a pen I 
<BR>
dropped in the bustle. Even the sole homeless man seemed to be doing pretty 
<BR>
well. Reminded me of Santa Barbara, except that Stanford is where the ocean 
<BR>
would be, and the workers aren't mostly Mexican. Amazing what extraordinary 
<BR>
wealth can do. Don't imagine too many happy faces there today (NASDAQ 
<BR>
selloff).
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Your words really captured my imagination.  I wish I had been there to see 
<BR>
it myself.  It must be 'strange' visiting a community where there is such 
<BR>
wealth and yet the people are still 'friendly' and down to earth, at least 
<BR>
in part.  I have read about the nature of gated communities which some of 
<BR>
these people probably live in.  Ever read _Oath of Fealty_? lol
<BR>
<P>In Anchorage there is a generally high standard of living and some very 
<BR>
wealthy but there is plenty of poor and lower middle-class mixed in too.  Of 
<BR>
course the wealthy here like to have their own events and gatherings such as 
<BR>
the miner and trappers ball held during Fur Rondy.  People dress in very 
<BR>
expensive finery that harkens back to the turn of the century.  The ticket 
<BR>
price is relatively low at $100 per person but generally only those of a 
<BR>
certain 'station' attend.
<BR>
<P>As I read the paragraph I thought of the Bruce Sterling novel _Holy Fire_ 
<BR>
with its world of relative prosperity.  Perhaps in fifty years what you 
<BR>
described will be the norm in the developed world and not  fairy-like 
<BR>
exception.
<BR>
<P>I found your comments about the sole homeless man appearing to do well 
<BR>
rather funny!  Trickle-down economics?  And the observation about the 
<BR>
Mexican workers everywhere as rather eye-opening.  So, we still need our 
<BR>
cheap labor to keep costs down even if we berate them for trying to come 
<BR>
over here for a better life.  One day I will have to visit California for 
<BR>
myself.
<BR>
<P>When I lived in Louisiana and Mississippi for two years I got a very close 
<BR>
look at the polar opposite of what you described.  And the rich 
<BR>
upper-classes who lived surprisingly close to poor areas sure invested alot 
<BR>
of money restoring their huge antebellum homes.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
