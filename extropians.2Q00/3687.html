<P><EM>&gt; Emlyn and the Rocket Plumber are right here, of course.  This has been the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  vexing problem of IQ tests: how to measure raw intelligence versus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  achievement.  The latter is, obviously, a mix of raw intelligence and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  experience.  Someone who has gone to the best schools, had good parenting,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  etc. might score much higher than someone who did not go to the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  schools, etc. regardless of intelligence.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm living proof of that. I didn't go to the best schools and came from a 
<BR>
single parent family. Ive always had problems with the &quot;what of these is the 
<BR>
opposite of this word ?&quot; type of questions. My vocablary isn't exceptional 
<BR>
and if I dont know what the word means, how am I supposed to say what the 
<BR>
opposite is !!!. Right now I have a dictionary next to the PC so I can 
<BR>
desipher half of your e-mails.  :o)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  But within those limits, I think we can make measures -- even if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  measures are rough.  If one asks for absolute certainly -- or, here,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  absolute separate between factors, I think one is, for now, raising the bar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  too high.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  But, again, the problem is people link IQ test results too closely with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  self-esteem and think an average score means they are doomed to a less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  satisfactory life.  Perhaps if people linked self-esteem more with what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  limitations they could overcome than with perceived limits, then things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  would be different.  (&quot;Perceived&quot; here because tests can be wrong for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  number of reasons, including mundane things like a bad night's sleep before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the test.)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day I sat the entrance test for Mensa I was ill, I hadn't slept, it 
<BR>
was about the hottest day of the  year, I had to travel by train and 
<BR>
underground just to find out the test had been moved to a different building. 
<BR>
I could feel the IQ point dropping by the second.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its a mirical I passed !
