<EM>&gt; This level of sophistication is like nothing I've ever heard of before,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though certainly it's understandable that someone or some many would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inevitably address the cyber-security issue more seriously than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heretofor.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extropian wizards of digitalia check it out and let me know whether it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has promise, or is just the usual overconfidence.

<EM>&gt; Yours for a safety and security in  cyberia.  spike 8^}.

<P>This may be a good security program, but it is not apparent from the
<BR>
article.  The article claims that there is something new in this software,
<BR>
but it doesn't describe what it is.  Everything described in the article is
<BR>
old hat to security experts.  Some of the comments indicate that the author
<BR>
of the article thought things were new and unique that are actually common
<BR>
place in the security industry.  I would need more information before I
<BR>
could consider this to be anything more than hype over existing technology.
<BR>
<P>The ability to block &quot;live&quot; programs like the I-Love-You virus is trivially
<BR>
easy.  This means blocking V-Basic attachments, Active-X, Java, Javascript,
<BR>
or anything else that tries to download and run on your PC.  Most
<BR>
organization don't do this because they like all the special effects that
<BR>
these live programs can produce over the web.  The fact that this is the
<BR>
headline claim for this product announcement shows a lack of technical
<BR>
understanding in the area of security.  (The I-Love-You virus was really a
<BR>
Microsoft-specific backdoor that did not affect any non-Microsoft operating
<BR>
system or any non-Microsoft product.)
<BR>
<P>The concept of detecting port scans and patterns has been around for years.
<BR>
Any basic Intrusion Detection System does this.
<BR>
<P>The concept of integrating security into each common service, such as ftp or
<BR>
http, has been around for years.  Any basic set of &quot;wrappers&quot; does this for
<BR>
various services.
<BR>
<P>The article says it replaces agents periodically to make sure they have not
<BR>
been compromised.  This sounds like it doesn't know if it has been
<BR>
compromised or not.  Most Intrusion Detection Systems try to detect the
<BR>
intrusion beforehand.  Most system also have mechanisms (like matrix
<BR>
checksums and encryption) to mathematically prove that software is
<BR>
unchanged.  There is no need to keep updating it if it hasn't changed.  This
<BR>
system apparently can't detect whether software has been changed or not.  (A
<BR>
better method is to publish read-only media, such as CD-ROMS, to really
<BR>
prove that it hasn't been changed.)
<BR>
<P>The article also says it can choose alternate communications and tighten
<BR>
firewalls.  If the alternate communications are available and more secure,
<BR>
why aren't they used in the first place.  If they are not more secure, why
<BR>
switch to them?  If the firewall could be tightened without compromising
<BR>
service, why not do it first?  The usual answer to these questions is that
<BR>
services are disrupted or degraded in such a way that these actions are
<BR>
actually undesirable and won't taken until absolutely necessary.
<BR>
<P>The comment was made that existing systems scan for known attacks like virus
<BR>
scanners.  This sounds like the software authors are unaware of the
<BR>
heuristics in most Intrusion Detection Systems, Firewalls and even common PC
<BR>
virus scanners that detect new suspicious activity.  This is not a new
<BR>
concept.
<BR>
<P>The comment was made that humans aren't fast enough to protect against
<BR>
hackers, and that this new software would do it.  I know of know security
<BR>
systems that use humans in preference to automation.  Most systems fail over
<BR>
to humans only after the system fails.  This implies that the software will
<BR>
finally solve a historical problem that never really existed.
<BR>
<P>The comment was made that no central authority operates the agent.  This is
<BR>
either a misstatement or else there is no way to configure security without
<BR>
getting into every service on every server at every site individually.
<BR>
Centralized authority is good for security.
<BR>
<P>Also note that the software is not slated for release for another three
<BR>
years.  It will take three years to train it for home use.  If it is so good
<BR>
at dynamically detecting and adapting to real-time hacker attacks, how can
<BR>
it take three years to train for home use?
<BR>
<P>That's an eternity in Internet time.  The whole Internet might migrate to
<BR>
IPv6 or the Internet II backbone by then.  I'm not sure how any new software
<BR>
&quot;trained&quot; today could be useful in 2003, especially in the area of security.
