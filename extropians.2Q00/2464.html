<EM>&gt; Its not that I don't believe there are such things as victimless crimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (sodomy between consenting adults comes to mind), but when you think about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ultimate effect of many so-called victimless crimes, you begin to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that society itself is the victim many times.
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; In the more likely scenario where some form of public insurance is needed
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; supplement your medical care, the victims of your &quot;victimless&quot; crime are
</EM><BR>
(1)
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you, (2) those who care about you, and (3) taxpayers like me who are
</EM><BR>
paying
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for your expensive medical care.
</EM><BR>
<P>Zero, you've just hit upon one of the main reasons why thoughtful
<BR>
libertarians are often so adamant about insisting that there be no public
<BR>
welfare system whatsoever, no matter what.
<BR>
<P>Once you make the costs of individual decisions public, instead of insisting
<BR>
that they be borne by said individual decision-makers, the kind of thinking
<BR>
you outlined above starts to seem reasonable. But look where it leads:
<BR>
<P>The next logical step is to decide that since the public bears the costs of
<BR>
these private decisions, it is entitled to dictate which choice is made. The
<BR>
anti-smoking crowd is pushing this idea with considerable success at the
<BR>
moment, but the same logic would apply to any risky behavior - smoking,
<BR>
heavy drinking, doing drugs, scuba diving, skiing, recreational aviation,
<BR>
you name it.
<BR>
<P>So, we end up having endless public debates about whether skiing is more
<BR>
dangerous that scuba diving, whether snowboarding should be banned, and what
<BR>
regulatory approval should be required for owners of paint ball guns. But
<BR>
wait, what about purely financial risk?
<BR>
<P>After all, if I loose all my money in pork belly futures, the public will
<BR>
have to support me in my old age. So, by the same logic, we need to regulate
<BR>
every aspect of investment. We need to make sure that companies don't do
<BR>
anything too risky in the marketplace, so that their employees don't end up
<BR>
on welfare. We rules to make sure college graduates can get jobs, and that
<BR>
families don't have more children than they can feed.
<BR>
<P>Ultimately, there is no end to the number of things that need watching. The
<BR>
regulatory system will spread gradually, but inexorably, into every aspect
<BR>
of life, until in the end an individual's every action is governed in minute
<BR>
detail by laws backed by the threat of force. Not only has freedom been
<BR>
lost, but the generations who grow up under such a rule won't understand how
<BR>
such a thing as freedom could even be possible.
