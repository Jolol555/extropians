<P><EM>    &gt; Having two people think the same thing is different then having one person
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; perceive the thoughts of the other person.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and I can't perceive the thoughts of my copy because there is no other
<BR>
person, there is just me.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;If they thought different things, would one copy perceive the thought from
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the other through  telepathy?
</EM><BR>
<P>If they thought different things then there must be some difference in their brains so
<BR>
they are no longer copies of each other, they're just  twins, or perhaps just brothers.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; The very fact that they diverge seems to indicate that one consciousness is
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; not controlling both.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why? They diverged because something external happened to one and not the other.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;They fact that they were synchronized to appear identical for an
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;instant does not mean that they were one consciousness in two bodies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why not?
<BR>
<P><EM>        &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;All the proposed mechanisms (except one) that attempt to identify the
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;cause of  this huge change, like something special about my atoms or
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;something special about my position have been shown to be invalid,
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;&quot;the original&quot; and &quot;the copy&quot; are not well defined concepts nor can they
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;be used as distinct categories without  inconsistencies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;and the vague psycho-babble explanations for all this are so bad they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;not even wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; I don't know what change you are referencing here.  What changed?
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;From what  to what?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think anything changed but you think a change of cosmic proportions
<BR>
has happened, something has changed you into something not you. If true
<BR>
then this force or law or whatever you want to call it is the most important
<BR>
thing in the universe.  Every variable in it should be examined to try to figure
<BR>
out how this thing works.
<BR>
<P>EXACTLY what force (or what something) caused this profound change?
<BR>
Why can't science detect it? Does this same mystical force of yours operate
<BR>
in the real world, even if at a lesser intensity than in my thought experiment?
<BR>
How many atoms in your body can I change before this force kicks in and you're
<BR>
no longer the original ? How fast can I change them? How can atoms give us
<BR>
individuality when they have no individuality themselves?  EXACTLY how strong
<BR>
does this force have to be until you are no longer you and just become something
<BR>
that looks and acts and thinks and feels like you? Why isn't that enough for it to
<BR>
be you? Is identity or survival really a all or nothing thing? One last question,
<BR>
is there one particle of evidence that this amazing force even exists?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;I don't claim that the copies  can tell which is the &quot;original&quot; and which is the &quot;copy&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree. You could be a copy right now yet you would still feel the same way, you still
<BR>
feel a sense of continuity. A copy of a copy could be made and still nothing important
<BR>
would change. If I made a billion copies a second and destroyed a billion copies a
<BR>
second from the day you were born there would be no change in the subjective
<BR>
feelings you experience at this very instant because as you say, you can't tell if
<BR>
you're a copy or the original, in fact the entire concept of &quot;the original&quot; is meaningless
<BR>
in this case. You would say that many trillions of Harvey Newstroms have died
<BR>
tragically, but you're still conscious, you still have emotions, you still have memories
<BR>
and you still have a feeling of continuity. For the life of me I don't understand what
<BR>
has been lost.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;I claim that each  copy can tell which is &quot;their&quot; body or consciousness
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;and which is the  &quot;other&quot; body and consciousness.
</EM><BR>
<P>ESP?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Your claim that the copy and the original are &quot;one&quot; is semi-mystical and
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;semi-unscientific.  It implies thought communication between disconnected
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;brains with no  scientific rationale.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a red tomato in my right hand and a red apple in my left hand, but I
<BR>
don't think the tomato is communicating with the apple telling it how to be red.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;In summary, even if your carefully controlled example were possible, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;so temporary, so useless for uploading, and so far removed from probable
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;upload scenarios, that I view this as a mental exercise only.
</EM><BR>
<P>I grant you that some of my thought experiments are a little far out but that's
<BR>
what you do when you test theories, you push them to extremes to see if they'll
<BR>
crack. Yours does.
