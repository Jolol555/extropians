<P><EM>&gt; This is something I've wondered. If liquid fuel is so much better, why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does the shuttle, the Delta, the Araine, the Titan, etc all need solid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boosters to get decent enough mass fractions to put decent payloads in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orbit?
</EM><BR>
<P>Solid fuel rockets are a good deal for launch from the deck.  Altho
<BR>
they have lower specific thrust (thrust per unit mass) than liquids,
<BR>
they have very good thrust per unit volume, which is important
<BR>
if you need to push something thru the atmosphere.  Sure solids
<BR>
and their pressure vessels are heavy, but consider that they dont
<BR>
need to go all that high, and they are good for recovering and
<BR>
refurbishing.  Doug Jones may have a comment to make regarding
<BR>
this, but in general solid rocket strap-ons are a good deal for
<BR>
launch vehicles.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I was wondering if people were biased toward hydrogen merely for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purists sake. Sure you get great Isp, but you get great Isp from an ion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engine too, and you wouldn't want to power a launch system with an ion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nah.  While ion engines have enormous specific thrust, they have very
<BR>
low total thrust.  Makes for good orbit transfer vehicles, since you have
<BR>
plenty of time, but no good for launchers, even with any imaginable
<BR>
breakthrus.  What say ye, Doug?  spike
