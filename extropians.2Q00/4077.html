<P><EM>&gt; Personally, I don't like either very much, but I have a differing opinion 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  about skill level. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Picasso began as a perfect realist, and he was a master painter at 16 --  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  then he got bored with that and he branched off into all those different 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  styles and periods, while Van Gogh struggled all his life with the 
</EM><BR>
technical 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  aspects of painting, lacking in motor skills, but having much passion for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  work and being more consistant in his improvements. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn't aware that Picasso started this way, do you know of web sites 
<BR>
showing his earlier realist work ?.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  But why would we want to talk abotu such old dea art? Whats happening 
</EM><BR>
NOW?? 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  year 2000??
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, thats a good question. There is a lot of surrealist digital art 
<BR>
around. I do like the &quot;magic eye 3-D&quot; type of pictures, but its difficult to 
<BR>
judge there artistic value (same old story). The fastest moving from of art 
<BR>
as always is music. It is still keeping a steady pace with technology. I 
<BR>
wonder what the top ten of 2050 will soundlike ?. Perhaps the link between 
<BR>
visual art and sound will become even closer. I would imagine so. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not so hard to imagine that art in the future, art will be more 
<BR>
interactive and relative to the viewer. Pictures and music that change 
<BR>
according to mood etc. A bit like people today changing there computer 
<BR>
desktop to suite there mood.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are your views on art today ?.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex.
