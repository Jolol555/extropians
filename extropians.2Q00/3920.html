<EM>&gt;From: <A HREF="mailto:QueeneMUSE@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20PHIL:%20Egoism%20(Was%20ART:%20What%20Art%20Is)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000528171952.82477.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">QueeneMUSE@aol.com</A>
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;When I think of her I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;struck with an image of a bitter, psthologically stricken person who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;survived
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;traumatic injuries in her homeland and came here to work through her 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;psychic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wounds by outpouring onto paper. What she promotes is largely distrust,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dislike, disdain, contempt, scorn, and loathing. For meny many things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is not my style of thought, I am a person who loves.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose I can see how her ideas on &quot;egoism&quot; might lead an others-centered 
<BR>
person (such as, apparently, yourself) to view her ideas this way.  In fact, 
<BR>
initially, her ideas struck me as narcissistic and selfish.  But I've 
<BR>
gradually come to believe that narcissism and, particularly, selfishness 
<BR>
have traditionally gotten a bad rap.
<BR>
<P>Coming from years of fundamentalist Christian indoctrination, I was heavily 
<BR>
on board the &quot;love your neighbor as yourself&quot; rap.  So when I came across 
<BR>
Randian egoistic ideas I bristled.  But the more I thought about it, the 
<BR>
more it seemed to me that an openly selfish person would (generally 
<BR>
speaking) be a more honest and productive member of society than someone who 
<BR>
proclaims to be all about loving others, helping the less fortunate, etc.
<BR>
<P>Why more honest?  Well, as I see it, do-gooders one and all are not in the 
<BR>
business of doing good for others for the sake of others, so much as for 
<BR>
their own sake.  For many people, sacrificing for other people makes *them* 
<BR>
feel good.  Take me for instance.  I work hard all week and make a pretty 
<BR>
good income and, if I splurged it all on me, I could live a pretty high 
<BR>
lifestyle.  But instead I spend the bulk of my income on educating my kids, 
<BR>
providing them (and my wife) with a home, and investing the money (in part) 
<BR>
so that my family is financially secure.  (Admittedly I'm also saving for 
<BR>
*me* too, so I don't have to work until I'm 80, but you get the point.)  So 
<BR>
why do I &quot;sacrifice&quot; my own immediate pleasure for the sake of those I love? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, primarily because it makes *me* feel good about myself.  I would 
<BR>
feel like a louse if I didn't provide for my kids.  Yes, in fact I would 
<BR>
*be* a louse -- but the point is if I could *be* a louse without *feeling* 
<BR>
like a louse I just might go for it.  But if you ask most people why they do 
<BR>
good for others they will most likely tell you they are doing it just to 
<BR>
benefit others, as opposed making themselves feel better about themselves.
<BR>
<P>Why more productive?  Well this one is explainable with a short analogy:  
<BR>
Who would you rather have, 100 Bill Gateses or 100 Mother Theresas?
