<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Ahem: Champagne and Burgundy are _regions_ of France. Their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;produce is appelation controlee, meaning it's graded by quality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;This is to  some extent a hold-over from the agricultural age,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;and you'll note the tendency to name modern wines by the grape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;they're produced from -- which  isn't a controlled designation.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;If someone in California makes wine that is indistinguishable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;from champagne to a panel of tasters in a double blind test, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;is champagne, and they should be free to call it that. 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;By that reasoning, if I can make an operating system that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;indistinguishable from Windows (presumably by reverse-engineering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;all their APIs), I should be free to call it Windows. Right?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Accepting the claims of the French for 'cultural heritage', when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;that 'heritage' is nothing more than a desire to maintain their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;elite attitude as being the 'superior culture' of the planet is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;ludicrous.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Nonsense. Appelation controlee status is just a variation on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trademark law, one that you don't recognize because you're a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parochial-minded American with very little experience of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;outside world.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Calling Californian bubbly &quot;Champagne&quot; is an attempt to violate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the regional trademark.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nonsense. The standard for producing Champagne is internationally
<BR>
recognized. It is by definition produced by me'thode champenoise.
<BR>
They are produced in a variety of places around the world. It is
<BR>
the method of production, not one isolated region that make the
<BR>
difference.
<BR>
<P>Upstate New York produces some excellent champagne for example.
<BR>
(try a Gold Seal Blanc de Blanc sometime.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This is an entirely different issue from trademark law, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;variants thereon like the appelation controllee stuff (which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doesn't exist in the USA but is widely recognized as having the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;weight of trademark law elsewhere in the world).  Incidentally, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can be argued that those Californian bubbly producers who call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their produce Champagne have exactly the same relationship to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;real thing that Chinese software pirates have with Microsoft:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they're simply infringing a form of intellectual.
</EM><BR>
<P>More nonsense.
<BR>
<P>Appellations exist in the U.S. and every other wine producing
<BR>
country in the world.
<BR>
<P>Try an outstanding Australian Shiraz/Syrah while your at it.
