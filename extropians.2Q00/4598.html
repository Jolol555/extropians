<EM>&gt; requirements, requiring typically a couple thousand up to a as much as 5% of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electorate sometimes to get something on the ballot.
</EM><BR>
<P>A project such as this would require information of the ballot requirements for each
<BR>
state and nationally be determined.

<EM>&gt; I play around at policy.com and opinion.com, and I email my federal legislators
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least on a monthly basis, usually in opposition to some tyrannical law people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in DC are trying to pass. I think that the way politicians treat polls and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; letters from constitutents is sort of an informal referendum process. The fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a couple of them still remember when they nominated me to one or another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; military academy, and that I'm a voting veteran, helps make sure they pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attention.
</EM><BR>

<P>You are an active citizen.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do find that local legislators, oddly enough, seem to fall through the cracks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of public oversight. There are some that try to fly under the radar, so to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speak. Nobody knows who they are or what they look like, they don't make public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; announcements or cause controversy, and usually run unopposed, or run opposed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people even less known than they are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Bear in mind that politics are incredibly media-driven, and often media-drivel, and
<BR>
that the small town media will have its own system for small town policitians.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some referendum systems only allow the public to vote on whether to submit the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proposed law to the legislature, while others overrule the legislature, and can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only be Vetoed by the Governor.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't seen any site that details completely each state's and significant
<BR>
locales' and the federal systems for any kind of citizen action.  That would be good
<BR>
to have, and the ditribution of that kind of information would be beneficial for
<BR>
grassroots activists generally, who generally have a cause, and often a case.
