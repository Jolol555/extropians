<P>
<EM>&gt;To me Divinity is what you make of it. Through religion you can become quite 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;empowered, as well as disempowered. There are many methods and traditions, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each equally valid. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm curious as to your definition of &quot;valid&quot;.  Valid in what way?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Perhaps you are wondering if I &quot;believe&quot; in an outside 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;God. God is real because He affects me, indirectly through His worshippers 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who &quot;believe&quot; in Him. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't you mean that he's real only to you?  Then if you weren't around to
<BR>
be affected, would he never exist?  Would that mean that each person could
<BR>
have their own god?  You're losing me.....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I personally don't acknowlege any kind of objective 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reality, but nor do I reject one. 
</EM><BR>
<P>But surely an objective reality isn't dependent on acknowledgement, as it
<BR>
would exist independent of my wishes or awareness?  And how does that
<BR>
relate to the existence of a god?  Also if the effect of a god is how you
<BR>
define him as real, doesn't that mean he isn't necessarily objectively
<BR>
real, because if we possibly don't exist in an objective reality, then he
<BR>
can only be subjective at best?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Gods are &quot;real&quot; because they affect me, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just as &quot;capitalism&quot; is real, &quot;homosexuality&quot; is real, &quot;mental illness&quot; is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;real, etc. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ronin Cuervo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>But Santa Claus affected me, as did the Bogey Man, Tooth Fairy, the Hell
<BR>
concept, the Heaven idea etc....  I've not yet seen proof that they exist
<BR>
in either subjective or objective realities.  Plus the fact that they were
<BR>
created by people, regardless of the surrounding reality.
<BR>
<P>Also, capitalism, homosexuality and mental illness don't affect all people
<BR>
in the same way, or to the same degree.  Does that mean that god is somehow
<BR>
less real for different people?  So therefore he only exists if I believe
<BR>
he affects me?  What defines his reality as anything different from the
<BR>
other items listed?  It seems to me that if all is subjective, then
<BR>
anything proposed is at best subjective.  But if an objective reality is
<BR>
the one we live in, then evidence becomes a valid concept, and a
<BR>
requirement for acceptance of an idea.
<BR>
<P>It's late, I'm tired.  Nighty night all,
<BR>
<P><P><P>James......
