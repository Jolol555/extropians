<EM>&gt; &gt; In our vast understanding of macroeconomics we have lost sight of something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rather fundamental: What is money? Let us ask our master:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Responding to a question by Congressman Ron Paul (Rep., Tex.), Federal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan spoke to the subject of the  nation's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; money in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on February 17, 2000:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;[...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Question by Dr. Paul: &quot;So it's hard to manage something you can't define?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Answer by Mr. Greenspan: &quot;It is not possible to manage something you can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; define.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think when you look at Greenspan's full analysis, his point is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Fed is no longer constructing its policy strictly around attempting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to monitor and regulate the growth of the monetary aggregates M1, M2,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and M3.  They recognize that none of these are fully suitable as a proxy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for &quot;the money supply&quot;, a poorly defined term whose meaning changes with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the context.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you cannot define money, then you cannot define real-world economics, 
<BR>
let alone manage it. And just when did idea of a command economy even 
<BR>
gain creedence? By what right does the Fed, a private corporation, 
<BR>
gain the ability to &quot;keep the economy running smoothly&quot; or roughly or 
<BR>
in any manner whatsoever? 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Rather, the Fed is basing its decisions on a larger set of statistics that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reflect economic activity.  They are still trying to keep the economy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running smoothly and avoiding extremes of either growth or recession.
</EM><BR>
<P>We are far, far past that point already. The &quot;money&quot; has already been 
<BR>
created, *quite* knowingly by the Fed (despite its propaganda to the contrary,
<BR>
see above), its members, the GSE's, the monetization of ESOPs,
<BR>
and no one even knows how else. It is now just a game of musical chairs, each
<BR>
agent trying to find a seat as the dollar seeks its natural value, which 
<BR>
is zero. In this new game the Fed's actions can only change the rules in
<BR>
a limited degree- they can help out their owners and the friends of their 
<BR>
owners, which of course is their mandate and reason for existence.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I think this is so? Although past performance does not guarantee 
<BR>
future results, the Federal Reserve Bank/Corporation/System has acted in
<BR>
this manner from its inception. 
<BR>
The Rothschild's were instrumental in creating
<BR>
this unconstitutional abomination, let's ask their opinion:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Give me control over a nation's currency, and I care not who makes its laws.&quot;
<BR>
-- Mayer Amschel Rothschild, 1743 - 1812)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; But they recognize that with the tools we have today you can't do it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just by looking at M1 &amp; company.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hal
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course not! There are no such tools as they would require measuring the 
<BR>
parameters of mass hallucination and mass delusion.

============
<BR>
ORO (11/13/99; 21:24:14MDT - Msg ID:19061) ...You may have seen the movie 
<BR>
Matrix. The story is of humanity being used as production plant for something,
<BR>
the people live a life completely within their heads, controlled by computer 
<BR>
simulations. The key to the hero's survival and success is realizing that 
<BR>
the world around him, in which he grew up all his life, is completely false. 
<BR>
Walking through a room full of people trying to free themselves from the 
<BR>
images bombarding their brain, he crosses a kid bending a spoon. He asks 
<BR>
the kid, how did he bend the spoon. The kid says, it's simple, there is 
<BR>
no spoon.
<BR>
<P>What is played before us in the world is a hoax that you have been conditioned 
<BR>
by daily experience to accept as reality. But there is a cost to the charade 
<BR>
and a cost to you. But you can't bring yourself to come to the conclusion 
<BR>
when you watch CNBC, read the Journal or Investor's Business Daily, see 
<BR>
Moneyline, Ruckeyser, etc. that they are involved in a theatrical production; 
<BR>
that they are like well trained actors in a drama about money that never was.
<BR>
<P>Remember: There is no spoon.
