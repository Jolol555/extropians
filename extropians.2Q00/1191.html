<P>
Thanks for your &quot;timely&quot; reply, Robert. Regarding the fantastic difficultly 
<BR>
of regathering dispursed information, such as our conciousness, I have to 
<BR>
aggree with you. Which leads me back to the often dis'ed Godel paper on time 
<BR>
travel paths using Einstein's general relativity in a very slowly, rotating 
<BR>
universe. Curiously enough, I came across a re-submitted paper in General 
<BR>
Relativity-Quantum Cosmology (arXiv:gr-qc/9907007 v3 18 Apr 2000) by Tufts 
<BR>
University cosmologist, Ken D. Olum. His paper is The Ori-Soen Time Machine. 
<BR>
<P>Sincerely, Mitch

<EM> &gt; What I m the focusing on the obscure and strange notion of 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 'resurrection' that can be outlined in a pure, materialist, physicalist, 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; objectivist, hypothesis.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I've thought very hard about lifespan extension, the technologies
<BR>
&nbsp;involved, and the possibilities &quot;around&quot; the fatality of death
<BR>
&nbsp;for ~8 years.  I can see no basis for the classic &quot;resurrection&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;hypothesis.  I can see a clear path for reanimation if you don't destroy
<BR>
&nbsp;the body.  Once the body is gone however (or most of the greater
<BR>
&nbsp;than molecule sized pieces), I can't see how you would recreate it.
<BR>
&nbsp;It becomes simply an information theoretic question about how
<BR>
&nbsp;much you have to disassemble it before the information contained
<BR>
&nbsp;in it can no longer be reassembled accurately.  *If* and its a
<BR>
&nbsp;very big *if*, you have a computer larger than the universe that
<BR>
&nbsp;is running the simulation, you *might* be able to run it backwards
<BR>
&nbsp;and recreate everyone.  But I believe that has to be an existing
<BR>
&nbsp;precondition, which is in the realm of faith and not things we
<BR>
&nbsp;can engineer ourselves.  It is also very questionable whether
<BR>
&nbsp;you can run the universe backwards given information loss down
<BR>
&nbsp;black holes (oops, there goes the last atom of Spudboys's old body...)
<BR>
&nbsp;and the random choices that get made by things operating at the
<BR>
&nbsp;quantum level *and* the limits dictated by chaos theory.  I suspect
<BR>
&nbsp;you would have to have a very big computer and you would get a multitude
<BR>
&nbsp;of &quot;backward&quot; running universes.  Which one do you want -- the one
<BR>
&nbsp;where you exist or the one where you don't?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I am concerned with that amongst our August group (or anywhere else) there 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; appears to be a dearth of such intellectual creativity on this admittedly, 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; unusual, topic.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;Well, Anders' IQ is about 10 points above mine and I think he is in
<BR>
&nbsp;the same camp I'm in on this scenario.  That means it requires someone
<BR>
&nbsp;on Tipler's level to begin to tackle the problem.  There may be a few
<BR>
&nbsp;people like that lurking amongst us, but most of them have better things
<BR>
&nbsp;to do with their time.   You are talking a very small set of people with
<BR>
&nbsp;this brain power.  Probaly only a few thousand of them on the planet.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Moreover, I believe that this line of study would make 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in-roads with the general public. I mean, if you have at least pointed the 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; way out of permanent death, then nonotech and macro-engineering would be 
</EM><BR>
much 
<BR>
<EM> &gt; easier to gather support for.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I *can* point out a complete engineered path out of permanent death
<BR>
&nbsp;up to the limits of the best understanding of the lifetime of the
<BR>
&nbsp;universe (when the protons decay).  I can even punt when it comes
<BR>
&nbsp;to SI level brain power being able to (maybe) create altiverses
<BR>
&nbsp;and tunnel us into them.  I cannot however find any way to
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;resurrect&quot; individuals currently dead and not cryopreserved.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;My impression when I explain this path to people is that they
<BR>
&nbsp;lose all standard frames of reference and don't have any idea
<BR>
&nbsp;what to do with it.  People have a hard time supporting things
<BR>
&nbsp;that they really don't understand.  So I usually have to punt
<BR>
&nbsp;and say you are going to live two thousand years (on average),
<BR>
&nbsp;be fabulously rich and spend most of your time redesigning your
<BR>
&nbsp;larger-than-Gates-style mansion while complaining all the time
<BR>
&nbsp;about the prices the nanobots are charging you for construction.
<BR>
&nbsp;Most people *even* have a hard time with that.
<BR>
