<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Watched a TV program the other night on the efforts by cleaning and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;maintenance staff in Silicon Valley to earn enough to cope with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;explosion in rents and other prices in the area. The poor buggers seemed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be working as hard as humanly possible, two jobs cleaning, mother and kids
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sleeping in the one shockingly expensive room... I guess if you paid them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;more they'd work *really* hard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If they were &quot;smart&quot;, yes. I put &quot;smart&quot; in quotes because it is too simple 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another answer is to get a new job. Find out what you want to do, find out 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what skills you need to do that, and attain those skills. Anyone, with rare 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exception, is capable of doing this.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Anyone who's working 12 hours a day, and commuting another 4, because you live
<BR>
2 hours from work in an area with shoddy public tranportation, all of this
<BR>
just to make ends meet?  And don't forget supporting the kids.  Throw in not
<BR>
knowing the English language well, because you moved here from a country where
<BR>
jobs are hard to get and even lower-paying than what you have here.  So you're
<BR>
physically exhausted, and hampered by language, and never that well educated
<BR>
in the first place, and you're supposed to bootstrap yourself into the New
<BR>
Economy?
<BR>
<P>And, of course, some people seem to just not be as smart as other people.
<BR>
Especially in abstract symbolic manipulation.  Infinitesimals and Turing
<BR>
machines weren't part of the evolutionary environment.
<BR>
<P>Exercise: tie this into the &quot;Extropians and PR&quot; thread.
