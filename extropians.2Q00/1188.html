<P>Zero Powers said:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Murder is *already* a capital offense, even if you are wearing a cop
<BR>
uniform 
<BR>
at the time you commit the murder.  So I assume what you are suggesting is 
<BR>
some sort of summary execution which bypasses the jury trial process, right?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds like a really great plan.  Oh, except for the minor detail 
<BR>
that *no one in their right mind would become a cop*. I'm amazed that they 
<BR>
can hire people as cops now to get paid marginally well to risk their lives 
<BR>
every working hour of the day.  And now, in addition to getting reprimanded,
<BR>
<P>suspended, fired and sued for making an error, you think they should be 
<BR>
*killed* too?  Yeah, sure I might take that job...if it paid $10 million a 
<BR>
year.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Just had a meeting last Friday with the California Highway Patrol, Office of
<BR>
Research and Planning (for work).  And they told me one of their highest
<BR>
priorities is Officer retention and recruiting.  Cant hire enough of 'em and
<BR>
cant get 'em to stay.  BTW, their other hot issues were pursuit termintation
<BR>
devices, traffic congestion (?? dont ask me) and handheld PDA's for
<BR>
paperless tickets.
<BR>
Zero is right on with his comments.
<BR>
