(Alfven

<BR>
&nbsp;more credibility?  It would seem to me that the data presented earlier in
<BR>
&nbsp;this thread would be equaly well explained by a universe infinite both in

&nbsp;time and in space...

&nbsp;I dunno about the repulsive gravity though....

I read that book almost 10 years ago and found Alfven' theories very 
<BR>
beautiful. His ideas that filaments of electromagnetic streams just seem 
<BR>
pretty as the aurora, or spectacular as a fireworks display.  If I remember 
<BR>
correctly, Lerner attacked Heisenberg and related Heisenberg's ambivelence 
<BR>
towards the nazis to be somehow connected to his Uncertainty Principle. 
<BR>
Lerner also believed (at the time of publication) that areas out engineering, 
<BR>
outside of computers, had suffered because scientists and engineers bought 
<BR>
into quantum physics, so heavilly. Lerner blamed a slowdown in new inventions 
<BR>
because the most creative part of humanity also took on the under-current of 
<BR>
pessimism that Lerner felt expressed in Bohr and Hesinberg's analysis of the 
<BR>
world. As for me? My response is: Lerner is you a crazy man? &quot;Plasma? We 
<BR>
don't need no stinking plasma!&quot;
