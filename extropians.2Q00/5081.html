<EM>&gt; And Mike,  I wasn't offended or anything. I just wondered what the heck you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought slutty male information about GOP women would do for ME, a list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; member. I know if you go to the Beverly Hills Polo Club you'll see good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking republicans - a girl can go look at a rich young man in an Armani
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suit too. But I wouldn't post it on the list so all the Extotopian girls
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could find out and hopefully get laid.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I recall, I did say 'for the guys on the list' or something to that effect.
<BR>
If I didn't in fact say that, I apologize for creating the appearance that I
<BR>
presumed all list members would in interested, when that in fact was not my
<BR>
intention. I also realize that when someone says, 'hey guys' to a group, it
<BR>
seems to by default include everybody in the perceptions of some...
<BR>
<P>And I do admit to being insensitive and self centered. I do make rude humorous
<BR>
comments occasionally, however they are not meant to offend anyone at all. I'm
<BR>
just a kinda intelligent redneck with a sense of humor and little tolerance for
<BR>
other people's hypersenstivities. Seeing as how most of the things I like are
<BR>
seen as bad and evil by most of the population, I've developed a pretty thick
<BR>
skin to tolerate the language of others with regards to those subjects, though I
<BR>
do get my ruff up in a dander when someone is being purposely intolerant.
<BR>
<P>To close, I'll slip into crypto-guy-raphy so as to not offend the ladies on the
<BR>
list:
<BR>
<P>football forward pass, carbeuretor sixpack. D-cup, slapshot body check, venison
<BR>
transfer case. Gunrack, to six pack or keg? Funnel, bodyshot, tequila four by
<BR>
four...;)
