<EM>&gt;Do you know of any lists of important social (also economic, medical, etc.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems that are yet unresolved, but could possibly be resolved with some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yet-non-existent technology?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you were asked to name such problems, what would you say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are the most important?
</EM><BR>
<P>How about also compiling a list of important problems for which
<BR>
the &quot;solution technology&quot; is &quot;available&quot; right now, but not being
<BR>
implemented.
<BR>
<P>I put &quot;solution technology&quot; in quotes because any technology
<BR>
may be a practical solution for something, but if there isn't
<BR>
&quot;something&quot; (an element of that technology) that leads to its
<BR>
implementation, then it's not really a solution technology yet.
<BR>
<P>Similarly, I put &quot;available&quot; in quotes, because something can
<BR>
be available in the sense that it's been developed and proven
<BR>
to work, but for cultural reasons, people don't implement it.
<BR>
So, for practical purposes, it's not yet available -- even if it's
<BR>
published and available to anyone who can read.
<BR>
<P>Case in point: Ignaz Semmelweiz was the first doctor to
<BR>
advocate that doctors wash and disinfect their hands before
<BR>
treating patients. This was a &quot;solution&quot; to the problem of
<BR>
many mothers and babies dying from infections during
<BR>
childbirth.
<BR>
<P>For a period of about 30 years, Semmelweiz was ignored
<BR>
and/or ridiculed. So his &quot;solution technology&quot; (disinfecting
<BR>
doctors' hands) only became a solution 30 years after he'd
<BR>
proved its workability. Even though he'd published his &quot;solution&quot;
<BR>
and it was &quot;available&quot; in the sense that other doctors could
<BR>
read it, it wasn't really available because for cultural reasons
<BR>
it wasn't implemented -- until 30 years later.
