<P><EM>&gt; Been there, same thing happened to me.  I have since come to the conclusion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that this particular situation presents one of the few opportunities get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  direct and personal access to the reins of power.  So the thing to do is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  tell them what they want to hear, get on the jury, and do what you consider
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to be the right thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I recommend this to anyone reading this post, and recommend that you pass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the word to anyone who might ever find themselves with the opportunity to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  serve on a jury.  If you care, DO NOT tell them &quot;the truth&quot;, they'll boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  your independent-minded self as far away from decison-making responsibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  as they possibly can.  Spin it so you get in a position of power (again, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  you care), and then do what's called for.
</EM><BR>
<P>Over and over again I see people I want on juries getting themselves 
<BR>
disqualified by not being subtle about their answers during the selection 
<BR>
process.  This is often caused (IMO) consciously or unconsciously by their 
<BR>
desire to NOT spend the time and effort required to take part in the trial.  
<BR>
Of course you should be honest in your answers, but try to avoid expressing 
<BR>
extremely strong black-and-white opinions, and qualify your answers by saying 
<BR>
that you're sure you can follow the law and be fair and open-minded.
