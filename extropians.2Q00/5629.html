<EM>&gt; Many of the Amish have cell phones, faxes, and computers in their business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ventures these days.  Some of what has been described on this list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the Amish is out of date and colored by media reporting.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Amish aren't against technology per se, only against uses of it
<BR>
that are seen as unnecessary luxury or vanity, or that tend to separate
<BR>
the community.  Many communities, for example, have a shared cellular
<BR>
phone while individually owned ones are discouraged.  Fancy tractors
<BR>
are fine, but rubber tires are merely a luxury, and automobiles tend
<BR>
to separate people (though like a cell phone, a community might have
<BR>
a shared car for emergency use).
