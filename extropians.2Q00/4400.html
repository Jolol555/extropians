Thanks Rob, good work
<BR>
<P>The fact that it has survived in cyberspace so long is interesting in 
<BR>
itself.
<BR>
<P>This came across as so extreme I had to look it up.
<BR>
<P>A quick Google search reveals
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://urbanlegends.about.com/science/urbanlegends/library/blreno.htm">http://urbanlegends.about.com/science/urbanlegends/library/blreno.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>which claims this &quot;quote&quot; has been passed around the net since at least 
<BR>
1994;
<BR>
and:
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; It's a hoax. According to CBS, Janet Reno did not appear on 60 Minutes in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 1994. More to the point, even if she had made such an appearance and even
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; if she did hold this unlikely opinion, the Attorney General would not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; have dared publicly utter such impolitic words, which essentially
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; consign every practicing Christian in the United States to the status of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;cultist&quot; and a &quot;threat&quot; to the society.
</EM><BR>
<P>(not that I'd necessarily agree that she wouldn't have &quot;dared publicly
<BR>
utter such impolitic words&quot;, given her degree of political cluelessness,
<BR>
but if she had, I suspect we'd have long since heard the uproar through
<BR>
mainstream media.  Not that the quote isn't believable.)
<BR>
<P>/rs

<BR>
<EM> &gt; Yea .. we need cameras everywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;A cultist is one who has a strong belief in the Bible
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and the Second Coming of Christ; who frequently
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; attends Bible studies; who has a high level of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; financial giving to a Christian cause; who home
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; schools for their children; who has accumulated
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; survival foods and has strong belief in the Second
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Amendment; and who distrusts big government.  Any of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; these may qualify a person as a cultist but certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; more than one of these would cause us to look at this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; person as a threat and his family as being in a risk
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; situation that qualifies for government interference.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;

<EM> &gt; Janet Reno, Attny.  General of the United States
