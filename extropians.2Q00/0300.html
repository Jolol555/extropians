<EM>&gt; &gt; My fear is that we as a species will not morally evolve fast enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to keep up with our technology.  We will be the equivalent of 5 year olds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; who have learned to manufacture sub-machine guns.  Not a pretty picture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't know what the solution is, but I'm leaning more and more toward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; leaving the technology in the hands of Big Brother until we as a race are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mature enough to handle it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think this shows one of the major problems in this line of thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - because if Joe Q. Public is not to be trusted with a nanoassembler,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how can we then trust Big Brother? If humans are not morally evolved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough (whatever that means), then the aggregate of humans making up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Big Brother is also not likely to be morally evolved enough. And if a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maniac with nano gives you bad dreams, then try not to dream about a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nasty Big Brother with nano.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly. Government is not God. It is nothing more, and nothing less than a
<BR>
group of human beings who give themselves power and authority to do more than a
<BR>
common citizen is permitted to do by the rest of society. Government bureaucrats
<BR>
are individuals, and are just as, if not more, likely to be corrupted by power
<BR>
than by an individual who does not desire to be a part of a power hungry
<BR>
organization. In every instance where government gains power and abilities to
<BR>
cause more harm than is possible by a single individual, that government always
<BR>
uses it unjustly on at least an occasional, if not a frequent basis. The only
<BR>
exception is the use of nuclear weapons, but only in the sense of employment,
<BR>
not deployment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There is also another problem here, and that is that &quot;moral evolution&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (whatever that is; I agree that we have seen a trend the last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; centuries towards more human-friendly and &quot;nice&quot; moralities, but that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is no proof of an obgoing evolution towards something &quot;good&quot; and might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just be my own particular prejudices talking) might not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough. Imagine a world of saints, and one maniac with doomsday nano -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you get the same problem regardless of the average ethical standing of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people as long as the product of avaoilable destructiveness times the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amount of people times the fraction dangerous lunatics becomes large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough. To remain safe, you need to keep down the technology, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems very hard to do, keep down the population, which might be doable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but for other reasons, or keep the fraction lunatics as low as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible, which is likely even harder than keeping control over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology. After all, you can be a dangerous lunatic without knowing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it or being apparent to others.
</EM><BR>
<P>However, expecting one madman to be able to out-develop millions of benevolent
<BR>
nano-developers is not logical. Any and every offensive technology has a
<BR>
defense. That is one of the big truths of military technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As I see it, this dilemma is important. It is maybe one of the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worrying socio-philosophical problems of transhumanism. Banning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dangerous technologies seldom works, at least for those that require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficiently small investments to develop. Big Brother is not a viable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; option because of the risk of abuse.  Non-human regulatory systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like the nanarchy idea debated in the Good Old Days on this list has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same problem. It is not clear that balancing a powerful enough BB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a transparent society of little brothers is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible. Self-regulation probably works better than most people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realise, but only against threats that do not wipe out the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system the first time they are used.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are at least a dozen nuclear powers in the world, which include some
<BR>
countries that the popular press depicts as rather insanely led 'rogue' states.
<BR>
That nobody in 55 years has used one in conflict is a rather good testament to
<BR>
how sane and responsible most anyone can be when they gain a better sense of
<BR>
security and responsibility.
<BR>
<P>Its a rather easily understandable tautology that actual use of such weapons are
<BR>
a losing hand for everyone. The 'madmen' that the statists seem so scared of, so
<BR>
far as I can tell, have no hate for most people, it is typically state authority
<BR>
and state supported activities that these 'madmen' hate. Terrorism is not done
<BR>
in a meaningless manner, it always has understandable goals, and those goals are
<BR>
almost always a demand that a government stop committing some sort of crime that
<BR>
it has been getting away with. Considering the level of anarchy in the former
<BR>
soviet states, I would not be surprised if some terrorist organizations did not
<BR>
already have nuclear weapons.
<BR>
<P>The main reason most all terrorism exists is because statists refuse to
<BR>
acknowledge the legitimacy of the claims of abuse by disenfranchised
<BR>
individuals. Very few, if any, people commit violence for the sake of violence.
<BR>
Such people are sociopaths or psychopaths, and brain scans can easily detect
<BR>
such mental states.
<BR>
<P>I understand the worries of people like Zero and of Bill Joy, I just don't think
<BR>
the answer is to confiscate everyone's rights when their worries are about only
<BR>
a few. Develop a means to easily and inexpensively determine sociopathic or
<BR>
psychopathic states in people minds (f it doesn't exist already, which I think
<BR>
it does), and mandate that anyone who reaches the age of majority must pass such
<BR>
a scan to become fully enfranchised to utilize transhumanist technologies. If
<BR>
you want recertification once a decade and after any accident involving brain
<BR>
trauma, thats fine too.
