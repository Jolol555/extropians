<EM>&gt; I often wonder, those mornings when I and a host of others are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sweating like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crazy on various self-inflicted torture devices as treadmills,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stationary 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bikes, etc., how difficult it would be to translate all this wasted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into some sort of usable power.  And why no one has thought to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.  Every 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; morning in my gym there are about 100 people pedaling, walking, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pumping 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all those machines.  Does anyone here no whether it would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; translate any of that motion into usable power?

If you hooked up generators to the gym machines they would provide
<BR>
the mechanical resistance now provided by weights, friction devices
<BR>
or whatever, AND make useful electricity. 
<BR>
<P>See also Jonathan Sladek's &quot;The Reproductive System&quot; (especially the
<BR>
wonderful, surrealistic Las Vegas section) where a rampant
<BR>
AI/self-reproducing system has taken over Vegas and uses the gamblers
<BR>
themselves (thoughtfully provided with drinks and sandwiches)
<BR>
to generate electricity via generators in poker machines!
<BR>
<P>A hilarious book worth reading.
