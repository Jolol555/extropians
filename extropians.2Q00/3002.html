<EM>&gt; &gt; The fact that the US is one of the biggest emigre destinations on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  planet, I think, says a lot about who (as between Lorrey and me) is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  right about the nature of the US.  But, hey, in a debate as emotionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  charged as this one, who needs to be bogged down with something like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; factual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  reality? :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I think Mike has a heathly dose of paranioa, which is fine. As a UK
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizen looking to emigrate to the US I can say that personal freedom doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really come into the equation.  Here I am under almost constant survaillance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I drive to work there are cameras that  can read my number plate and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; store it, at work I am monitored by security cameras and likewise when I pick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up some shopping on the way home. my government monitors any e-mail I send
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and my calls at work taped.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I don't feel in the least comprimised or feel my civil rights have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infringed. This probably reflects the gradual introduction that has taken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place here, which has been heavily publicized in a positive light.
</EM><BR>
<P>Alex is living the life of a lobster who is well on his way to being
<BR>
well done, as he has bought the story that his cooks tell him that this
<BR>
is actually a hot tub spa made for his enjoyment and convenience... oh,
<BR>
this shell cracker? Well, thats just so we can give you a chiropractic
<BR>
re-alignment, really, its for your own good...pass the butter, please...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     If anything, I am worried by the higher rate of crime in the US and would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel safer if the level of survaillance was as great there as here. It looks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like the British Government has done a very good spin job on this subject as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it isn't an issue that the public are concerned about.
</EM><BR>
<P>As many of us have said before, the US has a small small fraction of the
<BR>
number of property crimes as the UK has, and overall violent crime is on
<BR>
a downward trend, while it is going up in the UK, as well as the fact
<BR>
that most crime occurs in the big cities. NH and VT have homicide rates
<BR>
equal to Britain while other crime categories are far lower, and many
<BR>
other states similar to ours have similar crime rates. The states and
<BR>
cities with the highest crime rates are the ones that put the greatest
<BR>
limits on the rights of the individual, which is not an accident.
<BR>
<P>I am free to say just about anything in my email (outside of making
<BR>
threats against the President), and it is not monitored. The government
<BR>
doesn't know how many jars of jam I buy at the market, and they don't
<BR>
know what route I take to and from work. They don't know who spends the
<BR>
night with me, and they don't know who I talk to over the phone.
