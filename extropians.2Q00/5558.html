<P>
Just a little story that wanted to write itself:
<BR>
<P><P><P>People always miss the obvious. 
<BR>
<P>Back in the 10's human germline engineering became practical. At first
<BR>
there was a general moral panic about how the rich would now create
<BR>
their own superkids, and a general wringing of hands over how some
<BR>
people would play God. Meanwhile, parents quietly went for holiday to
<BR>
nations where the procedure was legal, and returned
<BR>
pregnant. &quot;Genning&quot;, as people called it, became more and more
<BR>
affordable and over the years the obvious hypocricy undermined the
<BR>
bans.  After the taboo against gengineering vanished, the pendulum
<BR>
swung the other way. Modifying the genes of one's child went from
<BR>
official abomination to something everybody did but nobody spoke about
<BR>
to something fashionable to all the rage. Several suitably charismatic
<BR>
and outspoken geneticists became celebrities, parenting magazines were
<BR>
filled with articles on which apolipoprotein allele to choose and Time
<BR>
Magazine had the superhuman on the cover: an aloof, brainy, beautiful
<BR>
androgyne looking at the viewer seriously. While of course a great
<BR>
deal of people disagreed, most were enthusiastic about the next step
<BR>
in human evolution. It became the cause of generation Y: to be the
<BR>
parents of the superhuman.
<BR>
<P>The first &quot;superchildren&quot; were not that super. They just lacked most
<BR>
genetic diseases and genes known to cause trouble. Healthy, wanted
<BR>
children with a good life expectancy. Hardly any superhumans. New
<BR>
genes coding for extreme longevity, improved bodies and metabolism
<BR>
were found, but the children were still just very healthy, beautiful,
<BR>
tall and supple people who could expect to live until 200. More
<BR>
radical changes were possible, but very few parents wanted to subject
<BR>
their children to tiger fur, extra limbs or other exotica. Discreet
<BR>
adaptations like infravision and ultrasound hearing were briefly
<BR>
fashionable in the late 2020's, but that was all.
<BR>
<P>As genetics and cognitive neuroscience boomed, the race for the
<BR>
superbrain began in earnest. Improving memory and mental health was
<BR>
fairly straighforward, resulting in stable bookworms. Intelligence was
<BR>
another matter - while there were thousands of genes that could
<BR>
decrease it, there were few genes that individually could increase
<BR>
it. Complex schemes involving neurotransmittors, tailored new subtypes
<BR>
of neurons in the frontal cortex and developing schooling that would
<BR>
be optimal for the genes and vice versa were tried. The result was a
<BR>
lot of bright, overeducated kids - it was hard to see them as
<BR>
superhumans, even when they showed off their visualisation abilities
<BR>
or beat you in chess. The antigenetics people feared them of course,
<BR>
seeing them as cold plotters, but most were just normal if bright
<BR>
kids, just as likely to try to take over the world as the anti's own
<BR>
unmodified kids.
<BR>
<P>One problem with the brights was emotional problems. Many got tired of
<BR>
all the desiger schooling, or saw through their parents wishes. When
<BR>
they reached adolescence many had so creative teenage rebellions that
<BR>
the media talked about the emergence of &quot;the new Sturm und Drang&quot;,
<BR>
hoping for a harvest of romantic geniuses. While they certainly got
<BR>
enough moody teenagers that eloquently explained everything wrong with
<BR>
society, most people wanted happier kids. Hence the personality design
<BR>
revolution of the 40's.
<BR>
<P>Getting rid of schizophrenia, most kinds of depression and creating
<BR>
stable, happy personalities was the first step. Later parents wanted
<BR>
more refined sensibilities, greater creativity, more complex but at
<BR>
the same time integrated personalities. The result was a whole
<BR>
generation of children that were not born as full self-actualizers,
<BR>
but had a good chance of becoming it naturally. Even under harsh
<BR>
circumstances many of them prospered, reaching emotional maturity long
<BR>
before their parents had. In a few years kindergartens and schools
<BR>
became changed places, and many teachers reported that they had
<BR>
trouble handling these nice kids - they were used to a completely
<BR>
different kind. But while most people liked them, they were hardly the
<BR>
superhuman, the next step in evolution, people still eagerly waited
<BR>
for.
<BR>
<P>It appeared quietly, completely obvious in retrospect but unnoticed in
<BR>
its day. In 2047 EugeniX had found a genetic combination that promoted
<BR>
a sense of humor. It was popular, but most parents were much more
<BR>
concerned about getting the right adaptivity-enhancers or improved
<BR>
visual systems. In the middle 2050's people began to notice how happy
<BR>
the kids were. They were just as well adjusted as their elders,
<BR>
although a great deal more boisterous, but most importantly they
<BR>
seemed so content, so aware. And they were hillarious - instead of the
<BR>
old tired jokes, handed down through generations and stuck in a
<BR>
society generations gone, they invented completely new jokes. They
<BR>
invented new ways of joking. They took punning beyond mere language,
<BR>
and their practical jokes were marvels that left &quot;victims&quot;, spectators
<BR>
and the kids themselves laughing and smiling for weeks afterwards.
<BR>
<P>As the influence of the kids spread, society took on a noticeably more
<BR>
optimistic mood. Sure, the problems with antigenetics violence,
<BR>
globalising ecosystems, nanotech disarmament and dynamic network
<BR>
turbulence remained as bad as ever, but now people could smile at them
<BR>
and think that maybe there was a solution after all. It also became
<BR>
more and more clear that the new kids were not at all like their
<BR>
parents or older siblings. They were a new species, thinking and
<BR>
feeling in a somehow different but eminently likeable way. Their
<BR>
perspective on life was at the same detached and enthusiastic, as if
<BR>
everything was a huge wonderful joke they were telling right now with
<BR>
total concentration.  Some called them buddha-kids, others just the
<BR>
joy generation.
<BR>
<P>They were irresistible. While throughout the genetics era there had
<BR>
been firm resistance against modifications not to mention the idea of
<BR>
a superhumanity, the kids broke them down. You had to be bigoted to an
<BR>
almost psychotic level not to like the kids, and the firmest
<BR>
principles dissolved when confronted with their jokes. A few steadfast
<BR>
opponents remained, but for all practical purposes the battle was
<BR>
won. Hence, no parents would ever consider giving birth to a child
<BR>
without the humor genes.
<BR>
<P>Now only we old normals remain; everybody else is one of the laughing,
<BR>
immortal, smart people. While modern medicine might keep us alive up
<BR>
to 150, we are slowly dwindling. But we are content and happy. And
<BR>
definitely not bored: superhumans have a great sense of humor.
