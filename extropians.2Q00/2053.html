Hi!
<BR>
<P>First of all, I'm very busy for the next two weeks and therefore this is
<BR>
sort of a quick reply.

<EM>&gt;&gt; And it's been known since the 60's that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; cells from old animals put in a tissue culture divide less than that of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;younger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; ones from the same species, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Actually there are studies on both sides of that; just recently I saw a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of some study that &quot;conclusively proved&quot; old human cells do not divide less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than cells from young adults (so obviously the issue is still open).  
</EM><BR>
<P>I mantain my previous statement that cells taken from human donors
<BR>
post-partum do no show a correlation between population doublings in vitro
<BR>
and age of donor. For refs check Cristofalo and de Francheschi (I hope to
<BR>
have the bibliography of my website ready in the next couple of weeks, check
<BR>
it out and you will find all relevant articles there). I can also tell you
<BR>
that studies done in our lab -- though not published for only a few samples
<BR>
were taken -- reached the same conclusion.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Fetal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cells *do* outlast adult cells; but that may be a different process.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But telomere lengths differ between organisms.  Mice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have very long telomeres; we don't.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it's nice to point that humans have the shortest telomeres amongst
<BR>
all studied primates in a given study (I'll give the ref later if you want
<BR>
it). Another interesting point is that average telomere lenght might not be
<BR>
involved in aging but, on the other hand, specific telomere lenght in only
<BR>
one or a few chromossomes might affect aging (thus biasing most of our
<BR>
current reasoning).

<EM>&gt;     &gt;There  is no correlation between in vitro doubling potential from cells taken

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you get more in vitro cell divisions from long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lived species than from short lived ones.
</EM><BR>
<P>ANother interesting idea: long-lived species are bigger in size and mass,
<BR>
which means their cells need to endure more divisions during development and
<BR>
even adulthood (actually I believe somewhere I have an article showing a
<BR>
relation between mass of a spoecies and replicative potential of its cells
<BR>
in vitro).

<EM>&gt;&gt; I believe -- can't find the reference -- some Asian scientists cloning mice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; did find a correlation between donor age of the nucleus and the chances of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; creating a viable clone.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That would be a useful bit of information.  What would be *very* interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be to compare clones produced from normally dividing cells, such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as intestinal cells as I believe was the case with Dolly, cells with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;replicative potential (liver), and non-dividing cells (neurons, muscle, ???).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The question is whether the non-dividing cell can be dedifferentated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;back to a dividing state.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I may be wrong but I believe scientists have accomplished in creating
<BR>
dividing stem cells from post-mitotic tissues such as neurons (must search
<BR>
reference).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you could do that, then you could use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cells from young, middle-aged &amp; old animals and really get a handle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the degree to which mutation accumulation damages genome integrity.
</EM><BR>
<P>That would be a very useful experiment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Joao, you may know the answer to this.  Wasn't there a report
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(perhaps from Univ. of Hawaii?) that telomerase knockout mice *do*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;show signs of inability to develop and/or accelerated aging after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;3-4 generations?  
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe you answered your own question in a posterior post.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If that is true, it might suggest that normal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;telomere lengths in adults would be sufficient to develop 2nd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;generation and perhaps even 3rd generation organs from stem cells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;remaining in the adult body, *without* the necessity of lengthening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the telomeres through cloning or other processes.  Presumably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more terminally differentiated cells (that have gone through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more cell divisions) would be a poorer source material due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to shorter telomeres, *if* you could regress them to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stem cell state.  Now, given the shorter telomeres in humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it would be unclear whether the stem cells in adult humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could be used to grow replacement organs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What we need is the # of cell generations required to produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a 3-5 kg organ from a single cell, the normal adult human telomere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;length and how much each cell division subtracts from the telomeres.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't have time but I think that can be calculated easily for in vitro
<BR>
cells. As for in vivo, you would find a harder time defining the amount of
<BR>
telomeres lost per generation for it depends on tissues but eventually would
<BR>
get and aproximate value. 
<BR>
<P>Best regards and I apologize if I wrote any imperfection.
