<P>What alternate universe are we talking about here? I know it can't be the
<BR>
real world, because I currently have on my hard drive a complete set of
<BR>
Microsoft  documentation for pretty much the entire Windows API set. They
<BR>
don't quite give this away, but they come pretty close - it's only a couple
<BR>
hundred dollars a year for a complete subscription.
<BR>
<P>Obviously they don't completely document every possible bug, side effect or
<BR>
unsupported call in existence, but that isn't because there is some
<BR>
conspiracy to keep it secret. Rather, it is because they only have so much
<BR>
money to spend on developer outreach. The information they do make available
<BR>
is far more complete that the docs I used to work with for Unix and Mac
<BR>
APIs, and about as good as I would ever expect to see for a product that
<BR>
changes substantially every few years.
