Greg writes, quoting Robin:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  People seem to talk all the time about how they &quot;discovered&quot; things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  about what they liked at certain crucial ages, whereas it seems much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  more likely to me that they just changed.  Thing of how differently sex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  is to you at age 18 versus age 10.  This isn't because you learned new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  insights at age 15, it is because hormones were expressed that literally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  made you a different person.  Well changes in hormones don't stop at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  age 18, they continue all the way through life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sure there's a large element of truth in what you've written, Robin.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Until we gain a greater measure of control over our wetware, success and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happiness in life will largely be measured by how well we master and use the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tools dealt us by our current over-all state of being, which will be at least 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to some extent beyond our control.  Thus, when I was young and had what seem 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to me now to be amazingly quick reflexes, I enjoyed driving a motorcycle at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speeds that would surely be suicidal for me now.  Mastery over the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seasonal-scale progression of biological systems in my garden, on the other 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hand, would have been quite beyond my competence in those faster days.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wonder if it would be wise to make an effort to preserve our former
<BR>
personalities, rather than just allowing ourselves to change naturally.
<BR>
<P>One of the philosophical objections sometimes raised here against
<BR>
immortality is that you would change so much over a long lifespan as to
<BR>
have little relation to the being you were originally.  In that case,
<BR>
the original person is really gone, just as surely as if he had died.
<BR>
All that is left is someone who was influenced, perhaps only marginally,
<BR>
by the person who began the process.
<BR>
<P>A way to address this would be to make a commitment to honor the beliefs
<BR>
and desires of your older selves, to think of yourself as not just the
<BR>
person you are today, but also as a representative of the hopes and
<BR>
plans of the people you were in the past.
<BR>
<P>This wouldn't mean that you could never change, only that as you
<BR>
do change, you would remember the person you used to be.  Even as
<BR>
your tastes, desires and beliefs change, you would continue to at
<BR>
least occasionally do things the way your old self would have wanted.
<BR>
You would cultivate a sense of connectedness to your past and future,
<BR>
put down roots into your own timeline.
<BR>
<P>This could give you a more optimistic perspective as you move into
<BR>
a future which offers many opportunities for drastic transformation.
<BR>
You can have confidence that your future self will not forget who you are
<BR>
today, that even as you change you will preserve an element of stability.
