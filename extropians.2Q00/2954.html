<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What if we ask how we can create dynamic DNA rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than allowing ourselves to fall down the slippery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slope of ethical considerations attached with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prescribing physical conditions to our progeny? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, that would be ideal. But it is also rather tricky. The dream
<BR>
would be something like a system where a certain plasmid with a patch
<BR>
for the genome is introduced into the body, inserted into the right
<BR>
place in the genome and replicated between the cells until all have
<BR>
been changed. Doesn't sound entirely impossible, but darn hard to
<BR>
implement well - likely a basic &quot;operating system&quot; for the plasmids
<BR>
would have to be introduced using germline engineering so that cells
<BR>
accept the plasmids when they encounter them, and to keep them
<BR>
person-dependent (you don't what your latest body upgrade to infect
<BR>
others, after all).  This still doesn't do any major morphological
<BR>
changes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Without making any appeal to a non-corporeal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information existence, I can envision a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; semi-autonomous process (governed by a deep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understanding of genetics) whereby not only are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; negative factors (e.g. potential disability and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disease) precluded within the genetic programming, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only the best (read, &quot;really good&quot;) solutions are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found.  All of this however without any hardwiring on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the human designers part.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Many factors have unclear value, both because it is not obvious if
<BR>
they are negative or positive (bloodtype A or B?), they can have
<BR>
different effects under different environmental circumstances (like
<BR>
various heart-disease linked genes), some have both good and bad
<BR>
effects (blood clots when you are young but no heart problems when
<BR>
old) and the value of some are highly subjective (blue eyes?). If you
<BR>
can set a value function and simulate the results of changes in the
<BR>
genome well, then you can do a GA search for an &quot;optimum&quot;, but it
<BR>
seems to be a highly underconstrained problem in a very
<BR>
high-dimensional search space (~100,000 or more dimensions) where the
<BR>
fitness evaluation step will be computationally very heavy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The field currently known as genetic programming uses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a highly dynamic matrix of factors which allow it to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seek out a near-global optimum in a search space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; within highly constrained parameters.  The idea behind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it (Holland, 1975) was originally derived from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; biology.  Now that it's been abstracted and perfected,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; let's use it in biology again. 
</EM><BR>
<P>GAs are definitely not abstracted or perfected. In fact, Holland's
<BR>
schema theory has been widely criticed for being too simplistic, and
<BR>
there is currently no other all-encompassing theory for GAs (lots of
<BR>
research, though). In applications, GAs are just one of many
<BR>
optimiziation methods - that they are inspired by biology doesn't make
<BR>
them better (a claim often heard about neural networks too). They have
<BR>
their uses, but work best on certain kinds of fitness
<BR>
landscapes. Hopefully metaevolution has led to the human genome
<BR>
becoming suitable/the mammalian fitness landscape becoming searchable
<BR>
using GAs, but there is no proof of this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This time to produce the next generation of people.  You can design
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better people without definite specifications of what they must be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and without falling into the dangerous &quot;eugenics&quot; zone...
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm, exactly how does this not fall into eugenics? If you do it on
<BR>
adults (euthenics) then it is clearly not eugenics, but otherwise it
<BR>
is just a version where humans do not make detailled decisions about
<BR>
the genome.
<BR>
<P>I think an overall optimization procedure is possible to deal with
<BR>
obviously negative genes and the unpleasant effects of certain gene
<BR>
combinations (say a novelty seeking dopamine receptor gene and genes
<BR>
leading to lower levels of self control and addiction resistance), but
<BR>
there will still be a huge amount of variability.
<BR>
