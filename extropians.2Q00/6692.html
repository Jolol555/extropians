Robin Hanson summarized some of his current writing:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ordinary intuitions about &quot;fairness&quot; may be less than commonly assumed about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  equal outcomes, and more about how well success correlates with genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  fitness.  It can thus seem fair that the most attractive witty athletic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  folks to get more mates and money, but seem unfair that the rich can buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  better education for their children.  Makeup can seem fair, while breast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  implants seem unfair.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From what I have of late heard about moral and political philosophy, the 
</EM><BR>
reigning school of thought, led by Ronald Dworkin, posits exactly the 
<BR>
converse.  That is, Dworkin claims that benefits we accrue by dint of chance 
<BR>
or of &quot;immutable characteristics&quot; (he apparently assumes genetic attributes 
<BR>
can not be re-engineered) are exactly those that ought rightly be subject to 
<BR>
redistribution.  Those benefits that we accrue by dint of choice we can 
<BR>
rightly retain.
<BR>
<P>I happen to think Dworkin's distinction untenable, but nonetheless it seems 
<BR>
to have a great deal of appeal to professional philosophers.  Query whether 
<BR>
it jibes with lay persons' moral intuitions.  To judge what common folks say 
<BR>
about trust-fund kids, I suspect that Dworkin may have done a good job 
<BR>
of--please pardon my editorial usage--rationalizing envy.
