<P><EM>&gt; Read a bit of your old post there Ken. What about making it more like a buoy or an oil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; derrick. have your sky hook be tall and narrow, and constructed of lots of nanotubes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that act similarly to the cappillary channels in tree trunks. At the bottom are your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bilge vesicles that pump out infallen gasses that have migrated down from the top...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>When I was thinking about the &quot;Ships of the Sky&quot; concept, I was thinking of pre-nanotech,
<BR>
and I wanted something that was mostly above the layers where wind force added to material
<BR>
strength needs.  You are correct that it could be tethered by some &quot;cord&quot; that had He
<BR>
chambers along its length, through which material was delivered by elevator, and bilge
<BR>
pumped out.
<BR>
<P>When you have nanotubes you can grow to order, there is almost no limit to what you can
<BR>
do.  You will be able to generate your own designer aerogel like materials that are
<BR>
permanently buoyant at low altitudes (upsidaisium).  As you suggest by analogy to the oil
<BR>
derricks, very large buildings will be possible that go to high altitudes maintaining
<BR>
neutral buoyancy as they go up.
<BR>
<P>The problem with the current pre-nanotech period of time is that technical efforts (even
<BR>
if successful) yield results that are wiped out by the next advance so soon, that for much
<BR>
of what you could do, you are best off just enjoying the idea, unless it is a step to get
<BR>
to nanotech.  If I wanted to build a ridged air ship now, I would start with silicon
<BR>
wafers and grow about 2 microns of CVD diamond on them.  Then I would pattern and etch
<BR>
most of the wafer away leaving a fractal beam mesh that supports the diamond and
<BR>
terminates at a hexagonal frame.  With enough of these, (and a few pentagons) I can oxide
<BR>
bond them into a close approximation of a sphere.  Part of the wafer design also includes
<BR>
photovoltaic devices so that the sphere provides electric power to a small attached robot
<BR>
and vacuum pump.  To go up, the robot pumps out enough air to displace the weight of the
<BR>
craft (but not enough to crush it), and to go down, it lets air in.  As it gets higher,
<BR>
pressure decreases, so it can pump out more air without getting crushed.  At some point,
<BR>
it has pumped out all the air it can, and that is as far as it can go, but it could stay
<BR>
there as long as it was not damaged (possible com relay station).
<BR>
<P>Cool, but I would rather spend my time developing nano.
