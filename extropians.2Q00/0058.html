<EM>&gt; Let me interject this one comment.  I had read Bill Joy's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; article in Wired, and came with many misconceptions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Had he published his exact pitch at the nerdfest instead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of what was actually published, he mighta convinced more.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd be interested in hearing more about what he said.  Ken Clements in
<BR>
another thread said he described &quot;a 21st century of man made pestilence&quot;.
<BR>
To me this sounds like he was mostly raising the fears of artificial
<BR>
plagues.
<BR>
<P>One of the many things that annoyed me about his article was his coining
<BR>
of the acronym GNR to represent the threats facing us in the future;
<BR>
genetic engineering, nanotech and robotics.  These are said to replace
<BR>
the worries of the past, NBC: nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
<BR>
I see that our knowledge-free poster has adopted Joy's acronym and
<BR>
perhaps it will now come into widespread use like Brin's &quot;transparency&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The thing is, it's misleading because really only the G of GNR is a
<BR>
fear which modern audiences can relate to.  Nanotech is still far off
<BR>
in the future and I can't imaging Joy getting people riled up with yet
<BR>
another talk about gray goo.  The robotics takeover also seems awfully
<BR>
hypothetical and even somewhat dated; Galbraith was writing in the 60s
<BR>
about how automation was going to put people out of work.  It's mostly
<BR>
just a response to people like Moravec with their singularity raptures.
<BR>
Furthermore the R &quot;threat&quot; is much more complex and nuanced, raising
<BR>
the question of whether we can become or merge with robots, or whether
<BR>
robots should be better considered as enemies or our children.  All this
<BR>
is lost in Joy's fearmongering.
<BR>
<P>The bottom line is that only the fear of genetically engineered plagues
<BR>
is rhetorically effective today.  And the irony is, the G of GNR is just
<BR>
an updated version of the B of NBC!  Genetic engineering is the modern
<BR>
way of creating biological weapons.
<BR>
<P>We've lived with biological research, including genetic engineering,
<BR>
for decades.  Of course genetics is in the news today and everyone is
<BR>
fearful, so we shouldn't be surprised when Joy exploits these fears
<BR>
for his rhetorical purposes.  But realistically, this threat is not
<BR>
entirely new.  With the right knowledge, genetics has never required an
<BR>
expensive research lab.  And of course there are any number of potent and
<BR>
dangerous organisms like anthrax which terrorists could have access to.
<BR>
<P>I find it quite annoying that Joy is able to hitch his cart of fears about
<BR>
all these future technologies to modern day worries over frankenfoods,
<BR>
especially if he is going to downplay the threat of NBC weapons as an
<BR>
issue of the past.  Weapons of mass destruction are arguably much more
<BR>
severe and dangerous, even today, given the uncertain state of the world.
