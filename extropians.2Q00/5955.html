<EM>&gt;  &gt; Aargh!  Just as we're being accused of anti-Semitism, Mike goes and

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Since half my family is jewish, accusing me of anti-semitism is pretty stupid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;LISTEN VERY CLOSELY: I am most pointedly NOT blaming &quot;THE JEWS&quot; for anything.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There are liberals of all ethnic types, including many hypersensitive jewish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people,
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, you're not blaming all Jews, just &quot;leftist/socialist Jews.&quot; 
<BR>
Thanks for clearing that up.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I should have used a smiley in my original note.  I didn't 
<BR>
really think you were being anti-semitic.  Even though you clarified 
<BR>
which Jews you were referencing, the idea of attributing any problems 
<BR>
to any Jews while were are being accused of anti-semitism seemed 
<BR>
unwise.  That was the point that I was trying to make.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I suppose I could use your strategy against you and say that since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you are purposely trying to alienate a reasonable view, then you are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trying, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fact, to practice the strategy that I illustrated above, and are trying to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;divisive and alienating, so therefore you must be an extremist, while my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;position is one of reasonableness..... Now, how does that feel?
</EM><BR>
<P>Same as always, I guess.  :-)
