The reason I'm writing this letter is not to ask for funding for the 
<BR>
Singularity Institute. I'm not even writing in the hope that someone will 
<BR>
create the first Institute of Verification, or incorporate &quot;Genesis Idea 
<BR>
Broker, Inc.&quot;.

<P>As Silicon Valley billionaires turn to philanthropy, I hope to see a 
<BR>
tradition of originality, of going beyond the mundane. I hope to see more 
<BR>
Internet millionaires living up to the standard for creativity set by 
<BR>
Michael Saylor's free online university, or the standard for leverage and 
<BR>
global impact set by Steven and Michele Kirsch. I hope to see it become a 
<BR>
rule in Silicon Valley philanthropy: For every $100M spent on mundane 
<BR>
philanthropy, spend $10M on thinking outside the box.  I hope to see charity 
<BR>
for technophiles... technophilanthropy

<P>Wow, I was very impressed by your ideas.  It must be incredibly frustrating 
<BR>
to have such great concepts but not the capital or the connections to see 
<BR>
them made real.  And when they do eventually come about you will not be 
<BR>
getting a slice of the profit pie.  But at least the world would be a better 
<BR>
place.
<BR>
<P>To try to get through the 'screens' that surround the very wealthy can be an 
<BR>
extremely difficult task.  But have you even tried, Eliezer?  Perhaps you 
<BR>
should write grant proposals to charity foundations like the one created by 
<BR>
Bill Gates and his wife.  But I realize they are into looking at 'resumes' 
<BR>
to see if one is deserving as you pointed out.  But nothing ventured, 
<BR>
nothing gained.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
