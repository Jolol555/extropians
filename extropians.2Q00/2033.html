<EM>&gt; &gt; Sorry, but his reality is a lot closer than yours.  As a former Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; employee involved in O/S work (NT 3.1 in my case), I agree that there was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; never any specific intent to hide APIs from application developers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Indeed, Microsoft donated office space in its own building for various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; application developers to work with APIs under development.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You really worked on NT 3.1? I would love to hear more about it, as might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others on this list.
</EM><BR>
<P>Myself for one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyone who is bored by such discussion, just remember that your future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wearables/surgical implants may very well run an MS or MS derived OS,
</EM><BR>
<P>At the moment, I do find this quite unlikely. I'm active on some of
<BR>
the wearable lists, and have my own construction in progress (minus the
<BR>
display, for now).
<BR>
<P>The vast majority of efforts in progress are using Linux or other
<BR>
unices, since MS systems don't posess the flexibility to move
<BR>
to that environment. Which is not to say, of course, that MS could not
<BR>
produce software for wearables - but I imagine by the time they take
<BR>
any steps in that direction other 
<BR>
<P>But there are also ideas about doing something completely new - the
<BR>
current thread on wear-hard is a discussion of the possibilities of
<BR>
using custom code on Z80 derivatives... maybe some old skills coming
<BR>
back to life here :)
