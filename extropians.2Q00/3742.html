<P>Speaking of which, as I was looking through the BBC

News website earlier today, I came across Prince

Charles's latest diatribe-- here it is for anyone else

who hasn't seen this yet.

<BR>
with the government
<BR>
<P>Prince Charles, a long-standing opponent of
<BR>
genetically-modified food, is to warn the scientific
<BR>
community that tampering with nature could cause great
<BR>
harm to the world. 
<BR>
<P>The Prince of Wales is to voice his concerns during a
<BR>
contribution to the Reith Lectures, broadcast on BBC
<BR>
Radio 4 on Wednesday. 
<BR>
He speaks of the need to &quot;work with nature&quot; and will
<BR>
warn of the dire consequences of ignoring the
<BR>
&quot;essential unity&quot; of the living and spiritual worlds. 
<BR>
<P>The 2,300-word essay was written by the prince during
<BR>
a recent pilgrimage to a remote Greek monastery. 
<BR>
<P>He says his concerns are rooted in the need to
<BR>
safeguard the divinely-created Earth. But the prince's
<BR>
swipes at biotechnology may prompt a further rift
<BR>
between St James's Palace and the government, which
<BR>
continues to support GM technology. 
<BR>
<P>'Nothing held sacred' 
<BR>
<P>The prince will argue it is because of humanity's
<BR>
&quot;inability or refusal to accept the existence of a
<BR>
guiding hand that nature has come to be regarded as a
<BR>
system that can be engineered for our own
<BR>
convenience&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>[picture of a female scientist at work]
<BR>
[caption:] Tampering with God's work?
<BR>
<P>He will go on to say: &quot;We need to rediscover a
<BR>
reverence for the natural world, irrespective of its
<BR>
usefulness to ourselves, to become more aware of the
<BR>
relationship between God, man and creation. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;If literally nothing is held sacred any more -
<BR>
because it is considered synonymous with superstition
<BR>
or in some other way 'irrational' - what is there to
<BR>
prevent us treating our entire world as some great
<BR>
laboratory of life with potentially disastrous
<BR>
long-term consequences?&quot; 
<BR>
<P>He welcomes a &quot;precautionary approach&quot; to scientific
<BR>
advances and mocks those who portray this as a sign of
<BR>
weakness or an attempt to halt progress. 
<BR>
<P>Mankind 'part of nature' 
<BR>
<P>&quot;I believe it to be a sign of strength and wisdom,&quot; he
<BR>
says in the lecture, which was recorded three weeks
<BR>
ago at his home, Highgrove House in Gloucestershire. 
<BR>
<P>He counsels against reducing the natural world to a
<BR>
mechanical process. 
<BR>
<P>[picture of the Earth from space]
<BR>
[caption:] Prince believes in divinely-created Earth
<BR>
<P>&quot;In this technology-driven age, it is all too easy for
<BR>
us to forget that mankind is part of nature and not
<BR>
apart from it, and that this is why we should seek to
<BR>
work with the grain of nature in everything we do,&quot; he
<BR>
says. 
<BR>
<P>Science, he says, should be used to understand how
<BR>
nature works but not to change what it is. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Only by rediscovering the essential unity and order
<BR>
of the living and spiritual world will we avoid the
<BR>
disintegration of our overall environment,&quot; he
<BR>
concludes. 
<BR>
<P>The prince's lecture will be discussed on the
<BR>
programme by the five Reith lecturers, former Hong
<BR>
Kong governor Chris Patten, former Norwegian prime
<BR>
minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, BP Amoco chief
<BR>
executive Sir John Browne, Indian ecologist Vandana
<BR>
Shiva and Tom Lovejoy, chief bio-diversity adviser to
<BR>
the World Bank.
