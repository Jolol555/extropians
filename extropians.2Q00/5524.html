Hi!
<BR>
<P>You wrote:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Seasonal riots? Really? Never heard of them. Do you mean riots in the big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like LA once a decade???
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Note that the social and legal systems in cities like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;LA are as opressive as any european country (and far more racist).
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't know we lived in a oppressive society? A question: since Europeans
<BR>
live in an oppressive society and legal system, how come we never riot as
<BR>
it happens in LA? No racism?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Cities that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't have such oppressive laws have very european level violent crime rates,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;while few places in the US have property crime rates at even a small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fraction of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the huge amount over there in europe. Moreover, non-gun violent crime in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;europe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pretty closely matches that seen in most of the urban US, while suburban and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rural violence is far lower.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe it was you who said that there is one gun for each American;
<BR>
assuming that premise, measuring non-gun violent crimes in the US is
<BR>
insignificant.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;New York fans are considered the rudest and most offensive fans in the US (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recall all the Mariners/Yankees playoffs games I went to a 5 years ago, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;New York fans were throwing garbage on the outfield..The Seattle fans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wanted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;go out and sort it for recycling...;) ), so if you were amazed at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;goings on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at a New York game, then you would be stunned at a major league game in most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other cities.
</EM><BR>
<P>I forgot to mention what is probably the major cause for non-violence in US
<BR>
sports: geography. How many Pacers fans are going to LA to see the NBA
<BR>
Finals tonight? 10, 20? It depends on including the players and their
<BR>
relatives or not. Well, in European sports when, say, the major Portuguese
<BR>
clubs face each other, they can well have as high as 50'000 fans each in
<BR>
the same place; and there's when the problems begin. US sports fans are
<BR>
never really in contact with one another, are they? Perhaps except the
<BR>
Superbowl but that's an annual event where only the richest people go, so
<BR>
it doesn't really count. Actually, and since one of you mentioned Houston,
<BR>
I remember some problems when the Rockets won the NBA a few years ago; or
<BR>
was it when the Broncos won the NFL? I also remember that the Jazz fans
<BR>
insulted with obsceneties the Bulls' players in the NBA Finals. So we are
<BR>
not that different, you just miss the fans confrontations because they
<BR>
never meet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As to the rest of your post, Mike, I'll reiterate what I've said before about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the level of violence in the US: Most non-US folks have a wildly inflated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idea of the level of violence here, based on our movies and the filter of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;own &quot;news&quot; media, re-amplified by the local media in their own country who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;further blow the violence here out of proportion.  I've had many fairly comic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;moments as a regular host of non-Americans on their first trips to the US,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;watching as they look for the burning buildings from the &quot;annual riots&quot;, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;running gun battles in the streets and the uninterrupted cross-country high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;speed car chases . . . they seem a little disappointed, I think, when it all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;turns out to be a glamorous exaggeration.
</EM><BR>
<P>I actually saw the Miami police performing an arrest on my first trip to
<BR>
the US; I've never watched an arrest in Portugal in my life. But my
<BR>
personal experience is not important. The fact remains that Washington has
<BR>
the second highest murder rates of all cities worldwide not in a state of
<BR>
war (second to Rio de Janeiro). Of course that the US is not Beirut. But
<BR>
for me, a Portuguese used to a society with a very low level of violent
<BR>
crimes, the idea that you can get into an argument with a driver or
<BR>
whatever and he pulls off a gun is a scary one; something that is very
<BR>
unlikely, to say the least, to happen in Portugal.
<BR>
<P>Best regards.
