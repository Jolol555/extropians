<EM>&gt; &gt; Well from James' more recent post it seems that I had *him* wrong when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suggested that he was espousing summary execution for cops who did bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shootings.  He seems to understand the overarching impracticality of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; extreme measure.  You, however, seem to think it would be a good thing.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I pose the question now to you - where in the world do you think you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; find people to take the job of a cop if a mistake in judgment would lead 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their summary execution?  How much do you think such brave souls would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to be paid to take the job?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There are many millions of law abiding citizens who carry concealed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;weapons every day (myself included), who live under the same standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;every day. If I kill someone I beleive is committing a crime with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deadly weapon, why should I be held to a higher standard of behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than a cop who does the same thing? Since the cop is supposedly more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trained than I, he should be the one living up to the higher standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than I (why should he have more authority if he isn't more trained?). If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I make a mistake, and kill someone, I can be held responsible, just as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you describe. I accept that risk, because I know that there is a greater
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;risk if I DONT carry that gun that someone WILL get hurt by my inability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to either defend myself or someone else. And, I don't get paid a dime to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;take that risk.. Howz them apples?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah I suppose there are some people who get their thrills by packing heat 
<BR>
and the anticipated rush of actually getting to use it on somebody.  But 
<BR>
still being a citizen packing heat while going about your office cubicle 
<BR>
routine of a life is a far cry from having a job description which requires 
<BR>
you to go into the most dangerous areas of your city everyday looking for 
<BR>
the most dangerous people in those dangerous areas and convincing them to 
<BR>
accompany you downtown to begin the process of possibly being incarcerated 
<BR>
for a substantial fraction of their lives.
