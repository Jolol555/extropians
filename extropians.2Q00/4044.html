<EM>&gt; This is a myth. According to him anyway (&quot;my years with ayn rand&quot;), the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; similarity is a coincidence.
</EM><BR>
<P>I stand corrected!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;As for her views on sexuality in general, I find them more a projection
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;her peculiar personality than as firmly grounded in Objectivism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is one aspect of her main flaw - that to her, EVERYTHING had to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; derived from objectivity. There was no room for subjective sexual tastes,
</EM><BR>
or
<BR>
<EM>&gt; even objective tastes. As a result, she insisted that her own subjective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sexual and artistic tastes were objective, and anyone who didn't share
</EM><BR>
them
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is just wrong. I'm surprised that she left out tastes in food. Maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someday, &quot;The Ayn Rand cookbook&quot; will be compiled, with an introduction by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Leonard Peikoff, where she talks about how only second-handers and haters
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; man like Italian food.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not completely true, but mostly true.  The problem then is to separate where
<BR>
her views actually have a valid grounding and where they don't -- else one
<BR>
winds up disregarding everything she said or wrote.
<BR>
<P>In the case of art, also, it's a little more complex than Rand merely taking
<BR>
her particular likes and dislikes as objective.  Anyone who has read closely
<BR>
her &quot;Art and Sense of Life&quot; (pp34-44 of _The Romantic Manifesto_) should see
<BR>
this.  There, as I've stated here on this list several times in the last day
<BR>
or so, she discriminates between personal responses to art and objective
<BR>
evaluations of it.  She uses many examples and does not expect everyone to
<BR>
have the same reaction to art, even if every rational individual might have
<BR>
the same evaluation -- given the same level of knowledge and intelligence --
<BR>
of it.
<BR>
<P>For example, on page 43 she states: &quot;I cannot stand Tolstoy, and reading him
<BR>
was the most boring literary duty I ever had to perfrom... and yet, from a
<BR>
purely literary viewpoint, on his own terms, I have to evaluate him as a
<BR>
good writer.&quot;  This seems to me to be a direct refutation of the notion that
<BR>
she always identifies her tastes with objective evaluations in art.
<BR>
<P>Also, I should state too since this all seems to circle around Modern Art
<BR>
that Rand believed it wasn't art at all.  She defines art in a certain
<BR>
specific way -- &quot;a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's
<BR>
metaphysical value-judgments.&quot; (p19) -- and believes Modern Art does not
<BR>
fall under this definition.  Rand did not argue, &quot;I don't Modern Art, ergo
<BR>
it is not art.&quot;  She gives many examples of other art which she does not
<BR>
like even feels revulsion for yet which she still thinks is art, such as
<BR>
Naturalist fiction, Medieval sculpture, and the music of Beethoven.  If she
<BR>
were purely moving from her own tastes, then I think she would be more
<BR>
disposed to reclassifying all of these as non-art.
<BR>
<P>Later!
