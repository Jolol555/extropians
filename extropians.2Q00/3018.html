From: Eliezer S. Yudkowsky (<A HREF="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20SSRIs%20and%20sudden%20grief&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110704b5440951ae58@[149.217.0.152]&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</A>) Fri, 12 May 2000:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If that doesn't work, you could try happiness. Many people report that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;happiness is surprisingly effective in combating despair; similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;results have been reported for joy.
</EM><BR>
<P>A joke? (yes, OK, it made me smile)
<BR>
<P>Seriously, though, Eliezer, when a person is in utter despair, their
<BR>
reality is so completely distorted, that one can't remotely imagine
<BR>
that happiness will ever again be possible.
<BR>
<P>One thing that you didn't mention in your message was the value
<BR>
of vigorous exercise to combat despair. Many people here probably
<BR>
are aware of this, but I will mention it anyway.
<BR>
<P>The exercise must be regular, intense, and have a minimum duration to have
<BR>
a significant impact on anxiety, however. One needs to make an
<BR>
agreement with oneself to stick with it.
<BR>
<P>There's a book I like very much that takes a very pro-active and
<BR>
realistic approach to dealing with panic, anxiety, and despair. Even
<BR>
if a person doesn't experience these difficulties to a large degree,
<BR>
and they only become depressed every once in a while, the book
<BR>
has very good suggestions and coping strategies:
<BR>
<P>_The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook_ by Edmund Bourne
<BR>
<P>As I said in an earlier message, an SSRI didn't have an effect
<BR>
on me for my time of extreme despair, even though I gave a good try
<BR>
for 3 months. I could have tried harder going that route, but
<BR>
I already had too many unknowns in my life, was pretty badly
<BR>
frightened and felt very alone, and I didn't want any more unknowns.
<BR>
<P>Instead I got out my mountain bike and I rode. And rode and rode.
<BR>
Maybe I was feeling helpless, and just trying to escape, but the action,
<BR>
instead, kept me within myself. It didn't matter to where I rode,
<BR>
but there are 12% grade hills to climb all around that I couldn't
<BR>
avoid, therefore the bike riding was strenuous.
<BR>
<P>Not only did it have an effect on the brain chemistry to calm
<BR>
me down and subdue my anxiety, it also gave me the time I needed
<BR>
to grieve.
<BR>
<P>(I still ride, BTW)
<BR>
<P>The worst thing that one can do when facing a loss is try to
<BR>
ignore it, or pretend that it doesn't exist. The Zen folks have
<BR>
an approach that I like very much for handling grief, that is:
<BR>
&quot;to have a tea with your emotions&quot;. One notices the grief.
<BR>
Where the grief feels in the chest. How it moves around or changes
<BR>
in intensity. Simply, one sits with it, and acknowledges its
<BR>
existence (&quot;Having a tea&quot;), for as long as you need. In
<BR>
the process, you learn acceptance, you learn that you are
<BR>
not dead by the catastrophic event. Time helps to heal and do
<BR>
the rest.
<BR>
<P>I have one other suggestion for coping with extreme despair.
<BR>
Something that that we can do, to give to ourselves some
<BR>
self-insurance for those despair times, is to write, when we are
<BR>
in a non-despairing mode, a list of those people whom we consider
<BR>
friends (distant or close), those people who we know truly care
<BR>
about us.
<BR>
<P>Then when, or if, we are hit with a time of falling into the abyss,
<BR>
and our reality perceptions become completely skewed and distorted,
<BR>
we can get out that list and from it, call someone.  To have that
<BR>
necessary reality check to save our lives.
<BR>
