<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; No, no, no...this won't do at all.  While it is true that a claymore will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; frag any thief out to 100 meters or so in the operating direction (&quot;This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; side facing enemy&quot;), it also has a tendency to obliterate everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; within about 15 meters in every direction.  This can't possibly be a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; thing for your car.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But a price of a car is little price to pay for permanently removing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that particular agent from possible interactions in your personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; future.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How about multiple-use? Active armor, for instance?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Trouble is, carjackers have a bad habit of capping slow-reacting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; victims, or of taking female victims along for rape &amp; murder.  Stopping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them at the door is a Good Thing.  The first torch unit used in the US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would land the user in jail, alas.  Maybe if it followed the flames with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a halon spray to put the perp out before letting him get totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toasted... but the prosecutors would probably still label it first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; degree arson.
</EM><BR>
<P>AFAIK, the flames put out are not of high enough temperature or duration to
<BR>
seriously burn someone unless they are dumb enough to stick around for repeated
<BR>
shots. It seemed that when I heard about it, it would singe your hair, but thats
<BR>
about it unless you got repeated shots. This flame thrower unit would be useful
<BR>
and legal in Virginia, though, where they are rather lenient toward people
<BR>
defending themselves against carjackkers.
<BR>
<P>I personally like the idea of a taser triggered by an alarm, that discharges
<BR>
through the body of the car.
<BR>
<P>&quot;PLEASE STEP AWAY FROM THE CAR...&quot;
<BR>
....
<BR>
&quot;OH, YOU WANT SOME HUH? HOW ABOUT THIS!&quot;ZZZZAAAPPPPP
<BR>
&quot;AND HOW ABOUT SOME OF THIS?&quot; ZZZAAAPPPP
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BTW, in my cab driving days I once had a belligerent passenger (standing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behind the open left rear door) grab my left wrist as I reached back for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cash awkwardly offered from behind.  He started to lift a weapon in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his right hand (I never did see exactly what it was), so I threw the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gearshift in reverse and ran him over with the door.  If I'd thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just a bit faster I'd have cocked the wheel to my right to swing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; front of the car over him, too.  Asshole.
</EM><BR>
<P>Driving over him once you could dismiss as an accident. If you changed gears and
<BR>
went over him a second time, you might have some problems...
