<P>Ok, John. I'll make this very very simple for you.
<BR>
<P>Take company A. They make flimdoodles, which are the primary product in a society, and many subsidiary
<BR>
industries make parts for flimdoodles, distributing flimdoodles, selling flimdoodles, maintaining and
<BR>
servicing flimdoodles, etc. and all the people employed by those industries have consumer industries that
<BR>
depend on the spending of all the employees in the flimdoodle industry. The flimdoodle industry employes
<BR>
1 million people, and produces 1 million flimdoodles every year. The typical usable lifetime of a
<BR>
flimdoodle is 10 years, and in Country A, there are ten million users of flimdoodles, or about one
<BR>
flimdoodle per family. Everybody is happy, there is an economic equilibrium of demand and supply.
<BR>
<P>Scenario 1:
<BR>
Now Company B comes along with the Super-flimdoodle, or SFD for short. The SFD lasts for 20 years, it can
<BR>
travel twice as far and twice as fast as regular flimdoodles, and it costs half as much, needs to be
<BR>
maintained half as much, and uses half as much energy. Company B has fully automated the entire
<BR>
manufacturing process and employes only 10% of the number of people as Company A to produce 1 million
<BR>
SFD's per year. Naturally, everybody buys SFDs instead of flimdoodles. Company B may hire away 10% of
<BR>
Company A's workforce, but once they are fully staffed, Company A is out of business, and 900,000 people
<BR>
are unemployed. Unemployment goes from 0 to 9% in short order just from that one change. Then all of the
<BR>
subsidiary industries and consumer industries that depended on those employed people are not making
<BR>
money, and they have to lay off employees as well. Unemployment goes higher, reducing consumer spending
<BR>
even more. People can't afford to buy even SFDs in the quantities that they once bought flimdoodles, so
<BR>
Company B's sales drop, they have to cut prices in order to sell what they are already producing..
<BR>
<P>Scenario 2:
<BR>
Company A's old flimdoodles actually only last only 1 year, but their new flimdoodle technology allows
<BR>
new ones to last ten years. Within a year, Company A's flimdoodle sales drop to just 10% of what they
<BR>
were a year previously. Production gets cut back, and 90% of Company A's workforce is laid off, etc..
