<P><EM>&gt; What strikes me as amazing is just how many times I've run into people or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; associations with Rome, GA, where I mispent most of my youth.  For a town of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about 30,000 (probably more now), Rome and people from there show up more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; often in the news than perhaps any other town of that size.  Have you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noticed this as well?  Any theories?
</EM><BR>
<P>Notta one.  Just noticed that one of the papers at the Journal of
<BR>
Transhumanism is from at professor at Berry College, though.
<BR>
<P>And the president of the American Library Association (one of the largest
<BR>
professional organizations in the country) a few years back grew up in
<BR>
Rome.  I had the *enourmously* amusing priveledge to see him welcomed as a
<BR>
conquering hero by they city library...to be told this was the first time
<BR>
he ever set foot in it becasue he is black, and they weren't allowed in
<BR>
the library back then.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Did anyone clue you into why Rome was famous?  At one point they had the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highest ratio of cars to people in the entire world.  However, the city 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fathers didn't get around to mentioning why.  Turns out that Rome was the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bootleg capital of the SouthEast during prohibition.  When that petered out, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they had all these experts at sooping up cars and rebuilding them with fake 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gas tanks, etc., all looking for something to do....   So they became the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; car theft capital of the world.
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't know that.  I always thought the place was kinda shady ever since
<BR>
I was told it had the largest number of churches per capita of any place
<BR>
in the country.  Coming from New Orleans (with the largest number per
<BR>
capita of bars) was something of a ... shock.
