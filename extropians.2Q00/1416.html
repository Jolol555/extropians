<P><EM>&gt; The posthuman egroup list has been discussing better alternatives to human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pair-bonding monogamy/ monotony, for example.
</EM><BR>
<P>So what else is new? It has been discussed here and elsewhere from
<BR>
time to time too.
<BR>
<P>Sure, but I think the crossmatching/ quorum alternatives are specifically
<BR>
posthuman?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; So the swifter and more positive, radical, option is to declare yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; post- or neohuman at the outset, act as though it were true, and wait
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the changes to happen all by themselves!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh! I'm a jupiter brain. This easter I'm going to act as if I was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ~100 km sphere of diamondoid quantum dot cellular automata, surrounded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by a corona of solar collectors and radiators and with a mental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capacity a few billon times the whole of humanity (it could have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more, but those posthuman screensavers take a *lot* of memory, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they are not running). I can think billions of superhuman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thoughts at once, weaving together strands of ideas without the least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; risk of getting confused. I understand all of human history and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowledge just as easily as a human could understand a simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equation.  Hmm, let's start with terraforming Sweden...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But do you believe the above? It is fairly standard in hypnotherapy to
</EM><BR>
make
<BR>
<EM>&gt; positive assertions and declarations so the the &quot;subconscious&quot; can bring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the desired effects without interference from the critical mind. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happen to belive that post/neohuman is attainable (indeed has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attained!) by me, whereas my skull wouldn't hold a brain the size of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jupiter.
</EM><BR>
<P>(Anders) Sure, it makes a lot of sense to live one's life as if you were
<BR>
already the charismatic intelligent trans/post/ex-human you plan to
<BR>
become.
<BR>
<P>OK, we agree on this now.
<BR>
<P>(Anders) But what I was pointing out is that there is a very real limit
<BR>
to the utility of this when you just try to be radical.
<BR>
<P>Yes, we musn't just be radical as a pose, but must carry thru and
<BR>
instantiate genuine innovations. My posthuman revelations came about as a
<BR>
result of a discovery in philosophy (MVT, solution to the mind-body problem,
<BR>
1980 <A HREF="http://www.multi.co.uk/primal.htm">http://www.multi.co.uk/primal.htm</A>.)    I am radical mainly out of
<BR>
necessity ...
<BR>
<P>(Anders) Making grand gestures or imagining oneself to be superhuman is
<BR>
*fun*, but it better
<BR>
work well together with real life too.
<BR>
<P>If it doesn't work, then modify it ...... I don't think there is any value
<BR>
in 'trying to be' something that basically doesn't suit you or causes you
<BR>
problems. Not sure what you mean by real life .... is this E-list real life,
<BR>
for example? Definately is more fun than pretending to be human all your
<BR>
(one and only ) life-time. I think you could make the case that becoming
<BR>
neohuman is worth a try just on the fun basis alone!
<BR>
<P>In the great work

</EM><BR>
<P>I now declare myself posthuman! Presto-chango! Tah Dahh!  This is great!  I
<BR>
really don't like taking the bus to work so now I can run there today at
<BR>
speeds up to 120 mph and not even get tired!!  I could simply fly but I will
<BR>
start out small.
<BR>
<P>With my 400 IQ (yes, off the charts!) and totally photographic memory I will
<BR>
finally become an honor student!  I have an intellect now on par with the
<BR>
genetically engineered superhumans of the Dan Simmons novel _Brain Child_
<BR>
which will make my life so much easier.  I can now speed-read through a book
<BR>
and totally master the contents in that time!
<BR>
<P>I will octuple major in the following subjects, computer sci, business,
<BR>
biology, history, physics, art, world literature and philosophy.  I am going
<BR>
for a light courseload because I don't want to burden my posthuman self too
<BR>
much and I will need time for an active social life.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I will just forget about college for awhile and start up my own
<BR>
company that sells the brilliant computer software I can now write!  Within
<BR>
a few years or less I will have a net worth in the billions of dollars and
<BR>
can finally be extremely generous to all my favorite causes.
<BR>
<P>My &quot;nano touch&quot; makes me into a being of great power for good.  Like the
<BR>
heroine of the &quot;Bohr Maker&quot; I can heal others and easily create what I need
<BR>
to.  Brent and I can straighten out the world now!
<BR>
<P>I havn't looked in the mirror yet but I know that now I am incredibly
<BR>
handsome!  Between my handsome chiseled features, muscular body and
<BR>
overwhelming pheromones, I am going to have a hard time fending off all the
<BR>
beautiful women!  I will have to decide on just one!  Of course, I will let
<BR>
her in on our little secret too!
<BR>
<P>Anders, I realize I have been nowhere as ambitious as you, but I want to
<BR>
still be relatively human.  I hope you will be willing to consult for less
<BR>
developed posthumans in case we need it!  Wow, the things you learn about on
<BR>
this list....
<BR>
<P>Is Sweden so inhospitable that it needs terraforming?  I thought they had an
<BR>
earthlike climate there? lol!
<BR>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<BR>
Ta John
<BR>
<P>But your point seems exactly the same one Anders raised, which I refute
<BR>
thus:
<BR>
<P>Yes, I am aware of flaws in Nietsche's Superman ideas ..... all I suggest is
<BR>
that we can more easily reach our full potential, whatever it might be, by
<BR>
using positive affirmations and &quot;neohuman&quot; psycho-dynamic rebirth.
<BR>
If you read what I actually say (www.multi.co.uk/identityhtm) instead of
<BR>
assuming that my interpretation of posthuman means &quot;superman&quot; ... I am very
<BR>
clear in pointing out that &quot;after&quot; human is value judgement free, and does
<BR>
not imply any unrealistic or improbable improvements.
