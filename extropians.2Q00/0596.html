<EM>&gt; &gt; Teachers are hardly low paid. The median teacher salary for a job that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only takes 3/4 of the year (and provides over a month of vacation during
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the school year), is above $30,000, for an annualized salary of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; $40,000.00. Not bad at all.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't compete with other industries seeking the same skills.  Schools here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get the worst students or the ones that are anti-money and take the low pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for altruistic reasons.

<P>A big problem that is being seen here in the silly clone valley is that the
<BR>
few workers we manage to pry away from the local hi-tech startups to
<BR>
teach in the public schools often teach values which are grossly
<BR>
inappropriate for the communities in which the students live.
<BR>
<P>For instance, the burger joints around here need to offer the
<BR>
starting burger flippers 8 bucks an hour, which makes the
<BR>
elementary school teacher less than twice minimum wage.
<BR>
No surprise that there is a big debate now whether to spend a
<BR>
month teaching the children what a great guy *Cesar Chavez* was.
<BR>
<P>Now, I have nothing against the organizer of farm workers, but
<BR>
for CRYIN out loud, considering how many *critically important*
<BR>
lessons in math, science and technology these kids will desperately
<BR>
need in order to have a vague hope of ever affording a one bedroom
<BR>
apartment in their own neighborhood, they have no time to be fooling
<BR>
around learning about how people out in the central valley make a
<BR>
living picking grapes.  spike
