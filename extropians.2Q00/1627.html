<P><P>&quot;Engines of Creation 2000&quot; Initiative
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/engines">http://www.foresight.org/engines</A>
<BR>
<P>Budget: $95K-$145K ($40K committed as of April 25, 2000)
<BR>
Watch our progress at: <A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/engines/index.html#fundprogress">http://www.foresight.org/engines/index.html#fundprogress</A>
<BR>
<P><P>Most of us were inspired to join Foresight by the 1986 book Engines 
<BR>
of Creation by
<BR>
Foresight's fearless leader Eric Drexler. It was -- and still is -- a 
<BR>
great book,
<BR>
and is now viewed as having been accurate in its key projections, 
<BR>
such as the coming
<BR>
nanotechnology revolution.
<BR>
<P>But it is now seriously out of date -- e.g. it called for &quot;hypertext 
<BR>
publishing&quot; as
<BR>
an aid to the evolution of knowledge. We have this now: it's called 
<BR>
the web, and it
<BR>
is indeed extremely important, but now we have to fold it -- and the 
<BR>
other positive
<BR>
(and negative) changes that have occurred since 1986 - into our 
<BR>
overall goals and
<BR>
strategies.
<BR>
<P>We ask you to join in supporting &quot;Engines of Creation 2000&quot; with your ideas,
<BR>
energy, and funds. This ambitious project, at the heart of the Foresight
<BR>
enterprise, will aim to influence:
<BR>
<P>*  who gets nanotechnology first -- public or private, secret or open, in which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country?
<BR>
*  intellectual property in nanotechnology -- tightly held or widely available?
<BR>
*  ownership of space resources (i.e. most of the universe) --
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government or private? winner take all, or distributed?
<BR>
*  which entities will have &quot;human rights&quot;?
<BR>
*  openness vs. privacy -- can we find a balance that works?
<BR>
*  encrypted private currencies -- can government panic be headed off?
<BR>
*  open source -- can we spread the model beyond software?
<BR>
*  can nanotech warfare be prevented?
<BR>
<P>Join the ongoing Engines Initiative as we picture our preferred 
<BR>
future, design a
<BR>
pathway there, and implement using all the tools available.  To get started,
<BR>
let's raise the needed funds:
<BR>
<P>PHASE I: May 2000, Budget $30K, now committed $25K
<BR>
We are working to complete funding for this phase by Friday, April 28.
<BR>
<P>Intensive in-person work at the Spring 2000 Gathering to generate and extract
<BR>
participants' contributions to Foresight issues in the original 
<BR>
Engines of Creation
<BR>
and the updated version now being initiated. Budget includes professional
<BR>
facilitation, data capture, and physical environment support provided 
<BR>
by Iterations
<BR>
(headed by Matt and Gail Taylor, co-sponsors of Group Genius 1999).
<BR>
<P>PHASE II: June 2000 start date, Budget $60K, now committed $10K
<BR>
<P>Writing draft of &quot;Engines of Creation 2000&quot; book, also to form core of website.
<BR>
Draft to be done by Chris Peterson, editing and Foreword by Eric 
<BR>
Drexler. Draft is
<BR>
posted chapter-by-chapter while in progress. Funds budgeted go to hiring a new
<BR>
Executive Director to manage Foresight, enabling Chris to write the book.
<BR>
<P>PHASE III: July 2000 start date, Budget $10K-$55K, now committed $10K
<BR>
<P>Group annotation and critiquing of online book draft (and related &quot;Engines of
<BR>
Creation 2000&quot; materials). A standard paper version of the book (title to be
<BR>
determined) is planned for spring 2001 publication. The minimum budget, already
<BR>
committed, includes use of existing open-source Crit software (sponsored by
<BR>
Foresight) and existing open-source Slashdot software as the annotation and
<BR>
critiquing tools. The higher budget includes new software tools as proposed by
<BR>
developer Dave Krieger and Foresight Chairman Eric Drexler, see
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/engines/software.html">http://www.foresight.org/engines/software.html</A> for this additional proposal.
<BR>
<P>PHASE IV: May 2001
<BR>
<P>Process repeats, starting with Spring Gathering 2001 and continuing through
<BR>
&quot;singularity&quot;. Goal is continual extraction and incorporation of a wide variety
<BR>
of high-quality input from within and outside of Foresight.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***********************************************
<BR>
<P>Find this all a little overwhelming? Not for us as a group. While it might feel
<BR>
intimidating to sit alone, watching as this future comes charging at us, we've
<BR>
found that jumping in and trying to tweak things for the better is great fun.
<BR>
<P>I hope you will join with us in continuing the &quot;Engines of Creation&quot; project.
<BR>
<P>-- Christine Peterson, President, Foresight Institute
