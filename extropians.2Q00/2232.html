<P>
One of the List's oldest lies:
<BR>
I hate to start the copy discussion again, but....
<BR>
<P>It took a lot of thought, but I finally have an explanation for my position
<BR>
on the question of killing copies.  This is not meant to change anyone's
<BR>
mind.  It is meant only to more clearly articulate my own view.  I'm don't
<BR>
think there is a right &quot;answer&quot; to this question.  I think that we each have
<BR>
different goals for uploading and making copies.  Different methods achieve
<BR>
different goals.  Here are my goals for uploading and copying.
<BR>
<P>The problem:
<BR>
Imagine that a perfect duplicate of me is made with a Star Trek transporter.
<BR>
Now there are two copies of me.  Some people believe that original can be
<BR>
destroyed and that I will continue to live in the new body.  Other people
<BR>
believe that there is semantically no &quot;original&quot; if the copies are
<BR>
identical, but still believe that one copy can be destroyed while I still
<BR>
live on.  These people claim that no murder has taken place, that I am still
<BR>
alive in a (new) body, and that I should have no objection to the procedure.
<BR>
I, however, object that the copy does not upload the original &quot;me&quot;, that the
<BR>
original &quot;me&quot; is murdered, and that I object to my death even if I live on
<BR>
(in another body).
<BR>
<P>My new explanation of my position:
<BR>
My goal in uploading or copying is not just to ensure some continuance of
<BR>
me.  Some people argue that my writings, recordings of me, or even the
<BR>
memories of my loved ones make me &quot;immortal.&quot;  No, my goal in uploading and
<BR>
copying is to avoid death.  Specifically, my death.  I know the copy problem
<BR>
leads to many semantic questions of &quot;what is death&quot; and &quot;who are you&quot; or
<BR>
&quot;which are you&quot;, or even the more radical &quot;you(1) aren't dead if you(2) are
<BR>
still alive.&quot;
<BR>
<P>What is death?  To me, what I am avoiding is loss of control.  I know that
<BR>
nobody has perfect control over their life or their future, but a permanent
<BR>
loss of consciousness or functionality is disturbing to me.  Ignoring the
<BR>
question of whether some part of me goes on, I still object to the death or
<BR>
loss of some part of me.
<BR>
<P>Some people will argue that the future me is so evolved and changed from the
<BR>
current me, that I might as well be dead.  I don't mind that.  I had a
<BR>
gradual change and some control over my growth into my future self.
<BR>
Hopefully, I had a lot of control in remaking myself in the future.  This is
<BR>
the opposite of what I fear in death.  Having lots of control to make
<BR>
radical changes in myself is Life.  Loss of control or the ability to grow
<BR>
or change is Death.
<BR>
<P>How does this affect the copy killing question?  When I get copied, I see
<BR>
another image of me.  I'm not 100% sure that it is me or a copy of me, just
<BR>
that I see what appears to be another me.  However, I am sure (meaning I
<BR>
believe or perceive, possibly inaccurately) that I still live in my original
<BR>
body.  It is this current body that I don't want to die.  My new copy will
<BR>
also probably believe that he is the original, and he also won't want to
<BR>
die.  The death of either one would destroy its function or its ability to
<BR>
choose and grow.  Either one would avoid that.  It is this death that I seek
<BR>
to avoid now, and will continue to seek to avoid after I am copied.  Having
<BR>
a copy does not change my agenda for avoiding death.
<BR>
<P>What about the argument that there was one &quot;me&quot; before, we copy and kill
<BR>
one, and there is still one &quot;me&quot; afterwards.  This is a specious argument.
<BR>
I could claim that unborn babies previously didn't exist, and therefore by
<BR>
killing anyone, I am not terminating any life, because the status quo
<BR>
returns.  In reality, the copy process has increased my life by a factor of
<BR>
two!  There are two humans called &quot;me&quot; at that point.  Killing one stops a
<BR>
heart, causes a loss of one consciousness, or reduces my(x2) ability to
<BR>
grown and choose.  Some would argue that they were the same person, so
<BR>
nothing is lost.  That's like replacing a lost arm with a duplicate clone of
<BR>
the other, and then claiming that you can chop it off again and I shouldn't
<BR>
care because they are the &quot;same&quot; arm.  No way, two arms are better than one.
<BR>
Two bodies are better than one.  If I grow to have two bodies at some point,
<BR>
and you want to destroy one so I am limited to half my bodies again, you are
<BR>
definitely killing tissue, and destroying my options.
<BR>
<P>So, ignoring the questions of &quot;life&quot;, &quot;death&quot;, &quot;one&quot; or &quot;two&quot; persons for a
<BR>
moment:  Does this view make sense?  Simply put, if I have multiple bodies,
<BR>
there is some damage or loss if you destroy one of them and reduce my total
<BR>
body count.  Doesn't this seem like a reasonable belief?
<BR>
<P>Now, I can see that destroying the brains of two bodies is similar to
<BR>
destroying a single hemisphere in one body.  The question are the same:  Did
<BR>
someone die, did half a person die, did anybody die?  In any case, there is
<BR>
a loss of brain function, personality growth potential and physical
<BR>
functionality.  I think that in the future, most copies will not want to be
<BR>
killed any more than someone will want to cut out parts of their brain.
<BR>
Maybe, it could be done for specific reasons in specific cases, but
<BR>
generally most brain copies would want to keep their functionality.  Just as
<BR>
today, most people don't want to lose brain tissue.  Even if I added brain
<BR>
tissue and expanded my brain, I wouldn't agree to have it chopped back to
<BR>
its original size.  Once I've gained conscious brain tissue, I don't want to
<BR>
lose it.  Likewise, it would be like erasing parts of my life memory.
<BR>
Unless something were horribly wrong, I don't want to lose any parts of my
<BR>
life.  A copy would be like another part of my life.
<BR>
<P>There also is the consideration that I still experience life from this body.
<BR>
Even if consciousness is copies or uploaded, I still seem to be where I
<BR>
started from.  Now a new copy of me may suddenly realize that he's been
<BR>
uploaded into a robot, but that doesn't help the poor sap still stuck in the
<BR>
meat brain.  The copy is almost like a child.  Maybe I desire to see my
<BR>
thoughts live on in others, just as some people seem to want to see their
<BR>
DNA live on through their children.  But that doesn't make me suicidal.  I
<BR>
still will protect my current vehicle of life so that I can continue to
<BR>
experience life.  The knowledge that someone else is having a good life has
<BR>
little direct influence on me.  Even if that someone else is an exact copy
<BR>
or even &quot;me&quot;.  If I only hear about that life via second-hand reports, it
<BR>
doesn't matter if it is &quot;me&quot;, as long as &quot;I&quot; am still experiencing something
<BR>
else.
<BR>
<P>The only true transfer I can see, is if the two brains are connected and a
<BR>
single consciousness is maintained.  If, instead of copying and having two
<BR>
people, the brains are integrated so that they communicate and function as
<BR>
one, and that one consciousness can equally experience either body, and can
<BR>
withdraw slowly from one body before it loses function, then I will believe
<BR>
that my consciousness has been transferred rather than duplicated.
<BR>
<P>How is this different than a copy-and-kill?  Because no second person is
<BR>
created, even temporarily.  Having a second person created and then killed
<BR>
would be similar to cloning me or having a twin and then killing that person
<BR>
for spare parts.  If the second body is grown without a brain or without a
<BR>
consciousness, then it would not be murder.  I think the same rules
<BR>
governing twins and clones naturally govern copies.  Once an independent
<BR>
body has independent thought and consciousness, it should not be destroyed.
<BR>
If the new body can be created without creating a new consciousness, and if
<BR>
there is only one consciousness that resides in one body, then both or
<BR>
neither and then one body, that meets my definition of a transfer rather
<BR>
than a copy-and-kill.
<BR>
<P>The summary?  I don't care how many branches of my consciousness continue
<BR>
on.  I am avoiding amputations or dead-ends of consciousness streams.
<BR>
That's my goal.  Other people can cut off their limbs, heads, brains,
<BR>
bodies, or whatever consciousness streams they want to, but I want to avoid
<BR>
that.   They have a different goal out of life.  I seek the continued life
<BR>
of every person/copy who wants it.  Some people seek the continued life of a
<BR>
single representative as being sufficient some previous group (or gestalt).
<BR>
<P>Sorry for rambling, but this is my new explanation.  I tried to ignore
<BR>
semantic arguments over &quot;what is me&quot; or &quot;what is death.&quot;  I have defined my
<BR>
requirements for a successful upload for my purposes.  I have defined my
<BR>
reasons for objecting to having conscious bodies of mine killed.  Whether
<BR>
these meet some definition of certain words, I don't care.  This is a
<BR>
description of what I want to accomplish and what I want to avoid.  Perhaps
<BR>
some people find that I am saving unnecessary parts of myself, but that's my
<BR>
plan.
<BR>
<P>Comments?  Wise-cracks?  Death threats to one copy only?
