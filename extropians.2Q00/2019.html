<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; As I have stated, the fact is that the only version of linux that is anywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; near being as easy to install as windows [snip] is the Corel release
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is a subjective judgement. Personally I find it the *hardest*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Why, just because I wanted to argue my &quot;it's subjective&quot; point?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No, because the install simply fails to work on many machines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please specify such machines.
</EM><BR>
<P>Out of six machines I tried, two failures. All were machines with
<BR>
supported hardware, which had successfully installed other
<BR>
distributions.
<BR>
<P>I do know from LUG mailing lists that others have had more problems than
<BR>
usual - but as I said before, I don't pass on rumours. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (and thus the only one qualified to be price compared for similar value)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm afraid I fail to understand this logic. When did we suddenly decide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the installation procedure (something most consumers never deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with anyway!) was the important factor in the value of an OS?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How easy it is for their computer tech to install determines what they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pay for their computer, right????
</EM><BR>
<P>I assume you mean this tounge-in-cheek, yes?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; argument, which I contested Judge Jackson's claim that consumers were harmed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; having to pay more for Windows (and thus any OS) than they should have had to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This aspect of the case was dealing with preinstalled copies of Windows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I agree that the Linux installation programs are not as easy as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Windows ones. But the vast majority of users have never installed any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; operating system themselves, and would also have difficulty with that of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Windows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One of the things most people have to do at least once themselves is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RE-install windows. With linux users, how many times do people recompile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their kernel?
</EM><BR>
<P>For purposes of general use, never. On current distributions there's no
<BR>
need to.
