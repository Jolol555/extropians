<P>
Let's see if I have this right.
<BR>
<P>First date thread seems to revolve around a question of what happens 
<BR>
emotionally when 'man A', who thinks he is intelligent, is seeking an equal 
<BR>
companion. He begins testing his new acquaintance with a series of 
<BR>
predetermined subjects. We assume he found her attractive enough to ask out 
<BR>
-- now he is ascertaining if she will interesting to talk with over an 
<BR>
extended period of time. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sets forth the subjects nearest and dearest to him -- or maybe ones he 
<BR>
feels are &quot;difficult&quot; (i.e., only an intelligent/educated person would know) 
<BR>
and then sits back and watches how the female deals with them. By this he 
<BR>
then decides if she is worthy of further conversation.  Because he realizes 
<BR>
that she may not be reacting 100% due to nervousness he is willing to go on 
<BR>
another date wit her, but how she orally replies to his tests determines how 
<BR>
he perceives her intelligence or lack thereof.  
<BR>
<P>'Female B' replies saying: this is condescending and self defeating. Women do 
<BR>
not respond well to verbal tests, we have our own set of tests, based on your 
<BR>
emotional and social skills (which she calls filters). By &quot;testing&quot; your 
<BR>
prospective mate in such a conspicuously precipitate manner (which women can 
<BR>
see through easily) you are not showing good manners or a considerate nature, 
<BR>
and you are inadvertently repelling the very type of female you seek. On an 
<BR>
aside: perhaps your inspection/experiment is not effective, since you are 
<BR>
bungling the information stream by putting forth your own ideas and not 
<BR>
researching the delicate terrain of a woman's mind, but rather trying to 
<BR>
force her into your pattern. 
<BR>
<P>Ergo: If she does not fit your design, it is your own inquest that has 
<BR>
muddled your judgment, not necessarily the lack of intelligence on behalf of 
<BR>
your date.
