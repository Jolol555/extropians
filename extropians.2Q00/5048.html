<P><EM>&gt; |&gt; THE SONY HANDYCAM:  some versions of Sony's Handycam came with infrared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |&gt; technology that allowed &quot;night shot&quot; mode. Sony recalled the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |&gt; product after it was discovered that, when the special feature was used in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; |&gt; daylight or a lighted room, it could see through clothing.

<EM>&gt; |Hey cool!  Where can I get one?  {8^D
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In standard hardware selling places.  You should know, though, that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changed the filtering so you cannot see through bathing suits. OTOH, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just added a filter filter, which you can remove if you know how. Details
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; float around on the net.
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought this might be an urban legend, but a search turned up
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.kaya-optics.com/products/applications.htm">http://www.kaya-optics.com/products/applications.htm</A>, showing how
<BR>
their near infra-red (NIR) filter does in fact let you see through
<BR>
some clothes.  They try to play up other purposes, but it seems pretty
<BR>
clear that voyeurism is the primary attraction.  Apparently it works
<BR>
with many kinds of 8mm camcorders and digital cameras.  They also tell
<BR>
you how to re-enable the Sony infrared mode for daytime use, by removing
<BR>
an internal microswitch.
<BR>
<P>The filter costs about $140-150 depending on the size needed.
