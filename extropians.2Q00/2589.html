<P><EM>&gt; &quot;Hi Dan.  I know you have no experience of being me, because you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still alive and kicking back on Earth.  I'm an exact copy of your self
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made from a remote highly advanced brain of your brain 2 days before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the new year.  I regret to inform you that your continued existence is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to end in a few years from a gamma ray burst before your planet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; develops upload technology. That's the reason this alien ship I'm on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made the copy while they happened to be traveling through our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular solar system.  I hope you can find comfort knowing that at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least a copy of your prior self will make it past this apocalypse.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Take care.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>While I'd certainly take steps to keep this body from getting caught in
<BR>
the blast, (assuming that I took this person who claimed to be me
<BR>
seriously,) believe it or not, and I know this may be unthinkable to
<BR>
you, I'd probably think in response to hearing a communique like this:
<BR>
&quot;Whew.  THAT was a close one.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I know Harvey and I agree this is not acceptable, because our current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inner selves will not experience a continuation of consciousness.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Worse, in this fictional scenario, we have a short future to look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forward to - one in which we will be vaporized into non-existence.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So the question (yes or no), do you share the sense of loss that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Harvey and I have, that the you I'm talking to right now will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really.  I'd actually find a great deal of comfort in knowing that a
<BR>
copy of me would manage to avoid the blast. I'd be under about as much
<BR>
distress as I'd be under if I became aware that I was going to undergo
<BR>
retroactive amnesia or something to that effect. In short, it would bother
<BR>
me a little, I'd try to avoid it, etc. but not really all THAT much.
<BR>
<P>It would be a real shame forgetting New Year's, I had a really good time
<BR>
in Barcelona with my girlfriend.  But there will be other millennia.
