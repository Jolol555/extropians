<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Only if the transparency works both ways and the people doing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;surveillance are themselves under surveillance, but of course that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;impossible. The President would never agree to have a camera in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the oval office so all the world could see what he's doing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The President might not agree to have a tape recorder in the Oval Office
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either (remember Nixon?) and he might not agree to have reporters all over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the world digging into his background to bring all his dusty skeletons to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the light of day (remember Clinton?), but the fact of the matter is that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; President does not make the laws, that is the job of Congress.  And once a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law is passed, the President (last I checked) is just as subject to it as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you and me (remember Clinton again?).
</EM><BR>
<P>Only if the President signs the law. If he vetos it, his veto needs to be
<BR>
overridden, and even if congress overrides it, the president can sue the
<BR>
congress through the supreme court, justly claiming not only a violation of
<BR>
privacy, but an infringement of congress upon the integrity and independence of
<BR>
the executive branch from the congress.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;and besides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I can always use encryption for things I don't want you to know about.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No encryption is unbreakable, that is just a fact.  Further, if such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cypherpunk activities are criminalized, the very act of attempting to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encryption for the purpose of tampering with the public record would likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be construed to be a forfeiture of your rights.
</EM><BR>
<P>No encryption is unbreakable, however, there is plenty of encryption that is
<BR>
only breakable if you are willing to work on it until the end of the universe.
<BR>
If you encrypt your own data, that is YOUR record, not the public record. Once
<BR>
you've encrypted and looped in counterfeit data, you are free of the system, and
<BR>
the system doesn't know you are free of it. Once you've done it for yourself,
<BR>
you can do it for others.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I'll find the camera, splice into the video line, and play back a recording
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reading the Bible, saluting the flag, and generally being a good little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;boy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Now I can do what I want.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Until you are caught (which will probably be quite likely) and then you will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be sorry.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, now thats effective. Criminals commit crimes fully aware of their chances of
<BR>
getting caught. They do what they do anyways, and they have no regard for penny
<BR>
ante threats of 'you'll be sorry'...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;There are far too many cameras for somebody to be watching all of them all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of the time, I'll do it when nobody is watching.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I imagine that the video will be monitored by AI (or very powerful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unintelligent computers) for suspicious activity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now you are getting into processing, which you earlier claimed would not be
<BR>
necessary.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yeah, yeah I know this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; takes a lot more computational ability than is possible in 2000 a.d., right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Well, I ain't talking about a system that will be put in place this year.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Computers that can automatically search through telephone traffic for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keywords have existed since at least the 1970s.
</EM><BR>
<P>Echelon originally dealt only with telegraph/telex data. Voice keyword
<BR>
technology, so far as I know, wasn't available until the NSA put its main
<BR>
facility online in the 1980s, with several hundred supercomputers, and at that
<BR>
point dealt only with satellite phone traffic, and they had to prioritize
<BR>
certain regions, because they couldn't handle all calls made everywhere, and so
<BR>
far as I know, with the explosion of the number of phone lines and the different
<BR>
types of data being sent, they still don't have the capability to filter all
<BR>
data all the time.
<BR>
<P>This is why I think your claims are so unreasonable. Your system would mandate
<BR>
that every person on the planet have the same capaiblities that the NSA still
<BR>
doesn't have (openness and mutuality is useless unless everyone has the same
<BR>
capaiblities to use the system).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't think it is much of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a stretch to extrapolate this technology to inclulde video feeds in the next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 10-20 years.h
</EM><BR>
<P>As the capability to analyse data increases, the amount of data needed to be
<BR>
processed also increases. Since the system is open, everyone will know the
<BR>
surveillance algorythms, and so those algorythms will be outmoded almost
<BR>
instantly, at least as quickly as people here keep poking holes in your ideas.
<BR>
As the amount of information being processed doubles at least as quickly as
<BR>
Moore's Law increases the capaiblities of the processors, you are dealing with a
<BR>
queen's race that you will never win.
