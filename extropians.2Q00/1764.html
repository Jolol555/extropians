Michael should love this post, I'm picking up bad habits and quoting up the wazoo.

<EM>        &gt;&gt;the B-2 bomber (which is a stealth bomber) costs around $800 million [...] A B-2 bomber weighs
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;over 400,000 lb. which equals 6.4 million ounces. An ounce of gold goes for around $250-300, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;makes the weight of the B-2 in gold equal to about $1.6-1.95 billion, so no, the B-2 is decidedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>        &gt;&gt;NOT worth its weight in gold,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;The cost per airplane is about 2 billion, but the military can get very creative with
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;their accounting when they want good PR, you could probably get a $800 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;figure if you ignored the huge R&amp;D bill (mostly D), but as there are no plans to build
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;any more of these white elephants that doesn't seem like good accounting practice to me.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;Michael :
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;I don't know where you are getting this figure, as the $800 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;figure was one calculated by the opponents of the B-2 to make it look as
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;expensive as possible (even though that figure includes lots of stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;other than just the airplane). I imagine you are cooking this up in
</EM><BR>
<EM>       &gt;order to win the argument, as you seem to be acting very stubbornly
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;obtuse in this thread.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK I admit it, you seemed so confident, so certain that you made me doubt myself.
<BR>
The &quot;worth its weight in gold&quot; line didn't seem the sort of thing I would make up but I
<BR>
couldn't remember where I got the idea. Is it possible, is it even conceivable
<BR>
that John Clark could actually be wrong about something? Well I just checked
<BR>
and although I thought I might be wrong it turns out I was mistaken, I'm right again.
<BR>
<P>The book &quot;The B2 Spirit&quot; by Walter J Boyne (an Aviation Week Editor) was
<BR>
published just last month, it's clearly pro B2 and yet in the introduction I find this:
<BR>
<P>&quot;With all the R&amp;D costs now allocated to just 21 aircraft the unit cost has risen
<BR>
drastically to the point opponents now call each aircraft -not just the program- a
<BR>
2 billion dollar blunder&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I also find that the B2 does not weigh over 400,000 lb as Michael said, the empty weight
<BR>
is only 125,000 lb and even at maximum takeoff weight it's only 336,500 lb. So when I
<BR>
said the B2 was literally worth its weight in gold I was not engaging in hyperbolae I was
<BR>
actually being too conservative, even if you count a full load of fuel and bombs and crew.
<BR>
As I said the military mind is not concerned with cost. Oh well, at least we have the stealth bra.
