Journal of the American College of Nutrition 19(2): 242-255 2000
<BR>
<P>Abstract:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Objective: To examine associations of midlife tofu consumption
<BR>
with brain function and structural changes in late life.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Methods: The design utilized surviving participants of a longitudinal
<BR>
study established in 1965 for research on heart disease, stroke, and
<BR>
cancer. Information on consumption of selected foods was available
<BR>
from standardized interviews conducted 1965-1967 and 1971-1974.
<BR>
A 4-level composite intake index defined &quot;low-low&quot; consumption as
<BR>
fewer than two servings of tofu per week in 1965 and no tofu in the prior
<BR>
week in 1971. Men who reported two or more servings per week at both
<BR>
interviews were defined as &quot;high-high&quot; consumers. Intermediate or less
<BR>
consistent &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot; consumption levels were also defined.
<BR>
Cognitive functioning was tested at the 1991-1993 examination, when
<BR>
participants were aged 71 to 93 years (n=3734). Brain atropy was
<BR>
assessed using neuroimage (n=574) and autopsy (n=290) information.
<BR>
Cognitive function data were also analyzed for wives of a sample of
<BR>
study partcipants (n=502) who had been living with the participants at
<BR>
the time of their dietary interviews.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Results: Poor cognitive test performance, enlargement of ventricles
<BR>
and low brain weight were each significantly and independently
<BR>
associated with higher tofu consumption. A similar association of midlife
<BR>
tofu intake with poor late life cognitive test scores was also observed
<BR>
among wives of cohort members, using the husbands answers to food
<BR>
frequency questions as proxy for the wife's consumption. Statistically
<BR>
significant associations were consistently demonstrated in linear
<BR>
multivariate regression models. Odds ratios comparing endpoints
<BR>
among &quot;high-high&quot; with &quot;low-low&quot; consumers were mostly in the range
<BR>
of 1.6 to 2.0.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusions: In this population, higher midlife tofu consumption was
<BR>
independently associated with indicators of cognitive impairment and
<BR>
brain atrophy in late life.
<BR>
<P><P>Additional note by poster:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; Tofu genistein may induce brain atropy by inhibiting adult neurogenesis,
<BR>
as follows.&quot;
