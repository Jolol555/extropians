<P>&lt;&lt; By the way, we should feel a great loss even if he had
<BR>
&nbsp;been frozen, since the odds of success don't seem that
<BR>
&nbsp;great.  Which isn't to say we shouldn't try.
<BR>
&nbsp;(I'm signed up with Alcor.)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;One lesson we might want to learn here is that we brainy
<BR>
&nbsp;discuss big ideas types might try to pay more attention
<BR>
&nbsp;to the emotional health of those among us. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Yes try Alcor, try vitamins and diet-reduction, try getting the investors to 
<BR>
fund gene repair more heavily, support nanotech, promote a cleaner 
<BR>
environment, promote reasonable moves in support of massive extermination 
<BR>
weapons to be controlled better, all that and much more. 
<BR>
<P>Now, at the end of the day, also consider the exploration of things we have 
<BR>
almost little knowledge of and can only conjecture-the remote future. For me, 
<BR>
its the hope that, as in another thread, we may find some reason to hope to 
<BR>
of seeing those that have passed from our lives.  Sometimes its mentally, 
<BR>
healthier, to let go of those who have died and accept the permanence of 
<BR>
their deaths.  On the other hand, some of us fools, understand the need to 
<BR>
hang on to a shred of hope, however, unlikely.  Some of us, (not for 
<BR>
everyone!) find some comfort in the crazy notion that a bit of wisdom, and a 
<BR>
bit caring, may outlast eternal extinction.
