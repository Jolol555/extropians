<BR>
<P>Previous authors:
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;&gt;&gt;Typically, more foolish (or naive) people are ego-stricken and have
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;&gt;a &quot;need&quot; to go about blabbing how smart and knowledgeable they are,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;&gt;while a true wise one is more likely to keep quiet allowing the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;&gt;observer to ask, bear and learn... really learn... with dignity.&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&gt;Your statement is heartwarming, but false.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not entirely false; but not entirely correct. Perhaps I can offer a few
<BR>
other points
<BR>
- people sometimes say things not to prove how smart they are, but to
<BR>
educate other people, perhaps the trick is to determine the individuals
<BR>
character from the personality over a period of time to see if this is the
<BR>
case;
<BR>
- wiser/learning_oriented people are perhaps more proactive in dialogue,
<BR>
asking questions and continually feeding their mind, by being inquisitive,
<BR>
they perhaps are more proactive in using their smarts and knowledge to bring
<BR>
in more information;
<BR>
- blabbing how smart/knowledgelable you are, and more generally some form of
<BR>
'boasting', is an important tactic if you have social goals; not all wise
<BR>
people have social goals, but some do; the question is how a person goes
<BR>
about this, to make way for interesting conversation or to sway/direct
<BR>
opinion and authority;
<BR>
<P>Lee Daniel Crocker:
<BR>
<EM> &gt;It is a handy heuristic sometimes for judging the value of an opinion
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;from someone unknown: how vocally does the speaker spout eir credentials
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;or experience in the field, and impugn those of others?  Those most
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;competent in a field are generally content to give their opinions as if
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;they are &quot;obvious&quot; rather than giving them value because of their &gt;source.
</EM><BR>
<P>To some degree credentials are important, the fact that someone slips 'when
<BR>
I studied engineering' into their conversation suggests where the boundaries
<BR>
of assumptions are, but scaling down to a 'war over credentials' tends to be
<BR>
petty. Over time, credentials tend to become less important once mutual
<BR>
relationships/understandings/etc build. But there's a line between doing
<BR>
this and continual 'when I ...', or 'when I studied as an engineer and was a
<BR>
magnus cum idiot ...', or 'when i got my MBA from XYZ ...', or 'when I
<BR>
studied at ...'
<BR>
<P>(perhaps also wiser people realise how being too smart/boastful impedes the
<BR>
flow of ideas/conversation, because of automatic limitations that other
<BR>
people will invoke ...)
<BR>
<P>Here's an paraphrase dialogue from a conversation I recently had:
<BR>
<P>other 'there was an an australian prime minister called sluter'
<BR>
me 'i don't think so'
<BR>
o 'yes, i'm sure of it, my friend visited australia'
<BR>
m 'i'm sure they did, but i was educated and spent 20 or so years of my life
<BR>
there, and although i can't recall all prime ministers off the top of my
<BR>
head, sluter does not ring a bell'
<BR>
o 'i'm sure there is a prime minister called sluter'
<BR>
m 'i don't think so, but we can check a reference'
<BR>
o 'i think there is, you'll find'
<BR>
m 'i don't think so, tomorrow i'll look up a reference, and find out'
<BR>
o 'i think you'll find there is one'
<BR>
m 'lets leave it until tomorrow'
<BR>
(a day later)
<BR>
m 'i checked a reference, no prime minister called sluter'
<BR>
o 'ohh, i'm sure that's what my friend said'
<BR>
m 'they probably did, but if so, they were wrong'
<BR>
...
<BR>
<P>it's my bugbear, communication is a pretty interesting thing having lived in
<BR>
different places, the most subtle nuance or meaning can mean so much to one
<BR>
person, but so little to someone else; personally I prefer direct straight
<BR>
talking, but that's not always the best approach for all situations; cest la
<BR>
vie!
<BR>
<P>Matthew.
