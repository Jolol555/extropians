<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the evidence showing that the only other potentially comparable OS

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;As a quick point (I am writing other replies to this thread).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Although said free OS can be aquired for $50 on CD, it can also be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; aquired on CD for $2, or often given away free. I don't think it's fair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to say it's 'typically' bought for $50.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I bought SuSe on a CD that was part of a linux book, that retailed for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;$49.00. I bought it on remainder at a used book store for $15. A used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;dual processor server I just bought from a guy for $50 happened to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a Red Hat cd stuck in the drive (and he just moved out to Arizona, oh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;well ;) ), so you could say i got that for free. But I doubt that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;people are as cheap as I am.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well for those who still think that there's no lunch like a free one, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can chow down at:

<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.linux.org/dist/ftp.html">http://www.linux.org/dist/ftp.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>from that site, I quote:
<BR>
&quot;The following FTP sites offer the Linux Kernel, assorted distributions,
<BR>
software applications, drivers, documentation, and more. Although Linux is
<BR>
&quot;free&quot;, not all distributions are free for
<BR>
&nbsp;the taking. Some versions may be downloaded at no charge. Virtually all
<BR>
distributions are also available for purchase on CD or floppy disk. Please refer
<BR>
to our Linux Retailer page for
<BR>
&nbsp;more information. &quot;
<BR>
<P>As I have stated, the fact is that the only version of linux that is anywhere
<BR>
near being as easy to install as windows is (and thus the only one qualified to
<BR>
be price compared for similar value), is the Corel release, CLOS, which retails
<BR>
for $59.00 for the basic and $89.00 for the delux edtion. These prices are very
<BR>
much in line with the prices for windows' various flavors, so the original
<BR>
argument, which I contested Judge Jackson's claim that consumers were harmed by
<BR>
having to pay more for Windows (and thus any OS) than they should have had to.
<BR>
<P>This demonstration is totally leaving aside the fact that the case does not
<BR>
recognize new developments in the market, it merely looks at the market at the
<BR>
time that the suit was submitted, as a snapshot of frozen time. At the time of
<BR>
the original suit, the primary competitors were MacOS, OS/2, and various
<BR>
commercial flavors of Unix, all of which retailed at far higher prices than
<BR>
Windows did. At that time, Apple had a monopoly on the market for
<BR>
motorola-compatible PC's, to an even greater extent than MS can have ever been
<BR>
said to dominate the Intel-compatible market.
<BR>
<P>The original basis for the suit, which was the bundling charge for including IE
<BR>
for free, has now been tossed, since its been shown that giving consumers a
<BR>
product for free does not harm them, it only harms competitors, and while there
<BR>
may be charges pending for dumping violations, that is not part of anti-trust
<BR>
law at all.
