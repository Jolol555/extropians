I am
<BR>
hopeful that he was cryonically suspended in a reasonable amount of
<BR>
time, and that his brain was in good shape. It would be a shame for us
<BR>
to lose him for eternity.
<BR>
------------------------------
<BR>
I concur.  I hope he has been cryonically suspended as well, and that
<BR>
his brain is in good condition.  That would be the only good thing
<BR>
that could have come of his death - a chance for a second shot at life.
<BR>
<P>I am new to this list, but have known Sasha for 6-7 years on-line and
<BR>
about 3 IRL.  He was a really great person, and I will miss him 
<BR>
immensely. 
<BR>
<P>I hope his Web Site will be kept up, and that people can collect his
<BR>
postings to this list, and other idea exchanges that have been had 
<BR>
with Sasha so that his work may continue to live on and influence 
<BR>
people to make the world a better place.  It would be nice to have a
<BR>
Sasha Chislenko memorial site where people could post works of his
<BR>
that are not currently on his existing site, and also can post fond
<BR>
reminiscences and so on.  This would be one way that Sasha could 
<BR>
continue to live on in cyberspace as he had hoped. 
<BR>
<P>I will be at the wake tomorrow.  It is a very sad time for me.  
<BR>
Sasha was a good friend for many years, but he died with unresolved
<BR>
conversations between us of both intellectual and emotional nature,
<BR>
and I don't know what the conclusions would have been, and it is too
<BR>
possibly that I never will.  My life will be all the more empty without
<BR>
his input and ideas on all the vagaries of intellectual and emotional
<BR>
life here on earth. 
<BR>
<P>Sasha will be sorely missed by all who knew him, he was a special 
<BR>
person and it is very sad to lose him.
<BR>
<P>I will miss Sasha very much.
<BR>
Today is a very sad day for me.
<BR>
<P>LL+P,
<BR>
Stephan
