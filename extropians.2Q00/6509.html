domesticated maize (central Mexico)
<BR>
<P>domesticated chicken (I have Araucanas which, I believe, were domesticated
<BR>
in Peru)
<BR>
<P>domesticated &quot;Irish&quot; potato (Peru)
<BR>
<P>domesticated sweet potato (not sure where)
<BR>
<P>fire (Africa?)
<BR>
<P>At the time these innovations occurred people seem to have been living in
<BR>
small kinship groups.  Since such groups have varied customs and practices,
<BR>
it's hard to say anything about the social structure, other than that there
<BR>
was no &quot;centralized&quot; authority telling all the groups of a region what they
<BR>
must do or refrain from doing.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on what I know of human nature, I believe that technical innovation
<BR>
was most likely to have occurred in groups where custom allowed individuals
<BR>
the freedom to experiment with different ways of doing daily work.
<BR>
Domestication of food crops would have been most likely to occur in groups
<BR>
where individuals and their kin were free to directly benefit from the any
<BR>
work they might do to harvest more food than they needed at the moment and
<BR>
store it for future use.  In situations where this was not the case, such as
<BR>
where neighboring groups frequently raided each other's camps, I would not
<BR>
expect food domestication to have caught on.
<BR>
<P>The case where neighboring tribes frequently raid each other's camps is
<BR>
analogous to the case where certain groups of people calling themselves &quot;the
<BR>
government&quot; raid their neighbor's bank accounts. However, as long as the
<BR>
raiding is kept within tolerable limits, it's not a barrier to innovation.
<BR>
(the best parasite is that which allows its host to thrive)(better yet is
<BR>
the parasite which actually benefits its host, like the bacteria in our
<BR>
guts)
