<P>
<EM>&gt; Although the wording suggests otherwise, I think this is primarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intended to be a body which makes *moral* recommendations.  They aren't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there to give technical advice.
</EM><BR>
<P>They explicitly include [philosophers] in their suggestion.  I doubt that
<BR>
they want people to offer advice on aesthetics or eternal recurrence or
<BR>
something.  (Well, we don't need them, either, since philosophy's purview
<BR>
has finally become usurped by science.)  They're probably referring to
<BR>
philosophers of ethics and religious practitioners.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't think it will be possible to find a group of people who have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;collective authority&quot; on upcoming moral issues, especially in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; context of a world with incredible diversity of cultures.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps this is the closest thing to agreeing---in Bill Joy's classic
<BR>
words---[as a species] to the application of science and technology.  So
<BR>
the sixty members of the U.N. Genomics Council will all vote and by means
<BR>
of a simple majority reassure us that our species is unified.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is it really plausible that the religious countries where women must go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; veiled and drug use leads to execution can agree with European countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where women go topless on the beach and drugs are freely available?
</EM><BR>
<P>While there are nations where religious dictums are explicitly and strongly
<BR>
represented in the law I'd say that the United States (where I live) is a
<BR>
rather religious country, partly in terms of law and very much so in terms
<BR>
of populace.  It's not unreasonable to suspect that a fair amount of the
<BR>
collective ethical objections to genetic engineering in the U.S. and Europe
<BR>
is ultimately derived from religious conviction or influence (although
<BR>
there are plenty of religious people who have no problem with it).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But in proposing to advise political and business leaders I think the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea is to remove some options from end users, to take away their freedom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to make their own decisions.
</EM><BR>
<P>All right, that penultimate paragraph has gotten us all suspicious now.  So
<BR>
what can we do now to encourage open research, development, and
<BR>
communication?
