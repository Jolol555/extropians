OK privacy fans, now I have the facts.  I just learned this morning
<BR>
that my neighbor is into small electric airplanes when I saw him
<BR>
out flying one.  I learned that there are kits available commercially
<BR>
to build these for about US$300, which includes the radios, servos,
<BR>
battery packs and motors.  This particular model is 175 grams, of
<BR>
which 51 grams are high performance NiCd batteries.  If you dont
<BR>
need half an hour endurance, lighter batteries can be carried.
<BR>
<P>This one was not all that small: the wing is a 40 cm diameter ring
<BR>
of kevlar with a single layer of mylar stretched across it, then
<BR>
smaller loops for the horizontal stabilizer.  This particular model
<BR>
is actually an indoor plane, but can be flown outdoors on very
<BR>
still days.  Top speed is around 12-15 kph, so it is easy to stay
<BR>
under it at a good trotting pace.
<BR>
<P>My neighbor says there are camera kits available with mass
<BR>
around 15 grams for a couple K$.  The noise is noticable
<BR>
but not annoying: a high pitched whirrrrr.  With this model
<BR>
you can lose an additional about ~8 grams by removing the
<BR>
landing gear, making it a hand launch and use a breakaway
<BR>
propeller for landings.
<BR>
<P>So, now we know what would be involved with current
<BR>
tech if someone wanted to invade the privacy of our back
<BR>
yards: ~2300 bucks.
<BR>
<P>For those in the CA Bay area, I understand they have
<BR>
a club that meets and flies in that big hangar out at
<BR>
Moffett Field the third Saturday of every month.  Ill
<BR>
check it out next weekend and report back.  spike
