</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hi Extropians,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm a serious practioner of the dark arts of life extension. Offlist I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spoken to a few extropian/transhumanist people who also are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Perhaps extropy.com might want to host a small mailing list for people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually practise the discipline of LE?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What do the gods of extropy.com say?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You know,  I need to talk with people who are doing CR; who are using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aminoguanidine; tocotrienols etc.... compare notes and such. Maybe others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;feel the way I do?
</EM><BR>
<P>I want to live forever as much as the next person, but I can't convince 
<BR>
myself that LE is more worthwhile than my own personal rule of thumb: 
<BR>
&quot;Everything in moderation.&quot;  Not being a nutritionist, chemist or biologist 
<BR>
myself, I'd basically have to rely on what someone else said is the real 
<BR>
good stuff to ingest.  And as for CR, well I'm too much the Epicurean to 
<BR>
want to live forever if it meant thousands of years of wheat germ and carrot 
<BR>
juice.
<BR>
<P>But perhaps if the research were compelling enough to show that one or 
<BR>
another LE method was sufficiently likely to add a chunk of years onto my 
<BR>
life, I'd be interested in looking into it.  I know Durk &amp; Sandy of the LEF 
<BR>
have been researching/experimenting on themselves for a couple decades now.  
<BR>
Anybody know whether they (or any other long term LE'ers) are reaping any 
<BR>
benefits?
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
<BR>
