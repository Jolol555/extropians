<EM>&gt; &gt; Sounds a lot like Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, a game that I love but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; think could be made even greater.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (It is interesting to note that besides his collectivist/fascist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ideas, Chairman Yang has the best transhumanist quotes in the game -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Provost Zakharov is fun but far too much research for research's own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sake in his quotes to be a real transhumanist)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the seven default characters were all designed with positive and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; negative aspects, to provide something to love or hate depending on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether you usually played as them or against them.  Even more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting is that most of the positive aspects lead towards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumanism in one form or another - Deidre through merging with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ecosystem she protects, Yang as you noted, Morgan through engineering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all kinds of new abilities, and Zakharov...well, just listen to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Voice of the Planet snippet. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Overall, that sequence is also a nice picture of the Singularity, with
<BR>
its lovely information overload and Planet turning into white light.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And then there's the both-libertarian-and-beauraucratic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Peacekeepers...
</EM><BR>
<P>I have always enjoyed Lal's hypocricy - sermonising about the
<BR>
sancticity of life and the individual, but hoping to clone his
<BR>
beloved. 
<BR>
<P>I dream about making my own game in the same style, but deliberately
<BR>
focusing on transhumanism. After all, it is a bit odd that you still
<BR>
need farming and mines after you get nanotech, for example. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If I recall correctly, this is not the first time that the nature of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lot of this game's quotes has been cited on this list.  I, myself, have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been able to explain some of my dreams as &quot;what they have in this game,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only make it available to us in reality,&quot; to those who might not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understood any other way.  I wonder...what might it take, to encourage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more popular fiction with these themes, so that those who grow up to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emulate the stories they see have choices other than Frankenstein
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (movies, not the original book) and &quot;anything you don't understand must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be evil&quot; modes?
</EM><BR>
<P>Just the fact that these elements have become an important part of a
<BR>
game that has sold quite well is telling. Our memes are spreading.
