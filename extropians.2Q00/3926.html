Ayn Rand wrote that the visual arts &quot;teach man to see more precisely and to
<BR>
find DEEPER MEANING in his field of vision&quot; and that the art is &quot;a SELECTIVE
<BR>
RE-CREATION of REALITY according to an artist's metaphysical
<BR>
value-judgments.&quot;
<BR>
<P>(Since I did not read Rand's books I¹m not sure but) I suggest,
<BR>
inconsiderately, that Rand¹s aesthetics may have ³something² in common with
<BR>
the s.c. constructivist aesthetics.
<BR>
<P>Silvio Ceccato (1964) developed Bridgman's idea of operational definitions
<BR>
into a comprehensive system of mental operations. He emphasized the
<BR>
³constitutive² capability of the mind and the role of a pulsating ATTENTION
<BR>
that governs the generation of concepts (like artistic CREATION, artistic
<BR>
RE-CREATION, beauty, but also semantics) by separating and relating the raw
<BR>
material of sensory differences. On these premises he worked out a detailed
<BR>
model of a thinking organism that was able to construct an experiential
<BR>
world (even without ³representational² input from an external reality).
<BR>
Ceccato developed also concepts (relevant in the artistic domain) like
<BR>
communication &amp; &quot;enrichment&quot;, etc.
<BR>
<P>Modern (rectius: radical) constructivism is based on the following basic
<BR>
principles: knowledge is not passively received either through the senses or
<BR>
by way of communication, but is actively built up by the cognising subject;
<BR>
the function of cognition is adaptive and serves the subject's organization
<BR>
of the experiential world, not the discovery of an objective ontological
<BR>
reality.
<BR>
<P>The importance of constructivism is best understood by comparing it with the
<BR>
traditional approach in epistemology or cognitive science, which sees
<BR>
knowledge as a passive reflection of the external, objective reality. The
<BR>
traditional view is that our senses work like a camera that just projects an
<BR>
image of how the world &quot;really&quot; is onto our brain, and use that image as a
<BR>
kind of map, an encoding in a slightly different format of the objective
<BR>
structure &quot;out there&quot;. Such a view runs quickly into a host of conceptual
<BR>
problems, mainly because it ignores the infinite complexity of the world.
<BR>
Observation reveals that cognition does not work like that. It rather turns
<BR>
out that the subject is actively generating plenty of potential models, and
<BR>
that the role of the outside world is merely limited to reinforcing some of
<BR>
these models while eliminating others (SELECTION). Of course: constructivism
<BR>
has its roots in Kant's synthesis of rationalism and empiricism.
<BR>
<P>(I must buy that book, just to see if &amp; how much my spaghetti-speculation is
<BR>
wrong!)
