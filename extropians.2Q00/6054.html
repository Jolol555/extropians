If for no other reason than I feel like talking, I'll continue
<BR>
this thread, but actually, now it's about flies.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; You see, it could be worse, Adrian... you could be a fly!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.amara.com/flydates.jpg">http://www.amara.com/flydates.jpg</A> &lt;-- click here to know what I mean :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I could be a fly dating a spider that just looked like a fly, with my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;luck on that front. At least I wouldn't be looking for lips in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that case. ^_^;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>While I was giggling about Larson's fly dates cartoon (*), I was
<BR>
thinking that a good antidote for someone who is down, but maybe not
<BR>
too much down/unreachable, is to tell him/her that their life could be
<BR>
worse -- they could be a fly! For some reason, that perspective
<BR>
just tickles my funny bone.
<BR>
<P>I've been watching flies alot lately. I have a high humidity problem
<BR>
in my flat, and so I do my best to control the moisture by opening
<BR>
the doors and windows alot. But you see, the flats where I live rarely
<BR>
have screens, so the indigenous insect life enjoys visiting me when
<BR>
I have my door and windows open.
<BR>
<P>Among those wonderful creatures is  a healthy fly population, which
<BR>
I am able to control with a highly advanced piece of technology called
<BR>
&quot;fly paper&quot;. Auf Deutsch: &quot;Fliegenfaenger&quot;, or &quot;Fly Catcher&quot;. This &quot;paper&quot;
<BR>
is a strip about 2 feet long, 2 inches wide, coated with sticky
<BR>
gooey stuff and I hang it at one end of my kitchen from the bottom
<BR>
of a kitchen cupboard. The flies fly to it and stick. Maybe they
<BR>
buzz their wings for 10 minutes or so, but then they are dead.
<BR>
The fly paper is disgusting but effective.
<BR>
<P>For me, the whole process is a lesson in fly stupidity. What
<BR>
intelligent creature would fly into something that is already
<BR>
holding 15 or 20 carcasses of its brethren? Probably Richard Feynman
<BR>
could think of some interesting games to play with flies, like those
<BR>
that he devised for ants.
<BR>
<P>And when my landlords tell me that I didn't do enough to control
<BR>
the moisture and mildew in my flat, I can hold up my fly-spattered
<BR>
gooey strip as proof that my door and windows were open :-).
<BR>
<P><P>Anway, thought I'd share my deep thoughts with you on this rainy evening.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>(*) Does anyone else find Larson cartoons incrediby funny? Maybe I'm
<BR>
working far too many hours, and am simply punchy now, but his cartoons
<BR>
are just what I need to put me into an uncontrollable fit of giggles.
<BR>
<P>Here's another one that I like:
