<EM>&gt; This is just a special case of a much more general (and obvious) rule: no

<EM>&gt; form of software can ever perform a computation that could not, in

<EM>&gt; principle, be done by the hardware it runs on.

I think this needs to be phrased differently.  I can write a program
<BR>
to take the square root of a number that the hardware executing that
<BR>
program simply cannot do.  I can also design hardware that would
<BR>
take the square root of a number that would be incapable of executing
<BR>
said program.  Hardware that can execute programs and compute square
<BR>
roots would by definition be larger than either case separately.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly, there is a lot of work going on now to allow programs
<BR>
to reformat the hardware (typically a sea-of-gates) to execute parts
<BR>
of the program more efficiently.  If this trend continues, it would
<BR>
allow large fractions of the hardware to be dedicated to special
<BR>
purpose &quot;programs&quot;.  That raises interesting question regarding comparisons
<BR>
with the brain/mind, where the question is what fraction of
<BR>
the brain's computronium can you actually divert to focus on a single
<BR>
problem.  It is certainly true that all of the sensory/motor and
<BR>
much of the memory hardware is dedicated and cannot be reused
<BR>
for other purposes.
