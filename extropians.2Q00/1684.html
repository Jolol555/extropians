<EM>&gt;     &gt;(i.e. production exceeded demand).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's just natures way of telling farmers that you're making too much of something,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you ignore natures advice you go broke, as well you should.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, thats a given. Then what happens?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;And how quickly do you think it would take for them [oil workers] to go into another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;line of work?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know. Perhaps it could happen quickly, or perhaps it would take a long time to teach
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them how to make Mr. Fusion machines, if so the fusion industry would be handicapped by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a labor shortage and the demise of the oil business would be delayed.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are a) assuming Mr. Fusion Inc would want to hire union workers, and b) need to hire anywhere
<BR>
near as many people to produce machines that produce the same power demands as the former energy
<BR>
industry. If it takes a while for all this to happen, then the excess workers can find other lines of
<BR>
work in relative order. If it happens fast, the economy can't take up the slack that fast, which has
<BR>
been my central point. When industries are made obsolete in less time than it takes to train a person
<BR>
for a new career, you will have the makings of a severe recession, if not a depression.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;Take a look at Russia right now. Its been 10 years since their defense industry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;collapsed  (about 50% of their entire economy)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; From an economic viewpoint defense is a drain not a fundamental source of wealth,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's like paying millions of people to build pyramids or dig holes and then fill them up again.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From an economic viewpoint, defense spending is an excellent incubator for research and development.
</EM><BR>
Perhaps R&amp;D is now faster here in the US with the stock markets financing R&amp;D now, but the USSR was
<BR>
certainly getting more technological infrastructure developed before 1990 than in the few years
<BR>
therafter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;Any new industry is not going to be burdened, and will not want to be burdened by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;unionized employees.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe, but most &quot;new economy&quot; companies are not unionized and their employees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't seem to be suffering much. But I don't want to talk about unions, it's just too dull.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;They will automate as much of their manufacturing as  possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you're saying that eventually machines will be able to do everything better than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human beings then I agree, but is that really your point, we were after all talking about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1929.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the 20's, farms were mortgaging their farms based on relatively high prices due to large exports
<BR>
of grain, and they were using the money to buy tractors, harvesters, chemical fertilizers, irrigation
<BR>
systems, etc. As a result, farm production went up. When grain shipments to europe got cut off, and
<BR>
interest rates rose, food was left rotting on the docks and in the fields, prices collapsed, and
<BR>
farmers could not recover their investment. The automation of farms in the 20's is analogous to
<BR>
automation of manufacturing today.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; Would you have invested in CISCO telephone wire routers if you knew that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;another technology was 12 months down the road that would give you 100x
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;the capability for the exact same price?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the real world the company is still managing to find plenty of customers, I grant you that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology isn't improving by a factor of a hundred every year, the amount of information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CISCO can send down a line is only doubling every 9 months but the end is not in sight.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure but answer my point. If such a situation occured, and CISCO couldn't answer with similar
<BR>
technology at the same price, their stock would tank, right?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;I noticed you deleted my explaination for why they'd be screwed no matter how much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;they wanted to and were capable of building an aircar.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is my habit to delete as much irrelevant quoted material as I possibly can, unlike certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people I could name.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ouch John.... been taking lessons from Lee I see.
