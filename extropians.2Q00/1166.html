<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The only protection offered against illegitimate use of deadly force
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the U.S. is to kill the state agents/police at the time the incident
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;occurs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Murder is *already* a capital offense, even if you are wearing a cop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;uniform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the time you commit the murder.  So I assume what you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;suggesting is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some sort of summary execution which bypasses the jury trial process,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   That sounds like a really great plan.  Oh, except for the minor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;detail
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that *no one in their right mind would become a cop*. I'm amazed that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can hire people as cops now to get paid marginally well to risk their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;lives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every working hour of the day.  And now, in addition to getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reprimanded,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suspended, fired and sued for making an error, you think they should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *killed* too?  Yeah, sure I might take that job...if it paid $10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;million a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;No, it would make sure that cops make sure that their actions are legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;before they take them. When you are dealing with life or death issues,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;why does the life of an innocent law abiding civilian mean less than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;someone who has been condemned to death by a jury? You seem to think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that so long as the cops are doing their jobs and following orders, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;can kill whoever they want with impunity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well from James' more recent post it seems that I had *him* wrong when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggested that he was espousing summary execution for cops who did bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shootings.  He seems to understand the overarching impracticality of such an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extreme measure.  You, however, seem to think it would be a good thing.  So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I pose the question now to you - where in the world do you think you would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find people to take the job of a cop if a mistake in judgment would lead to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their summary execution?  How much do you think such brave souls would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be paid to take the job?
</EM><BR>
<P>There are many millions of law abiding citizens who carry concealed
<BR>
weapons every day (myself included), who live under the same standard
<BR>
every day. If I kill someone I beleive is committing a crime with a
<BR>
deadly weapon, why should I be held to a higher standard of behavior
<BR>
than a cop who does the same thing? Since the cop is supposedly more
<BR>
trained than I, he should be the one living up to the higher standard
<BR>
than I (why should he have more authority if he isn't more trained?). If
<BR>
I make a mistake, and kill someone, I can be held responsible, just as
<BR>
you describe. I accept that risk, because I know that there is a greater
<BR>
risk if I DONT carry that gun that someone WILL get hurt by my inability
<BR>
to either defend myself or someone else. And, I don't get paid a dime to
<BR>
take that risk.. Howz them apples?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Granted, trigger-happy cops are a bad thing.  But are cops who are afraid to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shoot until *after* they are shot at necessarily a good thing?  My guess is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that that would only lead to a sharp increase in the number of cops killed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the line of duty.  What you seem to suggest is a lose-lose situation for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cops.  If they shoot first, and they have made a mistake, they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; executed.  If they don't shoot first, chances are they are executed by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad guys.  Given that set of circumstances, if I had to choose between being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a cop and a robber...&quot;stick 'em up buddy!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>The fact is that cops are typically very poorly trained in the use of
<BR>
their guns, and in the use of deadly force. They don't practice with
<BR>
their weapons more than once a year, for their annual qualification, and
<BR>
typically their qualification scores are abysmal. Cops typically don't
<BR>
participate in civilian marksmanship competitions specifically because
<BR>
they always get embarrassed by their poor scores. Why should they care
<BR>
about being proficient? They aren't held responsible for their actions
<BR>
like we civilians are...
