Subject: Risks and Life Insurance
<BR>
<P>Someone brought to my attention that John Grigg had asked for my experience 
<BR>
(and Fred Chamberlain's) on delaying buying life insurance. I have a 
<BR>
reputation for always looking at the &quot;worst pssible side of things.&quot; As one 
<BR>
of my dialysis patients once said of me: &quot;Mike's the kind of guy that, if 
<BR>
you show him a beautiful rose, he'll immediately tell you about a guy who 
<BR>
got pricked by a thorn from the rose his girlfriend gave him on their 
<BR>
wedding day, got a horrible infection, had his arm amputated, lingered in 
<BR>
the ICU for weeks, and finally died leaving his whole family impoverished.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This not withstanding I would make the following points based on a REAL but 
<BR>
SKEWED experience in this area:
<BR>
<P>1) Mike Perry notes the odds:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;How slim? Have you checked it out?
</EM><BR>
<P>I looked on the Web just now and found a 1997 mortality table (or &quot;life 
<BR>
table&quot; as it's called. If you're interested, the URL was 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cd.gov/nds/data/lewk3_97.pdf">http://www.cd.gov/nds/data/lewk3_97.pdf</A>
<BR>
<P>I believe it pertains to the US only--a good enough start however). Starting 
<BR>
with 100,000 people at birth (age 0), there were 96,330 surviving to age 39, 
<BR>
and 93,712 surviving to age 40. The fraction dying thus is 
<BR>
(96,330-93,712)/96,330 or 2.72% or about one in 37.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Small&quot; maybe, but not what I'd call &quot;very, very small.&quot; If I had to attend 
<BR>
a lecture that 36 others were attending, and knew a terrorist would shoot 
<BR>
one of us but only one, at random, I think I'd wear a bulletproof vest. 
<BR>
There are other reasons for signing up too.
<BR>
<P>Strengthening the organization of your choice, strengthening the cryonics
<BR>
movement overall, setting an example for others, putting yourself mentally 
<BR>
in a firmer state of opposition to death, contributing to a very worthy 
<BR>
cause--all are reasons enough, and others could be found.
<BR>
These are the odds for DEATH for a 39 year old cohort. These are not
<BR>
numbers I'd be happy with: not 1 in 36!
<BR>
<P>2) These are NOT the odds for people who become uninsurable at or before
<BR>
age 39. The number of people who are, for all PRACTICAL ($$) purposes
<BR>
uninsurable by age 39 has to be much higher. In fact, I know it is and the 
<BR>
College of life Insurance in NYC can probably give you the precise numbers.
<BR>
<P>Leaving really obvious cases of uninsurability aside, there are all sorts of 
<BR>
things that can really make it very unpleasant and costly to get insurance: 
<BR>
a history of depression (depression has about the same mortality as heart 
<BR>
disease over a 5-year time course).
<BR>
Prozac isn't the big negative in getting insurance that it used to be, but 
<BR>
if you innocently tell them (or they find out in checking your medical 
<BR>
records) that you have been on 3 or 4 different antidepressants you are in 
<BR>
deep shit with a lot of the best companies.
<BR>
<P>Incidentally, FYI, it is not at all uncommon for people to have to try half 
<BR>
a dozen or more antidepressants or combinations before they find one that 
<BR>
works for them. I know people who Prozac works miracles for, but others it 
<BR>
turns into &quot;zombies.&quot; By contrast, the same class of medications (SSRIs) 
<BR>
like Paxil or Zoloft may be perfect for some, and useless or even 
<BR>
deterimental for others as individual drugs.
<BR>
<P>If you look at the number of depressed people in the US, it is staggering. 
<BR>
This will cause many companies to decline you coverage (especially if 
<BR>
something weird like cryonics is in the equation) or to &quot;rate you&quot; (charge 
<BR>
more).
<BR>
<P>3) There are LOTS of diseases like diabetes, arthritis, in fact, too many
<BR>
to mention here, that are disasters in terms of coverage and costs. These
<BR>
can hit at any time, but the older you get the greater your risk. By the
<BR>
time you are 40, judging from my chart of % of initial function left in
<BR>
various organ systems versus age (From the work of Benjamin Shock) hanging 
<BR>
on the wall next to my desk, your risk of having a serious pathology that 
<BR>
could interfere with purchase of insurance is probably rising very fast: 
<BR>
maybe exponentially.
<BR>
<P>4) Life insurance as we know it is doomed IMHO. The development of &quot;gene
<BR>
chips&quot; and soon to come CD-ROMS with THOUSANDS of possible antigens, genes, 
<BR>
biomarkers, serum enzymes, metabolites, gene products, etc. on each CD-ROM.  
<BR>
This latter technology will allow a physician to test for literally several 
<BR>
thousand things with a VERY small sample of blood using a standard CD reader 
<BR>
at a very low cost.
<BR>
<P>Even as it is, insurance companies are using increasingly sophisticated 
<BR>
assays to asess risk. People buying life insurance in the past, and to a 
<BR>
great extent today, are either overpaying or underpaying for their risk. 
<BR>
This averaging is &quot;fair&quot; as long as as you can't quantify risk very well. 
<BR>
But that is about to change. And, already, people with bad HDL/LDL ratios, 
<BR>
high homocysteine levels, certain drugs in their blood, etc,. are going to 
<BR>
find they are quietly declined coverage or quoted a very high rate.
<BR>
<P>Now, having done lifespan studies with &quot;gentetically identical&quot; animals I
<BR>
can speak from experience that they do not die all at once, or even in a
<BR>
tight &quot;squared-curve&quot; cluster. They die all over the place and from an
<BR>
amazing array of things. It *is* certainly true that they die more
<BR>
&quot;clustered&quot; and of more of the same pathologies (say a largre number of
<BR>
lymphomas for one strain versus renal failure for another) than do
<BR>
genetically heterogenous animals.
<BR>
<P>But, the stunning fact is that only about 50% of their mortality is 
<BR>
obviously gene-linked. The other 50% is chance and &quot;that which is not seen:&quot; 
<BR>
extragenetic environmental influences. Examples of chance are getting hit 
<BR>
with a cosmc ray at JUST THE RIGHT SPOT on your DNA to cause cancer, or 
<BR>
eating a peanut with an alflatoxin molcule that just happens to kinetically 
<BR>
react with your DNA at just the right time and place and cause a primary 
<BR>
hepatoma (liver cancer).
<BR>
<P>Extragenetic influences are things like womb conditions (access to placental 
<BR>
nutrition, etc.), competition for food after birth, whether you are on the 
<BR>
top of the cage rack close to the flourescent lights in the ceiling and the 
<BR>
UV they emit, or lower down and farther away frm the UV. Mice and rats at 
<BR>
the top of the rack get cataracts and skin cancers (ears, nose) at a far 
<BR>
higher rate than animals at the bottom of the rack. Thus, a GOOD lifespan 
<BR>
researcher rotates cage positions on a tight schedule to avoid these 
<BR>
effects.
<BR>
<P>I bring this up to point out that genes are NOT everything, and that
<BR>
foolish people who *do know* they are doing self-damaging things like
<BR>
smoke or drink excessively will often say things like: &quot;Both my parents
<BR>
smoked 3 packs a day since they were kids and they are still alive and well 
<BR>
at age 75.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This used to be my colleague Jerry Leaf's standard line to me: Jerry is now 
<BR>
pushing up bubbles in LN2 in Phoenix, AZ, having had an MI at age 50 which 
<BR>
resulted in sudden cardiac death (no standby and transport and lots of 
<BR>
ischemia). It's OK to smoke if you want to, but be realistic about the risks 
<BR>
and above all realize mom and and dad ain't you!  And neither are your 
<BR>
cousins or your uncles or you aunts...&quot;
<BR>
<P>So, I guess, on purely calculable bases, the odds of becoming &quot;uninsurable&quot; 
<BR>
are REALLY bad compared to dying at a given age.
<BR>
<P>5) First hand-experiences: lots in the cryonics business. It's hard to say 
<BR>
if this a skewed population or not since people who decide to sign up may 
<BR>
have a clue &quot;something isn't right.&quot; Or, more directly, they may have had 
<BR>
next of kin who died unusually early, sensitizing them to their own 
<BR>
mortality; this again might well be a marker for increased risk of death for 
<BR>
THEM, thus skewing the numbers. I can tell you that if I were to guess, 
<BR>
about 1 person in 15 who tried to sign up (age ~30) were either uninsurable 
<BR>
or had MAJOR problems finding insurance or paying for it.
<BR>
<P>6) Insurance sucks as any kind of reasonable invesment. You'd do lots
<BR>
better with the NYSE listing of stocks and a dartboard to make your
<BR>
investment selections. However, insurance DOES have these unique advantages:
<BR>
<P>a) It is almost NEVER successfully contested (Steve Bridge is incorrect, it 
<BR>
can be contested, but rarely is because the odds of success are terrible, at 
<BR>
least now, and in the historical past).
<BR>
<P>b) It is immune from asset seizure for debts and is not patrt of your
<BR>
estate, with ONE IMPORTANT EXCEPTION: the IRS or federal government can
<BR>
take your life insurance for tax liabilities or for certain drug-related
<BR>
penalties (i.e., they can argue you used money made from selling illegal
<BR>
drugs to pay the premiums and take your insurance under the seizure laws).
<BR>
<P>c) It is a quick and complication free ( in the US) way of conveying assets 
<BR>
after death, and since it was created to PROTECT FAMILY VALUES (money for 
<BR>
the widow and the semi-orphans) it enjoys specially status in this regard.
<BR>
<P>7) There is another tremendous advantage to life insurance which is sadly
<BR>
overlooked by all to many people. Let's say you &quot;win&quot; and the life
<BR>
insurance company stands to lose. Bad news, right? Well, yes, generally.
<BR>
But, with viatical settlements you now have options. Unless you are Jim
<BR>
Neighbors or Larry Hagman and you get end-stage liver disease it is going
<BR>
to cost you $250K for a liver transplant and follow up care. You will note 
<BR>
that BOTH these guys had liver transplants years ago and both are alive and 
<BR>
doing well. They HAD the $250K. Most of us don't.
<BR>
<P>Life insurance companies will cash in your policy or others will buy it for 
<BR>
a good fraction of its face value IF you are terminal (usually up to 80% of 
<BR>
face value). I know a LOT of guys who were on death's door from AIDS, cashed 
<BR>
out $500K of term and whole life (work and private coverage), traveled all 
<BR>
over, bought gobs of &quot;toys&quot; (cars, luxury condo, etc.) and then along came 
<BR>
HART therapy. They are now pumping iron (literally), have normal T cell 
<BR>
counts, undetectable viral loads, money left to pay for the meds (which are 
<BR>
not cheap), and in a few cases, money enough to invest so that they don't 
<BR>
even have to work anymore.
<BR>
<P>In any event, the ability to use life insurance for viatical purposes means 
<BR>
exapanded treatment options, money to pay for up-end cryonics services like 
<BR>
remote standby, relocate to a good hospice facility, or get better 
<BR>
end-of-life medical care. Skilled registry nurses who can pronounce death 
<BR>
cost $30.00 an hour on the cheap-side. If you don't die on schedule you 
<BR>
could rack up $5, $10, or evemn $15K in nursing bills in a few days! The 
<BR>
alternative is to wait till the hospice nurse drives out (after you are 
<BR>
dead) and pronounces you: I've had this range from 30 minutes to over an 
<BR>
hour. In the meantime you sit there with no ice, no meds, no nothing.
<BR>
<P>Finally, you don't have to cash out the whole policy, and life MATTERS NOW, 
<BR>
at least to most people. You may want to cash out $5K to take that dream 
<BR>
trip to Sri Lanka, Hawaii, or wherever. Both Mary Naples (NY Life Ins. 
<BR>
agent) and I have see friends fulfill one of their greatest dreams, like 
<BR>
that dream trip they got around to taking. I was lucky; I've always wanted 
<BR>
to go to Egypt, preferably in style and for awhile! In other words, really 
<BR>
see it all and do it all, and *not* from a tourist bus. I took the time and 
<BR>
money to do it while I still had my health. For many people that is not an 
<BR>
option.
<BR>
<P>I'm grateful that for me it was! It was a life-transforming experience that 
<BR>
was worth every penny of my hard come by savings. I spent the first morning 
<BR>
of the &quot;second millenium CE&quot; floating in a hot air balloon over the 
<BR>
Ramasseum and the Valley of the Kings in Luxox as the sun came up across the 
<BR>
Nile. I landed to a sumptuous breakfast, crossed the Nile by felucca from 
<BR>
the West (the side of death) to the East the side of life and the rising 
<BR>
sun, and spent the rest of that wonderful day listening to the soundtrack 
<BR>
from 2001: A Space Odyssey on an in-ear CD-player (immersed in the sound) 
<BR>
and viewing some of the most magnificent Egyptian sculpture still in 
<BR>
existence which is housed in the
<BR>
seemingly modest Luxor Museum and darkened, windowless Luxor Museum.
<BR>
<P>Cryonics aside, these are some of the other options that help make life
<BR>
insurance a reasonable buy despite its lousy capital return rate. There's
<BR>
more to life (and death) than price to earnings ratios....
<BR>
