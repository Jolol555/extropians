<EM>&gt; &gt; The only errors are by omission. The types of meat compared against are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; typically corn-fed farm raised sources. I've found that no matter what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; animal, raising it on corn is going to turn it into a dietary killing machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You're right, where the meat comes from can be very important for what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sort of nutritional value it will have.  Free range is so much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better...for the health, for the environment, and for the animals (if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you care about those sorts of things).
</EM><BR>
<P>As a lover of nature, I do. As a person who spends much time there (as
<BR>
opposed to an ignorant city slicker who just talks the talk and goes to
<BR>
PETA protests), I do. And, healthy animals make for healthy food. I'm
<BR>
with the OTHER PETA: People Eating Tasty Animals....

<EM>&gt; I'm vegetarian (for nearly nine years now) although I have tried going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vegan without much success. I became vegetarian for mainly ethical reasons,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but my take on the health side of things is that meat really doesn't do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything wonderful for you.  Fat content aside, meat contains no fiber,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and since the body can store only a certain amount of protein at a time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; often the excess leads to calcium being depleted.  I've seen statistics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that vegetarians do indeed live longer and are slimmer than meat-eaters.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm skeptical of any statistics, but nevertheless I have enjoyed good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; health being veggie.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't put value in being slim, and historically, slimmness has not
<BR>
been a sign of fitness or health, even dating back into pre-history.
<BR>
Anyone who thinks slimness is a virtue in and of itself has been
<BR>
programmed by one too many popular culture magazines and commercials.
<BR>
Looking at mortality stats, the fact is that thin people have a higher
<BR>
mortality than normal or slightly heavy people (though obese people do
<BR>
have the highest mortality). Get rid of your Ms. Magazines and start
<BR>
living to be happy, not to meet some social standard.
