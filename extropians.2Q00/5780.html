<P>
<EM>&gt; Keep in mind that many states that have restrictive gun laws take a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dim view of people actually defending themselves. As you stated with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some cases in Germany, there are similar cases here, where people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defended themselves in cases that would be quite justifiable in most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other states, but wound up being convicted themselves of murder or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manslaughter, or aggrevated assault. However, overall, that seems about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right. I do wonder though, since you've noted some cases where people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were victimized with nobody paying attension, what is the rate of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reportage? Could there possibly be more crimes in Germany that are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being reported?
</EM><BR>
<P>That is indeed a problem. As I know from several sources, there are
<BR>
substantial numbers of crimes which are not reported. This is especially
<BR>
true for violent crimes like assault and rape. Many crimes are not reported
<BR>
by the victims because of shame. But I suppose that this is true for many
<BR>
countries, including the US.
<BR>
<P>It is - especially when it comes to rape or child abuse - a big problem that
<BR>
the rate of crimes being reported is less than half of the total sum, in
<BR>
case of children as victims it could well be possible that only one of ten
<BR>
cases is reported. I have made the sad experience that two of my girlfriends
<BR>
were subject to sexual abuse, and the most shocking fact about it is that in
<BR>
a large part of these cases it is family (10%) or friends/neighbours (30%).
<BR>
The percentages are based on numbers given by the BKA (wich is the German
<BR>
equivalent to the FBI), but these numbers are of course only speculative.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, the laws for such crimes are way too soft for such
<BR>
people. According to my oppinion I would see to it that a criminal who has
<BR>
been charged for rape should never ever become a free man again. For me,
<BR>
rape is not less cruel than murder, and I would prefer such people far away
<BR>
from the rest of society where they can never again be a danger.
