<P>Partner, you only need to scan some of the silliness that has made
<BR>
it into the encyclopedia.  I had one from my own childhood that
<BR>
says that modern passenger airliners [photo of a DC3.  My parents
<BR>
couldnt afford a real modern encyclopedia set in the 60s] had
<BR>
wings that could withstand 30 tons per square inch. (?)   They showed
<BR>
a cartoony picture of an airplane with an inverted pyramid platform,
<BR>
the contact patch presumably one square inch, with four elephants
<BR>
standing upon it.
<BR>
<P>I now understand they were referring to the shear strength of
<BR>
the then-high tech aluminum alloys, but at the time it baffled me.
<BR>
It sure wasnt a very good way to explain the concept.
<BR>
<P>Nearly all of us owe our elementary school teachers, and hell, all
<BR>
our teachers for that matter, a thanks and an apology for not quite
<BR>
grokking what it is to live on a teachers salary, and for putting up
<BR>
with our adolescent shit.  Thanks teachers, even those who were
<BR>
occasionally full of baloney.
