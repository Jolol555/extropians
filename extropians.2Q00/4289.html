One shoddy peculiarity of using a remote Net-Hub for sending
<BR>
email is that the spell check doesn't work and also the formatting
<BR>
is a bit discombobulated.  I know I'm going to hear from Damien
<BR>
Broderick about my typos in my last post -- (his marvelous writing
<BR>
talents helped to fine-tune my book, as his editorial expertise
<BR>
had me working night and day to complete it after his review).
<BR>
&nbsp;Anyway, I'll try again:

&nbsp;------------------ 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;There ARE some good things about the multi-track pattern of
</EM><BR>
the last two Foresight SA gatherings.  The small groups allow
<BR>
better opportunities for interaction and insure that there is
<BR>
always something interesting going on 
<BR>
for everyone.&lt;
<BR>
<P>Sorry I missed it this year.  My experience last year was educational.
<BR>
<P>First, I appreciated the challenging approach that Foresight
<BR>
set up for the gathering.  I found it visually appealing re:
<BR>
the large board display where ideas and sessions kept &quot;evolving&quot;
<BR>
and attendees could pick and choose how much data they wanted
<BR>
to take in for the weekend, with whom they wanted to learn, and
<BR>
with whom they wanted to nanoschmooze (as Chris says).  
<BR>
<P>Second, I enjoyed designing and leading a session.  From this
<BR>
perspective, the gathering was instructional because I had to
<BR>
deal with (a) how to get people to the session --whether or not
<BR>
my session would be full or if it would be a no show; and (b)how
<BR>
to keep participants focused and interested while much noise
<BR>
and movement was occurring around the session.  
<BR>
<P>Overall for most sessions, peripheral factors such as lack of
<BR>
acoustics and physical partitions caused interference but in
<BR>
the overall scheme, they were minor.  The major interference
<BR>
was larger sessions scooping up participants from smaller sessions
<BR>
because of better seating arrangements, vocal power, or person
<BR>
power.  In otherwords, I noticed that participants (such as myself)
<BR>
who might change sessions mid-point pending on popularity of
<BR>
session as well as content.  Now, this isn't necessarily a bad
<BR>
thing.  In fact, it creates a fluid and mobile environment (similar
<BR>
to the cocktail party vision that Robin mentioned previously).
<BR>
&nbsp;The downside for people (like me) is that I want to know what
<BR>
is happening in other sessions!  
<BR>
<P>Problems occur when there is an imbalance with context and intent.
<BR>
&nbsp;If a conference is designed to function like the leaning Tower
<BR>
of Pisa, it needs to have some stabilizing turf to hold it upright.
<BR>
<P>&lt;I can envision trying to get the best of both kinds of conference.
<BR>
&nbsp;Perhaps a traditional auditorium for single-speaker/panels with
<BR>
large-group audiences, coupled with a separate, nearby area in
<BR>
which &quot;nodes&quot; could be
<BR>
set-up for ad-hoc discussions.  The nodes MIGHT be labeled for
<BR>
use by people interested in particular subjects.  These node
<BR>
areas would have comfortable chairs, places to put up posters,
<BR>
whiteboards, etc.&gt; 
<BR>
<P>&lt;A &quot;conference architecture&quot; might be built around having only
<BR>
two large-group presentations per day, and the rest of the time
<BR>
could be reserved for ad-hoc discussions around the &quot;nodes&quot;.&gt;
<BR>
<P>This is similar to the architecture Max is working on and Extro
<BR>
5, will be different than the conferences we have had in the
<BR>
past.  This is a good thing.  
<BR>
<P>Natasha
<BR>
<P>&quot;The best defense?  Make ideas happen.&quot;
