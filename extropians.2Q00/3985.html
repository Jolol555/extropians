<EM>&gt; It is about a student project to grow potatoes in (simulated) Martian soil.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is this possible? This is very startling to me. I was under the impression
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you need some sort of organic material in the soil to grow any kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plant, and surely they will need to at least add water.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What exactly are the soil requirements for growing various types of plants?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could you grow food plants in the dust which coats the moon? If so, this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drastically simplifies my lunar colonization plans.

<EM>&gt;

<P>There are plants which grow in desert sand, and plants which grow on
<BR>
pure rock. Many plants depend upon heavily organic soil, because most
<BR>
plants have evolved in such soil, however there are many that can be
<BR>
grown hydroponically, i.e. with no soil at all. References to 'organic'
<BR>
material do not necessarily refer to rotting plant material or
<BR>
microorganisms. Such references refer to the use of organic (i.e. carbon
<BR>
chemistry) compounds dissolved in water. Most current Martian
<BR>
terraforming plans involve the development of extremophilic lichens and
<BR>
microorganisms to begin the process of slowly converting the soil.
<BR>
<P>Lunar soil brought back to earth has been used in growing experiments,
<BR>
but you could not grow anything on the moon, as it is a vacuum, no
<BR>
atmosphere. The moon is not large enough to hold a decent enough
<BR>
atmosphere to support life, and any atmosphere that may be developed
<BR>
will quickly be evaporated away into space, through solar radiation and
<BR>
terran tidal influence. Any agriculture on the moon will have to be
<BR>
indoors.
