<P><EM>&gt; Hmmm now Im more curious than ever.  Composites wouldnt be any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  good for that purpose and I dont know of any materials breakthrus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  in the past several years in metals, unless they are using one of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  new tricky sintering technologies.  But I wouldnt think that would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  any good for a part as big as a rocker arm or a pushrod.  Curious.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wasn't necessarily think new materials, per se.  for instance, we're seeing 
<BR>
&nbsp;a lot more titanium stuff in things like racing engines, because the tech 
<BR>
for working with it has gotten better.  But I was just guessing there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt;  The benefits of getting rid of a long timing belt or chain, with all 
</EM><BR>
the 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; lash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; problems and tension-maintenance issues they give rise to, may offset the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; reciprocating mass cost of the pushrods.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Ja, but I would think the answer to timing chain lash is a direct shaft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  drive with bevel gears for the overhead cam shafts.  That system is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  still reasonably light, reliable and very durable under high revs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I'll reveal my ignorance: I've never heard of a shaft-driven ohc 
<BR>
system.  Are there such in production????  I thought they were all belt- or 
<BR>
chain-driven.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I notice the motorcycle world going back to push rods, which shocks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  me, but I assumed the reason was to imitate Harley Davidson.  Have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  you seen the Japanese Harley clones?  Yamaha is building one that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  so Harley-like you need to be right next to it to tell the difference:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  pushrod, fat bob tank, softtail-like back-end, air cooled 98 CI Vtwin,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  even a belt final drive.  They must stopped.  I want one.  {8^D  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh oh.  We've now identified an unbridgeable gap between us, Spike old man.  
<BR>
Back in my biker days, I decided there were three kinds of bikes and three 
<BR>
kinds of bikers: &quot;Profilers&quot; (Harley-style, low-cut seats, long rake-angles), 
<BR>
&quot;Cafes&quot; (tucked-in, racer-style) and &quot;In-betweens&quot; (classic &quot;straight&quot; sport 
<BR>
bikes and touring bikes).  Although for practical reasons my wheels were 
<BR>
always of the latter category (since during most of that time a bike was my 
<BR>
only wheels), my heart was in the middle category.  Had I not gotten out of 
<BR>
bikes, I'd be driving a &quot;katana&quot;-style bike today. I always considered 
<BR>
Profilers to be ill-considered pieces of &quot;street jewelry&quot;, designed to look 
<BR>
good from the side but having evil handling manners, mainly due to the 
<BR>
rider's constricted position and the overly-long wheelbase.
