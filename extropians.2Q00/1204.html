Hi Brad,
<BR>
<P>Yes I agree about the singularity stuff which seems on the same (negative)
<BR>
level as 1st Century and latter-day religio-apocalyptists. I am moderately
<BR>
interested in the I Ching, and am working on correspondences between it &amp;
<BR>
the E/ Chess squares, and Acupuncture.
<BR>
<P>There have been some quite emotive postings on other lists about TM, who
<BR>
seems to be undergoing the usual reappraisal following his demise.
<BR>
<P>Although I am a radical futurist (posthumans take that extra step forward
<BR>
from transhuman), I sometimes find ancient, tried and true systems to be
<BR>
more effective than modern 'magic bullets' that come and go, and are
<BR>
announced regularly on this list. We don't want to be slaves to fashions in
<BR>
futurism when our interests might be better served by medicine systems with
<BR>
very long-term case histories (eg .acu-systems &amp; mesmerism/ hypnosis).
<BR>
<P>Best,
<BR>
S. www.steve-nichols.com

<P>Hello All
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the Terrence McKenna (TM) obituary (although in my opinion its
<BR>
characterization leans a little too heavily towards the classic Tim Leary
<BR>
bio). I happen to believe TM's time-wave novelty model for predicting a
<BR>
singularity was a somewhat flaky corner of an otherwise brilliant campaign
<BR>
to empower everyday people to 'pull back the curtain and see the Wizard for
<BR>
themselves', so to speak.
<BR>
<P>Although I am not a big fan of TM's decreasing novelty / I Ching hybrid
<BR>
model, I am increasingly convinced that the point at which disincarnate
<BR>
intelligence supersedes its developers in a meaningful way (ie. Vernon Vinge
<BR>
theory)may, in fact, fall within a relatively small band around TM's date of
<BR>
cataclysm (Dec 22 2012. 'Small band' loosely defined could be 0 - 50 years.
<BR>
Anyone familiar with TM's writing care to convince me that this is could be
<BR>
more than mere coincidence and that TM's model isn't just post hoc
<BR>
application of formalized procedure onto an pre-existing ontological
<BR>
phenomena?
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Brad
