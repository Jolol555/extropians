re:&quot;Red is no longer real red&quot;
<BR>
<P>We have the objective measure of red in wavelength,
<BR>
we have the subjective observation of red, and that has never been &quot;real&quot; 
<BR>
red, just ask your cat what red and blue are from its perspective.
<BR>
<P>Consider the data glut many of us are experiencing may create a relevancy 
<BR>
crisis, and the brain IS adapting by filtering extraneous data via reticular 
<BR>
activating mechanism ?
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;Coyote&quot;
<BR>
&quot;All things appear and disappear because of the concurrence of causes and 
<BR>
conditions. Nothing ever exists entirely alone; everything is in relation to 
<BR>
everything else.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>--------
<BR>
The article by Casey Walker in Feed magazine has left me a bit perplexed.
<BR>
I'm not quite dubious, but I certainly would appreciate more information
<BR>
from someone(s) on the list.   Can anyone explain if the following
<BR>
statements are valid and if so, how much and what type of research has been
<BR>
performed?
<BR>
<P>Specific statements that caught my eye:
<BR>
<P><P>1.  &quot;... senses of smell, taste, touch, sight and hearing have decreased at
<BR>
a rate of nearly one percent per year.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I agree that we may use our senses less than we did in the jungles,
<BR>
I'm not entirely sure that we have eliminated the capacity.  We do know
<BR>
that people who listen to loud music (usually rock music) have a decreased
<BR>
auditory sense, but I'm not sure that this applies to everyone.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement also does not take into account specific sensory
<BR>
augmentations and prosthetics that have increased individual's sensory
<BR>
abilities.
<BR>
<P>2.	&quot;Our brain is not adapting.&quot;
<BR>
<P>3.	&quot;Red is no longer real red.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><P>This extract is taken from the heading &quot;Thresholds of the Biological&quot; (page
<BR>
7 or 8).
<BR>
<P>&quot;Recent studies out of Germany -- from Tuebingen University and
<BR>
Gesellschaft fur Rationelle Psychologie in Munich -- show that our
<BR>
contemporary environments have, in fact, already changed our biology. In
<BR>
the last twenty years, from repeated testings of four thousand
<BR>
participants, the senses of smell, taste, touch, sight, and hearing have
<BR>
decreased at a rate of nearly one percent per year. &quot;15 years ago, Germans
<BR>
could distinguish 300,000 sounds. Today, on average, they only make it to
<BR>
180,000. Many children stagnate at 100,000. That is enough for hip hop and
<BR>
rap music, but it is insufficient for the subtleties of a classical
<BR>
symphony.&quot; And, GRP studies showed &quot;generation gaps&quot; between brains formed
<BR>
before 1948, brains formed between 1948 and 1968, and brains formed since.
<BR>
The newer the brain, the more &quot;dissonance&quot; it can tolerate. New brains
<BR>
accomodate floods of contradictory information as data without, apparently,
<BR>
fighting the crush of time for synthesis -- a neurological process
<BR>
amounting, in the researchers view, to a loss in what the brain can bring
<BR>
to consciousness. Data shows that the unconscious has risen from
<BR>
eighty-seven percent of total brain processing to ninety-four percent. Dr.
<BR>
Henner Ertel says, &quot;We are seeing the largest and fastest breakthrough
<BR>
since the dawn of consciousness. Our brain is not adapting. It is rebelling
<BR>
against the world and changing it [the world] by changing itself. Red is no
<BR>
longer red. Sweet smells begin to stink. In the next century, different
<BR>
people will be living in a new world.&quot;
