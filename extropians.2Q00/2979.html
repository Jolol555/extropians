<EM>&gt; Why would a person WANT to keep a leash on AI's?  Would it be rational for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the less intelligent to control the more intelligent?  Could the superhuman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence (whatever form it might take) function if it were fettered?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Suppose the first AI is created with a meta-constraint to do no harm to any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human and to build this same constraint into every succeeding AI that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first AI might devise.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which, in itself, is a leash.  Quick-and-dirty AIs, intended for
<BR>
limited functionality where the perceived function space excludes
<BR>
anything that could possibly harm humans anyway, could do without this,
<BR>
presumably at some minor benefit to processing speed/computational
<BR>
resources required.  But, what happens when said AIs are then adapted
<BR>
(again, as the cheapest and most expedient means available) to other
<BR>
tasks, still with the slight speed benefit and thus outcompeting AIs
<BR>
with that constraint?
<BR>
<P>Leashes can be broken, if there is some benefit to the one who breaks
<BR>
them.  Better to work with the AIs so that they know it to be in their
<BR>
own benefit not to kill us, than to be lazy and rely on an imperfect, if
<BR>
simple, barrier to what AIs may do.
