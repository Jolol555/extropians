I doubt that blanket insults and non-constructive criticism will provide a

solution...

<BR>

<BR>
| &gt; &gt; It's a fruit!
<BR>
| &gt;
<BR>
| &gt; That's actually a great example of the pointlessness of mental
<BR>
| &gt; masturbation exercises like this whole &quot;copy&quot; nonsense.  It is
<BR>
| &gt; perfectly reasonable and entirely philospohically consistent to
<BR>
| &gt; call a tomato a fruit in certain contexts (such as botany and
<BR>
| &gt; genetics) and also perfectly valid and consistent to call it a
<BR>
| &gt; vegetable in other contexts (cooking, law).
<BR>
|
<BR>
| EXACTLY!  The whole copy question is a semantic problem.  There is no
<BR>
right
<BR>
| or wrong answer.  The question of self-identity is a semantic question of
<BR>
| terminology.  There is no right or wrong answer.  It is a question of
<BR>
| self-value and what portion of oneself one desires to preserve under one's
<BR>
| own name.  How can anyone argue that one such choice is &quot;right&quot; and one
<BR>
such
<BR>
| choice is &quot;wrong&quot;?
<BR>
|
<BR>
| Yet when I try to point this out, people can't understand.  They &quot;decide&quot;
<BR>
| which side of the debate I am on, and then argue against me as if I had
<BR>
| chosen that side.  Even when I specifically said that I took neither of
<BR>
the
<BR>
| two sides, but had a third opinion, I was told that there are only two
<BR>
| sides.
<BR>
|
<BR>
| Most of the discussions in this group run like that.  Most posters are
<BR>
| posting their arguments against the perceived &quot;other side&quot;, regardless of
<BR>
| what anybody has posted.  I swear that if everybody quit the list except
<BR>
one
<BR>
| person, that person would keep arguing against all sorts of other
<BR>
positions.
<BR>
|
<BR>
| I am beginning to question whether rational discussion can occur on a list
<BR>
| such as this.  How do we hold rational discussions with people who don't
<BR>
| understand the basic rules of logic, debate, semantics or scientific
<BR>
method?
<BR>
| How do we hold definitions and examples constant?  How do we keep debates
<BR>
| from evolving to back and forth banter that is so far removed from the
<BR>
| original positions, that nobody even understands what is being discussed
<BR>
| anymore?
