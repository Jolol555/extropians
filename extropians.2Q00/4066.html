<P>&quot;I wonder what would happen if you organized a 'party/poster'
<BR>
conference by just having a very large room with dozens of whiteboards,
<BR>
and with snacks and chairs distributed throughout.  There would
<BR>
be no official schedule or map, and you'd spend the whole weekend
<BR>
wandering about joining whatever discussions or presentations
<BR>
formed &quot;spontaneously.&quot;  Any dispute about what a group talked
<BR>
about in a location would be handled as at a party, with the
<BR>
option of one group walking away to do what they want somewhere
<BR>
else.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I like this spin on creative brain-storming. In most, criticism
<BR>
is not permitted or interrupting a person's expression. Every
<BR>
idea, no matter how frivolous is accepted because these ideas
<BR>
tend to trigger best solutions.  In your design, the rules, in
<BR>
this regards, would be social skills and common sense, which
<BR>
would include not interrupting or censoring inappropriately.
<BR>
<P>We performed a type of creativity session at university where
<BR>
we had butcher paper on all walls of the room and students were
<BR>
given total imagination-stretch to do with the white whatever
<BR>
they wanted.  Usually, a person needs some sort of direction,
<BR>
or theme for the process to get motivated.  This is different
<BR>
than bringing a type of creative thinker into a room with a specific
<BR>
scenario to build on, and giving total freedom to create and
<BR>
exchange ideas.  Considering this, I might participate differently
<BR>
if I was with you (Robin), Max, Greg, Amara, and Eli than I would
<BR>
E. Shaun, Fiorella Terenze, Stelarc, Nadia and Francis Ford Copola.
<BR>
&nbsp;But then again, maybe not. Both groups are comprised of individuals
<BR>
whose creativity crosses disciplinary boundaries.  Much of the
<BR>
outcome depends on the dynamics of the group and communication
<BR>
abilitiese.  
<BR>
<P>I like your &quot;party&quot; analogy -:) (I'm visualizing several people
<BR>
at a coctail party sipping on their drinks moving in groups (of
<BR>
one or more) to and fro from other groups - depending on whether
<BR>
the conversation is intriguing or a bore.)  I don't think, however,
<BR>
that I would want to mix a party with a task.  I would, however,
<BR>
mix a party scene with a performance art piece which would involve
<BR>
all participants in a task; or create a task session in a party-like
<BR>
atmosphere as long as everyone knew.
<BR>
<P>Eliezer:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;This is an excellent idea and should, at the very least, &gt;be
</EM><BR>
tried as a 2-hour across-the-board &quot;panel&quot; at the next &gt;Foresight
<BR>
conference.
<BR>
<P>Could you explain?  Thanks.
