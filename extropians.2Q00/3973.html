</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I suppose I can see how her ideas on &quot;egoism&quot; might lead an others-centered 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  person (such as, apparently, yourself) to view her ideas this way. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I did not say I was others centered. That's preposterous. I said I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was a person who loved. I love myself. I love things passionately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ... thing outside myself: my lover, my family, my smallest closest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circle of friends, new people, things, animals, genres of art,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; music, TV, books, conversation, this list...
</EM><BR>
<P>It should be noted that Rand in particular uses a lot of terms in a
<BR>
different way from...  Well, anybody else really.  (This is almost
<BR>
certainly a bad practice.  I am not a Randian.)
<BR>
<P>A consistent egoist can still love others; you may notice that many
<BR>
characters in Rand's books fall in love, even risk their own lives to
<BR>
save others.
<BR>
<P>The difference here lies in the emphasis.  If you think that you OUGHT
<BR>
to love others, on account of a moral obligation to Love, an egoist
<BR>
must disagree.  If you just happen to love others and act on that
<BR>
inclination, no egoist has room to criticize you.
<BR>
<P>(Though they may be doubtful and/or skeptical that you don't *really*
<BR>
love others as you say...  all too many people these days are told
<BR>
that they ought to love others as themselves, and therefore claim to
<BR>
do so, even while harboring extreme resentment, or even
<BR>
self-loathing.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; IMO we are all born self centered. This is normal, but hopefully we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learn to curb that impulse when we learn the rest of the world is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interactive. Being a grabby child at 35 is OK BY ME ... but OFTEN it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't serve the situation, or infringes on other's boundaries or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; causes pain to others.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I don't think anybody is arguing that you are morally obligated
<BR>
to be &quot;grabby.&quot;  No one's arguing that the act of helping others while
<BR>
suffering material disadvantage or material risk is wrong.  Rand's
<BR>
good characters DO that.  Nor is it unacceptable to love others.  Her
<BR>
good characters do THAT, too.
<BR>
<P>Again, your reading of Rand is understandable, given the words she
<BR>
uses to describe her philosophy and the overtones which our society
<BR>
puts on the terms &quot;selfish&quot; and &quot;egoism.&quot;  It's often useful to
<BR>
differentiate between &quot;egoism&quot; and &quot;egotism,&quot; the latter being a
<BR>
special case of the former.  The egotist has no inclinations to aid
<BR>
others, no desire to suffer material disadvantage for the benefit of
<BR>
loved ones.  The egotist is a &quot;grabby child.&quot;  The egotist has no
<BR>
&quot;loved ones.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The egoist, on the other hand, is simply commited to only acting on
<BR>
those principles which they actually believe in, to love only when
<BR>
they actually feel love for another, rather than out of supposed moral
<BR>
obligation.  (You become an objectivist when you add that the
<BR>
principles which we believe in are necessarily right, though we
<BR>
believe in the right principles only contingently.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The character in the Fountainhead would NEVER have been a follower of dogma 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's the funny part. Howard Roarke at an objectivists gathering?? bahaha 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gimme a break.
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends on what they were there for.  If it was an organization of
<BR>
objectivists sitting around planning something interesting, I think
<BR>
he'd be there.  Would he show up to any old &quot;yay Rand&quot; party?  I
<BR>
would expect not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A healthy person does not need to be told to be more selfish, it comes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; naturally to love one's self and to have integrity to one's own ego. A 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; healthy person also doesn't need THAT much control over others -- or need to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smugly put-down those who haven't learned to take care of themselves, and to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; build themselves up with bogus pomposity and leering condescension for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone else.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the second main point I want to criticize.  I disagree with
<BR>
your assertion that she dislikes the masses.  She believes that, deep
<BR>
down inside, we all realize that each of us can only be motivated by
<BR>
those desires and beliefs which are valid to each.  She thinks that we
<BR>
know that egoism is right (not that egotism is right), but most of us
<BR>
have been misled or forced into submission.  You may disagree with
<BR>
that, but that claim is what (she thinks) justifies her in saying that
<BR>
most of us ARE good, especially the masses.  [Think of Plato teaching
<BR>
the boy how to double a circle by asking the boy questions...  Thus,
<BR>
he concludes, the boy must have already KNOWN the answer]
<BR>
<P>You will see condescension towards people who actively disagree with
<BR>
her.  For example, I bet she'd just assume that you &quot;love&quot; others
<BR>
because you've been taught to do so, rather than out of genuine love,
<BR>
which comes from your own heart.  (Your OWN heart.)  I know too many
<BR>
people who hate themselves and love others.  I'm sure she'd be
<BR>
condescending towards you if she thought you were like that.
<BR>
<P>BUT she is also fundamentally hopeful about mankind.  She thinks that
<BR>
most of us ARE good, even if the bad ones are really bad.  It that
<BR>
respect, the masses are good.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; TO ME it always boils down to the fact that selfish-self absorbed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people are often &quot;rigid and lacking in experience&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here, I think, you're right, in saying that she's rigid, but wrong in
<BR>
arguing that this has to do with her being self absorbed.  Rand isn't
<BR>
as respectful as she could be towards those who disagree with her.
<BR>
Part of this has to do with her commitment to the objectivity of her
<BR>
beliefs, but largely, this is just a fact about Rand.  It's not only
<BR>
possible to be fully committed to one's own beliefs while remaining
<BR>
respectful of others, but it's certain to make you more effective at
<BR>
rhetoric.  In THAT respect, she is rigid... one can only assume it has
<BR>
to do with a lack of worldliness.
<BR>
<P>The mistake, however, is to think that this rigidity has to do with
<BR>
her selfishness or her being self-absorbed.  It's easy to assume that
<BR>
Rand has elevated her OWN beliefs, as such, to &quot;objective&quot; status; to
<BR>
assume that Rand says that &quot;Rand is right.&quot;  However, Rand's position
<BR>
is that she happens to be right, not that *whatever* she thinks is
<BR>
right.  The difference is subtle, but extremely important.  The latter
<BR>
is a statement of ignoring all positions which aren't your own.  The
<BR>
former is the wholehearted embracement of a position that &quot;belongs&quot; to
<BR>
no one, which may be open minded (though, coincidentally, Rand
<BR>
probably isn't).
<BR>
<P>If you hold a more subjectivist view about the relationship between
<BR>
our beliefs and reality, you might think that this is impossible.  You
<BR>
might think that people who make religious claims are merely promoting
<BR>
&quot;their&quot; beliefs over the beliefs of others, that realist scientists
<BR>
prioritize their own conceptual scheme at the neglect of everyone
<BR>
else's, that claims of objectivity are simply claims of &quot;I'm right,
<BR>
you're wrong.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Even if you insist that this IS what's going on, you should at least see
<BR>
how a good, honest, and most of all open-minded person would hold the
<BR>
opposite view: Rand, for example, would hold that a particular view is
<BR>
right, regardless of what she, or anyone else, thinks about it.  She
<BR>
would hold that if she changed her mind, she would become wrong,
<BR>
and that if she had an open mind, she would soon switch back to her
<BR>
original position.  Compare this to the feudal view that the King
<BR>
makes the law; that if His Majesty changes his mind, then the truth
<BR>
sways with the King.  Or compare it with certain brands of sollipcism,
<BR>
where, again, the self decides on what the world will be like.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How can you be UTTERLY focused on yourself 100% of the time and find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the time to look openly at life outside your own sphere? To be open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minded? Listen?  Especially since people are ALWAYS contradicting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you, challenging your ideas, disagreeing?
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends on what you're looking for.  People usually disagree with
<BR>
me when we argue, but we usually don't argue.  So people don't usually
<BR>
disagree with me.
