<EM>&gt; You don't get out much, and you certainly haven't checked the job
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market lately.  What do you think those 6-figure Java programmers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are building, toys?  No, their building server-side distributed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enterprize applications--the kind of software no one sees on any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shelf, but that runs everything behind the scenes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I thought all those six-figure Java programmers were working on
<BR>
projects that haven't gotten out the door yet - and given the failure rate
<BR>
for adventuresome new programming projects, something like 80% of them never
<BR>
will. This is as opposed to the six-figure COM programmers (like me) who've
<BR>
actually seen several major projects through to production at this point.
<BR>
<P>Mind you, what I actually meant to refer to was Enterprise JavaBeans, not
<BR>
Java in general. I know there are starting to be some straight Java apps out
<BR>
there, although I haven't had the need to actually interface with one yet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Implying that Java is a &quot;closed&quot; system is about 170 degrees from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the truth.  Not quite 180, because Sun does retain the right to pass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; final judgment over the &quot;official&quot; status of new APIs, and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retain a trademark on the name.  But the Java platform itself is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 100% public specification with no restrictions of any kind on its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementation or extension, with 100% freely available and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; redistributable reference implementations from Sun, 100% freely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available source code from Sun, and 100% freely available and freely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; redistributable source code from several other vendors.  Anyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calls that &quot;closed&quot; has an agenda other than the truth.
</EM><BR>
<P>Once again, I actually meant to say EJB. There are two important senses in
<BR>
which EJB is a completely closed system from my perspective:
<BR>
<P>1) EJB has no provision for communicating with other software architectures
<BR>
(aside from a token CORBA bridge that I'm told is essentially vaporware),
<BR>
and Sun apparently has no interest in changing that. If you want to connect
<BR>
EJB with a system based on someone else's technology (be it componentware,
<BR>
TPMs or message queues) you have to go hunting for outside vendors with an
<BR>
appropriate bridge, which quickly becomes very expensive and very messy to
<BR>
deal with.
<BR>
<P>2) EJB requires everything to be written in Java. A language-neutral
<BR>
standard would have been much more useful, since most of the world doesn't
<BR>
speak Java and isn't going to anytime soon. Switching to a distributed
<BR>
application architecture is hard enough without having to switch languages
<BR>
at the same time.
<BR>
<P>In other words, Java's 'openness' is entirely focused on portability (which
<BR>
most people don't need), while interoperability (which everyone needs) is
<BR>
given very little attention.
<BR>
<P>Now, I don't know all that much about Java (as opposed to EJB), but what I
<BR>
have heard doesn't sound nearly as free-wheeling as what you describe. Don't
<BR>
vendors need Sun's stamp of approval to call their products &quot;Java&quot;? They
<BR>
certainly do to advertise them as an &quot;Enterprise JavaBeans&quot; implementation.
<BR>
And if the standard is freely extensible, how did Microsoft get sued for
<BR>
writing their own extensions?
<BR>
<P>My impression is that Sun retains the right to say who can sell Java
<BR>
implementations and what features they can include, and uses this to make
<BR>
sure no one does anything they don't approve of with the standard. While
<BR>
this is a perfectly reasonable business practice, it does make their claims
<BR>
to openness a bit dubious - they are only open to innovations that don't
<BR>
hurt their own market position, which puts them in the same category as any
<BR>
well-run proprietary standard.
