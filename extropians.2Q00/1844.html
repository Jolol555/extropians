<EM>&gt;&gt; Microsoft's current performance in both these areas is in the top 25% of
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; industry, and still improving at a steady rate. They aren't the best in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; world, but they are much better than average, and unless the Unix vendors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; get their collective act together they *will* be the best in another five
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; years or so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...by virtue of having bought up or run out of business all competition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that did have their act together.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I had a byte for every time I heard this sentiment, my hard-drive would
<BR>
be full.  What is unfair about &quot;buying up competition?&quot;  The competition
<BR>
has the choice of either selling its business --usually at a profit-- to
<BR>
the larger company, or finding a way to remain successful as competition.
<BR>
Simple.  No one's rights are being abused, it is simply a case of: may the
<BR>
best business win.  Bill Gates has done what every entrepreneur dreams of:
<BR>
created a series of extremely successful products which have changed the
<BR>
face of the marketplace in such a way that competition is hard sought.  He
<BR>
has been successful, and made a lot of money.  He started his company, he
<BR>
has shaped his company's direction, and now he is being condemned for that
<BR>
success because his competition is too inept to follow suit.
<BR>
<P>The idea that a monopoly is *always bad* is absurd.  Microsoft products are
<BR>
reasonably priced and easy to use.  Linux is free and somewhat easy to use,
<BR>
but its creators have not been able to market it as well as Microsoft --is
<BR>
that Microsoft's fault?  According to the sentiment of the ruling, it is.
<BR>
<P>Look at the same scenario on a smaller level:  In Orangetown, U.S.A., there
<BR>
were a whole host of orange groves competing with each other.  For many
<BR>
years each grove made approximately the same revenue, and sold oranges
<BR>
which were arguably not all that different from each other.  One day, a
<BR>
young man moved into Orangetown and realized that the market was stagnant.
<BR>
As a result, he opened up an apple orchard.  The buying public of
<BR>
Orangetown was shocked at this new commodity on the market, and began
<BR>
buying just as many apples as oranges.  With the growing revenue from the
<BR>
apple demands, the young man was able to invest in new ways of growing and
<BR>
distributing his product.  Many orange groves declared bankruptcy due to
<BR>
their inability to adapt to the market, while other groves began
<BR>
experimenting with apples.  After a few years of being very successful, the
<BR>
young man was able to buy out any of the orchards which had new
<BR>
distribution and growth ideas; the competition was more than happy to sell,
<BR>
as competing with the young man was very tough.  The end.
<BR>
<P>Ultimately, a market is determined by consumers.  Given the revenue of
<BR>
Microsoft prior to November, consumers obviously weren't too upset by any
<BR>
of Microsoft's practices...the products were still being bought, and few
<BR>
were complaining.  But now, the government has to step in to protect all
<BR>
the weak competitors.  Suddenly, the market drops, and everyone stands
<BR>
around scratching his or her head wondering why.
