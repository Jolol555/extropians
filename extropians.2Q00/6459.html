<BR>
<P>Wow, Brent. That's pretty intense. I needed some time to digest that.
<BR>
<P>There are just a couple of problems. 
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First
<BR>
<P>The nurturing environment from youth onward approach means that you'll
<BR>
have a lot of people accepting the Extropian Church on faith rather
<BR>
than coming to it through reason. I could be wrong on this, though. If
<BR>
any indoctrination is to be done, it will have to be into critical
<BR>
thinking, and then let the kid make up their own mind. Let them
<BR>
independently come to the same conclusions we have. Or not.
<BR>
<P>We can't afford to have people out there claiming to be proponents of
<BR>
rationality, who have their own rational faculties compromised by 
<BR>
indoctrination. 
<BR>
<P>Also, the temptation to exercise power, to manipulate would be too
<BR>
great. Cf. Scientology.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second
<BR>
<P>We've already been through the Science as Savior phase.  It was the
<BR>
Enlightenment and the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. People
<BR>
who believed many of the things we do were the *dominated* intellectual
<BR>
discourse in Europe and America. We're still living down the backlash
<BR>
against science and reason. Why?
<BR>
<P>Because, unlike God, science delivers measurable results. Results that
<BR>
can be measurably disappointing. When the public builds these steam and
<BR>
steel (or DNA and diamond) castles in the sky, and is then disappointed,
<BR>
it swings in the other direction. Hence the communist revolutions at 
<BR>
the beginning of this century, the youth unrest of the 60's, and today's
<BR>
greens. Cautious optimism is too subtle for most people. It's certainly
<BR>
too subtle for me and my wishful thinking, gambling-on-an-IPO ways often
<BR>
times.  
<BR>
<P><P>So, we can't go wrong attempting to spread the benefits of transhuman
<BR>
technologies to as many people as possible. We can't go wrong being kind
<BR>
and generous without God or Caesar breathing down our necks. Especially
<BR>
if we're kind and generous in a way that bolsters self-reliance and
<BR>
self-sufficiency instead of encouraging dependence.
<BR>
<P>However, we can EASILY go wrong by taking that final step and turning
<BR>
it into a religion. Which is not to say that I don't have certain
<BR>
sympathetic attitudes toward what religion *could* be.
<BR>
<P>Religion could be a constructive force. Religion could be something 
<BR>
that's indifferent or maybe even cautiously supportive of progress
<BR>
instead of an obstacle to it. Religion can be a form of psychotherapy.
<BR>
And there is no need to reinvent the wheel here. Existing religions
<BR>
can be reformed. *** There is a common ground to be found between
<BR>
religion and atheism, which can benefit both ***
<BR>
<P>How can this be done? I might have a plan, but that's the subject of a
<BR>
later post. Let's just say that there's a common theme to the changes
<BR>
sweeping through business, law, technology, and culture. So far,
<BR>
religion hasn't really started feeling this paradigm shift.
<BR>
<P>PS: Brent, would you have any interest in us writing up these letters
<BR>
as a point-counterpoint feature for the new &gt;H site (I'm not sure
<BR>
whether or not it's polite to advertize non ExI URLs on here, so I
<BR>
won't)?
