<EM>&gt; Regarding cosmology it has been said...

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And here is a third article I think you might find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting - note especially :
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;The best explanation for the observations requires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that over large distances gravity becomes a repulsive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; force, not an attractive one.&quot; '
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now's my chance to ask a question.......(betraying immense ignorance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nodoubt...but what the heck)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is it just me?......or are the conclusions drawn of Plasma Cosmology (Alfven
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; et al.) as portrayed in &quot;The Big Bang Never Happened&quot; (by Lerner) gainin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more credibility?  It would seem to me that the data presented earlier in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this thread would be equaly well explained by a universe infinite both in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time and in space...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I dunno about the repulsive gravity though....
</EM><BR>
<P>Its pretty well accepted that the big bang happened. As far as I have
<BR>
heard, the macro repulsive force is separate from gravity, and is
<BR>
something to do with the remaining large amount of cosmic strings woven
<BR>
through the universe. Perhaps some can give more detail, but IMHO,
<BR>
people who try to claim the big bang never happened are as zealously
<BR>
dogmatic in proving a negative due to their fanatic atheism as anyone
<BR>
who still claims the earth was created in 4004 BC.
