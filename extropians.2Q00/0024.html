<P>
Sean,
<BR>
<P>I just want to say publicly how sorry I am about the loss of your dad, 
<BR>
Anthony Kenny.  Fifty-eight is so young to die nowadays, so it must have 
<BR>
come as a totally unexpected event.  It sounds like you were blessed with a 
<BR>
father who really loved you and gave alot of himself.  As someone who was 
<BR>
not so lucky to have that I can only imagine what you must be feeling now at 
<BR>
his passing.
<BR>
<P>It's very sad that you did not get the chance to talk to him seriously about 
<BR>
signing up for cryonic suspension.  But then you probably thought he had 
<BR>
decades of life still ahead of him.  There is still some hope with Tiplerian 
<BR>
theory or with the thought that in some way unknown to us now, that the 
<BR>
mind/personality does exist beyond physical death.  Your father may not be 
<BR>
as gone as some think.
<BR>
<P>Sean, my condolences to you at this difficult time.  How you live your life 
<BR>
would certainly be a tribute to your father.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
<BR>
