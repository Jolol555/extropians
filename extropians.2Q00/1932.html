<EM>&gt; The point I'm making is that ActiveX has a security model based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trust and authentication, rather than by restricting what an applet is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to do. This was a conscious and deliberate design decision, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft has never pretended otherwise or represented ActiveX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; security as analogous to Java sandboxing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, however the 'trust' issue has been twisted by detractors as being
<BR>
a 'security hole'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (The sandbox
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is an environment where Java applets run. Applets running in a sandbox
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have very limited functionality because they cannot access resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the user's system.) Imagine, for example, a check-writing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application that couldn't even save files to your disk but instead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; required you to re-enter the information each time you wrote a check.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is a ludicrous analogy, since using encrypted cookies is perfectly
<BR>
sufficient for that particular need.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Certainly an executable can be sandboxed as effectively as bytecode,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given sufficient operating system support. But that isn't the way ActiveX
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; works, or the way it was ever intended to work. I come down on the other side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of that particular design decision - in my view 'trust' requires eternal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vigilance, the cost of which in practice is indifference. How many times a day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do you click away the 'Anyone could read what you just typed' box while dealing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with forms? Have you ever refused anyone's authentication certificate? Now, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, I have only myself to blame if something gets though - but I don't find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a particularly great comfort.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course the ignorant blame everyone else or Microsoft if they
<BR>
ignorantly let their system get corrupted. Trust is not a commodity in
<BR>
great supply on the net. Its one thing to give out your credit card
<BR>
number, when you can get any fraudulent purchases reversed, but letting
<BR>
someone else into your computer is like letting them into your whole
<BR>
life (in many cases, thats exactly what it is.) The primary reason why
<BR>
ecommerce has grown as slowly as it has (and I do mean slowly. 50% a
<BR>
year is nothing when you are still talking less than 1% of the entire
<BR>
economy.) is that people are paranoid about the hacker boogieman, and
<BR>
computer companies are to blame for this for creating fear mongering
<BR>
commmercials in order to sell product.
<BR>
<P>For most newbies, trust only lasts as long as their first participation
<BR>
in a chat room.....
