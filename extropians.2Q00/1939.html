<EM>&gt;Date: Sun, 30 Apr 2000 13:38:49 EDT
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It's the prospect of some Deep Green, terrorist, hacker, or government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;installing a back door that gives me the willies.  Eventually, somebody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can design a &quot;people-killer&quot; in a skunkworks with the knowledge of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;super-ribosomes (or whatever), ecological design, and such that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;world clean-up&quot; program would require.  Such a day will come, I know,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but I'd prefer to delay it as much as possible to maximize defense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opportunities such as redesign/diversification of humans/transhumans,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;uploading, space colonization, and the kinds of hygenic measures I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mentioned.
</EM><BR>
<P>On a side note, this reminds me of something I meant to post last week and 
<BR>
then forgot.  It occurred to me that if I were Bill Gates or some equivalent 
<BR>
- or just a really good hacker - then simply promulgating a virus that 
<BR>
reported on a random but statistically significant percentage of stock 
<BR>
purchase orders, or the equivalent, by passing the information on to a 
<BR>
anonymous third party destination, let's say, would give me a major 
<BR>
day-trading edge.  Just knowing a few minutes or hours in advance of major 
<BR>
market moves would obviously be of tremendous value.
<BR>
<P>The reason Gates came to mind of course is the opportunity provided by being 
<BR>
the producer of Windows and a host of related products (unlike those 
<BR>
pathetic &quot;Netscape Weenies&quot;).  It would not be necessary to put in actual 
<BR>
&quot;back doors,&quot; in Windows or Word or Excel, etc.  It would only be necessary 
<BR>
to know exactly what everything did, having access to the source code, 
<BR>
natch, while everyone else was kept in the dark.  Even if the source code 
<BR>
itself were made public, trying to figure out WHY a particular subroutine or 
<BR>
class contained particular elements, when it was likely to be called by a 
<BR>
thousand different other routines would be the job of many, many man 
<BR>
lifetimes, for all the calls possible, if in fact it could be done at all 
<BR>
with any assurance of not missing something.
<BR>
<P>And what would be missed might not even be there!  If it took a binary virus 
<BR>
type of access to activate the hidden functions, with the actual processing 
<BR>
machine erasing all traces of itself afterwards, and of course the 
<BR>
cooperation, perhaps, of the MicroSoft server software in a similar manner, 
<BR>
then it would likely take the next generation of software to even notice 
<BR>
that anything was going on, and then it might look perfectly innocent, 
<BR>
unless you had a really, really good inference engine looking at all points 
<BR>
along the information path.
<BR>
<P>Bottom line is that with such a system in place, the ability to consistently 
<BR>
beat the market by just a few points would make the fortune of those with 
<BR>
access.  They could even deliberately introduce noise in their decisions, 
<BR>
just to throw off any surveillance, and STILL take over the whole ball of 
<BR>
wax.
<BR>
<P>Other similar strategies come to mind as I consider this.  One might sell 
<BR>
advanced stock analysis programs to major players, for example, with similar 
<BR>
reporting features.  With a large amount of information, one could scale 
<BR>
back ones actions to stay close to the noise level and still be a major 
<BR>
winner.  With smaller amounts of information, then one could play games with 
<BR>
third party investments.
<BR>
<P>Not that anyone of Bill Gates integrity could possibly be involved in such a 
<BR>
scheme...  But then, there were those MicroSoft engineers who got a little 
<BR>
frisky with Word - all on their own incentive, of course.
