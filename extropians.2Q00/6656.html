<P>
&quot;Life is too serious to be taken seriously.&quot; --Mike Leonard
<BR>
<P>&quot;I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems
<BR>
is just as dumb as the next guy.&quot;  -- Richard Feynman
<BR>
<P><P><P>Regarding the notion that 'extropianism is a cult'.
<BR>
<P>I suggest that, if any religion or cult can make fun of itself, then
<BR>
it really isn't really a religion or cult. I say this because
<BR>
religious groups usually take themselves very seriously. In fact, we
<BR>
have grisly evidence throughout history for some religions'
<BR>
seriousness.
<BR>
<P>It's a good sign when people who believe in their lives are stepping
<BR>
with music in their steps and smiles on their faces. It's not a good
<BR>
sign when those people are stepping heavily.
<BR>
<P>I, for one, would be the first in line to see a theatre performance
<BR>
of &quot;The Life of Maxine&quot;, a Monty-Python-like spoof of extropianism,
<BR>
performed along the lines of &quot;The Life of Brian&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I think that it would be fun to speculate on some of the characters
<BR>
and story plots. Some good satire, if you please! (Suggestions?)
<BR>
<P>And I offer to you the following thread of Extropian lightbulb jokes
<BR>
initiated in June 1992 by Andrea Gallagher, and pursued
<BR>
by Tom Morrow and others on the Extropians mailing list. It
<BR>
might be a good time to add a few more.
<BR>
<P>================================================================
<BR>
<P>OK, you've got you Extropian logo, you've got your extropian
<BR>
colors, you've got, heaven help us, your extropian handshake.
<BR>
So, the only thing I think we're missing is the official
<BR>
extropian lightbulb joke.
<BR>
<P>**********************************************************
<BR>
How many extropians does it take to change a lightbulb?
<BR>
**********************************************************
<BR>
<P>A.  Don't worry about that!  We'll just wait for the singularity.
<BR>
<P>A.  None!  In any properly run galaxy, we'll just MOVE THE STARS to put
<BR>
their light exactly where it is needed.
<BR>
<P>A.  None!  Lightbulbs don't burn out in virtual-reality...
<BR>
<P>A.  Extropians believe in dynamic optimism, which should hold that
<BR>
with the availability of a suitably advanced nanotechnology
<BR>
lightbulbs could become self changing, and indeed, self repairing.
<BR>
Failing that, the standard 1 extropian will do to change the bulb,
<BR>
while 12 stand by flaming.
<BR>
<P>A.  264. One to change the light bulb and 263 to argue about whether a
<BR>
universe exists where the lightbulb is still burning.
<BR>
<P>A.  One original, and as many copies as are necessary.
<BR>
<P>A.  None. They've insured the lightbulb with their protection agency.
<BR>
<P>A.  None. Why invest in such obsolete technology when nanotech is
<BR>
imminent?
<BR>
<P>A.  Wait, is it on an island?
<BR>
<P>A.  What is an extropian, I mean, really?
<BR>
<P>A.  None; they'll just switch their visual systems to infrared.
<BR>
<P>A.  &quot;Not now; we're trying to get free light from the quantum vacuum
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fluctuation.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A.  %^4FgT^hH%RR#$GH*857GHWr5@$%T 23$Tb@3546bskldvhj2934
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hmmm, this answer appears to be encrypted...)
<BR>
<P>A.  Two:  one to install a perpetu-bulb, and the other to blame the
<BR>
State for the crappy design of the first bulb.
<BR>
<P>A.  None, because that would infringe on the neighbors' riparian right
<BR>
to darkness.
<BR>
<P>A.  None; we'll let the State do it and then explain how we could have
<BR>
done it better.
<BR>
<P>A.  I don't know, but with full nanotech we could make
<BR>
as many Extropians as we needed...
<BR>
<P>A.  Depends on what you want to change it into...
<BR>
<P>A.  All of them:  one to hold the bulb and the rest to rotate the
<BR>
Universe.
