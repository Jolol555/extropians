I've just submitted my doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Observational selection
<BR>
effects and probability&quot;, which presents the first mathematically explicit
<BR>
&quot;observation theory&quot;. I use it to resolve a range of puzzles related to the
<BR>
&quot;anthropic principles&quot;, multiverse models, the Doomsday argument, etc. The

<P>Feel free to download it if you think it might be interesting to you. Any

planning to write this up as a book accessible to a wider interdisciplinary

audience, so your input would be come to good use.)

<P><P><P>ABSTRACT
<BR>
This thesis develops a theory of how to reason when our evidence has been
<BR>
subjected to observational selection effects. It has applications in
<BR>
cosmology, evolutionary biology, thermodynamics and the problem of time's
<BR>
arrow, game theoretic problems with imperfect recall, the philosophical
<BR>
evaluation of the many-worlds and many-minds interpretations of quantum
<BR>
mechanics and David Lewis' modal realism, and even for traffic planning.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After refuting several popular doctrines about the implications of
<BR>
cosmological fine-tuning, we present an informal model of the observational
<BR>
selection effects involved. Next, we evaluate attempts that have been made
<BR>
to codify the correct way of reasoning about such effects - in the form of
<BR>
so-called &quot;anthropic principles&quot; - and find them wanting. A new principle is
<BR>
proposed to replace them, the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of thought experiments are presented showing that SSA
<BR>
should be used in a wide range of contexts. We also show that SSA gives
<BR>
better methodological guidance than rival principles in a number of
<BR>
scientific fields. We then explain how SSA can lead to the infamous Doomsday
<BR>
argument. Identifying what additional assumptions are required to derive
<BR>
this consequence, we suggest alternative conclusions. We refute several
<BR>
objections against the Doomsday argument and show that SSA does not give
<BR>
rise to paradoxical &quot;observer-relative chances&quot; as has been alleged.
<BR>
However, we discover new consequences of SSA that are more counterintuitive
<BR>
than the Doomsday argument.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using these results, we construct a version of SSA that avoids the
<BR>
paradoxes and does not lead to the Doomsday argument but caters to
<BR>
legitimate methodological needs. This modified principle is used as the
<BR>
basis for a mathematically precise theory of reasoning under observational
<BR>
selection effects. This &quot;observation theory&quot; resolves the range of
<BR>
conundrums associated with anthropic reasoning and provides a general
<BR>
framework for evaluating theories about the large-scale structure of the
<BR>
world and the distribution of observers within it.
