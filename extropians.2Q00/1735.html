Subject: Ayn Rand returns to Russia!!!!!!!
<BR>
<P>The question was raised: What would Ayn Rand say about the following
<BR>
article?
<BR>
My response was that she would not have been able to say anything; she would
<BR>
have fainted dead away.

Putin's Adviser Extols Ayn Rand
<BR>
By Catherine Belton
<BR>
Staff Writer
<BR>
<P>Newly appointed presidential economics adviser Andrei Illarionov showed his
<BR>
economic colors Tuesday as he vociferously supported the ideas of one of the
<BR>
most influential shapers of Western thought on free markets - Ayn Rand.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Every import tariff and every limit on foreign-exchange transactions is a
<BR>
blow to our consciousness. Every tax acts against our freedom,&quot; he said at a
<BR>
news conference Tuesday dedicated to the launch of Rand's work in the
<BR>
Russian language. Rand gained acclaim in the 1940s for her theory of
<BR>
&quot;objectivism,&quot; which forwards laissez-faire capitalism as the only system
<BR>
to protect individual freedom.
<BR>
<P>Illarionov called for hauling back state interference in the economy and
<BR>
said it was a myth to claim that liberal reforms had taken place in Russia
<BR>
over the last eight years.
<BR>
<P>He added that for Russia to experience the &quot;economic miracles&quot; enjoyed by
<BR>
countries like Taiwan and Japan, state spending would have to be slashed.
<BR>
<P>&quot;If we really want fast economic growth, than sooner or later we have to cut
<BR>
down state spending to no more than 20 percent of GDP and cut back the tax
<BR>
base to the same level,&quot; he said.
<BR>
<P>President-elect Vladimir Putin has called for Russia to escalate economic
<BR>
growth to 10 percent per year to catch up &quot;fast&quot; to the rest of the world.
<BR>
But Illarionov would not say Tuesday whether his views on chopping back the
<BR>
state to achieve that growth had found favor with his new boss.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Mr. Putin listens attentively to all economic views and proposals and then
<BR>
makes his decision,&quot; was all that Illarionov would say.
<BR>
<P>However, Illarionov said he's hoping the rest of Russia will fall under
<BR>
Rand's spell. Dmitry Kostygin and Yaroslav Remenchuk, the publishers and
<BR>
translators of her works, said Tuesday they want to persuade the Education
<BR>
Ministry to make Rand compulsory reading in schools.
<BR>
<P>Putin meanwhile has a copy of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; in his personal library,
<BR>
Illarionov said, though he did not say whether the book had been read or
<BR>
appreciated by the president-elect.
<BR>
<P>Illarionov cited opinion polls in the United States as placing &quot;Atlas
<BR>
Shrugged&quot; as the second most influential book after the Bible, and singled
<BR>
out Rand's influence on Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the U.S. Federal
<BR>
Reserve.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Greenspan's been acclaimed many times over as the genius behind America's
<BR>
'New Economics' and the economic boom of the '90s. He was a personal friend
<BR>
of Rand,&quot; Illarionov said. &quot;If people here are likewise influenced by her
<BR>
work, than I will be very glad.&quot;
<BR>
<P>But while saying state regulation was a blow to individual freedom,
<BR>
Illarionov cited Chile's economic plan under the dictatorship of General
<BR>
Augusto Pinochet as an ideal example of good economic programming.
<BR>
<P>He also criticized Putin's economic think tank for planning to write a
<BR>
300-page economic program.
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's better for programs to be short. One of the best examples is the
<BR>
program produced by Chile. It was 15 pages long and simply laid out
<BR>
principles and the basis for the state's relationship with society,&quot; he
<BR>
said. &quot;1975 to 1990 was the golden period of Chilean economic reform,
<BR>
during which time Chile overtook the rest of Latin America.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Illarionov compared the Central Bank issuing monetary emissions that are not
<BR>
backed up by reserves to a citizen printing fake money in his own backyard.
