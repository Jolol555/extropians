<EM>&gt;From: &quot;John Clark&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jonkc@worldnet.att.net?Subject=Re:%20Transparency%20is%20impossible&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000403182605.57207.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">jonkc@worldnet.att.net</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Only if the transparency works both ways and the people doing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance are themselves under surveillance, but of course that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;impossible. The President would never agree to have a camera in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the oval office so all the world could see what he's doing,
</EM><BR>
<P>The President might not agree to have a tape recorder in the Oval Office 
<BR>
either (remember Nixon?) and he might not agree to have reporters all over 
<BR>
the world digging into his background to bring all his dusty skeletons to 
<BR>
the light of day (remember Clinton?), but the fact of the matter is that the 
<BR>
President does not make the laws, that is the job of Congress.  And once a 
<BR>
law is passed, the President (last I checked) is just as subject to it as 
<BR>
you and me (remember Clinton again?).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;and besides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I can always use encryption for things I don't want you to know about.
</EM><BR>
<P>No encryption is unbreakable, that is just a fact.  Further, if such 
<BR>
cypherpunk activities are criminalized, the very act of attempting to use 
<BR>
encryption for the purpose of tampering with the public record would likely 
<BR>
be construed to be a forfeiture of your rights.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'll find the camera, splice into the video line, and play back a recording 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reading the Bible, saluting the flag, and generally being a good little 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;boy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now I can do what I want.
</EM><BR>
<P>Until you are caught (which will probably be quite likely) and then you will 
<BR>
be sorry.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There are far too many cameras for somebody to be watching all of them all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the time, I'll do it when nobody is watching.
</EM><BR>
<P>I imagine that the video will be monitored by AI (or very powerful 
<BR>
unintelligent computers) for suspicious activity.  Yeah, yeah I know this 
<BR>
takes a lot more computational ability than is possible in 2000 a.d., right? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I ain't talking about a system that will be put in place this year.  
<BR>
Computers that can automatically search through telephone traffic for 
<BR>
keywords have existed since at least the 1970s.  I don't think it is much of 
<BR>
a stretch to extrapolate this technology to inclulde video feeds in the next 
<BR>
10-20 years.h

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
