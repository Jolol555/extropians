Firm funds clone research for transplants
<BR>
<P>By PENELOPE DEBELLE
<BR>
Friday 16 June 2000
<BR>
<P>A major United States medical company is funding Melbourne-based research
<BR>
into the cloning and genetic manipulation of pigs to provide organs for
<BR>
human transplantation.
<BR>
<P>The Australian Stock Exchange was advised yesterday about the deal by
<BR>
Illinois-based company Baxter Healthcare to invest an undisclosed amount of
<BR>
money into ongoing research by St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne and an
<BR>
Adelaide biotechnology company, BresaGen.
<BR>
<P>The aim of the research team is to clone a new pig from which the particular
<BR>
gene believed to be responsible for organ rejection in humans has been
<BR>
removed.
<BR>
<P>``At present, humans reject pig organs because of one particular bad gene,''
<BR>
said BresaGen managing director John Smeaton. ``By eliminating this gene, we
<BR>
are well on the way to eliminating one of the largest problems facing the
<BR>
transplantation of pig organs into humans.''
<BR>
<P>Head of the research Tony d'Apice, of St Vincent's Hospital's Department of
<BR>
Clinical Immunology, said the project sought to create a single pig from an
<BR>
altered pig cell nucleus that could be bred normally and potentially farmed
<BR>
for transplant organs.
<BR>
<P>``In vitro you can culture pig cells, any cells, and you can genetically
<BR>
modify them - the problem is to turn that into a whole pig,'' Professor
<BR>
d'Apice said.
<BR>
<P>The project, the only one of its kind in Australia, had been progressing for
<BR>
some years at St Vincent's before the partnership with BresaGen was formed
<BR>
and US funding sought.
<BR>
<P>Professor d'Apice said that at present no form of xenotransplantation -
<BR>
transplanting living material between animals and humans - had occurred in
<BR>
Australia, partly because ethical issues had not been ``thrashed out''.
<BR>
<P>The cloning process being developed in Adelaide is a technological
<BR>
prerequisite to removing the offending gene and creating a new and altered
<BR>
pig through cloning by nuclear transfer. ``What we are in the first instance
<BR>
trying to do is to perfect the technology of cloning a pig,'' Professor
<BR>
d'Apice said. ``Having perfected that, the next step is to then go on and
<BR>
use genetically modified nuclei in the nuclear transfer experiment.''
<BR>
<P>The most likely organs to be considered for pig to human transplantation are
<BR>
hearts and kidneys, and possibly pancreatic islet cells which have relevance
<BR>
for diabetics.
<BR>
<P>Despite recent successes in Melbourne and Adelaide with the cloning of cows
<BR>
and sheep, pig cloning has still to be developed in Australia. The only
<BR>
group to succeed so far is the Edinburgh-based PPL Therapeutics, who cloned
<BR>
Dolly, the sheep. ``Each individual animal species presents its own
<BR>
challenges,'' Professor d'Apice said. ``The pig is especially difficult.''
<BR>
<P>Professor d'Apice said developments in xenotransplantation were subject to
<BR>
continued assessment by bodies such as the National Health and Medical
<BR>
Research Council and, in the US, the Food and Drug Administration and the
<BR>
National Institutes of Health.
<BR>
<P>``This is happening in almost every major country in the world,'' Professor
<BR>
d'Apice said. ``It is a matter of trying to determine the risks and the
<BR>
benefits.''
<BR>
<P>The gravest potential risk to the future of pig to human organ transfers is
<BR>
the presence in pig DNA of retroviruses known as PERVS - pig endogenous
<BR>
retrovirus - which could infect humans.
<BR>
<P>``All the evidence at present is that they won't,'' Professor d'Apice said.
<BR>
``On the other hand, the safeguards and issues that would be involved are
<BR>
still the subject of discussion so that nobody today in this country has
<BR>
gone ahead with any form of xenotransplantation.''
