<EM>&gt; &gt; So people are still using Java?

<EM>&gt; Heh. Well, I know people who are learning Java, people who are teaching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Java, and people who are talking about Java. I've yet to find anyone who has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually built anything with Java, aside from the personal toy-project stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we all do to evaluate new technology.

<P><P>You may be a little out of touch with the market then.  Java is rapidly
<BR>
becoming a standard environment for large-scale back-end systems.  It *is*
<BR>
a major turd on the front-end, hence why you don't usually see Java there,
<BR>
but on the back-end it represents a very acceptable trade-off of features
<BR>
as a development environment.  Java is becoming a defacto standard for
<BR>
server-side web work, largely because it is superior to most other options
<BR>
as a general purpose back-end development tool in the Internet realm.
<BR>
<P>I have personally used Java for several large-scale (&gt;100k LoC) projects
<BR>
and expect to be doing an increasing amount of Java work on the back-end
<BR>
in the future.
