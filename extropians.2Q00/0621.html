<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; People who live in liberal democracies tend to forget about the violent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; basis of government power, because it is usually hidden beneath a veil of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; civility and bland legalisms. But that doesn't mean it isn't there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Democratic governments kill their citizens all the time (just ask a drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; dealer). Usually they direct their violence against 'criminals', which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; what makes them better than police states - but you have to remember that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the government gets to define who is and is not a 'criminal', and the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; real limit to what it can do is the willingness of the general public to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; acquiesce.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; All real power is based in force or the threat of force,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, it isn't. Those who try to ignore the objective reality of natural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law have to use force to fight against that objective reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and all I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; think you're pointing out here is that we've granted a monopoly on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; physical coercion to our elected government. That's treacherous, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; course, like any concentration of power, but in the end I don't see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what the other options would be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some of the most peaceful and prosperous countries are those with little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; professional military, and highly distributed and decentralized power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; structures, where the average citizen posesses the ability to bring a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant amount of force to bear if needed. Switzerland, for example,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the US (parts that don't have gun control) and New Zealand to lesser
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; degrees. Centralized power structures benefit nobody but themselves and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their further pepetuation and growth. There are always options.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I like the idea of collaborative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anarchy - it would be great if we were all equals and we could mediate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all our differences from bargaining positions of equal strength, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't believe it works. No one stays equal - you get kings,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; syndicates, warring city states - you get power which is unaccountable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the people living under it. And that power preserves and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; strengthens itself and wipes out threats to it's survival.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So as I've said, people who think like you buy the precept of &quot;People
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are no damn good and need to be kept penned up for their 'own good'.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; While we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; differ over whether it's been excessive, I'm sure you'd agree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Microsoft has been a vicious competitor. I shudder to think what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; world would be like if they and institutions like them could raise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; private armies to wage wars against competitors, strike contracts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with private police agencies to search your home for pirated software,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; conduct tariff negotiations via cruise missile, etc. This is obviously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a bit hyperbolic, but it at least evokes my vision of the nation without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some ultimate, constitutionally restrained, publicly elected and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; publicly accountable authority. But maybe I'm cynical or got beat up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one to many times in high-school.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Many would have been killed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I certainly don't think our government is perfect - drug laws, as you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mentioned, are a great example. I'm writing from New York State where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we live under the Rockerfeller Laws - extraordinarily harsh, mandatory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sentences for trivial drug offenses, deliberately designed to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; guilty pleas and bypass the pesky impediments to justice posed by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; right to trial and the presumption of innocence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You don't understand your own system. Your system is structured to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maximize the possible bribes that dumb middle class and wealthy people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to pay to cops, prosecutors, and mayors in order to get off or get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light sentences when they break the law. Since there are SO many laws in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NY, the average person can easily be found to be in violation of any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; number of laws without knowing it, and that makes the average person on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the street and easy victim for a police shakedown.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the goverment feels more comfortable when they have something on the
<BR>
citizen that they might call into question.  I read that somewhere.
<BR>
<P>It is certain that the citizens have many aspects of their government to call into
<BR>
question.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And I'm fairly irked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by paying $5 for a $1 pack of cigarettes because our leaders, in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; great and abiding wisdom, have decided smoking is bad for me and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ought to be dissuaded or punished for a character flaw.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You aren't being punished, you are paying for the 'cost to society' that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your bad habit imposes, both environmentally and on the social welfare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; health care system, don't you KNOW that??? C'mon, you're a loyal New
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yorker, thats why you people are suing gun manufacturers too....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree with that, payment for cigarettes goes to the cigarette manufacturers.
<BR>
In recent years, some of the cigarette manufacturers have been sued because of the
<BR>
societal cost.  Now they are being sued for the damages that have been incurred
<BR>
against smokers by selling them a highly addictive product with harmful
<BR>
additives.  Cough cough.  Also, a package of cigarettes doesn't cost a dollar, it
<BR>
costs about a quarter.
<BR>
<P>How come the price of a barrel of gas is the same as it was when the price for a
<BR>
gallon at the pump was much lower?  Someone is making a lot of money off of
<BR>
drivers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In the end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; though - our government is, at least in principle, bound by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; constitution and accountability to the electorate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is supposed to be and what is are completely different. &quot;It depends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on what the meaning of 'is' is.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>It is is is is, not is not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Private interests have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no obligation to observe them. Of course I have reservations, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we've had 200 hundred years of smooth transition of power, relative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; freedom and reasonable domestic tranquility.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I object to the us-versus-them character that discussion of government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has in so many of these debates. Government is us - it's elected by us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and made up of us - it's not some alien force, some evil monster out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to crush all that's good and free in the world. I have faith that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people in government are just like you and me, and most of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; believe in what they're doing and honesty feel they're doing what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; right - even when I disagree with them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Government is not US, its 50.00000001% of us crushing everyone else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thats the central fallacy of democracy. It doesn't represent everyone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just those who voted for whoever is in power.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it's actually a much smaller percentage.  The people who call the shots don't
<BR>
necessarily represent the majority.  That is why the framers rightly mandated at
<BR>
least some modicum of accountability.
<BR>
<P>The key here is that the government irritates different sectors for different
<BR>
unrelated things, so that none feel sweeping contempt for all of government, yet
<BR>
each bridles against injustice only to the extent where they will still pay their
<BR>
taxes and/or not start grassroots movement against government.
<BR>
<P>So, the key here is for each citizen to be educated and to have a reliable source
<BR>
of news on the government, and to be able for each as they would to have their
<BR>
weighted opinion made known to their representatives in voting government, ie,
<BR>
representation for their state of being a citizen, that is to say, one man (that
<BR>
is to say, one voting age citizen), one vote.
<BR>
<P>Government is government, it happens to be a large institutional bureaucracy that
<BR>
makes money by law and having the perceived power to enforce that.
<BR>
<P>Well, I write some more about drug policy as that was noted, although the only
<BR>
thing Microsoft has to do with drugs is that they like to appear high and have
<BR>
bake-offs.
<BR>
<P>I find some resources for this for my drug policy essay.

<BR>
<P>As the FBI Uniform Crime Report for 1998 notes:
<BR>
<P>&quot;The offense that resulted in the most arrests of persons
<BR>
under age 18 was larceny-theft, while adults were most
<BR>
often arrested for drug abuse violations. (See Table 38.)&quot;
<BR>
<P>So decriminalizing drugs would free up the majority of those kind of situations,
<BR>
if you get my drift.
<BR>
<P>Basically what I have been finding is that the current drug policy is racist and
<BR>
that it is more expensive than any costs it gains, thus the current drug policy
<BR>
leads to a waste of taxpayer money.  Also, it leads to perhaps among the largest
<BR>
of export deficits, dissing the cigarette people who sell tobacco to everybody.
<BR>
<P>So, decriminalizing drugs would save taxpayer money and be a strike against
<BR>
institutionalized racism.  Saving money and fighting racism are both good goals
<BR>
which would be served by drug decriminalization.  Fighting immoderate drug abuse
<BR>
is a separate goal that is not well served by the drug war.  Also, it would
<BR>
essentially remove the gray market monopolies of these goods, which would be good
<BR>
for capitalism.
<BR>
<P>Anyways, I must save some of this rhetoric for my drug policy essay so I will not
<BR>
write about drug policy reform specifically for a while, but maybe I will write
<BR>
about reform of other parts of government.
<BR>
<P>About a ruling of a court that there has been monopolistic practices, I guess that
<BR>
is the judgment of the court.
