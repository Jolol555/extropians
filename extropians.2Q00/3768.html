<EM>&gt;From: <A HREF="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Wireless%20ecommerce&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000525201645.29308.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</A>

<P><EM>&gt;I try to envision shopping on my cell phone or wireless PDA, and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doesn't sound very attractive.  Could this really take over a significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fraction of the purchases I make today?  Presently I buy some things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in stores, and some things online, but I don't very often find myself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;walking around and wanting to buy something online.
</EM><BR>
<P>I see it as more than just shopping.  It's all info, all the time.  Want to 
<BR>
see how little Johnny is doing in his kindergarten class?  Look into the 
<BR>
display screen on your wrist-watch/pager/cell phone.  Watch through the 
<BR>
class web-cam.  In the market for a new PC?  Describe your ideal system and 
<BR>
in a few minutes receive a call on your cell phone with a list of vendors 
<BR>
assorted by (1) price or (2) how closely their systems match your ideal.  To 
<BR>
buy the Dell, press 1.
<BR>
<P>You may not often have the urge now to shop while walking down the street.  
<BR>
But that's largely because right now, your choices are limited to basically 
<BR>
what's on sale at the store you happen to be passing.  But if you could shop 
<BR>
for your new car while jogging at the park, why on Earth would you ever 
<BR>
drive to a car dealership?  Hungry?  That Cantonese restaurant across the 
<BR>
street looks inviting, but you've never been there.  How about an instantly 
<BR>
accessible collection of reviews, along with a menu and price list?
<BR>
<P>To me, this whole wireless thing is just an incremental step to where we'll 
<BR>
all soon want to be.  I want to have it all (the whole internet) *inside* my 
<BR>
head.  I don't want to have to carry a cell phone or a clunky old Palm 
<BR>
Pilot, and certainly not a huge laptop.
<BR>
<P>Wireless is just the first baby step.  How can that *not* be a cool thing?
