</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your attitudes only make sense it you postulate a life of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infinite value given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cryonics success.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is true.  However, Robin, attempting to place a present value for
<BR>
future life via the calculation you used doesn't provide very much useful
<BR>
information due to the high degree of uncertainty.  For example, a small
<BR>
change in the discount rate assumed can cause a relatively large change in
<BR>
the present value.  The major problem I see, however, is that no one knows
<BR>
the probability of cryonics success.
<BR>
<P>The strategy I've found most useful when faced with an unknown like this is
<BR>
to keep several irons in the fire (for non-Americans--this is a cowboy
<BR>
expression which means to have several projects going at the same time).  In
<BR>
the case of life extension, in addition to signing up for cryonis, one might
<BR>
take steps to stay as healthy as possible and to slow down the natural aging
<BR>
process.  I don't think there's any one formula that can be applied to every
<BR>
person.  You have to figure out your own.  For me, two very important
<BR>
factors are keeping certain kinds of stress low and getting enough sleep.
<BR>
One might also leave non-organic traces of oneself such as writing,
<BR>
painting, music, technological inventions. And for me, experiencing as much
<BR>
joy as possible every day of my life ranks high among my priorities.  IMO
<BR>
the present emotional value of a relatively short, but joyful life, is
<BR>
higher than that of a long but unhappy one.
<BR>
<P>I have mixed thoughts about cryonics.  In a way, it offers a chance to
<BR>
defeat death, but to the extent our personalities are influenced by our
<BR>
environments, the person on the front end of the cryonic suspension wouldn't
<BR>
be the same person as the one who emerged in the new world of the future.
<BR>
To be unconscious for fifty or a hundred years and then to awaken...it's
<BR>
difficult to actually comprehend.  There have been times when I've been by
<BR>
myself in the woods for several weeks and then gone into town and felt quite
<BR>
alien.  I remember once some stranger said &quot;Hi,&quot; in passing, and I said,
<BR>
&quot;Hi,&quot; back and thought to myself &quot;How wonderful!  I can understand their
<BR>
language!&quot; as though I were in a foreign country.
<BR>
<P>For me, these are some of the deepest issues I've ever grappled with: what
<BR>
is self-consciousness? what is the self?  how are people connected to each
<BR>
other? (this question has to do with leaving cultural things like writing
<BR>
behind, and the memories of a person which continue on in other peoples'
<BR>
minds)  what's fearful about death? (this is of particular interest to me
<BR>
since I almost died one time, and the experience wasn't nearly as bad as I'd
<BR>
feared it would be; in fact towards the end, it was very exciting) DOES
<BR>
consciousness reside in the brain and other body parts, or is there more to
<BR>
it than that? (again, this is of particular interest to me since I've had
<BR>
experiences which lead me to believe that our culture's present
<BR>
understanding of consciousness is not the final word)
<BR>
<P>I know these questions have been discussed on this list, and I shall go back
<BR>
and read the archives and see what enlightenment I find there.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't estimate a life of infinite
<BR>
<EM>&gt; duration, or if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your values assign diminishing returns to long life, such as via
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discounting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the future, then the probability of success matters.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let me illustrate with a calculation.  A typical value of life-year is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; twice a yearly income.  For a yearly income of $50K, this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $100K/yr, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at a 2.5% discount rate gives you a value of life forever of $4M, and $2M
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for living thirty years more.  These are the sorts of ballpark numbers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; health economists use to make sense of observed choices between money and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; risk of death in cars, jobs, etc.
</EM><BR>
