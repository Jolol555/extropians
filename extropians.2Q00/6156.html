<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20SOC/TECH:%20Greenstar%20&lt;---%20MUST%20SEE&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGKEGFFHAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>

<EM>&gt;  I'd especially be interested in comments from our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineers - is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this as good as we can do RIGHT NOW to get electricity, medicine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the net
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which means education and working around the tin-pot dictators and local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thugs who run most of the poorer part of the world) into villages in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Third World?  It sure looks like it to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is Waaay Cool, Greg!  I'm not &quot;officially&quot; an engineer, but I've had to
<BR>
figure out how things work in order to build my house, get clean running
<BR>
water, etc.
<BR>
<P>I use a UV purifier for my drinking water (the one I use is sold for use in
<BR>
aquariums; I could get it at a fraction of the cost of a larger unit).  The
<BR>
lamp itself is enclosed in a glass tube, and the water flows around the
<BR>
outside of the tube, so that the water never comes into contact with the
<BR>
lamp.  There are some disadvantages of UV purifiers, one being that as the
<BR>
lamps approach the end of their useful lives, they become gradually less
<BR>
effective.  You'd have no way of knowing when this happens unless you
<BR>
periodically test the water for pathogens. The other disadvantage is that
<BR>
the water must be perfectly clear.  Particulate contamination blocks the UV
<BR>
rays. Purifying with chlorine is cheaper, and the chlorinated water can be
<BR>
run through a carbon filter to remove the chlorine before the water is used.
<BR>
I use chlorine with a carbon filter on my household water system.
<BR>
<P>In researching photovoltaics, I found that they're cost effective in low
<BR>
lattitudes if you take great care in desigining your system and use energy
<BR>
efficient appliances. There are companies which specialize in making
<BR>
appliances for use with solar and wind power, for example Dankoff pumps.
<BR>
The efficiency of their pumps blows my mind! I found that I'd come out ahead
<BR>
costwise by not purchasing mounts for my solar panels but rather by building
<BR>
my own mounts.  They're fixed, so I don't have the option of rotating the
<BR>
panels as the relative position of the sun shifts.  However, when I took
<BR>
into account the fact that my greatest use of electricity is during hot,
<BR>
sunny weather (I irrigate more, the fridge compressor spends more time
<BR>
running, we want to run the a/c) I found that it made sense to install the
<BR>
panels at a relatively shallow angle.  At this angle, they catch the maximum
<BR>
amount of light during the summer.
<BR>
<P>I've found that the greatest cost effectiveness can be had in my area by
<BR>
combining wind power with solar (my system isn't yet complete, because I
<BR>
haven't come up with the money to buy a wind generator yet.  But I just
<BR>
started a new business making concrete rings to go around lawn sprinkler
<BR>
heads.  There's no one making these things around here.  Perfect niche for a
<BR>
small business!  So I may have the money soon).  In order to get the most
<BR>
efficient design, a person would need to carefully study the annual
<BR>
variations in the climate of the place where the system will be installed.
<BR>
The local people would undoubtedly be able to provide this info, especially
<BR>
if they farm.  For this reason, I would tend not to want to buy a package
<BR>
deal but rather to work with the local people in designing the most suitable
<BR>
system for their location. This would have the added benefit of giving the
<BR>
people of the community the opportunity to take part in the creation of
<BR>
their community center, which I think is pretty important.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for posting this link, Greg!
