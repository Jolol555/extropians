<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Among my objections to government welfare is the enormous amount of waste
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;involved.  I decided to look up the relevant US figures for 1990 (a year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with readily available stats), and the figures are disturbing.  The amount
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spent per recipient was almost *twice* the income poverty line.  We could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;save 100 billion dollars just by cutting every recipient a check equal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the official poverty line.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think far more people would be helped if we just abolished the thing and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gave people the means to help each other. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite. This is one of the main motives for supporting a guaranteed income
<BR>
floor, or negative income tax, or some such measure (in so far as one
<BR>
continues to live in a community with taxing and redistributive powers).
<BR>
According to analyses I've read, this is cheaper than more bureaucratic
<BR>
interventions, less offensive to the recipient, more likely to lead to
<BR>
small local efforts. In the short term, anyway, before pre-Singularity
<BR>
earthquakes screw *everything* up. (Robin Hanson has indicated that he
<BR>
disagrees with this, which does give me pause.) 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Another statistic that should bother the more-or-less pro-welfare crowd: 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Over the long-term in the US, as the amount spent per person on welfare has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;increased, the number of eligible recipients also has increased.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your implication is that leeches breed leeches, or encourage would-be
<BR>
leeches. But a confounding factor you've apparently ignored, of course, is
<BR>
that the entire economic base has skewed enormously in that period. 
<BR>
<P>The glory of late-industrial/postindustrial civilisation is that so much of
<BR>
the horrendous toil of the world's work has been replaced by machines; the
<BR>
corollary is the devastating loss of work and earned income by those
<BR>
displaced and untrainable for the new jobs. If some leeches crawl into that
<BR>
category, it's still cheaper to let them scam the system minimally than to
<BR>
police and hound them out (or so I gather).
<BR>
<P>Better still, of course, will be the (re)invention of local community and
<BR>
fresh, non-destructive, satisfying ways for people without wage-earning
<BR>
toil to spend their days. That's something I'd like to see more extropians
<BR>
and transhumanists thinking hard about. But maybe real solutions will have
<BR>
to bubble up emergently from within those moieties.
