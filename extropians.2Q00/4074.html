<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From what I can tell, the wireless land-rush isn't toward offering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad web browsing on cell phones, it's about control, advertizing on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them based on where you are standing, and locked-in one-click
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purchasing, where a vendor can pay to become the one provider of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; service that is visible to you.  It's all about disempowerment of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumer, which is something that many businesses will pay big bucks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm going to be really interested in how this shakes-out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My cell phone might have to become voice-over-IP via a Linux PDA.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<P>This looks a lot like the current evolution of the ISP industry - i.e.
<BR>
you can get &quot;free&quot; connectivity if you're willing to suffer a constrained,
<BR>
advertising-rich environment.  Or, if you want, you pay more and get
<BR>
more control and capability.  No doubt lots of people wouldn't mind a &quot;sell&quot;
<BR>
phone, if it was substantially cheaper than the service would be otherwise.
<BR>
<P>Other people wouldn't put up with the hassle - and would pay to avoid it.
<BR>
The voice-over-wireless-IP you'd want would be such a &quot;premium&quot; service,
<BR>
that you'd pay for.  You'd escape the control, at a cost.
<BR>
<P>With both options available - and they would be, as big markets would
<BR>
exist for both - I don't see how anyone would be &quot;disempowered&quot;.
<BR>
