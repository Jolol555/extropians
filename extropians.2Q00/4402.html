<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The term &quot;urban sprawl&quot; is being tested by the Gore campaign as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one of its buzz-terms.  Central-planner-types are increasingly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;using this term as a stalking horse for re-entry into centers of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;power throughout the US.  And it seems there's a chance they'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have at least some success in this campaign, as dissatisfaction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the state of America's cities DOES seem to be growing.  As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the current longest period of economic growth in US history
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;continues, places like Silicon Valley and Atlanta are coming to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;join the ranks of the previous sprawl-queens, LA and Houston. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Commute times are growing at an increasing pace, as is the air
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pollution load caused by internal combustion engines.  Growing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cities ARE having an increasing negative impact on surrounding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ecosystems (although not nearly the level of damage that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;planners maintain).
</EM><BR>
<P>Imagining Al Gore trying to fix &quot;urban sprawl&quot; is enough to give me
<BR>
hives....
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I wonder what developments extropians would support as an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alternative to central planning to address this issue.  These are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some I see:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&lt;&gt; Natural &quot;Edge City Densification&quot;.  Here in Houston, we're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seeing a  pattern of commercial real estate development at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nodes of the main highway system on the outskirts of town.
</EM><BR>
<P>Joel Garreau wrote the book on this subject. (literally, &quot;Edge
<BR>
City&quot;) Want to build a Town/City? All you have to do is build a
<BR>
first rate school, and stand back....POOF! instant town. I also
<BR>
like the work being done by the &quot;New Urbanists&quot;, small planned
<BR>
communities.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&lt;&gt;  Telecommuting.  Talked about as a tonic to commuter gridlock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for a  decade, we OUGHT to be seeing an effect right about now as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more and more people have sufficient bandwidth in their homes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work from there. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I unfortunately don't have a job that translates to telecommuting
<BR>
well. (I'm one of the guys that build/maintains networks). But I
<BR>
agree this is increasing and will continue to.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&lt;&gt;  Electric/Hybrid Cars.  Long an electro-skeptic, I'm seeing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;electrics and especially hybrids coming closer and closer to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;competitiveness.  Especially with smarter and smarter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;power-management systems and lighter and lighter materials, I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;look for the significant impact of electro-hybrids on urban 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hydrocarbon pollution within the next ten years.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm a big fan of hypercars. The new Popular Science has an article
<BR>
on recent advances. They will increase in popularity as gas prices
<BR>
continue to increase. Of course I expect petroleum exporters to act
<BR>
to try to prevent them becoming popular.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&lt;&gt;  Smart Cars.  Although Gore supports &quot;smart highways&quot;, I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anyone with much sense knows that this is a stalking horse for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;major tax-and-spend orgy for the central planners.
</EM><BR>
<P>My car (mint 91 Buick Riveria) is already smarter than Al Gore. I'm
<BR>
just trying to imagine a highway system that runs on Windows......
<BR>
Think I'll walk instead.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm sure there are other trends and developments I'm overlooking. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Comments?
</EM><BR>
<P>Another great post Greg.
