<EM>&gt; Charlie please excuse my ignorance.  Ive never been to the UK,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but how does it work?  Suppose the local proletariate gets damn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tired of being watched?  Can you guys rise up in rebellion or something?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's been known to happen. (Remember, what country chopped it's King's
<BR>
head off and declared a [sort-of] Republic first -- England or France?)
<BR>
However, most people here _like_ being watched. The level of paranoia
<BR>
about property crime is scary, fostered by a media who like shock tactics
<BR>
because they sell newspapers/TV ratings. Surveilance is sold as the
<BR>
panacea that will fix all sorts of crime. And to some extent, it works.
<BR>
In general, people caught doing something naughty on videotape are easier
<BR>
to catch and more likely to plead guilty in court.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All I know is this country, which came into being as a direct result
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of rebellion, proletariate revolt by some accounts, so this sorta thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not looked down upon so much here.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you'll find the idea of revolt _is_ looked down upon in the USA,
<BR>
by the majority of the population who don't really agree with Thomas
<BR>
Jefferson's dictum. Don't believe me? Ask yourself why there haven't been
<BR>
any criminal prosecutions over the conduct of the Waco siege.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Someone mentioned the Seattle traffic ticket rebellion.  I was part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of that.  Got two parking tickets there in 1983, didnt pay em.  Can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Brits do civil disobedience?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Look into the Poll Tax riot. (If you can call three quarters of a million
<BR>
people marching on parliament a &quot;riot&quot;.) Brought down Thatcher.
