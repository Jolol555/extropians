<P><P>&quot;Tech Patriarch Sees Need to Keep Robotic, Genetic Genies in Bottle&quot; by
<BR>
Charles Piller
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is the pursuit of knowledge sacrosanct? Or should technological
<BR>
developments that promise profound benefits, yet may some day cause
<BR>
catastrophes, be halted?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such questions have traditionally been the province of academics. So
<BR>
when Bill Joy, chief scientist at Sun Microsystems and one of the most
<BR>
revered figures in high technology, recently suggested that scientists step
<BR>
back from genetic engineering, robotics and nanotechnology, eyes popped
<BR>
open.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most industry leaders responded like polite family members whose aging
<BR>
patriarch has begun to behave erratically. They politely discounted his
<BR>
suggestion as hysterical pessimism. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Joy's lengthy polemic in Wired magazine boils down to a simple
<BR>
premise: Humans are not ready to be gods, so we should pause long enough to
<BR>
think carefully before passing the point of no return with technologies that
<BR>
offer God-like powers--including the meaningful prospect of our extinction
<BR>
as a species due to acts of a misguided few. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The only realistic alternative I see is relinquishment: to limit
<BR>
development of the technologies that are too dangerous, by limiting our
<BR>
pursuit of certain kinds of knowledge,&quot; he wrote.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The counter arguments are obvious: Knowledge is its own justification.
<BR>
We can't slow--let alone stop--technological progress even if we wanted to.
<BR>
Such efforts would not only cause great harm, they elicit the nightmare of
<BR>
Stalin-esque perversions. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, any discussion of standing back from the prospect of
<BR>
technological cataclysm has to start with atomic weapons.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite heroic efforts of many scientists themselves--the Bulletin of
<BR>
the Atomic Scientists offers an inspiring example--proliferation of nuclear
<BR>
weapons continues apace while the U.S. Senate refuses to ratify a
<BR>
comprehensive test ban.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy cites the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention as a hopeful sign. In
<BR>
that unusual pact, most of the world's nations agreed to refrain from using
<BR>
a particularly heinous weapon of mass destruction and to destroy their
<BR>
stockpiles.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, that treaty is a thin reed on which to hang his
<BR>
argument. Many nations--most notably Iraq and the former Soviet Union--have
<BR>
ignored the pact's obligations or aided proliferation. And a loophole allows
<BR>
&quot;defensive&quot; research. To a greater degree than any other category of
<BR>
weaponry, nearly all aspects of offensive and defensive R&amp;D concerning
<BR>
biological weapons are identical.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such treaties are still crucial. But they reflect the limits of any
<BR>
such process when managed by the very class of scientists, politicians and
<BR>
technocrats that created the weapons.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The trouble with arms control is that it is an unnatural act,&quot; said
<BR>
Paul Warnke, former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
<BR>
&quot;Even when in the national interest, it requires countries to tear down what
<BR>
they have built up.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Joy's doubters find discouraging support for their opposition to
<BR>
unnatural acts in his own examples. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the lesson of weapons treaties fails to reflect the most
<BR>
provocative element of Joy's argument--the idea of standing back before the
<BR>
genie is out of the bottle.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy's first two examples, robotics and genetic engineering, are already
<BR>
well on their way. Deeply entrenched in research, commerce and popular
<BR>
culture, they have achieved a forward movement that seems, for better or
<BR>
worse, to be inevitable.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, most of the practical applications of nanotechnology--the
<BR>
creation of new materials and machines, atom by atom or molecule by
<BR>
molecule--are as yet unproved. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proponents of nano-scale machines foresee enormous potential for human
<BR>
benefit: microscopic particles with the intelligence of supercomputers that
<BR>
travel inside your body to destroy cancer cells; limitless, clean, low-cost
<BR>
fuel; or diamonds created from lumps of coal.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanotechnology also suggests horrors: micro-machines designed to
<BR>
destroy people with specific genetic traits, clouds of self-replicating
<BR>
nanobots designed for an ostensibly benign purpose--say, weed killing--that
<BR>
escape and devour all plant life on Earth in a matter of days or weeks. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanotechnology now exists in primitive forms, but its grand practical
<BR>
applications could make it a self-replicating, mass-production technology
<BR>
analogous in important ways to gene cloning. All this still may be decades
<BR>
away, if at all. So the nanotechnology genie has not been released, though
<BR>
the bottle is being rubbed.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can society step back from such a fountain of amazing wealth and social
<BR>
benefit because it might also be mishandled so dangerously as to destroy the
<BR>
world?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It won't be easy. First we need to develop greater skepticism for
<BR>
expert wisdom. Experts often lack special expertise outside their narrow
<BR>
areas and suffer many conflicts of interest. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, &quot;the sheer joy of resolving problems [is] a hard motivation
<BR>
to put down, because it does involve some of the best features of human
<BR>
nature,&quot; admits Theodore Roszak, a leading technology critic. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Roszak believes that powerful new technologies are far less
<BR>
likely to be massively abused by terrorists or governments than they are to
<BR>
spin chaotically out of control from corporations. Competition to exploit
<BR>
new possibilities will always bury the cautious few. Corporate adherence to
<BR>
the imperative of capitalism--grow or die--forbids any backward glance. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of colleagues who dismiss him, Joy wrote: &quot;I don't know where these
<BR>
people hide their fear.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one of the wisest of high tech's wizards questions the idea of
<BR>
technological inevitability, he offers hope that thoughtful, democratic
<BR>
management of technology may yet be possible.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's up to many of us to propose our answers.&quot;
