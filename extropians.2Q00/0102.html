<P><EM>&gt; Robert, just out of curiosity (i.e. wanting to put off disassembling Mercury 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and Venus until we've had a chance to really look them over) and a sense of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aesthetic nostalgia, do you think you could do your thing with some other 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter . . . at least for a while?
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting, Greg Burch, comes out as a closet luddite... :-)
<BR>
<P>Mercury has got to go, there is little point for salvaging it
<BR>
and it is in too useful a location from the standpoint of
<BR>
solar insolation and minimal delta-V required for an extensive
<BR>
power collection grid.  Fortunately, I don't think you
<BR>
have to disassemble much more for power collection.  For
<BR>
computronium, its another situation.  You might tap the
<BR>
CO2 in the atmosphere of Venus for diamondoid/buckytube
<BR>
materials where necessary, but this has the side effect
<BR>
of making Venus a nice place to visit (much to the dismay
<BR>
of hard-core environmentalists, I'm sure).
<BR>
<P>If, the pro-gravity camp wins the debate (for reasons beyond my
<BR>
imagination), then one might argue for retaining Venus and Mars and
<BR>
turning them into something useful (in a classical colonization sense).
<BR>
Mars, certainly, may have useful information from an archeological
<BR>
standpoint.  The pitfall I see though, in granting ground to the
<BR>
pro-planeteers, is that it puts you on a slippery slope.  &quot;Well, look,
<BR>
we have this capability, the planets will eventually get overpopulated,
<BR>
lets, just take all the excess planetary material in the outer
<BR>
solar system, build New-Mars, New-Venus, etc. and position
<BR>
them at various Lagrangian points around the inner solar system,
<BR>
so when the population overflows the current planets, we have
<BR>
places into which we can expand.&quot; Just where do you draw the line, eh?
<BR>
<P>I've always thought it would be useful during dissassembly
<BR>
to &quot;sample&quot; many microenvironments, strata, etc. at a very
<BR>
fine molecular level.  I believe there is something in the nanotech
<BR>
archives about doing this to the top 10-50m on Earth to the enable
<BR>
a complete reconstruction of the history of all primitive and historical
<BR>
cultures that existed (within the limits allowed by natural degradative
<BR>
processes).  On Mars this approach has the merit of providing the best
<BR>
way to go looking for fossils of life.  The real use however, is in
<BR>
providing the &quot;real&quot; VR simulations of Mars &amp; Venus, so those romantics
<BR>
among us can play out their &quot;conquest of space&quot; fantasies in very
<BR>
true-to-life environments.   The interesting problem is *where* do
<BR>
you get the memory to store all of that data that you collect?
<BR>
Now you are back to the problem of using the material for computers
<BR>
rather than planets.  Of course, if Ander's Jupiter Brain architecture
<BR>
is better than that of a Matrioshka Brain architecture, perhaps
<BR>
planets can be computers.
<BR>
<P>I'll buy the &quot;aesthetic nostalgia&quot; argument, but can you come
<BR>
up with a &quot;rational&quot; argument for leaving useful computronium
<BR>
in a nonuseful form at the bottom of a gravity well?
<BR>
