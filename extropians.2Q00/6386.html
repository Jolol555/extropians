This is about the most bizarre new story I have heard in some time.
<BR>
It seems so full of catch-22s its already up to a catch 110.  Whaddya
<BR>
make of it?  spike
<BR>
<P>CRITIC ACCUSES PENTAGON OF TRYING TO SILENCE HIM:
<BR>
As the debate heats up over whether the United States should build a
<BR>
national missile defense, one of the program's leading critics, an MIT
<BR>
professor, is charging the Pentagon with trying to silence him. This week,
<BR>
three agents from the Pentagon's Defense Security Service arrived
<BR>
unannounced at Theodore A. Postol's office at the Massachusetts
<BR>
Institute of Technology. They said they came to show the outspoken
<BR>
physicist classified documents, Postol said. But Postol said he refused
<BR>
to look at the papers stamped ''SECRET.'' Recalling the Army's attempt
<BR>
to classify his critical analysis of Raytheon Corp.'s Patriot missile after the
<BR>
<P>1991 Gulf War, he believes the agents' visit was a ruse to prevent him from
<BR>
speaking out further against the proposed antimissile system, which has
<BR>
already cost at least $60 billion.
<BR>
<P>&quot;By showing me classified information, they could say I was talking about
<BR>
classified information. I saw it as a means of abridging my First-
<BR>
Amendment rights.&quot; The surprise visit came more than a month
<BR>
after Postol, once one of the military's top science advisers, made
<BR>
headlines after a letter he wrote to the White House detailed potential
<BR>
pitfalls in the Clinton administration's missile-defense plan and exposed
<BR>
what he says is evidence of a cover-up. But shortly after the letter arrived
<BR>
at the White House, officials sent it to the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile
<BR>
Defense Office. Officials there promptly classified Postol's findings, even
<BR>
though the letter had already been posted on the Internet.
<BR>
<P>The move echoed the Army's attempt to muzzle him after the Gulf War,
<BR>
Postol said.  Caryl Clubb, a Defense Security Service spokeswoman,
<BR>
said the agents went to Postol's office to deliver a letter from the service's
<BR>
deputy chief of staff for industrial security. The document detailed areas
<BR>
in which Postol's White House letter contained classified information, she
<BR>
said. &quot;This entire episode is Kafkaesque,&quot; said Democratic US Representative
<BR>
Edward J. Markey of Malden, who said he plans to ask the General
<BR>
Accounting Office to investigate. &quot;First, you have the government
<BR>
classifying a report raising questions about potential fraud ... then you have
<BR>
government agents showing up at the author's office, trying to force him to
<BR>
read a classified document that he doesn't want to read.&quot; (Boston Globe)
