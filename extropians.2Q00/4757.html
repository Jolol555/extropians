<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Then government is optimal. Model the historical evolution of top-down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; control as a bottom-up market process and the aggregate result of billions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of locally rational, self-interested decisions. If you don't think the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; political/economic system won the market, you're just another mistaken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experttrying to out-guess the emergent result.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;LOL.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;This is one of the places where I think anarchists are a bit clueless. A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;market can operate only in the absence of force. It works only because all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;of the decisions made by the participants are voluntary, and each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;participant makes local trade-offs in the way that best suits his own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;desires. The moment you introduce actors that have the ability to compel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;others to do things at gunpoint, this is no longer the case. Instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;evolving in the direction of satisfying the desires of all participants, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;system then evolves to satisfy the desires of those who have access to force
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;at the expense of those who do not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is the argument for antitrust legislation, and I absolutely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; agree with you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; antitrust legislation merely changes the market to one where it evolves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to satisfy those willing and able to bribe the government into breaking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up their competitors. In an anarchy, everyone will be armed, so nobody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has a monopoly on force, and nobody can force others to their bidding.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think that's correct.  In anarchy anyone who can exert force to gain will,
<BR>
barring pacificists and particularly, sincerely moral people.  It's called survival
<BR>
of the fittest.
<BR>
<P>The government gets about a third of the GDP in tax income, they take a cut every
<BR>
time you buy groceries or live on your own land, they take a cut when you are born,
<BR>
drive, and die, they take a cut when you wed or split.  The (U.S.) government spends
<BR>
about 25% or more of its income on guns and other military spending, when we are not
<BR>
at war, except for the government on its own people.  The U.S. government imprisons
<BR>
more than 2 million U.S. citizens for various founded and unfounded reasons, paid
<BR>
for by the ones not literally shackled.  I'm sure anyone can provide examples of
<BR>
government waste.
<BR>
<P>The government needs correction like a choke-chain on a dog or some excisement,
<BR>
because parts are ferally malignant.
<BR>
<P>Overtaxation, overimprisonment, unequal treatment under law, and institutionalized
<BR>
infringements of rights are examples of bad government.
<BR>
<P>There are good things about good government. Most roads and public thoroughfares are
<BR>
well kept.
