<EM>&gt; &gt; Ok, so what factors have to occur before a &quot;singularity &quot; is attained?  Have

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My current thinking on hardware is 1e15 floating point ops/sec, with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minimum speed per CPU of 1e9 ops/sec and 1e12 ops/sec preferred.  Memory

<EM>&gt; required:  At least 1e12 bytes, probably more.  We'll have the hardware

<EM>&gt; before we have the software.

<P>Eliezer, have you given any thought to the possibility that as we understand
<BR>
what the architecture needs to do better, we will construct more efficient
<BR>
ways of doing it?  For example, the recently announced (French?) chip
<BR>
(for $6) that would do most of what the human vision system does in
<BR>
terms of things like object tracking.  I really doubt it is close to
<BR>
the optic nerve in power, but would seem to have collapsed the necessary
<BR>
algorithms onto current hardware.  Similarly the software that now
<BR>
does voice recognition or even OCR.  That stuff runs on hardware that
<BR>
is probably much slower than equivalent brain areas.
<BR>
<P>If Calvin *is* correct, I would have to believe the functionality of
<BR>
the # of columns in the brain can be collapsed into hardware that
<BR>
requires much less processing power.
<BR>
<P>The more and more I think about it, the more I suspect the real measure
<BR>
of brain capacity is in interneuron bandwidth.  That is the number we
<BR>
will need to match effectively.
