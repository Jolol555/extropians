<EM>&gt; &gt; However, there are very competent bodies who set out open industry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; standards for software, hardware and the Internet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Open standards are primarily a marketing tool used by companies that have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tiny market shares to persuade people to buy their products. Sometimes such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a &quot;standard&quot; will actually become so commonly used as to become the normal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way of doing things (i.e. HTML), but it is just as common for a completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proprietary standard produced by a big company to end up in that role (i.e.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ODBC).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just because a bunch of companies get together and issue a 'standard' does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not mean that their work should have any special protections, or that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone should immediately adopt it.
</EM><BR>
<P>HTML was not made by a company.  It was first written by a scientist
<BR>
looking for a better way to share information, and freely given away.
<BR>
There was no commercial incentive - at least, not until Netscape came
<BR>
along.  A number of other widely-supported computer standards - HTTP and
<BR>
Linux, to name a couple of the more popular ones - similarly had no
<BR>
corporate backing before they became popular enough for companies to
<BR>
take notice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Portability standards, like Java, HTML or POSIX, are essentially marketing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efforts launched by coalitions of companies who do not have enough market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; share to be viable competitors by themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Interoperability standards, like TCP and HTTP, are another matter. Because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their purpose is to allow products from different vendors to work together,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is usually in everyone's best interests to fully codify and support them.
</EM><BR>
<P>I submit the up-and-coming Wireless Application Protocol as a
<BR>
counterexample.  It's an interoperability standard that, at its start,
<BR>
was launched by Unwired Planet (now Phone.com) and whoever it could beg
<BR>
into supporting.  WAP is sufficiently unstable that, aside from
<BR>
Phone.com, practically everyone who officially supports WAP also
<BR>
supports WAP's competitors - for instance, UDP/IP.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No one is *entrusted* with anything in a free market. Commercial entities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can only control a vital technology if they are actually doing a decent job
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of managing it, because the moment they begin making mistakes they create an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opportunity for rivals to make big money by fixing things.
</EM><BR>
<P>So long as the screw-ups haven't placed so many barriers to leaving -
<BR>
for instance, holding the domain name they bought for you even after you
<BR>
send notice to NSI that the ISP no longer has your business and thus no
<BR>
longer has a right to your trademark, or just plain buying up the ISP
<BR>
you were going to switch to - that switching becomes financially
<BR>
infeasable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; (such as because Microsoft's are buggy and insecure).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ten years ago this remark would have been on target. Five years ago the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter would have been arguable. Today it is simply ignorant prejudice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Microsoft's current performance in both these areas is in the top 25% of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industry, and still improving at a steady rate. They aren't the best in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world, but they are much better than average, and unless the Unix vendors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get their collective act together they *will* be the best in another five
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years or so.
</EM><BR>
<P>...by virtue of having bought up or run out of business all competition
<BR>
that did have their act together.
