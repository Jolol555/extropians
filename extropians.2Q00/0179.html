<EM>&gt; &gt; All this incomplete coverage will do is cause more criminals to commit crimes in

<EM>&gt; &gt; areas that ARENT under coverage. The crime rate in more rural areas will go up,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people will get whacked out on the moors, etc.

<EM>&gt; Right you are Mike.  If we go with transparent society, we *must* set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aside reservations or no cam zones somewhere.  We have repeatedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demonstrated that we as a society cannot totally eliminate crime.  We can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only localize it.

<EM>&gt; Some of you will be in Palo Alto in May for the Foresight nanoschmooze.  There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you may see a social experiment of sorts.  In Palo Alto, there is waaay more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money than anyone knows what to do with, therefore there are many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; private security systems which include recording, time-stamping cameras.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just on the other side of the freeway is a community where the Bay Area
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has pretty much decided to park its poor, its criminal element, etc, called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; East Palo Alto.  There are few police there, even fewer security cameras.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Look it over if you are in the neighborhood.  If the Bay Area goes transparent,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would propose East Palo Alto as a no-cam zone.  spike

<P>There is a sf book I read a month ago that was published in the 50's called _Gladiator
<BR>
At Law_, that does a pretty good job of forecasting a serious dichotomy like you
<BR>
describe, only its not surveillance that causes the dichotomy, but a technology of a
<BR>
fully automated house that a guy develops, but his patent gets controlled by major
<BR>
industry to house its employees (on a lease basis of course) as a benefit of
<BR>
employment (much as health insurance is used as a tool by employers a lot).  A good
<BR>
read.
