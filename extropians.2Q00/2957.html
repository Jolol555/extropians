<P>
Dear Sasha,
<BR>
<P>I have read the notes from Max and Greg and Anders and Tanya
<BR>
and Natasha and Kathryn and Mike and Lee and countless others.
<BR>
Clearly, they have been touched by your transformation.
<BR>
<P>It has been a busy week for me, working on things I know
<BR>
you would appreciate.  The new paper by Robert Freitas
<BR>
(@ <A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/NanoRev/Ecophagy.html">http://www.foresight.org/NanoRev/Ecophagy.html</A>)
<BR>
discusses some of the problems we face and possible solutions
<BR>
we may have in the forthcoming development of nanotechnology.
<BR>
<P>Had I not been so busy, I would have come to Boston to
<BR>
visit you.  I hope you can accept my need to balance moving
<BR>
forward with looking back.  In the future, I think I should
<BR>
devote more time to interpersonal relationships, but this is
<BR>
a difficult thing for me, so I have a lot to learn.  I wish
<BR>
we had had more opportunities to learn it together.
<BR>
<P>One thing that I had wanted to communicate to you that you
<BR>
may not have known, is the degree to which you contributed
<BR>
and influenced my discovery of the Extropian community.
<BR>
I think I was doing some net research back in '96 or '97
<BR>
regarding nanotechnology and Moravec's work, and your WWW
<BR>
pages impressed me greatly.  I think Eugene once commented
<BR>
something along the lines of &quot;Where did you come from?&quot;;
<BR>
the answer of course is that I am a Sasha's child (and
<BR>
Ander's and a number of others).  It is an amazing and
<BR>
rewarding thing I think, to give birth through nothing more
<BR>
than the expression of memes.
<BR>
<P>Of course, now that you have decorporealized, it is
<BR>
difficult for you to comment on my thoughts.  But there
<BR>
are others who may do so.  I must say that I find
<BR>
trends towards magical physics, hopeful universe
<BR>
reconstructions, etc. quite silly.  Would it not be
<BR>
better for you to be recreated from your memoirs as 
<BR>
an entity with whom we can interact in the next century
<BR>
rather than waiting until the end of the universe?
<BR>
(You must of course have read that book where two countries
<BR>
had recreated Machiavelli and Napoleon as advisors...)
<BR>
[Some Extropian must remember this title, for I cannot...]
<BR>
If your desire was to be uploaded, then there are likely
<BR>
to be relatively minor differences between a Sasha
<BR>
copy and the Sasha recreation, because you have been
<BR>
thoughtful enough to leave us with so many expressions
<BR>
of yourself.
<BR>
<P>While I realize that recreations are not originals,
<BR>
they allow us to experience and develop relationships
<BR>
that might otherwise be unavailable.  And since experience
<BR>
is entirely subjective what is really important is whether
<BR>
we perceive you as an accurate instantiation of yourself.
<BR>
And of course even with &quot;live&quot; humans, instantiations are
<BR>
subject to a wide range of variation (so much so that
<BR>
people often find themselves asking whether or not the
<BR>
person is not someone completely different), so it will
<BR>
be difficult to know whether the A-Sasha *is* Sasha.
<BR>
But from a metaphysical standpoint, does that really
<BR>
matter if A-Sasha, derived from Bio-Sasha, responds
<BR>
in substantially similar ways? 
<BR>
<P>On to other topics, I would have to believe that you would
<BR>
favor e-libraries/memorials to physical instantiations.
<BR>
Heavens, for the next couple of dozen years, getting your
<BR>
memiors out of a Phys-library would simply be *so* slow.
<BR>
It is my hope that you would look fondly on our collecting
<BR>
and organizing our experiences of you so that we may
<BR>
recreate a reflection of you to bring discussion,
<BR>
controversy and joy to our lives.
<BR>
<P>Now regarding this pesky cryonics, copy, etc. issue
<BR>
I have a few comments.  Clearly, humans, running &quot;ancient&quot;
<BR>
attachment code have a preference for something resembling
<BR>
the real thing.  Yes, I know, how can something with
<BR>
physically different atoms (or worse fundamentally different
<BR>
low level hardware) be the &quot;real thing&quot;?  People seem to
<BR>
strive for a solution that minimizes &quot;real&quot; differences
<BR>
without taking into account whether or not the differences
<BR>
may be perceived.
<BR>
<P>So, in your memory, I would hope that you could support
<BR>
the establishment of the &quot;Sasha Chislenko Memorial Cyronics
<BR>
Fund&quot;, as I believe Jeff has proposed.  I am unsure of the 
<BR>
operations and logistics of such a fund.   Should for example,
<BR>
we seek to use BlackOps approaches to preserve such individuals
<BR>
as Eliezer &quot;copies&quot;, given the original fails to appreciate
<BR>
his value to the community?  Are there moral precedants
<BR>
under which the community can claim ownership of a copy?
<BR>
<P>I will leave you with these thoughts, stating simply that
<BR>
your company will be missed.  While I empathize and
<BR>
sympathize with your family and friends, such is my
<BR>
nature that I am much more sorry and aggrieved for
<BR>
those individuals who never had a chance to meet you
<BR>
and those who may yet perish because your ideas may
<BR>
take much longer to become manifest.
<BR>
<P>With sorrow in my heart and tears in my eyes,
<BR>
Robert Bradbury
<BR>
<P>Side note to the group: I have been wrestling with
<BR>
a song in honor of Sasha, but I am not up to the task.
<BR>
I think it should be done to &quot;Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie&quot;
<BR>
with words appropriate for Sasha.  I would like to suggest
<BR>
that individuals of a more artistic nature than I,
<BR>
compose one or several verses from which we can select, in
<BR>
order to sing a memorium to Sasha at the next Extro conference.
<BR>
<P>Sasha in whatever form -- atoms, molecules, multi-dimensional
<BR>
space distortions, etc. will hear our song and be honored.
<BR>
