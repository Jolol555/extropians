just not the... manliest man you ever saw.  However it does

have its advantages.  I am looking into putting together a

wearable computer.  I can carry the CPU and batteries

<P>At six foot one and barely one-hundred and fifty pounds I am not Hercules 
<BR>
either! lol  I have a friend who says I should not try to cover up my 
<BR>
skinniness, but instead show it off because that is who I am and some women 
<BR>
really are into skinny men.  Of course, many women are into buff or at least 
<BR>
filled out guys.

<P>I may have seen too many Hanz and Franz skits on Saturday Night-live...  I

cameo appearance by Arnold, oh well.

<P>Working out tones me, but does not bulk me up.  After working out for three

months with weights, I think I gained about two pounds!
