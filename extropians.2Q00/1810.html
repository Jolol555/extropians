I'm engaged in a debate on another list.  I thought I'd share some of my 
<BR>
posts from that list here:

<EM>&gt;  &gt;Perhaps not, but do you feel you have some basis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;for restricting their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;freedom to make choices about their offspring?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;Assume for the sake of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;argument that there is a clear use of genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;technology to somehow avoid a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;disease or otherwise improve a person's child.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;you have the right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;restrict that person's choice to employ that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;technology, regardless of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;parent's wealth?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Yes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If people could afford to have their own nuclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  power plant in their back garden, would I try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  stop them ? Yes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If they decided to plant GM modified seed in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  garden, would I try to stop them ? Yes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If people could afford to pay enough to encourage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  people to part with their organs, would I try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  stop them ? Yes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If people decided that implanting microchips in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  their childrens heads improved their behaviour,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and made them socially more acceptable, would I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  try to stop them ? Yes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I am not really interested in debating the moral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  niceties or not, of some intangible future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  benefit, that rich people may or may not have.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  No one, even the most rabid pro-GM'ers are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  pretending that we are all going to get to choose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the genetic makeup of our children.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If, and it's a very big if, this becomes viable,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  it will happen on two levels.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  1. Rich people get to choose.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  2. The rest of us have it imposed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Chris, clearly there is a huge &quot;value gulf&quot; between us.  You seem to feel you 
<BR>
know enough to impose deep restrictions on the choices other people can make. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Of course it's easy to imagine scenarios where the actions of other people 
<BR>
threaten your interests enough to justify interfering in their liberty.  
<BR>
Jumping to conclusions about how threatening those actions are and painting 
<BR>
them in terms of absolutes makes it all the easier to clothe one's self in 
<BR>
the kind of self-righteousness that justifies more and more restrictions on 
<BR>
the individual's right to choose.  Seeing things in terms of &quot;rich people 
<BR>
rule the world, the rest of us are downtrodden&quot; appears to be a key 
<BR>
ingredient of such self-righteousness.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Moral niceties&quot; are the fabric of civilized society.  Where will you draw 
<BR>
the line in restricting choices based on wealth?  Will you demand that every 
<BR>
child have exactly the same education, because some can afford to send their 
<BR>
children to &quot;better&quot; schools than others?  Will you demand that we all dress 
<BR>
exactly alike, because some can afford more fashionable clothes than others?  
<BR>
Who will be on the &quot;Committee for Public Safety&quot; that makes such choices?  
<BR>
Perhaps if Orwell were alive to update &quot;1984&quot;, he would add a &quot;Ministry of 
<BR>
Nature&quot; to the government that included the Ministries of Truth and Love.
<BR>
<P>I have to assume that the recent breakthrough in France in which genetic 
<BR>
engineering was used to correct an immune deficiency syndrome in children 
<BR>
should be prohibited because it is not immediately available to all.  I 
<BR>
suppose it would be particularly offensive if this procedure could have been 
<BR>
done at the germ-cell level, so that parents could conceive a child without 
<BR>
the disease in the first place.  As they say of the fundamentalist christians 
<BR>
here in the U.S., they disaprove of premarital sex, because it might lead to 
<BR>
dancing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;
