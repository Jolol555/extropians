<P><EM>&gt; I saw a pointer on slashdot yesterday to this article at EE Times:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.eet.com/story/OEG20000421S0024">http://www.eet.com/story/OEG20000421S0024</A>.  It discusses some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issues relating to future progress in miniaturization of electronic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circuitry.
</EM><BR>
[snip]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The other interesting thing about the article was their long term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; projection for shrinking feature size.  It shows a decrease from 180 to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 25 nm over 18 years, a factor of 7.2.  If density is proportional to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; square of the feature size, that would be a density increase of 52, about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6 doublings.  6 doublings in 18 years is one doubling every three years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That would represent a halving of the traditional rate of increase of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moore's Law, which has been quoted as a doubling of density every 1.5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years (actually variants using 1 and 2 years also exist).
</EM><BR>
<P>Not all of the improvement in Moore's Law has been due to simple
<BR>
increases in circuit &quot;density&quot; (due to decreases in line width).
<BR>
There have been changes in device architectures as well.  There
<BR>
are several of those in the pipeline that are designed to change
<BR>
the architecture of DRAM cells as well as turning the transistor
<BR>
architecture on its side.
<BR>
<P>Then of course we have copper interconnects slowly being implemented.
<BR>
One has to wonder if we will one day see silver which has lower resistance.
<BR>
There is a fair amount of work going on with software on compiling code into
<BR>
gates.  Given the progress Transmeta has made on the software side the
<BR>
next logical progression (given the large chips that will be available)
<BR>
will be a large chunk of gates into which the highly used code segments
<BR>
can be &quot;compiled&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Processor-in-Memory is coming as well as a some work on asynchronous clocks
<BR>
and reversible computing.  Reversible computing gets phased in when they hit
<BR>
the limits of decreasing voltages and have to do something about power
<BR>
consumption as the clock rates continue to increase.  The adoption of
<BR>
reversible computing architectures is the only place I expect there
<BR>
might be a blip in the current trends.  That is because you have to
<BR>
take a fairly large hit in gate count to implement reversible architectures.
<BR>
<P>In general however, I'd not hurry to the window to place my bets against
<BR>
Moore's Law slowing down anytime soon.
