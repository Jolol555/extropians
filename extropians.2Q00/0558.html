<EM>&gt; The basic problem that I see is that there is no real competition in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the i86 operating system market.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but let's remember the whole situation. There are several non-i86
<BR>
platforms that could suddenly become viable if either Intel or Microsoft
<BR>
stumble badly enough, and several OSs (notable Linux) that run just fine on
<BR>
the i86. So, Microsoft's position is not equivalent to being, say, the only
<BR>
diamond mine in the world. There are lots of potential competitors out
<BR>
there, and MS's market share depends on its ability to fend them off
<BR>
successfully.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, obviously I think monopolization is a bad thing - so you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insert all those standard arguments here.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are using 'monopoly' in a different sense than I do. Having a 90% market
<BR>
share (or even 100%) doesn't make you a monopoly. A monopoly is an
<BR>
organization that can charge its customers above-market prices for its
<BR>
products, or somehow coerce them into buying products they do not wish to
<BR>
purchase, without fear of loosing ground to competitors.
<BR>
<P>By that standard MS as a whole doesn't qualify, because there are no
<BR>
barriers around its markets that prevent competitors from emerging.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What it really comes down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to, I think, is that control of the PC platform is too important to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trust to a single corporation: there's too much potential for abuse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and we loose the advantages of distributed economic optimization. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is an abstract compliant, not one specific to Microsoft. Perhaps you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't object to monopolization as strongly as I do, either because you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it's unstable or because it's a lesser evil than government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interference.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, for both of those reasons. I thing people who favor anti-trust tend to
<BR>
forget that what they are advocating is a law that requires the government
<BR>
to seek out the most successful businesses in any given market and
<BR>
confiscate their property for the benefit of their competitors. That harms
<BR>
the customers, by preventing them from buying the products they wanted.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I think this is a stasist way of looking at things. No one
<BR>
'controls' a free market. Every purchase is voluntary. The only way a
<BR>
company can succeed in the long run is by giving customers what they want -
<BR>
and the 'long run' in the PC business is only a couple of years, so the idea
<BR>
of waiting for market forces to work things out is not a big problem for me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There will never, without government intervention, be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementation of Windows offered by anyone other than Microsoft. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; API is too big and the target is moving too fast. Consider the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; failings of Win-OS/2, and the Wine project.
</EM><BR>
<P>Isn't this an argument against intervention? The two justifications for
<BR>
anti-trust law are to encourage innovation and to keep prices low. If your
<BR>
statement is true, that knocks out the first justification. The fact that
<BR>
low prices are a primary complaint of MS's competitors seems to knock out
<BR>
the second as well. That leaves only a general distrust of companies with
<BR>
large market share - and if you let the government confiscate private
<BR>
property on mere suspicion of possible future wrongdoing, no one will ever
<BR>
be safe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, then, what is are appropriate remedies? I'd like to see, as I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggested before, a prohibition against government itself purchasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software based on non-open standards.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the government can certainly make any rules it likes for its internal
<BR>
purchasing. It does have one side effect you've missed, which is that it in
<BR>
effect forbids the government from ever buying from a dominant vendor. In
<BR>
the computer industry the general pattern is for dominant players in any
<BR>
given market to define their proprietary standards, which then become de
<BR>
facto industry standards if they are any good (ODBC is a good example of
<BR>
this). The minor players then band together to create an 'open' standards to
<BR>
compete - they make it open because they have to in order to pool enough
<BR>
market share to make their efforts matter.
<BR>
<P>Now, requiring the government to always side with the underdogs probably
<BR>
won't really hurt anything, but will tend to lead to higher costs and more
<BR>
frequent vendor turnover than making a informed decisions on a case-by-case
<BR>
basis. Of course, the government isn't very good at informed decision
<BR>
making, so they may not be loosing much.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd like to see a market where I don't buy an 'operating system,' I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buy a memory manager, a tasking subsystem, a file system, a desktop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment, etc, from independent vendors - and they all work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; together because they all conform to open standards; in the same way I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can purchase a nut and a bolt from two different manufactures because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they come in standard sizes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Everyone wants software to be modular and reusable, but there isn't much
<BR>
agreement on how to achieve this goal. Is there some particular action you
<BR>
think the government could take that would yield this result?
