<EM>&gt;I think most of the concepts discussed would not be considered

<EM>&gt;too advanced by the folks on this list, but it was quite a lot for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;public meeting.  Hofstadter said the topic he really wanted was &quot;Who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will be we in 2100?&quot;, and the discussion got interesting when Hans

<EM>&gt;started talking philosophy of identity.

<P>Interesting--the day before the event I was discussing the symposium with 
<BR>
Hofstadter, and stressed the importance of dealing with this issue (since 
<BR>
Joy off-handedly remarks on it in his essay), and noted some of the work 
<BR>
I've done in this area.

<P>EXTROPY INSTITUTE'S POST-SYMPOSIUM SYMPOSIUM
<BR>
Extropy Institute is planning a post-symposium web page. We are inviting 
<BR>
the symposium panelists to add comments (rebuttals or additional comments 
<BR>
they didn't get to make) and responses to other comments. But we also want 
<BR>
to include concise and well-thought out comments on the symposium by any of 
<BR>
you who attended. We can also include some of the fine comments already 
<BR>
posted here in response to Joy's original essay.
<BR>
<P>I'll be adding my own comments as soon as the webcast is released. If 
<BR>
anyone discovers that it's been released before I do, please let us know 
<BR>
here. I understand that it will be available soon at
