&quot;The government grants vastly different amounts of taxpayer 
<BR>
money to different magazines, depending on how effective their 
<BR>
content is deemed at building support for the war on drugs.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Drug War Gravy Train, Salon.com -
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://salon.com/news/feature/2000/03/31/magazines/index.html">http://salon.com/news/feature/2000/03/31/magazines/index.html</A> 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again the Internet journal Salon.com has exposed 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a surreptitious collusion between major media and the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government. In Salon's latest expose we discover that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than 20 magazines conspired with the government 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to include War-on-Drug propaganda in their regular 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;objective&quot; news and contents rather than running 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;antidrug advertisements. Some of those magazines are:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life, Newsweek, Time, U.S. News &amp; World Report, People, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reader's Digest, TV Guide, Sports Illustrated, Essence, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ladies' Home Journal, Teen, Vibe, People En Espanol, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Life, Sporting News, Family Circle, Seventeen, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parade, and USA Weekend. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A journalist whose story was subjected to oversight by 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the government told Salon: &quot;This is a clear violation 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of journalistic ethics. It's really egregious. This 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shapes the type of reporting you're doing and what 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;editors are asking for... If we ever did something 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like this as a writer -- showed a story to a source 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ahead of publication, say -- our career would be finished.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other members of the media are more eager to serve 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the federal government's agenda, as one magazine 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spokesperson told Salon: &quot;We do exactly what Congress 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asks us to do. We totally comply with the drug-control 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;office requirements.&quot; This is not an independent media!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salon previously revealed that most major television 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;networks had also conspired with the federal government 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to propagate Drug-War propaganda under the guise of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their regularly featured television programs. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that most of the major networks and magazines 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went along with this scheme and NONE of them came forward 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to inform their consumers either (a) that their product
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was written to comply with government-content requirements 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or (b) that the government had approached them with a scheme 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to surreptitiously include propaganda into their news and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entertainment programming, which would surely have made a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;major story! The systematic and cooperative nature of this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collusion tends to suggest a long-term Govt/media collusion:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the axiom &quot;power corrupts&quot; is a reliable axiom,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the Official Story must be suspect on its face.
