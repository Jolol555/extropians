</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I'm currently living in the world of self employed IT contracting. It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty risky, and I don't have savings to fall back on (yet)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  this is a terribly risky venture for me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a difficult situation that many contractors face; I do not know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether I will have a job past 1 August. Do I stay? Suddenly, my income
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stream may evaporate, and what does my family eat?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do I go?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Luckily, I'm in a country with a solid welfare system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Much as I'd loathe doing it, I have this to fall back on.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm with you so far, Emlyn.  I've been self-employed in one line or another
<BR>
for most of my adult life, and I've subsisted on beans, bread, and vitamin C
<BR>
tabs while all the money that came in from my business went to pay my
<BR>
employees &amp; for other overhead expenses. After being wildly successful for a
<BR>
while, I've had the experience of utter failure and shutting the doors to my
<BR>
business &amp; moving to a one bedroom apt. in one of the worst parts of town
<BR>
(across the street from a crack house frequented by gang members--I had to
<BR>
teach my kid to drop to the floor when the shooting started outside our
<BR>
windows), pedalling away from my 4500 sq. ft. house in the ritzy
<BR>
neighborhood, the big bank account and the shiny red Alfa Romeo only a
<BR>
memories, dragging my remaining possessions behind me in a bugger (that's
<BR>
the name of a bicycle trailor). I've had to drink gallons of water to get
<BR>
rid of a bladder infection, because I couldn't afford to go to a doctor and
<BR>
get antibiotics. I know what it's like to take a risk.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Luckily, I'm in a country with a solid welfare system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Much as I'd loathe doing it, I have this to fall back on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If there was no welfare system, I would be back in the public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; service like a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shot.... The system I'm building would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely not exist, and have no hope of existing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's where you lose me. Most of the entrepreneurs I've know personally
<BR>
have been what you might call risk-seeking individuals. They thrive on risky
<BR>
situations.  It's apparent that at least some of the theoretical work behind
<BR>
new technologies is done by risk-averse people; that's why people like your
<BR>
employer are important in the overall scheme of things, because they can
<BR>
provide the steady (though perhaps uncertain) pay check for the people who
<BR>
are not willing to take the raw risk.
<BR>
<P>I can understand why a person would want a safety cushion, and a solid
<BR>
welfare system is one way to acheive this.  I'd like to suggest that it may
<BR>
not be the only way or the best, and one reason is precisely because a
<BR>
welfare system generally depends on rather steep levels of taxation which in
<BR>
turn often discourage innovation.
<BR>
<P>For reasons having mainly to do with the ease of collection, many taxing
<BR>
authorities have adopted some form of income tax or value added tax (VAT).
<BR>
Both of these tax transactions between persons (either flesh and blood
<BR>
persons or legal entities such as corporations).  Both of these taxes could
<BR>
theoretically be designed so that they didn't discourage innovation--for
<BR>
example by levying the VAT only against a few luxury consumer items, and by
<BR>
allowing a fairly high exemption for the income tax.  In practice, however,
<BR>
both forms of tax seem to inexorably expand.  The income tax is the more
<BR>
onerous of the two, particularly in times of inflation where a person must
<BR>
have a higher and higher income just to purchase the basic necessities.
<BR>
<P>The reason I say this discourages innovation is that it tends to preserve
<BR>
the staus quo.  This is intuitively obvious, and I've seen it operate time
<BR>
and time and time again when I was selling legal and accounting services to
<BR>
small businesses.  It's hard to start a business from scratch to begin with
<BR>
(especially if your product is something completely different)(from anything
<BR>
available before); doubly hard when half your net income's going for taxes
<BR>
(here I'm assuming that the entrepreneur hasn't quit his day job yet, thus
<BR>
has some positive income flow).
<BR>
<P>What are some of the other ways of maintaining a safety cushion that come to
<BR>
mind?  Voluntary insurance, for one.  I get pretty excited about some of the
<BR>
things I see certain ethnic groups doing--forming investments clubs, for
<BR>
example, which can act in part as a source of short term loans to get
<BR>
members over rough spots in &quot;this road we call life.&quot;  Personal savings
<BR>
accounts are another option, but more difficult, especially for someone
<BR>
young who's just starting out.  It might be a fruitful exercise for the
<BR>
people on this list to think of other ways.  I myself have always preferred
<BR>
to depend on my wits.  It gives me great peace of mind to know that, as long
<BR>
as I'm not greatly incapacitated by illness or injury, I can survive.
<BR>
There's also human kindness which, sadly, doesn't seem to figure much in
<BR>
people's plans these days.  Over the span of my life, people have mostly
<BR>
been kind to me and picked me up when I needed picking up.  I think maybe
<BR>
when you look for the kindness in people you almost always find it.  I even
<BR>
got to be friends with some of the kids in the gangs (mostly I had to side
<BR>
with the Latin Kings over the Bros since I lived in a mostly Mexican area)(I
<BR>
think maybe the &quot;PC&quot; term is hispanic, but the people in that barrio and in
<BR>
this part of Texas in general refer to themselves as Mexicans or around the
<BR>
border sometimes as Tejanos) (Texas was part of Spain for almost 400 years
<BR>
until the Mexican Revolution, then part of Mexico until 1836 when the
<BR>
Republic of Texas won independence)
<BR>
<P>There are two uses for public welfare systems which I see as having a net
<BR>
positive effect:  one is to support parents of young children; the second is
<BR>
to support people who are incapacitated by illness or injury.  I don't think
<BR>
either of these would work very well unless they're administered at a very
<BR>
local level where everyone knows almost everyone else at least by name if
<BR>
not personally (groups of, say, 1000 people or fewer).
<BR>
<P>Bonnie
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P><P><EM>&gt; I'd be paying less tax. But I'd be far less innovative.
