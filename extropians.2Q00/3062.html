<EM>&gt; Not really, look at your own immune system, running around checking

<EM>&gt; the state of all the cells in your body.  They are usually able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; police the neighborhood fairly effectively and only consume several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; percent of the resources available to you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, look at the immune system.  The immune system has the resources of
<BR>
the complete human body behind it.  It uses what amounts to controlled,
<BR>
directed evolution to evolve sophisticated antibodies.  And yet many
<BR>
infections get a hell of a lot farther than the &quot;hot-spot&quot; stage before
<BR>
being eradicated.  And people still die of infections.  Complex
<BR>
organisms with millions of years of evolution behind them, using
<BR>
controlled evolution to create new responses instead of relying on a
<BR>
fixed set, are routinely fought to a standstill or beaten by bacteria. 
<BR>
No, this is not a good thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So diamond is 10x stronger than steel,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that just means your missles have to have 10x larger expolosive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yield to produce equivalent damage to a diamondoid jet vs. a steel jet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The U.S. already makes the best jets in the world, with some competition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the Russians.  So what is the point of funding large efforts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to make nanotech jets?  Given the computational capacity that nanotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will allow you to put into missiles, I question whether jets are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; viable weapons *at all* in a nanotech era.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, they're terribly viable weapons if *you've* got them and the enemy
<BR>
*doesn't*.  So, diamond is 10x stronger than steel... that means your
<BR>
jet might be light enough for you to *outrun* non-diamondoid missiles. 
<BR>
Or launch small but incredibly fast and explosive countermissiles guided
<BR>
by nanocomputers.  And so on.  Do you really think that nanotech
<BR>
implementations of conventional weaponry would not be crushingly more
<BR>
powerful than the conventional weaponry of an unarmed opponent?  Such an
<BR>
opponent might be, in effect, &quot;unarmed&quot; indeed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; followed by saturation launches of vat-grown nuclear weapons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem with nuclear weapons is you *still* need the uranium.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robert has told me that Gina has a copy of a paper he did that says
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;mining&quot; gold using nanotech may be prohibitively expensive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mining uranium may be even worse.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I think the last time the Extropians list went through this I
<BR>
made a proposal for inexpensively creating fusion weapons.  I don't
<BR>
think I'll repeat it.  But you get the point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To grow nuclear weapons you are going need (a) fuel and (b)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rad-hardened nanotech.  I seem to recall that during the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development of the A-bomb we lost at least one scientist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at Los Alamos because he picked up a hunk of plutonium to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevent an accident.  What makes you think nanotech can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work in that environment?  Nuclear fission works by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the release of neutrons, a kg of fissionable material
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; releases a lot of neutrons and doesn't matter *what*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the nearby material is, it is going to sustain damage.
</EM><BR>
<P>If flesh and steel can construct nuclear weapons, so can nanotech.  If
<BR>
nanotech can withstand solar radiation for a year, it can withstand
<BR>
uranium for an hour.  If nanotech can function with sufficient
<BR>
non-fragility to be debugged, the finished product can function despite
<BR>
substantial amounts of radiation damage.  
<BR>
<P>I mean, okay, &quot;rad-hardened&quot; nanotech.  Why is this at all difficult? 
<BR>
Getting from sol-hardened to nuke-hardened strikes me as being a lot
<BR>
less difficult than getting from zero to sol-hardened.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; We'd have to get through that without blowing ourselves up before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we'd get the chance to dust the biosphere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We have enough nuclear and bioweapons today to blow ourselves up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and we aren't doing it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  Why?
<BR>
<P>1)  MAD works when exactly two (2) sides have the weapons.  (It's a good
<BR>
thing that the Evil Empire has disintegrated, leaving thousands of
<BR>
nuclear weapons in the totally trustworthy hands of a dozen bankrupt and
<BR>
corrupt ministates.  It makes me feel so much safer.)
<BR>
2)  MAD also requires time to spot the weapons coming in and launch a counterstrike.
<BR>
3)  Nuclear weapons aren't self-reproducing.  Getting a thousand nuclear
<BR>
weapons requires a lot more effort than getting one nuclear weapon,
<BR>
giving the opponent time to catch up and maintain the balance of terror.
<BR>
4)  There is no economic benefit, no positive side, to nuclear weapons. 
<BR>
Nuclear weapons can destroy a city, but not conquer it.
<BR>
5)  The last time there was a real war on this planet, the United States
<BR>
developed ultraweapons before anyone else, in secret, and used them
<BR>
against a non-nuclear enemy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You *MUST* make a credible situation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that someone will (a) get nanotech before anyone else; (b)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use it to develop advanced weapons; (c) grow such large quantities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of those weapons and train people to operate them (or create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;intelligent&quot; weapons) that they represent a threat; (d) do it all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without anyone realizing what is going on.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the simplest case, I only have to argue that Moscow will *think* such
<BR>
a situation is plausible and threaten to launch a first strike unless
<BR>
the US gives up nanotechnology development...
<BR>
<P>Heck, right now, Moscow is screaming because the US is talking about an
<BR>
ABM defense.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then after you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; met *all* of those critera, you have to present a case that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the threat would be so large and present itself so fast that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conventional weapons and tactics would be useless against it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Conventional weapons and tactics would be useless against a rain of the
<BR>
thousand nuclear missiles we have now, never mind ten thousand
<BR>
diamondoid ones.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Even if Freitas's paper is entirely true in every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; detail, it doesn't mean - as a policy conclusion - that there's a safe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; path to nanotechnology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But it is a first attempt to show that all of the &quot;crying wolf&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that people do *may* be crying at shadows on the wall rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real wolves.
</EM><BR>
<P>If so, I am not convinced.  I regard Freitas's paper as a useful
<BR>
delineation of some mathematics and battle tactics of nanotechnological
<BR>
warfare.  I saw nothing in it, at any point, that made me feel safe. 
<BR>
Anyone who gets a warm fuzzy feeling from reading Freitas's paper is
<BR>
deluding verself as severely as Neville Chamberlain.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You can't *prove* that we aren't going to be turned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into dust tomorrow by an asteroid we didn't see.  All you can do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is make reasonable estimates that its highly unlikely to occur.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is about the best we can do with nanotech as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (2)  The battle strategies depicted here aren't twisted enough to depict
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a real-life arms race.  Would military replibots really wait around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; passively to be swept up into neat little nets?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, but if you are busy avoiding being swept up that is likely to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; put a significant restriction on reproductive efforts.  The nets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could simple herd the bad-bots into an area where they exhaust the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources and as a result are forced to stop replicating.
</EM><BR>
<P>The bad-bots don't cut through the nets?  Eat the nets?  Sweep the
<BR>
goodbots into nets?  Change their external configuration to look like
<BR>
goodbots?  And so on.  I'm not the one to run this argument, because I'm
<BR>
not a nanotechnologist.  Right now, it does look to me like there's a
<BR>
distinct tendency on the part of the &quot;nanodoves&quot; to assume that, once
<BR>
you have presented a means whereby the defense can overcome offense,
<BR>
you've won the argument.  You don't go on to ask:  &quot;How would I go on to
<BR>
outwit this defense?&quot;  Presenting a scenario in which defensive nets
<BR>
sweep up the bad guys is not an argument.
<BR>
<P>I mean, for accidental grey goo, it's a great argument.  Don't get me
<BR>
wrong.  But for military-grade nanotech, this is rather like saying that
<BR>
tanks will never be important on the battlefield because the defensive
<BR>
tanks could take a big net and sweep up all the offensive tanks into a
<BR>
neat little bag.  You can always give an example of defense overpowering
<BR>
offense.  I can always give an example of offense overpowering defense. 
<BR>
What matters are the overall technological forces determining who wins. 
<BR>
I see three major forces:
<BR>
<P>1)  Offensive bots need to reproduce.  Defensive bots don't need to
<BR>
reproduce, and assuming early detection, will always outnumber the
<BR>
offensive bots.
<BR>
2)  Defending against an attack requires considerably greater technical
<BR>
sophistication than the attack itself.
<BR>
3)  An offender can use scorched-earth strategies that are closed to the defender.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; [snip] and can scan or alter every byte of RAM; are we really supposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to win a cracker's war in physical reality?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It depends how important it is to you.  We don't have good computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; security now because it is too much trouble for humans to remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3 passwords.  However we do have retina and fingerprint recognition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; devices coming that will make it *very* hard to gain improper access.
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you ever read anything from Cult of the Dead Cow?  Actually, you
<BR>
probably have.  There's one fascinating article that describes how you
<BR>
can take over a computer if someone is copying a C string to memory
<BR>
allocated on the stack without checking the C string's length; you
<BR>
overwrite the stack's return address to go to a place in ROM that will
<BR>
execute the rest of the program that you sent in the C string. 
<BR>
(Actually, because the C string is zero-terminated, you can't use a zero
<BR>
byte in the program, so you have to send the program as a
<BR>
ones-compliment version, then send the return address to a place in the
<BR>
ROM that will take the ones-compliment or subtract 0x80 or whatever and
<BR>
*then* execute the program.)
<BR>
<P>No password required.  No retina required.  I wasn't talking about
<BR>
attacks against the password.  I was talking about the kind of deeply
<BR>
codic attacks invented by crackers who might call themselves &quot;hackers&quot;
<BR>
and be worthy of the name.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The *reason* most medical procedures are so expensive is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you have to do almost everything possible to avoid killing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patient.  Most computer systems can't &quot;kill&quot; their users and so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; security failures are tolerated.
</EM><BR>
<P>So what you're saying is that perfect security is achievable, we just
<BR>
aren't trying hard enough?  I do not believe this to be the case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; (3)  Assuming that a single radiation strike produces device failure is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; conservative when arguing a proof-of-possibility that nanomachines can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be constructed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can solve this very simply.  Researchers at Berkeley discuss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a high energy cesium ion source that can deliver 0.4 Amps of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ions in 0.37 microsecond pulses (delivering 400 trillion watts).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any nanotech in this beam is converted to *slag*.  If you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotech has active electrostatic or magnetic defenses, you just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; convert the beam to neutrons as is done in the Berkeley
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rotating Neutron Source.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I was objecting to Robert Freitas using the one-point-of-failure
<BR>
assumption to argue that aerovores would require large opaque shields
<BR>
(which would slow down the reproduction rate).  I wasn't saying that
<BR>
aerovores would be immune to energy weapons.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Why call attention to ourselves now, risking a media brouhaha and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ban on all nanotechnology?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A ban will not work.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the long run, no.  But it could very easily delay nanotech
<BR>
development in the US until it's too late.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You can't regulate small technologies that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be constructed from relatively abundant materials.
</EM><BR>
<P>You can throw Jim von Ehr in jail.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you ban AFM construction?  Ok, lets regulate the sale of all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; peizoelectric crystals.  Hmmm, doesn't that mean I have to ban
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sale of all elements from which those crystals can be grown?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Right!
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me get this straight:  You're saying that the good guys can detect
<BR>
particles the size of a microbe in every bird, bee, and mudhole on the
<BR>
planet, but our modern government can't find a back-alley peizoelectric
<BR>
lab?  Okay.  I can maybe accept this.  But I don't buy illegal
<BR>
back-alley nanotechnology startups and covert NSF grants.  If the
<BR>
government shut down all currently operating labs and put all current
<BR>
nanotechnology researchers and Foresight members and sci.nanotech
<BR>
posters under surveilance, nanotechnology in the US would be effectively over.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; By the time global ecophagy is a real threat, everyone will have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; screaming about diamondoid fighter jets for the last year, and there'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be moratoriums all over the place.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why?  If the nations of the free world see this coming, the probability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be that they all will have diamondoid fighter jets within a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years of each other.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;A few years?&quot;  A heck of a lot can happen in a few years!  If the USSR
<BR>
had developed nukes &quot;a few years&quot; before the US, instead of vice versa,
<BR>
there would have been hell to pay.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You don't think the EU or China or Russia is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to sit by twidling their thumbs while the U.S. develops
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this technology do you?  Technology is technology, the economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantages benefits of the technology used &quot;properly&quot; are very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clear, so the development is likely to occur at relatively similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rates around the world (in the more developed nations).
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you give me *any* historic incidence of anything *remotely* like
<BR>
this scenario developing?  Even taking nuclear weapons as the model
<BR>
might be too conservative.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; A non-governmental-organization (i.e. Foresight) publishing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; voluntary guidelines is good enough for the immediate memetic effect,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; too; you just say, in a heavy, serious tone of voice:  &quot;The Foresight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Guidelines explicitly prohibit the development of replicators which can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; operate in a biological environment; furthermore, the Foresight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Guidelines require that even vat replicators use a broadcast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; architecture...&quot; and so on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You want to go further than that, you want to make people aware that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is a serious problem,
</EM><BR>
<P>Why?  What's the value-added for Them becoming aware that military-grade
<BR>
nano is a serious problem *now*, rather than later (but still before
<BR>
it's an actual problem)?
<BR>
<P>Do you think the government would have allowed the development of the
<BR>
Internet if the MPAA (or whatever the music industry calls itself) had
<BR>
known about MP3s twenty years in advance?  If Barnes and Noble had known
<BR>
about Amazon?  If Clinton had known about the McCain campaign?  If the
<BR>
saddle industry had known about Ford?  Progress only happens because the
<BR>
government and special interest groups don't become aware of it until
<BR>
it's too late.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but one that can be defended against with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a safety level that corresponds to your investment in sensors and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defensive devices.  Wouldn't it be better to put into place (legally,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on a global basis) things like the NIH guidelines that work to prevent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accidents or the bio/chemical weapons treaties that managed to begin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; putting the bad-genies back into the bottle shortly after it got out.
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be a good idea to have NIHoid guidelines in place *after* the
<BR>
civilian benefits of nanotech become clear, *after* there are special
<BR>
interest groups *defending* nanotech, but *before* ecophages became possible.
