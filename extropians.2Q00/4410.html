[random example hoping to spawn another string : StarTrek, The Next

Generation. I loved that show as a kid- - best thing on TV and probably one 
<BR>
of the impetuses behind my latent technophilia. But, looking back with my 
<BR>
modest, but larger, scientific knowledge, I'm appalled! If I'm hurling 
<BR>
through interstellar space in 4 CENTURIES on a giant hunk of composite 
<BR>
metals in a smelly primate shell with wonders such as &quot;nanites&quot; that serve 
<BR>
no useful function, an onboard computer AIthat's really only got the &quot;A&quot; 
<BR>
part down, and &quot;diplomatic missions&quot; to colonies of other skin bags,there's 
<BR>
gonna be hell to pay!]
<BR>

<BR>
<P>It's not just improved scientific knowledge you have, but vision of what the 
<BR>
future could actually be like.  I would love to have seen an episode (future 
<BR>
Voyager epsisode or film plot?) where the Federation encountered a very 
<BR>
powerful race of &quot;good&quot; borg that followed extropian ideals in their 
<BR>
culture.
<BR>
<P>Picard has the job of telling them on a diplomatic mission, &quot;please stay out 
<BR>
of Federation space because we don't go for genetic engineering to improve 
<BR>
ourselves and also limit AI and nanotech within our society!&quot;  &quot;You will 
<BR>
pollute the minds of Federation members with ideas and technologies that 
<BR>
could tear us apart!&quot;
<BR>
<P>Being that the &quot;good&quot; extropian borg had a decentralized society, some of 
<BR>
it's members decide to go against Federation wishes which they consider 
<BR>
stasist and covertly expose some Federation members to what is possible.  
<BR>
This would create the conflict for the story.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;good&quot; borg could even be written as the &quot;Federation&quot; from an alternate 
<BR>
universe where things developed in a very different way.  If only I were a 
<BR>
scriptwriter!
<BR>
<P>It's nice to be back online at home, and with a cable connection too.  The 
<BR>
effort getting it connected is another story...
<BR>
<P>I have spent the last two days pouring over extro digests to try and catch 
<BR>
up.  So many great posts and nuggets of information.  I missed you folks 
<BR>
alot.
<BR>
<P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
