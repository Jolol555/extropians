<EM>&gt;...In my case, MVT offers a solution to the hard/ mind problem in philosophy,

<EM>&gt;which reduces all the second-order theorising and &quot;made-up names&quot; that

<EM>&gt;problems, not solve them ... it simply isn't in their interest to shorten

<P>It seems to me that you *are* playing in the academic game, even if you
<BR>
don't realize it.   Academia has succeeded across many centuries as remaining
<BR>
the most authoritative source people turn to when asking abstract questions.
<BR>
You can see this by seeing who reporters ask, or policy makers ask, when they
<BR>
want to ask a question about an area they don't know very well.   And you
<BR>
can see by who people give money to in order to help abstract questions get
<BR>
better answered.  Although we might think we see lots of inefficiencies in
<BR>
how it works, we must acknowledge that it has so far beat most competitors
<BR>
hands down in the niche it competes for.
<BR>
<P>If you are trying to convince the world you have a better approach to the
<BR>
mind body question, you are most certainly competing most directly with
<BR>
academics.  You may be choosing a different strategy from they, but you
<BR>
are playing the same game: convincing people you are an authority on an
<BR>
abstract topic.
