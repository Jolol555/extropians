<EM>&gt; affordable but he has had no takers.  When trying to do this in the

<EM>&gt; aerospace sector a Boeing v.p. told him &quot;we just don't see a large market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for aircars!&quot; lol!!
</EM><BR>
<P>Why do you suppose that is John?  I would offer two possible reasons:
<BR>
the Moller aircar makes so much noise as to be illegal with 1000 meters
<BR>
of anything, and secondly it would need to devour fuel at such a prodigious
<BR>
rate as to make it too expensive to operate for any practical purpose.
<BR>
<P>These are speculations only, based on my back of the envelope calcs.
<BR>
If these are wrong, however, I definitely want an aircar.  {8^D  spike
