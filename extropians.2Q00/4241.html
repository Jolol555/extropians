<EM>&gt;  &gt; Anyway, what you are describing is not the kind of paradox people keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; going on about. It seems like whenever talk of FTL communications comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; up, people start spouting off about the future, the past, paradoxes, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Just seems silly to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The reason is that when you have FTL communication, you can reverse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the order of cause and effect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An &quot;event&quot; in special relativity specifies a position and a time.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interval between two events A and B is called &quot;timelike&quot; if you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get from A to B going slower than the speed of light; &quot;spacelike&quot; if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you would have to go faster than the speed of light; and &quot;lightlike&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you would have to go at exactly the speed of light.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For timelike and lightlike intervals, absolute ordering is preserved in all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reference frames; that is, if A happens before B in one frame, A will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happen before B in all frames.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For spacelike intervals, that is not the case.  One person may see A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happening before B; another person zipping by in a spaceship going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another direction might see B happen before A.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now if you can travel from A to B, or even transmit information from A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to B, and A and B are spacelike-separated, you have a problem.  Send a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signal from A to B, and some observers will see people at B receiving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the signal (and acting on it) _before_ it was sent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The book _Spacetime Physics_ by Taylor and Wheeler is probably a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty good introduction to this stuff.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well this is what I am getting at: in these &quot;paradoxes&quot; that I keep
<BR>
hearing about, and that you describe above, all that is really going
<BR>
on is that someone may have quicker knowledge (i.e. see an event happen)
<BR>
before someone else who is relying on normal light (travelling at normal
<BR>
lightspeed) to see the event. But the event already happened long ago.
<BR>
<P>What I mean is the difference between someone watching a moon landing
<BR>
in 1969 on TV vs. someone watching it on Alpha Centauri many years later.
<BR>
In either case there is a delay, and even if you had instant (FTL) TV
<BR>
signals from the moon to your TV in 1969 there still is no way that I
<BR>
see that you actually are going &quot;back in time&quot; or causing any kind of
<BR>
paradox.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps if you explained it in terms of TV I would understand ? :-)
<BR>
<P>So what if someone sees me react to something that for them hasn't
<BR>
even been transmitted yet? They just need a faster TV connection!
<BR>
There is no reversal of cause and effect though. Once an event has
<BR>
happened (say a car wreck), there is no way to make it not happen.
<BR>
In my uneducated opinion :-)
