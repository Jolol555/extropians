<EM>&gt;      &gt;I can perceived the thoughts of the original &quot;me&quot;.  I cannot
</EM><BR>
perceive the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;thoughts of the new &quot;me&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course you can, you're both thinking the same thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Having two people think the same thing is different then having one person
<BR>
perceive the thoughts of the other person.  If they thought different
<BR>
things, would one copy perceive the thought from the other through
<BR>
telepathy?  I think not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;I can control the actions of the original &quot;me&quot;.  I cannot control the
</EM><BR>
actions
<BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;of the new &quot;me&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course you can, you scratch your nose and you see the copy scratch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his nose. Sooner or later (usually sooner) a random quantum fluctuation
</EM><BR>
will
<BR>
<EM>&gt; happen or one of you will see or hear something the other does not and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two of you will diverge, but until then the two bodies will move and think
</EM><BR>
in sync.
<BR>
<P>The very fact that they diverge seems to indicate that one consciousness is
<BR>
not controlling both.  They are clearly two separate consciousnesses which
<BR>
will go their separate ways.  They fact that they were synchronized to
<BR>
appear identical for an instant does not mean that they were one
<BR>
consciousness in two bodies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;      &gt; Not only can I easily tell the difference between the old and new
</EM><BR>
&quot;me's&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course you can't.
</EM><BR>
<P>Normal humans can tell what body their in.  They don't accidentally feed the
<BR>
wrong body at mealtime because they can't tell the difference.  Even
<BR>
identical bodies would not have this problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;      &gt;I could never get them confused.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course you can. I  put you two in a symmetrical environment and have a
</EM><BR>
switch
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that swaps the input sense data that originated in one body and send it to
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; other brain. You can't tell when I throw the switch. I have another magic
</EM><BR>
gadget
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that can instantly remove the brain from one body and put it into the
</EM><BR>
other.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; You can't tell when I throw that switch either and neither can the other
</EM><BR>
fellow,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; except that there isn't really another fellow, there is only you.
</EM><BR>
<P>I stand corrected.  It might be possible to confuse me with enough sensory
<BR>
input and magic brain teleportation.  Simply having a duplicated body with
<BR>
duplicated thoughts is not enough.  If you did have a magic teleporter that
<BR>
swapped brains and bodies, I would gladly teleport my brain into a copy's
<BR>
body and have no qualms that I had really been transferred to a new body.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;The  original &quot;me&quot; is always here and is never disconnected.  The new
</EM><BR>
&quot;me&quot; is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;over there, it is never connected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know what that means.
</EM><BR>
<P>This was similar to your device of rerouting sensory data from one body to
<BR>
another.  Normally, only one body is connected to one brain.  Each brain can
<BR>
tell which body is connected and which is not.  This is how the copies
<BR>
themselves can tell the difference.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All the proposed mechanisms (except one) that attempt to identify the
</EM><BR>
cause of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; this huge change, like something special about my atoms or something
</EM><BR>
special about
<BR>
<EM>&gt; my position have been shown to be invalid, &quot;the original&quot; and &quot;the copy&quot;
</EM><BR>
are not well
<BR>
<EM>&gt; defined concepts nor can they be used as distinct categories without
</EM><BR>
inconsistencies,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and the vague psycho-babble explanations for all this are so bad they're
</EM><BR>
not even wrong.
<BR>
<P>I don't know what change you are referencing here.  What changed?  From what
<BR>
to what?
<BR>
<P>I think you are misunderstanding my point.  I don't claim that the copies
<BR>
can tell which is the &quot;original&quot; and which is the &quot;copy&quot;.  I claim that each
<BR>
copy can tell which is &quot;their&quot; body or consciousness and which is the
<BR>
&quot;other&quot; body and consciousness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's time to stop dancing around the issue, if you take it as an axiom
</EM><BR>
that the original and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the copy are somehow different, and admittedly most do, then there is only
</EM><BR>
one
<BR>
<EM>&gt; conclusion, the religious people are right after all and we have a soul
</EM><BR>
undetectable by
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the scientific method.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I think you have misunderstood my point.  I do not claim that the
<BR>
copies are different.  I claim that they are separate.  They can act
<BR>
differently or experience different things.  This is scientifically obvious
<BR>
if they have separate bodies and separate brains that are not physically
<BR>
wired together.  None of the irrational points you mentioned above are part
<BR>
of my position.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Obviously I can't prove (by the scientific method) that's wrong but I'm
</EM><BR>
just not ready
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to surrender to the irrational.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, your position seems to be more irrational to me.  Your claim that
<BR>
the copy and the original are &quot;one&quot; is semi-mystical and semi-unscientific.
<BR>
It implies thought communication between disconnected brains with no
<BR>
scientific rationale.  It requires exact duplicate environments.  It doesn't
<BR>
work if quantam differences make duplicate environments impossible.  It only
<BR>
lasts for a brief period of time before the copies diverge.  No one can
<BR>
interact with either copy, or they will diverge.  The copy must have an
<BR>
identical (not upgraded, superior or younger) body, thereby losing the point
<BR>
of uploading.
<BR>
<P>In summary, even if your carefully controlled example were possible, it is
<BR>
so temporary, so useless for uploading, and so far removed from probable
<BR>
upload scenarios, that I view this as a mental exercise only.  I'm not sure
<BR>
what effect your claims could have on actual copying or uploading events.
