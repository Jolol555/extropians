<EM>&gt; The only reason corporations can't use violence is because there's

<EM>&gt; someone bigger and nastier who won't let them. Under anarcho

<EM>&gt; capitalism there would be no such constraint, in which case they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free to detonate and maim to whatever extent the benefits outweigh the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PR costs. Would people boycott a company that assassinated it's rivals?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe, but the same people keep reelecting politicians who advocate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; similar solutions to perceived domestic and foreign problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know. That's why I'm a minarchist, not an anarchist. But Phil calls
<BR>
himself an anarcho-capitalist, which is why I was asking about the apaprent
<BR>
conflict between *their* economic theory and his expressed views.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You're drawing a false dichotomy here - either markets are perfect, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which case they should never be regulated, or regulation is superior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and everything should be decided from the top down. Why can't the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; optimum be a mix of the two? I think there are instances where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regulation can improve the functioning of a market. It does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; logically follow that I think government ought to be deciding how many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bars of soap get manufactured.
</EM><BR>
<P>Doesn't it? The question at issue is what is the best general-purpose
<BR>
mechanism for making economic decisions. Either a central comittee works
<BR>
better than a free market, or vice versa. Once you've figured out which
<BR>
method works best, it doesn't make sense to switch to the other one whenever
<BR>
things don't seem perfect - the tough decisions are definitely NOT the ones
<BR>
you want to leave to the inferior mechanism.
<BR>
<P>I suppose you might argue that different methods work better for different
<BR>
kinds of decisions, but that's a different issue.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Free markets work, in general, very well indeed - that doesn't mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there aren't situations when they don't. Who 'ought to do well' is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; function of what you're trying to optimize.
</EM><BR>
<P>And who decides what parameters should be optimized? Statists think that the
<BR>
government should decide, 'for the good of everyone'. Phil aparently thinks
<BR>
that his personal opinions are the best guide. I think the best approach is
<BR>
to let each individual decide what is important to him - the overall result
<BR>
of millions of individual decisions will do a much better job of getting
<BR>
each individual what they want than and single decision could.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then government is optimal. Model the historical evolution of top-down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control as a bottom-up market process and the aggregate result of billions
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; locally  rational, self-interested decisions. If you don't think the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political/economic system won the market, you're just another mistaken
</EM><BR>
expert
<BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to out-guess the emergent result.
</EM><BR>
<P>LOL.
<BR>
<P>This is one of the places where I think anarchists are a bit clueless. A
<BR>
market can operate only in the absence of force. It works only because all
<BR>
of the decisions made by the participants are voluntary, and each
<BR>
participant makes local trade-offs in the way that best suits his own
<BR>
desires. The moment you introduce actors that have the ability to compel
<BR>
others to do things at gunpoint, this is no longer the case. Instead of
<BR>
evolving in the direction of satisfying the desires of all participants, the
<BR>
system then evolves to satisfy the desires of those who have access to force
<BR>
at the expense of those who do not.
