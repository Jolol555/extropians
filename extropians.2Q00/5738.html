<EM>&gt; &gt;First of all, Psychology tell us that few criminals have an interest in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;killing others without a cause. The cause could be money. If the victim is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;unarmed, killing is not necessary, threatening with a weapon usually is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;enough. 
</EM><BR>
<P>As I've stated before, this is not the case here in the US. Criminals here
<BR>
prefer to shoot you and any other witnesses to prevent you from testifying
<BR>
against them. They put a higher value on your stuff than on your life, which is
<BR>
why we have kids killing other kids for a pair of Nike sneakers. Its also been
<BR>
conclusively shown that you have a 30% greater chance of surviving an armed
<BR>
encounter if you are armed with a gun than if not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;In Germany we have a very low rate of Murder, with 381 cases of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;murder. There were a total of 12.448 cases of weapons usage only as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;threat. So you could say that we have a very, very low rate of crimes with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;actual wepaons usage. The crime rate in the US is quite different: 1998 ther
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;were 14088 cases of murder.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I may be having a bad math morning, however considering the differing sizes of the populations the numbers don't appear to be that dramatically different.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Germany 1999 est. population 82,087,361
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US 1999 est. Population 272,639,608
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (the above from the CIA WorldFact Book)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given the substantially larger population in the U.S. the Substantially Larger number of murders appears to be roughly on par with the murder rate in Germany.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, Germany does have a much lower incidence. However, I notice he only
<BR>
said murder. What about manslaughter and other forms of illegal homicide? Also,
<BR>
what are the property crime rates? I notice you left those out, as well as other
<BR>
violent crime, including non-gun violent crime, like rape, assault,
<BR>
manslaughter, negligent homicide, etc. What are the rates of burglary, robbery,
<BR>
larceny and car theft?
<BR>
<P>As I've repeatedly said, comparing the US average murder rate to a european
<BR>
average is meaningless because the gun laws vary so widely from state to state,
<BR>
and those states with the most gun control have the highest rates. If you
<BR>
divided US states up between those with strict gun control, and those with
<BR>
liberal gun laws, then do your comparison, you will find that the controlling
<BR>
states are the greatest contributors to the overall US crime rate.
<BR>
<P>Claiming that only states with big cities have high crime is incorrect, as there
<BR>
are plenty of big cities with liberal gun laws in states with liberal gun laws
<BR>
that have low crime rates. Another thing you can do is look at counties of
<BR>
similar size and area, that are part of the metro area of a big city, but are in
<BR>
different states with different gun laws. You can compare Rockingham County, in
<BR>
New Hapmshire and Middlesex County in Massachusetts, for example, or counties in
<BR>
Virginia and Maryland that surround Washington DC, or counties in Missouri and
<BR>
Kansas surrounding Kansas City...
