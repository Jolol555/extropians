<P><EM>&gt; Brian: I'm not finding this discussion productive, and you seem also to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find our respective views too far apart to want to continue, so I'm going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to try to discontinue this discussion by keeping this response brief.
</EM><BR>
<P>Same with my response -- actually, mostly I just want to correct
<BR>
something at the end, but a few comments first.
<BR>
<P>(For the record, it isn't so much that our views are far apart,
<BR>
it has more to do with the &quot;far apartness&quot; of our communicative
<BR>
styles. I love trying to bridge wide gaps between my views and
<BR>
someone else's, when that person is willing, and when
<BR>
communication isn't utterly painful.)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I will comment on your left-right point, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to say that I found your Bush example only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reinforces my point about the uselessness of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left-right division.
</EM><BR>
<P>No. It reinforces the incompleteness of it. You seem to think
<BR>
its incompleteness is a sufficient argument, or nearly so, for
<BR>
its uselessness. This is odd, since no conceptual category is
<BR>
ever complete (even the &quot;Absolute,&quot; as those wacky French
<BR>
Hegelians would argue).
<BR>
<P>Further, you misunderstood the point of the Bush example (though
<BR>
I didn't spell it out well). It does not simply revolve around
<BR>
fiscal matters, it is a point about one's identification with
<BR>
society, and with the government that is of and by that society.
<BR>
<P>[....]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It would make far better sense to say that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extropians favor decentralized, market-based,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voluntaristic, emergent-order solutions to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social coordination issues than centrally-imposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solutions. That's much more specific and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; informative than &quot;right-wing&quot;. There are many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people and groups described as right-wing who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; favor centralized control in numerous situations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, of course, IF my goal were to characterize Extropians in as
<BR>
economical a way as possible. This was NOT my goal, however, as
<BR>
I thought I made clear, repeatedly. I've been interested in
<BR>
capturing an essential part of Extropianism that isn't
<BR>
sufficiently emphasized in discussions about Extropianism
<BR>
(indeed: seems incorrectly _minimized_), and the existence of
<BR>
which poses some interesting sociological and political
<BR>
questions.
<BR>
<P>Draw a circle. Call it &quot;Extropians.&quot; Draw a circle called
<BR>
&quot;Right-wing people&quot; (in the sense of individualistic, as I meant
<BR>
to convey with my Bush example). The Right-wing circle engulfs
<BR>
the Extropian circle pretty much completely, even if there are
<BR>
HUGE parts of the Right-wing circle that are outside the
<BR>
Extropian circle. (I'm aware that there are a few people who
<BR>
consider themselves leftists and also quasi-Extropian, but there
<BR>
number is tiny, to the point where they're outliers.)
<BR>
<P>To spell this out in more detail, I'd need to do a lot more
<BR>
work, of course. For one: explain the difference between society
<BR>
and government, and the respective differences in the way that
<BR>
libertarians, and non-libertarian right-wingers view the
<BR>
relationship of society to government. I think the case can be
<BR>
made that libertarians and Christian right-wingers have a lot in
<BR>
common with respect to their view of the relation of the
<BR>
individual to society, but differ as to the role of government
<BR>
intervention. (Actually, a more local unit of social grouping
<BR>
would have to be brought in as well: the community.)
<BR>
<P>But that's a long, long story that probably isn't worth
<BR>
addressing.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt; Hm.... this discussion probably isn't worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; continuing much further.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Agreed. You think the individuals you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communicated with had &quot;irrational&quot; (not just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mistaken) views about circumcision. I did not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; participate in those discussions and so will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say anything more about this. It hardly seems of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much relevance to transhumanists.
</EM><BR>
<P>? Circumcision certainly is not relevant to X-humanists (afai
<BR>
can see), but anti-Semitism would be, which all that's in
<BR>
question, yes?
<BR>
<P>About &quot;irrational&quot;: if someone who doesn't seem mentally or
<BR>
educationally deficient says something incorrect, when it's
<BR>
clear that the person has looked at evidence which clearly
<BR>
points in a different direction than their conclusion, they are
<BR>
not being rational.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;You don't seem &quot;to have ears&quot; for this discusion (to speak
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Nietzschean). So I think I'll stop here.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Accusing me of being unwilling to listen is pointless.
</EM><BR>
<P>Goodness! Not what I'm doing at all. Max, a quick memory scan
<BR>
tells me you've quoted Nietzsche several times in the last two
<BR>
or so months alone. Further, I recall your having a lengthy
<BR>
quote from _Zarathustra_ on one of your Web pages several years
<BR>
ago (about the Übermensch, I think). Thus, it didn't seem
<BR>
unreasonable of me to assume -- incorrectly, it has turned out
<BR>
-- that you've read enough Nietzsche to know what &quot;having ears
<BR>
for a something&quot; means. In fact, the metaphor occurs in various
<BR>
forms several times in _Zarathustra_ alone. It has NOTHING to do
<BR>
with willingness to listen, or with intelligence. Rather, it's a
<BR>
question of being &quot;tuned&quot; in the appropriate way, which is a
<BR>
matter beyond rational accessibility (Nietzsche's point in using
<BR>
this, and similar, metaphors). All I meant was: you and I are
<BR>
from different subcultures. Sorry if my assumption was
<BR>
unreasonable (or if there's another reasonable interpretation of
<BR>
hte Nietzsche metaphor, which I can't see, but I might have
<BR>
missed it!).
<BR>
<P>You picked Churchland as the UCSD philosopher youl wanted to
<BR>
work with. I picked Pippin. That might some it up best.
<BR>
Different worlds. We might need a better universal translator.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I could do the same to you. It won't get us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anywhere, so I will not do so. Some of your other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comments seem unnecessarily inflammatory, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I refuse to be inflamed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Max, please check your assumptions, per the Nietzsche ex.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If we are to discuss political and economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; differences among transhumanists, why not take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the emphasis away from general criticisms and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead ask which specific policies and procedures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will best further our shared trans-humanist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goals while respecting our personal values?
</EM><BR>
<P>Because:
<BR>
1) I don't accept the relevance of any distinction between
<BR>
personal values and specific policies;
<BR>
2) I think general criticisms are extremely healthy for any
<BR>
group, especially a new and growing one;
<BR>
3) I find the questions interesting, and the exploration thereof
<BR>
extremely illuminating; and
<BR>
4) I think general criticisms -- if they are received
<BR>
open-mindedly -- are likely to have an extremely beneficial
<BR>
effect precisely on the formation of policies and procedures.
<BR>
<P>I'm disappointed that you've responded in such an uncharitable
<BR>
way to my criticisms (though I can blame myself, partly, for
<BR>
setting the tone initially, corrected though the content shortly
<BR>
thereafter was). But I know very few people who respond to
<BR>
criticism well (these few don't include myself).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Onward!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Max
</EM><BR>
<P>Inward! :)
