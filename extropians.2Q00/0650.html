<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Literally by your intepretation, yes, however the US has never brought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;an anti-trust suit against a foreign company.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Wrong again.  The US sues foreign companies *all the time* under the Sherman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Act.  The first time it was done successfully was way back in 1945 in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; case of US v. Alcoa (148 F.2d 416).  Alcoa was a Canadian corporation which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; was sued for acts committed *entirely* outside the borders of the US.  As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; long as your business has a sufficient impact on trade in the US, it simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doesn't matter where you are based or where you do business.  There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; really no dispute about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alcoa: ALuminum COmpany of America..... hardly Canadian.
</EM><BR>
<P>Morover, ALCOA (Aluminum Company of America) was sued because it had obtained a
<BR>
total lock on all aluminum mines in Canada of any consequence. As that was the
<BR>
only supplier of a strategic resource metal to our refineries on the Columbia
<BR>
River, and its primary customer was the US Gov't, it was obviously a quite
<BR>
different situation. Since that was 1945, you might remember that we happened to
<BR>
be at war at the time, and aluminum was necessary for airplane manufacturing.
<BR>
ALCOA executives were also convicted of war profiteering....
