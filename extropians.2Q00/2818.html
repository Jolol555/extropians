<P>&lt;&lt; This is not what life is supposed to be about, dammit. The next wake I
<BR>
&nbsp;attend for an extropian had better the hell involve a bottle of liquid
<BR>
&nbsp;nitrogen. I want to say &quot;See you sometime again.&quot; rather than &quot;good bye
<BR>
&nbsp;forever my freind.&quot;

A time of grief is not a great to remind folks that cryogenics is not an 
<BR>
absolute, but there, I said it. So many on this list are so absolutely 
<BR>
convinced that Alcor's way is the only way; rather then a currently promising 
<BR>
venue.  I keep thinking, since I have joined this mailing list, that so many 
<BR>
seem convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the Singularity (a techno form 
<BR>
of rapture?) will arrive in just a few decades, rather then centuries.
<BR>
<P>I humbly suggest that while everyone re-doubles their efforts to sign up with 
<BR>
Alcor, and invests and promotes nanotech to extend human life-spans and 
<BR>
relieve diseases; that greater effort also be placed into the area of 
<BR>
theories and concepts. In other words, more Tipler-like papers, more 
<BR>
Moravec-like papers, more Tegmark-like papers. Lets honor more then just the 
<BR>
memory of Sasha, and everyone else we have ever cared about and dedicate a 
<BR>
little bit more of our efforts into the fallacious notion of 'physics and 
<BR>
resurrection', and make this Fiction, become the Truth!  At least we and our 
<BR>
descendents will have all the time in the world to make this real.  Best to 
<BR>
Sasha's friends and family
