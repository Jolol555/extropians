<EM>&gt; &gt;sooo lame, no matter what decade you are in? Obviously this is because

<EM>&gt; It's not that simple, as ad agencies know. Lots of people choose to buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Potter books because (1) they're simple and entertaining (as evidenced by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the initial word-of-mouth break-out sales), (2) they're now massively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hyped, (3) they're everywhere, crowding all the alternatives off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shelves - since those who own the shelf space insist on it, and insist on
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; series of other inappropriate accounting measures that are killing
</EM><BR>

<P>I don't buy the &quot;its's the ads, all the ads fault&quot; theory. As you say,
<BR>
Hollywood or book publishers can pump ads out for bad product all they
<BR>
want, but it doesn't take off with the masses. They love what they love,
<BR>
ads may help get it rolling, but that's about it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; pulped, to the ceaseless toppling and replacement of publishers and
</EM><BR>
editors
<BR>
<EM>&gt; acting as if this were a rational process when actually it's a bizarre
</EM><BR>
crap
<BR>
<EM>&gt; shoot. Now that Potter is flavour of the year, I hear that every other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; publisher is rushing out clones - a series by Clive Barker, etc etc.
</EM><BR>
Anyone
<BR>
<EM>&gt; can see that this will tend to clog the market, but you keep following the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sheep until they all fall to their deaths, then do it all over again when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cowboy stories or nurse stories spontaneously emerge as slightly more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting than kid wizard books. It's monocropping, with all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; temporary benefits and finally fatal dangers of that stupid practice.

<EM>&gt; Meantime, species are going extinct (and I'm one of them, whine whine).

<P>Welcome to digital capitalism- die, survive, or thrive its your choice.
