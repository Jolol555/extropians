<EM>&gt; &gt; So, this interested me enough that I decided to do a little web
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; research.  Not much; I'm no expert.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; First off, I was struck by the claim that she didn't actually do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anything for those likely to survive her treatment.  While I was aware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the fact that she administered to the dying, I was also given to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; understand that she would feed the hungry, cure the sick, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I remember correctly, her order's assets at the time of her death
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were on the order of US $250M. She was used to being ferried around in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the executive jets of her friends -- who included some rather dubious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dictators.
</EM><BR>
<P>So she took advantage of the guilty offerings of rapscallions to try tu
<BR>
hustle them to behave a little nicer maybe?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One might argue that if one runs a multinational organisation dedicated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to looking after the sick and dying, one ought to be spending a _little_
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of that money on medical care. And there's a certain contradiction between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that vow of obedience, chastity and poverty and a quarter of a billion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bucks ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Was that in cash or in the value of all the property on which her
<BR>
hospices were standing? Was there an endowment that was paying the real
<BR>
expenses of the order? Just because you take a vow of poverty doesn't
<BR>
mean you don't get paid anything. All preists and nuns receive meager
<BR>
stipends, as well as room and board. They typically also get their
<BR>
college educations paid for by the church (and only some major in
<BR>
theology).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll need to go digging to come up with the exposes I read, and I'd need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do a bit more digging to verify them, but the picture I have of Teresa
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Calcutta is of a scheming bitch whose life-goal was not merely to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get herself beatified, but to found a holy order that would keep her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; name alive for a thousand years.
</EM><BR>
<P>You can find plenty of such exposes, if that is the predetermined
<BR>
picture you wish to illustrate. There are literally thousands of
<BR>
catholic hating protestants and atheists, who are willing to say just
<BR>
about anything to prove their point, though I'd say the protestants
<BR>
might be worse. Try looking up websites affiliated with Bob Jones
<BR>
University if you are looking for real dirt.
