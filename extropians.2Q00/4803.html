<EM>&gt; &gt;When I discuss transhumanism in Swedish, I tend to use the word
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;utveckling&quot; (literally translated it becomes &quot;out-unfolding&quot;), which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;has the meaning of development, evolution, progress, growth,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;generation etc. (you can see that Swedish lacks the synonyms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;English :-). The nice thing is that it conjures up an image of not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;linear progression, but rather something unfolding and developing into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;many directions at once.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anders: If you check earlier versions of the Principles, you'll see that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead of Perpetual Progress I used to have &quot;Boundless Expansion&quot;. A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; number of people didn't like that, thinking that it gaving the impression
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we wanted to &quot;pave over the universe&quot;. &quot;Expansion&quot; or &quot;unfolding&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (thought the latter I don't like as much) *does* more clearly convey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multiple paths, or diverse *ways* of making progress. But then how to avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;paving over&quot; (and perhaps imperialist) connotations of &quot;expansion&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>How about 'Infinite Hyper-Diversity'?
<BR>
<P>However, Robert Bradbury's ideas of dismantling solar systems is probably the
<BR>
epitome of 'paving over the universe', but this is  IMHO more a failing in the
<BR>
perceptions of others, because there is still the popular connotation that
<BR>
Expansion = Progress = Development = Sprawl = 'Los Angelization' = Paving Over
<BR>
the Universe = Very Bad Thing.
<BR>
<P>While I like many of Robert's ideas on this score, I think that choosing what
<BR>
can be perceived as a Vogon-type attitude toward other worlds doesn't properly
<BR>
communicate our true objectives. People are still stuck in ecological mindsets,
<BR>
so I think that promoting the ideas of making the universe into our gardens and
<BR>
parks is more positive and reflects our aspirations better. Damien's vision of
<BR>
this in _The White Abacus_ is very much what I see as the sort of future many of
<BR>
us want.
