<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the argument for antitrust legislation, and I absolutely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; agree with you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; antitrust legislation merely changes the market to one where it evolves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to satisfy those willing and able to bribe the government into breaking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; up their competitors. In an anarchy, everyone will be armed, so nobody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has a monopoly on force, and nobody can force others to their bidding.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think that's correct.  In anarchy anyone who can exert force to gain will,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; barring pacificists and particularly, sincerely moral people.  It's called survival
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the fittest.
</EM><BR>
<P>And survival of the fittest has shown that 'live and let live' is a far more
<BR>
profitable survival tactic than agression and force. It is why the states with
<BR>
the least government and the least regard for government have the most polite,
<BR>
well mannered, considerate, and good neighborly populations, while those with
<BR>
greater levels of government are rife with crime, rudeness, callousness, and
<BR>
disregard for others. Your claim does not hold to reality.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The government gets about a third of the GDP in tax income, they take a cut every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time you buy groceries or live on your own land, they take a cut when you are born,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drive, and die, they take a cut when you wed or split.  The (U.S.) government spends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about 25% or more of its income on guns and other military spending, when we are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at war, except for the government on its own people.  The U.S. government imprisons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than 2 million U.S. citizens for various founded and unfounded reasons, paid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for by the ones not literally shackled.  I'm sure anyone can provide examples of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government waste.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The government needs correction like a choke-chain on a dog or some excisement,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because parts are ferally malignant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Overtaxation, overimprisonment, unequal treatment under law, and institutionalized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infringements of rights are examples of bad government.
</EM><BR>
<P>here you counter your earlier argument. Government creates an uneven playing
<BR>
field in the exercise of force. It maintains its own greater force, it disarms
<BR>
downtrodden minorities and the lower classes who live in cities, and it protects
<BR>
the predatory behaviors of mercantilists so long as the mercantilists pay the
<BR>
proper amount of baksheesh to the politicians that control things.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are good things about good government. Most roads and public thoroughfares are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well kept.
</EM><BR>
<P>Roads, thoroughfairs, and other channels of commerce can easily be maintained by
<BR>
private organizations like block associations, insurance companies, merchants
<BR>
guilds, etc.
