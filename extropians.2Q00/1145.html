<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Gina Miller&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:nanogirl@halcyon.com?Subject=Re:%20Death%20Penalty%20(was%20Re:%20Didn't%20need%20no%20welfare%20state)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000419003756.21378.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">nanogirl@halcyon.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have a feeling that one day in the future, we will consider capitol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;punishment just as barbaric as foreign countries see us now, (Europe seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to look down on our electric chair) or as we now view the guillotine. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;acknowledge that I have extreme viewpoints towards hypocritical punishment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Here's our government &quot;we do not allow killing, it is wrong, so we will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you&quot;. To me, (and I know not a lot will agree, here's where I throw in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disclaimer: people can use physical punishment towards their own children,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that's their family, their business, and their choice, although I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chose not to&quot;) it is just as ironic as if I had a child (say Timmy), that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was hitting the neighbor kid , 'little Cindy' from down the street, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;said &quot;Timmy it's wrong to hit other's&quot; and proceeded to hit him 'as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;punishment'. I know that not everyone will agree with this, but I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exact punishments, tend to escalate the action. If we kill murder's, does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this prevent any further murders?
</EM><BR>
<P>Although I tend toward the &quot;bleeding heart&quot; end of the spectrum, I look at 
<BR>
capital punishment as a cost vs. benefit analysis.  You got a human scum 
<BR>
(say, Charlie Manson) who has amply demonstrated that he will never be good 
<BR>
for anything except warming a prison cell.  Do we keep him alive for no good 
<BR>
reason until he wastes away, at a cost of umpteen thousand dollars per year, 
<BR>
or do we put him and us out of our mutual misery by killing and cremating 
<BR>
him at a cost of a few thousand and be done with it?  The answer to me seems 
<BR>
obvious.
