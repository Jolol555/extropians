No argument that communism is not bunk. Its attractions were the ideals of 
<BR>
equality, but that merely translated to peasant dictatorships based on 
<BR>
adherence to local, cultural, love-affairs with tyranny like the Soviet and 
<BR>
East Asian Communist Societies. Communism seems to produce Auto-Genocides as 
<BR>
in the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, North Korea. 
<BR>
<P>National Socialism produces Xeno-Genocide; the subjugation or elimination of 
<BR>
proscribed peoples. Note: you 4-1 ration is skewed, I believe, because Nazism 
<BR>
lasted only 13 years and Soviet Socialism was murdered people 'en masse' 
<BR>
since 1917. The Great Leap Forward caused about 28 millions deaths in China 
<BR>
between 1958-1963, alone.  Its still in business, the business of brutal 
<BR>
repressions and a lust to dominate. Some scholars now see the Communist party 
<BR>
running China as not the Middle Kingdom, but acting as a Bismarkian Germay 
<BR>
did, circa 1866 onward.

<P>&lt;&lt; Karl Marx claimed that communism was a scientific theory. As such, it must
<BR>
&nbsp;be testable, right? If communism in practice during the 20th century is
<BR>
&nbsp;considered as a series of experiments with known results and consequences,
<BR>
&nbsp;it has been a catastrophic failure. It has not delivered the propserity,
<BR>
&nbsp;freedom or transformation of man that it predicted. Therefore,
<BR>
&nbsp;scientifically, Marxism is bunk.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Before looking at its direct results, let's consider the side effects of
<BR>
&nbsp;implementing communism. According to the French ex-communist scholars who
<BR>
&nbsp;compiled &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; communist governments for political
<BR>
&nbsp;reasons have killed approximately 100 million civilians (i.e.,
<BR>
&nbsp;non-combatants in any war or revolutionary conflict). For comparison, please
<BR>
&nbsp;note that this is 4 times the number of civilians killed by the Nazis. More
<BR>
&nbsp;difficult to quantify are the lives ruined and human potential wasted by
<BR>
&nbsp;communist governments. However, based on anecdotal reports of those who have
<BR>
&nbsp;lived under communist governments, it would be fair to state that writers,
<BR>
&nbsp;artists, philosophers, and would-be entrepreneurs were not given the chance
<BR>
&nbsp;to succeed on their own terms. Their less-than-maximum contributions to
<BR>
&nbsp;their respective societies cannot easily be tabulated, but surely represent
<BR>
&nbsp;a tremendous loss to those societies and to the human race as a whole.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;On the positive side, many scientists and engineers did have the opportunity
<BR>
&nbsp;to work up to their potential with some exceptions, including Darwinian
<BR>
&nbsp;biologists who had been suppressed in the Soviet Union during the reign of
<BR>
&nbsp;Lysenkoism (an offshoot of Lamarkism), and engineers who would have
<BR>
&nbsp;preferred to work on non-military projects but who had been assigned to
<BR>
&nbsp;military work without their consent.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;In terms of the material abundance, there is plenty of proof that communism
<BR>
&nbsp;fails to deliver. The joke in the old Soviet Union was that if communism
<BR>
&nbsp;came to the Sahara Desert there would be a shortage of sand. Recall that
<BR>
&nbsp;Russian coalmine workers went on strike during the final year of the USSR's
<BR>
&nbsp;existence. What was there non-negotiable demand? Soap!  If you've ever seen
<BR>
&nbsp;the blacked faces and hands of men emerging from a coalmine, you know that
<BR>
&nbsp;soap is nearly as important to them as food. If communism promises to give
<BR>
&nbsp;to all according to their needs, how can it deny soap to coalminers?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Then there is the whole matter of quality. Communism is the reign of
<BR>
&nbsp;quantity over quality. Factories were required to produce assigned
<BR>
&nbsp;quantities of good, even though the quality of those goods was so low that
<BR>
&nbsp;no one with any other options would buy them. Thus we have the situation of
<BR>
&nbsp;the post-Soviet 1990s when Russian goods (still being made by workers and
<BR>
&nbsp;managers trained under communism) cannot compete on world markets. In fact,
<BR>
&nbsp;the situation is even worse than that. Their manufactured goods are so bad
<BR>
&nbsp;that the world market has priced them below the market value of their raw
<BR>
&nbsp;material inputs. Can you imagine that? The legacy of communist economics is
<BR>
&nbsp;an industrial system that *REMOVES* value from raw materials!
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;But let's give credit to communism where it is due: Under communism, few
<BR>
&nbsp;people starved unless the government wanted them to. Stalin starved farmers
<BR>
&nbsp;in the Ukraine during the 1930s by confiscating their crops. Mao did the
<BR>
&nbsp;same with his cockamamie schemes of the 1950s and 1960s. But for most
<BR>
&nbsp;citizens, there was bread or rice, and a few other vegetables with some
<BR>
&nbsp;occasional meat. And that's pretty much all there was for the next 50 or 60
<BR>
&nbsp;years. So for anyone whose greatest dream is to have a subsistence diet
<BR>
&nbsp;while foregoing freedom of speech, association, religion and economic
<BR>
&nbsp;opportunity, communism offers just the morsels they crave.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Given the manifest failures of communism, we must ask why Marxism is still
<BR>
&nbsp;taken seriously by anyone. Certainly there are enough Marxist professors at
<BR>
&nbsp;American universities to make this question pertinent. I believe the answer
<BR>
&nbsp;is memetic: Marxism is a potent meme-complex that fits neatly into the mind
<BR>
&nbsp;space that would otherwise be occupied by other grand meme-complexes such as
<BR>
&nbsp;Catholicism or Transhumanism. Assuming that to be the case, we clearly need
<BR>
&nbsp;to redouble our efforts to introduce Extropian memes to those susceptible
<BR>
&nbsp;young undergraduate minds that otherwise could be swayed by the poisonous
<BR>
&nbsp;dreams of Marx.
