</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lets look at the number of cameras in a total ubiquitous open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; surveillance system:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Range of average camera(at useful resolution): 50 m radius
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Field of view: 90 degrees
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Area under surveillance by 1 camera: ~7500 square meters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Area of dry surface of Earth: 148,300,000 square kilometers or,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 14,830,000,000,000,000 square meters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Number of cameras necessary to cover every square meter of the dry
</EM><BR>
land
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the planet:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 20,000,000,000,000, or 20 trillion cameras,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But the vast majority of those cameras would be pointing at a place
</EM><BR>
where
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there aren't any humans, vehicles or robots and so would be worthless. A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fairly universal surveillance system (obviously I agree no system will
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; perfect) could get by with a tiny fraction of that number of cameras,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; particularly if the cameras are mobile.  As for cost, already today you
</EM><BR>
can
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; get an (admittedly rubbish quality) web-cam for less than £50, and at
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; price it wouldn't be exhorbitantly expensive to have every room in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; house under surveillance. (You may be relieved to hear that I don't have
</EM><BR>
any
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; plans to start webcasting Meonthetoilet.com any time soon :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good to hear. However, the fact that a camera isn't pointing at anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't mean it won't be on the network, and won't be getting data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; downloaded from it by automated filter/analysis systems, and won't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taking up bandwidth.
</EM><BR>
<P>My point was that the majority of your hypothesised 20 trillion cameras
<BR>
would be unnecessary (and therefore wouldn't exist).  There would be little
<BR>
point in putting a camera in the middle of an uninhabited forest (unless you
<BR>
want to check if a falling tree makes a noise when there's no one around to
<BR>
hear it). Also, even very crude filtering technology (cameras don't record
<BR>
unless the image changes, let's say) could drastically reduce the need for
<BR>
bandwidth and memory.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Moreover, a current day web-cam is of pathetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quality as an instrument of surveillance.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed, but significantly better cameras do exist and I don't think it would
<BR>
be very controversial to claim that their cost is likely to plummet. Also,
<BR>
note that even a cheap and nasty, present day web-cam would still be of some
<BR>
use for surveillance. (It might not be able to ID someone by their
<BR>
fingerprints from across the room but it would be able to detect the
<BR>
presence of an intruder). See also Eugene's comments wrt gait analysis etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Additionally you brought up a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; factor that would INCREASE the number of cameras on the network:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enclosed areas. For example, my apartment is less than 100 square
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meters, yet I would need 5 cameras to cover it all on the interior, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there would be many billions of areas of suboptimal coverage where you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would need overlap. My original calculation was that  there was optimal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; area coverage and camera utilization.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even with a great deal of redundancy, there is no way you would need to have
<BR>
20 trillion cameras to keep track of 6 billion people (or perhaps ten
<BR>
billion in the near-ish future).  Particularly if some of the cameras are
<BR>
mobile.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If that level of surveillance is possible today, I don't think it's a
</EM><BR>
huge
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stretch to postulate a future system which could cover not just your
</EM><BR>
house,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but also shops, businesses, public areas etc and at significantly higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; quality than the best available  today. Sure, if you decide to go hiking
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the middle of nowhere there won't be any cameras, apart from those you
</EM><BR>
bring
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with you (or ones which follow you if we soup up the tech a bit).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, this system would be totally dedicated toward security, nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else. Most people wouldn't care to spend more than 1-5% of their annual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; income on personal security.
</EM><BR>
<P>But by the time you add up spending on defense, the police &amp; insurance you
<BR>
already spend significantly more than 5% of your income on security - plus
<BR>
there's the cost of maintaining all those guns. :)  Surely in a future which
<BR>
contains considerably nastier threats than today you'd be prepared to spend
<BR>
even more.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You are talking about a system that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost several times the entire GDP of the planet to build and maintain on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an annual basis. Cameras wear out, cameras get destroyed by weather, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by people who don't want to be seen.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope, I'm talking about a system which a fairly well-off individual could
<BR>
implement a primitive personal version of TODAY.  If I so desired, I could
<BR>
have every room in my house (and it's exterior) covered by web-cams. I could
<BR>
also strap a series of small video cameras and microphones about my person,
<BR>
all of which could upload in real time everything they record to multiple
<BR>
remote servers.  Meanwhile speech-to-text software could be transcribing
<BR>
every word I say (or at least most of them) and those of people near to me
<BR>
or on my property. Likewise voice analysis software could match the voices
<BR>
to existing profiles to get their names or flag a voice it hadn't heard
<BR>
before. Even some kind of basic threat detection system is fairly easy to
<BR>
do - My house might send me a message as I approach that one of the external
<BR>
cameras has &quot;spotted&quot; someone hiding behind my dustbin, perhaps waiting to
<BR>
attack me.  I bring up the image being recorded by that camera on my palm
<BR>
top (with mobile data link), confirm that the lurker looks suspicious and
<BR>
alert the police.
<BR>
<P>Note that whilst all the above might severely eat into my beer money, it's
<BR>
all possible with technology available now.  And this technology is going to
<BR>
get (much) cheaper and (much) more powerful.

<P>If I'm particularly paranoid about the prospect of being poisoned I could

avoid food which has been prepared in a non-monitored area.  However, I

would think that any reputable restaurant might have such monitoring to

trigger

would
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; presume that the act of disabling a camera in a public place (or on

someone
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; else's property) would itself be a crime and footage just prior to the

zap
<BR>

on

<EM>&gt; &gt; the scene).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Also, if the technology was good enough to have a personal mobile camera

<EM>&gt; &gt; covering everyone then anyone who disabled their own camera (prior to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; crime) would be inviting suspicion and might automatically be tracked by

<EM>&gt; &gt; other cameras as they pass. Yeah, we're talking a lot of computing power

<BR>
<EM>&gt; THis is the worst weasley argument to make. The paradox of this argument
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) your perceptions of crime and our trust in humanity today are based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upon the lowest common denominator
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; b) the lowest common denominator is a low paid, low intellect, low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; educated lowlife.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ignoring victimless crime, the majority of criminals do fit this
<BR>
description - for every 1 Professor Moriarty, there are 500 thugs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; c) at the same time, you claim to hold the transhumanist ethic that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology will lift up and improve the lives of all people, increasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their intelligence and capacity to learn, and access to knowledge and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; d) that your perceptions of crime are based on the lowest quartile of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the population, while your expectations of the future population reflect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the highest quartile.
</EM><BR>
<P>If most victimless crime now is committed by the lowest quartile (conjures
<BR>
up images of Snow White and the seven deadly dwarves) then
<BR>
this seems reasonable.  I don't see any paradox in my expectation that
<BR>
future technology will enable these people to exceed the capability of the
<BR>
&quot;highest quartile&quot; today.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; e) you are assuming that the transhumanist trends will make human beings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better people, but when it comes to crime you assume that they will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become the worst possible human beings.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would like to think that transhumanist trends will make human beings
<BR>
better people, but what if they only make them more capable people? (I can't
<BR>
see you, or myself for that matter, supporting government controlled brain
<BR>
editing, surgically enforcing some norm of niceness). Given that, some
<BR>
people are still likely to turn to crime (if they can get away wiith it) and
<BR>
as technology improves, the possibility that an individual could take out a
<BR>
significant proportion of humanity will also rise. Not a cheering prospect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is the perceptual dissonance in the arguments for total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance that makes it not only distasteful for me, but IMHO exposes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hypocrisy of the people who beleive in it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Given that surveillance tech is already powerful and will become vastly more
<BR>
so, I see only two future possibilities:
<BR>
<P>1) Highly intrusive surveillance is developed but made illegal for everyone
<BR>
but governments (which use it to spy on their powerless citizens).
<BR>
<P>2) Highly intrusive surveillance is developed but the citizens have access
<BR>
to it themselves and can use it to monitor governments (and each other).
<BR>
<P>You may not like either option, but given a choice between the two, I'd
<BR>
rather have the second.

prepared to go to great lengths to maintain it.
