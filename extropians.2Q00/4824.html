<EM>&gt; &gt; I agree.  While we may all be able to agree on the meaning of the terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;entropy&quot; and its opposite, &quot;extropy&quot;, I think the term &quot;extropian&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; subject to more debate.  One person might (reasonably) claim that you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not extropian unless you live by the stated principles of ExI.  Another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; person might (just as reasonably) claim that you are extropian if you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; merely opposed to the increase of entropy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Surely the key question is whether ExI has exclusive use of the term?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, if you mean do they have the exclusive right to say the word, I think 
<BR>
the answer to that is pretty obvious.  However, if (as I suspect) what you 
<BR>
are asking is whether ExI members are the only ones who can properly call 
<BR>
themselves Extropians, that's a little harder to answer.  I suppose you 
<BR>
can't stop even the most Luddite of persons from calling themselves 
<BR>
Extropian, just like, as an atheistic-leaning agnostic, I could call myself 
<BR>
a &quot;Catholic&quot; if I wanted to.  Does that mean I'm really a Catholic?  Hardly.
<BR>
<P>So for those who, for whatever reason, feel the need to label themselves, I 
<BR>
suppose they can put whatever words they want on those labels.  But the 
<BR>
labels would be pretty meaningless unless there was at least *some* 
<BR>
consensus on the definitions of the words on those labels.  To that extent 
<BR>
if the members of ExI want to claim exclusive right to use the &quot;Extropian&quot; 
<BR>
label, I have no problem with that.  But that doesn't mean there isn't room 
<BR>
for others who could use similar or related labels (i.e. social-Extropian, 
<BR>
philosophical-Extropian, neo-Extropian, classic-Extropian, reform-Extropian, 
<BR>
liberal-, conservative-, etc., etc.).
<BR>
<P>My feeling, FWIW, is that the label --whatever it is-- is superfluous.  I 
<BR>
live my life.  I love when I am influenced by the reason or beauty of 
<BR>
others' ideas.  That's why I participate on this list.  My outlook and 
<BR>
opinions ebb and flow with the more ideas I am exposed to.  Am I an 
<BR>
Extropian?  I don't know, perhaps not.  Even if I was, I don't think I would 
<BR>
label myself with the term.  I don't see the point.
