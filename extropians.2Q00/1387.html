Art Bell???? What is it about Art Bell thats so interesting? I've never 
<BR>
heard so many zoned out loonies as I have when listening to that show, and 
<BR>
they take themselves so seriously. At least Stern is entertaining..
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Mike, it really depends on the guest and the subject!  I loved the Art Bell 
<BR>
show interview with Brian Shock of Alcor.  He has also had some excellent 
<BR>
shows with a nanotech expert and also several other good programs with 
<BR>
scientists (Kikuchi among them) and science fiction writers(such as Greg 
<BR>
Bear).
<BR>
<P>I recommend you go to Art's excellent website and look into his program and 
<BR>
guest archive.  You can listen to any show he has had without any charge AND 
<BR>
skip over the damn commercials!
<BR>
<P>I have grown to appreciate Art's personality and life experience.  Regarding 
<BR>
Stern, I saw his movie and have seen some of his shows on cable.  I like how 
<BR>
his self-depracating sense of humor.  Stern is very observant about life, 
<BR>
people and the human condition in his own raunchy way but goes way over the 
<BR>
top at times.
<BR>
<P>I happen to be fascinated by NDE and haunting accounts as well as UFO 
<BR>
sightings, and so I enjoy the show for that also.  Even as a believer in NDE 
<BR>
and UFO's, I find some of the proponents for it credible and others not so.  
<BR>
Am I 100% sure these phoenomena are for real?  No, I am not, but I do see it 
<BR>
as a real possibility.
<BR>
<P>Often, I find myself very irritated by the guests due to their 'new age' 
<BR>
beliefs that are way too 'out there' even for me.  Then I simply turn off 
<BR>
the radio and go to sleep.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John
