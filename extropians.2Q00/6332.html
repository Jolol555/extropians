I think whatever influence Foresight had developed is rapidly fading. They
<BR>
helped bring things this far, but are going to be pushed out of the way
<BR>
and kept on the fringe. Reminds me of how Jodie Foster's character got
<BR>
treated in the movie Contact when her boss took all the credit for her work.

<EM>&gt; Wired news reports this morning about a conference at NIH on &quot;Nanoscience
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and Nanotechnology: Shaping Biomedical Research&quot;.  The first substantive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talk, &quot;What is Nanotechnology?&quot;, was by Steven Block, who wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Against the backdrop of much exciting technical and scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; development, there are legitimate expectations for breakthroughs in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; areas such as computing/electronics, biotechnology, materials, and so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on. In many cases, these expectations seem realistic and appropriate,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and therefore merit the attention and support of government agencies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; academia, and the private sector.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In others cases, the expectations seem naïve and unrealistic: these are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; primarily being advanced by a vocal cult of futurists whose enthusiasm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is beyond question, but whose agenda is not. I will argue that for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; real science to proceed, nanotechnologists ought to distance themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from the giggle factor and position themselves for the serious work of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the 21st century.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Wired article makes it clear that it is Drexler and his associates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whom Block is criticizing here.  As nanotech goes mainstream I suspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we will see more of this kind of distancing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another point made by Block, echoed in the title of the conference,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that there is real science still to be done at the nanoscale.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This contradicts the often-heard claim of nanotech advocates that all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basic science has been done, and all that is needed is straightforward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering work to put the pieces together.
