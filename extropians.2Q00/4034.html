<P><EM>&gt;  But I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  think one must do to judge, else only those who have killed would be able 
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  sentence a murderer.  Only those who cooked would be able to judge a meal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  And we'd all have to shut up here about &quot;The Matrix,&quot; since, as far as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  know, there are no film directors among us.  (Am I wrong?  If so, please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  speak.  I've lots of questions about film.:)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Daniel, you are wrong, if you think that we can speak AUTHORATIVELy on film.
<BR>
To speak about them, sure... but unless we are familiar with the making of 
<BR>
films, we won't sound very good to those who know.
<BR>
<P>No one here is saying one must be a visual artist to know about art. The four 
<BR>
VAPA standards I set out for you are general education ones. Creative 
<BR>
Expression is ONE of  some very basic most simple fundamentals that one can 
<BR>
learn about. They are not up for debate. They exist outside of your sphere of 
<BR>
control. Debating them is pointless.
<BR>
<P>I hated that stupid thing about a chef  cooking plaster thing you said to 
<BR>
Natasha, it's a dumb argument, drop it. Are you nuts? I hope she ignores it.
<BR>
<P>Likewise we don't need to be film makers to discuss The Matrix. I disliked 
<BR>
that film,  so I am not discussing it, since I am not knowledgeable enough 
<BR>
about films to defend my position. I keep my mouth shut, like Ayn rand should 
<BR>
have done, since it is out of my area of expertise to provide a true valid 
<BR>
critique. I can only say it bored me.
<BR>
<P>But for you to insist that an educated person will bow to the knowledge of an 
<BR>
uneducated one and discuss the virtues of that person's ideas when I see 
<BR>
none, is a waste of (your and my)  time.
<BR>
<P>Re: film: I would listen to my dearest friend, who has worked in films before 
<BR>
I would listen to my mom who has not.
