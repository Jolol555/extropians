<EM>&gt; &gt;I have an idea of my own; those who wish to buy guns who prove themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too dense to lock them up when kids are in the house forfeit their right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep and bear.  We are losing twelve kids a day...That's waaay too many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (4380 per year) when simple precautions by responsible adults (including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the denial of gun possession to the irresponsible adults) could drastically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reduce this number.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But punishing such irresponsibles (including taking away their guns) before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fact, is clearly impossible without some kind of universal licensing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and/or registration of weapons, plus a significant branch of law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcement devoted to finding violators.  And, according to many opponents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of gun-control, such as L. Neil Smith, this makes it much easier for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government to disarm its citizens, and a disarmed citizenry is an important
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (if not *the* most important) factor in the rise of totalitarianism.  Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; totalitarian regimes have and do cause many more deaths than 4380 per year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (especially if you include the casualties of war, poverty, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technological stagnation), and since the freest countries have periods of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; near-totalitarian behavior (Vietnam draft, War on Drugs), these are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; questions you should answer:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) What better counterthreat do we have against Bill Clinton, Janet Reno,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Barry McCaffrey, et al., than our own lethal force, our own privacy, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that of those around us?  What better way to decrease the chance of Hitler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happening here?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) Since we claim to have a very long-term perspective, what relative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weights should we assign to a)some thousands of deaths projected for next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; year, most of which occur in specific settings easily avoidable by you and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me, and b)some millions of deaths projected 10 or 30 years in the future,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and much less avoidable by you and me?
