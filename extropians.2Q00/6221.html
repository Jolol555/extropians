<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  Do you think directing some of your charity dollars to it vs. perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  something more direct like an organization working to accelerate the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  singularity would be a good choice?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I honestly (and pretty strongly) think that things like this DO accelerate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the arrival of a significantly better future for me, whether that's a true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;singularity&quot; or not.  The safer, more prosperous and wiser the whole world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is, the more resources societies like our can devote to developing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; technologies we need to advance the transhumanist agenda.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Doesn't answer the quantitative question; e.g. how much good is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accomplished by sending one dollar to a transhumanist organization vs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one dollar to Greenstar?  Greenstar will get loads of cash dumped on it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by every private foundation on the planet.  The transhumanist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;organizations need *us* as their support base.
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite right; transhumanist organizations can further our interests (like 
<BR>
cryonics, mind uploading, neurohacking and other stuff that's badly 
<BR>
underfunded &amp; generally neglected by the mainstream) in a much more 
<BR>
efficient and direct fashion than a &quot;general-purpose&quot; charity organization 
<BR>
like Greenstar could ever do. We must take care of our own, for if we don't 
<BR>
do it, no-one will. Well, not anytime soon anyway, and we may not have that 
<BR>
much time left (both as individuals and as a species).
<BR>
<P>So, let's encourage donations to the really good cause. Of course, the 
<BR>
easier you make it to donate money, the more you will get. That's why I'm 
<BR>
somewhat surprised that ExI, Alcor, the WTA, Foresight, the Singularity 
<BR>
Institute (is it official now?) etc. aren't using e-gold yet; it's fast, 
<BR>
easy, and could create additional income streams for the above mentioned 
<BR>
orgs thanks to its (equally user-friendly) referral program.
<BR>
<P>Below a short description of the e-gold system, but much more detailed info 
<BR>
can be found at the e-gold website
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.e-gold.com/e-gold.asp?cid=131563">http://www.e-gold.com/e-gold.asp?cid=131563</A> 
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.e-gold.com/e-gold.asp?cid=131563">http://www.e-gold.com/e-gold.asp?cid=131563</A>&gt; Yeah, that's my personal 
<BR>
referral link; if you choose to set up an account you can think of it as a 
<BR>
way of saying &quot;thank you&quot; for pointing out an interesting concept ;) ExI 
<BR>
ect. could have a link like this on their website. 
<BR>
Extropians/Transhumanists/Cryonicists who would sign up for an account via 
<BR>
that link could support their favorite organization simply by using their 
<BR>
e-gold account for other transactions.
<BR>
<P>------
<BR>
E-Gold is a universal payment system which is 100% backed by gold. If so 
<BR>
desired, you can fund your E-Gold account immediately via Western Union, 
<BR>
Check, Money Order or Bank Transfer. Setting up an account is free and a 
<BR>
matter of minutes. E-Gold transactions are immediate. You can use e-gold to 
<BR>
pay others with e-gold accounts (and if they don't have one yet, they can 
<BR>
use your referral link to go to the e-gold website and create one within 
<BR>
minutes), but you can also exchange your e-gold for any of the following 
<BR>
currencies: USD, CAD, AUD, GBP, DEM, JPY, CHF, FFR. You can also exchange 
<BR>
one kind of e-metal for another if so desired (you can choose form gold, 
<BR>
silver, platinum and palladium).
<BR>
<P>The referral system works as follows: all e-gold account holders are 
<BR>
&quot;Originators&quot;. When you direct a new user to the e-gold system using your 
<BR>
personal referral link(s)  they become your &quot;Progeny&quot;. You will be the 
<BR>
beneficiary of incentive payments generated by the Progeny account. You 
<BR>
will receive an email notifying you as each of your Progeny are &quot;born&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Every time anyone clicks an e-metal payment, the payment processing fee is 
<BR>
automatically split three ways:
<BR>
-- 25% of the fee (up to 12.5 cents (US$-equivalent) worth of e-metal) will be
<BR>
credited to the account of the person or company who originally referred the
<BR>
payer to e-gold,
<BR>
-- 25% of the fee (up to 12.5 cents worth) will go to whoever originally 
<BR>
referred
<BR>
the payee to e-gold,
<BR>
--50% of the fee (up to 25 cents worth ) will go to the Reserve Institution 
<BR>
of the payee.
<BR>
The e-metal payment processing fee is not being increased. It is being 
<BR>
divided up. It remains 1%, in metal, deducted from payee, subject to a 
<BR>
maximum of 50 cents (US$-equivalent) worth of e-metal, a fraction of what 
<BR>
credit card companies charge.
<BR>
