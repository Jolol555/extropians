OK.  I'm sure willing not to use the word capitalism to describe the Mexican
<BR>
economy.  But I don't think it's exactly feudal mercantilism either, at
<BR>
least not like what existed in Europe in 1600.  You could say it's a mixture
<BR>
of feudal mercantilism and capitalism, as the U.S. economy is a mixture of
<BR>
capitalism and socialism and fascism. None of these terms seems to have a
<BR>
very precise meaning.  In both of these countries there's an active
<BR>
&quot;underground&quot; economy.
<BR>
<P>So here's a question that occurred to me and led me to use a different
<BR>
subject heading for this message.  In which country can there exist a
<BR>
healthier underground economy--Mexico or the U.S.?  Will the partial
<BR>
dissolution of borders change this? As far as I can tell, there seem to be
<BR>
at least 2 underground economies in both the U.S. and Mexico.  One kind is
<BR>
controlled by organizations similar to governments where a small elite group
<BR>
controls the rest of the parties involved in the economy (&quot;organized
<BR>
crime&quot;)and, I suspect, though I don't have first hand knowledge, that these
<BR>
underground economies have close ties to the governments alongside of which
<BR>
they operate. The other kind is a true free-market economy. I'm asking the
<BR>
question about both kinds, but in particular the latter, the free market
<BR>
underground economy.

<EM>&gt; -----altamira is alleged to have uttered the following;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;quote&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can't claim to have visited many 3rd world countries, but I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spent some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time in Mexico. I've noticed 2 major causes of poverty there.  One is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Catholic church which discourages the use of contraceptives and abortion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The second is the behavior of people who hold positions of power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governmental and corporate entities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When you buy bananas at the grocery store, odds are they came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from land that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was once occupied by people who grew enough food, fiber, and fuel crops on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the land to take care of themselves.  Business corporations, acting in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conjunction with the Mexican (and sometimes the U.S.) government,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; took over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the land and gave the people who'd been using it the option of leaving or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; staying there and working for the corporation at very low wages,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would use to buy exorbitantly priced food at the grocery store
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (likely also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; owned by the corporation). The more self-respecting of the dispossessed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; peasants go to seek their fortunes in the city.  The lucky ones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have friends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the U.S. who can help them find work (if they can make it safely across
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the border and get past the check points). Others live on the outskirts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cities such as Mexico D.F.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the ugly side of capitalism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;end quote&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I take exception to the last sentence.  I don't call a &quot;protection racket&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capitalism.  What is the deference between the above scenario (where a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporation engages in acts of extortion with government backing) and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a local thug extortion shopkeepers with union boss/policitcal machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boss approval?  The only difference I see is scale.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree and accept what you said...but don't call it capitalism.
