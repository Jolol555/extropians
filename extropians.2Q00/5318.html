<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Governments do determine the economic system. Are you really trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to say governments don't make decisions and act on them?
</EM><BR>
<P>Brian, there are 3 reasons I stressed the fact that it's individual people
<BR>
who make decisions.  The first is that people tend too much to lose
<BR>
themselves in the collective.  They can then rationalize all sorts of
<BR>
actions which they would have considered immoral if they'd done them
<BR>
individually.  Take, for example, stealing from wage earners via the income
<BR>
tax in order to pay to have a federal office building designed and
<BR>
constructed.  Most legislators who vote in favor of a bill authorizing such
<BR>
stealing would consider it immoral to go from door to door with a gun,
<BR>
demanding that each family turn over a certain amount of money or suffer
<BR>
severe consequences.  And yet, within the safety of the collective, their
<BR>
consciences bother them not at all.  In fact, they're able to convince
<BR>
themselves that they're doing something noble and good.  I don't like to let
<BR>
people get away with this kind of thinking.  When a legislator votes &quot;yes&quot;
<BR>
to send various employees out to steal from people, it's still as immoral as
<BR>
though she'd stolen the money herself.
<BR>
<P>The second reason I stressed the incapacity of governments to believe,
<BR>
decide, and act is that people have a tendency to build such collectives up
<BR>
into omnipotent godlike entities rather than seeing them as associations of
<BR>
indicidual twits. Taking this view of Government as God caused people to
<BR>
feel cowed and helpless, so they tend to just ride the current and look the
<BR>
other way when they see government employees doing bad things.
<BR>
<P>The third reason is that people who would prefer to act as autonomous
<BR>
individuals tend to see themselves as an insinificant compared to the whole
<BR>
mass of humanity and to think that any action they take to change things
<BR>
will be insignificant and doomed to failure. Most people don't even realize
<BR>
they're doing this until they stop and think hard about it, and so they
<BR>
never experiment to see how much room there is to maneuver while still
<BR>
keeping a low profile. A person can revolutionize his own life by shifting
<BR>
the way he sees his position relative to the whole.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fascism: a system of government characterized by dictatorship,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; belligerent nationalism, and racism, militarism, etc: first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instituted in Italy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Don't see a fit.
</EM><BR>
<P>Individuals still owned businesses, homes, and so forth under this system.
<BR>
The state didn't take title to everything as it does under communism, which,
<BR>
in practice, is also characterized by the things you listed above.  I have a
<BR>
similar definition of fascism in my dictionary, but I think one of the
<BR>
characteristics which distinguish it from other dictatorships, such as
<BR>
communist dictatorships, is that title to at least some productive assets
<BR>
remains in private hands.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;But I don't want to let definitions get in the way of the point I was
<BR>
trying to make, which is that while title in the U.S. remains in private
<BR>
hands, ownership means far less now than it did 100 years ago.  Here's an
<BR>
example:  if you happen to own land that has a swamp on it you're not
<BR>
allowed to drain the swamp and use the land.  It has to remain a swamp.
<BR>
Here's another example: you hire a dozer to dig a pond (after doing the
<BR>
federally required environmental impact study, which raises the cost of your
<BR>
pond considerably), and when the pond fills up you stock it with catfish
<BR>
which you plan to eat.  A flock of cattle egrets moves into the trees around
<BR>
the pond, and their copious droppings are causing your fish to die.  You're
<BR>
not allowed to shoot or in any other way interfere with the egrets.  Here's
<BR>
another example: You own a business which manufactures fasteners used in
<BR>
constructing nuclear power plants. You wish to set up your building and
<BR>
machinery a certain way, but instead you must follow federal guidelines.
<BR>
I'm sure there's no need to go on, although I could go on for pages and
<BR>
pages listing all the ways in which private ownership has deteriorated.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The opposite of Communism is not Democracy as I often hear on T.V,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the opposite of Communism is Capitalism. The opposite of Democracy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is Totalitarianism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, democracy is quite a dangerous system if you happen not to always
<BR>
agree with the majority. I'm not sure it's helpful to speak in terms of
<BR>
opposites when you're talking about something as complex as economic and
<BR>
political systems, but if I were to choose an opposite for totalitarianism,
<BR>
I'd say anarchy.
