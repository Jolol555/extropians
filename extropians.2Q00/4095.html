<EM>&gt; &gt; I suppose I can see how her ideas on &quot;egoism&quot; might lead an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;others-centered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  person (such as, apparently, yourself) to view her ideas this way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I did not say I was others centered. That's preposterous. I said I was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person who loved.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did not mean it as a put down.  As I see it people are essentially 
<BR>
self-centered or others-centered. Given your posts in this thread, it is 
<BR>
obvious you don’t consider yourself a self-centered person.  So I naturally 
<BR>
assumed you were in the other camp.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I love myself. I love things passionately ... thing outside
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;myself: my lover, my family, my smallest closest circle of friends, new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people, things, animals, genres of art, music, TV, books, conversation, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;list...
</EM><BR>
<P>That’s great.  I would say the same things about myself.  In fact I’d go so 
<BR>
far as to say that I have love for everything and everyone, even people that 
<BR>
I’ve never met.  Yet, in the same breath I’d also describe myself as 
<BR>
self-centered.  In my (perhaps twisted) view, the two are not mutually 
<BR>
exclusive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What you mean I assume is healthy self esteem and the ability to draw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;boundaries --  letting religions and manipulative forces use the guilt 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;factor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to cause you to do damaging thing to yourself in the name of altruism. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you're a doormat, may I suggest a codependents anonymous meeting (or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;therapy)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instead of reading about selfish industrialists with gold mines who like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sneer at the masses. It will hone your communication skills to boot.
</EM><BR>
<P>Never been to a codependents anonymous meeting, but my guess is that what 
<BR>
they advocate is not all that far removed from healthy egoism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;IMO we are all born self centered. This is normal, but hopefully we learn 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;curb that impulse when we learn the rest of the world is interactive. Being 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;grabby child at 35 is OK BY ME ... but OFTEN it doesn't serve the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;situation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or infringes on other's boundaries or causes pain to others.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you and I have different ideas of what it means to be self-centered. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Young children are more narcissistic than self-centered.  As I recall, 
<BR>
they view themselves as more important (in fact all-important) than anyone 
<BR>
else.  In much the same way that people once thought that Earth was the 
<BR>
center of the universe and that humans were God’s favorite creation, young 
<BR>
children think that they are the most important creatures in the universe 
<BR>
and that everyone else is here to serve them.  That is immaturity, that is 
<BR>
childishness, that is narcissism.  That is *not* egoism (at least the kind 
<BR>
that Rand advocates).
<BR>
<P>As we mature we realize that others have as much value as we do, and that 
<BR>
they have feelings, dreams and aspirations which are just as important to 
<BR>
them as ours are to ourselves.  I fully realize this.  Yet my goals, values 
<BR>
and aspirations have much more value *to me* than yours do.  I have no 
<BR>
desire to subordinate your desires to mine.  In fact it is my earnest hope 
<BR>
that you reach every one of your goals and that you live a completely 
<BR>
satisfying and fulfilling life.  But to the extent that your reaching that 
<BR>
goal impedes my reaching the same goal for myself, don’t expect any help 
<BR>
from me.
<BR>
<P>I don’t think this makes me a 35 year old grabby child.  It is contrary to 
<BR>
my personal code of ethics for me to infringe on your boundaries or cause 
<BR>
you pain.  I don’t wish you any ill, I have nothing against you (in fact I 
<BR>
*love* you).  But simply, it is more important to me that I reach my own 
<BR>
goals than that you reach yours.  I think this is much different than the 
<BR>
kind of childish selfishness we are all born with.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I am sorry you were raised Christian, I was not.
</EM><BR>
<P>I’m glad I was raised a Christian.  Many of the Judeo-Christian values 
<BR>
instilled in me are still an important part of who I am.  I am glad that I 
<BR>
have love for everyone.  I realize (like Martin Luther King) that there is 
<BR>
real strength to be found in loving your enemies (not to mention the fact 
<BR>
that it tends to leave one with very few enemies).  I do wish these ideals 
<BR>
could have been instilled with out the fairytale aspects of the religion.  
<BR>
But now that I have shed the more irrational aspects of the faith, I feel 
<BR>
that I am much better off having been immersed in it and having transcended 
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Sorry to hear you fell for more dogma.
</EM><BR>
<P>What dogma is that?  Because some of Rand’s ideas on egoism have resonated 
<BR>
with me that means I have fallen for dogma?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The character in the Fountainhead would NEVER have been a follower of dogma
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that's the funny part. Howard Roarke at an objectivists gathering?? bahaha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gimme a break.
</EM><BR>
<P>You must feel that I am some dyed-in-the-wool objectivist.  I am not.  
<BR>
Egoism as discussed by Rand has articulated for me something that makes a 
<BR>
great deal of sense.  Howard Roarke would not shun an idea simply because it 
<BR>
was first articulated by someone else.  Being a creator yourself does *not* 
<BR>
mean that you cannot appreciate something that *you* did not create.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A healthy person does not need to be told to be more selfish, it comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;naturally to love one's self and to have integrity to one's own ego.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps.  But not everyone is quite so “healthy.”  As discussed above, what 
<BR>
comes naturally is childhood narcissism.  While narcissism for a newborn is 
<BR>
natural and healthy, society has decided en masse that adult narcissism is 
<BR>
some sort of sickness.  In order to combat this sickness we are constantly 
<BR>
“vaccinated” with altruistic ideals.  We are told that the best people are 
<BR>
those who suffer for the benefit of others.  The Santa Clauses and Mother 
<BR>
Theresas of the world are praised, the Hitlers and Marie Antoinettes are 
<BR>
killed.  Jesus, who is said to have suffered and died for our sins, is 
<BR>
deified.  He has transmogrified from a simple peasant to the creator of the 
<BR>
universe.
<BR>
<P>Before Rand, virtually all of our societal myths and literature glorified 
<BR>
the selfless do-gooder.  Not everyone can easily resist this constant and 
<BR>
ubiquitous altruistic indoctrination.  Apparently it was cake walk for you.  
<BR>
It was not so easy for me.  For me Rand said “it’s OK to do what *you* think 
<BR>
is good for *you* regardless of what *anyone* else thinks.”  That was 
<BR>
welcome news to me and I am grateful for it.  Perhaps, for you, egoism comes 
<BR>
naturally.  However from your descriptions of your feelings toward Rand and 
<BR>
her ideas, I doubt it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;healthy person also doesn't need THAT much control over others -- or need 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;smugly put-down those who haven't learned to take care of themselves, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;build themselves up with bogus pomposity and leering condescension for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everyone else.
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven’t read all of Rand’s works like you have.  But from what I have read 
<BR>
it didn't seem to me that she advocated asserting control over others.  I 
<BR>
find it hard to believe that she actually advocated “bogus pomposity and 
<BR>
leering condescension.”  If she did, I’d take issue with her on that.  My 
<BR>
guess though is that you are reading this between the lines of what she 
<BR>
actually wrote.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;We don't need to expound the virtue of selfishness any more than we need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expound the virtue of breathing air.
</EM><BR>
<P>Speak for yourself.  Ignoring the ubiquitous doctrinal assault of altruism 
<BR>
apparently comes natural to you.  It does not for everyone.  It did not for 
<BR>
me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Mostly a self absorbed person is truly a bore.
</EM><BR>
<P>You confuse self-absorption with self-centeredness.  I am self-centered.  I 
<BR>
am not self-absorbed.  I enjoy studying and contemplating myself.  But not 
<BR>
nearly as much as I enjoy studying and contemplating other things and ideas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The same shtick goes for everyone. They don't have enough awareness of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;others&quot; to curb their self talk and don't have the people skills/tools to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see how they are being perceived. They test the boundaries of patience in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;polite conversation. Usually they take themselves waaaaay too seriously too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and get annoyed at anyone who tries to bringing in an outside viewpoint.
</EM><BR>
<P>No offense (really), but seems to me it could reasonably be said that your 
<BR>
response to my post fits that description.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;How can you be UTTERLY focused on yourself 100% of the time and find the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;look openly at life outside your own sphere? To be open minded? Listen?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Especially since people are ALWAYS contradicting you, challenging your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ideas,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disagreeing?
</EM><BR>
<P>Again it sounds like you are simply confusing self-centeredness with 
<BR>
self-absorption.  They are *not* synonymous.
