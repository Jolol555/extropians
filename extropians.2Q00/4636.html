<P>FTL travel/infotransfer being impossible seems like a prudent assumption.

Lacking further constraints, the space of magical technologies is too
<BR>
large to be exhaustively sampled. Let's incorporate new data into model as
<BR>
they arise. Otherwise, we can just substitute list traffic from
<BR>
/dev/random output, it would make as much sense.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; an even more extreme sparsity of civilizations - really fast FTL would imply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that ours is the first civilization to achieve the capacity for expansion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into space.
</EM><BR>
<P>Spacetime plumbing is a pretty good filter, because it requires very smart
<BR>
and powerful critters, which subsequently go Elsewhere (especially if you
<BR>
fabricate places to go to by the attempt to go there), a classical
<BR>
population bottleneck.
<BR>
<P>However, no evidence. The jury's still out whether denizens of this
<BR>
universe can fabricate traversible wormholes which go to other places of
<BR>
the same spacetime continuum.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Since expansive aliens expand with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; speeds near to relativistic, there is obviously very little warning,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; before the expansion front hits out system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, 'very little' is a relative thing. An expansion rate of 99.9% C over a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distance of 10^7 LY still gives us 10,000 years of watching the expansion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; move our way. We would only be caught by complete surprise if the expansion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; front moved faster than C.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which, of course, is impossible, as far as we know. 0.999 c is fairly
<BR>
stringent, it is difficult to imagine the culture nanoseed expressing
<BR>
itself explosively upon arrival, and fabricating further panspermia
<BR>
machines and their launchers which can do 0.999 c. Even using starpumped
<BR>
laser sails, braking/maneuvering will be a problem.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for catching the &quot;no warning&quot; bug. SETI should look for spherical
<BR>
infrared voids on galactic cluster scale. While star-hopping is trivial,
<BR>
galaxy hopping might require different propagation mechanisms.
