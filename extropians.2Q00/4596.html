<P>&quot;It's a lovely and terrifying picture: enormous galaxies roll
<BR>
themselves up out of dust at the dawn, the compressed mass at
<BR>
their cores igniting into an infalling cascade of black holes,
<BR>
the orbital surround of the entire central catastrophe *blazing*
<BR>
with quasar ferocity until most of the
<BR>
feedstuff has been swallowed or hurled away.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The poetic eye keenly absorbs a confluence of elements, as the
<BR>
poetic ear often eludes words for the overall musicality of tone
<BR>
and pacing.   Poetry is more than ending sentences with a rhyme.
<BR>
&nbsp;It reveals the essence of an idea, as we marvel at the person
<BR>
unveiling it.  
<BR>
<P>The universe has been a poetic slate for my work—ever since sailing
<BR>
the seas to South America—ever since hiking 33 miles through
<BR>
a volcano under the night sky—ever since training at a pre-astronaut
<BR>
camp simulation.   My last few years as a painter were spent
<BR>
feverishly covering large canvasses with images of our Solar
<BR>
System, and later my videos drew from the universe’s landscape.
<BR>
&nbsp;My first artistic writings on transhumanity have found their
<BR>
way onboard a space probe, and today, I continue to carve images
<BR>
and words like pictoglyphs on the backdrop of our universe. 
<BR>
<P>How wonderful to enjoy Damien’s post.  How wonderful to have
<BR>
friends like Fiorella Terenze who also feels the universe sensuously.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel I’m in brilliant company – that expressing our desires
<BR>
and passions can be done so … shall we say, poetically?  Perhaps
<BR>
it’s as simple as this—that the connection between the arts and
<BR>
sciences is a poetic appreciation—to be emotionally moved—by
<BR>
life and the universe.
