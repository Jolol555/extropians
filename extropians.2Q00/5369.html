John.. perhaps getting &quot;fired&quot; is exactly what you need to do..you may be

more focused on the immediate reality of eating and shelter instead of
<BR>
rumination of inadaquacys, negative yearning and stuckness, a primal state 
<BR>
where the brain is forced into a higher order of dissipation.
<BR>
(end)

<P>Could someone explain to me what the last line means??  I do really 
<BR>
appreciate Robert-Coyote giving me some advice but the last line's meaning 
<BR>
just plain eludes me.
<BR>
<P>I do feel &quot;trapped&quot; in the area of working and providing for my basic needs

but than that is a good thing.  Or else I could become homeless! lol  I

promise you, I do plenty of ruminating over my inadaquacies, negative 
<BR>
yearnings and &quot;stuckness!&quot; ;)
<BR>
<P>And right now the Alcor Life Extension Conference is going on and I am 
<BR>
MISSING it.  When I moved recently(no choice) that drained my finances to 
<BR>
where I could not afford the conference.  I just wish the organizers were 
<BR>
more &quot;compassionate&quot; in sharing transcripts and especially video! :(
<BR>
There is always &quot;next year&quot; but it may never come and there were I am sure 
<BR>
special moments and times at this conference which will never repeat.  What 
<BR>
I really want is the opportunity to schmooze.
<BR>
<P>I am one of those people who don't like leaving my comfort zone and living 
<BR>
in Alaska, my girlfriend and my little job here are a big part of that.  A 
<BR>
part of me wishes I could just go! And perhaps relocate to Seattle or some 
<BR>
part of California.  I don't know...
<BR>
