<P>I think you give de Garis too much credit; his vision of a
<BR>
&quot;gigadeath&quot; war does nothing to address the philosophical
<BR>
and ideological implications of AI.  I think the &quot;threat&quot; of
<BR>
AI can be broken down into two components: that this
<BR>
intelligence is artificial (which, I think you'll agree is
<BR>
needless discrimination), and that this intelligence has the
<BR>
potential to be far more capable than us.  It is the idea
<BR>
that a more capable intelligence should be considered in the
<BR>
same light as nuclear weapons that really disturbs me.  Is
<BR>
there a point where feeling threatened by another person's
<BR>
capabilities becomes a legitimate concern?  (Perhaps if
<BR>
resources were scarce, but even then who is more likely to
<BR>
use them effectively?)
