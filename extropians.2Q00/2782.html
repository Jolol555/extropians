<P>ha, I was about to send this and was looking for excess quotage to cut
<BR>
and saw this  :-)
<BR>
<P>This is really funny, as over here the Liberal Party is the
<BR>
arch-conservative party.
<BR>
But that's as good a description of me as I'll get on this list,
<BR>
compared to a lot of the rants I see here I'm Leon Trotsky himself.   I
<BR>
live in a country where the govt isn't insane, and so I don't have this
<BR>
anti-govt reflex you guys have.  And I'd rather, in general, trust the
<BR>
govt than the general public.
<BR>
<P>In principle I am all in favour of autonomy and anarchism, but my
<BR>
experience is that you really need a population of adults for this to
<BR>
fly, and that just hasn't evolved yet, I'm afraid.
<BR>
<P>anyway, here we go:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, this was my thinking. I'd always thought, based on my very cursory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; knowledge, that he was pro-democracy and all those other funky
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; buzzwords.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, well, a lot of bad guys are buzzword compliant.  :)
</EM><BR>
<P>The world gets trendier by the minute.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, he's a philanthropist, it's true, using his money to promote his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea of what society ought to be like.
</EM><BR>
<P>Like all sorts of crazed oligarchs through the ages.   :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In many cases, most notably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Russia, this has been largely a good thing.  In many other cases, like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty much every US domestic cause he supports, his policies lean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; towards authoritarianism and away from self-direction and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-government.
</EM><BR>
<P>Weird, I've always thought he was in favour of open and accountable
<BR>
govts.
<BR>
Why do you think he is doing this? Does he like the US govt, hate the
<BR>
people, or some other reason?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; His picture of a well-oiled society is one in which the group rules
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the individual, while the group at large controls itself.  He calls
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this autonomy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Like most political issues, I suspect that the devil is in the details
<BR>
and he doesn't see it this way at all. And this is the last place I want
<BR>
to start this discussion, so I'll leave it at that, unless someone wants
<BR>
to send me some URLs to especially bad ideas of his.
