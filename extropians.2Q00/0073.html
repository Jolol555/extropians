RE: <A HREF="http://SecularHumanism.org/library/fi/100_humanist_20.2.htm">http://SecularHumanism.org/library/fi/100_humanist_20.2.htm</A> 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In their spring 2000 issue, the editors of Free Inquiry, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the journal of the Council for Secular Humanism, honor 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Margaret Sanger--who founded Planned Parenthood--by 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;including her efforts in a listing of &quot;100 Humanist 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Events That Changed the World.&quot; Free Inquiry states:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Margaret Sanger opens first birth control clinic 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1916). Pioneered idea that family size should be 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a woman's choice; opposed religious control over 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reproduction, promoted decoupling of reproduction 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the sex act.&quot; (Free Inquiry, 20(2), page 46)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever one may feel about a woman's right to choose 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;an abortion, the fact is that Sanger's efforts were 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not aimed at maximizing free choice, but were instead 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;part of a plan to eliminate human beings, particularly 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;those human beings that Sanger believed were not fit 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to exist. Sanger was a leading proponent of compulsory 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;eugenics, believing that family size should be determined 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not by parents or the Church, but by government planners. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanger advocated &quot;Race Building&quot; and a plan that would 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;relocate a large portion of humanity into concentration 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;camps where they would be prevented from reproducing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;their &quot;unfit&quot; and &quot;degenerate&quot; kind. Sanger outlined her 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;plan for such a monstrous aggression on humanity in her
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;book The Pivot of Civilization [1] and in her journal 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Birth Control Review, [2] which provided a forum for 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;some of the most evil and repugnant features of Nazism.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The slogan on Sanger's journal reads: &quot;Birth Control: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to create a race of thoroughbreds.&quot; Her journal even 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;featured an article by Dr. Ernst Rubin, Adolf Hitler's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;director of genetic sterilization. The very same issue 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of Free Inquiry that praises Sanger highlights on its
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cover an article by Peter Singer, a modern-day Sanger
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(<A HREF="http://secularhumanism.org/fi/covers/spring99a.gif">http://secularhumanism.org/fi/covers/spring99a.gif</A>)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;who believes in killing infants after they're born if
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he determines that the infant would grow up being more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unhappy than happy, such as if the infant was retarded.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no overlap of Nazism and liberty, but there 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is an overlapping of Nazism and social engineering,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which highlights the danger of ideologies that reduce 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;all of humanity to clay to be molded by central planners.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are excerpts from the Birth Control Review
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(posted here <A HREF="http://hli.org/issues/pp/bcreview/index.html">http://hli.org/issues/pp/bcreview/index.html</A>):
<BR>
<P>=============================================================
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Margaret Sanger, &quot;Birth Control and Women's Health.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;Birth Control Review, Dec. 1917, Vol. I, No. 12, page 7:
<BR>
<P>&quot;In the early history of the race, so-called &quot;natural law&quot; 
<BR>
reigned undisturbed. Under its pitiless and unsympathetic iron 
<BR>
rule, only the strongest, most courageous could live and become
<BR>
progenitors of the race. The weak died early or were killed.
<BR>
Today, however, civilization has brought sympathy, pity,
<BR>
tenderness and other lofty and worthy sentiments, which
<BR>
interfere with the law of natural selection. We are now in a
<BR>
state where our charities, our compensation acts, our pensions,
<BR>
hospitals, and even our drainage and sanitary equipment all
<BR>
tend to keep alive the sickly and the weak, who are allowed 
<BR>
to propagate and in turn produce a race of degenerates.&quot;
<BR>
<P>=============================================================
<BR>
Some words Sanger uses to describe those that she deems to be
<BR>
&quot;unfit&quot; for existence are words that evoke loathing and hate.
<BR>
=============================================================
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Margaret Sanger, &quot;The Eugenic Value of Birth Control Propaganda.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;Birth Control Review, Oct. 1921, Vol. V, No. 10, page 5:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Today Eugenics is suggested by the most diverse minds as the 
<BR>
most adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial, 
<BR>
political, and social problems ... As an advocate of Birth
<BR>
Control, I wish to take advantage of the present opportunity 
<BR>
to point out that the unbalance between the birth rate of the 
<BR>
&quot;unfit&quot; and the &quot;fit,&quot; admittedly the greatest present menace 
<BR>
to the human race, can never be rectified by the inauguration 
<BR>
of a cradle competition between the two classes. In this 
<BR>
matter, the example of the inferior classes, the fertility of 
<BR>
the feeble-minded, the mentally defective, the poverty-stricken
<BR>
classes, should not be held up for emulation to the mentally 
<BR>
and physically fit though less fertile parents of the educated 
<BR>
and well-to-do classes. On the contrary, the most urgent 
<BR>
problem today is how to limit and discourage the over fertility 
<BR>
of the mentally and physically defective ... Birth Control is 
<BR>
not advanced as a panacea by which past and present evils of
<BR>
dysgenic breeding can be magically eliminated. Possibly drastic 
<BR>
and Spartan methods may be forced upon society if it continues 
<BR>
complacently to encourage the chance and chaotic breeding that
<BR>
has resulted from our stupidly cruel sentimentalism.&quot;
<BR>
<P>=============================================================
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Margaret Sanger, &quot;Women in Germany.&quot; Birth Control 
<BR>
&nbsp;Review, January 1921, Vol. V, No. 1, page 9:
<BR>
<P>&quot;I visited hospitals in this city, and found them lacking in 
<BR>
the simple and most ordinary article of decency. No soap, no
<BR>
cod-liver oil, no rubber sheets to protect the beds no linen 
<BR>
to give clean bedding as required, and even the babies must 
<BR>
be all day in wet napkins, because of the inadequate supply 
<BR>
for the proper change. This has given rise to skin trouble, 
<BR>
and the poor little waifs are a sad, miserable lot. It would 
<BR>
be a great kindness to let them die outright, I believe.&quot;
<BR>
<P>=============================================================
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Margaret Sanger. &quot;Plan for Peace.&quot; Birth Control Review, 
<BR>
&nbsp;April 1932, Vol. XVI, No. 4, pages 107 - 108:
<BR>
<P>&quot;First, put into action President Wilson's fourteen points,
<BR>
upon which terms Germany and Austria surrendered to the
<BR>
Allies in 1918.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Second, have Congress set up a special department for the
<BR>
study of population problems and appoint a Parliament of
<BR>
Population, the directors representing the various branches 
<BR>
of science: This body to direct and control the population 
<BR>
through birth rates and immigration, and to direct its 
<BR>
distribution over the country according to national needs 
<BR>
consistent with taste, fitness and interest of the individuals.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The main objectives of the Population Congress would be:
<BR>
<P>a. To raise the level and increase the general intelligence 
<BR>
of population.
<BR>
<P>b. To increase the population slowly by keeping the birth rate
<BR>
at its present level of fifteen per thousand, decreasing the 
<BR>
death rate below its present mark of 11 per thousand.
<BR>
<P>c. To keep the doors of immigration closed to the entrance of
<BR>
certain aliens whose condition is known to be detrimental to
<BR>
the stamina of the race, such as feebleminded, idiots, morons,
<BR>
insane, syphilitic, ipileptic, criminal, professional prostitutes,
<BR>
and others in this class barred by the immigration laws of 1924.
<BR>
<P>d. To apply a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and
<BR>
segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is
<BR>
already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable
<BR>
traits may be transmitted to offspring.
<BR>
<P>e. To insure the country against future burdens of maintenance
<BR>
for numerous offspring as may be born of feebleminded parents, 
<BR>
by pensioning all persons with transmissible diseases who 
<BR>
voluntarily consent to sterilization.
<BR>
<P>f. To give certain dysgenic groups in our population their
<BR>
choice of segregation or sterilization.
<BR>
<P>g. To apportion farm lands and homesteads for these
<BR>
segregated persons where they would be taught to work under
<BR>
competent instructors for the period of their entire lives.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The first step would thus be to control the intake and output
<BR>
of morons, mental defectives, epileptics.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The second step would be to take an inventory of the
<BR>
secondary group such as illiterates, paupers, unemployables,
<BR>
criminals, prostitutes, dope-fiends; classify them in special
<BR>
departments under government medical protection, and segregate 
<BR>
them on farms and open spaces as long as necessary for the 
<BR>
strengthening and development of moral conduct.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Having corralled this enormous part of our population and
<BR>
placed it on a basis of health instead of punishment, it is 
<BR>
safe to say that fifteen or twenty millions of our population 
<BR>
would then be organized into soldiers of defense ) defending 
<BR>
the unborn against their own disabilities ...
<BR>
<P>&quot;With the future citizen safeguarded from hereditary taints, 
<BR>
with five million mental and moral degenerates segregated, with 
<BR>
ten million women and ten million children receiving adequate 
<BR>
care, we could then turn our attention to the basic needs for
<BR>
international peace.
<BR>
<P>&quot;There would be a a definite effort to make population increase
<BR>
slowly and at a specified rate, in order to accommodate and
<BR>
adjust increasing numbers to the best social and economic
<BR>
system.
<BR>
<P>&quot;In the meantime we should organize and join an International
<BR>
League of Low Birth Rate Nations to secure and maintain
<BR>
World Peace.&quot;
