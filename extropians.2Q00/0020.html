<EM>&gt;minutes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ago then they should have to type it all in manually. I'll bet it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; take long before they found innovative ways to cut the preamble short

<EM>&gt;and

<EM>&gt; &gt; get to the point.

<EM>&gt;In no time at all you would see replies to messages of the form:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;I still don't agree.&quot;, &quot;What? Explain.&quot; and similarly unhelpful and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;completely context-free posts. I've seen it happen.
</EM><BR>
<P>A proposed common-sense rule: quote *just enough* of the post you're 
<BR>
replying to so that a reader who had not been following the thread could 
<BR>
figure out (1) the author of the original post and (2) the context and 
<BR>
meaning of your reply.  For you code jockeys out there, just analogize it to 
<BR>
optimizing code.  Throw out all the redundant or superfluous lines, and keep 
<BR>
*only* what is needed to make the app do what its supposed to do.  This post 
<BR>
is a good example.
<BR>
<P>In other matters:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Just tried a very cool new, FREE program - GuruNet! It lets you point at 
<BR>
any word, in any Windows program, and, if you're online, it brings you 
<BR>
instant info about that word. Check it out at <A HREF="http://www.gurunet.com">http://www.gurunet.com</A>.&quot;
<BR>
<P>That is the blurb GuruNet gives you to spread the word about their site.  
<BR>
Essentially it acts as an instant dictionary, thesaurus, biographical 
<BR>
dictionary and web search engine for any term you click on.  I highly 
<BR>
recommend their service.  I use it quite a bit and thought others on this 
<BR>
list might find it useful as well.
<BR>
<P>(And no, this is not an April fool's prank.  It's *real* tech.)
