<EM>&gt; &gt;As I've said before, almost everyone I have known personally that has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;visited europe has been robbed at least once while they were there,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they've had their hotel rooms robbed, their cars broken into or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;stolen, and bags snatched out of their hands.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I have heard stories of severe thievery in Europe and on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sophisticated level that dates back centuries. I did not know they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;suffered from apathy when it comes to intervening in situations such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as an ongoing rape.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm having a bit of a disconnect with these statements John. I've been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; living in, and traveling extensively through Europe (8 countries)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; during the last 2 1/2 years, and I've not encountered what you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; described. It would help us if you were more specific on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; locations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, it was me who said the first bit (pre [...]), not John.
<BR>
Locations? Britain (London, Liverpool), Amsterdam, Rome, Venice, Naples,
<BR>
Paris. The apathy toward rape incident occured in London. In Rome my
<BR>
father's rental car was broken into and his camera bag was stolen, mom
<BR>
was pickpocketed in Venice....
