Maybe it is time for those who wish to acquire health and longevity to do 
<BR>
just that?  Let the people who are satisfied with the &quot;natural human 
<BR>
life-span&quot; continue to live with their comfortable thinking.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>This may seem at first to be a good strategy but the problem is we will need 
<BR>
the support of the 'comfortable thinkers' to advance our agenda for the 
<BR>
achievement of superlongevity because of negative public attitudes which may 
<BR>
form, spurred on by certain influential special interest groups.
<BR>
<P>As medical advances in longevity increase so will the resistance to them in 
<BR>
certain quarters of society and these groups may even levy powerful enough 
<BR>
pressure to greatly slow or even stop such research.  And so we must 'get 
<BR>
our memes out' in a way that allows the general public to see things in a 
<BR>
positive light and to lessen the hold opposing groups might have on them.  
<BR>
We cannot afford to just sit back and hope 'things work out for the best.'
<BR>
<P>AI and nanotech are examples of technologies that seem at this point to be 
<BR>
steamrolling forward (given the long view) with corporate and government 
<BR>
desires for profit and power fueling the charge.  But again there could be a 
<BR>
cultural backlash against them and so we must be ready to act and react with 
<BR>
the changing currents of society.
<BR>
<P>We live in an age of powerful special interest groups that can sometimes 
<BR>
very effectively influence public and government attitudes.  The founding of 
<BR>
the Extropy Institute, The Foresight Institute and the Life-Extension 
<BR>
Foundation are in part recognition of this fact.
<BR>
<P>But having a great deal of money really helps this process as the NRA, 
<BR>
Planned Parenthood or the Christian Coalition could attest.  The three 
<BR>
organizations I mentioned formerly have nowhere the funding of the latter 
<BR>
three.  Perhaps there will be some improvement as time goes on.
<BR>
<P>Max More and Natasha-Vita More are good examples of transhumanists trying to 
<BR>
use the media itself to get the word out by appearing on various tv and 
<BR>
radio shows that the public tunes into.  They don't have a hundred million 
<BR>
dollar budget for advertising and lobbying but I still hear about them in 
<BR>
the mass media quite often.  Of course a hundred million dollar budget would 
<BR>
help them out quite a bit.
<BR>
<P>As for the Bell Curve, the book's point about the intelligent congregating 
<BR>
together in communities and work as the 'nobility of a meritocracy' does 
<BR>
make sense to me but other things about that book were very flawed.
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
