<EM>&gt; &gt; Also, in California there is no responsibility to effect a citizens 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arrest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whenever you witness a crime.  In fact you have no obligation whatsoever 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; even call the police.  So long as your conduct does not rise to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; the crime, you can sit back and enjoy the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; entertainment.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The fact that you find the suffering of other innocent human beings to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'entertainment' is rather indicative that you'd prefer to live in an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;empirical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;socity of bread and circuses than a free society of respect and civic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;responsibility.

<P>I did not say that it was my view that the suffering of others it 
<BR>
entertainment for *me*.  I merely used that word to illustrate a point.  You 
<BR>
may not have noticed it yet, but I tend to interject a little irony in my 
<BR>
posts whenever I can.  The fact that *some people* view others' suffering as 
<BR>
entertainment is borne out by the fact that shows like COPS and even 
<BR>
America's Funniest Home Videos are so popular.
<BR>
<P>Although I will admit that a society of &quot;bread and circuses&quot; does sound 
<BR>
pretty cool.  Does that society also include meat and libraries?
