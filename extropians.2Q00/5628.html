Of the several major violent crime categories (assault, rape, murder,
<BR>
armed robbery, etc.) the U.S. has a higher statistical incidence in only
<BR>
one category (murder).  Belgium, Italy, et al. follow a similar pattern. 
<BR>
While there are some exceptions, overall violent crime rates in most
<BR>
European countries met or exceeded those of the U.S. by the mid-90's. 
<BR>
While the U.S. has been enjoying a long-term decline in violent crime
<BR>
rates, the crime rates in many European countries have been experiencing
<BR>
long-term growth.
<BR>
<P>And just as a point of fact, the murder rate in current gun-free Britain is
<BR>
around 50% higher (IIRC) than the murder rate when guns in Britain were
<BR>
totally unregulated.
