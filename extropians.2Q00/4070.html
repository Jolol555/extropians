<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Yes, it's really quite amazing that the intellectually gifted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Carter could be such a dunderhead in the White House, while the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;less intelligent Reagan could be so brilliant.
</EM><BR>
<P>Reaan was a talking head, who was good at reading the lines, and
<BR>
had excellent advisors.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Carter thought that the way to deal with exorbitant oil prices was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to ration gasoline and spend billions of dollars trying to extract
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;petrochemicals from tar sands. Neither scheme worked.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nuclear engineering experience, and a socialist in a capitalist
<BR>
economy....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Reagan let the market set the price of oil, let the US economy go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;through a short, sharp recession to squeeze inflation out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;system, and changed the tax laws to encourage investment. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;current boom is largely the result of this, and could not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;started without Reagan's policies. Bill Clinton's economic success
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;owes to the fact that he left almost all of Reagan's economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;policies intact.
</EM><BR>
<P>That short,sharp recession left me struggling to earn my next meal
<BR>
for almost three years. I've learned my lesson, but doubt America
<BR>
has learned hers....
<BR>
<P>Alan Greenspan is one reason the economy is doing so well, millions
<BR>
of good capitalists the other. If Clinton had been allowed to do
<BR>
the things he wished, (National Health Care amongst others) the
<BR>
economy would be a wreck again. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Carter said &quot;We have overcome our inordinate fear of communism.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Then he was shocked when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was in Taiwan when Carter pulled the China-Over-Taiwan stunt, we
<BR>
we're evacuated by helicopter.....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Reagan called the USSR an &quot;evil empire&quot; and, addressing an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;audience next to the Berlin Wall, said &quot;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this wall.&quot; Two years later, the people tore down the Wall and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Gorbachev was soon kicked out of office.
</EM><BR>
<P>This process was already underway, Reagan had the good fortune to
<BR>
be in the right place at the right time. Of course being on the
<BR>
right side helped. He gets some credit for helping the process
<BR>
along.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Carter wins kudos for being a &quot;great&quot; ex-president. The tragedy is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that Americans had to suffer through the Carter presidency first.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Too bad he couldn't have gone directly from being elected to being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an ex-president. Now this self-righteous, incompetent prig can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;preen and preach all he likes, and we don't have to worry because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;his hands have been safely removed from the levers of power. When
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Carter speaks, I don't bother to listen.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm glad to see he's found something good to do with his time
<BR>
(Habitat for Humanity) he's also done some good running around
<BR>
playing diplomat.
<BR>
<P>We should never confuse serendipity with good acts. Everytime
<BR>
someone mentions Clinton's name and the economy, I ask them to
<BR>
point out one thing (besides retaining Greenspan) he's actually
<BR>
done for it.
