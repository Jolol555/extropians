<P>Yes, I've included my comments, mainly pointing out where the writer is

either forgetting something, or is completely wrong.

<P><EM>&gt; MORALITY OF NATO’S BALKAN VICTORY
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt;             The victors of wars habitually claim that God and morality were on their side, and that they were incapable of committing crimes. Only the anquished are&gt; war criminals deserving of all the punishment. In the Versailles Peace treaty of 1919, at end of the First World War, Germany was punished severely through the&gt; imposition of exorbitant economic reparations. More significantly it was compelled, on French insistence, to accept a “guilt clause.” Some 19,000 soldiers were&gt; identified by the Entente powers as war criminals at the end of the First World War, none of them British, French, Russian, or American.
</EM><BR>
<P>My comments:
<BR>
The American Army regularly punished its own who were found by courts
<BR>
martial to have committed war crimes, though I cannot speak for the
<BR>
British, French, or Russian armies (note that the Russian Army had
<BR>
pulled out of the war in 1917 after the Bolshevik Revolution and signed
<BR>
their own armistice with Germany separate from that of the western
<BR>
allies, one that included no guilt clause, and which made no demands for
<BR>
war crimes to be punished, indeed, the Bolsheviks punished the Czarist
<BR>
army officers themselves far more harshly than any other army officers
<BR>
were in the other armies, including the Germans.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       The atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the firebombing of Tokyo and Yokohama, the demolition of Dresden along with its civilians, were not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subject to war crimes trials. The destruction of the people and land of Vietnam over a period of ten years in the name of freedom are all but forgotten. There were no&gt; apologies made or compensations paid, but instead the Vietnamese were subjected to American economic sanctions for the next quarter-century. 
</EM><BR>
<P>My comments:
<BR>
Strategic carpet bombing of cities that contained defense facilities was
<BR>
considered by the US to be barbaric, at least in europe, which is why
<BR>
the US Army Air Forces all used the secret Norden bombing sight for far
<BR>
more precise bombing attacks on true military targets, while the
<BR>
british, who bombed at night, continued to use carpet bombing due to
<BR>
their bombers innacuracy, and the navigational limitations of flying at
<BR>
night. Carpet bombing of Japanese targets by the US was considered
<BR>
unfortunate, but considering the psychotic fanatical loyalty to the
<BR>
emperor of most Japanese people at the time, it was considered
<BR>
necessary, and considering the lack of respect for the Laws of War that
<BR>
the Japanese showed toward the Chinese people for eight years of prior
<BR>
warmaking, it was obvious they did not care to operate by the laws of
<BR>
war. Considering the lack of respect for human rights shown by the
<BR>
Germans for Jews, Gypsies, Catholics, Ukrainians, and others, it seems
<BR>
obvious in retrospect that the Germans had no reasonable expectation to
<BR>
see the allies respect the human rights that the Germans dismissed so
<BR>
willfully.
<BR>
<P>Likewise, in Vietnam, the US was assisting an internationally recognised
<BR>
government fight an insurgency backed by a foreign power (North Vietnam,
<BR>
Russia, and China). That the North Vietnamese Communists and the
<BR>
southern geurrilla communists refused to operate by the Laws of War when
<BR>
it was inconvenient for them to do so, but willingly hid behind them
<BR>
when it was to their advantage shows that they were not to be trusted to
<BR>
obey any international convention, and the fact they treated captured
<BR>
soldiers and pilots not as prisoners of war should be treated under the
<BR>
Geneva Conventions, but instead labeled them as 'pirates' and 'air
<BR>
pirates' so that they could legally torture, maim, brutalize, and kill
<BR>
with impunity, as well as the fact that the southern viet cong
<BR>
guerrillas frequently attacked completely peaceful civilian targets,
<BR>
non-combatants, and hospital facilities with terrorist bombs illustrates
<BR>
that they had and have no right to claim any sort of victimhood under
<BR>
the Laws of War.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       As the Gulf War drew to its close and Iraq accepted an initial cease-fire that the US rejected, American and British bombers continued to kill thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Iraqi soldiers fleeing across the open desert with no defense. This does not qualify as a “Srebrenica.” And nobody will know how many wounded Iraqi soldiers were&gt; buried alive in the sand by American military bulldozers after the cease-fire because it was too much hassle to check every body lying in the sand.
</EM><BR>
<P>My Comments:
<BR>
The Iraqis did not accept a cease fire until a full day AFTER the US
<BR>
declared unilateral cease fire had gone into effect. The US declared
<BR>
that it would cease operations at a given time and date, and the Iraqis
<BR>
did not respond until after US combat operations ceased. To counter the
<BR>
claims of the author, we will never know how many Kuwaiti women were
<BR>
saved from short lives as pleasure prisoners of Iraqi military units due
<BR>
to the air power induced panic imposed on the Iraqi forces. The raping
<BR>
and pillaging that the Iraqis committed on the Kuwaiti people, IMHO,
<BR>
obviated any moral requirement that the Iraqi soldiers be treated with
<BR>
any respect that normal soldiers deserve. Those soldiers were not
<BR>
unarmed, they were not non-combatants. Any who surrendered were given
<BR>
sanctuary, safety, shelter and food (which is far more than they
<BR>
received when they were released back to the Iraqi high command, who had
<BR>
most shot). Under the Laws of War, any armed soldier is a legitimate
<BR>
target, irrespective if he is charging or retreating. A wild dog who
<BR>
flees is just as likely to come back for another nip if you don't break
<BR>
him of the habit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Some 1.7 million&gt; innocent Iraqis, mainly children, have died slow deaths because of economic sanctions. But there are no CNN cameras to record this tragedy, and besides they died&gt; because of well-intentioned US policy. Such pain, suffering and tragedy do not count in the American concept of morality. Meanwhile, Iraq is bombed routinely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; killing untold numbers of soldiers manning military installations or merely sleeping in their barracks, together with other “unintended” Iraqi civilians. These do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; count as war crimes. They are legitimate targets or collateral damage.
</EM><BR>
<P>yes they are. The children who die cannot be blamed on us. Saddam is
<BR>
quite free to import however much food and medicine as he desires.
<BR>
Unfortunately, he turns around and sells that food and medecine on the
<BR>
black market to generate money to pay for more weapons, weapons systems,
<BR>
and for building his weapons of mass destruction. This silly argument is
<BR>
much like the terrorist who shoots a hostage and says to the
<BR>
negotiator,&quot;Look at what you made me do.&quot;
