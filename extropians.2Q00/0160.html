<P><EM>    &gt;killing the person and replacing her with a copy is a mere description of
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the physical facts in this case.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mere? Call me a Silly Billy if you want but I tend to think that's rather important,
<BR>
especially the physical fact of the copy saying nothing has changed and he's
<BR>
still the same person.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;The paradoxes arise from the unjustifiable claims about identity.
</EM><BR>
<P>I asked before I'll ask again, name one paradox.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;There is no paradox as long as you stick to describing physical facts.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are correct sir.
<BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;But in that case, you are unlikely to entice many people into being
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;killed and duplicated.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps, but It works for me.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; But two copies can be made, or arbitrarily many.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. Apparently you think this is a &quot;paradox&quot;, I reserve that word for
<BR>
things that are logically contradictory, being strange is not enough.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;So which one do &quot;you  wake up in&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>If you ask them they will all say they are you, 5 minutes later they will still say
<BR>
they are all you but now all will also say they are not the same person as all
<BR>
those other fellows who were duplicated. As I said before nobody will ever be
<BR>
able to prove them true or false but I see no compelling reason to assume that
<BR>
all of them are lying all of the time. I think it's probably true.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;I have proven that it is false.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yea, and I invented the internet.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;I EXIST NOW.  This fact is completely unambiguous.
</EM><BR>
<P>By &quot;I&quot; do you mean a few hundred pounds of protoplasm?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;The extension of my identity over time is unambiguous also
</EM><BR>
<P>The only reason you think that is because you have memories of the past,
<BR>
but that just means your brain is in a certain state at the present time.
<BR>
It all seems a little ambiguous to me.                                  ^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
<P><EM>          &gt;&gt;ME:
</EM><BR>
<EM>          &gt;&gt;Matter (and energy) are generic but we know from personal experience that
</EM><BR>
<EM>          &gt;&gt;minds are not.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;generic.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>One hydrogen atom is as good as another.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Information does not exist in the same sense as matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly my point.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;You cannot have disembodied information as your stand-in
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;for the disembodiable mobile soul.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who said anything about &quot;disembodied&quot;, the information is incorporated
<BR>
into a computer made of matter, but matter is generic so it's the information
<BR>
that makes the difference, the matter can come from anywhere.
