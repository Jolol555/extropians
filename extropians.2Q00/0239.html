<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I am urgently in need of some advice from someone who has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experience in recovering damaged magentic digital data storage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;media.  In particular, I need to know about the practical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capabilities of reading data from 9-track and 8 mm tape that has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been submerged for as much as 24 hours in dirty water. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While I appreciate the informed opinions of the many tech-savvy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;folks on the list to the effect of &quot;it should be no problem&quot;, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;REALLy need to talk to someone who actually does this kind of work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or who can get me in touch with someone who has done it.  Any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;practical leads would be greatly appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<P>Greg,
<BR>
<P>I never done the kind of tape you describe, but I have rescued
<BR>
cassette tapes, 8-track tapes, radio's, color TV's, computers, and
<BR>
countless telephones from water and coffee/soft drink spills. I
<BR>
recovered a housefull of electronics after the great Chicago flood
<BR>
of a few years back, when stores downtown had big flood sales.
<BR>
<P>The first step is to get it clean of the gunk. the only thing to
<BR>
use for this is distilled water, preferably de-ionized.
<BR>
<P>I use a cheap plastic squeeze bottle I bought from a surplus
<BR>
medical store (I paid a buck). This is preferable to simply
<BR>
immersing the thing in water, but do that if you have too, the
<BR>
essential thing is to get the gunk off.
<BR>
<P>Since the tape was only immersed most of it was spooled fairly
<BR>
tight and should be unaffected. partially disasemble or drill small
<BR>
holes in the case if you have to.
<BR>
<P>Next most important is to dry it carefully, drain and carefully
<BR>
blot dry every part you can. Q-tips and compressed air cans work
<BR>
well for this. Warm air is okay but not HOT!
<BR>
<P>Once its dry, copy the data immediately on to new media.
<BR>
<P>If all else fails the expert on this is Scott Mueller of Mueller
<BR>
and associates in Barrington Ill. Scott wrote a bokk on &quot;Data
<BR>
Recovery&quot; as well as the best selling computer book ever written
<BR>
&quot;Upgrading and repairing PC's&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Good Luck!
<BR>
