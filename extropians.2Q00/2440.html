<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Its not that I don't believe there are such things as victimless crimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (sodomy between consenting adults comes to mind), but when you think 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the ultimate effect of many so-called victimless crimes, you begin to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that society itself is the victim many times.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; For instance, taking your example of smoking.  No one is harmed by the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that you smoke cigarettes, right?  Well, even putting aside the obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; problem of second hand smoke, what happens when you come down with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; emphysema?  On the off hand chance that you have sufficient private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; insurance (or money) to cover your own medical care, then the only 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;victims
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (besides your own stupid self) are those who care about you and suffer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; seeing you suffering to death.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its been proven quite well by the Veterans Administration studying the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;health care costs of smoking and nonsmoking veterans over their adult
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lives in service and retired that smoking REDUCES total medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expenditures.
</EM><BR>
<P>Got refs for that stat?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; In the more likely scenario where some form of public insurance is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;needed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; supplement your medical care, the victims of your &quot;victimless&quot; crime are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(1)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you, (2) those who care about you, and (3) taxpayers like me who are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;paying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for your expensive medical care.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;How does my family financially suffer from my death?
</EM><BR>
<P>When did I ever say anything about *financial* suffering.  I was talking 
<BR>
about the suffering of watching a man that they (presumably) love suffer 
<BR>
with a horrible illness and die a miserable death.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My family
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deserves NO money from me, get it? Where does it say I am obligated to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;let them inherit anything?
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, and *I'm* the fascist?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For the record, I don't smoke.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not tobacco, at least.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;If you cooperate with the present US Government to a greater extent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;to protect your own safety (i.e. paying to taxes to stay out of jail is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;OK, but buying T-Bills is not), you are morally complicit in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;atrocities committed by that government.  One MILLION Americans are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;rotting in prison having harmed no person or property; armed agents of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;the government routinely confiscate billions of dollars worth of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;without trial or even accusation; thousands of immigrants are collected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;and returned to more oppressive governments; if that's not tyrrany, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;what is?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Suggestion: go live for a few years in Afghanistan, then a couple more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in Iran, then Iraq.  Then come back and tell me all about how 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;tyrannical&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the US is.  No matter how &quot;tyrannical&quot; the US is, they never force you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stay if you don't like it.  So if its so bad, pick up stakes and go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; somewhere else.  Or is every single nation on the planet a tyranny in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; eyes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The US government does not have preemminent right to be here.
</EM><BR>
<P>What does that mean?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I did not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;take an oath to protect it, nor have I taken any oath of fealty to it. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have not subsumed my rights to it. It exists as consequence of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;permission, not the other way around, no matter how much you would like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to beleive.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, if you decide the US can't stay here, what?  It has to go away?

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;BTW, Zero, Mr. Open Society, what's your real name?  ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As I've said before, my birth name is not a secret.  It is Michael.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Zero is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only a nick.  Nicknames are not incompatible with truth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Identity is mandatory to recognise truth, as truth is worthless without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trust. What is your last name? Who are you?
</EM><BR>
<P>My name (for the I-don't-know-how-manyth time) is Michael Powers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What are you hiding?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not *hiding* anything.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Who do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you work for?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am self employed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Are you a convict?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Are you a sexual predator?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Are you a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fugitive?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Are you a communist or socialist?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As Mr. Zero, you opinion has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an equal amount of credibility: zero.
</EM><BR>
<P>It will not hurt my feelings if you choose not to give any credence to my 
<BR>
opinions because I go by a nickname (or for any other reason for that 
<BR>
matter).  It will also not hurt my feelings in the least if you killfiled me 
<BR>
and never responded to another one of my posts, ever.  When I post to this 
<BR>
list I expect my opinions to stand or fall on their own merits, not on who I 
<BR>
am or who people think I am.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've posted this info before, and you've been too much of a spineless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;coward to follow through on your commitment.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't recall ever making a committment to you in my life.  If my logic 
<BR>
holds, its likely that I never will.  If you posted this info to me before, 
<BR>
it was probably during the time that I had you in my killfile.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Put up or shut up. Post
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your identity, fascist, or else retire from the field for good. I'm all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for mutuality, mainly because I expect to find out some really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interesting information when I find out who you really are. The fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that you won't disclose this indicates that you know you have something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to hide, so you are too cowardly to meet your own standard.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, you can call me a &quot;coward&quot; if you like, but I tell my kids all the 
<BR>
time that it is stupid to give out personal information about yourself to 
<BR>
people you don't know.  I think that rule applies equally well to adults as 
<BR>
to kids.  I don't know you.  I have doubts about your judgment.   You, 
<BR>
frankly, seem way too interested in learning as much about me as possible.  
<BR>
To be honest, that concerns me.  What little I do know about you does not 
<BR>
incline me in the least to share any personal information with you other 
<BR>
than my name (Michael Powers) and what I have told you about me above.  If 
<BR>
this leads you to no longer want to discourse with me, as stated above, I 
<BR>
can live with that.  My advice: get yourself a life.
<BR>
