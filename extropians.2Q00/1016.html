</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True, though one thing that Libertarians do all too often is run for Federal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offices without having candidates for local offices.  A lot of people I talk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to vote not so much for who they want, but for who they think can win and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; closer to their views.  (I.e., they already narrow it down to two choices.)
</EM><BR>
<P>That's another thing I and the LP have to fight--the irrational, stupid,
<BR>
counterproductive, and dangerous idea that there is some value in voting
<BR>
for someone with a chance of winning.  You'd think people would understand
<BR>
the difference between a vote and a bet: you don't lose your bet or
<BR>
anything else when your voted choice doesn't win the office.  You only
<BR>
lose when your preference is not expressed--and there's no better way to
<BR>
utterly fail to express a preference than to vote for a front-runner you
<BR>
don't like and have your vote lost in the landlslide.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One can complain, but it just shows that the current system is not stupid or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dead.  It has to be outwitted -- not just bemoaned -- if you wish to win.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Adrian Tymes in another post makes some good points on this.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you think it's that easy, do it.  Nice of you to just cast aside an
<BR>
organization with thousands of members and 20 years experience.  The party
<BR>
is not the incompetent little startup it was 20 years ago; it is now an
<BR>
experienced, capable, political machine fighting an uphill battle.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Building up relationships with journalists is important too.  A lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Libertarians just expect to get covered, but it takes a lot more than that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and an LP candidate is always going to start with this handicap.  One can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complain and continue to lose or do something about it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now you're just talking out of your ass--you have no idea of the amount
<BR>
of work we've been doing.  Harry and the rest of us have worked long and
<BR>
hard, and spent lots of money, building relationships with journalists and
<BR>
spoon-feeding and supporting the press in every way imaginable.  When we
<BR>
are not covered, it's because the press is deliberately choosing not to
<BR>
cover us, not because they don't know or haven't been coddled like the
<BR>
spoiled brats they are.
<BR>
<P>And we're the only party that explicitly does NOT &quot;expect&quot; to be covered,
<BR>
because we believe in the free press even when they let us down.  We did
<BR>
not join in Nader's lawsuit to demand debate inclusion, because we believe
<BR>
that we should earn our way in, and we've done everything that can be
<BR>
done with the resources we have to make that happen.
