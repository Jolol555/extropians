<EM>&gt; I just read an email from you on the Extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mailing list about Mother
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Teresa.  You said that you're a Zen Budhist and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; staunch athiest??  Those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two aren't contradictory?  I admit that I know much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of nothing about Zen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Budhism.  Can you give me a bit of enlightenment?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks!

<P><P>Hi Terry!
<BR>
<P>And, in answer to your question : It would be my
<BR>
honor, Boddhisattva!  You must forgive the brevity of
<BR>
this response as I am a college student who is
<BR>
currently (i.e. at this moment) working on overdue
<BR>
projects in physics and philosophy for school  ;-)
<BR>
Zen Buddhism and atheism are not inherently
<BR>
contradictory.  In fact, in purest form, the latter is
<BR>
an essential (read &quot;denotational&quot;) characteristic of
<BR>
the former.  Perhaps because Western religion is
<BR>
staunchly theological in not only its metaphysic, but
<BR>
in its ethic, we assume this to be a universal trait
<BR>
of spiritual life.  [note also the various shades and
<BR>
nuances of the terms &quot;religious&quot; and &quot;spiritual&quot; -
<BR>
which means what?]  This, however, does not have to be
<BR>
true.  While I will grant (and, indeed, it is
<BR>
*essential* to note) that all spiritual traditions
<BR>
contain a mystical/supernatural component in an least
<BR>
some of their cultural incarnations, we must notice
<BR>
and acknowledge that this is an adaptive feature of
<BR>
the meme construct in which they are incarnated - not
<BR>
necessarily a rudimentary feature of the &quot;spirituality
<BR>
algorithm&quot; itself [author's note : to all of you who
<BR>
want to smack me for my poor choice of terminology *as
<BR>
you see it* (and, I know you do because it's driving
<BR>
me crazy!), I beg you to chalk the inadequacy up to a
<BR>
&quot;Sapir-Whorfesque linguistic indeterminacy&quot; and not to
<BR>
the intellectual failings of a poor, budding academic
<BR>
who gives so heroically of his sparse time to maintain
<BR>
a relevant voice among the philosophical kin he loves
<BR>
so much  ;-].  
<BR>
What I mean by that (i.e. everything before my little
<BR>
note) is that some religions (and, I use that term
<BR>
quite intentionally here) more fruitfully avail
<BR>
themselves of the ability to detach their philosophy
<BR>
from their theology.  This process is least painful to
<BR>
those religions whose theology has not been
<BR>
systematically, ritually dogmatized by lineages of
<BR>
self-aggrandizing social climbers...(and, before we
<BR>
all start snickering at my little pot-shot at
<BR>
Christianity, let's realize that it has a frightening
<BR>
latitude of applicability!).  Those religions (or,
<BR>
more accurately, minority segments of religious
<BR>
tradtion) which have avoided, through various
<BR>
mechanisms, the friendly embrace of social sanction
<BR>
(which ultimately becomes the death grip of dogmatism)
<BR>
have unwittingly immunized themselves to a broad and
<BR>
virulent class of theo-ethical memes.  Thus, while
<BR>
their compatriots lay wounded on the battlefield of
<BR>
skeptical insight (perhaps having sustained a direct
<BR>
hit from the endless volley of merciless logic), those
<BR>
religious systems whose *command* (i.e.
<BR>
epistemological) structure is unencumbered by the dead
<BR>
weight of supernatural speculation retreat unscathed.
<BR>
Thus enter Zen.  Though it could be argued that all
<BR>
Buddhism is either : 1) inherently atheistic (hard
<BR>
stance) or 2) culturally/ethically sustainable outside
<BR>
of mystical tradition (soft stance), it is far more
<BR>
interesting to study the Mahayana-&gt;Chan-&gt;Zen religious
<BR>
lineage and its legendary rejection of dogma/theology
<BR>
as, if not untrue, at least peripheral to the key
<BR>
spiritual experience.  [note : this is one of the rare
<BR>
occasions when my unparalleled skill for metaphorical
<BR>
philandering, solipsistic rhetoric, and shameless
<BR>
pedantry does not do justice to the profound
<BR>
significance of the insight which it describes.] 
<BR>
Thus, Zen becomes the ideal ethical/spiritual system
<BR>
(which, referring back to the earlier statement, is
<BR>
the definition I choose for a &quot;religion&quot; : &quot;a
<BR>
coherent, stable/sustainable structure of
<BR>
ethical/spiritual principles with both suggestive and
<BR>
predictive power.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>Where's the god??  Hello?  Oh well...Zen, meet
<BR>
atheism.  Atheism, Zen.
<BR>
;-)
<BR>
<P>Best wishes from my &quot;Zen wrapped bubble of cosmic
<BR>
orgasm&quot; (Pelletier, 2000),
