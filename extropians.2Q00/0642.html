<EM>&gt; It is standard practice in the establishment media to demonize so-called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;terrorists&quot;.  This demonization, which should be understood as a form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propaganda, is so consistent and so thorough that it comes to be accepted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as established fact--the common truth.  People in the power establishment,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and particularly those in the military, have so internalized these &quot;truths&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that their logic no longer deals with the actual facts, and is therefor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stymied.  Thus, the mystery.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The truth is easy: they are real people, with a real point of view, with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real agenda, who are involved in a political relationship with a sovereign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power far more powerful than they are.  The relationship is adversarial and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; belligerent, and in that mode, violence is an instrument of policy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Violence has such an amplifying--though dangerous--effect, that a small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; group gets &quot;big&quot; influence from its application.  A clear fact, though not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a nice one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Though demonization might lead the average media consumer to believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;terrorist madmen&quot; are inclined to indiscriminate mass-murder, the truth is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far less dramatic: like any entity exercising that large independence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action ordinarily the province only of sovereignty, a group in rebellion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against an established regime will take whatever action, violent or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-violent, they believe will advance their agenda.
</EM><BR>
<P>And if their agenda is the eradication of all who do not share their
<BR>
beliefs?  Such is not unheard of.  In fact, it's pretty much a
<BR>
stereotype, though it holds more than a grain of truth.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I expect that there are some non-politicized scholarly treatments of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subject &quot;out there&quot;, perhaps even some recent ones--it's been awhile since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I read up on the subject--but you're not likely to find them in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mainstream press.  In fact, the absence of them in the mainstream press
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be interpreted as a sign of what such studies find--ie, something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inconsistent with the mainstream message.
</EM><BR>
<P>Or it could just be that no one's really bothered to explore that field,
<BR>
at least no one who broadcasts their results.  Also consider that, as
<BR>
much as we might demonize terrorists, a number of terrorists tend to
<BR>
demonize everybody else, and possibly to greater heights because they
<BR>
don't have as many allies (or, at least, non-enemies) who are similar to
<BR>
the &quot;demons&quot; that they might otherwise have to justify sparing.  The US
<BR>
and company were willing to accept the surrender of Iraqi forces when
<BR>
they liberated Kuwait, but those same forces, if the tide of victory
<BR>
were reversed, may well have seen heathens and heretics as their enemy -
<BR>
demons to be executed, rather than humans to be spared a violent death
<BR>
if possible.
<BR>
<P>There is little question that, somewhere on this Earth, there is at
<BR>
least one person who would prefer if we were dead - each of us for a not
<BR>
completely identical set of reasons, perhaps, and different numbers of
<BR>
antagonists per person as a result, but at least one nevertheless.  This
<BR>
person most likely does not know us personally; they just wish that all
<BR>
members of a hated group would die, and we happen to belong to that
<BR>
group.  For instance: anyone who uses the Internet (and thus by some
<BR>
peoples' perceptions *must* be a child pornographer, and thus a suitable
<BR>
murder target) raise your hand...
<BR>
<P>The question is: with everyone wanted dead by someone, why do so many
<BR>
people fail to be killed every day?
