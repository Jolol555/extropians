<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) If you are trying to dazzle her, then she might not find the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; space or opportunity to state her opinion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;...how do you reach this possibility?  Getting her to state her opinions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is the purpose of the above.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Getting&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are you in a hurry?
</EM><BR>
<P>Misunderstanding: I meant &quot;getting&quot; as in &quot;getting it to happen at
<BR>
all&quot;, not &quot;getting it to happen faster than it normally would&quot; (except
<BR>
insofar as &quot;a finite amount of time&quot; is faster than &quot;never&quot;).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The joy of learning about people is creating an enviroment where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things unfold naturally.  People reveal themselves in their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way, and in their own time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why not plant seeds and observe (really observe) and ask questions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here and there and see where they lead?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm.  We must be interacting with different classes of people.
<BR>
<P>When I get to know someone, it is usually through a series of
<BR>
conversations; &quot;dates&quot; with potential romantic interests only happen
<BR>
after months of interaction.  I try to plant seeds as you say, but they
<BR>
rarely go anywhere, dismissed with the reaction of, &quot;I couldn't possibly
<BR>
understand or achieve that, so I'm not even going to try&quot;.  It is *that*
<BR>
- the unwillingness to open oneself to new possibilities, nearly
<BR>
universal among those I interact with except in forums like this (which
<BR>
I seek out to remind myself that an open mind is not insanity) - that
<BR>
disappoints.
<BR>
<P>(On a slightly off-topic note, I wonder if this is behind what they call
<BR>
the &quot;Digital Divide&quot;: those who seek out new ways of doing things,
<BR>
possibly on their own or possibly repeating someone else's experiments,
<BR>
prosper; those who are unwilling to do so, even on a limited scale if
<BR>
they have severely limited means, wither.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You could try drawing the girl out by imaginging that she is your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sister that you have not seen in 10 years, and you're genuinely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interested in learning how her life has been all these years. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be a warmer enviroment with which to learn about each other.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which works if you're dealing with people whose lives change over that
<BR>
period of time.  Yours and mine do, and the evidence I see leads me to
<BR>
believe that most peoples' do, even *must*.  But to give an example: the
<BR>
last woman I dated had basically been supporting her household for the
<BR>
past 10 years (not as much when she was 15, but moreso now that she is
<BR>
25).  Her mother could earn enough, but has put more and more pressure
<BR>
on her daughters to support her, and has threatened physical violence on
<BR>
the rest if any of them dares move away.  The daughter in question
<BR>
refuses to do a thing to free herself from said circumstances, even
<BR>
though they have prevented her from following through on her dream of
<BR>
being an artist.
<BR>
<P>After running into several situations like that - when I dig a little,
<BR>
those who attracted my interest with their potential turn out to have
<BR>
given up on realizing it - I tend not to look too hard any longer.
<BR>
(Though, as was said, it may be that the only reason I was looking to
<BR>
begin with was external pressure.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I wrote my previous message in order to show that the approach that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've seen/experienced used alot by bright guys might seem to the woman to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a bit arrogant and overwhelming. She's observing  and filtering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (quite a lot) too, but her interests, methods (and goals)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are likely to be different.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;nods&gt;  It doesn't just apply to bright guys, though.  The distinction
<BR>
is, which do one place a higher value on: learning about her/him, or
<BR>
boasting about oneself?  People usually like to talk about themselves.
<BR>
Make someone believe they are of interest to you in and of themselves
<BR>
(not strictly as a tool to accomplish your own agenda), and you can
<BR>
usually make at least a friend.  (Right?)
