<BR>
<P>I don't owe anybody anything, of course, but I've been doing something
<BR>
that's bad for me and in a small way bad for the
<BR>
Transhumanist/Extropian community. Apologizing to myself feels
<BR>
insubstantial, so I'm apologizing to you. I periodically disappear from
<BR>
all fora and stop reading even the list that I myself run. I get
<BR>
overwhelmed by everthing that's going on, all the information that
<BR>
comes pouring in. Maybe I'm afraid of succeeding at what I most want to
<BR>
do.
<BR>
<P>I live in Ann Arbor, MI, and the nearest active &gt;H/Ex people I know of
<BR>
are in adjoining states. So, when I disappear, I really do disappear
<BR>
and there's nobody around to remind me to come back.
<BR>
<P>My latest disappearance started shortly after Extro4, and caused some
<BR>
promising leads that started at the conference to fade. If you spoke to
<BR>
me then and I said I'd do something for you (or vice versa) I'd still
<BR>
like to follow up on that if I can. Please reply to me directly. If you
<BR>
have problems or questions about <A HREF="mailto:transhuman@logrus.org?Subject=Re:%20Apology&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.GSO.4.21.0005291654360.7850-100000@jane.itd.umich.edu&gt;">transhuman@logrus.org</A>, it's a safe bet
<BR>
that I haven't read them. However, in a further message I have some
<BR>
information that may pre-empt those questions, so hold on.
<BR>
<P>Sasha's passing saddens me of course, and jolts me out of this latest
<BR>
bout of apathy and laziness. I feel lucky to have at least met him in
<BR>
person at Extro4, and wish I had gotten to know him better. I will miss
<BR>
him. In a crude sort of way, Sasha *has* been uploaded-- the wetware
<BR>
and kernel OS may be gone, but the application software that ran on it
<BR>
lives on. It is happily running on hundreds, and perhaps someday
<BR>
millions of wetware platforms. Us. The source code has been preserved
<BR>
forever in the form of mailing list archives and mirrored web pages.
<BR>
Maybe somebody will even compile his postings into some kind of 'best
<BR>
of Sasha' document. This is no substitute for true immortality, but
<BR>
it's something, and the world is better off for Alexander Chislenko
<BR>
having been in it.
<BR>
<P>I am back, and ready to once again bite off several orders of magnitude
<BR>
more than I can chew. For how long, I don't know.  All I can promise is
<BR>
that I'll try to give fair warning and an explanation the next time I
<BR>
feel the urge to vanish from the &gt;H/Ex scene.
<BR>
<P>Thank you for being who you are-- the most fascinating people I've ever
<BR>
had the honor of meeting. As always, if you're travelling anywhere near
<BR>
Ann Arbor, MI, drop me a line. I'll utterly dazzle you with dinner time 
<BR>
conversation and hook you up with a free place to stay.
