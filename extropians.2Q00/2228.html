Im interested in how the cryonics crowd will see this red light camera
<BR>
business.  If one is young, healthy, and has no dangerous habits, the
<BR>
most likely cause of death (seems to me anyway) is being T-boned
<BR>
in an intersection by some crazed yahoo burning the red light.  Yes I have
<BR>
heard the argument that those who would trade freedom for security
<BR>
lose both, but in this particular case, I dont see how that applies.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, Lockheed Martin is setting up cameras in intersections
<BR>
to catch red light runners, and in return, they get a cut of the proceeds.
<BR>
Seems only natural that LM should have a say in *where* their cameras
<BR>
are aimed.  Law enforcement agencies have their goals, Lockheed
<BR>
Martin has theirs: profit.  LM gives not a damn who is trading drugs
<BR>
on the streetcorner, or who is getting mugged, they want PROFIT!
<BR>
<P>This puts an entirely new spin on the law enforcement vs. privacy
<BR>
issue: if there is money to be made, privacy issues get run over like
<BR>
daisies before the steam roller, and this time the motive is at least
<BR>
one we fully understand and perhaps agree with.  {8-|

<BR>
<P>RED LIGHT CAMERAS: A lot of people are upset at Virginia Gov. James S.
<BR>
Gilmore III because he declared April &quot;Confederate History Month.&quot; The state
<BR>
NAACP has even threatened an economic boycott along with protests and
<BR>
rallies. I'm not crazy about Confederate History Month, either. But I can
<BR>
live with it. Harder to take is the ominous increase in traffic surveillance
<BR>
systems--red-light cameras, as they are called--and Jim Gilmore, God bless
<BR>
him, has been one of the few leaders in our area to oppose them. I'd rather
<BR>
see African Americans support Gilmore in his defense of privacy than to
<BR>
cripple him with boycotts for celebrating ghosts from a lost war. The truth be
<BR>
told,
<BR>
Robert E. Lee can't hurt us anymore. On the other hand, a technology-driven
<BR>
law enforcement apparatus, in service to a citizenry that is weary from a
<BR>
perception of high crime rates, can do serious harm--especially to African
<BR>
Americans, who are still widely perceived as a major cause of our national
<BR>
discontent. &quot;Using cameras in open streets raises a serious concern
<BR>
regarding our individual freedom,&quot; Gilmore said last week. Disappointingly, the
<BR>
<P>strongest proponents of this move toward &quot;friendly fascism&quot; appear to be
<BR>
Democrats,
<BR>
including some relatively liberal and likable ones such as D.C. Mayor
<BR>
Anthony A. Williams. Williams has said he favors the cameras because they cut
<BR>
down
<BR>
on red-light runners. But you have to wonder if that's the only reason the
<BR>
District's former chief financial officer is so turned on. His 2001 budget, for
<BR>
<P>instance, estimates that the city's red-light program will increase traffic
<BR>
fine
<BR>
revenue by $16 million this year, and $14.5 million in future years. The most
<BR>
sensible
<BR>
voices on this matter have been Republicans, including D.C. Council member
<BR>
Carol Schwartz. In a recent letter to Mayor Williams, she asked for a review
<BR>
of all red-light camera operations &quot;to judge whether or not cameras are truly
<BR>
in place to deter red-light running, or to be a revenue maker.&quot; &quot;I would also
<BR>
like to know if Lockheed Martin has input into the locations of red-light
<BR>
cameras,&quot;
<BR>
she wrote. &quot;If they do, I think they should be taken out of that business, as
<BR>
our law enforcement officers are more than capable of identifying high-risk
<BR>
intersections.&quot; By all accounts, Lockheed Martin, the defense contractor
<BR>
hired to install and maintain the cameras, has played a huge role in
<BR>
determining
<BR>
where to put them. The corporation now stands to rake in $28 million over
<BR>
the next three years for its efforts. As insensitive as Gilmore's support of
<BR>
Confederate History Month may seem, his opposition to such surveillance
<BR>
shows that he has a deep understanding of the real threats to our liberty.
<BR>
&quot;The slippery slope we travel down when we pass laws that allow the government
<BR>
to
<BR>
record our actions is the gradual loss of our freedom as citizens to conduct
<BR>
our lives without looking over our shoulder,&quot; Gilmore said after the veto. &quot;We
<BR>
should not require our citizens to become accustomed to being watched by
<BR>
government authorities through electronic means.&quot; (Courtland Milloy column,
<BR>
Washington Post)
