<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; but try being a &quot;chick for a day&quot;, all you men.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If it ever becomes possible, I would do exactly that, in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;heartbeat. I want to figure out what it is ladies see in us ugly old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;boys. {8^D spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Really? You would try being a woman for a day?
</EM><BR>
<P>If you can find a way to let humans have accurate memories of being
<BR>
something they think they can not easily become - for instance, of being
<BR>
a woman for a man or vice versa, but *also*, say, of being a scientist
<BR>
to an average person, or of being an average user to a designer of
<BR>
products - you will find much interest just out of human curiosity.  You
<BR>
may also find that those who receive memories by this process open their
<BR>
minds as a result, for one is less likely to brush off arguments from a
<BR>
perspective that one has had.  (You may, however, want to make said
<BR>
memories recognizably unreal, such that people do not get confused as to
<BR>
when they stopped being what they never were.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What if it was a day in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a woman's life when she was pregnant?
</EM><BR>
<P>This would not be my first choice of all female experiences, but I might
<BR>
try it after trying others.  (I would rather have the memory of a woman
<BR>
on her wedding day, to better understand the significance of that.)
<BR>
<P>Of course, this all assumes that one can have the memories without
<BR>
consequences - for instance, having given birth but not, once the memory
<BR>
is done, actually having a new child just because of the memory.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I wouldn't mind being a guy for a day so I could maybe reach the top
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shelf in my cupboard for once ...
</EM><BR>
<P>That's not a guy thing.  That's a tall person thing.  And having the
<BR>
memory would only frustrate you there; perhaps some arm extenders would
<BR>
help.
