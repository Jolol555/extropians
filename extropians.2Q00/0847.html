<EM>&gt; &gt; I am curious to know what the list members think will be the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; differences between the &quot;haves and the have-nots&quot; a half-century from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;now?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Education, and the mental - as opposed to physical - ability to obtain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;new information as it becomes available and desirable, will probably be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one of the determining differences.  Quite likely, anyone who wishes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do so and knows how to will be able to log on from their home or nearest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;public access terminal to find answers to the pressing questions of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;moment, in degrees of seriousness ranging from the humor behind a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;friend's light jest regarding something one is not quite familiar with,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the user-created manual on a tool one is using, to auto-generated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(and, one would hope, accurate) lists of customers for whatever creative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effort one has been inspired to do, to various media embodiments of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;answers to &quot;how do I do that&quot;.  The main reason the have nots will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be enriching themselves this way, is that they will not know or not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think to apply that to their problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Health is likely to be another distinguishing factor.  Haves: enhanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beyond human norms, rate of death approaching zero - though probably not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually reaching it, unless one excludes death-and-revive (as, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instance, is promised by cryogenic suspension and nanotechnology) from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the death count.  Have nots: healthy by 2000s standards, but still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suffer from the common cold and such; generally not enhanced much beyond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;2000-era human norms.
</EM><BR>
<P>Consider that one half of the human population has lived mostly by virtue of 
<BR>
information technology in recent times.  I.e., women.  Most women in Western 
<BR>
society for most of the previous century could just as easilly have been 
<BR>
dispensed with by the men who were the primary &quot;bread-winners&quot; in most 
<BR>
households. It's very easy and economical to live as a single male, but most 
<BR>
women found a man who was willing to finance their lives as well as their 
<BR>
children.
<BR>
<P>For what?  Love, obviously.  That's the short answer, and the most correct 
<BR>
approximation perhaps.  The reality is more complex, but what the men got in 
<BR>
return - in the relationships that actually worked, anyway - was visibility 
<BR>
- dailly feedback keeping them centered and aware of themselves from a 
<BR>
highly experienced source.  Sex, after all, is a feedback loop, modulated by 
<BR>
the nature of the various components.  But of course sex is generally only a 
<BR>
small portion of the total interaction.
<BR>
<P>Consider how much people pay for a massage, when auto-massage machines are 
<BR>
readilly available.  The point of consciousness is feedback.  Consciouness 
<BR>
determines action in the face of alternatives, makes choices based on the 
<BR>
experience - feedback - of previous actions.  Incentive - all the forms of 
<BR>
internal rewards - are forms of feedback.  Art is a perceptual 
<BR>
concretization - feedback - of internal constructs.  We work not to eat - 
<BR>
that alone would occupy a tiny fraction of the time and effort we employ - 
<BR>
but to see ourselves through our consequences in the world - feedback.
<BR>
<P>I.e., bottom line is that we humans - or even higher mammals - have always 
<BR>
lived primarily in an information economy.
<BR>
<P>With unemployment in the recognized occupations falling to its natural 
<BR>
limits, as the information economy progresses we will likely have companies 
<BR>
(another old concept, but for lack of a better term) begging for people to 
<BR>
engage their minds in all kinds of projects.  All these web freebies 
<BR>
financed by banner ads?  That's the future.  There is going to be a &quot;labor&quot; 
<BR>
shortage of monumental proportions that will likely have an impact similar 
<BR>
to the great &quot;Black Death&quot; die-off of the late Middle Ages, which is often 
<BR>
credited with destroying the old hierarchies and leading to the Renaissance.
