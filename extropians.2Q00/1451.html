About the following study, Science News (10/2/99) states:
<BR>
&quot;Leukemia cells, prostate tumors, and breast cancers are
<BR>
among malignancies that like to stock up on copious amounts
<BR>
of ascorbate, also known as vitamin C, a new study finds.&quot;
<BR>
Perhaps tumor cells might use vitamin C to defend themselves
<BR>
against attacks from the immune system, which I understand
<BR>
generates free radicals to destroy pathogens, and probably
<BR>
cancer. Important for life-extenders to note, the study
<BR>
found that the co-administration of superoxide dismutase
<BR>
(SOD) with vitamin C prevented the uptake of vitamin C by
<BR>
tumor cells, for reasons that are indicated (keep in mind
<BR>
if you want to take SOD pills that Durk Pearson and Sandy
<BR>
Shaw state in &quot;Life Extension&quot; that &quot;one part in 10,000
<BR>
of SOD administered orally survives processing in the
<BR>
stomach and receaches the bloodstream.&quot; page 496):

<P>Human tumors may contain high concentrations of
<BR>
ascorbic acid, but little is known about how they
<BR>
acquire the vitamin. Certain specialized cells can
<BR>
transport ascorbic acid directly through a sodium
<BR>
ascorbate cotransporter, but in most cells, vitamin
<BR>
C enters through the facilitative glucose transporters
<BR>
(GLUTs) in the form of dehydroascorbic acid, which
<BR>
is then reduced intracellularly and retained as
<BR>
ascorbic acid. Mice with established hematopoietic
<BR>
and epithelial cell xenografts wereascorbic acid.
<BR>
Most hematopoietic and epithelial tumor cell lines
<BR>
can only transport vitamin C in the oxidized form
<BR>
(dehydroascorbic acid) in vitro; however, when grown
<BR>
as xenografts in mice, they rapidly accumulated
<BR>
vitamin C after administration of radiolabeled
<BR>
ascorbic acid. The involvement of the GLUTs in
<BR>
vitamin C uptake by the xenografted tumors was
<BR>
demonstrated by competitive inhibition with D-glucose
<BR>
but not L-glucose. Because the malignant cells were
<BR>
not capable of directly transporting ascorbic acid,
<BR>
we reasoned that the ascorbic acid was oxidized to
<BR>
dehydroascorbic acid in the tumor microenvironment.
<BR>
Tumor accumulation of vitamin C in animals injected
<BR>
with ascorbic acid was inhibited by coadministration
<BR>
of superoxide dismutase, implying a role for superoxide
<BR>
anion in the oxidation of ascorbic acid. Whereas the
<BR>
epithelial cancer cell lines could not generate
<BR>
superoxide anion in culture, the minced xenograft
<BR>
tumors did. Our studies show the transport of
<BR>
dehydroascorbic acid by GLUTs is a means by which
<BR>
tumors acquire vitamin C and indicate the oxidation
<BR>
of ascorbic acid by superoxide anion produced by
<BR>
cells in the tumor stroma as a mechanism for
<BR>
generating the transportable form of the vitamin.
