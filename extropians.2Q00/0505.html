<P>Thanks Damien. I would prefer, however, to see the actual statistics
<BR>
released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, rather than what some
<BR>
gun control group claims they are. From my own experience with gun
<BR>
control groups here in the US, they are superb liars and propagandists,
<BR>
and while I might be wrong about your groups down there, I don't think
<BR>
they can be that much different.
<BR>
<P>Since the ABS hasn't posted any actual stats on crime on its website, do
<BR>
you think you could access their data at your university library?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ==============
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Aside from a host of  factual errors (including a description of &quot;Mr&quot; Meg
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lees of the Australian Democrats as the leader of &quot;a small but vocal group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of hard leftists&quot;) [she leads a middle-of-the-road but by Oz standards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slightly rightish minority party] more serious misinformation in the pieces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; include the following claims, with correct data provided from Australian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bureau of  Statistics and Australian Institute of Criminology publications:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   The claims incorrectly assume that 1997 is the first year after the new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun laws became operative. In 1996-7 the laws were changed. 1998  is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first year statistics can be tested.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Claim 1. Australian homicides are up 3.2% since the new laws.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   In 1998, compared to the average of the two years prior to new gun laws
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becoming operative (1996-1997), gun homicides dropped by  37.8%. Murder by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all means dropped 13.7%.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Claim 2. Armed robberies are up by a &quot;whopping&quot; 44% since the new laws.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact the rate of armed robbery increase dropped 12% in  1998.
</EM><BR>
<P>the 'rate of armed robberies increase' dropped 12% does not contradict
<BR>
that the rate of armed robberies went up by 44%, only that this rate is
<BR>
12% lower than the increase of the previous year, so that in 1997, armed
<BR>
robberies went up by about 49%, possibly. Must pay attention to the
<BR>
terms used.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Claim 3. Assaults are up 8.6% since the new laws. In fact the rate of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assaults increase dropped by 4.2% in 1998.
</EM><BR>
<P>So the assaults were up 9% in the previous period, and increased this
<BR>
period by only 8.6%?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Claim 4. In [the state of] Victoria there was a 300% increase in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; homicides following the new laws. In fact the homicide rate in Victoria
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dropped by 19.8%  in 1998. Victoria has for many years had the lowest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; homicide rate of the six Australian states. In three months we will have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 1999 ABS  statistics. These will allow the matter to be re-examined.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd be interested to see whether the definitions changed.
