<P>
A personal account is forwarded from the Forteana list - TWC:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Proponents, including many patients, say it can offer great and lasting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;help. Critics such as Shorter say the field has been responsible for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suicides of many severely mentally ill patients who required medication and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hospitalization more than sessions on the couch.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do I ever have to second that!!! The basis of psychoanalysis is that there 
<BR>
is something wrong with the patient that the patient is capable of 
<BR>
changing, and if (s)he doesn't, it is his or her fault. It is unfortunate 
<BR>
that this very faulty viewpoint is held by most people today, and 
<BR>
medication is looked down upon as a weakness and laziness on the part of 
<BR>
the patient. It just isn't so. The thing that most troubles me after having 
<BR>
been taken on a long ride through the system, is that the psychoanalysts 
<BR>
seemed to me to be the most messed up of all of us. I won't even hazard a 
<BR>
guess as to why, but I don't have enough fingers or toes to count the times 
<BR>
I have ended up discussing my psychologists' problems with them instead of 
<BR>
discussing what they perceived as my own. I will say this also, it is 
<BR>
pathetic how each one of them follows fashion in the psychology world, 
<BR>
recommending the current best-seller and cramming their patients into holes 
<BR>
that they do not fit in. Because by being there in the first place the 
<BR>
patient is admitting to a correctable fault, (s)he is very suggestible. 
<BR>
When the course of treatment predictably fails, the patient feels even 
<BR>
worse about his or herself, and is more likely to feel suicide is the only 
<BR>
answer. I would not go so far as to say that support groups are bad, 
<BR>
although I think they could be much helped if they were not lead by a 
<BR>
psychologist whose presence and comments are likely to put an additional 
<BR>
load on the patient in the form of guilt. I am glad to see the tide 
<BR>
changing, even if it is ever so slightly. HMOs are recognizing that 
<BR>
treatment by psychiatrists with medication being the primary mode of 
<BR>
treatment is valid and no longer requires going through a psychologist 
<BR>
referral first. Freud set us back a long long way and the only comfort we 
<BR>
can take from his existence is that he is the root of a lot of good jokes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Some of those findings are disturbing, particularly the idea that our inner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;selves can be boiled down to a chemical recipe that can be tweaked and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;improved with pinches of lithium salts and dashes of serotonin blockers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Today's reductionist, biological, Prozac-laden approach to the mind offers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;limited understanding, Hansell said.
</EM><BR>
<P>And who the hell cares if it helps those of us who used to live day to day 
<BR>
planning the ends to our lives? What is wrong with the solution being as 
<BR>
simplistic as chemical? Is there not enough money to be made manipulating 
<BR>
people? Is it more worthy to be a complicatist instead of a reductionist?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Nevertheless, even Freud's broad cultural reach may be shrinking. In World
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;War II-era films such as Hitchcock's &quot;Spellbound,&quot; psychoanalysts were often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;portrayed as imposing, scholarly figures. Since then, portrayals of analysts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in film and television have become more comic, and sometimes mocking.
</EM><BR>
<P>As well they could be. And I suspect that is so because a closer look has 
<BR>
been taken at the people who are attempting to &quot;mold&quot; our psyches. One 
<BR>
psychologist I had was a marriage counselor. A scandal broke when it was 
<BR>
found out he was beating his wife. Another psychologist I had for 
<BR>
supposedly being addictive (to what I never found out....I neither drank, 
<BR>
did drugs or anything) was a once recovered, then lapsed alcoholic. One I 
<BR>
saw for my weight blamed it all on my mother. She had me half convinced 
<BR>
until she started using our sessions to rant about how much she hated her 
<BR>
mom so much all she wanted to do was eat to make herself feel good and then 
<BR>
she lost her husband because of it, blah, blah, blah. Another was a 
<BR>
relations counselor......he was my neighbor for awhile. Then he found a 
<BR>
woman half his age, divorced his wife and turned his back 100% on his own 
<BR>
kids. I know this because his ex-wife was my mother's best friend. Another 
<BR>
one I suffered through blamed my problems on not knowing how to parent. 
<BR>
Found out his wife and he were in counseling because they could not have 
<BR>
kids and it was creating problems. The psychologist I was at first required 
<BR>
to see by my HMO in order to see my (out of plan) psychiatrist used to fall 
<BR>
asleep during every visit. He never heard one word of what I didn't say. I 
<BR>
just sat there and waited for his little alarm to buzz that the appointment 
<BR>
was over. There were two others...one was a very (too) close personal 
<BR>
friend, and one that we had Zachary see before we decided to put him on 
<BR>
medication for his ADD. I cannot comment on my friend except to say that he 
<BR>
was the worst one of the bunch, and I have to give credit to Zachary's for 
<BR>
finally admitting to us that medication, not psychology was the only thing 
<BR>
that was going to work. It did. I cannot believe my experiences were 
<BR>
isolated and that I just happened to get the most useless psychologists 
<BR>
around. The whole field now disgusts me. That includes the animal 
<BR>
psychologists most of all.
