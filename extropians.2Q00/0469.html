<P><EM>&gt;[A]s a matter of simple textual construction and logic, I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't think you can look to the IXth amendment as a SOURCE of rights.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think the most we can say is 1) that it's not inconsistent with rights that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arise from or have their legal authority in some other source and 2) that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from this we can safely imply that the Founders believed that there were 
</EM><BR>
such 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;other sources of human rights.
</EM><BR>
<P>That strikes me as utterly sound.  The 9th does not create rights but merely 
<BR>
limits in certain ways the power of statists (federal ones at first and now, 
<BR>
thanks to incorporation via the 14th Amendment, state, too).  Or, to put it 
<BR>
another way, the 9th embodies the Founders' view that state power operates as 
<BR>
an exception to the default rule of individual liberty, an island in a sea of 
<BR>
freedom.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;[T]he Founders shared an almost 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;universal belief in &quot;natural rights&quot;.  Their thinking about the source of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;natural rights was somewhat diverse, though; some finding the basis for them 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in religious ideas, others in a kind of fictitious anthropology derived from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Locke. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd add common law to that list, as many Founders saw common law rules as 
<BR>
protective (but not exhaustive) of natural rights.  My own, somewhat 
<BR>
positivist view of natural rights looks to common law--particularly as it 
<BR>
operated in the era of competing courts--as a pretty good mechanism for 
<BR>
finding those rights that are &quot;naturally&quot; conducive to prosperity and peace.  
<BR>
But to tell that tale would take us too far from the question at hand: how to 
<BR>
understand the 9th.
