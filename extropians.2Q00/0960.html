<P><EM>&gt; I had asked:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;Where oh where did  the other folks go?&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ah! The most fervently ignored area of interest under Extropian concerns or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TransHuman concerns.  Most peeps here on the list seem to be convinced that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they will live for 10,000 years; if not forever.  To me its the analog of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trapeze acrobat working without a net; courageous but an extra hazard! So 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when will those who are qualified, academically, to publish papers come up 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with some plausible solutions for this 'situation'?  Or are we leaving it up 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to Herr God?  
</EM><BR>
<P>I like working without a net (in Russia), it keeps you sharp.  Its
<BR>
like the mental cringe our rocket engineers do every time they
<BR>
push the lauch button on those big inverted roman candles.
<BR>
<P>Speaking from experience, the costs of not getting your timing
<BR>
right can be quite expensive.  Actually there seems to be quite
<BR>
a lot of list related activity for people working in their various
<BR>
ways at moving things forward.  Robin, Anders, Eliezer and a host of
<BR>
others are publishing papers on the directions in which we are going
<BR>
and proposing various means for speeding things up.  Many of us who
<BR>
aren't &quot;doing&quot;, are thinking about how and when &quot;to do&quot;.  When we do
<BR>
do, you won't see us &quot;doing&quot;, because like Sasha or Eugene we will be
<BR>
too busy to talk about it.
<BR>
<P>I think what you see is a selection effect.
<BR>
<P>It is worth noting that when you grasp the big picture, the efforts
<BR>
of single individuals are *almost* meaningless.  The trick is to discover
<BR>
the leverage points where a single individual may exert a small force
<BR>
and cause a large mass to move(*).  Then in the future, we will look back
<BR>
at those points and say &quot;I stood there&quot;, realizing that that advanced
<BR>
the pace of discovery by maybe a week, or a month, or if you are
<BR>
very very lucky a couple of years.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>(*) Buckminster Fuller, I believe, used  supertanker rudder &quot;trim-tabs&quot; as
<BR>
the analogy for this.  Trim-tabs are at the end of a rudder and turn in
<BR>
a direction opposite to the motion of the rudder itself allowing water
<BR>
to flow around the rudder, thereby allowing the rudder to be turned
<BR>
more quickly with less force.
