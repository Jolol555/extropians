<P>&lt;&lt; Kaczynski certainly seems to want an end to all but the most primitive
<BR>
&nbsp;technologies.  I didn't get the impression from Joy's paper that he's
<BR>
&nbsp;anywhere nearly so radical. I would think that an end to progress would be
<BR>
&nbsp;easier to acheive without widespread violence than destroying existing
<BR>
&nbsp;technology. If you outlaw certain kinds of research, you only have to exert
<BR>
&nbsp;violence or the threat of violence against the small part of the population
<BR>
&nbsp;that would have been engaged in the research. The outlawing of gold as money
<BR>
&nbsp;involved force or threat of force against an entire population.

I take Joy's 'declaration' as a kind of social conscience positioning 
<BR>
statement to get into the news and to display that the cold cruel corporate 
<BR>
world of Oracle really cares. One thing those of the list neglect is that we 
<BR>
are currently nowhere near the singularity so hopefully anticipated by the 
<BR>
worthies on are Extropian. Its insubstantial in the sense that its certainly 
<BR>
not immediate, its more in the regime of what might the International Space 
<BR>
Society do to promote a Mars colony, or how might we best adapt to a changing 
<BR>
climate at the end of the 21st century--important, but not instant. If I 
<BR>
recall, the Japanesehad the musket in the 16th century and gave it up because 
<BR>
it effected the social order used by peasent or member of the daimyo 
<BR>
(Japanese house of Lords).  Technology will be used till it blows up in our 
<BR>
faces and then we'll restrict. Seems like history in action to me.
