<P>
I do not have the time to go researching nearly all of the URLs you have
<BR>
provided. After browsing two, I have questions.
<BR>
In a nutshell, can you please explain why anyone would want a virtual
<BR>
kingdom, or city or whatever. What are the benefits. Is it just a cool
<BR>
sounding idea or are there any practical applications?
<BR>
QueeneMUSE
<BR>
<P>Well, I'll try.
<BR>
<P>1. Money. They sell *a lot* of stamps, coins, etc. (i.e. the Rep. of Lomar
<BR>
selling is a very big figure)
<BR>
<P>2. Money. Some real micronation (and some not so micro, as Luxenbourg or San
<BR>
Marino or Monaco or ...) is taxation free. Virtual states are making *very
<BR>
strong* attempts in that direction ...
<BR>
<P>3. Money &amp; power. Extraterritoriality (even meta-territoriality, for those
<BR>
vitual states) means that You can give free information. Or that information
<BR>
You like to give ... (net, radio, tv, etc.)
<BR>
<P>4. Politics. See above. And entropic localism (coarse grained structures,
<BR>
fine grained structures ...).
<BR>
<P>5. Heraldry. Like to be a king ?
<BR>
<P>6. History. Take the (Principato di) Seborga case (Italy). The birth of this
<BR>
(quasi-real) state is based on many and many historical reasons.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
7. Chance. Take the Ferdinandea case. Ferdinandea is that (italian) island
<BR>
which is sometimes above the sea, sometimes below. The international law
<BR>
says that a (real) state must be *permanently* 9 meters above the sea. So
<BR>
Ferdinandea is a virtual state. But U.K. (as far as I know) claims the
<BR>
property of that *intermittent* island. Why? Strong strategic reasons ...
<BR>
