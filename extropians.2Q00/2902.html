<P><EM>&gt;         Here are some of my thoughts about what such a system would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;start out being.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         There would be a &quot;membership&quot; link off of the main
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.extropy.org/">http://www.extropy.org/</A> page.  People could go to this page and after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;logging in, check their membership status and update their personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information.  This would include information like interrests, areas of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expertise, extropian activities completed....  Everyone could specify
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the level of privacy for all data fields in their own DB file with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;following proposed values:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;[...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There would be a search page that would enable people like Sasha to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;find other extropians based on interrests, location, time....
</EM><BR>
<P>Brent: I'm very much in favor of this idea. If ExI had had the money, we 
<BR>
would have hired someone to do something like this quite a while ago. It 
<BR>
could be a great addition to the value of the website and help build the 
<BR>
extropian community.
<BR>
<P>If we can gather the programming skills necessary and get commitments to 
<BR>
get the job done (and be sure that someone will maintain it), I would be 
<BR>
delighted. A members' interests/contacts page would not only be useful, it 
<BR>
would be -- as you note -- a tribute to Sasha by following up on one of his 
<BR>
ideas.
