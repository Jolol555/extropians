<EM>&gt;This seems to be a common theme amongst recent messages (re:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;altamira's introduction message for example).  I wonder if it's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;common lifestyle throughout this community?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I mentioned it after Bonnie made a post about her lifestyle and
<BR>
suggested that others here might not feel the same. I love the
<BR>
changes I've made, and would encourage everyone to try it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Recently I've been watching the behavior of a relative of mine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who's been going through a marital separation which is putting a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bit of financial pressure on her.  She's a typical suburban
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;American with stereotypical motivations far as I can see; she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;comes home from work and plops down in front of the TV for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evening, has the usual credit card debt, car loan, etc.  She's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;never not been in debt, yet she's not in real trouble, she can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manage what she has.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From one conversation to the next her position on financial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matters changes. She'll be worried about money one day, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;next she'll be mentally shopping for new cars - this despite the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aforementioned financial pressure.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
This is the same kind of general dissatisfaction I was feeling. 10
<BR>
months ago yesterday I eliminated the biggest drain on my wallet
<BR>
and my health, I quit drinking alcohol. I was a typical binge
<BR>
drinker, I rarely drank during the week, but lookout Friday night!
<BR>
<P>With this change in lifestyle (it was a BIG change) I started
<BR>
looking around. I had previously read David Chaitan's &quot;The Wealthy
<BR>
Barber&quot;, now I stumbled onto &quot;The Millionare Next Door&quot; and some
<BR>
other books and began the metamorphosis.
<BR>
<P>I have what I thought was quite a bit in my portfolio,
<BR>
(considerably more than most of my peers) but found I was at half
<BR>
of what I should be to be &quot;balance sheet affluent&quot;.( age/10 X
<BR>
yearly income= net worth) In addition I was still maintaining some
<BR>
$7000 in consumer debt.
<BR>
<P>I am now socking it away to the tune of $1000+ a month. In less
<BR>
than 7 months I will be completely debt free. I could do it faster,
<BR>
but am building up my reserves (money market account) at the same
<BR>
time. Next stop, additional investments, possibly a house. I credit
<BR>
the good folks at The Motley Fool for many of these ideas. Max has
<BR>
already mentioned the &quot;Living Below Your Means&quot; discussion board
<BR>
there. I post as Brian239.
<BR>
<P>As Max pointed out when Extropy institute started the Investing
<BR>
node, if we're (Extropians) so smart, why aren't we rich? I intend
<BR>
to be both.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;For myself, I've almost always lived below my means - not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;necessarily simply (I live in Manhattan and have the usual toys in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my apartment, though the stereo is 11 yrs old - my vice is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expensive bicycles..) and not necessarily by a conscious choice to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do so - I just don't feel motivated to acquire the costly baggage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most people have, so my expenses are low relative to many people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around me.  (you know, those Wall Street yuppies!).  I don't value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;big houses or fancy cars - at least, not at the levels that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;general population appears to.  In fact, I find that posessions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;almost make me nervous - it's _stuff_ that I have to take care of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- if I want to travel, or take a job in another city, or whatever,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have to move this _stuff_ around or make it go away somehow.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The more I think about it, the more I value freedom - physical,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get-up-and-go freedom, and positive numbers in my accounts.  And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&lt;I can always buy stuff with those positive numbers, if I want.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>It sounds like your doing great! There's nothing wrong with owning
<BR>
nice things, but you should not buy them on credit. If I remember
<BR>
correctly the rule on houses is not to assume a mortgage more than
<BR>
twice your income. The trick being to buy a starter home first, and
<BR>
build equity.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I wonder if extropians have resistance to consumerist memes, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only because we pay attention to information sources other than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consumerist media?
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't have much resistance previously, but I'm up for increasing
<BR>
our immunity.  ;)
