<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not so. Foreign companies cannot have anti-trust actions brought against

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; them, only US based companies can be charged with such 'crimes'.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not quite.  The reason I posted the link to the statute was so you could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read it for yourself.  If you had you would have known that there is nothing

<EM>&gt; in the act which limits it to companies &quot;based&quot; in the US.  I'll try again:

<EM>&gt; The short answer is, as long as a company's actions restrain &quot;trade or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commerce in any Territory of the United States&quot; (regardless of where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; company is based, they will be subject to the act.

Literally by your intepretation, yes, however the US has never brought
<BR>
an anti-trust suit against a foreign company. Considering the weight of
<BR>
corporate systems like the keiretsu, etc. as monopolistic enterprises, I
<BR>
fail to see how the Justice department could tolerate a foreign national
<BR>
government monopoly bringing anti-trust action against a US corp
<BR>
(especially in light of how nice we have been to the French with their
<BR>
desire to retain monopoly on the words 'Champagne' and 'Burgundy' for
<BR>
their particular trade items that have been quite well duplicated
<BR>
elsewhere.)
<BR>
<P>If the French were so keen on developing a 'viable' competition, why did
<BR>
they not develop a Frogosoft corporation to compete with MS, as they did
<BR>
to form Airbus to compete with Boeing (interesting Seattle parallel)?
