<P><EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;Goodness, Natasha, it was a joke, quite obviously so, going by

<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;the reactions of others. The point was: under the assumption
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;that these emails have no basis in fact, there has to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;something highly irrational going on.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; Why on Earth would I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; the particular person you happened to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; involved with pre-Max?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I wouldn't expect you to know;  that is why your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; asumption was so strange and irrelevant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not an assumption -- that was corrected earlier, yes?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it was not corrected.  Your trying to use me as a side kick was mean
<BR>
spirited.  I don't take jabs like this lightly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; Before pulling out the barf bag, check alternate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt; assumptions -- may I suggest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; And what might that be?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Already mentioned one (a jesting attempt to show just how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extreme one would have to reach to make sense of this guy's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;motivations); Max can probably explain the other more easily:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ask him about the old &quot;Hesperus&quot; and &quot;Phosphorus&quot; question --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you suffered a reference trauma (for which I think I'm slightly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;responsible, but not mostly).
</EM><BR>
<P>Your so called jest was not stated in a fun way, Brain.  I don't know who
<BR>
this guy or gal was.  But making a remark that it was a past romance of
<BR>
mine was quite rude.  The above paragraph is another of your snide remarks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm not absolutely certain it is, though I feel fairly confident
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is. The same tactic was used in both cases: an attempt to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me on his side by constant reference to Max's having &quot;stolen&quot; my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;ultrahumanism&quot; term
</EM><BR>
<P>I now don't think it was your term at all.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Towards the Good,
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't believe this.
