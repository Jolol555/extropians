<EM>&gt; I don't ever watch TV except sometimes I tune in Mexico DF stations to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improve my use of the Spanish language (we have a satellite dish); don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listen to the radio much.  So I'm not exposed to much advertising. I do find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that when I go into town and see all the displays in the stores I get urges
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to buy all sorts of stuff that I don't really need.  What helps me resist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is that my house is very small, and I remind myself that whatever I buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is one more thing I have to make room for.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>TV and other mass media were the first things to go for me.  They offer
<BR>
very little of value and cost a lot (not in a direct monetary way either).
<BR>
They definitely encourage unnecessary consumption.  My money goes towards
<BR>
things that actually matter to me.
<BR>
<P>I only have two expensive lifestyle habits right now:  music gear and fine
<BR>
dining, but I've used a number of techniques to reduce these expenditures
<BR>
to a bare minimum.  Because I am a gear whore, I have a
<BR>
relatively large collection of synthesizers (my primary consumer vice) and
<BR>
related music gear.  My solution has been to fix the total pieces of
<BR>
equipment to the number I have now; if I want to buy something, I have to
<BR>
sell something else.  It is still usually a net expenditure, but it forces
<BR>
me to seriously consider the benefits of buying something.
<BR>
<P>Fine dining at expensive restaurants is something that I have minimized by
<BR>
eliminating all the mediocre experiences (I generally eat at home anyway). 
<BR>
In other words, rather than going to a &quot;very good&quot; restaurant every two
<BR>
weeks, I've reduced it to going to only the best restaurants, but only
<BR>
once every month or two.  I rarely go to restaurant twice (I am looking
<BR>
for a unique experience each time), so this also allows me to be more
<BR>
selective in a given metropolitan area.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's something that's surprised me:  My annual income dropped from 6
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figures to 4 when I changed my lifestyle.  And yet I'm still able to spend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the same amount of money on fun things now as I was then.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expensive house and car, the fancy clothes, the dinners in expensive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; restaurants, the nights in high-dollar hotels all had to go.  But these were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not things that gave me any real pleasure.  For me the really fun things are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; books, music, plants for my garden, computer toys, and these I can still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have, along with much more time to enjoy them.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>If I optimized my life for maximal pleasure, I am quite certain that I
<BR>
could live on an order of magnitude less money than I currently earn.  The
<BR>
downside is that doing so would create an unnecessary resource limitation.
<BR>
In fact, what you are describing is a resource stasis of sorts.  My
<BR>
interest in money is only to the extent that I can fund cool projects that
<BR>
interest me in the future.  I view simple living largely as a way to
<BR>
promote wealth and well-being -- a means rather than an end.  My
<BR>
curiousity and ambition would never be satisfied unless I was involved in
<BR>
some type of hill-climbing behavior.  I just pick my hills more carefully.
