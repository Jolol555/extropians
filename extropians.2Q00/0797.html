<EM>&gt; &gt; But I've come to a different conclusion now.  The truth is that space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; didn't pay and with 20th century technology it never could.  I've yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to see a good economic justification for the kind of truly massive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; public spending required to do anything outside of LEO with that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; kind of technology and, believe me, I WANT to see such a thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Greg, it has &quot;relatively&quot; little to do with the technology and a lot
<BR>
to do with the volumes.  I think there is a chapter in the Starflight
<BR>
Handbook that deals with the fact that you have to have a *lot* of
<BR>
people who want to go into space to make it work.  The legacy that
<BR>
Iridium may leave behind is the fact that is created a volume launch
<BR>
requirement that may have permanently lowered the cost of getting
<BR>
things into space.  Rockets don't have to be terribly more expensive
<BR>
than airplanes, they have to fly with airplane frequency however to
<BR>
distribute the development and infrastructure costs over enough
<BR>
seat miles to make such trips affordable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; LEO is a start.  (Actually GEO appears to be where a lot of money is for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commercial satelites.) I think if the government space programs were shut
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down and private launch companies used exclusively, we'd see a lot of action
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in LEO leading to action higher up.  My guess would also be that this would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; build a true infrastructure for space colonization, rather than the rickety
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one NASA has built, abandoned, and rebuilt.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have my doubts.  Tourism is the only application I could see that
<BR>
would demand volumes that would bring ticket prices down $100K-1K range.
<BR>
After you have your weather satellites, your multi-spectral imaging
<BR>
satellites, your TV satellites and some comm satellites (rapidly being
<BR>
displaced by fiber), *what* good is space?  It doesn't have any resources
<BR>
that humans, as currently engineered, really need that can not be obtained
<BR>
for much less on the ground.
<BR>
<P>Now if you want to get creative, go for tele-operated no-holds barred
<BR>
robo-wars on the moon.  Get Sony to adapt that little doggie into a
<BR>
robo-space-pit-bull and you would have dozens of teenagers saving
<BR>
their pennies just to buy one and enter the games.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Though I agree GNR will help make CAtS better, if we just took that old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Saturn V design, which, if I'm right, is now unpatented, we could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; making disposable launch vehicles that could put huge cargoes in orbit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; NOW!
</EM><BR>
<P>There are plenty of other boosters that are reliable and have more efficient
<BR>
designs that exist now if all you want is to put &quot;cargo&quot; into orbit.  What
<BR>
I think you mean is that you want to put large systems in space for efforts
<BR>
oriented towards colonization and that fails the &quot;humans are not designed
<BR>
for space&quot; test.  If you want a rationale for going into space, you
<BR>
need creatures that have an ecology *adapted* for space and use the
<BR>
resources, esp. energy and minerals it provides.  GNR doesn't immediately
<BR>
result in CAtS.  You still have to design the machines to do it.  If
<BR>
you get to the point where AI can do MNT design, then it will be AI
<BR>
combined with MNT that will allow CAtS.  What MNT does allow is the
<BR>
eventual construction of an entirely space based ecology.  That will
<BR>
not make it an environment for us however.  Sure, we can adapt it
<BR>
to our needs, but conversely with that technology we can adapt
<BR>
ourselves to that environment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I DISAGREE!  The problem is not reusable vs. non-reusable.  The fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people think in those terms only shows how much this locks up the space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mindset.  Reusable rockets, like the Shuttle, have actually increased launch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; costs, according to David P. Gump in his _Space Enterprise: Beyond NASA_.
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends how you do the accounting.  Reusable only decreases costs
<BR>
if the machines are reused as airplanes are, i.e. at high frequency.
<BR>
If the complexity or safety requirements prevent rapid turnaround
<BR>
times, then reusable is more expensive.
<BR>
<P>If you take the 1975 quoted cost of Apollo ($39 billion) and divide
<BR>
it by some ~18(?) launches, that works out to something like $2 billion
<BR>
per launch.  That is still a lot more than $400 million (in Y2K $)
<BR>
that a shuttle launch costs where you are putting up ~2x as many people.
<BR>
(Of course the shuttle can't get you to the moon, so there is some
<BR>
balancing that needs to be done.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Daniel, if you're going to ask Earth to support an extraterrestrial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; economy, I think you have to come up with an economic rationale.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm waiting . . .
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not thinking that way, but I thought I answered this elsewhere.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I recall, Daniel, those arguments seemed *thin* to me.  For example,
<BR>
you argue for space power with no comparative analysis of what a similar
<BR>
investment in agricultural and/or electrical or transporation industries
<BR>
would produce in terms of greater efficiencies that would eliminate
<BR>
the need for greater power resources.  As I've argued in other letters,
<BR>
we are a *very* long way from the theoretical efficiency limits of
<BR>
our current ecology.  [For example, even a few $10's of millions put
<BR>
into reversible logic designs would result in PC's in 10 years that
<BR>
consumed much less power than those currently becoming ubiquitous
<BR>
and consuming an ever increasing percentage of electricity produced.]
