<P>High-tech guru offers a chip for your thoughts
<BR>
<P>Published in the Asbury Park Press 5/15/00

Second of three parts

GANNETT NEWS SERVICE
<BR>
<P>Privacy advocates fear that as rapid advances are made in technology, the
<BR>
personal lives of Americans may be shadowed by a cloud no bigger than a
<BR>
computer chip.
<BR>
<P>Gannett Photo Network
<BR>
<P>MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor proposes uploading information direct
<BR>
to people's brains via computer chip.
<BR>
One proposal, drawn from a recent science fiction film, is close to reality.
<BR>
<P>Michael Saylor the 35-year-old founder of MicroStrategy, who perhaps is most
<BR>
famous for watching his personal net stock worth drop $6 billion in a single
<BR>
morning without whimpering is involved with the concept.
<BR>
<P>Saylor wants to beam information directly into your mind; he calls it
<BR>
&quot;telepathic intelligence.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Saylor would do it by having a tiny transmitter surgically implanted in your
<BR>
skull or by sewing a computer chip into your wrist and having it transmit to
<BR>
an embedded radiolike device near your ear bones.
<BR>
<P>His computers already process a mammoth amount of data; pertinent portions
<BR>
would be tailored to your life and interests, then transmitted to brain or
<BR>
ear instantaneously 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
<BR>
<P>Your stock is tanking sell. You're on the wrong street turn here. Your
<BR>
spouse wrecked the other car call the insurance company. Your house is being
<BR>
burglarized call the cops. The doctor called in your prescription visit the
<BR>
pharmacy.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I don't know who in their right mind would let somebody implant this in
<BR>
their head,&quot; says Fordham University Law School professor Joel Reidenberg,
<BR>
an expert on information privacy. &quot;To the extent that we begin to create a
<BR>
system of automatons responding to chip implants in people's brains, we will
<BR>
be destroying the foundations of a democratic society.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Without question, there would be a great opportunity for mischief here.&quot;
<BR>
<P>MicroStrategy spokesmen confirm that Saylor &quot;sees potential in the future of
<BR>
such a chip&quot; and that the firm's Strategy.com subsidiary a network of
<BR>
&quot;customer intelligence channels&quot; that sends 300,000 people some 2 million
<BR>
personalized messages a week is working long term on the idea.
<BR>
<P>But MicroStrategy spokesman Michael Quint said this would be what computer
<BR>
business calls &quot;opt-in&quot;: &quot;&quot;It's all permission marketing. If you're talking
<BR>
about the privacy thing, we'd need to get the permission of the customer or
<BR>
the consumer.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Reidenberg is not impressed: &quot;The notion that it's &quot;permission marketing
<BR>
only' is a hoax. There's no way a citizen in our society can make an
<BR>
intelligent, informed decision about the risks of these implants, which
<BR>
would be sold through very sophisticated marketing by organizations with
<BR>
large economic interests whose goals are not to promote the public interest.
<BR>
That's a very scary vision for a democratic society.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Forget the health and safety issues. Assume they figure out how not to kill
<BR>
people when they put it in. The information-control aspects are beyond what
<BR>
George Orwell could have dreamed about.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Not everyone is upset by this techno-vision.
<BR>
<P>When online prankster Bill Cross a few months ago put up a hoax Web site
<BR>
that offered $250 for letting surgeons insert an electronic chip under the
<BR>
right palm for cashless purchases, he was stunned at the response. People
<BR>
signed up for the nonexistent implant &quot;in droves,&quot; he says.
<BR>
<P>And the techno-vision is reality.
<BR>
<P>Three months ago Applied Digital Solutions a publicly traded firm based in
<BR>
Palm Beach announced it had developed a high-tech transceiver chip, thinner
<BR>
than a dime, that could be implanted in flesh and used as a tracking device
<BR>
by transmitting the person's whereabouts to a global positioning satellite.
<BR>
<P>Trademarked as the &quot;Digital Angel,&quot; the chip could be inserted in children
<BR>
at the behest of parents who fear kidnappers or in elderly parents at the
<BR>
behest of children who fear those afflicted with Alzheimer's will wander
<BR>
off. The chip can hold medical and financial information.
<BR>
<P>Applied Digital says the implant would be voluntary, making the privacy
<BR>
issue moot.
<BR>
<P>But David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information
<BR>
Center in Washington, D.C., worries the device could evolve into a workplace
<BR>
requirement one that &quot;would dwarf polygraphs and drug testing.&quot;
<BR>
<P>And more than 500,000 pets now carry between their shoulder blades an
<BR>
implanted, scannable computer chip carrying owner and vaccination data.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The technology is there to implant chips allowing programming of devices,
<BR>
like in your pacemaker,&quot; says Washington privacy consultant Robert Gellman,
<BR>
who calls Saylor's idea &quot;Big Brother on steroids.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Says Gellman: &quot;I keep thinking one day soon they'll be able to beam
<BR>
commercials into your pacemaker that warn, &quot;Buy our product, or we're going
<BR>
to skip a couple of heartbeats.' Think of all the people who believe the CIA
<BR>
is beaming rays into their heads already.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Saylor bothers privacy advocates in another way.
<BR>
<P>He wants the government to make the huge Medicare database available online
<BR>
so it easily could be compiled and searched by his firm to discover
<BR>
dangerous medications and unsafe physicians, about whom you would be warned.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Give me your medical records, and I will give you more life,&quot; Saylor says.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Privacy advocates should take him seriously,&quot; said Evan Hendricks,
<BR>
publisher of the watchdog Privacy Times. &quot;He's putting out his own version
<BR>
of &quot;Mein Kampf.' Saylor is very genuine, I think. The more data they have,
<BR>
the more strategic decisions they can make.&quot;
