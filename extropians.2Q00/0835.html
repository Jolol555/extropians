<EM>&gt; &gt; The point of difficulty is with whether place names
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like Champagne or Vermont are more well known as product types, or as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; geographic regions. If the more common definition is as a product type,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; then any geographic restrictions should not really hold.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For products that are primarily agricultural (wine and maple syrup are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good examples) geography _is_ part of the product quality, because no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two regions of Earth have the same soil, weather, and other conditions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that affect agricultural products.  I can plant Vidalia onions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in my backyard, and even try to reduce the sulfur content of my soil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to that of Vidalia, but it will never quite be Vidalia soil, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; onions just won't be real Vidalia onions.  Ditto Vermont maple syrup,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tequila, Bordeaux, and other products.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yet a New York company that makes fake maple syrup out of corn syrup and
<BR>
maple extract is allowed to call its product Vermont Maid Maple Syrup.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course the trademark laws go a little further than that in also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protecting localized products whose quality isn't based on local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soil: Kentucky Sour Mash Bourbon, for example, is usually made from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of state grain, but Tennesee distillers who use the same grain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the same process (like Jack Daniels) can't legally call their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; product Kentucky Sour Mash if they didn't actually make it there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (For the Bourbon drinkers out there I am _not_ arguing that Jack
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Daniels is of similar quality to a good Kentucky Sour Mash, or even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a mediocre one like Wild Turkey, just that it has no legitimate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason not to claim the title).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yet there are other agricultural products, like livestock which have
<BR>
geographic names but are not raised there (Hampshire chickens, Cornish
<BR>
hens, etc) and products like beer (Old Milwaukee, produced for the New
<BR>
England market at a plant in Manchester NH and made from the water of
<BR>
the Merrimack River...) and cheese (Cheddar, Roquefort, etc...) that are
<BR>
also named despite their being produced outside the geographies they
<BR>
originated in, and their taste is quite dependent upon the local
<BR>
product. Milk from cows raised in Vermont is going to make cheddar that
<BR>
tastes different from Wisconsin Cheddar, or Cheddar Cheddar, etc.
