Mike Lorrey is said to have said:
<BR>
<P>&quot;...........................whereupon I stood up
<BR>
and told them they were wrong and proceeded to explain what really
<BR>
caused the seasons. I got told to shut up and I was sent to the
<BR>
principals office... and people wonder why I don't have much respect for
<BR>
teachers in america...&quot;
<BR>
<P>You too?
<BR>
<P>I got sent home from school.......fifth grade i think......cause I
<BR>
stubbornly insisted that Pluto WASN'T the 9th planet....THEN (about
<BR>
1956....pluto has a very eccentric orbit...it was the 8th planet from the
<BR>
sun at that time....probably still is come to think of it)....
<BR>
<P>Ditto the loss of credibility for teachers...
