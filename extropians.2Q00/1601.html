From: Charlie Stross &lt;<A HREF="mailto:charlie@antipope.org?Subject=Re:%20Northern%20Ireland%20(was%20Re:%20Nanotech%20Restrictions)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200004261347.GAA12332@well.com&gt;">charlie@antipope.org</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Clue #1: it isn't the English in northern Ireland; it's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;British Army. You're about four hundred years too late to fix
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Oliver Cromwell's big mistake, and now we've got to live with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consequences.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know this, I assume when you talk about living with the
<BR>
consequences you're talking about continued British rule there.
<BR>
That is the problem.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Clue #2: have you by any chance heard of a nice, friendly bunch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lads called the UVF? If the British government withdrew from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Northern Ireland tomorrow they'd be only too happy to take over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the policing job. In fact, you'd have a hard job keeping them from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;protecting the community by their preferred techniques -- the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bomb, the gun, and the baseball bat.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(There used to be two communities in the Republic, only they had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a little civil war in the 1920's. You might have read about it at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;school in history classes, if you'd been paying attention. Now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there's only _one_community down south -- and their opposite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;number up north have long memories and hold grudges. It's not just
</EM><BR>
the pIRA who plant bombs ...)
<BR>
<P><P>The real power in Northern Ireland are the British troops. 
<BR>
<P>I've been in Irish Pubs since I could walk, and I put three lads on
<BR>
a plane to Belfast last night, I don't need history lessons from
<BR>
you.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Clue #3: there are two native communities in Northern Ireland.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They love each other so much that the mere threat of a British
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;withdrawl is enough to give the government of Eire a panic attack;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the aftermath of a British withdrawl without some sort of peace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;settlement would resemble Bosnia.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now, would you like to explain exactly how your suggestion would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;result in a successful resolution of the Irish problem? If you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;convince us, then I suggest you will not find the Prime Minister
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and the Taioseach uninterested. (They -- and their predecessors --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have been looking for a solution for the past three decades, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;great personal risk.) If you can't suggest a solution, may I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;submit that the smart thing to do would be in future to do your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;research _before_ you open your mouth in public?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't consider the decendants of a forced resettlement to be
<BR>
native. Although I agree that anyone born in Ireland is Irish by
<BR>
defination. The issue has never been strictly Catholic/Protestant,
<BR>
it's about British rule.
<BR>
<P><P><P>The first step to a solution is to remove the British troops, if
<BR>
peacekeeping troops are required for a while they should be U.N.
<BR>
peacekeepers.
<BR>
<P>No British troops, no more walks through Catholic neighborhoods.
<BR>
<P>The British aren't interested in peace, they're interested in a
<BR>
solution that leaves them with a military victory.
<BR>
<P>And I will open my mouth any time I please, We have a saying here
<BR>
in Chicago, &quot;Don't let your mouth write a check your ass can't
<BR>
cash.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I don't take advice from British apologists.
