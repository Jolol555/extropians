</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  There seems to be evidence of orthogenetic (not a typo; I do
<BR>
NOT mean ontogenetic here) processes in evolution.  E.g., back and forth
<BR>
mutation rates are usually not equal.  (Drisophilia antennae mutate into
<BR>
legs usually.  Very rarely do we see the reverse.)  There are other
<BR>
examples.
<BR>
<P>It might be better to say that evolution appears to be &quot;blind&quot; in terms of
<BR>
fitting the environment.  The internal (to the genomic system or organism or
<BR>
species) mechanisms producing diversity do not appear to &quot;know&quot; about the
<BR>
environment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Intelligent entities are capable of creating systems based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; earlier experience and make deliberate jumps in form space that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be unlikely with undirected evolution.
</EM><BR>
<P>The use of &quot;undirected&quot; here can be misleading.  I would say a lot of
<BR>
evolutionary processes are directed, but not in the sense of there being a
<BR>
conscious goal.  Instead, what I mean is that the initial conditions of
<BR>
biological evolution (for each of us, our initial condition is our genetics
<BR>
and cytoplasm at birth; for a population of organisms, the initial
<BR>
conditions are its genome, which is typically nonrandom) constrain in which
<BR>
directions variation will take place.  This sets the ground on which
<BR>
environmental fitness (boundary conditions) can act.
<BR>
<P>If such were not the case, I believe, evolution would be cyclical instead of
<BR>
what we see which is complexity-increasing.  (I almost typed &quot;progressive&quot;
<BR>
there.:)  Dollo's Law, you know?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; While I would say deliberate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modifications and creation is part of the general phenomenon of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolution it is very unlike natural evolution.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would question the use of &quot;natural&quot; here, but that would be a semantic
<BR>
quibble.  I get what Anders means.  I think in a lot of areas, we could
<BR>
benefit from using things like evolutionary computation because minds are
<BR>
constrained too.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
