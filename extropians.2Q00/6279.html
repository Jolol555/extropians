<EM>&gt;From: Brian Manning Delaney &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bdelaney@infinitefaculty.org?Subject=Re:%20_The%20Apology_,%20Part%20II&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000626062608.33141.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">bdelaney@infinitefaculty.org</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>FWIW, I appreciate your attempt to rebuild a thoroughly obliterated bridge.  
<BR>
For that reason, I offer these thoughts:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I had a long, painful, but ultimately productive and interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussion with friends today about this. Although I remain extremely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disturbed and angry about many aspects of these proceedings, something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fruitful might be nonetheless be salvaged if we reflect on a number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;important issues. One is how this example can be analyzed as a case of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clearly (in my view) decent people coming into conflict over relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Far more importantly, and interestingly, is how this can shed light on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;group dynamics, above all the social psychology of opinion-formation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What needs explanation is: EVERYRONE I talked with who knows me thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I was entirely in the right (while noting that I at times wasn't turning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the other cheek where some people might -- but I have strong convictions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about that, which I'm also currently questioning), yet virtually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;EVERYONE on Extropians thought pretty much the opposite.
</EM><BR>
<P>First, you should not be surprised when people who know you tell you that 
<BR>
you are &quot;in the right.&quot;  Particularly while you are engaged in a long, 
<BR>
painful discussion with them.  People who know you have a much broader 
<BR>
contextual background against which to measure your behavior.  Their history 
<BR>
with you likely has already persuaded them that you are a person of 
<BR>
intelligence and integrity.  They are invested in their relationship with 
<BR>
you, and therefore have reason to protect that investment by &quot;being there&quot; 
<BR>
for you when you need it.  Does this mean that they are blowing smoke when 
<BR>
they tell you that you are &quot;in the right&quot; or that they are so biased as to 
<BR>
be incapable of objectively evaluating the situation?  Not necessarily, but 
<BR>
probably.
<BR>
<P>Second, you have again made one of the same mistakes that got this whole 
<BR>
mess going.  You have assumed that the people on this list are of one mind 
<BR>
on this (or any) issue.  Your earlier comments about anti-semitism painted 
<BR>
all the participants on this list with the same broad brush.  You are doing 
<BR>
it again by saying that we all thought you were in the wrong.  I personally 
<BR>
never thought you were wrong to express your opinions.  In fact I'm not so 
<BR>
sure that all the opinions you expressed were completely in error.  I have a 
<BR>
feeling I'm not alone.  Yet, as a participant on this list, I am painted 
<BR>
with the same broad brush as every other fungible Extropian.
<BR>
<P>Where I thought you were in error is: (1) your tendency to make a mountain 
<BR>
out of a mole hill; and, especially, (2) the beligerent and insensitive way 
<BR>
in which you expressed yourself while constructing that mountain.
<BR>
<P>My suggestions:
<BR>
<P>(1) When posting online, consider the audience.  If you are communicating 
<BR>
with strangers, don't make the mistake that they will assume you to be a 
<BR>
person of intelligence and integrity like your old friends will.  If you 
<BR>
think there is any reasonable chance that unwarranted offense might be taken 
<BR>
by your post, take every measure to avoid the possibly offensive language.
<BR>
<P>(2) When disagreements flare up (as they inevitably will), do not respond 
<BR>
while your emotions are flaring.  Walk away from the computer, go for a bike 
<BR>
ride, drink a beer, whatever, and come back to the keyboard with an open and 
<BR>
clear-thinking mind.
<BR>
<P>(3) Always remember: whatever the topic is, its not *that* important.  
<BR>
There's no need to feel that your integrity rides on every exchange you have 
<BR>
on the list.  90% of what goes on here could probably qualify as mental 
<BR>
masturbation anyway.  If its enjoyable, go with it.  If its a pain, its 
<BR>
simply not worth it.  If you really come across a jerk online, there is 
<BR>
nothing you can do to stop him from (a) being a jerk, (b) acting like a 
<BR>
jerk, or (c) realizing that he is a jerk.  That's simply the nature of 
<BR>
jerkism.
<BR>
