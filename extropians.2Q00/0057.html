</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;help but wonder whether the discussion might be more fruitful if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;considered more possible scenarios.  For instance, what if a community
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decided that all police officers had to have a &quot;shoulder cam&quot; that recorded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only when that officer was on duty, extending the highway patrol car
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;pull-over&quot; cams that have been in use in new Jersey now for a year or so?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Or even less intrusive, that courts were to decide that a search or an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arrest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that wasn't recorded was presumptively unconstitutional?  Or that an oral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contract that wasn't recorded was voidable? Could those be bad things?
</EM><BR>
<P>*I* don't see how they could possibly be bad things.  In fact that sort of 
<BR>
surveillance (in my opinion) is certainly coming, and few will complain 
<BR>
about it (except, maybe, for a few cops).  But I don't think that level of 
<BR>
surveillance would be enough for a time when almost everyone has the power 
<BR>
and knowledge which will be available to us once GNR tech is in wide use.
<BR>
<P>The minimalist surveillance you describe would prevent cops from treating 
<BR>
you like a King (Rodney or Martin L.), but would not prevent a Timothy 
<BR>
McVeigh from mixing up a batch of anthrax or assassination bots in his 
<BR>
backyard near-anything device.
