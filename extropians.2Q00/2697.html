Normally I don't respond to things here, I just lurk. But this may be the single
<BR>
&nbsp;biggest load of crap I've ever seen on this list.
<BR>
The idea that ONLY criminals have anything to fear from surveillance may be the
<BR>
most subtly authoritarian thing I've ever read.
<BR>
Do you really want someone watching what you do in private? Or, even everything
<BR>
you do in a public place, taped and available
<BR>
for public scrutiny? Well I, for one, couldn't care less that you want to live
<BR>
that way, I don't and I don't think many people really
<BR>
would. And, before this argument comes up, I do NOT believe that there wouldn't
<BR>
be someone in the government looking at
<BR>
tapes/videos, etc. just for one. A few years ago I.R.S. workers were caught
<BR>
looking through celebrity's files just to see what they
<BR>
saw. If I commit a crime (leaving aside the debate over what ought to be
<BR>
criminal) and get caught, then I get punished. If I just
<BR>
want to use the public space I'm paying for anyway without draconian regulations
<BR>
&nbsp;forcing me to submit to surveillance that's my
<BR>
business.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who think as you seem to (that anyone who isn't a criminal ought to
<BR>
have no problems with being watched
<BR>
everytime they leave their house, and that if you do you MUST be a criminal) are
<BR>
&nbsp;part of the reason for this country's problems.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me that you really believe the government won't search the tapes later
<BR>
&nbsp;for activities they deem 'harmful' and won't
<BR>
then target people doing that for further invasions of privacy. If you honestly
<BR>
believe that, you know nothing about history and the
<BR>
way people with power operate. The entire 'war on drugs' can be seen largely as
<BR>
a way for government to expand power
<BR>
while ignoring constitutional limitations on their actions. Property
<BR>
seizures/asset forfeitures aren't constitutional, and yet they exist
<BR>
because people can be scared into allowing it to happen. Giving people who've
<BR>
shown a fairly consistent record of being
<BR>
untrustworthy more power is insane.

<EM>&gt;Do you want to make many people miserable, you included? Then, vote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for transparent society.
</EM><BR>
<P>I, like most law-abiding citizens, have absolutely nothing to fear from a
<BR>
transparent society.  If your deeds are good, you have no interest in
<BR>
keeping them secret.  If you are willing to fight tooth and nail to keep
<BR>
your deeds hidden..., well do the math.
