<EM>&gt; Michael S. Lorrey is reputed to have said...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Lesson three: buy used equipment when you can, &quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I regret that I must disagree.  My experience is otherwise.....to wit...I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own a small business...that is...I am an Owner Operator (trucker)....I'm on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my first new truck...third truck overall.....my first one was a &quot;fleet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; truck&quot;....with 500K miles on it when i bought it....my second one was a MUCH
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nicer and better equiped &quot;owner-op&quot; truck..but still used with &quot;300K&quot;...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Both required approximately a thousand a month in maint. expense....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My current truck I spec'd myself and purchased new....LOTS of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; warranty......it's not costing near that in maint.....(naturally I'm VERY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; serious about Preventative Maint....)...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So....although Mike is probably right overall...my experience adds a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; qualifier....&quot;it depends&quot;....on the biz...on the conditions....etc...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, but how much did you pay for the different trucks? Are your
<BR>
maintenance savings more than your increased finance payments, interest,
<BR>
etc.? Do you need more insurance, or higher premiums?
<BR>
<P>There is a problem you deal with in knowing what you are buying, and
<BR>
from my own experience with vehicles, its easy for someone to slip you a
<BR>
mickey with a vehicle, while is much more difficult with computer
<BR>
equipment (either it does what its supposed to or it doesn't). Many
<BR>
people here on the list know that I did not have the best experience
<BR>
with the used Jeep Cherokee I bought. I basically got hosed. However,
<BR>
I'm now to the point where the money it has cost me so far is now less
<BR>
than what a new one would have cost me for the same utility. This is the
<BR>
first time I've ever gotten a bad deal on a used vehicle, and I've owned
<BR>
four different used vehicles prior to this (this is the second I've
<BR>
bought from a dealer).
