<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Then there are the kinds of

<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Cop killer&quot; bullets are essentially a media-generated urban

<EM>&gt; &gt; legend.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My point is that the cops in New York City are permitted to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bullets the general public cannot use -- the so-called &quot;cop killer&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bullets -- despite their patrolling streets packed with large numbers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of innocent bystanders.  I find it disturbing in the extreme that in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; New York the average citizen is essentially completely disarmed, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardly any weapon is too lethal for a cop walking the beat.  I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making any claims about the so-called &quot;cop killer&quot; bullets, except to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; note the irony of the cops using them after the public had been told
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how horrible they are.
</EM><BR>
<P>A lot of people I know who live and/or work in NYC carry, they just do so
<BR>
without a permit, and they make sure they don't do anything thats likely to get
<BR>
them searched by cops. The word from cops is that if a law abiding person shoots
<BR>
a perp in self defense, they just take the gun away. The smart thing most of
<BR>
these people know is that if they ever have to shoot a perp in self defense,
<BR>
they will just walk away from the scene and dispose of the gun, and keep their
<BR>
mouths shut. The people in NYC who get prosecuted for defending themselves are
<BR>
those who get obstinate about their actions being justified and who hang out for
<BR>
the cops to show up. The Police Commissioners hate it when the liberal press
<BR>
starts giving them crap about tolerating 'vigilante justice'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A few years ago an undercover transit cop (a division of the NYPD that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used to patrol the subways -- I believe they've since merged into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regular force) was saved by his bulletproof vest from fellow officers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who saw him draw his gun on a suspect and began shooting him (mostly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the back).  The case made the transit police look particularly bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since it seemed the officers may have assumed that the undercover cop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was a wrongdoer due to his race.  I think he sued the city
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successfully for many millions.  Subsequently the cops have shifted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the so-called &quot;cop killer&quot; bullets.  I guess today the undercover cop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be dead.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, and its happened already on one raid operation.
