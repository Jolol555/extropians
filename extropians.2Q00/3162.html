<P><EM>&gt; I'm sorry to bring this question up so directly

<EM>&gt; because it is (and should be) a sensitive issue, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for one would like to know the cause of Alexander
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Chislenko's death.  [snip]
</EM><BR>
<P>I for one would *not* like to know the details.
<BR>
<P>I would also like to honor Max's request that this
<BR>
not be discussed on-list out of respect for Sasha's
<BR>
family.  This is like the whole Clinton affair --
<BR>
there are some things that are just kept private.
<BR>
While you can argue that by running for public office
<BR>
Clinton may have made his private life public, the
<BR>
same claim cannot be made for Sasha.
<BR>
<P>If people do know and wish to correspond with Dan
<BR>
about it, they should feel free to do so.  Please
<BR>
understand I am not trying to censor anyone, but
<BR>
I do think that there are things that should be
<BR>
discussed in &quot;private&quot; forums (to the degree such
<BR>
exist) rather than a &quot;public&quot; forum which has
<BR>
public access archives.
<BR>
<P>There is an old saying...
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;Those who tell don't know, and those who know don't tell&quot;.
<BR>
<P>That is because the wisdom of some things is meaningless
<BR>
if you don't discover it for yourself.
