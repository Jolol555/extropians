<EM>&gt; The rest of the world is totally aware as to who controls the UN, I

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Europe, and I'm not so sure the Europeans feel this way.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The UN will not and cannot be representative of &quot;the planet&quot;.  It doesn't
<BR>
even represent the people of the US.  The UN is an
<BR>
irritatingly paternalistic organization that is a poster child for why the
<BR>
centralization of government is bad.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I was thinking of something else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And no, I don't want to live under one world govt, mainly because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would result in the entire world eventually becoming homogenous and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bland.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you considered how many people would have to die to get to that
<BR>
&quot;comfortable&quot; stage?  Only we wouldn't call it a &quot;titanic war&quot;, since
<BR>
history is written by the victors, right?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Other than the cultural diversity issues, the sooner the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better.  If we can't get rid of these horrible nation-states entirely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least let's have just one so we can avoid titanic wars.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The titanic wars between nation-states have bodycounts that are dwarfed by
<BR>
the bodycounts inside nation-states caused by ill-run governments.  I
<BR>
think it is quite plausible that those &quot;titanic wars&quot; *reduced* the total
<BR>
bodycount.  I don't see how a world government would not make this worse.
<BR>
<P>I guess this is a jurisdictional issue for you (&quot;It is much better to kill
<BR>
our people ourselves than to have other nation-states do it.&quot;).  I don't
<BR>
see how having a world monopoly on deciding who lives or dies is a good
<BR>
thing.  You are making the baseless assumption that you won't end up on the
<BR>
&quot;people it is okay to kill&quot; list that most governments seem to have.  The
<BR>
problem with a world government is that once you end up on that list for
<BR>
any reason, ridiculous or not, there is nowhere else you can go.  It
<BR>
certainly wouldn't be reasonable to expect any real justice in such a
<BR>
situation.
