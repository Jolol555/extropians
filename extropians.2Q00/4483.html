<P><EM>&gt;I've come to accept that some things can't be hurried, but by slowing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tempo of my perceptions and expectations and carefully paying attention to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the small signs of slow change in the developing plants I husband, I've 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;able to tap into a reservoir of insight and calm I never knew before.
</EM><BR>
<P>My Stepfather has been tapping into similar areas recently, but on a longer 
<BR>
time-scale, by cultivating a number of Bonsai plants.  After first getting 
<BR>
into the hobby, in his mid-50s, he loved it but was disappointed to learn 
<BR>
that he would probably never be a true Bonsai master, because such is said 
<BR>
to take sixty or more years.  I just mention it because a long time-scale 
<BR>
art such as this seems like something that might appeal to extropians.  I 
<BR>
may get into it myself one day, when/if I have my feet firmly planted in one 
<BR>
geographic location (most bonsais require daily watering).
<BR>
<P>Cheers, Bill
