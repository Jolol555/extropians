<EM>&gt; I was ambiguous. What I think I meant is that the specifics in terms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the percentile figures for taxation are not much use with no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consideration of how that money is being used (which can be well or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; badly, as you say).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Once you've decided to allow for some taxation, however (as opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; none at all, as Mike has suggested - and it is a vaild option) it makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very little sense to try and compare exactly how much freedom a country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has removed, via its taxes. There are simply far too many factors.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I disagree.  I think there are plenty of examples of what constitutes a
<BR>
reasonable upper bound for how much money a government should spend for a
<BR>
given service.  Even assuming that taxation does not equal theft if
<BR>
valuable services are received, any taxation above the demonstrable market
<BR>
rate for a given type of service *is* theft by any definition I can think
<BR>
of.
<BR>
<P>This is where the argument really begins.  In the vast majority of cases,
<BR>
government services are *grossly* overpriced.  If government services were
<BR>
as efficient and responsive as people claim they can be, privatization
<BR>
wouldn't be as attractive as it is.  
<BR>
<P>Looking at the &quot;best practices&quot; of various governments around the U.S.
<BR>
and combining them, I estimate that I could get a level of service as good
<BR>
or better than I currently receive for no more than 5% of my income, and
<BR>
probably a bit less.  However, in practice the government charges me
<BR>
greater than an order of magnitude over a reasonable market rate.  Not
<BR>
only that, but the government has no motivation to become more efficient. 
<BR>
I would be happy with direct tax provided services *if* they were
<BR>
comparable to what private industry could provide.  Unfortunately, it is
<BR>
difficult to devise a way to do this that doesn't eventually slip into
<BR>
inefficiency.  That efficient taxing agencies exist today is more of an
<BR>
accident than a stable long-term outcome.
