<EM>&gt;Spike, I have to disagree with this.  Intelligence and emotion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are two entirely different realms.  I would say that the more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intelligent you are, the more capable you may be of managing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or balancing &quot;conflicting&quot; emotions.  For example, emotions may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be very short-term reward based.  It takes intelligence to translate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that into a long term risk-benefit tradeoff analysis.
</EM><BR>
<P>Intelligence and emotions are not two entirely different realms. All too
<BR>
often people tend to categorize emotions in a negative light considering
<BR>
the downside of emotions that are obstreperous!  Who the heck spread this
<BR>
dirty meme?  &quot;Psst ... he's emotional, tis tis, what a pity.&quot;
<BR>
<P>One day we will be honored to be called emotional or to be congratulated
<BR>
that our emotions are so sharp, so aware, so alive, so Aristoi.  (This is
<BR>
directly from my talk at Extro 4.)
<BR>
<P>Accessing situations and pursues life wide-eyed is a clear indication that
<BR>
there is an emotion-based cooperation in correlation with the mechanics of
<BR>
intelligence in processing data.  Emotions do more work than function as a
<BR>
group of interconnected deep brain structures and involved in olfaction,
<BR>
emotion, motivation, behavior, and various autonomic functions.
<BR>
<P>Today, we are able to use our refine these emotions to enhance our mental
<BR>
capabilities in accessing situations, people and potential outcomes for our
<BR>
own self-protection and communication savvy.  But, more importantly the
<BR>
emotions of passion and joy, desire and excitement.
<BR>
<P>My view of intelligence is more than 50% based on a person's emotional
<BR>
intelligence, and less on his or her ability to copycat the ideas,
<BR>
writings, knowledge or others that is more a process of a photographic
<BR>
memory than an actual mental simulation of data and new way to look at the
<BR>
data with a creative and visionary ability.
<BR>
<P>Some emotions may be sort-term beneficial, but not always.  An orgasm has a
<BR>
short turn emotional benefit, but a persistent sense of curiosity and
<BR>
excitement about life is probably more beneficial to the lifespan of an
<BR>
individual. 
<BR>
<P>I agree with you, of course, that more intelligent one is, the more he or
<BR>
she can manage negative emotions.  I hasten to add that the more emotional
<BR>
a person is (beneficial emotions -sense awareness for example, or the
<BR>
ability to express oneself freely), the more he or she can develop and use
<BR>
intelligence.   
<BR>
<P>I think that it is important to consider the different types of emotions
<BR>
and to identify the emotions that are personally damaging - unnecessary
<BR>
anger, overreacting to problems, a tendency to causes disarray to oneself
<BR>
and to others; AND the emotions that are essential to our intelligence and
<BR>
our enjoyment of life - being aware of oneself and one's environment,
<BR>
ability to voice one's views, conscientiousness about other peoples
<BR>
feelings (sympathy), full use of one's senses, and the most important, the
<BR>
emotional intelligence to perceive the importance of a learning from
<BR>
mistakes but having the knowledge (wisdom, as suggested by Nadia) of
<BR>
knowing when to turn down the barometer of emotions and when to turn it up.
