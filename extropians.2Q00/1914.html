<EM>&gt; Speaking of unions . . .  My views on unions have evolved considerably over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the last few years as I've become more and more libertarian in my political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophy.  I don't see why people shouldn't be able to band together into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collective bargaining arrangements or why a union shouldn't be able to make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contract with a company that forbids the hiring of non-union employees.  Of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, state sanctioning shouldn't be tolerated, but I can see unions doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lot of good in a more libertarian world, especially in taking over and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decentralizing many of the functions of the state social welfare function.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many of the things that anarcho-capitalist theorists see as being provided by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privately-produced law agencies would be more effective if coupled with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social welfare unions that also had some economic functions such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collective bargaining.  Individuals would have to have the freedom to enter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and leave unions (with some costs imposed, I'm sure).  I wonder what others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think of such ideas?
</EM><BR>
<P>Problems with unions are that there is no public oversight, union
<BR>
leadership tends to be secretive (and tends toward corruption and
<BR>
resorts to violence to get the job done (this is not just a
<BR>
characteristic of the Teamsters)), and difficult to push alternative
<BR>
leadership candidates over incumbents. I highly oppose allowing unions
<BR>
to demand closed shops. This is a very anti-competetive thing, as well
<BR>
as refusing to allow more than one union to operate in the same shop. If
<BR>
I'm a worker, I want to be able to choose not only if I want to belong
<BR>
to a union or not, but to have a choice of unions. Unions also foster
<BR>
workplace harrassment of independent operators in open shops, and the
<BR>
worker greivance procedures they mandate tend to foster frivolous
<BR>
complaints.
