<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; And, if you're thinking about Lockerbie, it's worth bearing the alternative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; theories in mind. (You know exactly who was _supposed_ to be on board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Pan Am 109, but cancelled his party's reservation an hour before takeoff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and caught the next flight?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Clue: here in Scotland, 90% of the informed opinion is that the Lockerbie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; trial will deliver one of two verdicts -- &quot;not guilty&quot; or &quot;not proven&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I haddn't heard who was supposed to be on the flight, but I had heard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the defense had a supposed witness that claims a big US drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; operation at the airport in question, who is most likely an IRA stalking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; horse (considering how much the IRA owes Gadaffi, I don't doubt it). I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can't imagine that actual taped conversations of Gadaffi congradulating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the team would not make it an open and shut case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course, such evidence would make it an open and shut case. But I hope
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you'll pardon me for doubting that evidence that hard exists; if it did,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it'd have been produced by now (if only to shut up carping critics like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself :).
</EM><BR>
<P>I was under the impression that that was the evidence our intelligence people had
<BR>
gotten that caused us to authorize the bombing of Tripoli. I don't know if that
<BR>
evidence is being released, but that was the story at the time we bombed them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The person I was told was due to fly on Pan Am 109, incidentally, was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'Pik' Botha, the South African minister of defense, and his entourage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Note that I don't have a documentary source for this to hand, so I'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to do a lot of digging if you challenge me on it. So be it.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If this isn't just synchronicity in action, I find the current South
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; African government's mediation in getting the Libyans accused of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bombing a fair trial in a neutral country somewhat ... interesting.
</EM><BR>
<P>So you are saying it was actually an ANC plot? The ANC, incidentally, also did a
<BR>
lot of training in Libya. It seems that anyone who belongs to a terrorist group, or
<BR>
sympathizes with one, is coming out of the woodwork in defense of Libya, when Libya
<BR>
was the largest provider of training facilities for terrorist groups.... funny how
<BR>
that goes.
