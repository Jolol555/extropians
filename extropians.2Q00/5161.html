Well of course you have to look at it from their perspective (both the
<BR>
individuals, and staff of Wired). This is the first time they really
<BR>
sat down and figured out &quot;hey, you know what, with all these powerful
<BR>
new technologies something could actually go horribly wrong.&quot; Most of
<BR>
them anyway. Up to this point, a lot of the stuff in Wired has been fluff
<BR>
in terms of looking at the possible consequences. So Wired and its readers
<BR>
have I guess caught up to the extropians list circa 1995? (pick a date)
<BR>
<P>If they follow along our path then soon they will have to get into the
<BR>
whole singularity stuff, and whether or not accelerating it might provide
<BR>
another path for us instead of relinquishment or &quot;wait and see&quot; approaches.
<BR>
Have they even done one article on the singularity before?
