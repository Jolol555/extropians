Assertion: I would count myself a definite advocate of human
<BR>
meta-programming, genetic manipulation, and interfacing with microprocessor
<BR>
technology.  I recognize humanity as a beautiful actualization of classical
<BR>
evolution, but also that we are on the verge of accelerated, directed
<BR>
evolution via advanced technologies.  I embrace human self-modification (and
<BR>
what the heck, why not our evolutionary cousins?  Why not our ecosystem?).
<BR>
But, as with any new technology, I think it necessary to consider the social
<BR>
and economic implications.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Observations: 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Genetic engineering already seems to be creeping into acceptance.  It starts
<BR>
with genetic screening: inform parents, for example, of possible genetic
<BR>
anomalies in their embryonic offspring, 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
'Your child appears to have a predisposition towards acquiring Parkinsons
<BR>
someday, having a slow metabolism, and has a low count of tandem repeats on
<BR>
the novelty-seeking gene.  He'll probably have average intelligence.  Would
<BR>
you like to terminate? If you like, we can exert some influence on your next
<BR>
child.  Would you like to have a boy or a girl, Mr. Smith? We'll just filter
<BR>
your sperm through liquid albumin, detect the molecular weight differential
<BR>
of the DNA (the difference between X and Y chromosomal content) and implant
<BR>
the gender of your choice.  And we'll screen out those low-intelligence
<BR>
potentials if you like... And for $30.000 more, we can engineer your child
<BR>
superior motor-coordination potential so he/she'll have a better chance at
<BR>
that Basketball scholarship...'
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Where do you draw the line between rectifying genetic disease and choosing
<BR>
the eye color of your offspring?
<BR>
Is one okay and not the other?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Personally, I'd love to affect genetic optimization of my offspring.  But I
<BR>
think we need to be aware of the issues that arise: For example, the 'haves'
<BR>
will have 'better' offspring, while the 'have-nots' won't be able to afford
<BR>
all the 'kinder-mods'.  And what happens if and when everybody can afford
<BR>
it?  Are we all going to optimize our offspring's genetic predispositions
<BR>
towards some arbitrarily-chosen 'superior quality set'?  There goes the
<BR>
genetic diversity of the human race... It would be sad if humans turned out
<BR>
to have a gene pool like the poor cheetahs.  What happens if the environment
<BR>
changes drastically, say, due to an asteroid impact that we failed to
<BR>
prevent because nobody funded the hurtling-space-rock-defense program?  Will
<BR>
we have the genetic diversity to ensure the continued survival of our kind?
<BR>
And is the process of deliberately manipulating your child's genetic
<BR>
blueprint fair to the child?  It/he/she doesn't seem to have much of a
<BR>
choice in the matter at the time.  I can see it now: little Susan files a
<BR>
lawsuit against her parents for giving her basketball genes when all she
<BR>
ever wanted to be was a doctor...
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
As for direct interface between the nervous system and computer technology,
<BR>
it seems like an obvious and tangible transhumanist endeavor.  I spend a lot
<BR>
of my time pondering the integration of the human nervous system and
<BR>
microprocessors (and also the extensions of that basic interface -
<BR>
telepathy, anyone? How about downloading images from satellites, directly to
<BR>
your visual field?).  I would love to connect and learn from people with a
<BR>
similar vision.  I am currently seeking a graduate-level program, if such a
<BR>
thing exists, dedicated or related to the exploration of these
<BR>
possibilities.  I have thus far been unsuccessful, not because the idealists
<BR>
aren't out there, but because it seems like 'fringe science' like this just
<BR>
doesn't get a lot of funding (unless of course there is immediate military
<BR>
application - but must I really go out and join the Air Force to participate
<BR>
in this field?).  If any of you bright people know of anybody out there
<BR>
working on making this possible, I would be very interested in initiating
<BR>
contact with them.  I actually have an outline for an experiment I would
<BR>
love to try, on animal or insect models.
<BR>

Subject: a new thread
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Any thoughts on human genetic manipulation?  Say, with the purpose of
<BR>
creating a workable interface between an electronic microprocessor and a
<BR>
human mind?  Throw in some nanotechnology for physical interaction...
<BR>
Education equates to software development...  Implications?
