</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So lets evolve one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Everyone on all sides of the transparency debate will agree: if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fail to compensate downward the authority of government as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveillance becomes easier and cheaper, then we are all...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [what is the technical term I am serching for here?  Oh yes:]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...fucked.
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One angle I thought of that would make today different from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; previous u. surv. societies: in the past, the surveillors were humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hired to do a job.  They became overzealous in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prosecution because that was their perceived job.  Kinda like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traffic cops having an unspoken quota of speeding tickets they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must write.  Or they were just the kind of people who liked to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kick asses for no good reason.  So they did.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As cameras multiply, we need fewer enforcers, consequently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the few would use their limited resources in solving those crimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that which really pull in the profit: robbery, rape, murder, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We may begin to see the government more as a business than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as the traditional big brother figure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With big business we have the collective option of just saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no, or just saying less.  And we MUST exercise that option.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is the problem. Lets say a community sets up a surveillance net,
<BR>
even a competetive one, where every stoplight, every intersection, every
<BR>
public area has cameras where private businesses can bid to maintain and
<BR>
use them to enforce whatever laws the community wants to contract them
<BR>
to enforce. How is the business to make money? Why, they make the most
<BR>
money by writing the most citations. You'll have businesses bidding so
<BR>
high that they have to write tons of citations in order to recoupe the
<BR>
investment. Putting a profit incentive on law enforcement is as bad as
<BR>
giving policemen ticket quotas. 
<BR>
<P>I'd rather see it become a non-profit decentralized volunteer effort, a
<BR>
sort of digital neighborhood watch. Another thind I'd like to see in
<BR>
situations where citations are being written that there be first a
<BR>
warning written, so the offender understands that they actually broke
<BR>
the law, and giving them the benefit of the doubt so that they can be
<BR>
more careful in the future. Consequent citations on the same person
<BR>
should ramp up in amount each time to some top level, which would also
<BR>
give us the added benefit of analysing what fine level is truly a useful
<BR>
deterrent level and what is merely punitive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please allow me to develop this a little further.  What if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gradually turned law enforcement over to private industry?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let us start with that area of law that every one of us violates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; routinely, traffic law.  {Except of course the short list of non-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drivers here, Damien Broderick, John Grigg, Eliezer, et. al.}
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, put the jaywalking cops on them...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We speed.  We blow an occasional stop signs, we burn and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occasional red light.  We do other minor naughties in our cars,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do we not?  We seldom if ever get caught.
</EM><BR>
<P>And we demonstrate that the conditions under which we do so are not
<BR>
conditions which put others at risk. Conditions of no risk should follow
<BR>
the no harm, no foul rule.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What if our cars were instrumented to determine and log
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speed, km driven, traffic conditions, etc.  Then instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paying an occasional traffic fine, our driving safety would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be determined by an insurance company, who would presumably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take into account intangeable factors, such as the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there was no one about when you blew the red light, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then the company determines your insurance rate depending
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the number of close calls you caused, your speed, your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general tendency toward or away from traffic anarchy, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then if you dont like their offered rates, you are free to go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purchase insurance from one of their competitors.  Everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be strictly free enterprise, with the exception of one law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that each driver would need to carry at least 100k in liability,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not so different from what we have now.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is a really good idea. So long as we had true competition in the
<BR>
insurance industry. When they do all their calculations off the same
<BR>
tables, and every insurance company is re-insured by the same
<BR>
reinsurance syndicate, where do you get lower rates?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any takers?  Im a taker.  In the long run we would all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefit from such a system.  Of course we lose Queene's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desire to feel the satisfaction of having gotten away with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something.  I dont know what to say to that.  We wouldnt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get away with *anything* however the penalty for infraction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would not be large.  The occasional spirited jaunt to 150 kph
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on a deserted highway might cost you an extra 50 cents next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time you renew your insurance for instance.  Any absent-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minded talking-on-the-damned-cell-phone-induced near
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accident might cost you 50 to 100 bucks however.  And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of course your bill would be roughly proportional to the number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of km driven.
</EM><BR>
<P>here's an example: Once, several years ago, for about 6 months, I drove
<BR>
around with no license. It wasn't suspended or anything, I was on the
<BR>
west coast, I had a NH license, and I had not had a chance to get back
<BR>
to NH to renew my license before it expired, and I didn't want to get a
<BR>
drivers license from a state on the west coast, as insurance on the west
<BR>
coast is much higher than it was in NH, and for tax reasons as well.....
<BR>
During this time, I drove much more carefully than I had prior to that
<BR>
time, since I didn't want to get in an accident or get stopped, as I
<BR>
could NOT afford to get busted for that at the time. I drove at the
<BR>
speed limit, I used my turn signals, I came to a stop at all stop signs
<BR>
and traffic lights. I was one GOOD little boy, and I got away with it.
<BR>
That period pretty much cured me of my previous driving habits of going
<BR>
as fast as I could get away with, not using turn signals, etc. I used to
<BR>
get speeding tickets every 6 months or so. Since then, I've had one.
<BR>
One, in 7 years (and that was a fluke anyways....&lt;g&gt;).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But this is only one example.  In the long run I could imagine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where nearly all police work could be turned over to private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enterprise.  Then government would then have potential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competitors, thus breaking a long-standing power monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the associated corruption and inefficiency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>What I would not mind seeing is to remove the monopoly power that police
<BR>
have over traffic tickets. Under the law, its the only part of the law
<BR>
that average citizens cannot press charges over or arrest or cite people
<BR>
for. I would set the standard of evidence for average citizens writing
<BR>
such citations to require video and other sensory data (radar, lidar,
<BR>
etc), and give the reporting citizens a percentage of the fine to be
<BR>
applied to their insurance and licensing /registration fees. That way,
<BR>
the evidence submitted only corroborates what they witness themselves
<BR>
(thus violations that occur without any other traffic present are still
<BR>
unenforceable). Capping what they can make will limit the enthusiasm
<BR>
with which they will engage in law enforcement, but will result in a
<BR>
large roving population of law enforcers at any given time.
<BR>
<P>What do you think?
