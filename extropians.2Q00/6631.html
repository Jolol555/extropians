&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i remember seeing research in which the disruption of rem sleep
<BR>
completely prevented any learning in lab mice. a quick search in pubmed
<BR>
yielded a couple of more recent abstracts.

<P>Despite the evidence that sleep may facilitate memory, controversial findings
<BR>
concern the role of sleep states (NREM, REM). We put forward the hypothesis that
<BR>
sleep organization, i.e. the regular occurrence of NREM-REM cycles, more than
<BR>
sleep states per se, may be crucial for the retention of verbal material
<BR>
presented before sleep. An experiment was performed in which recall of verbal
<BR>
material was requested of young subjects after three different kinds of night
<BR>
sleep: undisturbed sleep, fragmented sleep without sleep cycles disorganization,
<BR>
and fragmented sleep interrupted with sleep disorganization. Morning recall of
<BR>
verbal material was impaired after the night with disturbed sleep cycles,
<BR>
whereas it was not after the night with preserved sleep cycles; the amount of
<BR>
REM was similar in both cases. We conclude that the recall of verbal material is
<BR>
greatly affected by sleep cycle disorganization.

<P>The idea that sleep could serve a cognitive function has remained popular since
<BR>
Freud stated that dreams were &quot;not nonsense&quot; but a time to sort out experiences
<BR>
[S. Freud, Letter to Wilhelm Fliess, May 1897, in The Origins of Psychoanalysis
<BR>
- Personal Letters of Sigmund Freud, M. Bonaparte, A. Freud, E. Kris (Eds.),
<BR>
Translated by E. Mosbacher, J. Strachey, Basic Books and Imago Publishing,
<BR>
1954]. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is associated with dream reports,
<BR>
is now known to be is important for acquisition of some tasks [A. Karni, D.
<BR>
Tanne, B.S. Rubenstein, J.J.M. Askenasy, D. Sagi, Dependence on REM sleep of
<BR>
overnight improvement of a perceptual skill, Science 265 (1994) 679-682; C.
<BR>
Smith, Sleep states and learning: a review of the animal literature, Biobehav.
<BR>
Rev. 9 (1985) 157-168]; although why this is so remains obscure. It has been
<BR>
proposed that memories may be consolidated during REM sleep or that forgetting
<BR>
of unnecessary material occurs in this state [F. Crick, G. Mitchison, The
<BR>
function of dream sleep, Nature 304 (1983) 111-114; D. Marr, Simple memory: a
<BR>
theory for archicortex, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. B. 262 (1971) 23-81]. We studied
<BR>
the firing of multiple single neurons in the hippocampus, a structure that is
<BR>
important for episodic memory, during familiar and novel experiences and in
<BR>
subsequent REM sleep. Cells active in familiar places during waking exhibited a
<BR>
reversal of firing phase relative to local theta oscillations in REM sleep.
<BR>
Because firing-phase can influence whether synapses are strengthened or weakened
<BR>
[C. Holscher, R. Anwyl, M.J. Rowan, Stimulation on the positive phase of
<BR>
hippocampal theta rhythm induces long-term potentiation that can be
<BR>
depotentiated by stimulation on the negative phase in area CA1 in vivo, J.
<BR>
Neurosci. 15 (1977) 6470-6477; P.T. Huerta, J.E. Lisman, Bidirectional synaptic
<BR>
plasticity induced by a single burst during cholinergic theta oscillation in CA1
<BR>
in vitro, Neuron 15 (1995) 1053-1063; C. Pavlides, Y.J. Greenstein, M. Grudman,
<BR>
J. Winson, Long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus is induced preferentially
<BR>
on the positive phase of theta-rhythm, Brain Res. 439 (1988) 383-387] this
<BR>
experience-dependent phase shift, which developed progressively over multiple
<BR>
sessions in the environment, is consistent with the hypothesis that circuits may
<BR>
be restructured during REM sleep by selectively strengthening recently acquired
<BR>
memories and weakening older ones.
