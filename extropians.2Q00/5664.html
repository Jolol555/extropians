<EM>&gt;Thats how much crime is here as well, only the media spins the story based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the circumstances. If Bum A was a woman and Bum B was a man, its a case of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'domestic violence' or 'stalking'. If Bum A is black and bum B is white, its a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'racist hate crime killing', while if it were the other way around, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'gang violence'. If the ratty apartment were near a school campus 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and both bums
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were students, it would be a 'school shooting'. If Bum B was working 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for Bum A,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it would be a 'crazed worker going postal' incident, and if the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'apartment' was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the back of Bum A's van, then its 'murder on the highways'.

<P>Mike, are there legal definitions of domestic violence, stalking, 
<BR>
racist crime, hate crime or gang crime where you live?  If so, are 
<BR>
you saying that the media report a different crime than what the 
<BR>
police report?  It seems like a suspect could easily win a slander 
<BR>
suit against a news organization that deliberately misreported a 
<BR>
crime or an arrest that never occurred.
