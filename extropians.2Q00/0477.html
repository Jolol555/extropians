<EM>&gt; 3:20 AM,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Teachers are hardly low paid. The median teacher salary for a job that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only takes 3/4 of the year (and provides over a month of vacation during
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the school year), is above $30,000, for an annualized salary of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; $40,000.00. Not bad at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For a person with a Bachelor's degree, certification and a requirement to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; update their eduction every three years?  I was planning on being a science
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; education teacher specializing in computer science.  I put myself through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; college doing programming on the side.  By the end of my freshman year, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was making more than the starting salary for teachers in Florida.  By the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time I finished my sophmore year, I was offered a job paying twice what a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teacher makes here.  I wrapped up my two years into an Associate's Degree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and switched my major to Business Administration.  By the time I got my B.A,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was making triple what a teacher makes here.  A job is low-pay when it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't compete with other industries seeking the same skills.  Schools here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get the worst students or the ones that are anti-money and take the low pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for altruistic reasons.
</EM><BR>
<P>Considering that the average non science/engineering/business/law major
<BR>
makes a distinctly small fraction of the income of the more
<BR>
'professional', its not bad at all, especially considering that most
<BR>
education majors have little trouble getting most if not all of their
<BR>
educations subsidized.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The only problem with the plan is letting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the NEA get to meddle in the curriculum. I would not accept a plain old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; teacher for such an important job. Anyone who teaches such a course must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have training in constitutional law, be a veteran, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ahhh....  I thought there was more to it.  I couldn't believe that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really would let a regular school teacher from the Liberal NEA rate students
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on their right to vote and bear arms.  This makes more sense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The civics courses in this country have been gutted by the NEA et al
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; over the past 40 years in order to make the population ignorant,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pliable, and easy to program with propaganda.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the real problem.  You want the state to have this sort of control,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as long as you get to define what sort of teacher exists.  As soon as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone else replaces your teacher with their teacher, the system is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longer appealling.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I say below, so long as the curriculum is set by a panel of
<BR>
constitutional scholars, and classes can be audited by anyone who wants
<BR>
to make sure the curriculum is being adhered to, I have no problem,
<BR>
ultimately, with who teaches it, because setting up the system properly
<BR>
ensures that individuals who are detrimental will not wind up in, or
<BR>
last very long in, such a position.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Since the Constitution is not a matter of partisan politics (anyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; attempts to subvert it is, in fact, committing treason), then there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be no such thing as 'buting the party line' by the kids. If they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; want to be enfranchised, they pass the course, just as if they want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; drive a car, they pass a course. Don't like it? Why not? You folks are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; arguing the same thing for carrying a gun. Majority rule has killed more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people in the last century than anything else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree.  Majority rule is scary.  That's why I cringe at the idea that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right to vote or bear arms could be based on an education system that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controlled by majority rule (the state).  But where did you get the idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the Constitution is not a matter of partisan politics.  Certainly the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun debate should have shown that there is not general agreement on what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Constitution says or means.  You are sure that your interpretation is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correct and that the others are deliberately dishonest.  What you don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realize is that the others have the same opinion as you.  In such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situation, how could anyone agree on whose interpretation of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Constitution should be taught?
</EM><BR>
<P>Constitutional issues  are left to the courts, except in the case of
<BR>
Constitutional Amendment. Contra-constitutional legislation and
<BR>
administrative/executive ignorance or contravention (which is what most
<BR>
of the population thinks is ok if the slim majority agrees to it) has no
<BR>
place in manipulating the constitution. The bar for Amendments to pass
<BR>
is set as high as it is for the expressed purpose of mandating that any
<BR>
amendment be accepted on a bipartisan basis. Thus, the Constitution is
<BR>
not a matter of partisan politics (no matter how much some people would
<BR>
like it to be).
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your plan doesn't sound bad.  I just don't see how you can implement it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using the state or its education system as a tool.  Such tools always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; degenerate down to the lowest common denominator.  Given our two-party
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system, we will never have agreement about what should be taught in schools.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would implement a curriculum written by a panel of the top
<BR>
constitutional scholars. Heck, I'd even include Lawrence Tribe on the
<BR>
panel, as liberal as he is.
