<P>
In today's issue of the journal &quot;Science&quot; Dr. Robert P Lanza reports that clones
<BR>
made from old cows should live at least as long as regular cows, using several
<BR>
standard measures of cellular aging he found they're made of cells that act more
<BR>
youthfully than normal cows of their age. He even found the clones have telomeres
<BR>
that are slightly longer than average. Dr. Lanza says his cloned cows &quot;could be the
<BR>
longest lived cows on the planet&quot;. He also reports that in studies of serially cloned
<BR>
mice a trend toward lengthening of the telomere has also been found. Apparently if
<BR>
Dolly the sheep's telomeres really are shorter than normal it must be an abnormality
<BR>
of some sort rather than a fundamental flaw in the cloning process. Michael West of
<BR>
Advanced Cell Technology says this is all very good news as he is trying very hard
<BR>
to use a variation of the technique to make spare parts for people and wouldn't want
<BR>
them to ware out before the rest of the body.
<BR>
<P>More good news, in the same issue of Science the first unequivocal success in using
<BR>
gene therapy to cure a patient was reported. Dr. Alain Fischer treated two babies who
<BR>
had a lethal hereditary disease called SCID, 10 months after the treatment none of
<BR>
his tests could find any difference between his patients and normal healthy children.
