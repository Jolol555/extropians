IS THE FDA IN CONTEMPT OF COURT?
<BR>
By William Faloon
<BR>
The legal tide is turning against the FDA. A new lawsuit accuses the FDA
<BR>
of committing acts that are contrary to a Federal Appellate Court ruling,
<BR>
the United States Constitution, the Administrative Procedures Act, and a
<BR>
law Congress enacted to protect the right of consumers to access dietary
<BR>
supplements. This case seeks to hold FDA officials in contempt of court
<BR>
for their unlawful conduct.

<BR>
<P>CELLULAR NUTRITION FOR VITALITY AND LONGEVITY
<BR>
Vitality means energy plus resistance to stress. Cells produce energy
<BR>
through a process called &quot;cellular respiration.&quot; But oxidative stress
<BR>
caused by free radicals can damage the cell and inactivate cellular
<BR>
respiration. The cell therefore mobilizes an antioxidant defense system to
<BR>
protect itself against oxidative assault.
<BR>
Nature in her economy created one molecule to serve both purposes.
<BR>
Bioenergetic fuel and master antioxidant, CoQ10 plays vital roles in both
<BR>
cellular respiration and antioxidant defense.

NEW RADIOTHERAPY TECHNIQUE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AGAINST CANCER
<BR>
The February 15 2000 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of
<BR>
Sciences reported on a new proprietary radiotherapy technology that,
<BR>
administered in one dose, cured implanted cancers in 28 out of 30 mice.
<BR>
(Disappearance of the tumor with absence for one year was considered a
<BR>
cure.) NewRx Corporation's scientists injected a radiotherapy drug and
<BR>
targeting antibody separately at different times. The two drugs join at
<BR>
the tumor where the antibody locates, limiting radiation exposure to
<BR>
healthy tissue. The body promptly eliminates radiation that does not join
<BR>
the antibody.

<P>OLDER TEA DRINKERS HAVE STRONGER BONES
<BR>
About 10 million Americans suffer from osteoporosis. Their bones become
<BR>
porous and more prone to fractures. Another 18 million have low bone
<BR>
density, putting them at increased risk for the painful and debilitating
<BR>
disorder. High caffeine intake has been associated with decreasing bone
<BR>
density. But a new British study, reported in the American Journal of
<BR>
Clinical Nutrition, found that while tea contains caffeine, it also offers
<BR>
protective benefits.

DISEASE THERAPY PROTOCOLS
<BR>
-------------------------
<BR>
HEPATITIS B
<BR>
Hepatitis B is most commonly spread by physical contact with contaminated
<BR>
blood as in the sharing of nonsterilized needles or by sexual relations.
<BR>
Symptoms of hepatitis B range from loss of appetite, weakness, body aches,
<BR>
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, hives, joint pains, yellowing of the
<BR>
skin and eyes (jaundice), and dark urine, to a &quot;unique&quot; distaste for
<BR>
tobacco. The latter symptom often characterizes a &quot;full-blown&quot; hepatitis
<BR>
infection.
<BR>
The protective role of selenium against hepatitis B viruses was reported
<BR>
in early January of 1997 in the Journal Biological Trace Element Research.
<BR>
The study reported that in areas of China with high rates of hepatitis B
<BR>
and primary liver cancer, high levels of dietary selenium reduce
<BR>
liver-cancer incidence and hepatitis B infection.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2389/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html">http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2389/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html</A>
<BR>
<P>HEPATITIS C
<BR>
The hepatitis C virus does most of its damage by latching onto molecules
<BR>
of iron and delivering massive free radical damage to liver cells. These
<BR>
free radicals can mutate cellular DNA to cause hepatocellular carcinoma,
<BR>
and they can kill large numbers of liver cells. Liver dysfunction wreaks
<BR>
havoc throughout the body. Successful eradication of the hepatitis C virus
<BR>
from the body requires that iron levels in the liver and blood be at very
<BR>
low levels, and thus it can be said that high stores of iron in the liver
<BR>
preclude successful therapy against the hepatitis C virus. It is mandatory
<BR>
to reduce iron levels in the body before initiating treatment with
<BR>
interferon-ribavirin combination therapy.
<BR>
The FDA-approved therapy to treat hepatitis is a 6-month regimen of
<BR>
injectable alpha-interferon.  Hepatitis C patients exhibit, at best, only
<BR>
a 20% response to treatment with alpha-interferon. (Initially, 40 to 50%
<BR>
may have a response, but most relapse). When the antiviral drug ribavirin
<BR>
is combined with interferon, the response rate improves two- to tenfold.
<BR>
The standard regimen consists of 800 to 1200 mg a day of orally
<BR>
administered ribavirin taken in 3 divided doses for 6 months (200 to 400
<BR>
mg, 3 times a day). At this time, however, the FDA says that ribavirin can
<BR>
be used only after a patient has already failed a 6-month regimen of
<BR>
alpha-interferon therapy. The FDA's concern about ribavirin stems from the
<BR>
appearance of anemia seen in 10% of treated patients. (The anemia
<BR>
disappears after cessation of ribavirin therapy but could have a
<BR>
deleterious effect upon already sick individuals.)

PRODUCT OF THE WEEK
<BR>
-------------------
<BR>
CURCUMIN
<BR>
Curcumin is a potent antioxidant with specific antiviral,
<BR>
anti-inflammatory, anticancer and cholesterol-lowering effects.
<BR>
Curcumin is especially recommended for hepatitis C patients. One study
<BR>
found it to be more effective than green tea extract in suppressing viral
<BR>
damage to liver cells. Curcumin induces cancer cell apoptosis. Apoptosis
<BR>
can be defined simply as programmed cancer cell death. Cancer researchers
<BR>
are focusing in on agents that induce apoptosis as the next generation of
<BR>
cancer drugs. Many of the nutrients in the cancer treatment protocol such
<BR>
as selenium, vitamin A, green tea and vitamin D3 induce apoptosis.
<BR>
The most effective nutrient available to induce apoptosis may be curcumin.
<BR>
Curcumin is an antioxidant extract from the spice turmeric that produces a
<BR>
wide range of health benefits. Cancer patients should be taking 2000 mg to
<BR>
4000 mg a day of curcumin extract with a heavy meal. In a wide range of
<BR>
cancer cells, curcumin has been shown to induce cell shrinkage, chromatin
<BR>
condensation, DNA fragmentation and block cellular signal transduction,
<BR>
all of which are characteristics of apoptosis according to an article
<BR>
published in the journal Nutrition and Cancer USA (26/1 1996).
