<P><EM>&gt; I liked Mike's story about how he changed his driving behaviour and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connected it with the article written by Professor Meadows about how driving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of these new Honda cars with an electronic fuel consumption meter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely changed her driving behaviour. (Other car companies are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; introducing them as well).  As she said, instant feedback is what we need,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and lots of it! If we could see instantly what the effect was of every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action we took, it would enable us to amend our behaviour immediately and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lessen any bad results. Not just car driving, but everything, from leaving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lights on, turning up the central heating, having a six-litre engine instead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a one-litre, voting for Gore, etc. And, of course, if crime had an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instant negative feedback, that would also reduce.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've met Donella Meadows, she lives across the river, and I've seen her around
<BR>
town in the 'thing'. It looks like any other car with the exception of the
<BR>
covers over the rear wheels. She writes her columns typically for our local
<BR>
paper, the Valley News, and she is the founder of the Sustainability Institute.
<BR>
I used to find her columns to be out to lunch, but I've noticed that in the last
<BR>
year, as she's been doing a lot more hands on work, such as driving her Honda
<BR>
hybrid car, she has mellowed her previously notorious tree hugger attitudes. She
<BR>
is adored by the crunchy crowd in these parts though, which causes me some
<BR>
discomfort at the idea that I find myself actually agreeing with some of her
<BR>
more reasonable columns. She even has said positive things about hunters, which
<BR>
even she admits is a revolution for her...
<BR>
<P>She is quite correct about this instant feedback thing. She has recently asked
<BR>
for designers to come up with a power meter that an average person can
<BR>
understand, that is designed to look like an attractive appliance for the home,
<BR>
so you can see, sitting in your living room, what you are spending on energy
<BR>
just 'sitting there'. Its a rather decent idea. Of course, those with the money
<BR>
to burn aren't going to give a rats ass how much they use.
