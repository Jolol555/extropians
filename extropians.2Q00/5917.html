<EM>&gt; shows a bad long term trend.  I sure hope it has changed lately.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is a sobering figure.  War related deaths in the 20th century running
<BR>
about 110 million, almost three times the per-capita figures of the 17th,
<BR>
18th, and 19th centuries.
<BR>
<P>The authors show a correlation between countries with high percentages
<BR>
of young men and countries with a warlike record today.  This probably
<BR>
doesn't work too well across the centuries, as I am assuming that the
<BR>
shorter lifespans of the past would have put more people in the young
<BR>
demographics.
<BR>
<P>It's not clear that it is causative either in today's world, as there
<BR>
is are obvious geographic and cultural connections among the third
<BR>
world countries with many young people, beyond just their demographic
<BR>
similarities.  Uganda has more in common with Rwanda than with Sweden
<BR>
any way you look at it.
<BR>
<P>The figures I found for warfare were about 50 million deaths (military and
<BR>
civilian) in WWII, and about 20 million for WWI.  This leaves 40 million
<BR>
unaccounted for in the chart.  If you include the Russian revolution and
<BR>
the Stalinist purges, that could account for the bulk of the remainder,
<BR>
although the latter would probably not be considered war related.
<BR>
<P>Libertarians tend to say, &quot;wars are caused by governments,&quot; and that is
<BR>
the end of the analysis.  This is too simplistic: governments have been
<BR>
around for a long time, but here we have a big increase in warfare in
<BR>
the past 100 years.
<BR>
<P>It is perhaps encouraging that at least 70% of the deaths occured in
<BR>
the first half of the century, despite the population being twice as
<BR>
high in the 2nd half on average.  Perhaps that will turn out to have
<BR>
been the peak and now we are on a downslope towards historical levels.
