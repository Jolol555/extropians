<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to me, there are two major aspects to religion -- the content and
<BR>
the form. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one common, perhaps essential, feature of the content of all
<BR>
religions is an absolute system of values. that is, the believers of the
<BR>
religion accept certain values on faith alone. i do not feel that this
<BR>
aspect of religion is amenable to something so decidedly rational as
<BR>
extropianism.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the other hand, i do not want to imply that no absolute value
<BR>
exists (i do not know whether any does). the extropians, as a group, must
<BR>
share certain values, and perhaps hold those as self-evident. rationalism
<BR>
is almost certainly among these. perhaps it could serve as an absolute
<BR>
meta-value for an extropian religion. however, so far i do not see any
<BR>
difference between this &quot;religion&quot; and a scientific community. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i feel if there is anything from religion that would benefit the
<BR>
extropian movement, it would be the formal aspect. another feature common
<BR>
to all religions is the practice of ceremony.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i suspect that all human beings possess an inborn religious
<BR>
instinct ... a need for purpose and faith ... for the &quot;spiritual.&quot; this
<BR>
aspect of religion is completely oriented to the subjective experience;
<BR>
one can not say that any sentiment is untrue. perhaps this is what the
<BR>
scientific community lacks (or rather, wants, but subconsciously and
<BR>
therefore in-efficiently) and what the extropian movement can provide.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is anything shared as ubiquitously as rationalism amongst
<BR>
extropians, it would be a forward-looking attitute, an anticipatory
<BR>
excitement about the future. indeed, i daresay there is something
<BR>
spiritual, some &quot;faith&quot; in this sentiment. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while &quot;faith&quot; may not sound very rational, it becomes so when we
<BR>
consider ourselves as part of the whole rather than outside it. we are,
<BR>
after all, still trapped in human brains. human brains need faith; in
<BR>
fact, faith is probably one of the most powerful motivators (right after
<BR>
fear?). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now then, perhaps extropianism, as the step beyond science, should
<BR>
provide some ceremony to reinforce its most valuable asset -- the
<BR>
anticipation, however vague, that the future will be better, will be
<BR>
_made_ better, than the present. in my opinion, this emphasis on the
<BR>
formal element would maximize the benefits of religion while minimizing
<BR>
its many detriments.
