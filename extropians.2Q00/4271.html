<EM>&gt; What I mean is the difference between someone watching a moon landing

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In either case there is a delay, and even if you had instant (FTL) TV
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signals from the moon to your TV in 1969 there still is no way that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see that you actually are going &quot;back in time&quot; or causing any kind of

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By classical physics, you are right.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; With relativity things happen differently.

<EM>&gt; If you are standing next to Fred, and are stationary relative to him,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time moves at the same speed for both of you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are walking past Fred, your time is a little slower.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are flying past Fred in a spaceship at near light speed, it is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lot slower.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are a photon, and flying past him at the speed of light, time is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stationary for you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are flying past him at faster than the speed of light, time for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you goes backwards. Hence, you arrive before you left.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I keep hearing this argument, but as far as I can understand, this rests
<BR>
solely upon the fact that an arbitrary decision has been made that nothing
<BR>
can move faster than the speed of the light.  Because of this whenever
<BR>
something comes up that appears to be able to move faster than the speed of
<BR>
light, or invalidate the argument that nothing can move faster, this theory
<BR>
reverses the situation and says &quot;ah, in that case it must be moving
<BR>
backwards in time because nothing can move faster than light.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This is circular reasoning and rests on the premise that the mathematical
<BR>
equations of special relatively are exactly correct in all cases.
