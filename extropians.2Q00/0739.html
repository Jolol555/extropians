<EM>&gt; &gt; The most important precondition that must apply before a market can

<EM>&gt; &gt; function properly is that the market must be _fair_. That is, it is

<EM>&gt; &gt; necessary for competitors to abide by contracts, obey market regulations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (which should admittedly be as minimal as possible), and compete on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the merits of their products.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, a free market requires that companies:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) refrain from using physical force to coerce others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) abide by the terms of any contracts they voluntarily agree to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3) refrain from committing fraud (in a narrow sense) in the course of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business dealings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's it. Nothing else.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I don't agree.
<BR>
<P>A free market requires that companies don't use physical force to coerce
<BR>
others; it _also_ requires that they don't maliciously try to damage
<BR>
a competitor by using bribes to remove their customers. I use the term
<BR>
&quot;bribe&quot; here in the sense of some inducement that ties the acceptor into
<BR>
some form of behaviour. Classic case: Microsoft's offer (and threat)
<BR>
to Vobis, that they'd supply Vobis with MS-DOS and Win 3.1 licenses
<BR>
for a pittance, _and_ buy up their existing DR-DOS licenses, _if_ Vobis
<BR>
signed an exclusive deal with Microsoft (to supply MS-DOS on _every_ PC
<BR>
their sold). This action wasn't taken in order to make Microsoft money;
<BR>
it was taken in order to remove a major customer from Digital Research
<BR>
and _prevent_ them selling back into that market.
<BR>
<P>One might argue that as the authors of MS-DOS, Microsoft could charge
<BR>
whatever price they like for it. However, in this case they offered Vobis
<BR>
a deal with strings attached -- a huge discount, _if_ they promised never
<BR>
to deal with a competitor. The goal was long-term, to trade short-term
<BR>
profits against the possibilities arising from excluding a competitor from
<BR>
the market.
<BR>
<P>A second point: you didn't ask what the consequences of allowing cartels
<BR>
might be. For example: personnel costs are a major overhead for all
<BR>
companies. Assume a cartel forms; the members can all agree to cut
<BR>
their wages by 50%. The usual employee response -- walk to someone who
<BR>
pays a sensible wage -- is no longer valid in this scenario because
<BR>
there is a conspiracy to set prices between the companies in their market.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Exactly what companies compete on is up to their customers. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really. The _final_ consumers probably never get a say, if there's
<BR>
a supply chain. I don't get a choice in the products on sale in my local
<BR>
supermarket; the supermarket decides what it's willing to stock, and all
<BR>
I get to do is choose between brands. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In some markets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technical features may be the dominant consideration, but in others it may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be price, simplicity, reliability, company reputation, service and support,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or just about anything else imaginable. There is no place in a free market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system for self-appointed 'experts' who debate what criteria they think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumers *ought* to use, and second-guess the decisions of the market by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government fiat.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Like it or not, such people exist -- inside companies, as often as not.
<BR>
<P>One of my co-workers used to work next to the Censor for Scotland. The
<BR>
censor was simply the buyer for all videos, computer games, and books
<BR>
at the largest distributor chain in Scotland, one with 30% of the market.
<BR>
If he chose not to stock something, the _other_ distributors would avoid
<BR>
it on the assumption that the something wouldn't be profitable -- thus
<BR>
locking the something out of 90% of the retail market.
<BR>
<P>This guy had no legal standing, was not a government employee, and 
<BR>
officially didn't exist. Nevertheless, he kept videos he disapproved of
<BR>
out of a national-level market, and there was no market feedback to let
<BR>
his employers know that what he was doing was 'wrong'. (After all,
<BR>
if nobody sells it, its sales potential is zip. Right?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The best known way of running an economy is to establish a rule of law which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constrains force and fraud and enforces contracts, and then do *nothing else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatsoever*. The resulting market will not always produce the best results
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imaginable, but it *will* always produce better results than any other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system that has ever been tried.
</EM><BR>
<P>Please point me at a controlled crossover experiment that verifies this
<BR>
experimentally. Until you can do so, I'm going to take this as just more
<BR>
libertarian polemic.
<BR>
<P>Clue: your solution to the economic problems that bedevil us is
<BR>
bewitchingly simplistic -- much like the core meme behind Christianity.
<BR>
Show me a miracle, _then_ I'll believe. Until then, I believe the real
<BR>
world is a much more complex place than you seem to realise.
