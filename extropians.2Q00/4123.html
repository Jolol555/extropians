<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(BYW, the appropriate response to Nazis is fear -- and eugenics today is 
<BR>
not quite the same as it was when Hitler's crew forsaw a future of allsame 
<BR>
aryan superior beings. We extropians are hardly looking liek we'll be 
<BR>
conforming to same standards, I've heard too many people saying they want 
<BR>
telescopic eyes, steel lobster claws, 6 foot wings, silicon skin, and 
<BR>
talons...  but it still should be feared on some levels. For instance, can 
<BR>
our economical system survive a huge influx of super geniuses? Super 
<BR>
athletes? Super musicians and artists? Might this throw us so out of balance 
<BR>
as to make everything in place topple? )
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      An outsider could be forgiven for thinking that Extropians are in some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  way similar to the Nazi party. We strive to eradicate the genetic crap 
</EM><BR>
which 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is inherent in mankind. We are trying to produce a super race of near 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfect 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  humans 
</EM><BR>
Hm... speak for yourself. I am not into creating any kind of, certainly not 
<BR>
an uber-race!! I would rather eradicate the whole notion of race. Already I 
<BR>
hate the conformity that runs rampant on this planet. If I had the option,  I 
<BR>
would alter THAT genetic piece -- the one that makes us think in terms of 
<BR>
race, first order of the day!!!!!
<BR>
<P>I like mankind's flaws and foibles. I like our physical limitations, for they 
<BR>
cause us to think, to get smarter. To build technology! I like abberations 
<BR>
and diversity.
<BR>
Sure, I'd like to go forward to improving on my self with the help of 
<BR>
biotechnology, especially in terms of longevity, but I do not look at it as 
<BR>
ridding all of humanity of inferiority. I think people should choose what 
<BR>
upgrades thay want - or none!. For example if we want to be short and puny, 
<BR>
we should be!  Especially if Horse Jockeying is our game... If we want to be 
<BR>
made MORE inferior by todays standards (like having our skin unable to 
<BR>
withstand light since we will live indoors all our lives) then that also 
<BR>
should be available, no?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Who will decide which people will live forever ?. Do we let a Peadophile 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  murderer live forever ?. Do we &quot;Re-educate/brainwash them&quot; or patch their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  wetware to conform to OUR model of an exceptable transhuman.  Or do we 
</EM><BR>
just 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  gas them ?.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>If you mean us, on this list :
<BR>
<P>Of course it is not within &quot;our&quot; jurisdiction to overpower others and make 
<BR>
them do anything.  However, biotech will probably not make people immortal - 
<BR>
unable to die- so if governtment sponsored capitol punishment (uncivilized 
<BR>
behavior IMO) survives, then executions will still take place, even if you've 
<BR>
been coded to live longer. Perhaps some form of painless brain implants will 
<BR>
solve some violent criminal behavior, but a lot of ethical questions will 
<BR>
arise from such treatments, if they disable him/her or change them in any way 
<BR>
that makes them unrecognizable as themselves. 
<BR>
N
<BR>
<P>(Not sure what pedophiles have to do with this, but psychology is already 
<BR>
trying to find medications and treatments for criminal compulsions. The 
<BR>
problem is they aren't terribly effective - it's hard to get them to take the 
<BR>
medications once released.)
