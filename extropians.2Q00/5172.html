</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Actually I was thinking more of a society of people enlightened enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;realize that what's good for the whole is good for the individual.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If people were enlightened enough to realize that, wouldn't they be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enlightened enough to be prosperous in a free society? Aren't you saying 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only society in which communism would work would be one where it is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;needed? (I'm of the opinion that the best thing about communism is that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doesn't work)
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Enlightenment&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;business acumen.&quot;  Think of W.R. 
<BR>
Hearst, Rothschilds, J.P. Moran, Rockefeller, Bill Gates.  To they strike 
<BR>
you as &quot;enlightened&quot; individuals?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;It's simply a matter of realizing that the surest way to keep your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;neighbor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;from stealing your bread is to be sure that he has enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;keep his own belly full.  I call it &quot;enlightened self-interest.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The surest way to prevent someone from stealing from you is to set up a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government which will steal for you for him?
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; is 
<BR>
stealing?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Either way, you're left with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the same amount.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's much more to your self interest to live in a society where someone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;steals from you is considered a criminal, because you are allowed to defend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yourself against him, and he can go to jail. In either case, the result is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that there are less people among the populace who are going to steal from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;others.
</EM><BR>
<P>The recent dip in the national crime statistics notwithstanding, it doesn't 
<BR>
seem to me that capitalism has been very effective at discouraging theft.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Ensuring that your neighbor has enough bread to keep his belly full is his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resposibility, not yours.
</EM><BR>
<P>All that says is that we currently live in a capitalistic society.  To which 
<BR>
I can only agree.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;He would have more options available to help him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;meet this need under capitalism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Communism says &quot;to each according to his *need*.&quot;  Capitalism says &quot;to each 
<BR>
according to his luck and ability.&quot;  This alone would lead me to believe 
<BR>
that you'd have a much better chance of having your &quot;needs&quot; met in an 
<BR>
optimally communistic society.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Unfortunately such a society is unlikely to be stable for long as long as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;there is not enough to go around for *everyone*.  But hopefully that minor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;problem will soon be solved by the good folks over at Foresight :)
</EM><BR>
<P>This part of my post you didn't respond to, and this is the most important 
<BR>
part of what I said.
