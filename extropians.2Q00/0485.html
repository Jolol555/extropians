</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Easy question, now consider we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  about to see the next round with the wearable computers.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  is 1980 all over again.  Then it was the new desktop computers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Now it is the palm pilots and their logical descendants the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  wearables.  Getting these gadgets and learning to use them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  will divide the haves from the have nots even more than now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Right?  You and I are cool with that because we are the techies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  I hope one of our sociologist gurus will speculate on where it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  all leads.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see it as a problem.  A palm device is cheaper than a PC, and both 
<BR>
will continue to get cheaper and cheaper.  In fact, a 166 mhz Pentium 
<BR>
machine is now down to where just about anybody who is not homeless could 
<BR>
afford one if they wanted to.
<BR>
<P>IMO, the reason for the &quot;divide&quot; is not so much cost as priority.  *All* of 
<BR>
my friends could afford PC's and palm pilots (and believe me, I've got some 
<BR>
friends in low places).  About half of them have no computer at all.  Not 
<BR>
because they can't afford it, but because they just don't want one.  Some 
<BR>
folks just don't care about accessing information.  And when you take away 
<BR>
the information accessing function of a PC, it really is a pretty sorry 
<BR>
device to spend a bunch of money on.  Sure you can play games, watch movies, 
<BR>
listen to music and talk to friends on it, but not nearly as well as you can 
<BR>
do those things with a Playstation, a DVD player, a CD player and a 
<BR>
telephone (and *all* my friends have those things).
<BR>
<P>When PC's and handhelds have a &quot;killer app&quot; that will even make people who 
<BR>
are not enthusiastic about accessing information say &quot;Hey, I've gotta get 
<BR>
one of those!&quot; then I think you will see a precipitous drop in the 
<BR>
percentage of tech have-nots.
