<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;However upon closer study, I noticed some things which made me more

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;skeptical.  His model often lags the actual stock price movements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The paper I cited (which I just emailed to you) has some statistical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tests that should not have this problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thanks, I also found the paper online at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://econ161.berkeley.edu/pdf_files/Fluctuate.pdf">http://econ161.berkeley.edu/pdf_files/Fluctuate.pdf</A>.  Again the authors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are able to show that much of the variability in stock prices over the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;longer term (10-20 years) is captured by this model.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However I feel that my complaint is still valid, that the model could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be fundamentally wrong and still show correlation to actual prices,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by implicitly and subtly including real prices in the calculation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Real prices affect dividend levels, and so a model which sets warranted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prices based on dividends may be expected to correlate with real prices,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;after some time lag.  Since real prices correlate with themselves over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the short term the result is that this kind of model can show correlation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even though it has no actual predictive value.
</EM><BR>
<P>The paper is taking an average of dividends over the previous forty years.
<BR>
So short term fluctuations shouldn't contribute much to the estimate.
<BR>
<P>I had a brief exchange with the author last week, and he admitted that the
<BR>
big weakness of the paper is that they model dividends as changeable but
<BR>
interest rates as fixed.  See footnote seven regarding what can happen
<BR>
when the interest rates are allowed to vary.
