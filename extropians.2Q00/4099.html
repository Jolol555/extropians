<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For the record, I am not anxiously looking forward to *that* level 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveillance.  It may or may not become ubiquitous.  But if it does, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinks the best defense will be to live a life that you would not be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;ashamed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to have broadcast to the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Ah, the call for uniformity and conformance to 'accepted' society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Not at all.  If it is a call to anything, it is a call to integrity, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; living the same life in private as you live in public.  This is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not a call to conformance to anything except your own professed world 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It is not even (necessarily) a call to legality.  If you are opposed to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; law of the land, you are free to engage in civil disobedience, so long 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (like the civil rights activists of the '60's) you are willing to &quot;lay 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the line&quot; for your convictions.  But, on the other hand, if you want to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the mask of Johnny Civic-Law-Abiding-Citizen in public and yet do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; deviant thing you want in private, you need to vote a vociferous &quot;no&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; transparency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There is absolutely nothing inconsistent with being a perfectly law abiding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;citizen and maintaining a private life. There are many personal habits 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quite legal but which are really nobody's business to know. Would you like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;world to know that you pick your nose and eat it? That you scratch your ass 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;smell your fingers?  How would you like the world to call you Booger for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rest of your life? How quickly will you stop doing that thing you find so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enjoyable then? Still think ubiquitous surveillance won't cause conformity? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would you like the world to be able to weigh in on what they think about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you raise your kids? How would you like everyone your kids grows up with to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that they wet the bed? How many pedophiles are going to stalk your kids by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spying on them with a waspcam? You can't reply &quot;we'll catch them, and that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deter them from doing so&quot;. That is an incredibly stupid and naive reply, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if you know anything about such people it is that they don't care about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;caught, they just HAVE to satisfy their urges.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have never said that transparency will be fun.  I have said that it is 
<BR>
coming whether we like it or not.  I have also said that, on the whole, it 
<BR>
will be beneficial to society.  No, I don't want you to see me doing 
<BR>
embarrassing things.  But if *everyone* is subject to the same degree of 
<BR>
intrusion, I will suffer it and I will not complain.
<BR>
<P>Similarly, I *hate* paying income taxes.  I bust my butt everyday for my 
<BR>
money, not Uncle Sam.  Every year I write a big fat check to the government 
<BR>
and I feel like I am being raped.  But I realize that everyone else is 
<BR>
getting raped as well, and at least my rapist uses the money to buy things 
<BR>
that benefit me, like highways, infrastructure and hundreds of thousands of 
<BR>
people with guns to protect my family and me from the likes of Saddam 
<BR>
Hussein.  Do I like it?  No.  Can I put up with it?  In light of all the 
<BR>
circumstances, yes.
<BR>
