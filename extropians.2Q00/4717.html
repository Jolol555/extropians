What I was objecting to is the tendency for list subscribers to
<BR>
insist on WHAT is or isn't Extropian.  I think many things ARE if they are 
<BR>
done with great skill.
<BR>
<P>It happens too often for my taste, people reminding others to &quot;be more
<BR>
Extropian&quot;. ugh.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P><P>I can see the valid points Brian Atkins is making and yet this matter should 
<BR>
not be turned into an ideological witch hunt! :)  I have not seen Robert 
<BR>
Owen post in a long time and remember how his &quot;extropian purity&quot; was 
<BR>
questioned.  I hope he was not offended and so simply left us.  I enjoyed 
<BR>
his posts a great deal.

The following sentences are from Extropian Principles Version 3.0: 
<BR>
&quot;Transhumanists take humanism further by challenging human limits by means 
<BR>
of science and technology combined with critical and creative thinking.&quot;...&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This document deliberately does not specify particular beliefs, 
<BR>
technologies, or conclusions.  &quot;The document doesn't offer a definition of 
<BR>
technology; therefore, it seems safe to assume that for the purpose of 
<BR>
interpreting the document the word is to be defined according to its 
<BR>
generally accepted definition.
<BR>
<P>The dictionary I have sitting here on the shelf behind my desk (Webster's 
<BR>
9th New Collegiate) offers a definition of technology which I think is 
<BR>
relevant to a recent post by Robert-Coyote which implies that the means used 
<BR>
to grow food crops should not be considered technology. Here's the 
<BR>
definition: technology: the totality of the means employed to provide 
<BR>
objects necessary for human sustenance and comfort.
<BR>
<P>So, Robert-Coyote, I'm wondering why you think that the means to grow food 
<BR>
in beach sand with no fossil fuel consumed and without adding shipped-in 
<BR>
fertilisers, does not qualify as technology?
<BR>

<P>Robert, this is what you get for trying to argue with a lawyer!! ;)

<BR>
simply To be blunt, I think there are a lot of people hanging out on the 
<BR>
list who really are not extropians. Which is fine, since everyone has to be 
<BR>
a newbie at some point and decide for themselves whether or not they really 
<BR>
are or not. But some people seem to be unable to realize the fact that they 
<BR>
are not really extropian at all. They rationalize to themselves that they 
<BR>
are, but in fact the choices they continually make in their lives lead more 
<BR>
down the path towards entropy. So they end up hanging around here, really 
<BR>
not adding much besides noise.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>This is an excellent point.  I am to an extent one of those people.  I 
<BR>
believe in God and the divinity of Christ, though I do not claim an 
<BR>
absolutely sure knowledge of my faith.  This is at odds with the humanism in 
<BR>
transhumanism and one of Max's extropian principles on rejection of the 
<BR>
supernatural.
<BR>
<P>You talk about people continually making choices in their lives that lead 
<BR>
them down the path of entropy.  I have done such by not eating and 
<BR>
exercising right on a consistent basis, reducing my odds of making it to the 
<BR>
singularity despite my relatively young age of thirty-three.
<BR>
<P>I have also failed in not having the level of education I should to really 
<BR>
take advantage of the social and economic opportunities in this expanding 
<BR>
world of ours.  When I attended college for two years my eyes were greatly 
<BR>
opened to the world and learned about cryonics and extropianism while 
<BR>
surfing the net on a school computer.  I had never before had access to the 
<BR>
net before that.
<BR>
<P>Despite my regular posts to Cryonet and here, I have yet to get life 
<BR>
insurance and sign up for a cryonics policy with Alcor.  I even reached out 
<BR>
to Rudi Hoffman but did not follow up after getting a packet from him.  In 
<BR>
my mind getting a cryonics policy I must do to show myself that I am serious 
<BR>
about these things.
<BR>
<P>As Charles Platt once pointed out on cryonet, some people who sign up for 
<BR>
cryonics are those who feel they did not get a fair shake in this world and 
<BR>
want a chance at a future where &quot;body and soul&quot; will be healed and nurtured, 
<BR>
unlike here.

<BR>
In my opinion if we don't reserve the noun Extropian for those who are full 
<BR>
fledged practitioners of the philosophy, then isn't that a bit of an insult 
<BR>
to those people?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>An interesting thought!  Should we have orthodox extropians, unorthodox and 
<BR>
reformed? lol  Brian, you should create a purity test for those who want to 
<BR>
see if they are truly an extropian(really)!  I could also see Anders or 
<BR>
Eliezer being able to do a good job at this.
<BR>
<P>I view myself as a &quot;quasi-extropian&quot; and ultimately simply a cryonicist.  I 
<BR>
like the non-doctrinaire approach of the cryonics folks.  They make room for 
<BR>
me to be myself but then they are more about freezing then philosophy.  I 
<BR>
realize obviously, that there is interlap in both groups.

<BR>
I cannot exclude a person because of one or more characteristics that are 
<BR>
not completely extropian. In fact, I welcome even the slightest chance of 
<BR>
extropy in a person and encourage that growth. Why not?
<BR>
<P>Perfection is not all that historical myths have built it up to be and 
<BR>
frequently welds into static holding patterns -- inertia.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I like the open armed view of Natasha.  Yes, there are extropians and then 
<BR>
those who hang with them who are not, but Natasha's approach will
<BR>
I think do the most good.  As far as I know, I am free to pay my money 
<BR>
anytime and join the Extropy Institute to formally become an Extropian! lol
<BR>
<P>I realize there is more to being an extropian then just a membership card!  
<BR>
This reminds me of talks in church about being a &quot;doer of the word and not a 
<BR>
hearer only.&quot;  Had Max organized the Extropian Institute after the New 
<BR>
Testament church model, Brian would probably be one of the ExI apostles! ;)  
<BR>
Especially considering what he shared about himself that is below...

Sure, I support ExI and Foresight, each has received $10k from me so far 
<BR>
with more coming soon I hope. I am now supporting Eliezer's AI/Singularity 
<BR>
research indefinitely. I spend most of my time researching investment 
<BR>
strategies and opportunities both in public and private companies. In my 
<BR>
previous life (1997/98) I founded and sold Hypermart.net, which helps small 
<BR>
businesses get started on the Web.
<BR>
<P>Since then I helped start an angel investing group in Atlanta that has 
<BR>
helped many startups here get help. I have many public and private 
<BR>
investments, and as these grow I intend to continue to (hopefully) divert 
<BR>
larger and larger quantities of cash to the above and other 
<BR>
extropian/singularitarian efforts. I will be 26 years old on Saturday. 
<BR>
Someday I may start another business if I become motivated enough, but for 
<BR>
now I am content to let my money work for me.  I will admit to periods of 
<BR>
laziness and general comfort-seeking. None of us are machines (in the 
<BR>
robotic sense), we can't just work constantly...But in general I think I am 
<BR>
improving, expanding, and challenging my limits while hopefully doing a 
<BR>
little bit to fight entropy.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Wow, you have really accomplished alot at a pretty young age.  I am happy to 
<BR>
see that you are being generous in helping transhumanistic efforts that need 
<BR>
it.  Especially on behalf of Eliezer's seed AI research goal.  You have 
<BR>
earned your bragging rights as an extropian, no question about that and have 
<BR>
set an example to follow.
<BR>
<P>I am simply glad that the ExI is openminded in letting folks like me come 
<BR>
onto the list and share and learn with others.  It has been a fascinating 
<BR>
experience for me.  I look forward to attending the next Extro(it would be 
<BR>
my first) and meeting all my extropian cyberspace friends.
