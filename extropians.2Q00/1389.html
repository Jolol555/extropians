<EM>&gt;So the swifter and more positive, radical, option is to declare &gt;yourself

<EM>&gt;post- or neohuman at the outset, act as though it were true, &gt;and wait for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the changes to happen all by themselves!

Oh! I'm a jupiter brain. This easter I'm going to act as if I was a~100 km 
<BR>
sphere of diamondoid quantum dot cellular automata, surrounded by a corona 
<BR>
of solar collectors and radiators and with a mental capacity a few billon 
<BR>
times the whole of humanity (it could have been more, but those posthuman 
<BR>
screensavers take a *lot* of memory, even when they are not running). I can 
<BR>
think billions of superhuman thoughts at once, weaving together strands of 
<BR>
ideas without the least risk of getting confused. I understand all of human 
<BR>
history andknowledge just as easily as a human could understand a simple 
<BR>
equation. Hmm, let's start with terraforming Sweden...
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I now declare myself posthuman! Presto-chango! Tah Dahh!  This is great!  I 
<BR>
really don't like taking the bus to work so now I can run there today at 
<BR>
speeds up to 120 mph and not even get tired!!  I could simply fly but I will 
<BR>
start out small.
<BR>
<P>With my 400 IQ (yes, off the charts!) and totally photographic memory I will 
<BR>
finally become an honor student!  I have an intellect now on par with the 
<BR>
genetically engineered superhumans of the Dan Simmons novel _Brain Child_ 
<BR>
which will make my life so much easier.  I can now speed-read through a book 
<BR>
and totally master the contents in that time!
<BR>
<P>I will octuple major in the following subjects, computer sci, business, 
<BR>
biology, history, physics, art, world literature and philosophy.  I am going 
<BR>
for a light courseload because I don't want to burden my posthuman self too 
<BR>
much and I will need time for an active social life.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I will just forget about college for awhile and start up my own 
<BR>
company that sells the brilliant computer software I can now write!  Within 
<BR>
a few years or less I will have a net worth in the billions of dollars and 
<BR>
can finally be extremely generous to all my favorite causes.
<BR>
<P>My &quot;nano touch&quot; makes me into a being of great power for good.  Like the 
<BR>
heroine of the &quot;Bohr Maker&quot; I can heal others and easily create what I need 
<BR>
to.  Brent and I can straighten out the world now!
<BR>
<P>I havn't looked in the mirror yet but I know that now I am incredibly 
<BR>
handsome!  Between my handsome chiseled features, muscular body and 
<BR>
overwhelming pheromones, I am going to have a hard time fending off all the 
<BR>
beautiful women!  I will have to decide on just one!  Of course, I will let 
<BR>
her in on our little secret too!
<BR>
<P>Anders, I realize I have been nowhere as ambitious as you, but I want to 
<BR>
still be relatively human.  I hope you will be willing to consult for less 
<BR>
developed posthumans in case we need it!  Wow, the things you learn about on 
<BR>
this list....
<BR>
<P>Is Sweden so inhospitable that it needs terraforming?  I thought they had an 
<BR>
earthlike climate there? lol!
<BR>
<P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John ;)
