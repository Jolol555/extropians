And a brain saturated with Hydergine or other glutamine cascade blockers, 
<BR>
and a body full of anti hypoxia agents, with a 911 autodialer on a cellphone 
<BR>
will have a higher chance of survival.

<EM> &gt; Notice that you will be very unlikely to

<P><P>Most people I know &quot;in the business&quot; would much rather get shot at than
<BR>
knifed.  Contrary to popular misconception, your average person on the
<BR>
street with an intent to kill is generally more dangerous with a  knife
<BR>
than a gun.  The factors are complicated, though.  It is considerably more
<BR>
difficult to use a gun competently than a knife, and statistical gun
<BR>
homicides are often competent &quot;good guys&quot;, like police.  While a
<BR>
competently used gun has a higher lethality than a competently used knife
<BR>
(statistical delta of about 10% IIRC), in practice a &quot;good guy&quot; has more
<BR>
to fear statistically from a knife than a gun because of the poor average
<BR>
gun competence of criminals (and the population in general), which causes
<BR>
the statistical lethality of a bad guy with a gun to drop below that of a
<BR>
bad guy with a knife.  Overall, your odds of surviving getting shot
<BR>
up in the U.S. are &gt;80% from all sources (good guys and bad guys).
<BR>
<P>I am not supporting or refuting anything, merely throwing more facts into
<BR>
the fray.  Personally, I would just as soon avoid getting shot *or*
<BR>
stabbed.
