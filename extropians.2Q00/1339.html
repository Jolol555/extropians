writes: &quot;Me too.  Most people aren't even aware that I used to be in the 
<BR>
military,
<BR>
&nbsp;nevermind that I have a whole &quot;redneck&quot; way of life that I support.  Since 
<BR>
people are much more likely to see me patronizing trendy, upscale  
<BR>
cosmopolitan establishments in various locales, they have are very hard time 
<BR>
imagining me bouncing through the mountains like a hillbilly or surveying the 
<BR>
range on horseback.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is mainly directed at James Rogers and Al Villalobos but others are 
<BR>
invited to join in.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see I have one of those areas of interests that don't fit the mundane 
<BR>
pattern also and it occurs to me that this is the place to look for some 
<BR>
advice and that you are the two to start with.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a small part Cherokee.  I was doing some reading of Tom Brown, Jr. 
<BR>
and realized that if an old time Indian walked into a forest with a modern 
<BR>
steel knife and nothing else he would be technologically advantaged.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I own a good folding hunting knife and after studying the situation for a 
<BR>
while I realised that I seriously lack one thing that Indian would need.  
<BR>
Sitting aside my lack of practice of my skills; I have no idea what kind of 
<BR>
vegetation they used to tie things together.  The rawhide I know about but 
<BR>
the vegetation completely stops me.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also setting aside those funny weeds that would get me arrested do any of 
<BR>
you know what those Indians used for twine?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some one said they took any sort of tall weed that was handy, stripped it 
<BR>
and used it.  Is this true?
<BR>
Thank you
