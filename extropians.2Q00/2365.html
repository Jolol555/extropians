Dear Max and Nancy,
<BR>
I've been using supplements to gain youth. I'm 40 and I want to live a
<BR>
very long time because there's so much I've missed. I saw you on the
<BR>
videotape Future Fantastic with Gillian Andersen. Do you know how I can
<BR>
1. Live longer.
<BR>
2. Stop drinking alcohol.
<BR>
3. Stop smoking cigarettes.
<BR>
4. Find out more about Nutraceutics Pro hGH symbiotropin.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Ed,
<BR>
<P>You sure don't ask for much from them (you remind me of someone I know...myself maybe? lol)!!  Really Ed, just check out their individual websites and you will find PLENTY of great information of exercise, diet and life-extension!  I'm sure list members here can recommend some good books for you on the subjects.
<BR>
<P>I think one key way to once and for all quit drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes, is to make not just an intellectual, but an emotional decision to quit.  Connect your intellect with your heart, and have a support group in place that you are regularly accountable to.    
<BR>
<P>I didn't even realize Max and Natasha had been in the Future Fantastic video with Gillian Anderson.  Your post is going to cost me money now, as I am going to have to order a copy off the net!
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
