<P><EM>&gt; One comedian had the best idea I have ever heard. Make inmates peddle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bikes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all day and night to provide electricity for the whole nation. No one will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ever want to go back after ten years of that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eh. I like it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, hard labor is not a bad alternative for this purpose. If the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choice is between stocking shelves at the grocery store or breaking rocks in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prison, the guy who doesn't want to bother working has a clear incentive not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to become a criminal. I think you'd still want shorter sentences that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have now -- maybe 4-6 months of labor instead of a year of current-style
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jail.

Yeah but that's not the same. For one thing the bike/electricity idea serves 
<BR>
to solve TWO problems at once,  Greenie conservationists AND Law and Order 
<BR>
Goons will like it. Criminals will be put to a higher purpose, instead of 
<BR>
making things, they'll be like little power supplies....
<BR>
Second, hard labor isn't new, the bike idea is.
