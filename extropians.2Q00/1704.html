<P>
ok, sure, let's bring back Mannicheaism.  i'm up for dualism in May.
<BR>
<P>i will admit that i am not a full atheist, nor am i a full theist.  
<BR>
unfortunately, i have perhaps the most inconsistent set of beliefs possible. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not only am i a theist, but i am a christian, jew, muslim, buddhist, 
<BR>
agnostic, and atheist.  i interpret the universe aesthetically, using what 
<BR>
little scientific background i have sparingly.  i am indecisive and unable 
<BR>
to simply deny any of these faiths.  furthermore, it is not even a straight 
<BR>
shot for me - i could care less about mormonism, and mainline protestant 
<BR>
christianity really vexes me, but mostly due to the people who practice it 
<BR>
(and the total reliance on the bible doctrine, etc...).
<BR>
<P>i guess i envy rationalists in a way and find it confusing how they can deny 
<BR>
a great deal of human experience through logic.
<BR>
<P>so i am an ammateur (i don't code, i'm not a mathematician), but please do 
<BR>
not relegate me to some extropian/transhumanist stereotype (if indeed you 
<BR>
were doing so...if not, i apologize for making such an accusation).
<BR>
<P>transhumanis(m)(t) is an interesting word.  what exactly does it mean?  
<BR>
trans - across, beyond, through - humanis(m)(t) - well, that which is human? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;i mean, the word had a different meaning in the renaissance, but what did 
<BR>
those people know?
<BR>
<P>if we are to transcend humanity, then we must also go beyond on our own 
<BR>
minds and methods of thought.  &gt;&gt; ok, that is a very profound (bad word) 
<BR>
statement, but i cannot possibly be the first one to have pausited thus.
<BR>
<P>i understand that humanity has never fully embraced logic, and i also 
<BR>
believe that logic, if somehow it is infused as a guide into a great portion 
<BR>
of humanity in the future (political leaders, bussiness people, techies), 
<BR>
could be a wonderful tool.  but i am talking hypothetically about the far 
<BR>
future when i ask whether or not extropianism allows for the transcendence 
<BR>
of logic itself.  i know it is impossible to imagine/conceive of such a 
<BR>
thought process...but that's the whole point ;-)~
<BR>
<P>ok, more than enough said.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; out of curiosity, and i do apologize for the brevity of this message, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; extropianism allow for the human mind to evolve beyond 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;logic/rationalism?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My experience is that most people who say things like that aren't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interested in something &quot;better&quot; than rationalism--they're interested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in resurrecting some old dead theology that's been a proven failure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for centuries and dressing it in new clothes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Certainly the existing specific methods of logic and science, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;specific results of them can be improved upon; but that in itself is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rational--a rational being is simply one that seeks truth.  Reality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exists regardless of our actions or desires.  A rational being is one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whose actions are most compatible with its present understanding of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that reality.  That understanding can grow and change; but reality is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;still there, and commitment to it, rather than to any action clearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in conflict with it, will always be &quot;rational&quot;, and will always be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;superior to any alternative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
