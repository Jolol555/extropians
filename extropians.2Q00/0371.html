<EM>&gt; Mike, you can't imagine how wildly weird this sort of thing sounds in Oz.

<EM>&gt; How pathologically dangerous the society must have become to permit a

<EM>&gt; rational man like yourself to regard such fears as natural and attitudes as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; righteous. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I am actually somewhat puzzled by this response.  Do you not advocate a
<BR>
culture with a strong belief in a right of self-defense?  Considering, that
<BR>
violent crime rates in most European countries exceed those of the United
<BR>
States (with the narrow exception of homicide), it would seem that these
<BR>
issues need to be taken into consideration the more seriously.  Fact
<BR>
is, I am statistically much safer where I live in the U.S. than most
<BR>
places in Europe.  (I don't know about Australia specifically, but I have
<BR>
believe it is similar to Europe).
<BR>
<P>Consider a few things:
<BR>
<P>1)  In many U.S. locales, &quot;taking out the trash&quot; is encouraged as long as
<BR>
you operate within very strict guidelines.  These incidents (a few
<BR>
thousand a year) are included in U.S. homicide statistics even though no
<BR>
crime has been commited.
<BR>
<P>2)  According to the Sheriff where I live, every self-defense killing has
<BR>
a measurable statistical impact on the violent crime rate in the county,
<BR>
since the number of habitual violent criminals is very small with
<BR>
respect to the total population.  One self-defense shooting can reduce the
<BR>
number of violent crimes substantially, since many of these
<BR>
violent criminals are responsible for dozens of serious crimes on an
<BR>
annual basis.
<BR>
<P>3)  The vast majority of society in the U.S. enjoys an effective murder
<BR>
rate at or below that of most of Europe, most notably in areas that
<BR>
encourage &quot;taking out the trash&quot;.  Distribution tends to be very uneven,
<BR>
with a few geographically small locales contributing to the vast majority
<BR>
of the statistics.
<BR>
<P><P>I actually think that self-defense shootings have a bigger impact on
<BR>
violent crime rates than most government crime programs.  Having an
<BR>
accurate and rapid means of selecting out the pathological elements of a
<BR>
society appear to have a very beneficial effect where allowed.  It is
<BR>
difficult to ignore that the very locales in the U.S. where self-defense
<BR>
is not encouraged are the same locales that contribute to most of the
<BR>
violent crime statistics.
