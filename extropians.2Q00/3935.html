Ok. Little space are merely subsets of bigger spaces. Now, does anyone feel we might (in the distant future) make use of this; or is it just Einstein's poetics?

<P>In a message dated Sun, 28 May 2000  4:03:16 AM Eastern Daylight Time, &quot;<A HREF="mailto:scerir@libero.it?Subject=Re:%20many%20spaces%20interpretation&In-Reply-To=&lt;5a.5b8e1dd.2662c2ed@aol.com&gt;">scerir@libero.it</A>&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:scerir@libero.it?Subject=Re:%20many%20spaces%20interpretation&In-Reply-To=&lt;5a.5b8e1dd.2662c2ed@aol.com&gt;">scerir@libero.it</A>&gt; writes:

<P>&lt;&lt; &quot;When a smaller box s is situated, relatively at rest, inside the hollow
<BR>
space of a larger box S, then the hollow space of s is a part of the hollow
<BR>
space of S, and the same &quot;space&quot;, which contains both of them, belongs to
<BR>
each of the boxes. When s is in motion with respect to S, however, the
<BR>
concept is less simple. One is then inclined to think that s encloses always
<BR>
the same space, but a variable part of the space S. It then becomes
<BR>
necessary to apportion to each box its particular space, not thought of as
<BR>
bounded, and to assume that these two spaces are in motion with respect to
<BR>
each other. Before one has become aware of this complication, space appears
<BR>
as an unbounded medium or container in which material objects swim around.
<BR>
But it must now be remembered that there is an INFINITE NUMBER OF SPACES,
<BR>
which are in motion with respect to each other. The concept of space as
<BR>
something existing objectively and INDEPENDENT OF THINGS belongs to
<BR>
pre-scientific thought, but not so the idea of the existence of an INFINITE
<BR>
NUMBER OF SPACES in motion relatively to each other. This latter idea is
<BR>
indeed logically unavoidable, but is FAR FROM HAVING PLAYED A CONSIDERABLE
<BR>
ROLE even in scientific thought.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Science-fiction? Mach¹s radical geometro-dynamics? D. Hilbert¹s hypothesis?
<BR>
No, I was quoting Einstein, of course.
<BR>
But he did not make use of that radical concept when he developed the s.c.
<BR>
EPR argument (entangled particles, quantum measurement, spooky waves, faster
<BR>
than light messages, etc.).
<BR>
The poet (sometimes) falls asleep.
