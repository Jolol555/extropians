<EM>&gt;From: &quot;E. Shaun Russell&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:e_shaun@uniserve.com?Subject=Re:%20Working%20Within%20the%20System&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000429180834.48458.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">e_shaun@uniserve.com</A>&gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;While watching the news of the forced split of Microsoft last night, I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;again witness to the admirable but infuriating assertion by Bill Gates that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he was confident that &quot;...justice would be served in the end.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Unfortunately, I don't believe it.  What I can't understand is why such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;driven, high profile and all-around successful people choose to work within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a system which frequently works against them.  MS has done far more for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government (and indeed, the public as a whole) than the government has done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As one who deeply respects Gates and Microsoft, I want MS to resume as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has for the last decade: innovative, growing and successful; working within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a system which has none of those facets makes it hard for me to see how it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can be done.
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't you worry for MS.  They're going to come out of this smelling like a 
<BR>
rose.  The break up (if it ever happens) may turn out to be the best thing 
<BR>
that could happen for them.  Hint: If you were ever waiting for a good 
<BR>
opportunity to buy MS stock at a reasonable price, stop waiting and start 
<BR>
buying.
