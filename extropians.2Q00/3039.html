Because this is a philosophy mailing list, and ot one that has to be peer reviewed by scientists, let us make this conjecture: The Neuro-Matrix may exist in quantum or cosmological eigenstates. What has that to do with phantom-limb pain? Shit, I dunno, but it beats the heck out of saying death is eternal.  I wonder if there is a basis for automatic data-gathering and storage, and pre-suposing that; what that Thing may be?  Maybe in the Year Trillion, some MIND will decide to play back a Sasha, or a Robert v 1.0.1.1.1. ? It would make a nice reunion. Meanwhile peeps can still work on the more practical Life-Extension Medical &amp; UpLoading stuff. Welcome to the 'Neuro-Matrix Neo..'

I had discusssed the problem of whether it will be feasible to know
<BR>
the difference between A(recreated)-humans vs. and the decorporealized
<BR>
originals.

<EM>&gt;&gt; Melzack's Neuromatrix theory of self seems to adequately explain this point.

I didn't understand the reference, so I went looking:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; { Melzack's neuromatrix theory of phantom limb[1] &gt;&gt;claims that body experience
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; is genetic; he says, for example, that 'the neural &gt;&gt;network that underlies the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; experience of one's physical self is genetically &gt;&gt;determined'. This assertion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; is based upon two studies carried out 30 years ago[2-&gt;&gt;4 ]which claim 'that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; substantial number of children who are born without &gt;&gt;all or part of a limb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; feel a valid phantom of the missing part'. Close &gt;&gt;scrutiny reveals that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; these studies have methodological shortcomings. }&lt;&lt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;[1] Melzack, R. (1990) Trends Neurosci. 13, 88-92.

</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I must admit I still don't really see the connection.  &gt;Perhaps there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something I'm missing about the neuromatrix theory.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you are suggesting that an A-human cannot &gt;effectively be the original,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because there is no underlying genetic material, then &gt;I'd suggest you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;treading on thin ice.  The neural matrix (hardware) is &gt;so similar among most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;humans that we should understand the basic wiring and &gt;the effects of specific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;polymorphisms enough to be able to simulate much of it &gt;quite accurately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;within 15-20 years.  I'll take the Turing approach &gt;here that if looks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like a duck, walks like a duck and talks like a duck &gt;then from my perceptual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;standpoint, it *is* a duck.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In Sasha's case there would seem to be a fighting &gt;chance that there is enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;original material around to provide a plausibly &gt;realistic simulation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This may be aided by the fact that the individuals are &gt;still available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from which much of his personal genetic makeup could &gt;be determined.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In contrast millions of individuals die each year &gt;leaving behind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nothing more than fading memories in the people they &gt;knew.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I feel sad for their loss.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The cloning debates now will pale in comparison to the &gt;geno-reconstruction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;debates of the future.  [I'm not assuming that geno-&gt;reconstruction will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be able to reproduce the mind of an individual, but &gt;that geno-reconstruction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will allow a computer to produce a more accurate &gt;simulation if sufficient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;material regarding the person's life, opinions, &gt;thoughts, etc. is available.]
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So, for those individuals who can't quite convince &gt;their parents or loved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ones that lifespan extension, cryonics, etc is &quot;real&quot;, &gt;you can do an &quot;end-run&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around their lack of foresight.  Sit down with them &gt;with a video camera
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and get them to tell lots of stories about their &gt;life.  &quot;Interview&quot; them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for their not-yet-born family so they will be able &gt;to &quot;know&quot; who Great-Grandma
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or Great-Grandpa was.  Get your cells and those of &gt;more enlightened family
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;members frozen someplace (there are several &gt;organizations I believe that now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do this).  If you can, request or even covertly &gt;harvest some of their cells
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(e.g. offer to vacuum the house then get the contents &gt;of the bag frozen),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or clean off the individual's hairbrush....  Not &gt;guaranteed, but better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than nothing.  Best would be to get them to arrange to &gt;have a vial of blood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shipped to a cold-storage facility the next time they &gt;get a physical checkup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and blood is being taken for routine lab workups.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It is worth thinking about this as a &quot;group&quot; activity &gt;at Extro5.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Certainly a news-worthy and thought provoking activity &gt;to have hundreds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of individuals interacting with each other with a goal &gt;of providing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enough &quot;bits&quot; (that can be stored in multiple places) &gt;that they can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plausibly be recreated or even recorporealized from &gt;such information,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should an unforeseen or unavoidable accident occur.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I can see the list in 30 years -- &quot;Ok, will everybody &gt;please look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at the Burch v.14 recreation and see if his desire for &gt;fast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cars is tuned correctly?&quot;
