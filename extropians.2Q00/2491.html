<BR>
<EM>&gt; For a robot to make a measurement in a reversible and non-dissipative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manner is possible.  For it to reverse that measurement is also possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However for the reversal to work I believe it is necessary that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outside world must be in the same state that it was in at the end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the measurement.  This was one of the points Robin made in his paper.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the outside world is reversed when the robot is, as is possible if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the robot is interacting with a VR, then this condition will be met.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But if the outside world is the real world, then in general this condition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot be met.  Things will have changed in the interim and when you do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the reversal, the state of the measured system will not be the same as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it was when the initial measurement was completed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Therefore measurements can be reversed in the virtual world but not in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real world, and you thus have additional opportunities to save energy when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interacting with a virtual world over interacting with a physical one.
</EM><BR>
<P>A VR can never be the environment of anything in a thermodynamic sense. It
<BR>
can't even be the environment of a purely virtual device. All the bits in
<BR>
your robot are represented by real bits in a physical computer. So are all
<BR>
the bits representing the current state of the VR, and its past and future
<BR>
states. When you try to reverse the virtual operations of your simulated
<BR>
robot, it is this mass of physical bits that must be manipulated. In order
<BR>
to return the VR world to a previous state, you have to return some pattern
<BR>
of bits in the physical machine back to a previous state. At that point you
<BR>
run into exactly the same constraints you would have if you weren't using a
<BR>
VR.
<BR>
<P>This is just a special case of a much more general (and obvious) rule: no
<BR>
form of software can ever perform a computation that could not, in
<BR>
principle, be done by the hardware it runs on.
