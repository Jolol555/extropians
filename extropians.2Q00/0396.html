<EM>&gt; &gt;Hal, I think Damien was referring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to notion that someone would *need* to defend themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;This highlights the difference in perspectives:  Most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Americans on this list are Libertarians; they look at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;gun &quot;problem&quot; in terms of an individuals need to protect him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;or herself from intruders.  The common perspective in the UK
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is to look at the effect of guns on society as a whole,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;without regard to the individual.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good post. Yes, this is about it. As I said to Hal off-list, what I found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weird is the basic notion that a civilised society can take it for granted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (apparently) that every household and member is in imminent danger of rape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and death. And that the preferred way to deal with such a perilous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situation is to threaten lethal-force mayhem back - even if it works, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if it's reached a kind of malign stand-off stability.
</EM><BR>
<P>I understand completely where you are coming from. I would love to live
<BR>
in a society where:
<BR>
<P>a) I need never worry that another individual would consider stealing
<BR>
from, raping, assaulting, or killing myself or others to be reasonable
<BR>
activities to fill one's afternoon or evening. Sadly, there is nowhere
<BR>
on earth where such societies exist.
<BR>
<P>b) I need never worry that elected politicians or career bureaucrats
<BR>
would value their own power and self-aggrandizement over the rights of
<BR>
any individual citizen, or group of citizens, where I would never need
<BR>
fear that the majority of voters would make dumb decisions or act in
<BR>
fear, hate, or a panic to confiscate the life, property, and liberty of
<BR>
me and mine. Sadly there is no society on earth where this state exists.
<BR>
<P>What I do know is that freedom is not free. It costs, both in the blood,
<BR>
sweat, tears and pocketbooks of many Americans in dealing with foreign
<BR>
tyrants, but in the added risks to everyday life that must be assumed if
<BR>
the individual is to have any say in what risks they as individuals are
<BR>
willing to accept, and what ones they are free to take personal action
<BR>
in managing or eliminating.
<BR>
<P>It seems from the mortality rates of the past century, that the actual
<BR>
risk to life and limb is much higher in gun control societies,
<BR>
specifically because such societies tend to engage in widespread warfare
<BR>
and genocide far more frequently, so while liberty oriented societies
<BR>
maintain a constant minor level of violence, the controlling, socialist
<BR>
societies tend to have relative peace for periods, accentuated with
<BR>
short periods of great violence. 
<BR>
<P>What does this tendency impart about the fears of people like Bill Joy
<BR>
for the next century, if he is arguing for more government control of
<BR>
technologies?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do realise the general availability of firearms in the USA, which clearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't be recalled this far down the track for all kinds of reasons historic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and ideological, provides the basis for such a tragic Mutual Assured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Destruction way of life (even if this is usually only droning away in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; background outside the urban blights).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I gather that in Oz some crimes of violence have increased after gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recall, but as far as I know there's less chance of death or major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impairment when you're hit by a heavy stick or even a knife in a brawl or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robbery. I have no figures on this, so maybe it's my wishful thinking.

<P>Source: Gary Kleck, Targeting Guns: Firearms and Their Control, Walter
<BR>
de 
<BR>
Gruyter, Inc., New York, 1997. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A National Institute of Justice publication, Firearms and Violence, 
<BR>
cites Kleck stating, &quot;victims were less likely to report being injured
<BR>
than
<BR>
those who either defended themselves by other means or took no self-
<BR>
protective measures at all. Thus, while 33 percent of all surviving
<BR>
robbery 
<BR>
victims were injured, only 25 percent of those who offered no resistance 
<BR>
and 17 percent of those who defended themselves with guns were injured.
<BR>
For 
<BR>
surviving assault victims, the corresponding injury rates were,
<BR>
respectively,
<BR>
30 percent, 27 percent, and 12 percent.&quot; (Many of the conclusions
<BR>
mentioned 
<BR>
in Firearms and Violence are rebutted elsewhere in GunCite and those
<BR>
that 
<BR>
aren't will be addressed in the near future.) 
<BR>
<P>How often do gun owners accidently shoot a family member in the course
<BR>
of 
<BR>
defensive gun use? Again in Targeting Guns, after reviewing studies,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleck says this kind of accidental shooting is extremely rare. He 
<BR>
estimates that less than 2% of fatal gun accidents occur during
<BR>
defensive 
<BR>
gun use. With approximately 1,500 fatal gun accidents annually, that
<BR>
would 
<BR>
amount to 30 per year. With over 2 million defensive gun uses annually,
<BR>
the 
<BR>
odds of a defensive gun use resulting in a fatal gun accident would be 
<BR>
less than 1 in 65,000. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, using the data from above, Kleck estimated that at most 1% of 
<BR>
gun defenders lost a gun to the criminal. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If defensive gun use is common then many criminals should certainly 
<BR>
have encountered armed resistance. Professors James D. Wright and Peter
<BR>
Rossi
<BR>
surveyed 2,000 felons incarcerated in state prisons across the United 
<BR>
States. Wright and Rossi reported that 34% of the felons said they
<BR>
personally 
<BR>
had been &quot;scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim&quot;; 
<BR>
69% said that they knew at least one other criminal who had also; 34%
<BR>
said 
<BR>
that when thinking about committing a crime they either &quot;often&quot; or
<BR>
&quot;regularly&quot;
<BR>
worried that they &quot;[m]ight get shot at by the victim&quot;; and 57% agreed
<BR>
with the
<BR>
statement, &quot;Most criminals are more worried about meeting an armed
<BR>
victim 
<BR>
than they are about running into the police.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&lt;End citation&gt;
<BR>
<P>Another interesting page is:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcdgaga.html">http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcdgaga.html</A>
<BR>
which refutes the myth that gun owners are '43 times more likely to be
<BR>
killed.' (what Kleck calls a 'nonsense ratio').
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The points added by James and John (this is getting very Biblical,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appropriately I suppose) don't persuade me, but I do see their case. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; principle, I'm aghast at the notion of vigilantes blowing away `trash'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (partly because American and Australian whites both seem to have logged up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite a hearty score in dead black `trash' over the years). But I read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough Heinlein in adolescence to approve secretly of the idea of citizens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assembled deciding that enough's enough and chucking sociopaths out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; airlock. And when I see egregious criminal scumbags roaming free, I wish I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could reach for a gun and blow the fuckers away. And that's one reason why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm very, very glad that I *can't* reach for a gun, in Oz, and by and large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that neither will the scumbag...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm out of this discussion now. If I find any stats on the NRA claims, I'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pass them along.
</EM><BR>
<P>Outside of the big cities, it is much the same here in the US. Vermont
<BR>
and NH's homicide rates match that of Britain, despite having open
<BR>
borders with states that have much higher crime rates and greater gun
<BR>
control laws...You might be led to ask why then, do I own guns when I
<BR>
live in such a peaceful area? a) because I can (ain't freedom great?),
<BR>
and b) freedom also means I shouldn't have to limit where I can travel
<BR>
just because there is crime there.
<BR>
<P>While the present media and liberal hysteria against guns worries me, I
<BR>
do see hope. The US v. Emerson case is to hear final arguments at the
<BR>
beginning of June at the Appeals Court of the 5th Circuit.
<BR>
Constitutional handicappers seem to be weighing in at at least two to
<BR>
one FOR the individual rights interpretation, and the quantity of
<BR>
breifs, including amicus curea breifs, seem to fall along this line as
<BR>
well. If we win this level, it should go to the Supreme Court (assuming
<BR>
that Reno, et al will try to appeal it and expedite the case before Gore
<BR>
loses and Clinton leaves office to get indicted at the end of his term
<BR>
in January.)
<BR>
<P>In the interests of amicus on the list, I would suggest that the list
<BR>
accept an agreement that the issue be laid aside at least until the 5th
<BR>
Circuit Court of Appeals hears final arguments and issues a ruling. It
<BR>
seems likely that C-SPAN will be providing coverage of the case at that
<BR>
time, so stay tuned.
