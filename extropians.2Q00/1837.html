<EM>&gt; However, there are very competent bodies who set out open industry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standards for software, hardware and the Internet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Open standards are primarily a marketing tool used by companies that have
<BR>
tiny market shares to persuade people to buy their products. Sometimes such
<BR>
a &quot;standard&quot; will actually become so commonly used as to become the normal
<BR>
way of doing things (i.e. HTML), but it is just as common for a completely
<BR>
proprietary standard produced by a big company to end up in that role (i.e.
<BR>
ODBC).
<BR>
<P>Just because a bunch of companies get together and issue a 'standard' does
<BR>
not mean that their work should have any special protections, or that
<BR>
everyone should immediately adopt it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And you know what? I'm not even suggesting Microsoft has to use them!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They are more than welcome to go off and use their own proprietary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standards instead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What I *really* object to is the way they take the standards, claim they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are using them, and then produce their own broken implementation, add
</EM><BR>
their
<BR>
<EM>&gt; own undocumented features, and use their position to make sure those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes get spread and used, causing incompatibilities everywhere.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you think this is some special sin of Microsoft's, you need to look
<BR>
around more often.
<BR>
<P>Portability standards, like Java, HTML or POSIX, are essentially marketing
<BR>
efforts launched by coalitions of companies who do not have enough market
<BR>
share to be viable competitors by themselves. Such standards are inherently
<BR>
unstable, in that it is in the best interests of any vendor to do things
<BR>
that disrupt the standard. Generally every vendor who supports the standard
<BR>
will also new features in an effort to win market share. At the same time,
<BR>
companies with established technologies of their own will try to co-opt or
<BR>
undermine the standard through tactics like false adoption, nonstandard
<BR>
implementation and back-room bullying. This is all a normal part of life in
<BR>
the business world, and MS isn't any worse about it than anyone else in the
<BR>
industry.
<BR>
<P>Interoperability standards, like TCP and HTTP, are another matter. Because
<BR>
their purpose is to allow products from different vendors to work together,
<BR>
it is usually in everyone's best interests to fully codify and support them.
<BR>
No one has much to gain from adding proprietary features, or trying to
<BR>
sabotage someone else's implementation, so it doesn't happen very often. In
<BR>
this field Microsoft has actually done an outstanding job - in less than a
<BR>
decade they moved from a very primitive OS based entirely on proprietary
<BR>
software to a competitive product that supports every significant
<BR>
interoperability standard I've ever heard of (and a lot of insignificant
<BR>
ones as well).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The modern world is *utterly dependent* on its IT infrastructure. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; days when a few commercial entities could be entrusted with it should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long past.
</EM><BR>
<P>No one is *entrusted* with anything in a free market. Commercial entities
<BR>
can only control a vital technology if they are actually doing a decent job
<BR>
of managing it, because the moment they begin making mistakes they create an
<BR>
opportunity for rivals to make big money by fixing things. The whole system
<BR>
is self-correcting (and, indeed, self-improving), in a way that no
<BR>
government has ever achieved.
<BR>
<P>Besides, there is no alternative. The only way to prevent corporations from
<BR>
controlling the technologies they create is to resort to government
<BR>
confiscation, and we've already seen that that approach is far worse.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have no objection to Microsoft writing and selling their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software, and making a hell a lot of money out of it. But they don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have any right to make things difficult for those (who are *not*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competitors of theirs) trying to ensure people have the freedom to use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whichever tools they wish to make use of the infrastructure, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever reason
</EM><BR>
<P>That sounds very noble and high-minded, but in practice what you want is for
<BR>
MS to be forbidden from competing with anyone who chooses to wrap themselves
<BR>
in the 'open standards' flag. That is both nonsensical and harmful to
<BR>
consumers. Do you really think that Sun is pushing Java out of the goodness
<BR>
of their hearts? Of course not. Anything that any company does is ultimately
<BR>
intended to make money. Standards efforts are simply another tool companies
<BR>
use to compete with one another, and any attempt by the government to
<BR>
dictate that some particular standard should win simply replaces market
<BR>
competition with a contest of political influence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (such as because Microsoft's are buggy and insecure).
</EM><BR>
<P>Ten years ago this remark would have been on target. Five years ago the
<BR>
matter would have been arguable. Today it is simply ignorant prejudice.
<BR>
Microsoft's current performance in both these areas is in the top 25% of the
<BR>
industry, and still improving at a steady rate. They aren't the best in the
<BR>
world, but they are much better than average, and unless the Unix vendors
<BR>
get their collective act together they *will* be the best in another five
<BR>
years or so.
<BR>
<P>Which just illustrates once again why I think the antitrust case is such a
<BR>
bad idea.
