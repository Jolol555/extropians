<EM>&gt; with Cindy Crawford, I will testify to anything.  Nothing I say can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trusted.  You must be mistaken.  I wasn't there.  I didn't see it.  I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know anything.  I can't remember.  Spike who?

<P>Jeff you crack me up bud.  {8^D  Just so you feel better, I
<BR>
did actually blow that stop sign just to impress you.  I dont
<BR>
know if you noticed I went around the long way intentionally
<BR>
because I knew of a stop sign that one could blow with impunity.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, regarding the test case.  If the cities that get
<BR>
traffic cams do not lower their penalty structure, then
<BR>
I will be forced to change my views on the transparent
<BR>
society.  I wonder how we could get aholt of the data?
<BR>
Does anyone here live in or know someone who lives in
<BR>
a city that has gotten traffic cams in the recent past?  spike
