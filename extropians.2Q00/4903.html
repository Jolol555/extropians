<P>
I know there's already been a good deal of discussion on this thread and what 
<BR>
I have to say here will mostly be redundant of what others have said, but 
<BR>
here's my two cents:
<BR>
<P>As Max pointed out and as I think the Extropian Principles make very clear, 
<BR>
the &quot;official&quot; statement of the principles and values that define the concept 
<BR>
of &quot;extropianism&quot; are intended to be just that, i.e. a definition of a set of 
<BR>
congruent insights and ideals, and not a prescription for any particular 
<BR>
lifestyle or a specific formula for success in life.  In fact, with the 
<BR>
fundamental importance those principals and values place on diversity and 
<BR>
self-direction as both a good in themselves and as an important safeguard 
<BR>
against tyranny and the infertility of &quot;memetic monoculture&quot;, I would expect 
<BR>
a healthy extropian community to contain a very wide diversity of lifestyles, 
<BR>
personality types, private ambitions and public institutions.
<BR>
<P>With that important introduction, I think it's been correctly pointed out 
<BR>
that some things are clearly NOT extropian: You can't be an &quot;extropian 
<BR>
fascist&quot; or an &quot;extropian luddite&quot;.  In that regard, I think it will always 
<BR>
be easier to say what isn't extropian than what is, especially since, as 
<BR>
&quot;dynamists&quot;, we encourage and enjoy innovation: The more successful we are in 
<BR>
implementing our principles and ideals, the more we'll find new expressions 
<BR>
of those ideals in surprising and unexpected ways.
<BR>
<P>Over the years we've seen many distinct expressions of extropianism.  We've 
<BR>
seen that some people are more interested in &quot;inner development&quot;, while 
<BR>
others are drawn to the social implications of our values.  Some people are 
<BR>
drawn to the technological instrumentalities of our growth and change, while 
<BR>
others are preoccupied with the abstract refinement of the goals we seek.  
<BR>
It's a testimony to the core value of our values, so to speak, that we have 
<BR>
seen such a growth in diversity in the legitimate expression of our ideals.
