<EM>&gt; &gt; I would agree that it would be the right thing to do to try to evade the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; strictures of a malevolent government (tyrannical or otherwise), but since I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do not have that opinion of my government, I am content to cooperate with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you cooperate with the present US Government to a greater extent than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to protect your own safety (i.e. paying to taxes to stay out of jail is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, but buying T-Bills is not), you are morally complicit in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atrocities committed by that government.  One MILLION Americans are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rotting in prison having harmed no person or property; armed agents of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the government routinely confiscate billions of dollars worth of property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without trial or even accusation; thousands of immigrants are collected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and returned to more oppressive governments; if that's not tyrrany, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what is?
</EM><BR>
<P>He doesn't think its tyranny only because they aren't shooting people in the
<BR>
streets (oops, they do that indirectly by disarming law abiding people and not
<BR>
prosecuting gun carrying criminals), or killing hundreds of thousands in
<BR>
concentration camps (oops, its estimated that 15% of the prison population in the
<BR>
US is or will become HIV positive during their period of incarceration, at a
<BR>
minimum, thats 300,000 people killed with a death sentence by AIDS, far in excess
<BR>
of any punishment justified by the crimes they are convicted of), or that they
<BR>
don't spy on everything that a person is browsing on their computer (oops, look up
<BR>
Van Eyck (sp?) Transmissions, that DARPA and the NSA have systems for snooping on
<BR>
what you are viewing on your computer monitor (thus getting around whatever packet
<BR>
encryption you are using on the network), and the NSA has a coop agreement with
<BR>
MI6 to spy on us in exchange for the NSA spying on british people...)
<BR>
<P>Nope, so long as the feds keep Lon Horiuchi caged up and not blowing innocent
<BR>
Americans' brains out on national TV, Zero is quite content with our
<BR>
government....
