<P>
I hope transhumanists are judged more on what they do than what they
<BR>
merely claim to be. 
<BR>
<P>We all encounter people who make us think &quot;What an idiot!&quot; or similar
<BR>
uncharitable things, sometimes for good reason, sometimes not. But
<BR>
thinking that somebody is a fool or unethical does not mean one should
<BR>
immediately blurt it out. There is both a chance of being mistaken and
<BR>
of simply having a highly subjective opinion about some emotionally
<BR>
charged issue. It is much better to focus on the issues rather than
<BR>
the people, because they can be clarified, argued and maybe understood
<BR>
to a much greater extent. 
<BR>
<P>Are we not striving to become more rational, more transhuman? 
<BR>
<P>That doesn't mean it is easy to stay detached after somebody called
<BR>
you a dendrophagous hynerian or whatever, and occasional emotional
<BR>
outbursts definitely should be forgiven. It is the consistent personal
<BR>
attacks, bad debate tactics, spurious claims and claiming to be great
<BR>
but not providing a shred of evidence of actually being able to do or
<BR>
be something great and respectable that really make the credibility of
<BR>
the people doing it suffer. Of course, given the nature of
<BR>
incompetence most of the people who do this does not realise what they
<BR>
are doing but think they are enlightened and rational and their
<BR>
detractors merely acting out scripts of cultism or whatever. 
<BR>
<P>All this is obvious, has said before and is not really
<BR>
interesting. But as I pointed out in the PR thread, we better get very
<BR>
good at it. Idiotic posts/posters should be responded to where
<BR>
appropriate - in an approproate manner.
