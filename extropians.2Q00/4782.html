<EM>&gt; &gt;Of course, I like a lot of the sentiment. Yet, it reeks of modernism;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;perpetual progress? more intelligence and wisdom? Perpetually overcoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;constraints on our progress, advancing without end? All very linear stuff;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as simple as A to B:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     A: Where you are now --------------&gt; B: Glorious Posthuman future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Emlyn: You've lost me here. How is &quot;perpetual progress&quot; a linear 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; progression from point A to point B? The whole idea of this principle is to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communicate the idea of a *process* of continual improvement, *not* the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reaching of some final endpoint of posthumanity, utopia, or whatever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Did anyone else misunderstand this? If so, I need to rewrite it to avoid 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that idea. However, I do think it should be clear as it stands.
</EM><BR>
<P>When I discuss transhumanism in Swedish, I tend to use the word
<BR>
&quot;utveckling&quot; (literally translated it becomes &quot;out-unfolding&quot;), which
<BR>
has the meaning of development, evolution, progress, growth,
<BR>
generation etc. (you can see that Swedish lacks the synonyms of
<BR>
English :-). The nice thing is that it conjures up an image of not a
<BR>
linear progression, but rather something unfolding and developing into
<BR>
many directions at once. 
<BR>
<P>I think it is important to stress the divergent nature of
<BR>
transhumanism. One of the most common misconceptions about it both
<BR>
among outsiders and some transhumanists is that it has a clear 'plan'
<BR>
or 'goal' that everybody must strive for. It is rather pointing
<BR>
upwards, but not demanding that everybody rush off in the same way or
<BR>
using the same means.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Besides this misunderstanding, what exactly is your objection in calling it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;modernist&quot;. Modern as opposed to what? Is this a bad thing? If by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;modernist&quot; you simply meant a linear move from the present to a final 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point of perfection, then I've already shown that to be a misconception. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Did you mean something else?
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe this relates to the postmodern criticism of modernism (defined
<BR>
as the stream of thought initiated by the enlightenment)? Even if much
<BR>
of it is just a reflex attack against anything labelled as modernist
<BR>
(after all, postmodernism defines itself by being post modernism),
<BR>
there are some relevant criticisms of the bad sides of modernist
<BR>
thought and culture that are worth considering. 
<BR>
<P>In our local philosophical discussions we have discussed how to borrow
<BR>
the best parts of postmodernism and combine them with transhumanism,
<BR>
without losing the enlightnment push. As Waldemar began one of his
<BR>
essays: &quot;We have hi-jacked postmodernism!  Fly us to the Omega Point!&quot;
<BR>
:-)
