<P><EM>&gt; &gt; As it happens, this particular topic has been rather well researched. Mike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is exaggerating a bit, but it is certainly true that in the first half of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the 20th century American high schools taught many subjects that are now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; considered advanced college fare. My favorite example is the fact that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; material colleges now cover in three semesters of calculus used to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taught
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in high school as a matter of course. Much the same thing has happened in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all of the sciences, not to mention literature and foreign languages.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Now, obviously that doesn't mean that every citizen of the day was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; proficient in all of these skills. It does, however, make it clear just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; far our current system's standards have declined.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, maybe most people didn't actually understand all that calculus in high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; school. Perhaps its harder than once thought, and so has ended up in uni?
</EM><BR>
<P>I took calculus in high school. The only thing difficult about it was that it
<BR>
was a 1st period class, when my body much prefered to be in bed...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I'm assuming College is Uni; we do things differently down here).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup.

<EM>&gt; Emlyn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Isn't calculus that guy from Tintin comics?)
</EM><BR>
<P>No, he's the guy in the movie _Fletch Lives_, Calculus Jones (and his cousin
<BR>
Geometry Brown).
