<EM>&gt; &gt; Another thing they used to talk about was how stringent the vehicle inspection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; regs were over there. Billy-Bob normally couldn't drive his pickup truck over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there, as little things like rust were much more frowned upon over there.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes'n'no. You can drive a vehicle in any damn state you want, without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insurance ... if it's on private land. If you want to go on the public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highways, however, it has to be insured, pay road tax (which notionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goes into a fund for maintaining the highways), and have a Ministry of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Transport test certificate indicating that it passed inspection.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The goal of the MoT inspection is not, as is the case in Japan, to ensure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the vehicle matches the manufacturer's spec, but to ensure that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vehicle is *safe*.  This isn't simply for the owner, but for other road
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; users. Consider this a public good; do you really want to share the road
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with vehicles with lousy brakes, non-operational lights, bald tyres,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and defective bodywork that might drop off? (One would suspect that in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any libertarian state with private roads, the road-owners would end up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imposing similar conditions on people using them -- or higher tolls.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, clear operational problems are understood, I was under the impression they
<BR>
dinged people for many merely cosmetic reasons. Surface rust has nothing to do with
<BR>
operational performance, at least with cars here in the US, because salt is used so
<BR>
much in the winter on the roads, unless your car is plastic you will have a tough
<BR>
time not getting any rust after just a couple years.
