<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I've got quite a lot more ideas on this going round - but I'd quite like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;to hear everyone's opinions on what I've said so far.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm impressed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's a *lot* more to come. I'm trying to get this together into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; workable RPG, so I'm going to have to cover every inch of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; background. In about a month, when I'm less busy, I'll be able to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down to working on it a little more and probably put out a first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; version sometime in the summer. Still trying to work out a good set of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rules. I think this is going to be the game where I finally implement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'Jammy Action Tokens', which I once introduced to Vampire. The fortune
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; points in the B5 RPG came close, but I think this is what's needed :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If I had read your post before seeing the movie it would have made suspension
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of disbelief much easier and I'd have enjoyed the movie that much more.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; particularly like your take that the AI's are following Asimov's laws and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doing what they think we want them to.  I just could not buy into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; human-Duracel bit.  I can't see how we'd make more efficient batteries than,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; say, solar energy or even an army of cloned electric eels.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No way at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Personally, I think there were two major ickynesses to the film -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Morpheus' explanation of the AIs, and the existence of the Oracle.
</EM><BR>
<P>Morpheus' explaination might be looked at as a reflection of how well any opponent
<BR>
truly knows their enemy. Most conflict comes from misunderstanding, so it only
<BR>
follows that the resistance would have an imperfect understanding of their enemy,
<BR>
especially one so vast as the AI.
<BR>
<P>The existence of the Oracle could simply be a user interface for a freindly AI that
<BR>
has hacked the system to genetically engineer Neo. Remeber the warning about
<BR>
'indistinguisable from magic'.
<BR>
<P>The Oracle predicted Morpheus' death, which was predictable given his lack of
<BR>
understanding of the enemy. As Sun Tsu said, the path to victory is by knowing your
<BR>
enemy and knowing yourself. Neo attained a good degree of that understanding in the
<BR>
end, which is why he was able to win in the end.
