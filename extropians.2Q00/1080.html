<EM>&gt; &gt; On the other hand, criminal behavior does have an additional unique 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cost,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which is that it cuts one off from normal uncensored interaction with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; conscious beings.  One has to constantly monitor the image one is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; projecting, to make it correspond to something different from the real 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or face the consequences of being found out as a criminal.  This has a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; disasterous effect upon certain fundamental psychological and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; psychoepistemological needs.  After all, what do people put more effort 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; typically than their love lives?  For what are they more willing to take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; major risks - or even sacrifice their own lives - than for their loved 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ones?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is what keeps middle class people so effectively in line. Criminal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;type
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actions will not only alienate their wives and girlfriends.  But also their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;family, neighbors, and friends.  But this is not the case in the 'hood'.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guys in the hood have mothers who shriek &quot;My baby!  My baby!&quot;  when the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;court
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;punishes them form multiple murders.  And the worst gang banger always 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have at least one girl friend!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
But that's not exactly the same thing....  Gangs, whether your local barrio 
<BR>
punks or the BATF or the Catholic Church, get you to commit a crime as the 
<BR>
price of admission, and then sell you a phony philosophy to justify or - in 
<BR>
the case of Christianity, especially - offer absolution.  The gang tells the 
<BR>
member that his or her social/ethnic/economic status made him who he is, and 
<BR>
everything bad in his life is due to other bad people - who he has a perfect 
<BR>
right to kill or rip off.
<BR>
<P>The philosophy - whether church, gang or state - is always transparently 
<BR>
false to any intelligent truth seeker, but they usually get them young and 
<BR>
stupid.  Then you're locked into justifying yourself.  Which means you 
<BR>
commit more crimes to prove to yourself it's really ok.  And if you try to 
<BR>
leave, you find yourself sucked back in because you can't get real 
<BR>
visibility outside, as you can't show people who you really are - except 
<BR>
back in the gang.
<BR>
<P>The gang, like most marriages - which are usually based on mutually- 
<BR>
agreed-upon lieing - offers a pseudo-visibility which never fully satisfies, 
<BR>
but is all the gang member can morally afford - which is the bottom-line 
<BR>
tragedy.  When a person is denied the satisfaction of real crucial needs, 
<BR>
then he or she can be tempted into accepting phony substitutes, essentially 
<BR>
hypnotising himself into going along with the fantasy.  The problem is that 
<BR>
the need is never really satisfied by the phony substitute, and thus you can 
<BR>
never get enough of it - although people will not stop trying.
<BR>
<P>See Branden's &quot;The Psychology of Self-Esteem.&quot;  Or, the works of Wilhelm 
<BR>
Reich or the many prominent Neo-Reichien psychotherapists, such as Arthur 
<BR>
Janov.
