<EM>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, we have a tradition of booting the British out here, so our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sympathies tend to go to the 'underdogs'. After the rev war here, many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tories
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stayed. Some got picked on, sure, while others hightailed it for Canada and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sicced their lawyers to try to regain the property they had abandoned (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that didn't work, they instigated the War of 1812 (the 'British' troops were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mostly Canadians)). You might call Canada the North American equivalent of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Northern Ireland, and you've also got a put upon Catholic minority up there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm sure Canadians just love the Ulster Unionists...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As for myself, a Catholic Scottish American whose family got relocated to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nova
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Scotia from the Gordon's Highlands, I've got little or no sympathies for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; headaches the Protestant British have brought on themselves, while at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; time I have no sympathies for the marxist ideology of most IRA members.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Frankly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you deserve each other.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks a lot. It's good to know that you think I should be bombed by a bunch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of madmen because of something my countrymen did several hundred years ago.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, you're still benefitting from their crimes, right? That makes you an
<BR>
accessory after the fact. I'm sure if you went back to wherever you came from
<BR>
they'd sure stop bombing you, wouldn't they?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A lot of people seem to be under the misapprehension that the IRA are freedom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fighters struggling against the evil oppression of the British (English)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Empire.  They are not.  They (and the UVF) are just drug runners and pimps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with an extremely brutal streak that use the politics/religion as an excuse to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; play gangsters.
</EM><BR>
<P>My my my. What blinders we wear. I suppose you didn't read what I said (that you
<BR>
quoted) right above here, about my own disapproval of the IRA's ideology. Drug
<BR>
running is a typical fund raising schema for marxists (see the marxist guerrilla
<BR>
movements in Columbia, Burma, the Phillipines, and several other latin american
<BR>
locations, including Cuba).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The British soldiers are there to keep the peace, thankless task though that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure the Palestinians feel the same way about the Isreali Army.  The problem
<BR>
the British have is they can't decide how to finish the job. Either kick every
<BR>
Catholic out of NI and build a wall (or do another partition), or remove the
<BR>
Army and let them fight it out.
