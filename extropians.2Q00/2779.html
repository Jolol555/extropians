<P><EM>&gt; Well, this was my thinking. I'd always thought, based on my very cursory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowledge, that he was pro-democracy and all those other funky
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buzzwords.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, well, a lot of bad guys are buzzword compliant.  :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What's so bad about him? His predatory speculation/investing strategy?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm sort of curious, as I had always thought he was one of the few very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rich people who were making any headway as far as doing good goes...
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, he's a philanthropist, it's true, using his money to promote his
<BR>
idea of what society ought to be like.  In many cases, most notably
<BR>
Russia, this has been largely a good thing.  In many other cases, like
<BR>
pretty much every US domestic cause he supports, his policies lean
<BR>
towards authoritarianism and away from self-direction and
<BR>
self-government.
<BR>
<P>His picture of a well-oiled society is one in which the group rules
<BR>
the individual, while the group at large controls itself.  He calls
<BR>
this autonomy.
