<EM>&gt;he is as happy with the results as I am. I just don't worry about it.

<P>The problem with your analogy is that this hypothetical transporter
<BR>
duplicates a person and then annihilates one of the duplicates.  So, what
<BR>
is your expectation when you step onto the transporter platform?  Your
<BR>
self-awareness must continue into either the guy on the platform who gets
<BR>
annihilated, or the guy that comes out the other end, or neither, or both.
<BR>
(You will care more about the one into which your self-awareness will
<BR>
continue -- a lot more -- just like you care a lot more about yourself 50
<BR>
years from now than you do about someone else tomorrow, even though you now
<BR>
may be more similar to that other person tomorrow than to you in 50 years.)
<BR>
&nbsp;We can rule out both, (even if it could somehow be explained physically)
<BR>
since it violates our hypothesis of duplication.  If your single
<BR>
self-awareness existed in both at the same time, then that wouldn't really
<BR>
be duplication, just giving one person two brains and two bodies.
<BR>
<P>So, now what?  Well, we're assuming that each duplicate experiences a
<BR>
continuity of self-awareness with the original, but neither duplicate
<BR>
experiences it with the other.  With what should the original expect
<BR>
continuity?  If, rather than being annihilated, one of the duplicates were
<BR>
to be tortured, and the other were to be given $100, would you undergo
<BR>
duplication?  I wouldn't.  If one of the duplicates were to be slapped on
<BR>
the wrist, and the other were to be given $1 mil, would you undergo
<BR>
duplication?  I would.  Note that I'm not thinking altruistically at this
<BR>
point; whichever one I become, I won't care about the other one, even if
<BR>
he's &quot;just like me&quot;.  Rather, I'm thinking I have even odds of continuing
<BR>
into each duplicate.
<BR>
<P>Does anyone here disagree with my economic calculations above?  Would you
<BR>
be non-destructively transported if the guy on the ship were going to be
<BR>
tortured and the guy on the other end were going to get $100?  If not, why
<BR>
would you be willing to be destructively transported?
