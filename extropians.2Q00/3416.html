<EM>&gt;     &gt;so long as we all can't tell the difference that it doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter. While I would like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;reality to be as John describes, I have strong suspicions that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is not so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So even though you can't tell the difference it does matter? How?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Just because I cannot predict the outcome of an experiment, is a
<BR>
reason for caution. 
<BR>
<P>That I could not tell the difference AFTER the experiment is no
<BR>
guarantee that it worked the way I would have liked.
<BR>
No one (for the purposes of the argument) doubts that the copy would 
<BR>
believe in its own continuity. But I still have to make up *my* mind
<BR>
to go in at the sending end! 
<BR>
<P>There is a fundamental discontinuity that is apparent to other
<BR>
observers, the change in location (and possibly transmission time,
<BR>
during which the transportee would be reduced to data, elementary
<BR>
particles or whatever.)
<BR>
<P>Like Mr Lorrey, I would like to believe in transporters, I'm just not
<BR>
sure I can.
