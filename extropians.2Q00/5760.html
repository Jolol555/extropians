<P>
<EM>&gt; It's not so much the first wave of immigrants that's the problem as their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offspring. /They/ haven't witnessed the poverty of their parents'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; homeland;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they just know that they are at the bottom of their society with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little hope
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of moving up. That breeds frustration, envy, hatred and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ultimately...violence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;Your country was *built* by people like that.&lt;&lt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the problem is that hundred years ago, lack of skill was not such a
<BR>
great problem like it is now. We have about the same problem here in
<BR>
Germany, with an almost uncontrolled immigration. Most of those who come are
<BR>
unskilled. Many of them come from the Near East, and many of those are
<BR>
Muslims, and the big difference between the Christian religion and the
<BR>
Muslims is the fact that we had our Renaissance. They are still in the
<BR>
middle-ages. The cultural difference will pose a greater threat to our
<BR>
country than most people realize. Instead, some &quot;multi-cultural&quot; fanatics
<BR>
tell us that everything will be much better if we let all them in.
<BR>
<P>The second-generation immigrants are neither accepted by their own kin nor
<BR>
by the Germans. They lost their roots and are unable to adapt to our world.
<BR>
This in turn breeds frustration. And frustration leads to anger. Anger leads
<BR>
to hate. And hate leads to the dark side ... oh, well, to violence. We
<BR>
already have some places which are in much way similar to Ghettos ins the
<BR>
US.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It wasn't built by people from the 3rd world, but by (mostly)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Europeans. That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; makes a lot of difference. Had immigration patterns been from the very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beginning like they have been during the last 30 years, the US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; /would/ now be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3rd world nation.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a German author who once stated that if the Immigrants from Europe
<BR>
behaved in the US like they behaved in Africa, the US would now be a 3rd
<BR>
world country. Although it might be a little bit racist and in any case
<BR>
cynical to say that the US had the advantage of radically diminishing the
<BR>
natives population to a number that was no threat, I think that he is quite
<BR>
right. And no, this author is not a nazi, he's from the postwar generation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;That you have the gall to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to shut them out says more about your own inadequacy than anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else I could write.&lt;&lt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What a load of bull. No offence, but you, sir, have your head up your ass.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, perhaps we should demonstrate our cultural superiority by remaining
<BR>
polite, wouldn't that be a lot wiser. Let's stic to the facts and not get
<BR>
personal. After all, we're all intelligent enough to discuss things in a
<BR>
serious way.
