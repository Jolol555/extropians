<EM>&gt;|Sure, once tiny and powerful surveillance technology is in the hands of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;|masses we will all be vulnerable to the inquisitive and prurient interests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;|of our neighbors.  But the same tech that threatens us will also be there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;|protect us.  It is, of course, a double edged sword.  So you watched me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;|lounging in the nude last night?  Well guess what?  Someone watched you,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;|watching me and now *you're* going to jail.  Nyah, nyah.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And you don't notice how stupid the above sounds?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If snooping on your neighbour is illegal and everybody does it, then what?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Put everybody in prison?
</EM><BR>
<P>First, if it's illegal not *everybody* will do it.  There may be a high 
<BR>
incidence of illegal behavior, but that is usually not reason enough to 
<BR>
change the law or for the authorities not to enforce the law.  Think 
<BR>
marijuana.  It's illegal, but a significant proportion of the population has 
<BR>
indulged.  Including many on the police force.  But, guaranteed, if you 
<BR>
smoke a doobie in front of a cop, you will be cited.  Try and carry a kilo 
<BR>
or two through customs and you will be arrested.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Of course, if the Holier Than Thou start a jihad against anybody who is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like them, then they would naturally really _have_ to be holier than 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anybody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else since everybody will really be out to check their personal lives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The power mongers will naturally not like the idea that the commoners get 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;look at their magical kingdom, so you can be pretty certain that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will stand in the hand of the mighty, anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>It puzzles me how many people assume that the &quot;commoners&quot; must inevitably 
<BR>
bow to the will of the &quot;mighty&quot; on this issue.  The commoners (at least here 
<BR>
in the US) have a tradition of standing up and being counted when government 
<BR>
attempts to trample the rights of the little guy.  The NRA has successfully 
<BR>
kept attempts to disarm the populace at bay and will continue to do so for 
<BR>
the foreseeable future.  The suffrage movement secured women the right to 
<BR>
vote, contrary to the wishes of the powers that were and the civil rights 
<BR>
movement secured the ability of blacks to do the same in the 60's.  The 
<BR>
pro-choice movement and ACLU have repeatedly thwarted governmental attempts 
<BR>
to limit a woman's right to choose.
<BR>
<P>And those issues are questions over which the citizenry are/were sharply 
<BR>
divided.  If the technology for ubiquitous surveillance is deployed by the 
<BR>
government, yet denied to the populace, my guess is that mostly everyone 
<BR>
outside of government would be opposed.  You actually think the government 
<BR>
could ignore the wishes of virtually the entire population with impunity?  
<BR>
If so, you haven't studied your US history very well.
