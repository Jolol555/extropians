(reported by GBurch1)
<BR>
POGGIOLI says: There's a lot of anti-Americanism. That feeling has been
<BR>
latent in the European psyche for a long time.  And now as the average
<BR>
European sort of, you know, looks around, sees all this Americanization, the
<BR>
dominance of American movies, of music, the Internet, their baseball caps
<BR>
everywhere, and now fast-food outlets, there's a sense of creeping American
<BR>
colonialism.  And it's strengthening what the Europeans now call American
<BR>
culinary imperialism. And I think you can recognize that's the language of
<BR>
the old European left. It's fascinating to see how the old, you know, '68
<BR>
generation of lefties and political activists has transformed itself in
<BR>
middle age into food militants. And they've dived into the culinary trenches
<BR>
of what they see as the last kind of battlefield against American cultural
<BR>
encroachment.
<BR>
<P><P>Unfortunately what POGGIOLI is saying is true: anti-americanism now is
<BR>
stronger than last year.
<BR>
<P>That is due - in my opinion - to our EU quasi-flop (and many more countries
<BR>
are now entering in EU!). And also to the digital divide question. And also
<BR>
to the Microsoft case (a new Microsoft case soon in EU?). And also to those
<BR>
genetically modified foods.
<BR>
<P>But, listen, the genetically modified foods argument is very chaotic in EU.
<BR>
<P>The EU prohibits those genetically modified foods (and many are swiss!). But
<BR>
the EU - supported by many EU big companies - is also attempting to prohibit
<BR>
the classic old fashioned chocolate (without vegetable adds) and also the
<BR>
classic french cheese camembert and also the classic italian pizza (cooked
<BR>
in the old wood-burning oven) and also the wellknown tyroler smoked speck
<BR>
and pehaps (in the nearest future) even the parmisan cheese and the folk
<BR>
fresh mozzarella (without powdered milk).
<BR>
<P>So, in my opinion, this argument is not so sincere. There is (also) some
<BR>
industrial-political connection.
