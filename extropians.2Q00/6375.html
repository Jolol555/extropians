<P><EM>&gt;What do you think of Harvey's refinement that simply diverts the

&quot;killfiled&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;threads to a secondary list? No censorship there.
</EM><BR>
<P>If my tastes are offbeat I would be constantly switching between lists: your
<BR>
killfile and mine won't be exact matches. Of course if much of the community
<BR>
agrees that someone is a bozo I would want to factor that into my personal
<BR>
filter. But I want more features than just that; there still might be too
<BR>
much traffic on the primary list for me to go through when time is tight. I
<BR>
would much prefer to have deal with one list which meets my tastes. Rather
<BR>
than just sharing killfiles (that's sooo negative), this can be accomplished
<BR>
using collaborative filtering, as Sasha described.
<BR>
<P>BTW, the two-tier idea has been around for a while. Sarah Marr and Gregory
<BR>
Burch created the idea of &quot;NodeNets&quot; organized by topic area: invited &quot;ExI
<BR>
Professional Fellows&quot; could post, but all others would be read-only
<BR>
&quot;Observers.&quot; See &lt;<A HREF="http://www.extropy.com/nodenet/nodenet.htm">http://www.extropy.com/nodenet/nodenet.htm</A>&gt; for more
<BR>
information.
<BR>
<P>At the Foresight Senior Associates Gathering last month, it was announced
<BR>
that Ka-Ping Yee (lead developer of CritLink) has developed a system called
<BR>
Headspaces which might also be thought of as two-tier
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.headspaces.com/">http://www.headspaces.com/</A>&gt;. In this system, you have the option of
<BR>
receiving only the first message in a new thread. If it is of interest, you
<BR>
can go to the website and view the messages you missed and/or subscribe to
<BR>
the rest of the thread. You can also unsubscribe from threads, of course.
<BR>
This has some similarity to Harvey's idea in that some messages show up in
<BR>
your email, and others go to the archive (by default). But it lacks the
<BR>
rating system to determine when a thread has run its course.
