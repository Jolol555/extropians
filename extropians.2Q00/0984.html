<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Patriotism, IMO, is a very anti-extropian sentiment. For the proof of

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the pudding, just go read any history of the first world war (one that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't focus on the trivial US involvement in that struggle, but goes

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; into the broad picture).

<EM>&gt; &gt; 300,000 dead and several times that disfigured and disabled is hardly a

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where did you get the 300,000 dead from? The figure I'm working from is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 60,000 US soldiers dead -- putting the USA in roughly fourteenth place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the conflict. (Citation: &quot;The First World War&quot;, Martin Gilbert.)

<P>This is as I recall from school. I could be wrong, and I might have mixed that
<BR>
up with WWII losses. In any event, even accepting your figures, that would be
<BR>
more losses in less than two years than we incurred over more than ten years of
<BR>
involvement in Vietnam, at a time when our population was something like 1/4 the
<BR>
level it was at the time of Vietnam. All of this on something that really had
<BR>
nothing to do with us. If it weren't for the Lusitania sinking and the Zimmerman
<BR>
Telegram, we'd have likely stayed out of it. As it is, I think they were rather
<BR>
lame reasons to go to war, as the boat wasn't ours and it WAS carrying
<BR>
munitions. Smart money would have had us beef up Pershings forces on the Mexican
<BR>
border, made some sort of ultimatum to the Mexicans to stay uninvolved, and
<BR>
invested heavily in anti-submarine warfare to protect our shipping.
