<EM>&gt;     &gt; I've mirrored the Green Party platform and linked it in through Crit at

<EM>&gt; Crit didn't seem to be working when I looked, but I probably wouldn't have written
</EM><BR>
<P>What did it do? Did it give you error messages? Please let me know in a private
<BR>
email if that's not too much trouble. Thanks for alerting me to the problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; anything anyway, almost every line was so stupid I didn't know were to begin.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They have learned one thing from capitalism however, I've heard that the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important word in advertising, even more important than &quot;new&quot; or &quot;improved&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is &quot;free&quot;. I counted 18 uses of the word &quot;free&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, to their credit they probably meant more along the lines of
<BR>
free-speach rather than free-beer, and that's the part I find most
<BR>
ironic. The document seems to be a compromise between anarchist and
<BR>
socialist factions within the Green party. Even as they're talking
<BR>
about regulating the life out of everything they can lay their mitts
<BR>
on, and OPPOSING tort reform, they're also talking about decentralizing
<BR>
government and protecting the Bill of Rights. Which one will it be?
<BR>
<P>PS: I guess it's as good a time to announce it as any. While you're at
<BR>
the top level site, you might want to check out my Open Bible Project.
<BR>
Possibly coming soon: Open Apocrypha, Open Talmud, Open Torah, Open Q'uran
