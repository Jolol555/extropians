<EM>&gt;From: James Rogers &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jamesr@best.com?Subject=Re:%20Death%20Penalty%20(was%20Re:%20Didn't%20need%20no%20welfare%20state)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000418165450.30111.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">jamesr@best.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;While I am very big on individual self defense, I have come to abhor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;state-sponsored killing in general.  As things currently stand in most if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not all countries, the state is not held to the same standards of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;justifiable homicide as the individual.  While creating such a standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effectively eliminates the death penalty, in the absence of such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;standard I would prefer to explicitly eliminate this ability from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;state.  Arguably, only individuals can have the right of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self-defense anyway, since the government is made up of nothing more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individuals.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds nice.  But the minute you hold the state to the same standard as 
<BR>
individuals, the state gives up all police power (except in those few 
<BR>
circumstances were governmental employees or property are harmed or 
<BR>
threatened) and all prisons must be emptied.  That might sound like a good 
<BR>
thing to you, but the day it happens here is the day I move to Costa Rica.
