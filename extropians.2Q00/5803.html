<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                    June 22, 2000
<BR>
<P>NEW IMAGES SUGGEST PRESENT-DAY SOURCES OF LIQUID WATER ON MARS
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what could turn out to be a landmark discovery in the 
<BR>
history of Mars exploration, imaging scientists using data from 
<BR>
NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft have recently observed 
<BR>
features that suggest there may be current sources of liquid 
<BR>
water at or near the surface of the red planet.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new images, available at <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/pictures/mars">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/pictures/mars</A> 
<BR>
or <A HREF="http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/june2000/">http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/june2000/</A> , show the smallest 
<BR>
features ever observed from martian orbit -- about the size of a 
<BR>
sport-utility vehicle.  NASA scientists compare the features to 
<BR>
those left by flash floods on Earth.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We see features that look like gullies formed by flowing 
<BR>
water and the deposits of soil and rocks transported by these 
<BR>
flows. The features appear to be so young that they might be 
<BR>
forming today. We think we are seeing evidence of a groundwater 
<BR>
supply, similar to an aquifer,&quot; said Dr. Michael Malin, principal 
<BR>
investigator for the Mars Orbiter Camera on the Mars Global 
<BR>
Surveyor spacecraft at Malin Space Science Systems, San Diego, 
<BR>
Calif.  &quot;These are new landforms that have never been seen before 
<BR>
on Mars.&quot;  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings will be published in the June 30 issue of 
<BR>
Science magazine.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Twenty-eight years ago the Mariner 9 spacecraft found 
<BR>
evidence -- in the form of channels and valleys -- that billions 
<BR>
of years ago the planet had water flowing across its surface,&quot; 
<BR>
said Dr. Ken Edgett, staff scientist at Malin Space Science 
<BR>
Systems and co-author of the paper in Science. &quot;Ever since that 
<BR>
time, Mars science has focused on the question, 'Where did the 
<BR>
water go?' The new pictures from Global Surveyor tell us part of 
<BR>
the answer -- some of that water went under ground, and quite 
<BR>
possibly it's still there.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For two decades scientists have debated whether liquid 
<BR>
water might have existed on the surface of Mars just a few 
<BR>
billion years ago,&quot; said Dr. Ed Weiler, associate administrator 
<BR>
for space science at NASA Headquarters.  &quot;With today's discovery, 
<BR>
we're no longer talking about a distant time. The debate has 
<BR>
moved to present-day Mars.  The presence of liquid water on Mars 
<BR>
has profound implications for the question of life not only in 
<BR>
the past, but perhaps even today.  If life ever did develop 
<BR>
there, and if it survives to the present time, then these 
<BR>
landforms would be great places to look.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gullies observed in the images are on cliffs, usually in 
<BR>
crater or valley walls, and are made up of a deep channel with a 
<BR>
collapsed region at its upper end (an &quot;alcove&quot;) and at the other 
<BR>
end an area of accumulated debris (an &quot;apron&quot;) that appears to 
<BR>
have been transported down the slope.  Relative to the rest of 
<BR>
the martian surface, the gullies appear to be extremely young, 
<BR>
meaning they may have formed in the recent past. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They could be a few million years old, but we cannot rule 
<BR>
out that some of them are so recent as to have formed yesterday,&quot; 
<BR>
Malin said. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the atmospheric pressure at the surface of Mars is 
<BR>
about 100 times less than it is at sea level on Earth, liquid 
<BR>
water would immediately begin to boil when exposed at the martian 
<BR>
surface.  Investigators believe that this boiling would be 
<BR>
violent and explosive.  So how can these gullies form?  Malin 
<BR>
explained that the process must involve repeated outbursts of 
<BR>
water and debris, similar to flash floods on Earth.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We've come up with a model to explain these features and 
<BR>
why the water would flow down the gullies instead of just boiling 
<BR>
off the surface.  When water evaporates it cools the ground -- 
<BR>
that would cause the water behind the initial seepage site to 
<BR>
freeze. This would result in pressure building up behind an 'ice 
<BR>
dam.'  Ultimately, the dam would break and send a flood down the 
<BR>
gully,&quot; said Edgett.   
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The occurrence of gullies is quite rare: only a few hundred 
<BR>
locations have been seen in the many tens of thousands of places 
<BR>
surveyed by the orbiter camera.  Most are in the martian southern 
<BR>
hemisphere, but a few are in the north.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is odd about these gullies is that they occur where 
<BR>
you might not expect them -- in some of the coldest places on the 
<BR>
planet,&quot; Malin indicated.  &quot;Nearly all occur between latitudes 30 
<BR>
degrees and 70 degrees, and usually on slopes that get the least 
<BR>
amount of sunlight during each Martian day.&quot;  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these gullies were on Earth they would be at latitudes 
<BR>
roughly between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Point Barrow, Alaska, 
<BR>
in the northern hemisphere; and Sydney, Australia, to much of the 
<BR>
Antarctic coast in the south.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water supply is believed to be about 100 to 400 meters 
<BR>
(300 to 1,300 feet) below the surface, and limited to specific 
<BR>
regions across the planet.  Each flow that came down each gully 
<BR>
may have had a volume of water of, roughly, 2,500 cubic meters 
<BR>
(about 90,000 cubic feet) -- about enough water to sustain 100 
<BR>
average households for a month or fill seven community-size 
<BR>
swimming pools. The process that starts the water flowing remains 
<BR>
a mystery, but the team believes it is not the result of volcanic 
<BR>
heating.   
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think one of the most interesting and significant aspects 
<BR>
of this discovery is what it could mean if human explorers ever 
<BR>
go to Mars,&quot; said Malin.  &quot;If water is available in substantial 
<BR>
volumes in areas other than the poles, it would make it easier 
<BR>
for human crews to access and use it -- for drinking, to create 
<BR>
breathable air, and to extract oxygen and hydrogen for rocket 
<BR>
fuel or to be stored for use in portable energy sources.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This latest discovery by the Mars Global Surveyor is a true 
<BR>
'watershed' -- that is, a revolution that pushes the history of 
<BR>
water on Mars into the present,&quot; said Dr. Jim Garvin, Mars 
<BR>
Program Scientist, NASA Headquarters.  &quot;To follow up on this 
<BR>
discovery we will continue the search with Mars Global Surveyor 
<BR>
and its rich array of remote sensing instruments, and in 2001, 
<BR>
NASA will launch a scientific orbiter with a high spatial 
<BR>
resolution middle-infrared imaging system that will examine the 
<BR>
seepage sites in search of evidence of water-related minerals.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Furthermore, NASA is in the process of evaluating two 
<BR>
options for a 2003 mission to Mars, both of which could provide 
<BR>
independent information concerning the remarkable sites 
<BR>
identified by Malin and Edgett.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, Calif., 
<BR>
manages the Mars Global Surveyor mission for NASA's Office of 
<BR>
Space Science, Washington, D.C. JPL is a division of the 
<BR>
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.  Malin Space 
<BR>
Science Systems built and operates the camera system.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JPL's industrial partner is Lockheed Martin Astronautics, 
<BR>
Denver, Colo., which developed and operates the spacecraft.
