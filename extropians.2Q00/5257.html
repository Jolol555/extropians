<P>
Note: this intended to be kept simple. You could 
<BR>
also add living expenses, capital gains, income tax, 
<BR>
loans with interest, etc.
<BR>
===========
<BR>
<P>Let's Play Inflation!
<BR>
<P>Here is a way for you to teach your children 
<BR>
how inflation works!
<BR>
<P>All you need is an ordinary Monopoly® set. 
<BR>
You only need to change one rule!
<BR>
<P>Make yourself the banker (and of course the government),
<BR>
Count out the money for everyone just like normal.
<BR>
(To make it go faster, deal out the properties at the start.)
<BR>
<P>Here is the one rule change: any time you need extra 
<BR>
money, just help yourself to the bank's money. 
<BR>
After all, you are the bank! 
<BR>
You can print up more if you need to!
<BR>
<P>Now, start playing, just like normal.
<BR>
<P>As you go along, offer to buy someone else's property 
<BR>
at a high price. You can do this because you are the government.
<BR>
Now of course they have more money too! 
<BR>
Now they can offer to buy properties at a higher price, 
<BR>
but only after you did first!
<BR>
Keep doing this over and over as the game goes on.
<BR>
<P>Notice how the prices just keep going up?
<BR>
<P>(If you want, put up your houses and hotels any old 
<BR>
time you please. Instead of putting money in the bank 
<BR>
to buy them (since it is your money anyway), pay it 
<BR>
out to the other players, as if they were the contractors 
<BR>
for the buildings. Later in the game, they might want charge
<BR>
more for this because the prices of property went up so much.
<BR>
They also might want to raise the rents.)
<BR>
<P>Who do you suppose will win this game?
<BR>
<P>Did your children get angry about this?
<BR>
<P>Now, you may have to add one more rule if they 
<BR>
happen to catch on: they can never, ever use anything besides 
<BR>
Monopoly ® bank money to play. Don't let them try to 
<BR>
buy something with real money. If they do, take all their 
<BR>
money and lock them in their rooms.
<BR>
