<EM>&gt; ... If you call yourself a member of a philosophy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that has a specific list of principles, and yet you do not agree with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them all, then as you say it is a simple tautology that you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not actually a member of that philosophy, and continuing to use the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; term to describe yourself is either self-deceptive or insulting to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others.
</EM><BR>
<P>You really should read beyond the first sentence of my reply, and if
<BR>
you did, do it again with more effort in understanding.  How do we
<BR>
know that it's not /you/ who misunderstands or misinterprets the basic
<BR>
principles, while I'm the &quot;real&quot; Extropian?  We don't until we examine
<BR>
it.  How do we know the principles themselves don't contain internal
<BR>
inconsistencies theat further discussion will bring to light?  Those
<BR>
who bring up such issues are doing the real work of thought, and are
<BR>
not deceiving themselves or others in any way.
<BR>
<P>Don't mistake me for an &quot;inclusionist&quot; who thinks philosophies should
<BR>
be watered down to gain following--I'm just the opposite.  I think
<BR>
philosophies should be clarified and their implications examined in
<BR>
detail; if other philosophies break from them, that's good too.  I do
<BR>
think there are those who may deceptively label themselves with a
<BR>
philosophy they don't actually hold, but I do not for a moment think
<BR>
that it is easy to determine which those are, apart from those who
<BR>
honestly believe they do espouse the philosophy though they may have
<BR>
disagreements about details with others.  I am not so juvenile to
<BR>
think simple black-and-white lines can be drawn easily.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
