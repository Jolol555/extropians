<P>New Potential Drug Target For Alzheimer's Disease 
<BR>
<P>Researchers at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine and the 
<BR>
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons have determined that a 
<BR>
cell receptor, called RAGE, may be a new potential target for compounds that 
<BR>
may treat or prevent Alzheimer's disease. 
<BR>
The study leaders were Shi Du Yan, M.D., assistant professor of pathology, 
<BR>
and David Stern, M.D., professor of physiology and cellular biophysics and of 
<BR>
surgery, both at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, 
<BR>
and Mark Kindy, Ph.D., associate professor of biochemistry at the UK College 
<BR>
of Medicine, UK Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, Stroke Program at the UK 
<BR>
Chandler Medical Center, and Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Lexington. 
<BR>
The results of the research are published in the June issue of Nature 
<BR>
Medicine. 
<BR>
<P>About 60,000 Kentuckians have Alzheimer's disease, and, nationally, 4 million 
<BR>
people are estimated to have the disease. A protein called amyloid-beta is 
<BR>
thought to be critical in the development of Alzheimer's disease, although 
<BR>
the exact role of amyloid-beta is unknown. Aggregated amyloid-beta proteins, 
<BR>
also called amyloid fibrils, are found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients 
<BR>
and cause tissue damage and eventually death. 
<BR>
<P>The UK researchers have shown that a receptor -- called the receptor for 
<BR>
advanced glycation endproducts (or RAGE) and located on the surface of 
<BR>
certain neurons -- interacts with amyloid fibrils. RAGE is a multiligand 
<BR>
receptor, meaning that it interacts with many molecules. When RAGE interacts 
<BR>
with the amyloid fibrils, it accelerates fibril formation and induces 
<BR>
cellular dysfunction. 
<BR>
<P>UK researchers disrupted the interaction of RAGE with amyloid fibrils two 
<BR>
ways. They added additional amounts of soluble RAGE to neurons with amyloid 
<BR>
fibrils. Because the RAGE molecules were not linked to cells, they could 
<BR>
interact with the fibrils but not cause cellular dysfunction. They also added 
<BR>
an antibody to RAGE that would bind to the receptor and prevent any 
<BR>
interaction with amyloid fibrils. 
<BR>
<P>Both methods suppressed amyloid formation in a systemic model of amyloid 
<BR>
diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In addition, by blocking RAGE with 
<BR>
an antibody, the researchers found that the process of amyloid fibril 
<BR>
deposition was reversed. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The exciting thing about this research is that it suggests that RAGE may be 
<BR>
a potential target for inhibiting amyloid fibril deposition, which would 
<BR>
likely inhibit the progression of Alzheimer's disease,&quot; Kindy said.
