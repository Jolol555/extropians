<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't think it's possible to have an infinite utility. Here's a
</EM><BR>
thought
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; experiment to find out what your maximum utility is:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Suppose a genie told you that he could grant you one wish (which may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; composed of an infinite number of subwishes), but first you would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tortured for a year, and then the wish only has 1% chance of coming
</EM><BR>
true.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Would you accept? What if the wish has only 0.1% chance of coming true?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Keep lowering the probability until you refuse to accept. Now divide
</EM><BR>
zero
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; minus the of the utility of being tortured by that probability to get
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; maximum utility.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think I'd take a year of torture even for a 100% chance of having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every wish granted.  At least not if it was bad torture.  Maybe a day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of torture, but not a year.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is it possible though that I'm not being rational in saying this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe the rational thing to do is to take the torture, in the sense that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if I did, afterwards I would say it was the right decision.  But perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am too blinded by fear to go through with it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>

<P>You could always wish for the universe to be rewound (time wise) to a point
<BR>
where the initial choice was presented to you, and change the choice to &quot;How
<BR>
would you like infinite wishes right now buddy, with no hassles&quot;. Maybe
<BR>
you'd be too twisted after a year of torture (maybe!), to be able to do
<BR>
anything sensible with the wishes when/if you got them, even if there was
<BR>
100% probability of receiving them.
<BR>
<P>No, I wouldn't bite at this one either, even if the wish were certain to be
<BR>
granted.
