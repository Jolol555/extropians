<P><EM>&gt; I suppose I can see how her ideas on &quot;egoism&quot; might lead an others-centered 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  person (such as, apparently, yourself) to view her ideas this way. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I did not say I was others centered. That's preposterous. I said I was a 
<BR>
person who loved. I love myself. I love things passionately ... thing outside 
<BR>
myself: my lover, my family, my smallest closest circle of friends, new 
<BR>
people, things, animals, genres of art, music, TV, books, conversation, this 
<BR>
list...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  initially, her ideas struck me as narcissistic and selfish.  But I've 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  gradually come to believe that narcissism and, particularly, selfishness 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  have traditionally gotten a bad rap.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Narcissism is a mental illness. I hope you understand that. It is a condition 
<BR>
that can be cripplingly debilitating and wreak havoc in many people's lives. 
<BR>
It is a delusional condition. I know people who suffer from it and it is not 
<BR>
pretty.
<BR>
<P>What you mean I assume is healthy self esteem and the ability to draw 
<BR>
boundaries --  letting religions and manipulative forces use the guilt factor 
<BR>
to cause you to do damaging thing to yourself in the name of altruism. If 
<BR>
you're a doormat, may I suggest a codependents anonymous meeting (or therapy) 
<BR>
instead of reading about selfish industrialists with gold mines who like to 
<BR>
sneer at the masses. It will hone your communication skills to boot.
<BR>
<P>IMO we are all born self centered. This is normal, but hopefully we learn to 
<BR>
curb that impulse when we learn the rest of the world is interactive. Being a 
<BR>
grabby child at 35 is OK BY ME ... but OFTEN it doesn't serve the situation, 
<BR>
or infringes on other's boundaries or causes pain to others.
<BR>
<P>I am sorry you were raised Christian, I was not. I am glad you turned away 
<BR>
from it's irrational grasp. Sorry to hear you fell for more dogma.
<BR>
<P>The character in the Fountainhead would NEVER have been a follower of dogma 
<BR>
that's the funny part. Howard Roarke at an objectivists gathering?? bahaha 
<BR>
gimme a break.
<BR>
<P>A healthy person does not need to be told to be more selfish, it comes 
<BR>
naturally to love one's self and to have integrity to one's own ego. A 
<BR>
healthy person also doesn't need THAT much control over others -- or need to 
<BR>
smugly put-down those who haven't learned to take care of themselves, and to 
<BR>
build themselves up with bogus pomposity and leering condescension for 
<BR>
everyone else.
<BR>
<P>We don't need to expound the virtue of selfishness any more than we need to 
<BR>
expound the virtue of breathing air. 
<BR>
<P>Mostly a self absorbed person is truly a bore. They go from person to person 
<BR>
saying the same thing over and over. What ever it is about, it is about them 
<BR>
and theirs -- material stuff, ideas, stories, objectivists or political ideas 
<BR>
... whatever it is...
<BR>
<P>The same shtick goes for everyone. They don't have enough awareness of 
<BR>
&quot;others&quot; to curb their self talk and don't have the people skills/tools to 
<BR>
see how they are being perceived. They test the boundaries of patience in 
<BR>
polite conversation. Usually they take themselves waaaaay too seriously too 
<BR>
and get annoyed at anyone who tries to bringing in an outside viewpoint.
<BR>
<P>Actually I just read Natasha Vita More's well thought out post about Ayn 
<BR>
rand's tracts on art

<P><EM>&gt;  Her rigidity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and lack of experience in Contemporary Art seems to be reflective of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rigidity in her psychology and her need for control.  This behavior runs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  contrary to the open mindedness and curious attitude which can be aroused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  by fluidity and uncertainty.  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>TO ME it always boils down to the fact that selfish-self absorbed people are 
<BR>
often &quot;rigid and lacking in experience&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>How can you be UTTERLY focused on yourself 100% of the time and find the time 
<BR>
to 
<BR>
look openly at life outside your own sphere? To be open minded? Listen? 
<BR>
Especially since people are ALWAYS contradicting you, challenging your ideas, 
<BR>
disagreeing? 
<BR>
<P><P>Her ideas to me, are not ideas at all. They are pathological quest to justify 
<BR>
a huge amount of psychological pain over indignities she endured in Communist 
<BR>
Russia and a total lack of empathy. She describes a feeling of &quot;otherness&quot; or 
<BR>
distance from humanity. A disdain for the masses.  A destructive bitterness. 
<BR>
And a confusion as to how the 'rest' of us can be so stupid as to care about 
<BR>
other people. Again a total lack of empathy. Again, when i read he words, I 
<BR>
dont see an UPLIFTING of the PERFECT man,  I see only bitterness, misery, 
<BR>
vilification, sneering, loathing and a general distaste for everyone who 
<BR>
doesn't see things her way. Her own tragic life is proof of how effective 
<BR>
this kind of pathology was at bringing happiness.
