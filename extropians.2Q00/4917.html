FASEB J 14(9): 1132-1138 Jun 2000
<BR>
<P>Abstract:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent data from this laboratory demonstrate that increasing 
<BR>
adipocyte intracellular Ca(2+) results in a coordinated stimulation of
<BR>
lipogenesis and inhibition of lipolysis. we have also noted that
<BR>
increasing dietary calcium of obese patients for 1 year resulted in a 4.9
<BR>
kg loss of body fat (P&lt;0.01). Accordingly, we tested the possibility that
<BR>
calcitrophic hormones may act on adipocytes to increase Ca(2+) and lipid
<BR>
metabolism by measuring the effects of 1,25-(OH)(2)-D in primary cultures
<BR>
of human adipocytes, and found significant, sustained increases in
<BR>
intracellular Ca(2+) and a corresponding marked inhibition of lipolysis
<BR>
(EC(50) 50pM;P&lt;0.001), suggesting that dietary calcium could reduce
<BR>
adipocyte mass by suppressing 1,25-(OH)(2)-D. To test this hypothesis, we
<BR>
placed transgenic mice expresing the agouti gene specifically in
<BR>
adipocytes on a low (0.4%) Ca/high fat/high sucrose diet either 
<BR>
unsupplemented or with 25 or 50% of the protein replaced by non-fat dry
<BR>
milk or supplemented to 1.2% Ca with CaCO(3) for 6 wk. Weight gain and fat
<BR>
pad mass were reduced by 26-39% by the three high calcium diets
<BR>
(P&lt;0.001). The high calcium diets exerted a corresponding 51% inhibition
<BR>
of adipocyte fatty acid synthase expression and activity (P&lt;0.002) and
<BR>
stimulation of lipolysis by 3.4- to 5.2-fold (P&lt;0.015). This concept of
<BR>
calcium modulation of adiposity was further evaluated epidemiologically in
<BR>
the NHANES III data set. After controlling for energy intake, relative
<BR>
risk of being in the highest quartile of body fat was set to 1.00 for the
<BR>
lowest quartile of Ca intake and was reduced to 0.75, 0.40, and 0.16 for
<BR>
the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively, of calcium intake
<BR>
for women (n=380;P&lt;0.0009); a similar inverse relationship was noted in
<BR>
men (n=7114;P&lt;0.0006). Thus, increasing dietary calcium suppresses 
<BR>
adipocyte intracellular Ca(2+) and thereby modulates energy metabolism and
<BR>
attenuates obesity risk.
