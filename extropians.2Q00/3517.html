<EM>&gt; What's Tagging?
</EM><BR>
<P>Mike, the fact that you don't know what tagging is may shine some light on 
<BR>
why you and I have a totally different world view. You are sheltered, boy.
<BR>
<P>Tagging of course, is the gang names painted on (usually) city walls (though 
<BR>
in beautiful nearby Vasquez rock you still see it). It is similar to the way 
<BR>
dogs mark their territory. If a gang tags a particular street or neighborhood 
<BR>
it means &quot;watch out his is ours&quot;. People her in Lovely LAPD land are 
<BR>
sometimes even shot on sight for this, but they do it anyway. Shootouts with 
<BR>
the police are common, as well as other gangs who's name you are spraying 
<BR>
over. It's more than vandalism, it signifies a whole way of life. It is one 
<BR>
of the dumbest things a person can do, but it takes big BIG cohones; hence it 
<BR>
is respected by street fighters. 
<BR>
<P><P>I could give a shit about fur coats.  Most people who feel the need to 
<BR>
procalim &quot;meat is murder&quot; really could look into helping peolpe instead. I 
<BR>
don't think they're animal lovers as much as people -haters; ). They want 
<BR>
pulbcity. No on e watching, what would be the point? Plus throwing red paint 
<BR>
at a rich bitch isnt really such a big crime, it's just more vandalism.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  IMHO OK Bad behaviors when nobody is watching or around:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  speeding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  catch &amp; not release
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  running red lights &amp; stop signs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  streaking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  outdoors sex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  billboard sabotage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  foodfights at MacDonalds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  One of my favorites:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Back in college, when someone passed out at our frat house, a group of us 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  'food' them, which entailed moving them to the banquet table, and dressing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  up with various foods from the kitchen such that they looked like a buffet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  spread.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Ok Mike, 
<BR>
Except for catch and not release ( which is more archaic than anything else), 
<BR>
running red lights which could get you killed accidentally, and Billboard 
<BR>
sabotage, (which sounds suspiciously a lot like tagging...) 
<BR>
...what is 'bad' about any of those things? They sound harmless, and you 
<BR>
propbably like it if people *are* watching... ; - ) ; ) : )
