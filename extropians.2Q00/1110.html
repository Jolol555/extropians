<EM>&gt; &gt; This is a false dichotomy.  Those who are found not to lock up

<EM>&gt; their guns by something happening (like a kid finding one and

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as they have demonstrated that they are incapable of exercising

<EM>&gt; OK, I'd agree with that plan.  However, ever gun-control advocate I've

<P>Joe just won't admit to it. The severity of his idea indicates his sentiment.
<BR>
<P>I have said that parents whose kids commit gun crimes should be held responsible
<BR>
for negligent homicide. Finding a kid merely in posession (on the way to rifle
<BR>
or skeet team practice)  does not justify what Joe wants. Joe wants to prevent
<BR>
all those crack baby gang bangers from being able to protect themselves (and
<BR>
cause trouble), but is also satisfied to throw the baby out with the bath water
<BR>
and prohibit harmless use by kids. My dad, living in Lowell, Mass as a kid,
<BR>
would often ride on the bus, or on his bike, with rifle or shotgun in hand (or
<BR>
across his handlebars) so he could participate on the rifle team, or to go
<BR>
hunting with freinds after school...they never had any problems or misuse.
