<BR>
|This is not very attractive for Extropians.
<BR>

<BR>
|I think we do better to encourage aggressive research into biotech.
<BR>
<P>How?  To encourage aggressive research requires lots of money,
<BR>
<P>Today there exists a number of substances which can treat various tropical
<BR>
diseases, but their production have been discontinued, since the diseases
<BR>
only occur in the poorest countries, and the people who live there cannot
<BR>
pay for the production.  I understand some corporatuons try to sell the
<BR>
patents to the WHO, but its members appear reluctant to pay the prices.
<BR>
Biotechnology costs, you know.
<BR>
<P>Any suggestions on how to solve this equation?
<BR>
<P>|The more we learn about how bacteria operate, the better the chances of
<BR>
|coming up with a truly effective method of controlling harmful bacteria.
<BR>
<P>Knowledge on how bacteria work will make marvels in the hands of good people,
<BR>
and make mighty nightmares in the hands of evil humans.
<BR>
May the best team win!
<BR>
<P>|I understand that bacteria are biologically very different from the kinds
<BR>
|of cells which make up our bodies.  We need to find something that can
<BR>
|prevent them from reproducing without harming our cells, something so
<BR>
|fundamental that they can't evolve away from it.  Hopefully, research
<BR>
|will hit upon a &quot;magic bullet&quot; like this within the next few years.
<BR>
<P>The fundamental biochemical processes of life appear everywhere.  Bacteria
<BR>
have this magical weapon: they take parts of DNA from other life forms and
<BR>
incorporate into their own DNA programming. This could make it somewhat
<BR>
hard to eliminate them. Anyways, we would only wish to get rid of _some_
<BR>
of the bacteria.  Humans would find a world without bacteria a less than
<BR>
perfect world, I am sure.
