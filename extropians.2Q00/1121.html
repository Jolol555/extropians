</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;While I am very big on individual self defense, I have come to abhor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;state-sponsored killing in general.  As things currently stand in most if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;not all countries, the state is not held to the same standards of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;justifiable homicide as the individual.  While creating such a standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;effectively eliminates the death penalty, in the absence of such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;standard I would prefer to explicitly eliminate this ability from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;state.  Arguably, only individuals can have the right of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;self-defense anyway, since the government is made up of nothing more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;individuals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sounds nice.  But the minute you hold the state to the same standard as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individuals, the state gives up all police power (except in those few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumstances were governmental employees or property are harmed or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threatened) and all prisons must be emptied.  That might sound like a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing to you, but the day it happens here is the day I move to Costa Rica.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, this is not true. The only greater authority police have that you and
<BR>
I don't have is the ability to give traffic tickets, and in some states, arrest
<BR>
for misdemeanor offenses. We are all authorized and responsible to apprehend
<BR>
criminals committing felonies, and in the face of threat of deadly force, with
<BR>
unarmed individuals present, lethal force is generally legal, though there are
<BR>
differing thresholds.
<BR>
<P>The cops don't like people knowing this, because, of course, they are a union,
<BR>
and like any union, they try to protect their turf and prevent non-unionized
<BR>
individuals from working in the same occupation...
