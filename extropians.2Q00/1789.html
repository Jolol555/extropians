<P>
The ever feisty Rob responds:
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;Gross over-simplification and grossly unfair to the republican movement.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's definitely an oversimplification if you take it as a complete rundown
<BR>
of the entire situation, but it was not. I wrote only to counter the idea
<BR>
that was being entertained that the problem is caused by British invaders
<BR>
splitting an otherwise peaceful Eire in two. I also endeavoured to explain
<BR>
the source of my hatred for the IRA - basically, I think I coined it best in
<BR>
my response to Mike Lorrey when I said that most reasonable people will lose
<BR>
sympathy for a cause once they start blowing kids up. It is simply this.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;You omit the fact that the unionists practiced systematic discrimination
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;against catholics up until the late sixties/early seventies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Relevant to the IRA situation, but irrelevant to the points I was making. It
<BR>
is important to remember that the catholic-republican and
<BR>
protestant-loyalist correlation has been lost due to sickening IRA terrorist
<BR>
activity which has divided the line between loyalists and republicans more
<BR>
through a like/dislike for ultra-violence against innocents than anything
<BR>
else.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;You omit
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the fun little festivities such as the marching season.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, irrelevant to my point, but I notice that you omit the orangemen -
<BR>
the organisation with the most disruptive and dangerous march route, are
<BR>
catholic and republican.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;You omit the nice
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;guys from the UVF and UFF who are just as partial to murder and maiming of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;their opponents as the IRA.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, but they never blew up any innocent members of the public, now did
<BR>
they? The IRA do plenty of that - the source of their whole image problem.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; You omit the complete fuck-up by the British
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;government in 1971-76 -- who, to be fair, didn't have a clue what sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;meat-grinder they were sticking their dick into, and who didn't realise
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that the Paratroop Regiment *weren't* trained in police and counter-
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;insurgency duties.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's beyond me that you can hold this relevant to my points.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;You omit the fact that even if Sinn Fein is willing to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;take a moderate route and go into disarmament talks, they *can't do so*
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;unless they can pursuade the Provisionals to go along with them, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the Ulster Unionists are in the same bind vis-a-vis the UFF and UVF.
</EM><BR>
<P>The above is true, but again, irrelevant. My gripe is with the source of all
<BR>
of this, the republicans. If they vanished, the problem would vanish, it's
<BR>
as simple as that. And so why are they causing this problem? Because they
<BR>
want power, that's why - and feel that mob rule in NI and bombing of
<BR>
innocent men, women and children all over the UK is an honorable method of
<BR>
achieving this. THIS is the source of British disgust for the IRA - the
<BR>
tactics. The utter contempt for EVERYONE except the republicans. They are
<BR>
vile, evil little children. Kicking their feet because they want control no
<BR>
matter what, and they'll kill anyone to get it. I personally don't give a
<BR>
flying fuck how hard done by they were 50 years ago, I'd hate the Jews too
<BR>
if their response to the Hitler thing was random bombing of innocent people
<BR>
completely irrelevant to their suffering - and nobody sane would ever put
<BR>
the holocaust in the same league as what historically speaking only amounts
<BR>
to some internal squabbling in Northern Ireland.
<BR>
Bombing politicians is one thing - everyone secretly smiles when that
<BR>
happens, but you bomb innocent people, and expect to be hated too. I don't
<BR>
see what's so hard to grasp about this.
<BR>
<P>So look at your statement again:
<BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;....grossly unfair to the republican movement.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think not.
<BR>
<P>Rob.
<BR>
<P>BTW, have a gander at <A HREF="http://www.nio.gov.uk/dp1972.htm">http://www.nio.gov.uk/dp1972.htm</A> for detailed info on
<BR>
the NI situation from the horse's mouth.
