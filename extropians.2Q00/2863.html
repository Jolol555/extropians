<EM>&gt; My question is this, how can the &quot;old guy&quot; be dead when you remember being
</EM><BR>
him?
<BR>
<P>How can Jesus be dead when people claim to be him?  I think anybody can be
<BR>
brainwashed or programmed into believing they are anybody else.  I don't see
<BR>
this as scientific evidence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not exactly sure what a &quot;consciousness stream&quot; is but it doesn't seem
</EM><BR>
to me that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it's been interrupted
</EM><BR>
<P>You are switching the old Harvey Newstrom body with a new one.  The
<BR>
viewpoint to the outside world is that it looks the same.  The viewpoint of
<BR>
the old Harvey Newstrom is the same as it was in the old body, and never
<BR>
transfers to the new body.  The viewpoint of the new body would never match
<BR>
that of the original Harvey Newstrom unless its original memory is erased
<BR>
and replaced with false memories matching the originals.
<BR>
<P>All you have created is an external facade that looks the same as the
<BR>
original.  The viewpoint or experience of the original Harvey Newstrom never
<BR>
transfers to the new body.  To cover up this failure, you require that the
<BR>
original be killed, or else he would complain that the transfer failed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; you don't think the atoms are important, I doubt you want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to invoke an immortal soul; so what has changed so much that the fellow
</EM><BR>
who believes
<BR>
<EM>&gt; with every fiber in his being that he's good old Harvey Newstrom is
</EM><BR>
actually wrong?
<BR>
<P>What makes me &quot;me&quot; in my definition is my viewpoint of being &quot;here&quot;.  I do
<BR>
not perceive that something acting like me over &quot;there&quot; can be me.  Until I
<BR>
perceive myself as being inside that other body, it is external to my
<BR>
experience of &quot;me&quot;.  It is outside my understanding of &quot;here&quot;.  You can
<BR>
convince the new copy that it is me.  But you can't convince the original me
<BR>
that it has transferred.  The best you can do is kill me before I object
<BR>
that I'm still over &quot;here&quot; and that the transfer obviously failed.  Why does
<BR>
your plan for transferring consciousness depend on killing me instead of
<BR>
convincing me of the plans' success.  All phases of your plan can be
<BR>
completed without killing the original, and yet you require that the
<BR>
original be killed before this illusion will work.
