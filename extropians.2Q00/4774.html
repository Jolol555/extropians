<EM>&gt; antitrust legislation merely changes the market to one where it evolves

<EM>&gt; up their competitors. In an anarchy, everyone will be armed, so nobody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has a monopoly on force, and nobody can force others to their bidding.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, here I am, stuck in the middle again. Oh, well.
<BR>
<P>In a pure anarchy everyone can resort to force, so a free market can not
<BR>
operate. Instead, groups of thugs will band together to disarm and prey upon
<BR>
less aggressive individuals. Groups of concerned citizens will then band
<BR>
together for mutual protection from the thugs. These armed groups can easily
<BR>
overcome any resistance an armed individual can offer, so most individuals
<BR>
will join one in order to protect their freedom. But once that happens the
<BR>
groups become big enough to need organized leadership, and what you have is
<BR>
essentially a lot of tiny little states. From there it usually only takes a
<BR>
few generations for the little states to merge into a few big ones, and
<BR>
you're right back where you started.
<BR>
<P>In a more advanced conception of anarchy, with PPAs and privately produced
<BR>
law, you actually start out at the second stage of the reversion to statism.
<BR>
You can wrap them up in all kinds of paper protections, but ultimately none
<BR>
of it means any more than a paper constitution - the natural tendency is for
<BR>
the groups that specialize in violence to mutate into full-fledged states,
<BR>
and market mechanisms are inherently incapable of stopping this decline.
<BR>
<P>Now, history does suggest that a population which vigilantly guards its
<BR>
freedom can resist this decline. However, the evidence also indicates that
<BR>
it is unrealistic to expect such vigilance to last more than a generation or
<BR>
two. After a few decades people begin to forget that freedom isn't something
<BR>
that happens all by itself. Then private spending on weapons and training
<BR>
declines, public opposition to the growth of government is replaced by
<BR>
support for nice-sounding legislation, and the stage is set for the rebirth
<BR>
of big government.
<BR>
<P>In practice, I think the best course is simply to make government as small,
<BR>
as weak, and as well-designed (in the sense of resistant to changes that
<BR>
would make it grow) as possible. With a bit of care it seems feasible to
<BR>
handle everything that is now done by state and local governments through
<BR>
voluntary market mechanisms (including a market for good local governments).
<BR>
Only a few high-level tasks (like policing the interactions between local
<BR>
governments) have to be centralized in a traditional state, and these
<BR>
functions are relatively resistant to the forces that typically drive the
<BR>
growth of the state.
