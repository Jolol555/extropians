<P><EM>&gt; I wonder what would happen if you organized a &quot;party/poster&quot; conference
</EM><BR>
<P>A very appealing idea.
<BR>
<P>Clearly, in the ordinary party setting, only those present for the
<BR>
discussion get to hear what is said and contribute.  By preserving the gist
<BR>
on whiteboard or paper, the ideas become available to be worked on by all.
<BR>
An elegant, almost embarrassingly obvious way of enhancing the event.
<BR>
<P>The holding of a conference in a semi-posh setting--hotel with meeting
<BR>
rooms and catered dinners--is familiar as the conventional &quot;way it is
<BR>
done&quot;.   It needs no rocket scientist to conceive of alternative, less
<BR>
expensive, ways of accomplishing the same end.  On motorcycle rides through
<BR>
the hills of the California central coast (not all that far from Asilomar,
<BR>
in fact), I have often stumbled upon underused rustic park facilities which
<BR>
could easily accomodate a campout/cookout variation of the conventional
<BR>
conference, some even with substantial accomodations and meeting halls.  I
<BR>
am certain that the various list members know of similar facilities in each
<BR>
of their various locales.  This is doable on the cheap and on the cheaper.
<BR>
In fact, taking it to something of an extreme, the cost can be so low in
<BR>
terms of food and lodging, that even the expense of bringing special
<BR>
friends from faraway (and not so faraway) places might be subsidized at not
<BR>
unreasonable expense.
<BR>
<P>I play volleyball in Golden Gate Park nearly every Sunday afternoon with a
<BR>
group which calls itself the San Francisco International Volleyball
<BR>
Club--we have people from every corner of the globe.  The organizer of the
<BR>
group arranges for three and four day trips to various places, from a
<BR>
rustic YMCA camp in the Mendocino redwoods, to resort homes in Hawaii and
<BR>
Puget Sound and Monterey.  Total cost for these outings run from $75 (the
<BR>
YMCA camp) up to $500 (airfare to Hawaii), but average about  $160.  (The
<BR>
upcoming July 4th Squaw Valley trip is 5 days 4 nights for $167.)  How does
<BR>
that compare, costwise--no criticism intended-- to the recent Foresight
<BR>
gathering?
<BR>
<P>What it takes more than anything is the will, some leadership, some
<BR>
cooperation, and a modicum of organization.  But it's a great idea.
<BR>
<P>Before I put this post to rest, one last comment.  As enthralled by these
<BR>
futurist events as I am, I have entertained the idea of taping them
<BR>
prefessionally and packageing them for wider media distribution--the Extro
<BR>
TV idea.  (I pitched this idea to the Alcor folks re the upcoming Life
<BR>
Extension conference, but they turned me down.)  This same possibility
<BR>
exist re the independently organized retreat/seminar/party/poster event.
<BR>
Though it certainly ratchets up the amount of &quot;work&quot;, it also offers an
<BR>
opportunity for subsidizing splendid little vacations in some of the
<BR>
world's nicest resort locations while spreading futurist memes.
<BR>
<P>Unhatched chickens are always plump, tasty, and abundant.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
