<EM>&gt; &gt; Aha! So we Biotify the solar system and then much of the rest of the milky 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; way galaxy, so that maybe life (brain-life) evolves? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly. What I want is more diversity - brain-life would be a nice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bonus, but I would be happy if we could get just a few biospheres as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strange as the Earth's.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but we haven't resolved the question of *when* a simulation
<BR>
of a biosphere may in fact be more efficient than the biosphere
<BR>
itself.  Compress all the redundant data in physical bodies, encode
<BR>
lots of biochemistry in compact object-processes and run the whole
<BR>
thing on a big computer.  I bet sim-life beats nat-life in terms
<BR>
of optimal use of matter and energy.  The only question becomes
<BR>
how importantchaos is to evolution and whether you can effectively
<BR>
insert that into the simulation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  Planet Mercury would as Sir Arthur C. Clarke noted in Rendevouz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with Rama, that &quot;with Mercury, the lack of minerals, for humanity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could be fore-stalled a thousand years&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which makes it ideal for testing out a technobiosphere. Unfortunately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think Robert wants it too for some of his Matrioshka brains... :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I want it all, but I'm willing to share if rational arguments
<BR>
for that are made.  Lately though, I've been working on a scheme for
<BR>
the rapid dismantlement of Jupiter.  I may even be able to do Jupiter
<BR>
faster than I could do Mercury.  If so, I'm willing to donate it
<BR>
for technobio-experimentation for a few thousand years.
<BR>
<P>It is worth noting that given singularity nanotech growth rates,
<BR>
Clarke's statement is incorrect.  We run out of materials in a
<BR>
much shorter time than a thousand years unless we do star-lifting.
<BR>
<P>Of course if Amara would stop studying all that silly dust (I mean
<BR>
after all, who wants to run around the entire solar system collecting
<BR>
it all to do something useful with it???) and focus instead on finding
<BR>
the nearest brown dwarfs so we could do some serious targeting for our
<BR>
interstellar intellinanobot computronium conversion project, I'd
<BR>
be willing to leave the solar system and all the funky planets to the
<BR>
stay-at-home luddites.  That may be what we end up having to do anyway
<BR>
if most people don't soon develop a strong desire to self-evolve.
