<P>
(I changed the subject heading so this would be visible in this massive
<BR>
group of posts.)
<BR>
<P>&lt;RANT MODE ON&gt;
<BR>
<P>Speaking of the unhealthy American binge for high-glycemic carbohydrates,
<BR>
one of the worst is sugar. There is a potential alternative in a plant
<BR>
substance called stevia, but do a subject search on the net for stevia to
<BR>
see how it was blocked by bureaucracy and money politics.
<BR>
<P>Stevia has been used by South American Indians for hundreds of years as a
<BR>
sweetener. It currently has about 40% of the sweetener market in Japan and
<BR>
is also used widely in Europe. It's hundreds of times sweeter than sugar,
<BR>
but has essentially no calories. It doesn't degrade when heated, so it can
<BR>
be used for cooking. It has the potential to be a powerful tool in building
<BR>
a diet that avoids blood insulin spikes.
<BR>
<P>U.S. food processors were starting to look at it in the 1980's for use in
<BR>
their products, but the makers of NutriSweet reportedly saw a potential
<BR>
threat to their market and &quot;influenced&quot; the FDA to have it banned until it
<BR>
was &quot;proven safe&quot;. (NutriSweet which is considered &quot;safe&quot; has had more
<BR>
reported cases of adverse effects than any other non-prescription substance.
<BR>
When heated it degrades to something chemically resembling formaldehyde.)
<BR>
Since stevia is unpatentable, no one is going to spend 3 or 4 hundred
<BR>
million jumping through FDA hoops. The Reform Act of 1994 that cut some of
<BR>
the FDA's power so they couldn't keep it out any longer as a food
<BR>
supplement, but it can't be used in other products because the FDA then
<BR>
classifies it as a food additive, where they still have unrestrained power.
<BR>
If any marketer advertises the fact that stevia is a sweetener, the FDA
<BR>
stormtroopers pounce.
<BR>
<P>A while ago someone had a website that facilitated political action. It had
<BR>
a half dozen sample letters protesting Federal seizure of property without
<BR>
due process. It let the user choose a letter, modify it if he wanted, and
<BR>
click a few buttons to send an e-mail to his Congressman and Senators-really
<BR>
a neat tool. It would be great to have something like that to put some heat
<BR>
of the FDA. The revolving door that the military and their contractors used
<BR>
to have was closed. I think a military officer has to wait five years after
<BR>
leaving the military before taking a position with a contractor. The
<BR>
revolving door between the FDA and the pharmaceutical companies is swinging
<BR>
freely. That should be stopped. And if a Congressional investigation showed
<BR>
personal conflicts of interest by FDA administrators regarding stevia,
<BR>
perhaps they would be stripped of some more of their power. I think that
<BR>
would be very helpful for a number of Extropian goals.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Its not as if the entire US population suddenly mutated in the last two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decades
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; separate from the rest of humanity. There are significant reasons why
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; weight and rate of obesity is so high here, and its not medical. Part of
</EM><BR>
its
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; corn-fed diet, part is that Americans watch more TV than anyone else,
</EM><BR>
and we
<BR>
<EM>&gt; get the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; least exercise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am convinced that corn is very bad, and I have thrown out my pop corn
</EM><BR>
maker.
<BR>
<P>Now get rid of your cereals, breads, crackers, and any other majority
<BR>
source of starch type carbohydrates.
