Two nuns went out of their convent to sell cookies. One of them is known as
<BR>
Sister Mathematical (SM) and the other one is known as Sister
<BR>
Logical (SL).  It is getting dark and they are still far away from the
<BR>
convent.
<BR>
SL: Have you noticed that a man has been following us for the past
<BR>
half-hour?
<BR>
SM: Yes, I wonder what he wants.
<BR>
SL: It's logical. He wants to rape us.
<BR>
SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most.  What
<BR>
can we do?
<BR>
SL: The only logical thing to do of course is to walk faster.
<BR>
SM: It's not working.
<BR>
SL: Of course it's not working. The man did the only logical thing.  He
<BR>
started to walk faster too.
<BR>
SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in one minute.
<BR>
SL: The only logical thing we can do is split. You go that way and I'll go
<BR>
this way. He cannot follow us both.
<BR>
So the man decided to follow Sister Logical. Sister Mathematical arrives at
<BR>
the convent and is worried what has happened to Sister Logical. Then Sister
<BR>
Logical arrives.
<BR>
SM: Sister Logical! Thank God you are here! Tell me what happened!
<BR>
SL: The only logical thing happened. The man couldn't follow us both, so he
<BR>
followed me.
<BR>
SM: Yes, yes! But what happened then?
<BR>
SL: The only logical thing happened. I started to run as fast as I could and
<BR>
he started to run as fast as he could.
<BR>
SM: And?
<BR>
SL: The only logical thing happened. He reached me.
<BR>
SM: Oh, dear! What did you do?
<BR>
SL: The only logical thing to do. I lifted my dress up.
<BR>
SM: Oh, Sister! What did the man do?
<BR>
SL: The only logical thing to do. He pulled down his pants.
<BR>
SM: Oh, no! What happened then?
<BR>
SL: Isn't it logical, Sister? A nun with her dress up can run faster than a
<BR>
man with his pants down........
<BR>
<P>(And you thought it would be dirty! Say two 'Hail Mary's'.....)
