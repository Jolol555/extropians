<EM>&gt;           &gt;Bell's Inequality ? I have not heard of this, brief explaination ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When a photon of undetermined polarization hits a polarizing filter there is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 50% chance it will make it through. For many years physicists who disliked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the idea that God played dice with the universe figured there must be a hidden
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; variable inside the photon that told it what to do. By &quot;hidden variable&quot; they meant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something different about that particular photon that we just don't know about.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They meant something equivalent to a lookup table inside the photon that for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one reason or another we are unable to access but the photon can when it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wants to know if it should go through a filter or be stopped by one. We now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand that is impossible. In 1964 (but not published until 1967) John Bell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showed that correlations that work by hidden variables must be less than or equal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to a certain value, this is called Bell's inequality. In experiment it was found that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some correlations are actually greater than that value. Quantum Mechanics can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explain this, classical physics or even classical logic can not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even if Quantum Mechanics is someday proven to be untrue Bell's argument is still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; valid, in fact his original paper had no Quantum Mechanics in it; his point was that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any successful theory about the world must explain why his inequality is violated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll try to show how to find the inequality, show why it is perfectly logical, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demonstrate that nature refuses to be sensible and just doesn't work the way you'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think it should.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>snipped
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The bottom line of all this is that there can not be something special about a specific photon,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some internal difference, some hidden variable that determines if it makes it through a filter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or not. Thus the universe is either non-deterministic or non-local, that is, everything influences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything else and does so without regard for time or space. One thing is certain,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever the truth is it's weird.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well if the universe is really a huge matrix-like simulation at the
<BR>
quantum level, why can't the photon and polarizing filter just &quot;flip
<BR>
a coin&quot; when they interact and then proceed from there? That would make
<BR>
it pretty easy. Thanks for your explanation.
