<EM>&gt;From: Lee Daniel Crocker &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lee@piclab.com?Subject=Re:%20Gardening%20is%20Extropian%20(was)%20Are%20you%20an%20extropian?%20Re:%20Voluntary%20simpl...&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000609173105.78649.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">lee@piclab.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Why will you not concede the point: you may consider yourself an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if you agree with the principles (and in my opinion follow them). You 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not an Extropian if you cannot do that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That's a silly tautology: &quot;I define X as people who believe Y, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who don't believe Y are not X&quot;.  So what?  The opposition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;isn't arguing that, though they might think they are.  What they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really arguing is one of (a) The use of words to identify things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should be less rigorous than set theory in some contexts; (b) the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;set of people who believe Y really /ought/ to believe Y', so the word
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;X should refer to Y'-believers as well; (c) while belief in Y is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;common among those calling themselves X, it's really a consequence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of those people having condition Z (which may or may not include
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beliefs), so we ought to use X to refer to Z-people, most of whom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also happen to believe in Y, but not necessarily; (d) Y itself is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so imprecisely defined that some people we don't think are X might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually be X after all, because their vision of Y is clearer.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  While we may all be able to agree on the meaning of the terms 
<BR>
&quot;entropy&quot; and its opposite, &quot;extropy&quot;, I think the term &quot;extropian&quot; is 
<BR>
subject to more debate.  One person might (reasonably) claim that you are 
<BR>
not extropian unless you live by the stated principles of ExI.  Another 
<BR>
person might (just as reasonably) claim that you are extropian if you are 
<BR>
merely opposed to the increase of entropy.
<BR>
<P>I'm currently reading a history of the US Civil War and its political 
<BR>
preludes, and it is interesting to see how much those who considered 
<BR>
themselves as &quot;Republicans&quot; in the mid-19th Century would differ politically 
<BR>
from those who today call themselves &quot;Republicans&quot;.  Yet there would be *no* 
<BR>
disagreement between them on the definition of the word &quot;republic&quot;.
<BR>
<P><P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
