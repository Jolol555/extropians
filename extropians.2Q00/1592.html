<EM>&gt; Sounds like a bit of trouble.

<EM>&gt; Gee, maybe if the english got the hell out of where they don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; belong they wouldn't have these problems....
</EM><BR>
<P>Clue #1: it isn't the English in northern Ireland; it's the British
<BR>
Army. You're about four hundred years too late to fix Oliver Cromwell's
<BR>
big mistake, and now we've got to live with the consequences.
<BR>
<P>Clue #2: have you by any chance heard of a nice, friendly bunch of lads
<BR>
called the UVF? If the British government withdrew from Northern Ireland
<BR>
tomorrow they'd be only too happy to take over the policing job. In fact,
<BR>
you'd have a hard job keeping them from protecting the community by their
<BR>
preferred techniques -- the bomb, the gun, and the baseball bat.
<BR>
<P>(There used to be two communities in the Republic, only they had a
<BR>
little civil war in the 1920's. You might have read about it at school in
<BR>
history classes, if you'd been paying attention. Now there's only _one_
<BR>
community down south -- and their opposite number up north have long
<BR>
memories and hold grudges. It's not just the pIRA who plant bombs ...)
<BR>
<P>Clue #3: there are two native communities in Northern Ireland. They love
<BR>
each other so much that the mere threat of a British withdrawl is enough
<BR>
to give the government of Eire a panic attack; the aftermath of a British
<BR>
withdrawl without some sort of peace settlement would resemble Bosnia.
<BR>
<P>Now, would you like to explain exactly how your suggestion would result 
<BR>
in a successful resolution of the Irish problem? If you can convince us,
<BR>
then I suggest you will not find the Prime Minister and the Taioseach
<BR>
uninterested. (They -- and their predecessors -- have been looking for a
<BR>
solution for the past three decades, at great personal risk.) If you
<BR>
can't suggest a solution, may I submit that the smart thing to do would
<BR>
be in future to do your research _before_ you open your mouth in public?
