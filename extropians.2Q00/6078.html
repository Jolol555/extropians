<P>
Someone has forwarded me the material from the transhumanist list that seems 
<BR>
to have given rise to the &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; talk here and the personalistic 
<BR>
firefight that's erupted in its aftermath.  I don't think it would be 
<BR>
productive for me to try to get into a point-by-point response to the posts 
<BR>
on the other list or, for that matter, the specific posts that have been made 
<BR>
here.  Instead, I'll exercise whatever prerogative I may have as the 
<BR>
sometimes-sort-of list moderator and as an officer of Extropy Institute to 
<BR>
state my views on a fresh screen.
<BR>
<P>1.  Extropianism isn't anti-Semitic.  To me, the very notion is so absurd I 
<BR>
have a very hard time even imagining how any rational person could come to 
<BR>
such a conclusion or even harbor such a suspicion.  In fact, as wordy as I 
<BR>
am, I have a hard time mustering the verbal energy to respond to such an 
<BR>
idea.  As I've thought about this during the day today, I've considered 
<BR>
writing that this or that particular person who has been involved in 
<BR>
extropian activities is Jewish, or that one of my best friends and most 
<BR>
influential mentors is a devout Jew, or that one of the historical 
<BR>
wellsprings of the ideals of independence and autonomy that extropians value 
<BR>
is the Judaic tradition, all of which are true.  But such statements seem 
<BR>
hardly to express the revulsion I feel for the notion that the ideals and 
<BR>
values this community shares could be characterized as anti-Semitic.  
<BR>
<P>As I said in an earlier post, the reference to &quot;ZOG&quot; escaped me because I 
<BR>
simply don't know that much about the paranoid ravings of the particular 
<BR>
brand of fringe lunatics from which such ideas come.  The discussion of 
<BR>
circumcision I've seen here from time to time actually had little impact on 
<BR>
me - no offense to people who might feel strongly about it, but I just don't 
<BR>
buy that infant circumcision causes trauma: I don't see enough difference in 
<BR>
the lives of men who are and aren't circumcised to support such assertions, 
<BR>
so it seemed to me like a harmless preoccupation (something we seem to have a 
<BR>
little of in this community that has an amusingly high percentage of 
<BR>
entertaining eccentricities).
<BR>
<P>The bottom line is that it would take a lot more evidence than I've seen in 
<BR>
the posts I've read to convince me that there is a shred of support for the 
<BR>
notion that &quot;extropianism is anti-Semitic&quot;.  If this were a legal case and I 
<BR>
were the judge, I'd dismiss the complaint on the pleadings and seriously 
<BR>
consider a motion for sanctions by the defense.
<BR>
<P>2.  Extropianism isn't a cult.  Buried in amongst the verbiage of the 
<BR>
exchange leading up to the recent heat here was that old canard.  Again, the 
<BR>
idea is just nuts.  Anyone who's taken the trouble to read Max More's 
<BR>
expression in the Extropian Principles of the ideals and values we share 
<BR>
would have to see that these principles 1) encourage individual inquiry and 
<BR>
development; 2) discourage dogmatism; and 3) nowhere suggest the kind of 
<BR>
personal, hierarchical &quot;leadership&quot; that characterizes a &quot;cult&quot;.  Like any 
<BR>
creative and playful group of people who share the same ideas and values and 
<BR>
who have common cultural influences and experiences, we've got a little &quot;in 
<BR>
group&quot; jargon.  So does my regular backpacking group.  Neither is a cult.
<BR>
<P>3.  Some of the more prominent extropians, the mailing list and ExI sometimes 
<BR>
attract nuts.  Because we're exploring ideas on the edge of mainstream 
<BR>
culture and science, from time to time we have to deal with people who have a 
<BR>
tenuous grasp on reality.  People like Max and Natasha More and Ray Kurzweil 
<BR>
get interviewed in magazines and appear on television.  They talk about ideas 
<BR>
that sometimes attract people who have mental and emotional problems.  I've 
<BR>
seen the same thing happen with Eric Drexler.  It's a problem.  It's not 
<BR>
uncommon for such people to have delusions that these public figures are 
<BR>
somehow &quot;involved with them&quot; and to develop delusions of persecution.  
<BR>
<P>In fact, this is a fairly well-recognized syndrome of mental illness.  When 
<BR>
such people don't get the attention to which they imagine they're entitled, 
<BR>
they can turn nasty, or even dangerous.  I've seen some of the truly sick 
<BR>
things people have written to Max.  I've even gotten a few scary 
<BR>
communications as a result of my activities with ExI from people who 
<BR>
obviously have mental problems (and I don't look nearly as good on TV as Max 
<BR>
or Natasha).  It's a sad thing, but it's a fact of life for people in the 
<BR>
public eye.  (Hey, at least we don't have the kind of problems Madonna has!)  
<BR>
But this phenomenon doesn't have anything to do with the substance of our 
<BR>
ideas and the work we're trying to do.
<BR>
<P>4.  There's no transhumanist &quot;turf war&quot;.  The ideas we're developing are big 
<BR>
enough for lots of variation and diversity.  I happen to think that the 
<BR>
Extropian Principles imply a libertarian political philosophy.  I use that 
<BR>
word AS AN ADJECTIVE to describe the confluence and implications of certain 
<BR>
values regarding social organization.  In particular, I think that placing a 
<BR>
high value on individual human life leads one to value maximally open social 
<BR>
structures that work as much as possible on a &quot;bottom-up&quot; basis, that leave 
<BR>
as much room as possible for the exercise of individual autonomy and that are 
<BR>
explicitly premised on actual individual consent as much as possible.  I 
<BR>
don't know a better word for this than &quot;libertarian&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Other people who share an enthusiasm for key elements of the transhumanist 
<BR>
agenda may not value these things as highly as extropians do.  They're free 
<BR>
to develop a different approach to the idea that the human animal can be 
<BR>
transcended.  There probably isn't a &quot;One Best Way&quot; to a post-human future, 
<BR>
although I feel pretty strongly that we could make some choices that could 
<BR>
lead to some pretty bad ones.
<BR>
<P>5.  No one owns the word &quot;ultra-human&quot;.  During the day today, I finally 
<BR>
remembered the coincidence that Brian Delaney used the term in a post 
<BR>
immediately preceding Max's talk at Extro4 last year, in which Max used the 
<BR>
term &quot;ultra-human&quot;.  I believe Brian's post preceded Max's talk by some brief 
<BR>
period of time.  
<BR>
<P>During that time Max was so busy preparing for the conference, that he wasn't 
<BR>
reading emails (or at least mine).  I have the most serious doubts that he 
<BR>
was aware of Brian's use of the term before he gave his talk at Extro4, not 
<BR>
least of which because I know Max had been working on the talk for quite some 
<BR>
time before the conference and he wasn't reading the list in those days (and 
<BR>
thus I got stuck with list moderation duties, such as they are).  
<BR>
<P>Newton and Leibnitz independently developed the calculus.  I've always 
<BR>
thought that was kind of cool, that they both thought of it independently at 
<BR>
about the same time.  And maybe Francis Bacon really wrote Shakespeare's 
<BR>
plays (although I really doubt it).  So what?  Big deal.  Who cares?  
<BR>
&quot;Ultra-human&quot; is a neat word that does a good job of expressing ideas we're 
<BR>
interested in.  &quot;Transhuman&quot; is a great word, too, and I think Natasha's 
<BR>
research has shown that it's use stretched back farther than any of us had 
<BR>
imagined.  If Brian came up with it first, way to go, Brian!  But really, 
<BR>
it's no big deal.
<BR>
<P>6 &quot;PR&quot; matters.  Our ideas are attracting increasing attention from the 
<BR>
mainstream media.  The Internet makes our discussions here available to the 
<BR>
world at large.  Journalists and other opinion leaders will develop an 
<BR>
attitude about transhumanism from what they read here.  What the world at 
<BR>
large thinks about tranhumanism can and will have a big impact on the kind of 
<BR>
future we all get to (or have to) live in.  
<BR>
<P>Cracking jokes is fine.  Talking about controversial subjects is good.  But 
<BR>
exercising good judgment about how folks who aren't totally clued in to our 
<BR>
vocabulary and personal histories might interpret a wisecrack or an offhand 
<BR>
musing IS important.  Being sensitive to the mind-set of people who may not 
<BR>
have spent years working through the implications of nanotechnology or 
<BR>
genetic engineering or AI isn't that hard.  Likewise, engaging in endless 
<BR>
haggling over subjects that don't easily lend themselves to real resolution 
<BR>
doesn't necessarily move our agenda forward.  I know we don't all agree about 
<BR>
the value of diplomatic speech, but there is a ground of common sense about 
<BR>
what is and what isn't productive discussion that we ought to be able to 
<BR>
agree on.
<BR>
<P>OK . . . back to the wisecracks . . .
