<EM>&gt; &gt; but there are &quot;no plans to reimburse the legions of motorists&quot; who (some

<EM>&gt; &gt; 20,000 of them) had already paid the $75 fine....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ja that does bring up an interesting point.  If we have more enforcement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for profit such as this, then there is no possibility of returning the money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if the law is struck down, for there is no contractual agreement between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lockheed and the local government for reimbursement.  If the city did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decide to reimburse the fined drivers, the city would need to make up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the difference that has already been paid to Lockheed, so in that case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the innocent taxpayer picks up the bill for a silly law.  We need *many*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more examples of where innocent taxpayers are holding the bag for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; misguided legislation.  Then, perhaps there would be hell to pay for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such goings on in city hall.  Eh?
</EM><BR>
<P>It goes on all the time. Even up here, the city of Lebanon was paying
<BR>
severance settlements to THREE school superintendents at the same time
<BR>
that the school board had dismissed before their contracts were up. What
<BR>
we need are laws that state that such screwups should be the personal
<BR>
liability of the politicians who commit the fuckups.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It's down to the &quot;Who is watching the watchers?&quot; ... again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We do, BM, we must.  Now more than ever.  Now more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diligently than ever.  For a price, Im sure Lockheed can arrange a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contract to develop watcher watching technology.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>As well as technology to get around it....which I'm sure the top dogs
<BR>
will want in order to sheild themselves from the law, Again.
