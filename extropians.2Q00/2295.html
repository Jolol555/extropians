<EM>&gt; I didn't know this. I'm just a newbie to COM, etc, after all. How well
</EM><BR>
does
<BR>
<EM>&gt; MSMQ mix with COM? Do I deal directly with COM/ActiveX objects (ie: Com
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; object A sends a message to Com object B)? Or is it outside of the COM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; model, meaning that things get messy?
</EM><BR>
<P>MSMQ is intended to be used by COM objects, so it all works together pretty
<BR>
well. The only real problem is that it was designed with a C++ mentality, so
<BR>
it tends to be more complicated than it really needs to be.
<BR>
<P>The basic model is that you set up message queues in different machines, and
<BR>
each COM object 'subscribes' to one or more queues. Then and program on the
<BR>
network can send messages to any message queue, using the MSMQ COM
<BR>
interface. When a message arrives in a queue MSMQ generates an event that
<BR>
signals any 'subscribed' COM objects that there is a message waiting.
<BR>
<P>You can do some really neat things with the system, like sending messages
<BR>
when the network is down (they just pile up until the connection comes back,
<BR>
at which point they all get sent), or interfacing with other message queue
<BR>
systems. However, you have to write your own code to handle dead letters
<BR>
(i.e. method calls that can't be processed) and serializing data (a message
<BR>
body can be text, almost any primitive data type, a byte array, or a
<BR>
persistent ActiveX object, but it can't be a variant or an array of anything
<BR>
except bytes, so you end up having to do some work if you're object have
<BR>
complex parameters).
<BR>
<P>The best book I've seen on using this kind of setup is:

<P>I give it about a 5 on a scale of 1-10, but then I rarely rate anything
<BR>
above a 7.
