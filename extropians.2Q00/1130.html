<BR>
Hello All
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the Terrence McKenna (TM) obituary (although in my opinion its 
<BR>
characterization leans a little too heavily towards the classic Tim Leary 
<BR>
bio). I happen to believe TM's time-wave novelty model for predicting a 
<BR>
singularity was a somewhat flaky corner of an otherwise brilliant campaign 
<BR>
to empower everyday people to 'pull back the curtain and see the Wizard for 
<BR>
themselves', so to speak.
<BR>
<P>Although I am not a big fan of TM's decreasing novelty / I Ching hybrid 
<BR>
model, I am increasingly convinced that the point at which disincarnate 
<BR>
intelligence supersedes its developers in a meaningful way (ie. Vernon Vinge 
<BR>
theory)may, in fact, fall within a relatively small band around TM's date of 
<BR>
cataclysm (Dec 22 2012. 'Small band' loosely defined could be 0 - 50 years. 
<BR>
Anyone familiar with TM's writing care to convince me that this is could be 
<BR>
more than mere coincidence and that TM's model isn't just post hoc 
<BR>
application of formalized procedure onto an pre-existing ontological 
<BR>
phenomena?
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Brad

<EM>&gt;NEW YORK TIMES OBITUARY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;TERENCE MCKENNA, PATRON OF PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Terence McKenna, who so playfully and persistently pressed his message that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;psychedelic drugs are mankind's salvation that Timothy Leary himself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;christened him &quot;the Timothy Leary of the 90's,&quot; died on Monday at a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;friend's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;home in San Rafael, Calif. He was 53 and lived on the South Kona Coast of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hawaii.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The cause of death was brain cancer, said a publicist for his books.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;If psychedelics don't ready you for the great beyond, then I don't know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what really does,&quot; Mr. McKenna said in December in one of his last public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;speeches, at the Esalen Institute. Death, he said then, felt close.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mr. McKenna combined a leprechaun's wit with a poet's sensibility to brew a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;New Age stew with ingredients including flying saucers, elves and the I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ching. The essential seasoning was the psychedelic mushrooms that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transformed his life and that he recommended-in &quot;heroic doses&quot;-for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;virtually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everyone.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;He lived on the wild side of a wild generation. He dropped acid in San
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Francisco in the 1960's, smuggled hashish in India and searched the jungles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the Amazon for the magic mushrooms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;He told interviewers that he had smoked marijuana every day from the time 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was a teenager. In the 1990's, Mr. McKenna gained fame by delivering his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drug pitch to a new generation at nightclub &quot;raves.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;My real function was to give people permission,&quot; he said in an article 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;appear in the May issue of Wired magazine.  &quot;Essentially, what I existed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was to say, 'Go ahead, you'll live through it, get loaded, you don't have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be afraid.'&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In lectures, in recordings and in five books, Mr. McKenna made his case for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;illegal substances that many experts consider highly dangerous. He had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;grand theory: that psychedelic mushrooms are the missing link in the story
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of human evolution. Not until our primate ancestors began eating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hallucinatory psilocybin mushrooms, he contended, did they begin to acquire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human qualities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mr. McKenna, a lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard and deep-set eyes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also professed to know exactly when the world would end: Dec. 22, 2012. He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;came to this conclusion through a mathematical construct he based on the I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ching, the ancient Chinese book of divination.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The package he pushed struck a chord, at least among the usual suspects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead called him &quot;the only person who has made 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;serious effort to objectify the psychedelic experience.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But experts on drug treatment attacked Mr. McKenna for popularizing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dangerous substances. &quot;Surely the fact that Terence McKenna says that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;psilocybin mushroom 'is the megaphone used by an alien, intergalactic Other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to communicate with mankind' is enough for us to wonder if taking LSD has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;done something to his mental faculties,&quot; Judy Corman, vice president of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Phoenix House of New York, a drug treatment center, said in a letter to The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;New York Times in 1993.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Still others had big trouble with his self-consciously cosmic literary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;style. &quot;I suffered hallucinatory agonies of my own while reading his 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shrilly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ecstatic prose,&quot; Peter Conrad wrote in The New York Times in a 1993 review
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of Mr. McKenna's book &quot;True Hallucinations,&quot; published by Harper San
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Francisco.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But many marveled at his stream of novel thoughts. &quot;To write him off as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crazy hippie is a rather lazy approach to a man not only full of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fascinating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ideas but also blessed with a sense of humor and self-parody,&quot; Tom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hodgkinson wrote in The New Statesman and Society in 1994.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Terence Kemp McKenna was born on Nov. 16, 1946, in a Colorado cattle and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;coal town, Paonia. He was a youth given to  memorizing passages of James
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Joyce and reading Carl Jung's  &quot;Psychology and Alchemy,&quot; and his main
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;satisfactions percolated from his fertile imagination.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;I think my first encounter with psychedelics was looking at Colorado and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trying to understand that it was once the shores of an ocean with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hundred-foot-long sauropods tromping through the mangrove swamps,&quot; he told
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Details magazine in 1993.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;He found his way to San Francisco in 1965.  According to the April 1993
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;issue of Details magazine, Barry Melton, the guitarist for Country Joe &amp; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Fish, introduced him to marijuana in 1965. Soon he tried LSD.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;He enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley that year and was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accepted into the Tussman Experimental College, which emphasized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self-direction. After the two-year program, he embarked on travels around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In 1971 he and his brother, Dennis, journeyed to the Amazon jungle in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;search
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of psychedelic plants. In a tiny mission settlement in southern Colombia,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they encountered, for the first time, what drug enthusiasts call &quot;magic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mushrooms.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In 1972, Mr. McKenna returned to Berkeley to finish college. He completed a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self-tailored degree in ecology, resource recovery and shamanism. His mind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was focused on, and certainly by, mushrooms. No one had yet figured out how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to cultivate the mushrooms in the United States, but the McKennas brought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the South American secrets home. They published them, and in the 1980's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;growing 70 pounds every six weeks. The operation ended when a friend was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arrested for his fungi farm.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In 1975, the two brothers published their first book, &quot;The Invisible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens and the I Ching.&quot; Mr.McKenna began to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lecture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;both to old hippies and converts to the emerging New Age. According to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Wired, he drifted into the role of &quot;charismatic talking head.&quot; He wrote 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;four
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;books in the early 1990's. In addition to &quot;True Hallucinations,&quot; they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Food of the Gods&quot; (Bantam, 1992); &quot;The Archaic Revival&quot; (Harper San
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Francisco) and &quot;Trialogues at the Edge of the West,&quot; written with Ralph
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Abraham and Rupert Sheldrake (Bear &amp; Company, 1992).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mr. McKenna met his wife, Kathleen Harrison, in Jerusalem in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mid-1970's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They settled in Occidental, a small town north of San Francisco. They had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;son, Finn, who now lives in Jersey City, N.J., and a daughter, Klea, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Santa Cruz, Calif. He is also survived by his brother, Dennis, who lives in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Minneapolis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;After a divorce in 1992, Mr. McKenna moved to Hawaii, where he and his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;former wife owned property.  Mr. McKenna built a modernist house, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;topped with a huge antenna dish for the Internet communications with which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he became enamored.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Without sounding too cliched, the Internet really is the birth of global
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mind,&quot; he told Wired. &quot;That's what a god is. Somebody who knows more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you do about whatever you're dealing with.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When he fell ill last May, Mr. McKenna was enjoying a new life with Christy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Silness, a young woman he had met the year before at an ethnobotanical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conference in the Yucatan. He had medical treatment for glioblastoma
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;multiforma, a rare form of brain cancer, while friends and followers added
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more esoteric touches.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A self-styled &quot;grand kahuna of Polynesia&quot; biked up the mountain to meditate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at his bedside. A Nevada disk jockey, Art Bell, asked his 13 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;listeners to send good vibrations.  Wired said Mr. McKenna, like many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;others, wondered whether a lifetime of drug use might be to blame for his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;brain tumor.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;So what about it?&quot; he asked his doctors. &quot;You want to hammer on me about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that?&quot; They assured him there was no causal link. &quot;So what about 35 years 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;daily dope smoking?&quot; he asked.  They pointed to studies suggesting that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cannabis may shrink tumors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;Listen,&quot; Mr. McKenna told them, &quot;if cannabis shrinks tumors, we wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be having this discussion.&quot;

<EM>&gt;LOS ANGELES TIMES OBITUARY   Friday April 7, 2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;TERENCE MCKENNA: PROMOTER OF PSYCHEDELIC DRUG USE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Terence McKenna, a psychedelic pioneer, radical raconteur and passionate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;promoter of the mind-expanding powers of drugs, has died at 53.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;McKenna succumbed to brain cancer at a friend's home in San Rafael on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Monday. A student of shamanism, virtual reality and the botany of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Amazon, McKenna was a proponent of the use of psyilocybin, commonly called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;magic mushrooms, and believed human civilizations developed after early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hunter-gatherers accidentally ingested psychedelic drugs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;He doggedly promoted that belief, as well as the idea that warfare 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;developed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only after the original hallucinogenic plants began to disappear because of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;climatic change.  &quot;Our dilemma is that, halfway on the way to becoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;angels, we stopped taking our medicine,&quot; he once said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;His notions on the power of the drug experience drew a loyal following 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;among
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;members of the counterculture, including members of the Grateful Dead rock
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;band.  &quot;Most of us who have been involved in the psychedelic experience 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we had the discipline and rigor of Terence McKenna,&quot; Jerry Garcia, the late
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lead singer and guitarist of the Grateful Dead, once said.  &quot;[He's] the one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person who's made a serious effort to objectify the psychedelic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experience-and done  a good job at it.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;McKenna, who grew up in Paonia, Colo., moved to Los Altos, Calif., while in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;high school.  He attended UC Berkeley for two years and traveled 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extensively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;through Asia, Europe and South America before completing a self-tailored
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;degree in shamanology at Berkeley in 1975.  After college he made his 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dealing in Asian art in the East and as a professional butterfly collector.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;He expounded his controversial theories claiming that psychedelic plants,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most notably psilocybin mushrooms, were the key to the evolution of human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consciousness in books including &quot;Food of the Gods,&quot; &quot;The Invisible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Landscape&quot; and &quot;Psilocybin: The Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide,&quot; which he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrote with his brother Dennis.  Another title was &quot;True Hallunications,&quot; a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;narrative of spiritual adventure in the jungles of the Amazon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From his home base in Hawaii McKenna also founded and operated Botanical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Dimensions, a non-profit organization dedicated to the investigation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;ethnomedical&quot; and sacred plants.  He also established a gene bank of rare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;species near his home.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A celebrity on the Southern California rave scene of the early 1990's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;McKenna often appeared at all-night dance clubs where he delivered his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pro-drug message.  He also gave lectures in more formal settings, such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;UCLA's Wadsworth Theater.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;McKenna explained to a Times reporter some years ago why he got stoned a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lot.  &quot;My style of involvement [in drugs] is analytical and rational,&quot; he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;said.  &quot;Most people would think that that would melt the mystery away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That's not the case, actually.  If you keep a rational mind when you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;explore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the more peculiar edges of things, you will find odd possibilities.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;While calling for the legalization of controlled substances, he also noted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that they were not for everyone, including the immature or mentally ill.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Drugs are heavy equipment and you have to learn how to operate heavy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;equipment,&quot; he said.  &quot;We have driver's licences; we should teach people 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to operate drugs.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;He is survived by his longtime partner, Christy Silness; his two children,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Finn, 22 and Klea, 19; and his brother Dennis.

<EM>&gt;Terence McKenna, in Trialogues at the Edge of the Unthinkable (1998)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;I have talked before about shamanism anticipating the future. If you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pursue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these psychedelic  shamanic plants, you inevitably arrive at an apocalyptic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intuition. I think shamans have always seen the end, and that the human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enterprise in three-dimensional space has always been finite. In the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny as we look into the past, it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reasonable to assume that death, which we have spent a thousand years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;turning into a materialist vacuum, is in fact not what we think. There's an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enormous mystery hovering over our existence, that's only unraveled beyond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the grave.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;I would never in my life have thought that I would be pushed to this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;position. I spent the first half of my life getting away from this kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thing. However, the evidence of the shamanic hallucinogens is in fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shamans have always done what they do via ancestor magic and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;higher-dimensional perception, and that death is not what naive positivism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the last 300 years has attempted to say it is. I realize that it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incredible to suppose that here  at the apex of materialist, positivist,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scientific civilization, we're going to make an orthogonal turn into an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;understanding of what lies beyond the grave, but in fact, this is probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the paradigm-shattering world-condensing event that is bearing down on us.&quot;
