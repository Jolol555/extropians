<P>
The media have not reported (as far as I know) a beautiful swiss experiment
<BR>
about the superluminal quantum *influence*. This experiment has tested the
<BR>
s.c. *conspiracy* or *peaceful coexistence* between quantum mechanics and
<BR>
special relativity and has shown that such an *influence* (spooky action -
<BR>
or *passion*, or *fashion* - at a distance) acts with a velocity which is
<BR>
greater than 10^6 C (one million times C).
<BR>
<P>Whether or not such an *influence* is actually carrying some kind of
<BR>
information, or *is* itself the information (is quantum mechanics an
<BR>
information theory?), or is nothing but a distant quantum state preparation,
<BR>
or is supported by possible *preformed and non local* structures of quantum
<BR>
objects, are still open questions.
<BR>
<P>The experiment. Two entangled photons are emitted (in Geneve), one directed
<BR>
to a Franson interferometer (in the village of Bellevue), one directed to a
<BR>
Franson interferometer (in the village of Bernex). The geometry (Geneve,
<BR>
Bellevue, Bernex) is triangular and each side is about 10 kilometers long.
<BR>
When both photons reach these interferometers a (second order) interference
<BR>
pattern appears, violating Bell's inequalities and thus showing that *local*
<BR>
hidden variables do not exist. This interference pattern means that the
<BR>
dynamics of an entangled photon into the interferometer in Bellevue and the
<BR>
dynamics of the other entangled photon into the interferometer in Bernex are
<BR>
*identical*. Actually entangled photons behave *coherently* at very long
<BR>
distances. This is called the nonlocality (or nonseparability) problem.
<BR>
Nonlocality comes directly from: the superposition principle (entangled
<BR>
photons states are superposed in a singlet state); the s.c. *collapse* (when
<BR>
some *selective* or recordable measurement is performed) of the wavefunction
<BR>
describing the entangled photons superposition; the indistinguishability of
<BR>
the entangled particles; the wave-like nature of particles.
<BR>
<P>Now if we move, very fast, one interferometer (Bellevue) and-or the other
<BR>
(Bernex) we must take into account the special relativity. These relative
<BR>
movements can indeed lead to a tension between quantum mechanics and special
<BR>
relativity, so that the interference pattern could breakdown. That is
<BR>
because, due to the (relative) movements of interferometers, *each* of the
<BR>
two natural reference frames (Bellevue interferometer, Bernex
<BR>
interferometer) can realize that the local measurement takes place *before*
<BR>
the distant one and can also think that the state of the distant photon is
<BR>
knowable performing some local measurement (on the local photon). Of course
<BR>
if we perform measurements in regions which are space-like separated (no
<BR>
causal correlation) we lose even the lorentzian invariant way of determining
<BR>
which measurement was carried out first, but the experiment I¹m speaking
<BR>
about does not require this assumption. (Whether or not operators localized
<BR>
in space-like separate regions commute is an interesting question!).
<BR>
<P>In this context the term measurement means *collapse* (or sudden
<BR>
decoherence) of the wavefunction describing both entangled photons
<BR>
(singlet), hence a unique irreversible nonlocal process. This process is not
<BR>
dependent on any time ordering of measurements, because it is based on the
<BR>
superposition principle and on the indistinguishability of the entangled
<BR>
particles. We can also say that while this process is not dependent on any
<BR>
time ordering of measurements it could be linked to an absolute universal
<BR>
order of succession: the Bohmian *quantum aether* or some other preferred
<BR>
reference frame. So this quantum nonlocality could take us to a quantum
<BR>
causality principle, based on that preferred universal (cosmic) reference
<BR>
frame (and on the absolute time ordering of measurement).
<BR>
<P>Thus from quantum mechanics we get the following points: the measurements
<BR>
can create events which are simultaneously correlated (even in space-like
<BR>
separate regions); the time ordering of measurements is irrelevant; the
<BR>
relativistic causality is not necessarily a rule; the superposition seems to
<BR>
be the main principle and is based on the indistinguishability of entangled
<BR>
particles; the (second order) interference pattern is predicted.
<BR>
<P>But from special relativity we get: the postulate which says that the laws
<BR>
of physics have the same form in all inertial frames; the prediction which
<BR>
says that in space-like separate regions causality does not exist (no
<BR>
possible causal correlations); the postulate which says that the velocity of
<BR>
light *in vacuo* is independent of the velocity of the source; the necessity
<BR>
of some time ordering of measurements; the essentiality of the relativistic
<BR>
causality; the interference pattern breakdown prediction.
<BR>
<P>Experimental results show no evidence for a breakdown of the interference
<BR>
pattern. Is this a sharp violation of the relativity postulate which says
<BR>
that laws have the same form in all inertial frames ? The answer is this:
<BR>
actually the Hardy-Percival theorem has already shown that a quantum
<BR>
*nonlocal* process needs a preferred lorentzian reference frame.
<BR>
<P>Experiments also show that the quantum *influence* velocity exceeds 10^6 C.
<BR>
Is this almost infinite speed in conflict with relativity which says that
<BR>
the front velocity of a signal cannot be greater than C, and the group
<BR>
velocity of a signal can be greater than C (but the peak cannot overtake the
<BR>
front) ? Is this almost infinite velocity in conflict with the relativistic
<BR>
causality which says that the source cannot cause effects outside its
<BR>
forward light cone ? Answers to these questions depend on the meaning of the
<BR>
terms *influence* and *collapse* and also on the possible *preformed and non
<BR>
local* structures of those entangled particles.
<BR>
<P>Anyway it is largely accepted that if a *perfect quantum cloning machine*
<BR>
could create *identical* particles this machine could easily violate
<BR>
Heisenberg's (uncertainty) principle. The perfect knowledge of all
<BR>
observables (measuring many particles which are identical) could then allow
<BR>
an effective superluminal quantum signaling. But that machine unfortunately
<BR>
can not exist (there is the *no quantum cloning* theorem). So the
<BR>
*conspiracy* is back again ! A new old fashioned principle could be on the
<BR>
way (the quantum mechanics and relativity complementarity).
<BR>
<P>Since things are, at present time, so subtle, what about the very beginning
<BR>
of the story when - as Boltzmann once said, commenting on the entropy law -
<BR>
the universe was in a very unlikely condition ?
