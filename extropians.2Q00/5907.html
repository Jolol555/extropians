<EM>&gt; &gt; I am not an advocate for censorship - self- or externally imposed -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; even though at first blush it seems that way.  With the essay by Joy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and the favorable responses, however, is it wise to continue to feed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the flames?  Choose your word and phrasings wisely, so they say what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you mean - nothing less, nothing more.  Talk of &quot;raping&quot; a planet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; carries images that are unpalatable to even some of your fellows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Amen to that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is interesting to think about how much of this jargon is completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; joking or ironic, and how much is actually an ill-considered subtext.
</EM><BR>
<P>How can one help but to ridicule statements that are made in ignorance of the
<BR>
facts at hand? The posts yesterday about the connection between Kazinsky's
<BR>
primitivism and the anti-tech humanism promulgated at Harvard (and in US
<BR>
academia in general) pretty much explains to me why someone like Bill Joy could
<BR>
find so much credence in Kazinsky's writing: He had already been
<BR>
programmed/inculcated in this anti-tech humanist mindset in college. One of the
<BR>
interesting things, at least to me, that I think that nobody in the Bill
<BR>
Joy/Unabomber debate has noticed, is that the Unabomber's technique actually
<BR>
demonstrated the reverse of what Kazinski was trying to get across. He claimed
<BR>
that the death and destruction and ecological and human devastation was the
<BR>
result of technological society, when his bombs were extremely primitive,
<BR>
demonstrating that a primitivist society is just as capable of sowing death and
<BR>
destruction across the land.
