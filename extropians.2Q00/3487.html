<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; With big business we have the collective option of just saying

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; no, or just saying less.  And we MUST exercise that option.

<EM>&gt; &gt; even a competetive one, where every stoplight, every intersection, every

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use them to enforce whatever laws the community wants to contract them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to enforce. How is the business to make money? Why, they make the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; money by writing the most citations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But remember the enforcement businesses are bidding to create the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; largest amount of societal order and safety at the lowest cost, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you and I are the customer now.  The point of this whole exercise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is to *reinforce* the notion that the *government is here to serve us*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not the other way around.  We must constantly reinforce that concept,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since it slips away otherwise, and we become a society of slaves.
</EM><BR>
<P>But how do you quantify 'societal order and safety' in a way that does
<BR>
not involve traffic tickets or other punitive measures or fines?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If a private security company gets overzealous, then the citizenry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decides to demand lower fines for minor infractions.  If murder is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being perpetrated without the perps being caught, more security
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is demanded.  An equilibrium is established.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'd rather see it become a non-profit decentralized volunteer effort, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sort of digital neighborhood watch.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ill buy it, Mike.  But Im a little surprised (and pleased) to see such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a suggestion coming from you.  {8^D
</EM><BR>
<P>I always prefer local solutions. Being libertarian, or even anarchistic,
<BR>
does not imply that you think that everything ought to be derived from
<BR>
the profit motive. For example, I'd hate to have to base my membership
<BR>
fee at the gun club based on the number of bullets I expend...;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Palo Alto essentially has such a system now.  And as you might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expect, there isnt much crime there.  Regardless of how we vote,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such systems will spontaneously arise, for surveillance equipment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is cheap and small.  My 80 dollar wireless camera is already out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of date, being 5 weeks old and all.  This week the 80 dollar model
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gives you and infrared sensors and motion detectors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So what will happen when cameras are the size of marbles and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost 20 bucks?  Or the size of a BB and costs 5?  How soon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do you suppose that will be?
</EM><BR>
<P>I expect it to be relatively soon. I would hope though that the
<BR>
technology is used mostly to prosecute people for causing accidents. One
<BR>
reason I think the accident rate with cars is so high is that simple
<BR>
accidents are not treated the same as, say, any other sort of assault
<BR>
with a deadly weapon, or negligent/accidental discharge of a firearm,
<BR>
etc. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Conditions of no risk should follow the no harm, no foul rule.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Agree.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; When they do all their calculations off the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tables, and every insurance company is re-insured by the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reinsurance syndicate, where do you get lower rates?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Competitors would seek profit niches by using proprietary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; risk tables.  Example: those companies that specialize in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; motorcycle insurance.  Some years ago they established
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; almost zero correllation between risk and engine size.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ate the big guy's lunch.
</EM><BR>
<P>For how long?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; here's an example: Once, several years ago, for about 6 months, I drove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; around with no license.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why you rebel child you.  {8^D  Not that *I* would ever do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such a thing...
</EM><BR>
<P>I was NOT happy about it, beleive me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Capping what they can make will limit the enthusiasm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with which they will engage in law enforcement, but will result in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; large roving population of law enforcers at any given time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What do you think?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I dont know Mike, heres a lot of material in this post that I need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to think over.  Now I gotta run, out to Palo Alto to the nano/extro
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; schmooze.  spike

<P>Say hi to everyone for me...
