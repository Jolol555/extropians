<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Since when exactly was the level of taxation directly inversely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; proportional to how 'free' a country is? Unless one is arguing for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; system of no taxation and public services at all, the specifics seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat irrelevant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The specifics are entirely relevant.  First, the amount of taxation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; essentially determines how much of your labor is slave labor (adjusted for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rate of return, but that typically is pretty damn low).  Second, taxation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that is tied more closely to service usage is more fair than taxation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; based on other arbitrary metrics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [snip long, but very good example of (non)efficient tax usage]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was ambiguous. What I think I meant is that the specifics in terms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the percentile figures for taxation are not much use with no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consideration of how that money is being used (which can be well or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; badly, as you say).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Once you've decided to allow for some taxation, however (as opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; none at all, as Mike has suggested - and it is a vaild option) it makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very little sense to try and compare exactly how much freedom a country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has removed, via its taxes. There are simply far too many factors.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the fact is that Charlie is enslaved 40% of the time, while I am
<BR>
enslaved less than 16% of the time. Which of us is more free? Saying
<BR>
that the money stolen from Charlie by his masters is spent on his well
<BR>
being and other fun fun goodies is really irrelevant, because you don't
<BR>
know if Charlie actually wants everything the government is buying with
<BR>
his money and is telling him he needs. Considering that government
<BR>
generally wastes half of what it steals from its citizens, while money
<BR>
spent by citizens generates money in the economy, not only is it a
<BR>
benefit to leave it in my hands on a direct one for one basis, but also
<BR>
indirectly the extra growth in the economy not only increases eveyrone's
<BR>
income, but total taxes. Taxes here in the US are generally the lowest
<BR>
they've been for most people for a number of decades, at least on income
<BR>
tax. Other taxes have creeped up there, though, as I recall, last year
<BR>
was the first year that the Tax Freedom Day was earlier in the year than
<BR>
the previous year.
<BR>
<P>If the money a government takes from you is used in purchasing decisions
<BR>
you have no say in, then you have lost that freedom. If you could have
<BR>
used that money to attain greater financial security for yourself, there
<BR>
is more freedom that you've lost. Every tax dollar is a confiscated
<BR>
choice. It does not matter if its spent on guns or butter. If the choice
<BR>
is not in the hands of the citizen, then it is a lost freedom.
