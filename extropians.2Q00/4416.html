I don't ever watch TV except sometimes I tune in Mexico DF stations to
<BR>
improve my use of the Spanish language (we have a satellite dish); don't
<BR>
listen to the radio much.  So I'm not exposed to much advertising. I do find
<BR>
that when I go into town and see all the displays in the stores I get urges
<BR>
to buy all sorts of stuff that I don't really need.  What helps me resist
<BR>
this is that my house is very small, and I remind myself that whatever I buy
<BR>
is one more thing I have to make room for.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From my own experience and from what I've read, I've concluded that cutting
</EM><BR>
down on stress is one of the most life-prolonging things a person can do.
<BR>
There's no doubt that abject poverty is stressful, but for many people
<BR>
there's a far distance between their present level of income and abject
<BR>
poverty.
<BR>
<P>Here's something that's surprised me:  My annual income dropped from 6
<BR>
figures to 4 when I changed my lifestyle.  And yet I'm still able to spend
<BR>
about the same amount of money on fun things now as I was then.  The
<BR>
expensive house and car, the fancy clothes, the dinners in expensive
<BR>
restaurants, the nights in high-dollar hotels all had to go.  But these were
<BR>
not things that gave me any real pleasure.  For me the really fun things are
<BR>
books, music, plants for my garden, computer toys, and these I can still
<BR>
have, along with much more time to enjoy them.

<EM> &gt; I have undertaken a LBYM (live below your means) lifestyle for the

<EM> &gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I am currently pursuing a more advanced state of what could be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; termed &quot;voluntary simplicity&quot; in pursuit of this goal.
</EM><BR>
<P>This seems to be a common theme amongst recent messages (re: altamira's
<BR>
introduction message for example).  I wonder if it's a common lifestyle
<BR>
throughout this community?
<BR>
<P>Recently I've been watching the behavior of a relative of mine who's been
<BR>
going through a marital separation which is putting a bit of financial
<BR>
pressure on her.  She's a typical suburban American with stereotypical
<BR>
motivations far as I can see; she comes home from work and plops down in
<BR>
front of the TV for the evening, has the usual credit card debt, car loan,
<BR>
etc.  She's never not been in debt, yet she's not in real trouble, she can
<BR>
manage what she has.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From one conversation to the next her position on financial matters
</EM><BR>
changes.
<BR>
She'll be worried about money one day, and the next she'll be mentally
<BR>
shopping
<BR>
for new cars - this despite the aforementioned financial pressure.
<BR>
<P>It made no sense to me 'till one evening I myself was watching the tube,
<BR>
and started taking note of just how many of the commercials I was watching
<BR>
were ads for cars.  It's about 40% during evening TV by my
<BR>
crude measurements.   The result seemed straightforward to me: if you
<BR>
spend most of your free time watching targeted messages telling you
<BR>
to buy something, you'll find yourself wanting to do so.  (if I watch
<BR>
enough TV I find myself fantasizing about, oh, say, a new 'Vette.. some
<BR>
things _are_ worth the money :-))
<BR>
<P>For myself, I've almost always lived below my means - not necessarily
<BR>
simply (I live in Manhattan and have the usual toys in my apartment,
<BR>
though the stereo is 11 yrs old - my vice is expensive bicycles..)
<BR>
and not necessarily by a conscious choice to do so - I just don't
<BR>
feel motivated to acquire the costly baggage most people have, so my
<BR>
expenses
<BR>
are low relative to many people around me.  (you know, those Wall
<BR>
Street yuppies!).  I don't value big houses or fancy cars - at least,
<BR>
not at the levels that the general population appears to.  In fact, I
<BR>
find that posessions almost make me nervous - it's _stuff_ that I have
<BR>
to take care of - if I want to travel, or take a job in another city, or
<BR>
whatever, I have to move this _stuff_ around or make it go away somehow.
<BR>
The more I think about it, the more I value freedom - physical,
<BR>
get-up-and-go
<BR>
freedom, and positive numbers in my accounts.  And I can always buy stuff
<BR>
with those positive numbers, if I want.
<BR>
<P>I wonder if extropians have resistance to consumerist memes, if only because
<BR>
we pay attention to information sources other than consumerist media?
