Mike: 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The average high school graduate in 1920 was more literate than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  typical college graduate today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>That's why the appeal of the Harry Brown book TOTALLY lost me ... hearken to 
<BR>
a better life back then... How good life was before it all got interfered 
<BR>
with by those darn civl rights laws. Hogwash.
<BR>
People are always going to whitewash the past. Remember how much better is 
<BR>
was ...? ... back in another time, a better, simpler America?  That rhetoric 
<BR>
only works if I lived in middle class, non-ethnic, as white male America, 
<BR>
Mike.  Things weren't so good for &quot;others&quot;.  Others have it better now, but 
<BR>
not much -- oh yes, and at a cost to the middle class non-ethnic, white male 
<BR>
America. 
<BR>
I know you have heard this before and discount it, but it's my POV.
<BR>
<P>(snip)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  the lesser of two evils. By aborting, shes making sure there are fewer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  people like her (and the father) in the world. Abortion and execution: I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  just call it evolution in action.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is a rational point of view. Cold hearted, a little stubbornly 
<BR>
impersonal, but rational. Actually I can add on to that. An accidental mother 
<BR>
who is not &quot;unfit&quot; can also observe the world as an &quot;unfit&quot; and not want to 
<BR>
raise a baby here. Is that anti-evolutionary?
<BR>
<P>Nadia
<BR>
<P>PS
<BR>
I Really liked you answer to my art post, and will write a reply as soon as I 
<BR>
have time to honor it in the way it deserves to be honored.
