<EM>&gt;Well, searching on the term &quot;missing 13th Ammendment&quot;, I came up with these 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;links:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      <A HREF="http://w3f.com/patriots/13/13th-01.html">http://w3f.com/patriots/13/13th-01.html</A>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(which are actually the same piece).  With respect, this material strikes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as paranoid hogwash.  The plain language and common-sense historical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;context
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems to indicate that this text was simply an example of anti-monarchical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;revolutionary rhetoric, mean-spirited aggression toward loyalists and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anti-British chest-thumping.  The interpretation this author puts on the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;text
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is right up there with the best &quot;black helicopter, New World Order, secret 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;UN
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;troops&quot; type lunacy.

<P>Well, here's the actual URL that I mentioned, which took some effort to 
<BR>
track down, as &quot;the Practice&quot; site no longer points to Cameryn's own site, 
<BR>
and her site has been commercialized and no longer mentions her brother's 
<BR>
site.  So, the site is <A HREF="http://faculty.lls.edu/~manheimk">http://faculty.lls.edu/~manheimk</A>
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, I really am not biased either way on the historical issue.  I 
<BR>
just thought it was intrigueing.  Professor Manheim does not seem to take a 
<BR>
position on the issue himself, rather including the same article that 
<BR>
appears on your site listings, but also contra material, especially a large 
<BR>
FAQ from someone who seems to share your general opinion, All under his 
<BR>
&quot;diversions&quot; heading.
<BR>
<P>I do find it rather grotesque, however, to make any claims to an 
<BR>
independent, impartial judiciary in this country, when the source of income 
<BR>
for many of the &quot;officers of the court&quot; is directly or indirectly tied to 
<BR>
succesful prosecution of defendants, leading to fines and/or siezures.
<BR>
<P>According to the Orange County Register a few years back, over half the 
<BR>
income of the local police departments came from siezures, in which, in most 
<BR>
cases, no person was ever charged, arrested or prosecuted.  The legal action 
<BR>
was taken against the property itself, using the absurd legal fiction that 
<BR>
the property itself was guilty of a crime.  This fiction, however, allowed 
<BR>
the police and courts to ignore the entire Bill of Rights, as no person had 
<BR>
been charged, although, of course, it was a real person(s) who lost the 
<BR>
property.
<BR>
<P>Then the person had to sue in the courts and PROVE INNOCENCE to get the 
<BR>
property returned.  Of course, they might not have the wherewithal to do so, 
<BR>
as their assets might be gone or reduced to the point of bankrupting them.  
<BR>
Also, the property was frequently sold at auction as quickly as possible.
<BR>
<P>A prominent female reporter went into one of the major state prisons as a 
<BR>
volunteer prisoner recently, in order to get a real picture of what went on 
<BR>
there.  Larry King (Larry King Live, syndicated talk/interview show) spent 
<BR>
several hours interviewing her and other prisoners in the women's section, 
<BR>
as well as guards, the warden, attorneys, etc.
<BR>
<P>The really shocking thing was that a high percentage of the prisoners had 
<BR>
never been to trial, or even had a single hearing before a judge.  Many of 
<BR>
them had been incarcerated for years without receiving a single hearing.  
<BR>
How had this happened?  Well, they had been assigned a public defender at 
<BR>
the outset.  (Often, THE public defender, as many counties had ONE attorney 
<BR>
to handle hundreds of &quot;defences.&quot;)  Their &quot;attorney&quot; waived the time limits 
<BR>
- there goes the right to a speedy trial - and then refused to take their 
<BR>
calls.  Can you say hapless?  Hopeless?  Helpless?
<BR>
<P>The local radio news - KFWB, I believe - in discussing the newest flock of 
<BR>
prosecutions in the ever-widening L.A. Rampart police scandal (joy upon 
<BR>
joys!) - happened to mention in passing that the U.S. had just passed Russia 
<BR>
as the country with the most people incarcerated in the world.  Actually, 
<BR>
this happened several years back, I believe.
<BR>
<P>Like, who needs black helicopters, etc.???
