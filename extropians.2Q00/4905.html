<EM>&gt; Perhaps this is a prosaic suggestion to something more imaginative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you might have been holding in your mind, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about recording ourselves using the suggestion I said some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weeks back? (Answering &quot;What does it feel like to be ME?&quot; at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regular intervals.) It conects backwards, but one can always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make committments to future selves at the same time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a way to see our own tracks through our own life-forest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Looking at one's life-tracks can be enlightening. It also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shows how the sum of every experience makes us who we are today.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the exact reason I keep a diary. For those who do not, I cannot
<BR>
recommend anything more highly. A month of life in which you have recorded
<BR>
your thoughts and the things which have concerned and affected you can
<BR>
be worth an entire year which you went through without, in my opinion. 
<BR>
<P>Even after just a short while, you begin to become more aware of the
<BR>
processes which shape you. You can probabably consider major events and
<BR>
changes in your life, and look at the different ways you thought about
<BR>
things - but I guaruntee you would be amazed to look back over some of
<BR>
the inbetween steps you may have forgotten.
<BR>
<P>Coupled with meditation (the two usually overlapping), it has brought me
<BR>
an incredible insight into not just myself, but others also. I'm
<BR>
surprised it didn't occur to me to mention here earlier, in fact.
<BR>
<P>I'd love to discuss this with others, and would be happy to share some
<BR>
advice on what I've found the best way to go about doing this.
