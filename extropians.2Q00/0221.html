<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, not that big.  There is an experimental 10^15 FLOPS system under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; construction now (for ~$100M, I think), so it should only take a decade or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so for that kind of power to trickle down to the ~$1M systems that AI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; researchers could actually get time on.
</EM><BR>
<P>At the Contact AI Symposium, Minsky pointed out the dozen or so
<BR>
&quot;schemas&quot; the eye uses to determine distance to objects.  The brain
<BR>
is very general purpose hardware that over time accumulates
<BR>
a variety of programs to accomplish specific tasks.  When you use
<BR>
general purpose hardware, it is going to be expensive and slow.
<BR>
<P>The optical neuronal pathway is doing a 1-100 gigaops (depending on who
<BR>
you read).  As the recent announcement (from France?) shows, once you
<BR>
clearly understand what that hardware is doing, you can put most of
<BR>
that processing capacity in a chip that was supposed to retail for $6.00.
<BR>
The trick will be modeling enough of the &quot;hidden&quot; algorithms that the brain
<BR>
uses, successfully enough that they can be coded in very tight software
<BR>
and hardware.  For example, at some level of approximation the architecture
<BR>
of computers today (L1, L2, L3 cache, swap space, hard disk, tapes)
<BR>
have equivalent functionality and greater capacity than human short term
<BR>
and long term memory.  Yet this only costs a few hundreds of $.  The cost
<BR>
of materials for a &quot;brain&quot; is only a few dollars, its the lengthy and
<BR>
laborious process of training the thing that makes it expensive.  Once we
<BR>
understand that training sufficiently and can make copies of it, intelligence
<BR>
is going to be very cheap.
<BR>
<P>Examples I can think of would be OCR and Voice Recognition software.
<BR>
Right now these are still done in software on general purpose hardware,
<BR>
but given the volumes, in a few years they will move into hardware and
<BR>
be very fast and very cheap.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be able to evolve small sub-components on more practical systems, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; putting it all together is a big problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, the interesting problem will not be the low level networks that
<BR>
&quot;run&quot; specific algorithms but the higher level entity that assigns
<BR>
relative merit to and chooses between the results being presented.
<BR>
Things like automobile crashes, would be a good example showing that
<BR>
even humans choose the wrong result from time to time.
