<P><EM>    &gt;So I'll live to 150 with skin cells that are &quot;pretty&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;(execpt where they are malignant), and with intestinal and stomach
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;cells that are &quot;pretty&quot; (except where they are malignant) and with
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;a very robust immune system (except where they are malignant).
</EM><BR>
<P>But after 93 divisions, 50% more than in a normal lifetime, there was still
<BR>
no evidence of an increase in malignancy. Ok the divisions were done in
<BR>
vitro not in an animal but I would think, perhaps foolishly, that if anything that
<BR>
would increase the likelihood of cancer occurring in the cells not decrease it.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;that is a *far cry* from keeping alive an organism over many years
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;(where background radiation plays a significant hazard).
</EM><BR>
<P>Good point but if they increased the normal background radiation by a factor
<BR>
of 60 or 70 while the cells divided 93 times in vitro and they still didn't get a
<BR>
catastrophic increase in cancer then that would eliminate that worry. I think.
<BR>
Anyway, it doesn't seem like a particularly difficult experiment but to my
<BR>
knowledge it has not been done.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Ever since Fossil's book, everyone has thought that &quot;aging&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; associated with telomere shortening and quite simply that is crap.
</EM><BR>
<P>It sounds like you're saying that there is no possibility telomere shortening
<BR>
has anything to do with aging, not in any way shape or form. Skepticism is
<BR>
always healthy in science but cynicism is not and I don't think the evidence
<BR>
can support such an extreme view.
