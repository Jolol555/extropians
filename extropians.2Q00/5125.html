</EM><BR>
<P>In this I beg to differ.  Reentry vehicles do not change much with time,
<BR>
they
<BR>
cannot be made to go much faster [without burning up]  The development
<BR>
that
<BR>
has made possible laser antimissile defense is... faster computers. 
<BR>
These
<BR>
make possible more effective feedback and control loops.  The lasers
<BR>
themselves have not changed that much, but the adaptive optics, which
<BR>
focus and guide the beams to a white hot point, are guided by computers,
<BR>
which get better and faster always.
<BR>
<P>Secondly, I suggest that these ABM systems cannot be easily defeated by
<BR>
massive redundancy [ever more warheads] because the laser systems can
<BR>
also
<BR>
be multiplied arbitrarily.  It will not be getting cheaper to store
<BR>
missiles
<BR>
and god knows it wont be getting cheap to launch stuff anytime real
<BR>
soon,
<BR>
perhaps not before nanotech, at which time we have a lotta new headaches
<BR>
to defend against. I do not suggest the world suddenly becomes safe once
<BR>
we figure out how to shoot down missiles...  {8-[  Life was so much
<BR>
simpler
<BR>
when we just had the good guys vs the commies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Example: There  has been a lot of talk about optical LASERS fired from airplanes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but if I just buy some paint at Home Depot and paint my warhead white you'll have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increase the power of your LASER about a hundred times.
</EM><BR>
<P>Awww, c'mon John, humor me just a little.  Do you really believe that
<BR>
those
<BR>
who dream up these systems have not anticipated this?  They know a thing
<BR>
or two about highly reflective coatings.  {8-]  spike
