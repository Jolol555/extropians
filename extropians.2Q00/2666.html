SOURCE:   'The Mail on Sunday' May 7 2000:
<BR>
<P>Dr Patrick Moore, the academic and renowned ecologist, was
<BR>
a founder member of Greenpeace, and later became its
<BR>
president. He helped to create the direct-action campaigning
<BR>
style which made the environmental protest group famous
<BR>
throughout the world. But now he is appalled by what it has
<BR>
become and in this searing attack he condemns the extremists
<BR>
who, he believes, have taken over Greenpeace, and the
<BR>
celebrities who have flocked to support the rainforests
<BR>
campaign ...
<BR>
<P><P>The great Green con-trick
<BR>
<P>by Dr Patrick Moore
<BR>
<P><P>For 15 years, as founder and director of Greenpeace, I was
<BR>
a leader in the most successful environmental pressure group
<BR>
the world has ever seen. I was a veteran of frontline
<BR>
battles against everything from nuclear waste to whaling.
<BR>
<P>We sailed our ship into the blast zones of US and French
<BR>
nuclear tests. We placed ourselves in the firing line of
<BR>
whalers' harpoons.
<BR>
<P>But having spent half a lifetime courting danger and arrest,
<BR>
I now look at the mainstream environmental movement that I
<BR>
loved and can barely recognise it. Why? Because it has
<BR>
abandoned science to follow agendas that have little to do
<BR>
with saving the earth.
<BR>
<P>Of course, there were always extreme, irrational and mystical
<BR>
elements within our movement but they tended to be kept in
<BR>
their place during the early years. Then in the mid-Eighties
<BR>
the ultra-leftists and extremists took over. After Greenham
<BR>
Common closed and the Berlin Wall came down, these
<BR>
extremists were searching for a new cause and found it in
<BR>
environmentalism. The old agendas of class struggle and
<BR>
anti-corporatism are still there - but now they are dressed
<BR>
up in environmental terminology.
<BR>
<P>What has been lost are the principles of the early
<BR>
environmental movement: that all campaigns should be based on
<BR>
valid research. We won public support because our protests
<BR>
were founded on logical, scientific arguments.
<BR>
<P>That has largely gone now, to be replaced by a policy of
<BR>
sensationalism, misinformation and never-ending conflict.
<BR>
<P>Activists would have you believe Amazonia and large tracts
<BR>
of my native Canada are being stripped bare by greedy
<BR>
multinational logging companies. The only way to save the
<BR>
world, they say, is to save the Amazon's 2,700,000 square
<BR>
miles of near impenetrable woodland.
<BR>
<P>Greenpeace says that in the past four years an area the
<BR>
size of France has been destroyed. William Shatner - Star
<BR>
Trek's Captain Kirk - came down to earth to narrate a
<BR>
National Geographic video saying: 'Rainforest is being
<BR>
cleared at the rate of 20 football fields per minute.'
<BR>
<P>They portray the forests as the 'lungs of the earth' -
<BR>
absorbing carbon dioxide and pumping out oxygen without
<BR>
which we would all suffocate on a mess of polluting hydro-
<BR>
carbons. But it is all nonsense. You could burn every
<BR>
forest in the world, never mind the Amazon, and it would
<BR>
have an insignificant impact on oxygen levels in the
<BR>
atmosphere.
<BR>
<P>It amazes me to see the movement behaving the same way over
<BR>
forestry - our most sustainable primary industry - as it
<BR>
did about nuclear war.
<BR>
<P>And into this heady brew came pop singers and actors,
<BR>
anxious to create a caring impression. I place the rock
<BR>
singer Sting in the same category as a lot of the eco-
<BR>
warriors. He has good intentions - but we all know what
<BR>
the road to Hell is paved with.
<BR>
<P>These celebrity campaigners were at it again in New York's
<BR>
Carnegie Hall last month for the 11th annual Save the
<BR>
Rainforest rock concert. Sting, Sir Elton John, Billy Joel
<BR>
and Tom Jones joined unlikely hands with Ricky Martin,
<BR>
Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder before a sell-out crowd of
<BR>
1,800. People in the front paid $2,000 for the privilege.
<BR>
<P>'When the trees are bulldozed, a way of life is destroyed,'
<BR>
Trudie Styler, Sting's wife and the driving force behind
<BR>
the Rainforest Foundation, told the audience. She also said
<BR>
the foundation would fund natives of Guyana to study law so
<BR>
they could fight their own battle to save their land: 'They
<BR>
want to know how to help themselves.'
<BR>
<P>But a growing body of opinion says the only people they
<BR>
need saving from are Mr and Mrs Sting.
<BR>
<P>Certainly, the environmental movement continues to campaign
<BR>
on many fronts that are backed up by science. Nuclear waste
<BR>
dumping at Sellafieldm excessive use of fossil fuel (and
<BR>
subsequent concern about climate change) and toxic
<BR>
discharges are legitimate issues.
<BR>
<P>I have a pragmatic view about people and the environment,
<BR>
however, we have to co-exist. There are six billion people
<BR>
in the world who require things every day for their survival.
<BR>
It is no good wishing that there were no people on the
<BR>
planet, which is what many of these new activists appear to
<BR>
want. I think we are as much a part of Nature as any other
<BR>
species.
<BR>
<P>With a group of other forestry experts I visited eight of
<BR>
Brazil's 26 states. We flew over the Amazon rainforest and
<BR>
met all the environmental authorities, the World Wide Fund
<BR>
for Nature and conservation groups. We studied satellite
<BR>
pictures of the entire area, and we found more than 80 per
<BR>
cent of the forest intact.
<BR>
<P>But if the rainforest was being destroyed at the rate critics
<BR>
say, it would have vanished ages ago.
<BR>
<P>So where do the statistics come from which supposedly prove
<BR>
we are rapidly advancing towards the total destruction of the
<BR>
rainforests? Basically, the figures are a sophisticated con-
<BR>
trick based on bad science.
<BR>
<P>What is happening is that land is being counted that is being
<BR>
cleared following a programme of replanting. It is not virgin
<BR>
forest. The same pieces of land are being counted over and
<BR>
over again. If you keep adding up these areas, Man has cut
<BR>
down 50 times the size of the Amazon already.
<BR>
<P>It is this cavalier disregard for scientific truth which has
<BR>
left me so disillusioned with Greenpeace. Other examples
<BR>
include the misguided assault on genetically modified crops,
<BR>
the admitted misinformation about toxic wastes on the Brent
<BR>
Spar oil rig, and the boycott campaign against Canadian forest
<BR>
products.
<BR>
<P>I spent years fighting for what I believed in, and felt that
<BR>
by about the mid-Eighties we had achieved the breakthrough.
<BR>
By them most people agreed with us. Big business and
<BR>
governments wanted to co-operate with environmentalists.
<BR>
<P>To me, at that point it is logical to make the transition
<BR>
to working with people to find solutions based on science
<BR>
and reason. Our cause had become mainstream. But, of course,
<BR>
that's not what the activists wanted, nor did it fit in with
<BR>
their political agendas.
<BR>
<P>Instead, we have an environmental movement that is run by
<BR>
people who want to fight - not to win.
