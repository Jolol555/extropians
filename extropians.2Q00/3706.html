<EM>&gt;How do you suggest conflicts between two people with different providers

Who owns the roads???  Whoever provides the roads sets the policy re 
<BR>
insurance - or can if they choose, and they probably will, as otherwise they 
<BR>
might either find themselves stuck in ligigation or without customers.
<BR>
<P>Historically it's worth noting that originally the traffic signals were not 
<BR>
enforced by the police.  Rather, they were put up at the behest of the 
<BR>
insurance companies, who wanted a clearer way to resolve disputes over who 
<BR>
was at fault.  You could run a light without risk of arrest, but if an 
<BR>
accident resulted and there were witnesses, etc., then you were liable.  The 
<BR>
current policy of arresting and/or fining light runners is purely a 
<BR>
money-making scheme by the various authorities.
<BR>
<P>Similarly, you might be able to buy insurance to drive faster.  Obviously 
<BR>
speed is a risk factor, but not an absolute one, witness the German 
<BR>
Autobahns.  Speed may kill more people, but so does wasting time, and time 
<BR>
preferences vary enormously, as does high-speed driving skill.  The 
<BR>
one-speed-fits-all law is actually extremely unjust to those people who can 
<BR>
or need to drive faster and would be willing to cover the additional risk.
