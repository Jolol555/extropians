<EM>&gt; A great deal of good.  It can rewrite its own source code, however
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slowly.  It can use the conscious thoughts as a brief adjunct to mostly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; autonomic processes.  It can run a lot faster on next year's hardware,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or convince IBM or some funder to buy you a lot more of this year's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware.  You can be sure that at least you've solved the problem of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence.  And you can write up a Sysop seed and put it on a CD and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hand it to Eric Drexler and ask him to run it on the first nanocomputer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thus reducing the window of vulnerability.

<P>If we were talking about 1 or 2 orders of magnitude I would agree, but six?
<BR>
A ten-minute conversation with the AI would take almost 20 years!  It would
<BR>
take many decades just to figure out whether it was actually
<BR>
human-equivalent or not, and even with the AI advantage it is far slower
<BR>
than any human worker.
<BR>
<P>I think 2-3 orders of magnitude is the limit of usefulness even for a
<BR>
research tool.  If it runs slower than that, you're better off ignoring it
<BR>
in favor of more tractable systems while you wait for faster hardware to
<BR>
come along.
