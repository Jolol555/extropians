When I was younger, I used to like to go to a foreign country whose language I didn't know, taking with me only a couple of changes of clothes and enough money to buy food &amp; lodging. I found that it was a good way to find, sort of, the essence of myself, apart from all my possessions and friends and my &quot;place&quot; in the society of which I was a part.

<P>That sounds really exciting!  I lack the courage or the &quot;faith in life&quot; to do such a thing.  I have a friend who slummed his way through latin america and had a great time.   I sometimes on a certain level think the whole world is like the 'ole United States. lol  I love to read &quot;National Geographic&quot; to be reminded that is not so.
<BR>
<P>you continue:

But I was always glad to return home. The thought of being in a foreign time from which I couldn't return is a bit daunting.

<P>Ahh, but you could either in mind or entire body be put into a simulation of our time! lol!  Now, that is not the Extropian way(big E) of moving upward and onward!  Seriously, I could see myself sometime after reanimation seeking out others from my time who live in an isolated community which has at least the outward appearance of my own time.  I would not necessarily want to stay there, but it would be a good place to relax and share with others who understand.
