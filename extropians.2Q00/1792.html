<P>
Last year we had some discussion of the pictures of the Mars region
<BR>
known as Cydonia, home of the infamous &quot;Face on Mars&quot;.  I suppose most
<BR>
people interested in the topic already know about this, but I just
<BR>
learned that new images of this region were released a few weeks ago.
<BR>
They are visible at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/4_5_00_cydonia/index.html">http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/4_5_00_cydonia/index.html</A>.
<BR>
<P>One of the main landforms which was missed in the earlier images was the
<BR>
so-called &quot;Fort&quot;, an oblong shape in the upper right of the &quot;City&quot; region.
<BR>
Some people felt that this area had some of the most tantalizing hints
<BR>
of artificiality in the old Viking pictures.
<BR>
<P>The new release includes two images which show the Fort very clearly:
<BR>
M09-05394 and M04-01903.  The first shows the left side, with a heavily
<BR>
cratered area and two semi-circular cut-out craters in the lower left
<BR>
side of the object.  The second shows the right side of the Fort.
<BR>
<P>It's an oddly shaped structure, like so many in the Cydonia region.
<BR>
Hoagland thought it looked a little bit like a rocket ship, with those
<BR>
two big craters being its engine exhaust.  To me it somewhat resembles
<BR>
a distorted Star Fleet logo.  But nothing about it shows any sign of
<BR>
being artificial.
