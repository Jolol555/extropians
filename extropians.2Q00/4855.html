<P>
<EM>&gt;At the policy level we will need global bans on altering the genes we pass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on to our children, and on reproductive human cloning. We'll also need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effective, accountable systems for regulating human genetic technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that may have some beneficent uses but could be dangerously abused.
</EM><BR>
<P>I confess that I have no idea what the Extropian line is on this,
<BR>
but I find it profoundly frightening. What is being suggested here
<BR>
is none other than a new eugenics programme, not unlike the eugenics
<BR>
programmes of earlier decades, in which control of human
<BR>
reproduction is taken by the state. The only difference is that
<BR>
whereas we can see that what was done in the past was wrong (well,
<BR>
some of us can...) the current trend towards state eugenics
<BR>
programmes appears to have as much support now as the old programmes
<BR>
did in *their* day. What will be next? Strict regulations about who
<BR>
may reproduce with whom, based on their &quot;rationally-determined&quot; idea
<BR>
of what would be best? Presumably not, but even so, this sort of
<BR>
regulation is the same sort of thing as that. Let individuals act
<BR>
upon their own best theories and take responsibility for their own
<BR>
actions, let knowledge evolve, don't impede the growth of knowledge
<BR>
by introducing yet more regulations, let alone global bans!
<BR>
<P>Here is an excerpt of a transcript of a keynote I gave last year,
<BR>
which touches on this:
<BR>
<P>You may think that infringing your children's autonomy is a
<BR>
necessary evil. But -- *don't* think it doesn't hurt them: that way
<BR>
lies madness. Please don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying that
<BR>
anyone *intends* to harm their children. We all love our children
<BR>
and want what's best for them. We so much want to help them that we
<BR>
sometimes feel compelled to take the decision out of their hands,
<BR>
because we can't bear to think of them suffering as a result of
<BR>
their mistake. But when we do that, we're infringing their autonomy
<BR>
and doing them wrong.
<BR>
<P>We have to remember that we're fallible human beings.
<BR>
<P>When you and your child disagree, you may feel quite certain that
<BR>
you are right. But -- think about it -- that's exactly how you'd
<BR>
feel if, in fact, you were wrong. So your feeling *doesn't* give
<BR>
you authority, any more than it would give your bank manager
<BR>
authority over your money [this is a reference to something I had
<BR>
said earlier].
<BR>
<P>You may have more knowledge and experience; but so does your bank
<BR>
manager.
<BR>
<P>If it's so obvious that you are right in those cases -- then why on
<BR>
earth can't you persuade your own child of that? As the philosopher
<BR>
William Godwin wrote, 'If a thing be really good, it can be shown to
<BR>
be such. If you cannot demonstrate its excellence, it may well be
<BR>
suspected that you are no proper judge of it.'
<BR>
<P>Let's look at some of the reasons parents give for overriding their
<BR>
children's wishes. But I want to look at this obliquely. These
<BR>
justifications are so familiar in the context of parenting and
<BR>
education that it's very hard question them. So I'll consider the
<BR>
*same* arguments, but in a slightly *different* context, to show why
<BR>
they don't make sense. Let's start with *good intentions*. We all
<BR>
have them, don't we! -- even those who force their children to go to
<BR>
military school -- but do good intentions make our actions right?
<BR>
<P>Between 1934 and 1976, the Swedish government forcibly sterilised
<BR>
62,000 people as part of a eugenics programme. The victims were
<BR>
deemed to be flawed. Some had scored low on IQ tests. Some had poor
<BR>
eyesight. Some were 'of gypsy appearance'! Some were young boys
<BR>
found to be &lt;GASP&gt; 'sexually precocious'! Some were sterilised
<BR>
because they were considered inferior parents (lucky I wasn't a
<BR>
parent at the time -- no doubt they would have had me under the
<BR>
knife before you could say *Untermensch*!) One priest had a young
<BR>
girl sterilised because she hadn't learnt her confirmation lessons
<BR>
properly.
<BR>
<P>BUT WERE THEIR INTENTIONS GOOD?
<BR>
<P>Yes! Bear in mind that at the time, eugenics was a mainstream view.
<BR>
Among educated people, virtually everyone subscribed to it in one
<BR>
form or another. In the 1930s, people thought that denying people
<BR>
the ability to have children was 'scientific', just like people
<BR>
*now* justify denying their children access to television on the
<BR>
basis of so-called 'science'. The Swedish authorities expected the
<BR>
outcome of the scheme to be *a better world*. And they were using
<BR>
the very best 'scientific' knowledge available at the time about
<BR>
*how* to make it a better world. They thought they were helping
<BR>
those they sterilised *too*, because an inferior person, who has
<BR>
inferior children would have an inferior life.
<BR>
<P>Of course, many of the victims didn't *agree*. They didn't think
<BR>
that they should be sterilised. But their opinions didn't count. The
<BR>
authorities thought they were doing it for the best, but with
<BR>
hindsight we can see that they were wrong. Are you wondering why I'm
<BR>
going on about all this? Are you thinking that nowadays we *know*
<BR>
that gypsies are not inferior, and so on -- so none of this could
<BR>
happen now? If so, you are missing the point.
<BR>
<P>A woman who was sterilised in Canada under a similar programme, in
<BR>
the 1950s, was recently awarded $750,000 compensation. A newspaper
<BR>
recently reported that 'An IQ test later showed that she was *of
<BR>
normal intelligence*.' Would it have been fine to sterilise her if
<BR>
her IQ had been less than normal?! You see why that's missing the
<BR>
point?
<BR>
<P>A decent attitude to human beings requires that *whether a person
<BR>
gets sterilised or not* does* not* depend on *your* opinion of
<BR>
whether he'd be better off sterilised -- but only on his!
<BR>
<P>You can have an opinion; you can inform him of it; sometimes you
<BR>
even have a duty to. But that's where your duty, and your right,
<BR>
ends. *If he disagrees* there is nowhere you can get the right to
<BR>
sterilise him.
<BR>
<P>By now, I hope, you can see what this Swedish history lesson has to
<BR>
do with parents and children. You don't reach the truth by forcing
<BR>
your will on other people.
<BR>
<P>What applies to sterilisation applies to everything else in life
<BR>
too. So what *should* we judge a proposed course of action by, if
<BR>
not by our good intentions or the intended outcome? What about
<BR>
judging it by its *actual* outcome?
<BR>
<P>'It never did me any harm', some English people say, to justify
<BR>
subjecting their children to the unbearable boredom, bullying, and
<BR>
buggery of the traditional boarding school. Wellä one has to wonder
<BR>
about such people. They seem to be in a pretty bad way to me! [But
<BR>
seriously], you can't know in advance what the actual outcome will
<BR>
be, can you? (Or are you claiming to be omniscient like God? )
<BR>
<P>More importantly, *by whose standards* are you judging the actual
<BR>
outcome? By the standards of the person involved, at the time?
<BR>
<P>If that's really so, then, as William Godwin pointed out, you must
<BR>
be able to persuade the person that you're right. Or are you judging
<BR>
the outcome by the person's standards *after* the event?
<BR>
<P>For example, an English parent might ignore little Winston's cries
<BR>
and send him off to boarding school. And by the time he is released
<BR>
from that 'vile servitude', Winston Churchill might be grateful to
<BR>
his parents for having forced him to go. Does that justify their
<BR>
action?
<BR>
<P>If a parent *beats* a child, and the child grows up and endorses the
<BR>
beating and does the same to her children, do you think *that*
<BR>
justifies the action? If so, then you would also justify lobotomy,
<BR>
or *any* cynical manipulation of the mind or brain that would leave
<BR>
the victim docile at the end of it!
<BR>
<P>Who should decide what will count as 'good' or 'bad' in a person's
<BR>
future? You?
<BR>
<P>Suppose you rob Captain Scott of his ship to prevent him exploring
<BR>
Antarctica; or you rob Marie Curie of her pitchblende so she can't
<BR>
discover radium. You may save their *lives* and so achieve a 'good'
<BR>
end by *your* standards. But you do it by destroying what *they*
<BR>
think their lives are *for*, and thereby commit an unforgivable
<BR>
crime against them (and as it happens, in those cases, against
<BR>
humanity too). Destroying other people's aspirations and life's
<BR>
dreams just to make *you* feel good is the epitome of immorality. As
<BR>
the philosopher, Immanuel Kant, said, it's *immoral* to treat a
<BR>
person as a means to an end rather than as an end in *himself*.
<BR>
<P>So how *should* we behave towards other people?
<BR>
<P>Well, part of the answer is, an action won't be morally wrong if
<BR>
everyone involved genuinely *agrees* to it. Because if they all
<BR>
think it the best course of action, *then*, if it *is* a mistake,
<BR>
it's *their* mistake as well.
<BR>
<P>It's *perfectly legal and moral* to sterilise people by the tens of
<BR>
thousands. As long as they want you to. But it's perfectly *ill*egal
<BR>
and *imm*oral to sterilise even one person if she doesn't want you
<BR>
to. Incidentally, notice how the very same act can be a wonderful
<BR>
thing when it's *voluntary*, but an *absolute obscenity* when it's
<BR>
involuntary. Another example is sexual intercourse. It's rape when
<BR>
involuntary. This distinction holds for *everything*. Medical
<BR>
treatment saves lives every day, yet it's illegal to perform *any*
<BR>
medical procedure on an unwilling patient for their own good. Unless
<BR>
they're a child of course. *Then* it's perfectly *legal* -- but is
<BR>
it right?
<BR>
<P>Is it right for us to override children's wishes?
<BR>
<P>What if, for all our *good intentions* and our *reasonable
<BR>
expectations*, we are *wrong* --just like the Swedish government
<BR>
was wrong, for all *its* good intentions and reasonable
<BR>
expectations?
<BR>
<P>So the Swedes made a mistake. So what? We all make mistakes and they
<BR>
were doing their best!
<BR>
<P>If you're a heart surgeon, you might, in an attempt to save a
<BR>
patient's life, do a risky operation with their genuine, informed,
<BR>
agreement. They might die as a result. That does not mean you did
<BR>
anything wrong. (Unless the death was caused by a scalpel you left
<BR>
inside the patient or some other negligent action on your part.) The
<BR>
patient *wanted* you to take that risk. There's a world of
<BR>
difference between doing your best and failing *with the person's
<BR>
full consent*, and doing your best and failing on someone *who
<BR>
objects to what you are doing*.
<BR>
<P>Parental coercion is *immoral* and *destructive* because it regards
<BR>
the child as an object, a means to someone else's ends, instead of
<BR>
as an end in himself.
<BR>
<P>In our culture, treating a human being as a means to an end -- as an
<BR>
object instead of a person -- is rightly regarded as the ultimate
<BR>
immorality.
<BR>
<P>The Swedes would have *agreed* with that, even as they forcibly
<BR>
sterilised people. How can that be? The Swedish government was not a
<BR>
tyranny. They just didn't recognise gypsies as human in the relevant
<BR>
sense. They *did* regard them as human in *many* senses: killing
<BR>
them would be considered murder, for example. But as *autonomous
<BR>
beings* gypsies weren't deemed fully human. Because of that, they
<BR>
weren't deemed entitled to control the decision about whether to
<BR>
sterilise them.
<BR>
<P>Are children entitled to make decisions that affect *them*?
<BR>
<P>Most people think not. But are they right about that?
<BR>
<P>Or are children the 'Swedish gypsies' of today?
<BR>
<P>The excuses people give for doing things to children against their
<BR>
will -- *all* such excuses -- are on a par with the excuses the
<BR>
Swedes gave for sterilising gypsies.
<BR>
<P>The arguments that show why it isn't right to do things to *gypsies*
<BR>
against their will apply just as much to every other group of
<BR>
people, including children. They all have opinions which can be
<BR>
overridden. And when you override their opinions, risking a mistake
<BR>
that *they* will suffer for, you are doing something *immoral*. The
<BR>
fact that you're doing it for the best as you see it, doesn't make
<BR>
it moral. And the fact that you're *sure* you're right *doesn't*
<BR>
mean you *are*. The Swedes weren't...
<BR>
<P>I believe myself to be fallible -- I am a human being who *makes
<BR>
mistakes.* So in my dealings with other human beings, *including
<BR>
children*, I seek full, free, *genuine agreement*. When I disagree
<BR>
with others, I try to *persuade* them. I strive to use reason, never
<BR>
force. Even psychological force. (Unless it's self defence: if I'm
<BR>
accosted by a mugger, then he'll wish he'd picked on someone else.
<BR>
But my friends and family aren't muggers.)
<BR>
<P>So, in my dealings with others, I seek unanimous consent. For only
<BR>
then can my actions possibly be moral. Only then am I treating the
<BR>
other person as an end in himself rather than a means to my own
<BR>
ends.
