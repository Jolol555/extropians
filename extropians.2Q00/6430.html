Alex,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Besides, this will also really confuse the liberals-- &quot;What? Those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Techno-Libertarians are *helping* people? How low can they sink?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, exactly!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which would you rather have: a bit ear-liar chance to go to
<BR>
and Terra-form mars, up-load to a million times more
<BR>
intelligent/conscious and growing platform, and so on and so forth
<BR>
alone, having many of your loved ones information theoretically dead
<BR>
and gone, or would we be much happier if they too, or at least as many
<BR>
as possible, were first saved before we went off and did some of this
<BR>
fun stuff all alone?  People and all loved ones are more important
<BR>
than anything else if you ask me.  Doing anything to loose as few as
<BR>
possible, to as you say: &quot;help&quot; should be priority #1 for everyone I
<BR>
think.  The transition from a society full of death, and all the work
<BR>
required to achieve a society with no more death is going to be a gut
<BR>
wrenching difficult process.  Many people are already lost and are not
<BR>
going to make it, at least in the near term (the most difficult part),
<BR>
and none of us will make it alone.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes, it may make an impact on their lives five or ten years from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now, but you can't eat that, and you can't use that to pay the rent.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think your completely wrong here.  Look at all the major
<BR>
world religions of today that control 90% of the people!  How much
<BR>
money do they give so they can build their &quot;large and spacious&quot;
<BR>
buildings of &quot;worship&quot;?  Can you eat a huge exotic expensive temple
<BR>
with expensive stained glass windows?  Do their supposed God's ever
<BR>
&quot;pay the rent&quot;?  No!  All there is is some promise for which there is
<BR>
some miserable hope and absolutely no credible evidence that it is
<BR>
true, that if you starve, and go without paying rent, yet pay all your
<BR>
&quot;tithing&quot;, get &quot;baptized&quot;, sacrifice your life and die, you'll go to
<BR>
some unimaginable neither world heaven, separated from those that
<BR>
remain here, and supposedly be happy sitting on a cloud playing a harp
<BR>
for eternity.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Jane blue-collar and Joe six-pack (and frankly, me too)
<BR>
need is some organization that tells us, or at least helps us know
<BR>
what it is we should be doing in order to be good and have a shot at
<BR>
achieving salvation and exaltation.  A completely volunteer
<BR>
organization that has a simple, easy to understand party line that can
<BR>
be indoctrinated into us when we are toddlers in Sunday School.  Not
<BR>
some allegedly absolute infallible never changing dogma that no member
<BR>
has any influence on, but something dynamic that is always improving,
<BR>
improving because of our efforts if we are so inclined to get involved
<BR>
in and contribute to the improvement of the &quot;party line&quot; and make it
<BR>
better for everyone.  A party line like: always chose life over death
<BR>
or happiness and joy over misery; never give up; enough correct,
<BR>
rational, scientific... (including spiritual if you must) works can
<BR>
accomplishing anything; you don't die to get to haven and help your
<BR>
loved ones, you live and serve...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Jane and Joe (we) sometimes initially don't have what it
<BR>
takes to be motivated to seek after and find which religion might
<BR>
truly have a much better chance at giving us exaltation than the one
<BR>
we're stuck because it is falsely promising us a similar thing, there
<BR>
must be an unconditional loving &quot;missionary effort&quot; to help us all.
<BR>
The primary goal is to bring &quot;salvation and exaltation&quot; to as many
<BR>
people as possible via any rational and reliable mechanism that might
<BR>
help accomplish these goals.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once someone joins, or perhaps is &quot;baptized&quot; or something
<BR>
symbolic like this, they receive the 'right' to gain cryonic
<BR>
preservation, whether they can afford it or not, whether they are a
<BR>
&quot;sinner&quot; or not.  An all inclusive organization that has a goal of
<BR>
being all things to everyone, at least as much as is possible.  Of
<BR>
course, everyone is expected to volunteer to give up a bit of their
<BR>
&quot;rent&quot;, free time, and such, to help be a missionary and so on and so
<BR>
forth, and contribute to the fund to help make cryonic preservation
<BR>
available to all that want it whether they can afford it or not.
<BR>
Instead of building large and spacious buildings and meaningless
<BR>
worshiping busy work and begging for some God to do everything for us,
<BR>
the goal is always to do all and anything we can to contribute to any
<BR>
such effort, and to save as many loved ones as is possible in the
<BR>
fastest most rational, reliable, and hopeful way.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons the &quot;religions&quot; of the world are so
<BR>
successful is because they catch Joe and Jane (us) when we are young
<BR>
and they hit us with a large, nurturing, well organized, very
<BR>
supportive, active group, at least once a week, and hopefully every
<BR>
day, (at least until they receive some intelligence/consciousness
<BR>
amplification which get's them beyond such needs) over and over with
<BR>
the same old party line of what is really required to gain salvation
<BR>
and exaltation, and to create a true heaven absent of evils like
<BR>
separation, suffering, death....
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us don't yet have the money, intelligence and so on
<BR>
that is required to truly be Extropian.  Yet we can't do it all
<BR>
without everyone and even true Extropians can't successfully do
<BR>
anything alone.  So we all need everyone and some well organized and
<BR>
active &quot;religion&quot; to help us all know what it is we are striving for
<BR>
and that constantly helps us to have the faith and hope that long
<BR>
before there is anything &quot;all powerful&quot;, evils like separation,
<BR>
suffering, death...  might be completely overcome for all that want it
<BR>
and are willing to never give up until we get it.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think?  To date, most Extropians seem bent on
<BR>
fighting against organized religion?  Is this our biggest problem?
<BR>
Might we be more successful if we instead learn from them and all
<BR>
they've succeeded at doing despite themselves?  Imagine what Joe and
<BR>
Jane could do given a real shot at real exaltation, something we,
<BR>
ourselves, can chose and eventually determine exactly what we want it
<BR>
to be.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we've saved everyone possible, then we can go off and do
<BR>
fun things like tera-form Mars, create Dyson spheres, super brains...
<BR>
and anything else we might want to do with our immortal lives
<BR>
including maybe and hopefully eventually achieving enough omnipotence
<BR>
to be able to resurrect and pay back our dead and gone ancestors that
<BR>
would have given anything to be a part of such a heaven, but instead
<BR>
settled with living to create and give us, their children, everything
<BR>
we now have.  All this for the selfish hope that we might no longer be
<BR>
alone without them and eternally in their debt for what they all
<BR>
successfully gave to all of us.
<BR>
