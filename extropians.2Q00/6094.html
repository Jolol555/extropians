<EM>&gt; &gt; The quality I'm talking about has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  do with sensing the unexpected in the ordinary [snip]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  I've always thought of this way of seeing as being &quot;childlike,&quot; because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  young children often seem to understand it better than older people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm sure there IS a connection to &quot;childlike&quot; mental attributes.  When 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;young, our brains need to be very plastic and able to form lots of new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interconnections between concepts and novel perceptions.  As we age and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;master the basics of the world and culture we grow up in, evolution has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably selected pretty heavily in favor of &quot;locking in&quot; the connections
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that work.  Subjectively this is experienced as a dulling of perception and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fewer and fewer &quot;aha&quot; experiences.  Much of what people describe as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;psychedelic experience seems to be a recapturing of a childlike openness to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the novelty of individual experiences and the vividness of the moment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

Phil comments: One of the most valuable experiences I had in college - 
<BR>
initially, at least - was mariuanna intoxication.  What I learned was that 
<BR>
in fact I had been screening out most of the reality around me, all the 
<BR>
while thinking myself purposeful and intellectually pure.  The patterns and 
<BR>
alternative interpretations on every level - sensory, perceptual, 
<BR>
conceptual, emotional - were almost overwhelming.
<BR>
<P>A very large portion of maturation consists of that screening out process, 
<BR>
naturally.  Unfortunately, the most drastic filtering is required when you 
<BR>
have the fewest tools.  As a child, you learn particular filtering 
<BR>
techniques to the point that they become invisible to you.  This is normal.  
<BR>
I well recall learning piano.  At some point  in learning a set piece, I was 
<BR>
no longer directly aware of the motions of my hands and fingers.  I sensed 
<BR>
the overall pattern, not the notes.
<BR>
<P>THC allowed me to go back and look at the techniques that I had developed 
<BR>
for better or worse on the note and finger level.  I've never found a better 
<BR>
method for doing this, altho I haven't indulged for many years now, as I am 
<BR>
alreay overwhelmed by the data I'm having to deal with anyway.  Who needs 
<BR>
drugs?  Reality is too much already...  ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;One important goal of a mature psychopharmacology should be to give us 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tools
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to modulate this childlike openness.  We ought to be able to &quot;open up&quot; when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we need to, so that we can adapt to novel situations and clear out the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cobwebs of old, set behaviors.  At the same time, we need to be able to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;onto hard-won lessons about basics.
</EM><BR>
