<EM>&gt;than younger middle- class white males often very centered on science. But 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those persons cannot give the movement the momentum it needs. What should

<EM>&gt;be done then?

<P>You ask a hard nosed question prefaced by a generalization that could be
<BR>
accurate, but I don't think so.  When I first became a transhumanist, I did
<BR>
not know one geek in the crowd - not a single one.  There were scientists,
<BR>
but not that many, and there were many females.  As far as I know, they are
<BR>
still transhumansits.  Most were space enthusiasts and involved in
<BR>
business.  This transhuman group was formed by FM-2030 and he is quite far
<BR>
from being a scientist, a geek or socially inept.
<BR>
<P>What we must realize is that a fraction of extropians are on this email
<BR>
list.  I can't agree with you that transhumanist groups are not engaging
<BR>
more than the male/scientist lot.  A brief survey of transhumanists who
<BR>
have signed my Manifesto shows that 50% are females, and I would assume
<BR>
(and I don't think its a broad assumption) that they are hip from the
<BR>
comments and responses I have received.
<BR>
<P>This doesn't dismiss your views, and I do think that we need to branch out
<BR>
into other areas that are, perhaps, aesthetically pleasing, and emotionally
<BR>
stimulating.
