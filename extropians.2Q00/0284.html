<EM>&gt; &gt; I bet we could rig a device that would flip your license plate around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and randomly generate a known-unused number.  That would fix

<EM>&gt; Like a color LCD in an appropriate looking frame perhaps?  That would be

<EM>&gt; cool.  Not only could you change your license plate, but you could change

<EM>&gt; your state on the fly as well.  And you registration tags would always be

<P>Cool idea James.  It occurred to me that we have fallen into the classic
<BR>
enginerd thinking mode of machine vs machine.  Ever since we started
<BR>
the universal surveillance debate I have been thinking of ways to defeat
<BR>
the cams, then ways for the cams to defeat those who would defeat
<BR>
them, etc.
<BR>
<P>In all these cases, the rich and techno-haves always win.  There have
<BR>
been several posts regarding how the advantages acrue to this crowd,
<BR>
and Ive found no way around it.  The poor and techno-havenots lose
<BR>
every round.  I cannot find a way around it.  Even if we manage to
<BR>
get laws to prevent governments from getting surveillance, the poor
<BR>
and technots *still* lose, since the tiny and low cost cams become
<BR>
universal anyway, and end up mostly in the hands of the well off
<BR>
and techies.
<BR>
<P>So let me go off in another direction.  Perhaps it is *OK* that
<BR>
new-tech is not society's great equalizer, but is in fact yet another great
<BR>
unequalizer.  The digital divide grows.  Is it OK?  Why not?
<BR>
<P>In your mind's eye think of the group of people who learned to
<BR>
use computers vs those who did not.  Which group is better
<BR>
adapted to modern life?  Easy question, now consider we are
<BR>
about to see the next round with the wearable computers.  It
<BR>
is 1980 all over again.  Then it was the new desktop computers.
<BR>
Now it is the palm pilots and their logical descendants the
<BR>
wearables.  Getting these gadgets and learning to use them
<BR>
will divide the haves from the have nots even more than now.
<BR>
Right?  You and I are cool with that because we are the techies.
<BR>
I hope one of our sociologist gurus will speculate on where it
<BR>
all leads.  spike
