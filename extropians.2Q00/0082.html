<EM>&gt; &gt;  Though I agree GNR will help make CAtS better, if we just took that old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Saturn V design, which, if I'm right, is now unpatented, we could be making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  disposable launch vehicles that could put huge cargoes in orbit NOW!  We'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  be using a proven technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, however we dont have that design any more.  It is folklore in the
<BR>
space industry which I have been trying to confirm or overturn for
<BR>
years.  According to the legend, after the end of the Saturn V production
<BR>
run, the drawing package was not only not preserved, it was intentionally
<BR>
destroyed, so we couldn't build one now even if we wanted to.  A reliable
<BR>
source has told me that at least part of the package still exists in the
<BR>
archives at Johnson, but he could not confirm that it was all there.
<BR>
<P>Another source claims that the drawing package was not fully up to date
<BR>
ever; that skilled craftsmen knew how to make certain parts and that
<BR>
these tricks were never entered into the drawings back in the go-go
<BR>
rush of the 1960s, altho this latter part strains the imagination.  That
<BR>
sure wouldnt fly today.
<BR>
<P>The conspiracy theorist hold that the Saturn V drawings were destroyed
<BR>
in order to prevent the Saturn V from being considered a competitor
<BR>
for the space shuttle.
<BR>
<P>I suspect a more likely explanation is that no one awarded a contract
<BR>
to preserve the drawings and so North American Rockwell, et. al. didnt.
<BR>
Anybody know?  spike
