I hate to testify on the name of a mid-afternoon television [talk] show that
<BR>
I can not recall the name of (perhaps it was the Leeza show?), but in any
<BR>
case: This particular (born and later self proclaimed) man, that Damien
<BR>
mentions, did appear as a guest, along with others in similar situations. It
<BR>
became evident that the general feeling expressed by the guest's (all who
<BR>
had experienced gender reassignment by parents/doctors at an early age or as
<BR>
babies) thought it best, for the acting adults not to decide. It appeared as
<BR>
though the other guests, (aside from botched circumcision's) were born with
<BR>
ambiguous yet functional genitalia.
<BR>
Apparently the parents (there were some on the panel) state that they are
<BR>
pressured by the medical facility or doctors to &quot;hurry up&quot; and make a
<BR>
decision now (at birth), before time goes by and inflicts confusion on the
<BR>
child. In the cases on the show, it was suggested to the parents that they
<BR>
reassign. The now grown children clarified that they were too young to make
<BR>
a choice, and everyone who was there, as an adult, had returned to the
<BR>
gender they were at birth, the reverse of what they had grown up as. They
<BR>
had felt mutilated, and forced into a role that felt un-natural. Of course
<BR>
talk shows are not by any means a factual study. There may be others out
<BR>
there who have adapted perfectly. But if I were in the same situation, I
<BR>
think I would like to have the opportunity to grow up, and decide for
<BR>
myself. I suppose I felt a spilling of empathy of how difficult it must have
<BR>
been for them to deal with.

<BR>
<EM>&gt; Just wondering if anyone else has had a chance to read John Colapinto's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fascinating, heartbreaking (and rhetorically loaded) book AS NATURE MADE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HIM, about the famous case of the twin boy who lost his penis during a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; botched circumcision, was then castrated, surgically sex-reassigned and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; raised as a girl. His sponsor, Doc Money, claimed for years this was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; triumph of adaptation. It became the classic instance cited endlesly in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feminist and poststrucural `social construction' texts and courses. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact, the poor kid was a psychological mess, and finally came out in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adolescence as a male (and now married, with adopted kids).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The argument urged in the book (so far; I'm only halfway thru) is what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems to me the obvious one: once the brain has been dimorphised into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; male developmental cascade in utero and infancy, nurture can't re-set all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the implicit behavioral templates, or many of the physiological ones, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the absence of testicles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This case, however, fails to address the matter of eunuchs and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially castrati, where I assume boy singers were lopped exactly
</EM><BR>
because
<BR>
<EM>&gt; their voices thereafter mostly retained their soprano beauty (unlike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Brenda/David, whose voice changed without added hormones). My working
</EM><BR>
guess
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is that the history of castrati we see might be the result of several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intervening filter effects: say, the sweetest singers are those boys
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already (somewhat) feminised in utero; the only castrati who make it into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the annals are the ones who voices don't inconveniently crack anyway, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rest being chucked out...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In particular, I'd like to hear Loree Thomas's take on this.
