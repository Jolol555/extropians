<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;whole life&quot;, insurance company managed investments, are unlikely to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;generate a &quot;market&quot; return on the investment (due to the conservative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;strategy of insurance companies and the overhead of the &quot;management&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;provided by the company).  Term life is cheap because of the very low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;probability that you will die young. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I know zilch abt all this, but what happens if &amp; when (a) the insurance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  companies realise that medical/genomic/nanomed improvements in healthy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  longevity are adding together into a lifespan revolution (on the face of it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  fees should fall, but...), 
</EM><BR>
<P>Competitive pressure will inevitably cause improvements in human longevity to 
<BR>
impact life insurance premium rates.  This OUGHT to be visible across the 
<BR>
data already available (through the 20th century, for instance), although the 
<BR>
analysis would be pretty complex, since you'd have to adjust for factors such 
<BR>
as the growth of the over-all insured population and the increase in 
<BR>
diversity of demographic factors as that population increased.  Life 
<BR>
insurance actuaries actually ENJOY doing this sort of thing, though (scary, 
<BR>
isn't it?), so it wouldn't surprise me if there's an article in some 
<BR>
actuarial journal that contains this kind of analysis.  (Life insurance 
<BR>
actuaries make your average computer geek seem like a TV talk-show host.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (b) potential customer get it, too (they'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  stopping buying insurance, no?). If the whole customer base for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  insurance industry collapses around the same time revival becomes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  technically feasible - since both are constrained/enabled by the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  factors - then the cryo warehouse customers will be shit out of luck right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  when they need it most. No?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think someone already pointed out the fallacy here: The proceeds of a 
<BR>
cryo-targeted life insurance policy are transferred to the suspension 
<BR>
facility at the time of death, so the long-term viability of insurers is an 
<BR>
issue only up to the time of a client's death.  In theory, all CURRENT 
<BR>
policies are fully supported on an insurers balance sheet under CURRENT 
<BR>
mortality assumptions, so increases in longevity actually serve to INCREASE 
<BR>
the solvency of assets backing &quot;in-force&quot; policies, as they are called in the 
<BR>
industry.  Understand that the financial viability of life insurers is a 
<BR>
function of the company's general investment strategy and, given the over-all 
<BR>
conservative nature of those strategies, life insurance investment portfolios 
<BR>
do no worse than the general economy (or only a little worse).
<BR>
<P>Truly radical and swift increases in human longevity might well cause a 
<BR>
decrease in demand for new policies and could conceivably cause a slight 
<BR>
increase in the &quot;lapse rate&quot; of in-force policies, but I would expect that 
<BR>
savings and investment vehicles would evolve to take this into account, such 
<BR>
that would-be suspendees in a post-longevity-breakthrough period would be 
<BR>
able to find suitable substitutes for life insurance.
