<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The design philosophy in America evolved in the late 19th or early 20th
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;century to the engineering maxim that &quot;we can build anything for a dollar a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pound.&quot;  It is worthwhile to compare the Amiga OS, which originated in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Britain as TRIPOS, a real-time industrial control mini-computer OS, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;LINUX, or Gasse's BeOS, with the American products - MS/DOS, Windows,
</EM><BR>
MacOS.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  With design and forethought, the Amiga OS could easilly run rings around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Windows or the Mac at the same clock speed, yet it was much easier to use,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more stable, and a tiny fraction of the size.  (Imagine being able to
</EM><BR>
format
<BR>
<EM>&gt;not one, but several floppies, simultaneously, while running five or six
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;applications and communicating online with no noticeable slowdown, and
</EM><BR>
being
<BR>
<EM>&gt;able to switch tasks in 1/60th of a second, reliably.  The Amiga was doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that in 1990.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Then look at the absolutely unbelievable bugs and stupidity of Windows,
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt;can't even recall from one instant to the next what kind of view you want -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;icons, list, details, big icons.  It's a random draw - except when Windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;willy-nilly decides to default to some view permanently - which happens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And the errors were carried forward from Win'95 to '98!  If someone had
</EM><BR>
told
<BR>
<EM>&gt;me that such an atrocity was going to be the dominant OS of the year 2000
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt;1980, I would have thought they were insane.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've mentioned this before but I had an Amiga once....two of them
<BR>
actually...the original and then the Amiga2000.  Some years passed and THEN
<BR>
i was introduced to MicroSloth....I was shocked!!  Shocked I say!!
<BR>
Disgustingly primitive and hard to use by comparison
<BR>
How come this happened?   How did the bad overcome the good?
<BR>
<P>Were not talking politics here (are we?) but engineering and software
<BR>
design.
