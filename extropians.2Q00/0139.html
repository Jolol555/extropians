Whatever one may feel about a woman's right to choose an abortion, the fact 
<BR>
is that Sanger's efforts were not aimed at maximizing free choice, but were 
<BR>
instead part of a plan to eliminate human beings, particularly those human 
<BR>
beings that Sanger believed were not fit to exist. Sanger was a leading 
<BR>
proponent of compulsory eugenics,

<P>This is very sad and disappointing to learn.  H.G. Wells also had views 
<BR>
which marred his character and legacy.  Personally, I greatly prefer an 
<BR>
organization like Birthright to Planned Parenthood but the work Sanger did 
<BR>
in her life to help women of her time avoid constant pregnancy and oversized 
<BR>
families was invaluable.
