<EM>&gt; &gt; Its been said that people get the government they deserve.  If that is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;true,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pointing out the flaws in government is really highlighting the flaws in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; governed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Government somehow brings out the worst in people.  There is no limit to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;many people are willing to exploit our weaknesses.  If we are prone to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;vanity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they flatter us.  If we value safety and security, they frighten us.  If we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compassionate, they will steal from us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
And if you think that's bad, now we also have the Russian Mafia moving into 
<BR>
the U.S. in droves.  They - Russian mob bosses -have been quoted as saying 
<BR>
things like, &quot;America is like Disneyland to us, you should have Mickey Mouse 
<BR>
as President (we don't???!).&quot;  or, &quot;Krushchev said he would bury you.  He 
<BR>
didn't, but we will.&quot;  These are people - I've met some of them - who are 
<BR>
pure predators, bred from a line of centuries of predators going back to at 
<BR>
least Peter the Great.  When the Soviet Union collapsed, they stole 
<BR>
everything in sight and then hired the Italian Mafia as consultants to train 
<BR>
them in Western scams and methods so they could expand.
<BR>
<P>These people are the logical and inevitable result of centuries of state 
<BR>
tyranny, when there is no trust of anyone by anyone, no morality, everything 
<BR>
is for sale, and the only way to prosper is to be a better weasel.  In 
<BR>
Russia, they have always had to pay off the officials to run their 
<BR>
&quot;business.&quot;  Here, our very lack of total, ubiquitous corruption means that 
<BR>
their profit margins are much higher.  This is &quot;under the media radar,&quot; but 
<BR>
Ian Masters had a dynamite interview today on KPFK at 11:00 with a man who 
<BR>
just published a book on the subject and was promptly contacted by the FBI 
<BR>
with the information that a $100,000 contract was out on him and his family. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be rebroadcast Monday - call the station for the time - 
<BR>
818-985-5735.
