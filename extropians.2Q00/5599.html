You describe an atheist as laughing at religion. That may be your stance, but it is certainly not mine, or many others who are not believers. Not all people who believe in god/gods/goddess/whatever are being &quot;duped&quot;. Many are searching for manageable tenets on which to base their actions.

<P>Many spiritual people have things they can teach me.

<P>I really liked your take on this matter.  I think this is why the Mormonism has the growth rate it does.  Many people are searching for manageable tenets on which to base their actions.  And especially the actions of their present and unborn children so they will prosper in life in regards to work and family.  Even if those children grow up to go another way, at least they will (hopefully) at a young age have been taught right from wrong and will have developed their conscience.  I have seen children and teens where this has not happened and it is a sad and scary thing.  
<BR>
<P>I realize many would say an atheistic system of logic and ethics would better serve them but many parents are not excited about raising children by that.
<BR>
<P>But Daniel, why to you is Christianity evil?  The wars fought in the name of it?, individuals who use it to unjustly control others?, guilt?  I am curious...
