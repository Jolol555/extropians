<EM>&gt;Subject: Re: what if microsoft disobeyed the breakup?

<EM>&gt;Date: Sun, 18 Jun 2000 00:54:05 GMT

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I notice that this debate has been framed in a way that concentrates on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whether or not windows is a good OS, and whether or not free-market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;economics is the best system for introducing the best products to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;greatest number of people, for the best price.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So at what point would my freedom to produce and sell a product be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;secondary consideration to the effect on society that it has?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
This is how OTHER PEOPLE have tried to frame the debate.  The fact is that 
<BR>
Windows is a really lousy product in comparison to other products out there, 
<BR>
but that should really be a separate issue...  except that some of the ways 
<BR>
that MS has managed to capture its market has been through criminal behavior 
<BR>
- e.g., it's attempted stealing of Stacker for DOS 6.0 - or, I suspect, its 
<BR>
relationship to the state itself.  MS is a corporation, a legal child of the 
<BR>
state, that sells bigtime to state entities.  In fact, here in Orange 
<BR>
County, the public schools were forbidden to buy any computer equipment that 
<BR>
wasn't either Apple or MS compatible, to give just one little example, that 
<BR>
I am sure is repeated a zillion times.
<BR>
<P>So to cast this - an attack on MS - as an attack on the free market is very 
<BR>
disingenous.
<BR>
<P>As for the free market - PEOPLE create products.  Even the NAZIs were able, 
<BR>
by investing heavilly in scientists, to come up with all sorts of cool 
<BR>
products - although they used them in often despicable ways.  The Soviets 
<BR>
produced quite a few advanced products, especially in areas that depended on 
<BR>
long term scientific research, such as advanced metallurgy.
<BR>
<P>We have never had a real free economy.  If it actually took a totally free 
<BR>
economy to produce anything, we'd be dead - or never born.
<BR>
<P>&quot;to the greatest number of people, for the best price.&quot;  ???
<BR>
<P>I really don't know how to frame this to really encapulate an answer.  
<BR>
Suppose we had a totally free economy in which everyone happened to be 
<BR>
complete mystical religious idiots, who thought that technology was from the 
<BR>
devil?  Would that free market produce much of anything worthwhile?  Suppose 
<BR>
evil NAZI's appeared and enslaved them.  Wouldn't you expect a general 
<BR>
improvement in technology to result?
<BR>
<P>I like anarcho-capitalism for a whole lot of reasons, one of which is that 
<BR>
it is the lack of real freedom, and the stupid costs of the state which may 
<BR>
end up killing me right on the verge of the singularity.  What a disaster!  
<BR>
Overall, most of the time, free markets are better at producing good 
<BR>
products at good prices.  But this is not really what most of the argument 
<BR>
has been about.  It's what various people have tried to push or define the 
<BR>
argument into being.
