Friends,

<P><EM>&gt;Far be it from me to pass on an opportunity to pick a nit.  So long as it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doesn't rise to the level of &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; it is not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unconstitutional to be sentenced to hard labor.  However, this is not really 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the same thing as slavery.  Obviously the convict cannot be bought or sold 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and unlike the former slaves in the US, a convict does have certain civil 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rights which cannot (legally) be violated.
</EM><BR>
<P>Zero, did you check out the amendment before writing this?  
<BR>
<P>Well, here it is:
<BR>
<P>Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a
<BR>
punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,
<BR>
shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their
<BR>
jurisdiction. 
<BR>
<P>Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate
<BR>
legislation. 
<BR>
<P>The above wording compels the conclusion that, by the standards of the
<BR>
amendment writers, the &quot;punishment&quot; they envision fits the definition of
<BR>
&quot;slavery/involuntary servitude&quot;.  The two clauses are specifically and
<BR>
indisputably linked.  The equivalence was clear to the writers.
<BR>
<P>My point in the original posting was to show that the common belief that
<BR>
slavery is abolished by the 13th amendment is not entirely true.
<BR>
<P>Now, as you pointed out, slavery has several different elements--ownership
<BR>
of humans as property, forced labor, different/reduced legal
<BR>
rights/rules--and some variability.  My focus, though unstated, was on the
<BR>
forced labor aspect.
<BR>
<P>I did not have the amendment on hand when I composed the post, but drew on
<BR>
my recollection.  When I subsequently tracked it down again (a web search
<BR>
for &quot;US constitution&quot;), I found it at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/data/Constitution/amendment13/03.html#1">http://caselaw.findlaw.com/data/Constitution/amendment13/03.html#1</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I found that it was not quite as I had remembered.  My recollection was
<BR>
mistaken in that I thought all prisoners qualified as a potential slaves.
<BR>
It appears rather that this is the case only for those whose punishment
<BR>
specifies forced labor.
<BR>
<P>However, while rediscovering the details of the 13th amendment, I came
<BR>
across additional material about the limitations of its applicability.
<BR>
That is to say, further cases in which slavery/indentured servitude is not
<BR>
illegal (control the definition--the legal definition--and you can do any
<BR>
damn thing).  So the intent of my original post, which was to issue a
<BR>
warning that &quot;Watch out!  Slavery isn't as dead as you think.&quot; gets a bit
<BR>
more ammunition. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I am particularly fascinated by the way that military conscription, an
<BR>
example obvious to me, of involuntary servitude, is dismissed by the court
<BR>
as &quot;beyond question&quot;.  In a test of logical consistency, where the rights
<BR>
of the individual vie with the authoritarian priviledge of the government,
<BR>
the court comes down on the side of authoritarianism.  Surprise, surprise!
<BR>
<P>Anyway, check it out.   
<BR>
<P>(excerpt follows)
<BR>
<P>Situations in Which the Amendment Is Inapplicable 
<BR>
<P>In a wide range of situations the Thirteenth Amendment has been
<BR>
unsuccessfully pressed into service.  Thus, under a rubric of ''services
<BR>
which have from time immemorial been treated as exceptional,'' the Court
<BR>
held that contracts of seamen, involving to a certain extent the surrender
<BR>
of personal liberty, may be enforced without regard to the Amendment.36
<BR>
Similarly, enforcement of those duties which individuals owe the
<BR>
government, such as service in the military and on juries, is not
<BR>
covered.37 A state law requiring every able-bodied man within its
<BR>
jurisdiction to labor for a reasonable time on public roads near his
<BR>
residence without direct compensation was sustained.38 A Thirteenth
<BR>
Amendment challenge to conscription for military service was summarily
<BR>
rejected.39 A state law making it a misdemeanor for a lessor, or his agent
<BR>
or janitor, intentionally to fail to furnish such water, heat, light,
<BR>
elevator, telephone, or other services as may be required by the terms of
<BR>
the lease and necessary to the proper and customary use of the building was
<BR>
held not to create an involuntary servitude.40   A federal statute making
<BR>
it unlawful to coerce, compel, or constrain a communications licensee to
<BR>
employ persons in excess of the number of the employees needed to conduct
<BR>
his business was held not to implicate the Amendment. 41
<BR>
Footnotes
<BR>
<P>[Footnote 36] Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275, 282 (1897).
<BR>
<P>[Footnote 37] Butler v. Perry, 240 U.S. 328, 333 (1916).
<BR>
<P>[Footnote 38] Id.
<BR>
<P>[Footnote 39] Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366 (1918). The Court's
<BR>
analysis, in full, of the Thirteenth Amendment issue raised by a compulsory
<BR>
military draft was the following: ''As we are unable to conceive upon what
<BR>
theory the exaction by government from the citizen of the performance of
<BR>
his supreme and noble duty of contributing to the defense of the rights and
<BR>
honor of the nation, as the result of a war declared by the great
<BR>
representative body of the people, can be said to be the imposition of
<BR>
involuntary servitude in violation of the prohibitions of the Thirteenth
<BR>
Amendment, we are constrained to the conclusion that the contention to that
<BR>
effect is refuted by its mere statement.''
<BR>
<P>*****I (almost) cannot express how awestruck I am at the evil beauty of
<BR>
this legalese.  How about this as an alternate theory:  Leave it to the
<BR>
conscience of each individual to assess the moral legitimacy of the
<BR>
intended military action, and then, on the basis of that assessment, leave
<BR>
it to each individual to decide whether or not to participate.*****
<BR>
<P>Id. at 390. While the Supreme Court has never squarely held that
<BR>
conscription need not be premised on a declaration of war, indications are
<BR>
that the power is not constrained by the need for a formal declaration of
<BR>
war by ''the great representative body of the people.'' During the Vietnam
<BR>
War (an undeclared war) the Court, upholding a conviction for burning a
<BR>
draft card, declared that the power to classify and conscript manpower for
<BR>
military service was ''beyond question.'' United States v. O'Brien, 391
<BR>
U.S. 367, 377 (1968). See also United States v. Holmes, 387 F.2d 781, 784
<BR>
(7th Cir. 1968) (''the power of Congress to raise armies and to take
<BR>
effective measures to preserve their efficiency, is not limited by either
<BR>
the Thirteenth Amendment or the absence of a military emergency''), cert.
<BR>
denied 391 U.S. 956.
