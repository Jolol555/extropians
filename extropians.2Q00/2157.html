<P><EM>&gt; It is a myth that it is always possible to be completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  honest, clear, and courteous.  Most of the time it is, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  when it's not, courtesy should be the first to go. 
</EM><BR>
<P>OK lee, I understand. You're trying out your own new system. I happened in 
<BR>
your path, nothing personal. Personally, I thinkthe is grace and beauty in 
<BR>
what you said  
<BR>
- the art of courtesy - I adore those who can ride that line you speak of!! 
<BR>
To be confrontative AND courteous is hard. And yes, it's a discipline; takes 
<BR>
intelligence and planning.
<BR>
<P>You are using slurs like stupid because that's how you really &quot;feel&quot; about an 
<BR>
idea... 
<BR>
On list - honesty isn't about always saying how we *feel*  - it's knowing how 
<BR>
we feel and not letting that get in our way. Feelings about an idea is good, 
<BR>
but irrelevant. Unimportant. In fact if I tell you how I *feel* about people 
<BR>
having *feelings* about an idea...
<BR>
: - )
<BR>
<P>I agree that courtesy is not always appropriate (though I find it more 
<BR>
effective).
<BR>
Rudeness loses it's power if overused.
<BR>
If one always uses courtesy until pushed beyond a barrier, it will have 
<BR>
impact. 
<BR>
If you are always rude, and calling people slurs -- no one will pay attention 
<BR>
when you do.
<BR>
<P>I do not treat people I respect poorly even when angry at them.
<BR>
If I simply disagree, I am not angry. 
<BR>
I can say:
<BR>
Have you researched this enough to make such a bold statement?
<BR>
Or: I do not believe that! It's simply not true.
<BR>
Or: Perhaps your sentiments have gotten in the way of your thinking.
<BR>
Or: Can you be more clear? That makes no sense. 
<BR>
Once I heard Max More say to someone at dinner &quot;You're not overly fond of 
<BR>
critical thinking, are you?&quot;
<BR>
; - ) 
<BR>
<P>Addendum: 
<BR>
If I really don't give a damn about someone because they have shown no 
<BR>
sympathy or compassion for me, it is OK to say &quot;I don't give a damn about 
<BR>
you.&quot; But I must be ready to let go of them and never see them again.
