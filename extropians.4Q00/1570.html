</em><br>
<p>It might be stable, but its not, apparently, the lowest energy compound of
<br>
nitrogen, since the Manhattan Project scientists were concerned at the time of
<br>
the Alamagordo test that it would touch off the worldwide combustion of the
<br>
earths atmosphere... It just takes a really high temperature to make it combust,
<br>
which is why nukes don't do so, the energy output dissipates too quickly in open
<br>
air to maintain the continued reaction, so at some distance from ground zero,
<br>
the air no longer combusts. I imagine that the jet we are talking about must
<br>
have one hell of a compression system to get N and O to sustainably combust.
