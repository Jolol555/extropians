<p>
I confess that I've only briefly skimmed this discussion But, from what 
<br>
I've read, I suspect some of the disagreement might result from not having 
<br>
distinguished two senses of identity:
<br>
<p>Numerical (or logical) identity and qualitative identity.
<br>
<p>I take it that John Clark is saying that two later individuals are both 
<br>
&quot;you&quot; so long as they are qualitatively identical. I take it that Jason, 
<br>
Harvey and others are stressing that copies or later divisions of the self 
<br>
are numerically distinct selves, and so cannot be logically identical to 
<br>
the earlier (single) self.
<br>
<p>If this is part of the disagreement, both sides may not disagree as much as 
<br>
it seems, since these two views are consistent. I certainly do not believe 
<br>
that John is suggesting some mysterious non-physical transfer of energy or 
<br>
information between individuals. My own view (largely inspired by Derek 
<br>
Parfit in Reasons and Persons) is that if you copy me exactly, both later 
<br>
Max's (MaxB2001 and MaxC2001 will be continuers or survivors of me 
<br>
(MaxA2000). We will not share identity in the logical sense, since 
<br>
transitivity breaks down. But I would regard both the later individuals as 
<br>
having equally good claims on being continuations of me (MaxA2000), and I 
<br>
would regard it as true that I (MaxA2001) would have survived as two new 
<br>
individuals. Logically I (MaxA2000) would not longer exist in 2001, but I 
<br>
don't think that it is logical identity that matters. What matters is that 
<br>
there be a continuous chain of psychological continuity and connectedness 
<br>
over time, and the two later selves would ensure this just as well as my 
<br>
continuing as a single self.
<br>
<p>This might resolve some of the disagreement, but the difficult question of 
<br>
whether MaxB2001's survival would ameliorate the death of MaxC2001 is more 
<br>
tricky. My view is that it's a matter of degree. (I seem to disagree with 
<br>
John here. Or am I misinterpreting what I ready by you, John?) There's no 
<br>
sharp cut-off line for me. The more recently I backed up my self, the more 
<br>
comfortable I am with the idea that the revived copy is me (or enough-me). 
<br>
I don't see a 95% qualitatively identical copy surviving my (MaxA2000) 
<br>
death as any different from my being cryonically suspended and revived with 
<br>
95% fidelity.
<br>
<p>Most of you already know this, but for those who don't and have the time to 
<br>
spare, my entire Ph.D. dissertation on this topic from 1994-95) is on my 
<br>
website. While chapters 3 and 4 have some fun stuff, the relevant material 
<br>
to this discussion is mostly in Chapter One: Causal Conditions for 
<br>
Continuity, and Chapter Two: The Terminus of the Self.

<br>
<p>Does anyone know how many times this topic has been discussed on the 
<br>
Extropians list since 1991?  :-)  Each time usually something new is said. 
<br>
Strange how we &quot;extrobots&quot; can have such continual and vigorous 
<br>
intellectual disagreements. :-)
<br>
<p>Onward!
