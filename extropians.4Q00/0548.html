<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not necessarily.  Suppose he was copulating with another gay mantis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After sex, the receptor mantis would devour the head of his companion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The notion of gay mantises lends an entirely new meaning to the term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;giving head&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Good one, Spike. But, you see, the female of the species, being much larger than
<br>
the male, is more capable of devouring her mate. Gay praying mantises would
<br>
probably be more equal in size.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After quietly listening to the exchange on this topic, I submit this notion:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is some yet unknown mechanical/genetic explanation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homosexuality that is a completely random event.  It comes from inheriting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the genital configuration from one parent and the sexual orientation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the other, and that the probability of this is about 5% regardless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of other factors.  I have had gay friends tell me they were gay since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as far back as their earliest memories, cases where twin boys were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raised identically as far as anyone could tell, yet only one is gay.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be something genetic, decided at the moment of conception.
</em><br>
<p>The mechanism involved is called &quot;imprinting&quot; and it works like this:
<br>
The sensory stimuli which accompany the first experience of sexual feelings are
<br>
&quot;imprinted&quot; -- that is, permanently associated with sexual feelings in the
<br>
brain.
<br>
Similar imprinting occurs in, for example, geese, which imprint on the first
<br>
moving object they see after hatching, and consider that as their mother hen,
<br>
and follow it wherever it goes. So, human experimenters can have a gosling brood
<br>
follow them around when they wear the footwear they had on to imprint the
<br>
goslings.
<br>
And humans will follow up on the set of stimuli which they first associate with
<br>
feelings of sexual attraction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is easy to see how societies with gays would have advantages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over those that do not, however the above notion would suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that *all* human societies have about the same percent gay, therefor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no group selection advantage there.  spike
</em><br>
<p>That's because it's not a function of genetics. It has to do with imprinting.
<br>

<p><p><p><p>basin of attraction If one thinks of the attractor as the low point of a
<br>
washbowl, then starting points on the counter top lie outside the basin of
<br>
attraction. Starting anywhere within the basin results in a trajectory that
<br>
circles around the attractor. Basins can be discontinuous, as seen in pinball
<br>
games. A bifurcation is a change from one basin of attraction to another, in the
<br>
manner of changing gaits. [68]  binding In linguistics, binding is the part of
<br>
the grammar which determines the reference of such words as he, himself, each
<br>
other. In cognitive neuroscience, binding is the notion that some process must
<br>
maintain links between the various features of a perceived object during
<br>
cognitive processing, given the dispersal of object features to those what
<br>
specialists in temporal lobe and to the where aspects specialists up in parietal
<br>
areas. One simple proposal is that the involved neurons in these dispersed areas
<br>
actually become synchronized, and that this is what recouples red with the top
<br>
light on the traffic signal (another object's features -- say, those
<br>
characterizing the approaching pedestrian -- synchronize at different times).
<br>
This proposed use of synchrony is, of course, on a much grander scale than I
<br>
propose for the triangular arrays, which might span a few millimeters. Binding
<br>
may not be needed except for very complex sensory scenes, such as the streaming
<br>
encountered when brachiating through the trees or driving a car; some suspect
<br>
that the perceived need for binding to reassemble specialists is a remnant of
<br>
the cartesian theater reasoning that Dennett critiques. [56]  bottleneck An
<br>
evolutionary event that greatly narrows the variability in a population.
