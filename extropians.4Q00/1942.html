</em><br>
<em>&gt; and your prices will shoot up by a factor of ten.  The Libertarian credo is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, even though it may be to the benefit of individuals to try and exert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control in specific cases, in the end everyone loses once the government gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved.  Looking over the interaction of people building and owning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buildings, what I see is a free economy that should be protected from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government interference, even if some people lose on individual transactions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's why I have a strong a priori prejudice towards choice A in situations
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Your reference to an ecomony that should be protected is interesting.. in
<br>
fact that is what I am arguing. The government or *something* must involve
<br>
itself in certain economic situations like this if that particular market
<br>
is going to &quot;flourish&quot;. Now you can argue hypothetically as an anarcho-
<br>
capitalist or whatever that you think government is bad, but you are still
<br>
going to have to come up with some kind of solution otherwise you will have
<br>
all houses on one side of the railroad tracks and all commercial development
<br>
on the other. And finally you have to consider the negative objective
<br>
consequences that your &quot;lack of participation&quot; will have. If you don't sign
<br>
the petition to try and fight for your chunk of the noise spectrum using
<br>
the only available current means then let's say the bar gets built, your
<br>
property value goes down, you lose sleep every night or get interrupted
<br>
during your deep thinking, and in the end the Singularity ends up being
<br>
delayed by a month. Was your idealistic choice of action worth it?
