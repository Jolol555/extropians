It seems that Nick Bostrom's replacing of the Anthropic Principles with his 
<br>
Observational Selection Effects and Probability,  His Doctoral Thesis, makes 
<br>
ETI even less likely. I, myself, suspect that ETI is likely there, but with 
<br>
our limited equipment, we stand a low likelihood that any signal will be 
<br>
identified as such.

<p>&lt;&lt;  think I'm responding to Nick Bostrom, following some discussion 
<br>
&nbsp;by Jason Thompson &amp; Hal Finney, but I'm not sure given the
<br>
&nbsp;forwarding this went through.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt;But finding a second source of intelligent life, in our relative vicinity, 
</em><br>
<em> &gt;would dramatically boost the support for those theories which say that 
</em><br>
<em> &gt;intelligent life is common. (My PhD thesis at 
</em><br>
<em> &gt;<a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/phd">http://www.anthropic-principle.com/phd</a> has more on this and many other 
</em><br>
<em> &gt;related topics.)
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I think you may need to refine the term &quot;intelligent life&quot; a bit.  A pretty
<br>
&nbsp;good case can be made that dolphins, whales, and even perhaps other
<br>
&nbsp;primates are as &quot;intelligent&quot; as we are.  What they lack is a system
<br>
&nbsp;for recording and transmitting knowledge across generations.  I think the
<br>
&nbsp;human ability to do this is what makes us interesting.  So, you want
<br>
&nbsp;to really focus on the development of intelligent &quot;technological&quot; life.
<br>
&nbsp;Of interest, might also be species, that are much less intelligent, but
<br>
&nbsp;do develop the ability to archive information, then retreive and  manipulate
<br>
&nbsp;it.  Hive minds of insects that developed external information storage 
<br>
&nbsp;technologies might be very interesting.  I believe there was
<br>
&nbsp;an example of this in Permutation City. &gt;&gt;
