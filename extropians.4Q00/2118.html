From: Dave Sill &lt;<a href="mailto:dsill@highland.net?Subject=Re:%20Election:%20I%20wonder...&In-Reply-To=&lt;200011091653.IAA20473@well.com&gt;">dsill@highland.net</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;I like the Electoral College. The U.S. is not just a homogeneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pool of citizens, it's an agglomeration of the 50 states (plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;D.C.), and the Electoral College guarantees that presidential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;candidates will have to court voters in many states. If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;election was decided by the popular vote, many states would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;left out since the candidates would, naturally, concentrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their campaigns on urban areas.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;If a candidate wins by the Electoral vote but loses the popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vote, it doesn't mean the Electoral College has failed, it means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's succeeded in balancing the power between urban and rural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;states.
</em><br>
<p>Your's is the classic argument.
<br>
<p>Did each candidate visit all 50 states (and territories)?
<br>
<p>Did each candidate spend an equal amount of time in each state and
<br>
rural/urban areas or did they concentrate on high electoral count
<br>
states?
<br>
<p>In a state where you had a good idea of how things are going to
<br>
come out, why even bother going to the polls?
<br>
<p>Without the electoral college the candidates might have to visit
<br>
everywhere, or risk losing the votes of those they didn't visit.
<br>
<p>It might eliminate the extremely obnoxious press coverage on
<br>
election night where they were calling the election hours before
<br>
before polls had closed.
<br>
<p>I personally would rather they NOT visit, they made a mess of
<br>
traffic here a number of times during their visits.
