Show me a rule, and I'll show you 10^3 ways to interprete it in
<br>
exactly the opposite way as intended. Show me two rules, and I'll show 
<br>
you 10^6 ways to turn it around.
<br>
<p>Reality doesn't like formal rules. They make for too brittle designs.

<br>
What, have you started citing yourself now? Without even waiting for historians?
<br>
<p><em> &gt; As for that odd scenario you posted earlier, curiosity - however necessary or

</em><br>
<p>Please translate that into normal language, because that is entirely
<br>
incomprehensible.
