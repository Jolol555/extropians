<em>&gt; &gt; No, actually the whole idea is that nanotech/AI/superintelligence scenario is

</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; course is to try and be the most intense human you can be, here and now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without moping too much over how much better you would be if you didn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be human.  Arguably, firearms - and to an even greater extent, martial arts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - are a part of that.  The question, as always, is time.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheerio. The one rhetorical card I see you palming in the above is &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole idea&quot; s/b &quot;my [Eliezer's] whole idea&quot;. :) You're still doing 'way

</em><br>
<p>I didn't get that.  And what's s/b?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It can also be read as &quot;I have a handle on a piece of what the Universe

</em><br>
<p>I have that right now, and while I may know which end of a safety is up and
<br>
what a roundhouse kick is, the truth is that I don't know how to shoot and I
<br>
haven't taken any martial-arts training since age nine or so.  That particular
<br>
got-a-grip feeling is the result of self-awareness, knowing how your mind will
<br>
react even if you run across something you can't handle.
