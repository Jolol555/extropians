<em>&gt;From today's Winnipeg Free Press.
</em><br>
It's interesting to see these issues gradually percolate into the public
<br>
consciousness. Of course Mr. Dyer doesn't mention the most probable cause
<br>
(IMHO) of the silence, which is that the aliens are using very precisely
<br>
aimed low powered signals, compressed sufficiently to be indistinguishable
<br>
from thermal noise, even if we did happen to be in the line of sight of one
<br>
of them, which we probably aren't. Oh well :)

<p>Editorial
<br>
<p>So many new planets, so few signs of life
<br>
<p><p>Sun, Oct 22, 2000
<br>
<p><p>GWYNNE DYER
<br>
<p>&quot;YOU can go outside at night, even in Austin, and point at it and say that
<br>
star there has a planet around it,&quot; said Dr William Cochran of the
<br>
University of Texas's Department of Astronomy. Epsilon Eridani, the star in
<br>
question, is not especially bright, but it is very close: that's why it's
<br>
visible to the naked eye. Nobody has found a star with planets that close to
<br>
us before -- but then, until 1995 nobody had found any stars with planets
<br>
orbiting them at all.
<br>
<p>Then astronomers developed techniques for detecting planets (though only
<br>
very big ones) around other stars, and the flood-gates opened. In the past
<br>
five years, 40 new planets have been discovered, all gas giants on the same
<br>
scale as Jupiter, our own system's biggest planet. In August, at the
<br>
International Astronomical Union's 24th general assembly in Manchester,
<br>
England, another 10 have been revealed, including the planet found around
<br>
Epsilon Eridani by Cochran's team.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a very exciting discovery,&quot; explained Dr. Geoff Marcy of the rival
<br>
planet-hunting team at the University of California Berkeley, &quot;(because)
<br>
it's only 10 light years away. In the next 100 or 200 years, it will be one
<br>
of the first stars humans visit.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>It begins to look like a universe where it is normal for a star to have a
<br>
family of planets. While existing techniques still cannot discern smaller,
<br>
rocky planets like our own around other stars, the Solar System's familiar
<br>
pattern of several gas giants in outer orbits and some smaller, more
<br>
habitable planets closer in to the warmth of the sun also seems more and
<br>
more likely.
<br>
<p>So if suitable planets are as common as dirt, and life is not rare but
<br>
commonplace on them -- then where is everybody?
<br>
<p>The puzzle has been growing ever since the SETI (Search for
<br>
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) project was set up in the 1970s. Every
<br>
plausible frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum has been monitored more
<br>
or less continuously for signs of intelligent life-forms on other planets.
<br>
The result? Silence. Either there's nobody intelligent out there, or for
<br>
some reason they're not talking.
<br>
<p>This raises three possibilities, each of which would have large implications
<br>
for our view of our own place in the universe.
<br>
<p>One is that an intelligent species capable of producing high technology is
<br>
not a normal evolutionary outcome, but a freakish event. In that case, there
<br>
is a whole universe of friendly habitats with no intelligent natives out
<br>
there waiting for us, and the human race's far future could well resemble
<br>
the kind of &quot;galactic empire&quot; so beloved of early science fiction.
<br>
<p>The second, darker possibility is that while intelligent life crops up
<br>
often, it doesn't last long: species that develop technology wipe themselves
<br>
out quite fast. That could explain the silence, for if the average survival
<br>
time of a high-tech civilization is only a few hundred years, then even if
<br>
there are tens of billions of suitable planets in our galaxy, there would on
<br>
average be only one civilization (or none) in existence at any given time.
<br>
<p>The third, darkest possibility is that there are indeed lots of intelligent
<br>
species in the galaxy, but the smarter ones are keeping their heads down. If
<br>
you have no idea what's out there -- or if you know what's out there, and it
<br>
scares you half to death -- then the last thing you want to do is attract
<br>
attention by broadcasting your position across the cosmos.
<br>
<p>A fanciful speculation, but then all three of these options seem quite
<br>
unlikely -- yet one of them must be true. Our ignorance about the universe
<br>
is still very great, and unless the human race wipes itself out, later
<br>
generations will probably lump us together with the Ottomans and the Tang
<br>
Chinese and the Roman empire as &quot;dawn civilizations.&quot; But it is an
<br>
interesting time to be alive.
