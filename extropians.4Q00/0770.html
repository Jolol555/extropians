Virtual pets are nothing new. But the land that gave us the Tomagotchi is about
<br>
to deliver the first physical virtual pet-- in other words, a robot.

Sony's AIBO resembles a dog, much like Star Wars' C3PO resembles a human. AIBO
<br>
(which stands for Artificial Intelligence roBOt) also means &quot;buddy&quot; in Japanese,
<br>
and that's what these amazingly lifelike robotic dogs will become. The robot
<br>
contains 18 motors (four for the head, three for each leg and two in the tail)
<br>
that let it walk, sit, sleep, beg, and perform a host of other dog-like actions.

AIBO is an entirely new type of robot developed by Sony. Just having AIBO around
<br>
can make your day great. You'll have so much fun interacting with AIBO that you
<br>
might forget it's a robot! AIBO has emotions and instincts, and can learn and
<br>
develop its own personality while spending time with you in your home. As it
<br>
matures, it grows to be unique from any other AIBO -- your own personal robot
<br>
companion.

Sony said today it will begin selling a new pet robot by the end of the year as
<br>
a mechanical pal for its popular &quot;Aibo&quot; robot dog.
<br>
<p>Sony Aibo
<br>
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-2936506.html">http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-2936506.html</a>
<br>
&quot;It will be a friend of Aibo's, but we can't say anything more about it,&quot; a Sony
<br>
representative said. Further details, including the robot's launch date, will be
<br>
announced Oct 12.
<br>
Aibo, an 11-inch-tall doglike robot that can go for walks, chase after a ball
<br>
and wag its tail, went on sale in June 1999, priced at $2,290 (250,000 yen) in
<br>
Japan and $2,500 in the United States.
<br>
A limited edition of 3,000 Aibos sold out just 20 minutes after they went on
<br>
sale over the Internet in Japan, while 2,000 of the pricey pets were sold in
<br>
four days in the United States.
<br>
Responding to better-than-expected demand, the company made another 40,000,
<br>
slightly modified, Aibos for sale in Japan, the United States and Europe.
