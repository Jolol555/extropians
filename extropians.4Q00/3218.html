<em>&gt; Let's here 'em; the freaking-the-mundanes story
</em><br>
<p>I was talking to a friend via e-mail about a topic my friend knew I was
<br>
no expert on, and yet for every factual question that came up, I was
<br>
able to spin off the correct answer rather than, &quot;I don't know&quot;.  When
<br>
said friend later confessed amazement, I showed said friend how to use
<br>
a search engine as if it were no less natural than thinking.  Fill in
<br>
the details of friend's name and subject area to specify which of
<br>
multiple episodes.
<br>
<p>Someone asks me for a full list of the projects I'm working on and
<br>
thinking of working on, expecting my day job plus maybe one side
<br>
project.  Said person's jaw is left hanging once I have listed all
<br>
current projects, and get to confessing indecision about the business I
<br>
would next like to launch: cheap access to space, implantable
<br>
augemntation, or wearable computing.  Again, fill in the someone's name
<br>
to specify which of multiple episodes, sometimes more than once with the
<br>
same person (perhaps they thought I was joking, or that it was but a
<br>
temporary fancy).
<br>
<p>Who needs blue hair or visible piercings to freak people, at least those
<br>
who matter to oneself, these days?  ^_^;
