<p><em>&gt; If you think truth is a more important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal than utility, make an argument for it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought that is what I have done ... no point in labouring it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too much, it is fairly clear that truth is the better yardstick.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  Truth is an important concept, but is it really the only means
<br>
by which we should measure personal power?  Is truth always the best way to
<br>
achieve increased utility (or whatever goal you decide is worthy?)  And
<br>
further, in the context of this discussion (arbitrarily limiting belief
<br>
structures,) truth is a really fluid concept.  As far as personal
<br>
limitations go, the truth is often what you make it.  Believe in your
<br>
ability to succeed-- you'll make your own truth.  Conversely, self-doubt is
<br>
often self-fulfilling.  For myself, the goal is optimization, and truth is
<br>
often a very valuable means of achieving that-- this is why I often
<br>
reference the need for clear observation.  Learn your environment-- learn
<br>
how the system works, and play the game.
<br>
<p>Truth, in this context, means a realistic assessment of our ability rather
<br>
than
<br>
an outlook based optimism.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; I repeat, reject ideology because is false, not on grounds that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; limiting.
</em><br>
<p>I'll repeat my point here for clarity:  If Joe holds the belief that he is,
<br>
for instance, unable to talk to women, is that a false belief?
<br>
<p>Am not sure &quot;talking to women&quot; is empowerment. Is visiting a
<br>
prostitute *empowerment?* Isn't deliberating choosing NOT to talk
<br>
also an empowerment ....an exercise of choice? Why not empower
<br>
Joe by normalising his choice rather than by forcing him to act differently?
<br>
<p>Certainly
<br>
the aspect of JW Betty's ideology that we find limiting is its falsehood--
<br>
she's unlikely to really reap any eternal salvation from her refusal to take
<br>
a transfusion.  However, for many of us (list members) our limiting
<br>
ideologies have less to do with religious dogma, and more to do with the
<br>
particular kinds of fear that our environment imbues us with.  Many of us
<br>
hold beliefs that are 'truth-independent'... self-fulfilling bootstraps with
<br>
regards to our personal capabilities, our society, etc.  This is really what
<br>
I'm talking about.
<br>
<p>Children will automatically assume that the words of adults are true.
<br>
Adults will instantaneously take what people say at face value, but will
<br>
assess the truth-value very rapidly, measured against their life experience,
<br>
then either accept or reject. We may be acting on internal scripts learnt
<br>
from adults in childhood that were never properly analysed ....
<br>
<p>Hmm... sorry about that, I -do- get a little enthusiastic.  I have been on a
<br>
long journey of awakening to my own potential and it has made me very happy.
<br>
I guess its sort of hard to talk about these sorts of things without coming
<br>
across as Tony Robbins or something.  But there is a great truth here-- we
<br>
humans have power... and for those of us in the First world at least, there
<br>
are endless opportunities to manifest that power (and others, too.)  I am a
<br>
wee bit of an optimist, I admit it.  I do believe there is a way.  I'm not
<br>
talking about any spiritual, philosophical or psychological magic here
<br>
either-- just be awake.  Observe that there are people out there who operate
<br>
on another level-- who understand their empowerment-- who greedily embrace
<br>
life.
<br>
<p>Do you mean &quot;self-actualisation&quot; in the Rogerian sense?
<br>
If so, then you get my approval. I work as a brief strategic therapist
<br>
trying to achieve this type of (defined ) empowerment by hypnosis and
<br>
by other means ... shadow self work is particularly successful for me.
<br>
<p>This is the sort of conversation I'd like to have in person.
<br>
<p>$50 an hour I'm afraid ..... (I jest, meet me for a drink if in Leeds).
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'm not entirely sure why you hold that the word &quot;Human&quot; is a belief-- I'm
<br>
not sure that that's the context in which I most often hear it used.  I call
<br>
myself a human, but for me the word simply references my biological status.
<br>
Deciding to call yourself NOT-human seems arbitrary-- and if that's
<br>
effective for you, then I'm in favor of it.  But is that really a 'truer'
<br>
ideology, or simply a more effective one?  I think we agree here more than
<br>
you'd like to admit...
<br>
<p>The whole point (I though) of this list was that participants are actively
<br>
&quot;trans-human&quot; going on &quot;post-human&quot; .....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Again, this is my attempt to be ironic at your expense.
</em><br>
<p>Why?
<br>
<p>Just my normal conversation ... though I should remember that Americans
<br>
don't handle irony very well, it's more of a British thing maybe.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Can we imagine environments we don't want?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously ..... some people in antiquity invented hell.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, let me rephrase for clarity: &quot;can we imagine environments we don't
<br>
want to imagine?&quot;
<br>
<p>Nightmares are a good example of this.
<br>
<p>Level Up!
