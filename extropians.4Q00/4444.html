Feedmag, July 2000
<br>
<p><p>Erik Davis's first column on &quot;The Posthuman Condition&quot; contains a deep 
<br>
tension that makes for stimulating reading. On the one hand Davis clearly 
<br>
is fascinated by the &quot;technosciences&quot; that will alter human nature. He 
<br>
follows the tectonic shifts in technology and casts an eye over some of the 
<br>
cultures and philosophies closely associated with them. On the other hand, 
<br>
Davis finds these technologies and the ideas of transhumanists (who welcome 
<br>
these advances) unappealing. Despite the massive advances in neuroscience, 
<br>
genetics, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, etc., he thinks we are 
<br>
no closer to answering the question &quot;Who am I?&quot; today than in the past. 
<br>
Davis appears to be one of the &quot;New Mysterians&quot;a term used by some 
<br>
philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists to refer to mystical and 
<br>
obscurantist views of mind and self.
<br>
<p>Transhumanists views cohere well with mainstream functionalism. 
<br>
Functionalists see consciousness as an comprehensible process of certain 
<br>
complex physical systems. Functionalists do not see the subjective and 
<br>
objective views of consciousness as separated by &quot;a necessary and nearly 
<br>
irreducible gap&quot;. (Which is it? Is the gap necessary, or reducible with 
<br>
difficulty?) The very disciplines mentioned by Davisthe neurosciences, 
<br>
human-computer interfaces, artificial intelligence, genetics, and 
<br>
evolutionary thinkingcontinue to replace the darkness of self-ignorance 
<br>
with the light of self-knowledge. The New Mysterians see consciousness and 
<br>
self as forever beyond scientific comprehension, perhaps afraid to eat the 
<br>
fruit of the tree of knowledge because of the new choices it will bring.
<br>
<p>In the first installment of his column, Davis refers to extropians and 
<br>
their intellectual cousins as &quot;self-proclaimed posthumans&quot;. This is simply 
<br>
wrong. Extropians describe themselves as &quot;extropians&quot; or &quot;transhumanists&quot;, 
<br>
since clearly we have not yet transformed our human nature. A few may call 
<br>
themselves &quot;transhumans&quot; to make the point that we are already 
<br>
technologically intervening in human nature. The term &quot;posthuman&quot; refers to 
<br>
what comes after we thoroughly transform human nature, from radical 
<br>
biological changes to postbiological life. No one can sensibly claim to be 
<br>
posthuman today.
<br>
<p>Transhumanism is not a condition but a set of ideas that favor using 
<br>
science and technology guided by critical and creative thinking continually 
<br>
to transform the human condition for the better. &quot;Better&quot; means extending 
<br>
our years of vital life indefinitely, augmenting intelligence, refining 
<br>
emotions, developing ethically, and improving economic and social 
<br>
processes. You can think of transhumanism as being the supercharged heir to 
<br>
worn out, uninspiring humanism. Extropians form the largest single &quot;brand&quot; 
<br>
of transhumanism, distinguished in part by favoring voluntarist, 
<br>
decentralized, market approaches to social issues. Extropians are those who 
<br>
assent to the statement of values in The Extropian Principles. 
<br>
[<a href="http://www.extropy.org/extprn3.htm">http://www.extropy.org/extprn3.htm</a>]
<br>
<p>Rather than address extropian views with specifics, Davis resorts to ad 
<br>
hominem slurs. He talks of our &quot;almost adolescent hatred of limitations&quot;. 
<br>
Does Davis think we are mistaken to depart from conventional culture in 
<br>
vigorously opposing aging and death, in aiming to do away with depression, 
<br>
uncontrollable rage and other psychological disorders, and in seeking to 
<br>
abolish infirmity and irrationality and the shortcomings of the mindless 
<br>
results of evolution? Then he should explain why. Since extropians despise 
<br>
centralized control, destructive anti-rationalism, irrational racism, and 
<br>
blind hatred, would he also talk of our &quot;almost adolescent hatred of 
<br>
Nazism&quot;? Perhaps Davis actually intended his &quot;adolescent&quot; comment as a 
<br>
compliment. Smart adolescents are busy growing, learning, developing, and 
<br>
being enthusiastic about their present and future. From the perspective of 
<br>
the deeply mature persons we should become through centuries of vital 
<br>
living, the wisest of today will indeed seem adolescent in any sense of the 
<br>
term.
<br>
<p>Davis is spot on when he stresses the importance of deeply considering the 
<br>
&quot;cultural and psychological consequences of our changing human nature&quot;. His 
<br>
assertion that we ignore such consequences reveals that his research on 
<br>
extropian thinking was shallow. Any time spent on our email lists, checking 
<br>
talks we give (such as my Extro conference talks on altering human 
<br>
motivations and the mistaken cultural assumptions underpinning resistance 
<br>
to transhumanism), reading our public essays, or hearing what we have said 
<br>
on television would belay such an idea. It's true that, until recently, we 
<br>
have emphasized the positive possibilities more than the potential dangers 
<br>
with new technologies. We have seen no shortage of doomsayers to do that 
<br>
job. More recently we have been reaching out to address public concerns, as 
<br>
seen in responses to Bill Joy's essay by Ray Kurzweil, Natasha Vita-More, 
<br>
and myself. My book in progress revolves entirely around considering 
<br>
possible consequences and planning ahead for transhumanizing technologies.
<br>
<p>Davis sets up a simplistic contrast between the old myth of dehumanizing 
<br>
technology and the &quot;utopian transhuman paradise&quot;. This straw man 
<br>
characterization does a disservice to a vibrant, productive way of thinking 
<br>
about our future. Extropians do not expect a paradise. Paradise is an old 
<br>
myth for those weary of living. Nor do we extol &quot;technological 
<br>
perfectionism&quot; as Davis claims in his book. Paradise and perfectionism 
<br>
belong to religious myths. Extropians do not expect an end to all conflict, 
<br>
struggle, and strifethough we certainly desire  to reduce those through 
<br>
intelligence, technological progress, and good will. Rather than 
<br>
perfection, extropian thinking embodies a living ideal of continual 
<br>
progress. (Hence our ideals of perpetual progress, pancritical rationalism, 
<br>
self-transformation, and emergent order.) We aim for a constantly evolving 
<br>
and improving &quot;extropia&quot;, not a static utopia.
<br>
<p>In a sense I can agree with Davis when he writes that technoscience deepens 
<br>
rather than resolves the contradictions of the posthuman (actually 
<br>
transhuman) condition. Technoscience will open up entirely new options for 
<br>
self-sculpting. On the other hand, it will show dualistic and Mysterian 
<br>
ideas about the self to be pre-scientific and confining. New technologies 
<br>
will open new choices, freedoms, opportunities for self-expansion and 
<br>
improvement, emotional refinement, and heightened creativity. The real 
<br>
struggle will continue to be against rationalization, ignorance, fear, and 
<br>
control. Perhaps this last point can be an area of common ground for both 
<br>
Davis and transhumanists.
