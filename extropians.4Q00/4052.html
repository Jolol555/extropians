<p><em>&gt; The problem with having a total singularity in a field is that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fields are dependent on each other. The only fields that might have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real individual singularities are the finite fields where one day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything can be known (stamp collecting?).
</em><br>
<p>I don't think we expect a technological singularity in the field of stamp
<br>
collecting. ô¿ô
<br>
<p>In his book, _Consilience_, E. O. Wilson describes the overlapping of the
<br>
sciences, and how they all fit together (someday) to form a single body of
<br>
knowledge. If we figure out why there is anything rather than nothing
<br>
(theory of everything), before runaway technological acceleration spikes, we
<br>
will have robbed our mind children of this opportunity for discovery.
<br>
Consequently, I propose a toast... &lt;hiccup&gt; To the spiritual robo-sapiens
<br>
artilects of technological singularity: Go get 'em, kids.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Isn't that the same thing? I thought the vision was that nanotech would
</em><br>
come
<br>
<em>&gt;out of biotech, particularly the protein folding stuff, as general nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would bootstrap from protein based work?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Emlyn
</em><br>
<p>Sounds intriguing...
<br>
Where did you get the vision that (general) nanotech would bootstrap from
<br>
protein based work? It sounds like as good a vision as any. Did you read it
<br>
here, originate it yourself, discover it around Stanford, encounter it from
<br>
Drexler and company?
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,

<br>
<p>&quot;If you go back a hundred years,&quot; he explains, &quot;one of the biggest
<br>
scientific questions was 'what is life?' And one of the most prominent
<br>
theories had to do with vitalism--some substance, some thing that is
<br>
transmitted from cell to cell, animal to animal, that is the essence of
<br>
life. Well, you don't hear anybody talking about vitalism anymore. We've
<br>
come far enough to see all the mechanics--we've seen how DNA works, we've
<br>
seen all the pieces of the cell, and we don't have need for a hypothesis
<br>
like vitalism.&quot; So it will go, Sejnowski suspects, with consciousness.
<br>
(Phlogiston, incidentally, refers to a theoretical substance that people
<br>
once sought in combustible material, thinking it made up the &quot;substance&quot; of
<br>
fire.)
