Futurists drop doom and gloom for 2000s
<br>
By Louise Surette
<br>
Staff Reporter thestar.com
<br>
<p>As the year 2000 comes to an end, the one thing we know
<br>
for sure is that the world didn't come to an end as
<br>
some had predicted.
<br>
<p>Y2K chaos? Didn't happen. Tidal waves? Uh-uh. Droughts?
<br>
Disasters? Well, just the usual stuff.
<br>
<p>Still, that hasn't stopped futurists and forecasters
<br>
from coming up with a new round of forecasts, from
<br>
guesses about where the stock market is headed to
<br>
predictions about 'career pills' that postpone
<br>
menopause. And while last year's predictions were very
<br>
much doom and gloom, this year's are decidedly upbeat.
<br>
<p>They don't see technology as such a bad thing, either,
<br>
and whether it's business, lifestyles or medical
<br>
breakthroughs, the future looks rosy.
<br>
<p>&quot;People are so glad that nothing bad happened they're
<br>
extra confident now. They feel as if they can control
<br>
almost everything,&quot; says Marc Zwelling, a Toronto-based
<br>
futurist and president of Vector Research and
<br>
Development. Zwelling predicts, among other things,
<br>
that the Internet will yet prove to be a passing fad.
<br>
<p>One group that always has something to say this time of
<br>
year is The World Future Society, an international
<br>
group of futurists with chapters around the globe.
<br>
<p>The Maryland-based society's membership includes
<br>
leading futurists in the areas of finance, science and
<br>
technology. The membership is made up primarily of
<br>
academics, scientists and research analysts and
<br>
consultants.
<br>
<p>The January 2001 issue of the group's magazine, The
<br>
Futurist, predicts we'll be putting more money into
<br>
stocks, despite signs of an economic slowdown. It also
<br>
says the bull market of the 1990s will continue
<br>
uninterrupted, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average
<br>
hitting 40,000 points by 2016. It closed out 2000 at
<br>
10,786.85.
<br>
<p>On the broader economy, the group sees a rosy outlook
<br>
for the foreseeable future, but Dan Johnson, the
<br>
magazine's assistant editor, says while that's the
<br>
magazine's view, many Society members aren't so sure.
<br>
<p>Among the other forecasts:
<br>
<p>A larger proportion of the population will be single,
<br>
as more people postpone or forgo marriage. This will
<br>
lead to products and services aimed at this group.
<br>
<p>Within the decade, women will be able to take a &quot;career
<br>
pill&quot; that will reset their biological clocks and
<br>
postpone menopause.
<br>
<p>Leisure-oriented business will dominate the world
<br>
economy by 2015, thanks to productivity improvements
<br>
that give people more time to play.
<br>
<p>Gene therapy will by 2050 improve people's learning
<br>
abilities and reverse the effects of aging on memory.
<br>
<p>Within the next 20 years the echo-boom generation, or
<br>
children of the baby boomers, will wield more economic
<br>
power than their parents. They are already saving and
<br>
investing at a much earlier age than their parents.
<br>
<p>David Woolfson, co-ordinator for the Toronto chapter of
<br>
the World Future Society, says that while futurists are
<br>
optimistic in the short term, there are plenty of
<br>
challenges ahead.
<br>
<p>&quot;If you look at population growth and environmental
<br>
degradation, these are big trends. Many feel that 2020
<br>
is when these pressures will erupt.&quot;
<br>
<p>The key is to plan ahead - but that doesn't usually
<br>
happen, Woolfson says.
<br>
<p>&quot;Being a futurist involves a thought process of
<br>
addressing 10 or 20 years in the future and most people
<br>
don't think that way. They'd rather know what is going
<br>
to happen next week.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>PAST FUTURES
<br>
Some famous and not-so-famous predictions from years
<br>
gone by:
<br>
<p>In 1946, American film producer Darryl Zanuck said,
<br>
&quot;Television won't be able to hold on to any market it
<br>
captures after the first six months. People will soon
<br>
get tired of staring at a plywood box every night.&quot;
<br>
<p>Issac Asimov predicted in 1969 that nuclear power would
<br>
meet all of our energy needs by the year 2000.
<br>
<p>Charles Duell, U.S. commissioner of patents, said in
<br>
1899, &quot;The horse is here to stay, but the automobile is
<br>
only a novelty, a fad.&quot;
<br>
<p>Arthur C. Clarke, British futurist and author of the
<br>
novel 2001: A Space Odyssey, may have been anticipating
<br>
the Internet when he predicted the world would one day
<br>
have &quot;a great global library.&quot; But he was way off when
<br>
he said that by now all the planets would be colonized.
<br>
<p>Former American vice-president Hubert H. Humphrey
<br>
(1965-69) was right when he predicted that hereditary
<br>
defects would be corrected through the modification of
<br>
genetic chemistry by 2000, but wrong when he suggested
<br>
bacterial and viral diseases would be eliminated.
<br>
<p>Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, said in 1943, &quot;I think
<br>
there is a world market for maybe five computers.&quot;
<br>
<p>Inventor R. Buckminster Fuller said in 1966, &quot;By 2000,
<br>
politics will simply fade away. We will not see any
<br>
political parties.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>Aumentar!
<br>
Onward,
