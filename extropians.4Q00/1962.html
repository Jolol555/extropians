<p><em>&gt;Heh.  Yeah, some of his ideas are okay, but old hat- of *course*, if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have fractal robots (the basic idea dating back to Hans Moravec's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;christmas bush&quot; concept) you can do very fine grain mechanical labor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As I see it, JM has overall negative value, by adding no useful new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creative concepts with a huge ration of bogosity.
</em><br>
<p>Lately I havn't been able to stop thinking about microrobotics being an idea
<br>
for the ultimate &gt;H business. Great fun, practical and very educational.
<br>
<p>Something like Lego Mindstorm but with a more practical approach.
<br>
<p>Small components than can be easily assembled. A common mechanical end
<br>
electrical interface would be a must.
<br>
<p>Together with a freely available 3D modeller/simulator where you can use
<br>
alle the building blocks to simulate a robot, then press the &quot;order&quot; button
<br>
and have all the components delivered it could really change how people
<br>
would view robotics,  distributed intelligence and nanotechnology.
<br>
<p>Somebody could even start their own business by developing a robot in
<br>
software, buy a single version, test it, and if OK design a robot assembly
<br>
line to assemble that kind of robot to sell in preassembled versions. Like
<br>
fruit pickers, hoover bots, surveillance bots etc.
<br>
<p>If there is enough use for small robots it could have as big an impact as
<br>
the PC industry has had.
<br>
<p>Even the software to run it could be emulated on the desktop. I can just
<br>
imagine:
<br>
<p>&quot;Are you now playing with that computer again?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;But I am building an automated robotic floor-sweeper so we never have to
<br>
vacum again&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;ehh... Ok&quot;
<br>
<p>To bad it would be a very costly afair to start such a company. Developing
<br>
specifications and software.
