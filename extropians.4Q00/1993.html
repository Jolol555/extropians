<br>
attitudes of most of the people who live in this  country. People want their 
<br>
welfare and social security and they'd riot if  they didn't get it. There are 
<br>
also not enough people intelligent enough to  manage all the new industries 
<br>
that would come up as a result of government  de-regulation.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Zeb, you are right up to a point.  The point is that I believe that at some 
<br>
future time, that seems to be arriving, the producers will be able to deny 
<br>
the governments the economic power to dispense freebies in exchange for 
<br>
votes.

<p>I'm not sure I understand. As long as the government retains a monopoly over 
<br>
the application of force, nobody will be able to deny it anything. And isn't 
<br>
&quot;dispensing freebies in exchange for votes&quot; just a demeaning way of saying 
<br>
the government is acting in accordance to the wishes of its people? I've seen 
<br>
some arguments advanced by the &quot;encryption&quot; school by which the ability to 
<br>
maintain anonymity will prevent governments from taxing or otherwise imposing 
<br>
their will on people. Personally, I think encryption will lose to the ability 
<br>
to collect and decipher information. Whether this translates into more or 
<br>
less freedom will depend on the applications of the new technologies.
<br>
<p>As to people wanting some measure of protection from risk -- that's 
<br>
inevitable, IMHO. Civilization and progress are the result of humankind's 
<br>
efforts to escape the process of natural selection -- which is brutal and 
<br>
painful. Social Security, for example, is a collective extension of the 
<br>
family group/tribe/volk's desire to care for members of the group who no 
<br>
longer have the physical ability to fend for themselves. The only way to 
<br>
solve it, IMHO, is to cure old age -- a development that I believe will occur 
<br>
in our lifetimes (which may be longer than we expect &lt;G&gt;).
