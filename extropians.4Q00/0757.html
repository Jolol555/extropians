<p>Your hypothesis seems to be that the architecture of the human mind is poor
<br>
at communicating with other minds, and that some other architecture might do
<br>
much better.  You might be right, but I suspect that what you are seeing is
<br>
mainly the intrinsic difficulty of communication, which any architecture
<br>
will have to deal with.  AI researchers will be very happy to have an
<br>
architecture that even comes close to being as good as the human mind, and
<br>
there's no obvious reason to expect them to do much better any time soon.
<br>
<p>Also, a plausible theory is that primate brains evolved primarily to deal
<br>
with the social world around them.  So its not like one can argue that our
<br>
brains are bad at communication because they were evolved primarily for
<br>
other purposes.  Communication has been near the center of recent
<br>
evolutionary pressures on our brains.  This suggests even more that it
<br>
will be hard to do much better soon.
<br>
<p>Symbolic style AI, i.e, based on something like CYC, seems to me the best
<br>
hope at fulfilling your vision - as its primary forms of representation
<br>
are very close to human language.  Of course symbolic AI gets a lot of
<br>
criticism around here, though not from me.
