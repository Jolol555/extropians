<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; You still are making claims about the 3rd Reich which you have failed to

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  any documentation, while I have cited actual eyewitness statements that

<em>&gt; refute
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Speer is about as trust-worthy a source as Hermann Goering. They both were up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to their chins with blood and theft.
</em><br>
<p>You have no idea what you are talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would recommend Hitler's Willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Executioners by Goldhagen(1996). Another work of interest is Explaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hitler by Ron Rosenbaum (1999) and I would recommend Nazi Terror: The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gestapo, Jews, and ordinary German Citizens. Are you really going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hair-split when we know that the largest German Electric Company AEG, had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documentation discussing supplying power to the Dachau Death Camp?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, Speer's account has held up quite well to all cross examination.
<br>
Apparently you have not read it. Knowing of camp's existence and knowing what
<br>
went on inside them are two completely different things, which you apparently do
<br>
not seem to be able to distinguish. Speer did not find out about the goings on
<br>
until late in the war, and did not know how broad the 'final solution' was
<br>
carried out until after the war. He has acknowledged that when he found out about
<br>
the production line exections, etc. that his first reaction to his fellow war
<br>
prisoners was 'what a waste', because his attitude then was that he needed those
<br>
people to work.
<br>
<p>No historian has been able to find documentation at all outside of the SS that
<br>
disclosed any policy of systematic killing, except for that at the top which
<br>
involved Hitler.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AEG pre-existed before the 3rd Reich ever existed, and probably pre-dated the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Weimar Republic. The German insurance company, Allianz (alliance) was afraid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would have to pay indemnities to its Jewish clients after Chrystal Nacht,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; till Hermann Goering reassured Allianz, it would never have to do so. (The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rise and Fall of the 3rd Reich) By the way, Allianz just payed off some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indemnities to their former clients just in 1999, LOL!
</em><br>
<p>Its Kristallnacht, BTW. What does it matter that Allianz predates the Weimar
<br>
Rep.? That says nothing toward your claims that Nazis were capitalists, which you
<br>
have yet to show any documentation supporting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You know I haven't mentioned what the Belgian Minning companies did to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Central Africans in the llate 19th century. These guys were capitalists also.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, they did what they did under a national charter, with plenipotentiary
<br>
police powers, and the central africans were hardly any sort of saints of
<br>
democracy or civilization.
<br>
<em>&gt; Its a more complicated issue then you seem to acknowledge.  Perhaps you or
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Milt Friedman may make a decent case for harnessing capitalism to promote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical behavior as a decent side-effect? But the blood doesn't wash out as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shakesphere said much more elloquently; a lot of evil has been done in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past. Slavery was capitalistic, albeit a hideously evil, form of it. I stand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by my assetions, which might be clarified as &quot;making money is very nice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing evil (we need to define this!) to accomplish it crosses the line&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You come up with a few small minor cases, when the facts are that the Nazis and
<br>
the Soviets, both being socialists, committed hundreds and thousands of times
<br>
more crimes against humanity than any capitalist ever did.
