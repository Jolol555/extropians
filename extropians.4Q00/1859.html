<em>&gt; &gt;------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's an interesting question (#2) on the Massachusetts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ballot:  should incarcerated convicted felons be denied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right (that they currently have and occasionallyexercise) to vote in Massachusetts general elections?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The robot response is &quot;Of course!,&quot; of course, on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle that felons and children and lunatics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-honestiores in general should be denied all rights, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case one ever should chance to exercise such a right in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felonious, childish, lunatic, or subdig way.  But there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are felons and there are felons, and lunatics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lunatics.  Does scanning and printing currency invalidate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your political judgement as much or more than scooping it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of the supermarket cashdrawer?
</em><br>
<p>Felons who have been release from jail and served out their probation can, after
<br>
a certain amount of time, petition the court for 'relief of civil disability',
<br>
so your concern here is not neccessary, as there are mechanisms for certain
<br>
felons who wish to regain their right to vote and exercise other civil rights.
<br>
What the massachusetts bill is all about is giving democrats one more captive
<br>
block of disempowered people to get votes from (to join the elderly, disabled,
<br>
welfare dependents, etc). The reason they are pushing this is that the
<br>
Republican power in Massachusetts has been growing over the last decade, and
<br>
part of this is because so many criminals cannot now vote, and do not go through
<br>
the existing process to regain the ability to vote. What the democrats want to
<br>
be able to do is get their supporters appointed as wardens at prisons, who will
<br>
then deliver up an assured number of votes for democrat candidates that
<br>
republicans cannot touch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As an American gunowner I am subject to being declared a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felon by fiat;  as an Extropian sympathiser I feel often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I am developing and maintaining new memes and skills
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply so that I can use them to commit crimes yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unnamed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Incarceration, after all, is just a redefinition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limits.
</em><br>
<p>If that is your real concern, then don't worry. I expect if the democrats outlaw
<br>
them, you will quickly see Alaska and several western states secede from the
<br>
union. Don't know about New Hampshire, or Vermont, but I'm sure there would be
<br>
efforts made here. Don't think that the rest of the country is as dumb as the
<br>
people in Boston, New York, and DC.
<br>
<p>The sad thing is that the democrats know they HAVE to use the lobster method.
<br>
They will take things nice and slow, as they always have, two steps forward, one
<br>
back.
