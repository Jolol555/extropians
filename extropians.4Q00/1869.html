</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The natural world has not changed much.  But our intellectual and social
<br>
world has changed greatly.  Perhaps enough that what we were evolved for
<br>
is simply inadequate to the world we now inhabit.  And of course the
<br>
forces of technology and knowledge are accelerating us further from that
<br>
original environment.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But isn't it relevant that changing society's discount rates may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmful?  Or is that simply off topic for this paper?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if someone wrote a paper proposing to change prices.  Let's lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the price of gasoline to 10 cents a gallon.  That would improve social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare because there are more consumers than producers.  Is it reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to neglect the impact of that change on the supply of gasoline, and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look only at how this satisfies our preferences?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>No, and mandatory unilateral manipulations of this kind are almost
<br>
always a bad idea.  But a deeper appreciation of the changes of basic
<br>
assumptions and environment that are present and increasing might lead
<br>
to multilateral changes in the way we look at and run our economies and
<br>
in what we value.  This of course will not happen overnight.
