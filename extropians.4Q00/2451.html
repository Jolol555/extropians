<p><em>&gt; First, let me say that after 3 days, I'm really digging this list serve.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't been part of one for a long while and I'm throughly enjoying the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depth of thought and intelligence exhibited in the various threads.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders, thanks for a good quick overview about mysticism, sprituality and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magick.  Yes, I think most of Crowleyian magick is rather archaic and he did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get too caught up in supernatural experiences or states of consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I think that magick is a legtimate tool for focusing the will an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing change.  By practicing magick, you are able to focus your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consicousness in ritual so reinforce new thought connections.  NLP and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive therapy may be better tools than most magick.  But it seems that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most people practicing magick are riding the regress express back to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; archaic.  Could magick be re-invented.  I think yes.
</em><br>
<p>I have exactly the same view. Long-time readers of this list may
<br>
remember that I actually did study magick fairly seriously once upon a
<br>
dark age :-) but abandoned it for psychology and cognitive
<br>
neuroscience - they seem to work much better, have empirical support
<br>
and you avoid getting those colds after chanting at a crossroad all
<br>
night :-) There are some valid and interesting phenomena there to
<br>
investigate and use, but re-inventing magick is a huge task. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for mysticism, I agree with your statement:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Where it may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;helpful is on the emotional level, in getting a feel for how wonderful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the universe is or how we ourselves fit in with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is why mysticism has power to generate insight.  It centers you in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe so you can connect with you deep will.  I think that mystical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practices are necessary to strengthen that part.  Once you have the insight,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than yes, follow it and test it rationally.  But when I go to my rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought for insight, all I get is a bunch of weighing pros and cons and feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; de-centered.
</em><br>
<p>As Damasio pointed out, rational acting requires us to have an intect
<br>
link between our biological decision systems (&quot;thinking&quot;) and our
<br>
value systems (&quot;emotion&quot;). People who have damage to this interaction
<br>
think rationally but when they act in practice their bad evaluation of
<br>
what is good or bad make them do completely stupid things. This is
<br>
likely true to a lesser degree about most of us: we need to re-tune
<br>
our values and link them with our thinking in order to live
<br>
productive, rewarding lives. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After reading the extropian principles, I understand the need to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions and insight in their proper place.  However, it seems to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's too much minimization of those too qualities of human life.  Yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much of human experience and history has been plagued by unchecked emotion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But let's not reverse the swing in the opposite direction.  I would prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see an understanding put forth that expresses a relationship between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insight, emotion, and rational as though they were equals, each with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own realm of action.  Do any extropians view it this way?
</em><br>
<p>I think Max expressed it quite well in his talk at Extro 3, where he
<br>
spoke about the need for civilized emotions. The goal is not to become
<br>
an emotionless robot, but rather like Spock of Star Trek, who did have
<br>
emotions but mainly positive, useful ones like loyalty, curiosity and
<br>
humor.
