<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE NOVEMBER 3 2000

<br>
disease marker discovered; WHAT'S HOT: Lipoprotein-associated
<br>
phospholipase A2 strong predictor of heart disease; PROTOCOL: Fibrinogen

<br>
<p>Heart disease marker discovered
<br>
<p>It is widely believed that cardiovascular disease is caused by
<br>
controllable lifestyle factors:  high fat, high cholesterol diets, lack of
<br>
methylation enhancing nutrients, obesity, smoking and a sedentary
<br>
lifestyle.  High cholesterol and a family history of heart disease are
<br>
considered strong risk factors. However, in 48% of all men and 63% of all
<br>
women, their first heart attacks come as a surprise, occurring in
<br>
nonsmoking, nonobese men and women who do not have these risk factors.
<br>
Interleukin Genetics, Inc, has discovered variations in the IL-1 gene
<br>
which increase heart disease risk by two to four times in individuals
<br>
sixty years of age or younger.  The genetic variations cause increased
<br>
arterial inflammation, an important factor in the development of the
<br>
disease.
<br>
<p>Interleukin Genetics conducted a study in which 500 Mayo Clinic patients
<br>
were evaluated for traditional coronary artery disease risk factors such
<br>
as gender, smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, family history, age
<br>
and diabetes, as well as variants in the IL-1 gene.  Those with the
<br>
variant who were under sixty had a 3.9 higher risk of coronary artery
<br>
disease than those without it.  Another study, the National Institutes of
<br>
Health study of Atherosclerosis Risk in the Community, monitored 1900
<br>
individuals between the ages of 45 and 64 for nine years and found that
<br>
those possessing the genetic variant were 2 to 3.3 times as likely to have
<br>
thickening of the arterial walls, considered indicative of
<br>
atherosclerosis.
<br>
<p>Interleukin Genetics' Chief Executive Officer Philip R Reilly, MD, JD,
<br>
enthused, &quot;This discovery leads us to an early and very exciting practical
<br>
application of the Human Genome Project.  The investigation of IL-1
<br>
underscores how genetics research is redefining the way we look at heart
<br>
disease, and can stimulate the development of therapies that target
<br>
markers such as this one . . . The commercial availability of a test to
<br>
determine whether a patient possesses the IL-1 genetic risk factors could
<br>
be available within a year.&quot;
<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE Addendum
<br>
<p>Last week's Life Extension Update Exclusive reported on melatonin's
<br>
sexually stimulatory effect when administered in acute doses to rats.  A
<br>
few readers were concerned that the chronic dosing mentioned as inhibiting
<br>
sexual activity in rats would have the same effect on humans.  However,
<br>
the study's authors emphasized that the chronic dosing used in the
<br>
experiments was in large doses, and that a sexual stimulatory effect has
<br>
been reported in humans using small doses of melatonin once per night for
<br>
sleep.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
<p>Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 strong predictor of heart disease
<br>
<p>Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 is an enzyme that accompanies low
<br>
density lipoprotein (LDL), or &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol in the blood, and may be
<br>
involved in modifying LDL. Also known as platelet-activating factor
<br>
acetylhydrolase, the expression of this enzyme is regulated by mediators
<br>
of inflammation. While other inflammatory markers are known to be
<br>
predictive of coronary events, this ability is modified by other risk
<br>
factors.
<br>
<p>A study reported in the October 19 issue of the New England Journal of
<br>
Medicine utilized stored biological samples from The West of Scotland
<br>
Coronary Prevention Study, a trial that evaluated the drug Pravastatin's
<br>
preventive ability against coronary events in 6,595 men. Researchers
<br>
analyzed the study's baseline samples for lipoprotein-associated
<br>
phospholipase A2, as well as other markers of inflammation, such as
<br>
C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and white cell count in 580 subjects who
<br>
went on to develop a coronary event (defined in this study as a myocardial
<br>
infarction, bypass surgery or angioplasty) and matched each of these for
<br>
smoking status and age with controls who did not later experience a
<br>
coronary event.
<br>
<p>The study found that inflammatory markers were predictors of coronary
<br>
events but their predictive ability was weakened when other risk factors,
<br>
such as body mass index, HDL levels, triglycerides and systolic blood
<br>
pressure were taken into consideration. Lipoprotein-associated
<br>
phospholipase A2, however was strongly associated with the risk of a
<br>
coronary event, a risk that is statistically independent of other factors.
<br>
The group that had the highest levels of the enzyme also had double the
<br>
risk of a coronary event than those who had the lowest levels.
<br>
<p>The researchers proposed that lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 is
<br>
placed to release products of LDL oxidation into the artery wall. Because
<br>
inhibition of the enzyme has been demonstrated to have desirable effects
<br>
in vitro, they predict that the enzyme will become a new therapeutic
<br>
target.

<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Fibrinogen and cardiovascular disease
<br>
<p>Most heart attacks and strokes are caused by a blood clot that obstructs
<br>
the flow of blood to a portion of the heart or the brain. Blood clots that
<br>
form inside arteries are the leading causes of death in the Western world.
<br>
Blood clots kill almost 700,000 Americans every year.  High levels of the
<br>
blood-clotting agent fibrinogen predispose a person to coronary and
<br>
cerebral artery disease, even when other known risk factors such as
<br>
cholesterol are low. The role of fibrinogen in the development of
<br>
cardiovascular disease has been confirmed in several well controlled
<br>
studies.
<br>
<p>In 1996, Life Extension was the first research group to recognize the
<br>
importance of fibrinogen as an independent risk indicator for
<br>
cardiovascular disease. A new study in the Journal of the American College
<br>
of Cardiology (1999, 33:1347-52) validates the LEF position on fibrinogen
<br>
as an independent indicator and cause of heart attack, stroke, and
<br>
cardiovascular disease risk. This published report examined data on nearly
<br>
400 male physicians participating in the Physicians' Health Study. Blood
<br>
fibrinogen levels of 199 subjects who experienced heart attacks during the
<br>
study period were compared with those of 199 control subjects who did not
<br>
suffer heart attacks. The investigators report that patients with heart
<br>
attacks had significantly higher fibrinogen levels compared with healthy
<br>
controls. In fact, subjects with especially high fibrinogen levels had a
<br>
risk of heart attack twice that of men with lower levels of fibrinogen.
<br>
These findings remained unchanged regardless of the presence or absence of
<br>
other coronary risk factors, including high cholesterol.
<br>
<p>The following supplements offer synergistic benefits to assist in the
<br>
reduction of fibrinogen levels (over 300 mg/dL) and the risk of
<br>
cardiovascular disease:
<br>
<p>Aspirin, 81 mg every day, with the heaviest meal of the day.
<br>
Vitamin B6, 250 to 500 mg daily.
<br>
Vitamin C, 3000 to 5000 mg daily.
<br>
Vitamin E, 400 to 800 IU daily.
<br>
Folic acid, 800 mcg with every meal. Use a folic acid supplement that also
<br>
contains at least 1000 mcg of vitamin B12. Folic acid works
<br>
synergistically with vitamin B12 to lower homocysteine levels.
<br>
Ginkgo biloba, 120 mg daily.
<br>
Green tea, 350 mg a day of green tea, 95% polyphenol extract.
<br>
Herbal Cardiovascular Formula (contains bromelain), two capsules, 2 times
<br>
a day.
<br>
Mega EPA, 6 to 9 grams a day (six to eight Mega EPA capsules).
<br>
Niacin, 1500 to 3000 mg a day (if tolerable). Consider flush-free niacin
<br>
(inositol hexanicotinate) to avoid a &quot;red face.&quot;

<p>Super Ginkgo Extract
<br>
<p>European physicians are prescribing ginkgo biloba to slow down and reverse
<br>
aging of the brain. A number of well designed studies published in medical
<br>
journals have shown that ginkgo can improve mental function in people of
<br>
all ages. Some European physicians have stated that ginkgo is more
<br>
effective than high doses of Hydergine in treating senile dementia.
<br>
<p>Studies have consistently shown ginkgo to be beneficial in treating a
<br>
variety of conditions. Ginkgo has a positive effect on circulation, both
<br>
cerebral and peripheral, including an ability to reduce abnormalities of
<br>
muscle tone, of blood vessels, capillary permeability, abnormal
<br>
aggregation of blood platelets, arterial damage caused by atherosclerosis
<br>
and tissue damage caused by low blood flow.
