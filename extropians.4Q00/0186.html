Hierarchical Distributed Genetic Algorithms

<br>
Unlike conventional genetic algorithms, HDGAs use a multiresolutional search
<br>
scheme and change structure to achieve a goal. In this application, an HDGA
<br>
investigates various configurations dynamically to find the optimal design of a
<br>
fuzzy logic controller for a complex, unmanned, space-based plant.
<br>
With the emergence of high-performance computing power, design engineers have
<br>
applied AI techniques to a wide spectrum of real-world problems in intelligent
<br>
and autonomous control.1 At the University of Arizona, for example, we have
<br>
developed a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to control the temperature of a
<br>
space-based plant designed to produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere.

<p><p>Combinations of Evolutionary Computation and Neural Networks

<br>
Biologically motivated computing paradigms involving neural and evolutionary
<br>
ideas were prominent early in the history of computing, but were pushed into the
<br>
desert for forty years by handcrafted (creationist) approaches that could
<br>
deliverer immediate products. A confluence of factors emanating from computer
<br>
science, biology, and technology have brought self-organizing approaches back to
<br>
the fore. Neural networks in particular provide high evolvability platforms for
<br>
variation-selection search strategies. The
<br>
neuron doctrine and the fundamental nature of computing come into question. Is a
<br>
neuron an atom of the brain (artificial or natural) or is it itself a complex
<br>
information processing system whose interior molecular dynamics can be elicited
<br>
and exploited through the evolution process? We here argue the latter point of
<br>
view, illustrating how high evolvability dynamics can be achieved with
<br>
artificial neuromolecular computer designs and how such designs might in due
<br>
course be implemented using molecular computing devices. A table top
<br>
enzyme-driven prototype developed by our group is presented; it can be thought
<br>
of as a sort of artificial neuron in which the context sensitivity of enzyme
<br>
recognition is used to transform injected signal patterns into output activity.
