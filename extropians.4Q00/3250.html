<em>&gt;The fact is, neither party is anywhere close to the Liberatarian position

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>While I agree that many Republican platform planks are as anathema to 
<br>
Libertarianism as many Democratic ones, the point of Mr. Brin's 
<br>
original essay was about working within one (Mr. Brin mentioned only 
<br>
Democrats, but maybe he meant both parties) or both of the major 
<br>
parties to achieve Libertarian goals.
<br>
<p>The Libertarian party relies *supremely* upon substantial reduction 
<br>
of the power of the Federal Government.  Without reduction of the 
<br>
power of the Federal Government, only shadows of Libertarians' goals 
<br>
can be achieved.
<br>
<p>The Democrats get most of their power through the redistribution of 
<br>
wealth through the creation of social programs.  Reduction of the 
<br>
power of the Federal Government is something that they'll never abide.
<br>
<p>Sure, the Democrats are for legally protected same-sex unions and 
<br>
might some day allow the legalization of marijuana, but that's it. 
<br>
If you give the Democrats more power so they can give us those 
<br>
trifles, there is no subsequent step that Libertarians can take to 
<br>
achieve a reduction in taxes, the dismantling of costly entitlements 
<br>
like Social Security, the withdrawal of our military from 
<br>
world-building exercises, and the overall increase in power (and 
<br>
responsibility) of the individual to control her own destiny.  The 
<br>
Democratic party will only move the USA to being a semi-socialist 
<br>
country as can be found throughout the rest of the world, and the 
<br>
Libertarian party will lose all traction.  If that's all we want, 
<br>
then why not just move to Denmark?
<br>
<p>I dislike the religious component of the Republican party as much as 
<br>
anyone.  I'm an atheist living in Houston, and the vast number of 
<br>
churches here gives me the heebie geebies.  It *scares* me when 
<br>
Republicans like George Bush Sr. say that they don't think that 
<br>
atheists should have a voice in American politics.
<br>
<p>But the Republicans are the only ones even *willing to entertain* a 
<br>
reduction of taxes and a corresponding decrease in the size of the 
<br>
Federal Government.  As the Government's size decreases, they'll have 
<br>
no choice but to cut out more and more Government programs.  They'll 
<br>
have no choice but to reduce their expensive war on drugs.  I may not 
<br>
really like the goals of religious conservatives, but I can see how 
<br>
working with them, for now, can put us in a position to become a more 
<br>
Libertarian country.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
