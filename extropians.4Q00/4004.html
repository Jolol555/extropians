From: Damien Raphael Sullivan
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So we should dump everything at will into our little cage and see what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happens?
</em><br>
<p>That's not exactly what I am arguing for is it? It is not what is happening
<br>
now either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Proving that something is safe may be impossible.  But at least looking at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;persistent stuff to see what it might do seems only intelligent.  Look
</em><br>
before
<br>
<em>&gt;you leap, yes?
</em><br>
<p>Yes and we do that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; - No electricity. (Do you know how many people are getting killed by
</em><br>
that,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; - No cars. They cause emission, and roadkill.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; - No fertilizers, they cause loss of oxygen in the oceans.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Straw men; none of these is persistent and bioaccumulative.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe not as much as some other toxins. But they are none the less.
<br>
<p>Electricity isn't created out of thin air you know, soot particles from gas
<br>
and coal, radioactive waste, magnetic fields around High Voltage wires
<br>
causing cancer, or maybe not. Shouldn't we have stopped using electricity
<br>
when that suspision arrived?
<br>
<p>Cars are build of toxic materials that are poorly reused and have spewed
<br>
lead for decades. There is also small soot particles especially from
<br>
kerosene that is suspected af causing respitorial problems.
<br>
<p>Fertilizers certainly are accumulative and is killing the low waters around
<br>
here.
<br>
<p>Our forefathers couldn't know how toxic the above items would beforehand. In
<br>
the meanwhile the chance they took has payed of imensely. Beside, there is
<br>
many more examples these where just a few.
<br>
<p>It's all a balanced gamble. Hopefully it will be balanced enough to prevent
<br>
disasters.
<br>
<p>Historically it has looked like this:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;slow development/low risk               fast development/high risk
<br>
&lt;------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;poor society                                       wealthy society
<br>
<p>My problem with the precautionary principle is that it is used for non
<br>
ecological political goals here in Denmark, where the left wing is strongly
<br>
against any technological development more complicated than wind mills.
<br>
<p>We have (very high) taxes on cars, gas, electricity, fertilizers, pesticides
<br>
and consumption in general. None of these &quot;enviromental&quot; taxes are used to
<br>
better the enviroment. But to further their own agena.
<br>
<p>The ideological high brows of the enviromental mob, are so easily abused for
<br>
something else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And we know more chemistry and ecology than we did then; we're in a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;position to evaluate before we try.
</em><br>
<p>Fair point. The safer the better. Only problem is that the greens are
<br>
attacking the test fields and destroying the crops. They don't want safe
<br>
development, they want no development.
<br>
<p>Darn ... I sound more and more like Michael Lorrey :-)
