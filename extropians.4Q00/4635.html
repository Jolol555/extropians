<em>&gt;  &gt; Do you condemn logic, scientific method, theories, proofs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  peer-review, extrapolation and imagination when you condemn
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  philosophy?  Or do you exclude these from that realm when you condemn
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  all philosophy?  If so, you may be condemning the parts of philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  that I disdain while retaining the parts that I value.  That is, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  may agree on our choices, and merely classify them with different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  labels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'd exclude the scientific method from philosophy because the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;method requires hardware: empirical experimentation, direct observation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical measurement (which includes math), and philosophy does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;require these ties to reality to do its stuff.
</em><br>
<p>It appears that you condemn philosophy that excludes the scientific 
<br>
method, fails to test its theories, and does not have ties to 
<br>
reality.  I find this kind of philosophy to be useless as well.  If a 
<br>
kind of philosophy uses the scientific method, tests and validates 
<br>
its results, and only philosophizes about real-world reality, then 
<br>
you do not call it philosophy.  Given this kind of definition, I 
<br>
agree with your views.
<br>
<p>I think your definition of philosophy is too narrow, however.  You 
<br>
seem to have concluded that *all* philosophy is *bad*, and therefore 
<br>
anything that is not bad must not be philosophy.  This may not be a 
<br>
bad definition.  Just keep in mind that other people may use the word 
<br>
differently.  When Max says the Extropian Principals is a philosophy, 
<br>
or Mike talks about his philosophies about personal right-to-carry 
<br>
laws, these are not the kind of bad philosophy you are describing. 
<br>
But they may still use the word &quot;philosophy&quot;.
<br>
<p>Despite all the discussion on this topic, I don't think many people 
<br>
really disagree with you.  When you say all philosophy is bad, people 
<br>
think you are talking about different things.  When you describe a 
<br>
useless philosophy that is illogical, anti-science, unproven, or 
<br>
unrelated to reality, I think everyone agrees that this would be 
<br>
useless.
<br>
<p>The same applies to your concept of asking the wrong question.  I 
<br>
don't think any question is bad, only some answers.  If I ask how 
<br>
phlogiston works, this is not a bad question, as long as the answer 
<br>
is &quot;it is a theoretical substance possessing negative weight 
<br>
according to a theory that has since been proven false.&quot;  Instead of 
<br>
quibbling over whether the question is good or bad, I think it is 
<br>
more useful to determine whether the answer is good or bad.
