<p>As a computer engineer, I'm going to have to put my foot down here. 
<br>
I think that you're assuming that since you don't understand how 
<br>
something could be done, that you think that it can't be done.
<br>
<p>In fact, you can stop a running process and store it as information. 
<br>
What do you think happens when you put most laptops to sleep?  All of 
<br>
the relevant processes running are swapped out to disk along with 
<br>
their states along with everything else in RAM, as well of the 
<br>
registers and caches of the CPU and any relevant I/O device.
<br>
<p>You could remove the hard drive from that first machine and duplicate 
<br>
it exactly.  Then, you could take both hard drives and put them back 
<br>
in identical laptops and &quot;wake&quot; them.  They would both be running all 
<br>
the same programs you were - all at the same point of execution 
<br>
points as when you put them to sleep.  Which was the original?  Who 
<br>
cares?
<br>
<p>Assuming that human beings are just biological computers, it should 
<br>
eventually be possible to use the same techniques once we work out 
<br>
all of the neurochemical details.
<br>
