<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I'm not a Libertarian (mainly because I don't think the conditions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;right for such a philosophy to be practical), but can respect those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This goes into something I've been thinking about recently. I voted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Libertarian in the one presidential election I was old enough to vote in,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and I intend to do so in this one. At the same time, I know that if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Libertarian were president tommorow things would fall apart quickly. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the conditions are not right for it to be practical. By &quot;conditions&quot; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean one thing, the attitudes of most of the people who live in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;country. People want their welfare and social security and they'd riot if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they didn't get it. There are also not enough people intelligent enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manage all the new industries that would come up as a result of government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;de-regulation. Who knows how to manage a private freeway or privatized FDA
</em><br>
<em>&gt;properly? I don't think anybody does, and I think that without them there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be a lot of car wrecks and food poisoning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The solution, and reason I'll still vote for them, is that any political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophy must go hand-in-hand with democracy. All of what I've said above
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be false if a Libertarian actually got elected president in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;election, because it would mean a sizeable percentage of the population had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;voted for him. If a sizeable percentage of the population are voting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Libertarian, it means they probably are smart enough to manage their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lives and to run successful businesses that would provide the services
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government no longer would be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Voting for them contributes to the small percentage of the vote they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recieve. It draws attention to them, which will attract more people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laissez-faire type thinking, and hopefully to the belief and practice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being responsible for themselves.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a good analysis, but I must disagree with your statement that &quot;any 
<br>
political philosophy must go hand-in-hand with democracy.&quot; I'm not exactly 
<br>
sure of your meaning, but that statement's certainly not correct. One way to 
<br>
a new form of government is a degree of dissatisfaction with government that 
<br>
forces it to be disbanded. Another was is a non-violent revolution. I 
<br>
believe the philosophy of Trotskyism explicitly will not involve itself with 
<br>
democracy. Anarchism has nothing to do with democracy, unless you believe 
<br>
Noam Chomsky.
