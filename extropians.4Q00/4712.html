</em><br>
<em>&gt; A man hates his job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One day he comes home and begins to drink...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He drinks till he passes out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He gets up in the middle of the night, and goes to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bathroom. Then he turns out the light, and goes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back to bed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When he wakes up in the morning, he looks out his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; window and see's hundreds of people laying there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The man kills himself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Q. What did the man do for a living?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe he was a scientist developing some sort of bio/nano plague (maybe for the military or something). He drank a bunch because he was depressed about the people he was working on it for planning to use it, although maybe like the atomic-bomb research people he was originally interested in doing the research, but by this point he was against how it would be used but was in too deep now. And he went into the bathroom in the middle of the night because he had a dream that he had become infected with the disease, and he was checking to see if the signs (of whatever form) were showing on him. Reassured it was just a dream, he returns to bed. But then the next morning it turns out the plague had been released in some way (either accidentally or otherwise), and some activists against the research (bio, nano, whatever) had discovered his role in developing the plague and had brought some of the bodies of the dead there and piled them where he saw when he looked out of his window (either hoping to infect him with t<br>
he disease, or just in a demonstration/protest sort of way).
<br>
<p>lol... just a thought :-)
<br>
<p>Aumentar!
<br>
Onward,
