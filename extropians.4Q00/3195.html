Ojai Winter Dialogue/Retreat
<br>
<p>February 16 - 19, 2001
<br>
<p>Oak Grove School, Ojai, California
<br>
<p>Questioning Everyday Life: Can We Become Aware of our Conditioning?
<br>
<p>Hosted by the Krishnamurti Foundation of America
<br>
<p><a href="http://kfa.org/upcoming_dialogue.htm">http://kfa.org/upcoming_dialogue.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Event begins on Friday, February 16, 2001, with a buffet dinner in the
<br>
high school library (Oak Grove School) and ends on Monday 19th. around 3
<br>
p.m.
<br>
<p>Our theme for the year 2001 is Living in a World of Change. We see change
<br>
all around us all the time: the prodigious advances in computer
<br>
technology, in genetic research, in our attempts to conquer space. There
<br>
is seemingly no end to what we can accomplish, outwardly. Yet all around
<br>
us, too, there is conflict, there is war: it has become a fact of daily
<br>
life. Wherever we look, wherever we are, we are surrounded by images &amp;
<br>
descriptions of strife. And, whether we are directly involved in them or
<br>
not, political events have become our concern: the Middle East is in our
<br>
living room.
<br>
<p>Rarely, however, do we make the connection between what is happening
<br>
outwardly and the inner domain of our own psyche. We don't seem to realize
<br>
that, in the total scheme of things, it is we who have brought about this
<br>
situation: it is our strong notions of separate identity, our labeling of
<br>
others as evil &amp; wrong-headed, our inability to see ourselves clearly.
<br>
This, surely, is the starting-point. For, about other people I can do very
<br>
little, but I can do something about myself, since the conflict all around
<br>
me has been generated by the same division that exists within me.
<br>
<p>Division is endemic to social living as we know it: there is a knower here
<br>
and a world out there. This division, useful in practical terms, becomes
<br>
deadly in the sphere of relationship, where the images we have built about
<br>
ourselves constantly clash with those of others. Perhaps because we have
<br>
lived with it so long, we treat the underlying process as &quot;normal&quot; and
<br>
content ourselves with dealing with symptoms. This can, at best, produce
<br>
temporary alleviation: the root of the problem lies much deeper.
<br>
<p>The purpose of dialogue is to facilitate the process whereby we can come
<br>
to know ourselves. In coming together for a weekend of retreat, we take
<br>
the opportunity to refresh ourselves and to engage with others in a
<br>
friendly, serious way. We are again happy to be be hosting this Dialogue/
<br>
Retreat on the campus of the Oak Grove School. The event begins on Friday,
<br>
February 16, 2001, with a buffet dinner in the high school library and
<br>
ends on Monday 19th. around 3 p.m. We do hope you will be able to attend.
<br>
<p>Registration commences on December 12, 2000.
