<p>I think you misunderstood me.  I agree with you.  That's why I said &quot;at
<br>
least&quot; in the above.  I wonder if anyone is using large scale FPGAs to
<br>
get on the fly parallel [re-]configuration as/when needed.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; to be feasible for the task.  The software is another matter that is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; just going to magically come together.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you know how most scientific codes work? An computational engine of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively modest complexity is plowing through a mountain of data,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over and over and over again. Overall, few % code, the rest of it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data.  Frequently, in an embarassingly parallel fashion: many such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mills, loosely (only locally) coupled. Here you can speed up things by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using dedicated hardware and/or many nodes (thousands, millions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billions) running in a parallel fashion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Since scientifc computing was where I started out a couple of decades
<br>
ago, yeah, I do know about this.  Worked a little on an old CDC
<br>
supercomputer.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The code is easy enough to grok, through finding a magic set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parameters can be tricky. The mountain of data is where most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magic is. You have to initialize the simulation at the start which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something very, very carefully structured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You don't enter that huge of pile of opaque data in a text editor. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can write the computational engine in a text editor, provided you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how it is supposed to look like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only realistic way how to get at that initial set of data is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either growing it with an evolutionary algorithm (here the exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature of the computational engine is less crucial) or scanning a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critter. In latter case you'll have to write a very very precise yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-performance neuronal emulation engine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Depending on the purpose you are attempting to acheive of course.  I was
<br>
working on simulating oil fields at the time and the initial data came
<br>
from a lot of probes lowered down wells, seismic explosion data and
<br>
such.  Far more data was put out by the simulation run.  So much so the
<br>
challenge was mastering that data to allow meaningful analysis.  
<br>
<p>I question though how much initial state you would have to give a really
<br>
good neuronal simulation.  If it has workable learning (especially
<br>
pattern matching / abstraction) capabilities then why wouldn't simply
<br>
exposing it to a LOT of training information / interaction with the
<br>
world work?  It is not clear to me that newborn biological beasties are
<br>
so massively precoded.  Sure they have quite a bit of instinctual stuff
<br>
and some amount of built-in learning algorithms.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure why many apparently smart people still want to do it the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cyc way. Codify everything explicitly, using an army of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers, until the thing can limp off on its own. I just don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it work, because
</em><br>
<p>I don't want to do it that way or at least not only that way.  There are
<br>
aspects of the Cyc approach that result in useful stuff.  But I don't
<br>
think it is the approach that will give truly intelligent (and esp.
<br>
self-aware) AI.
