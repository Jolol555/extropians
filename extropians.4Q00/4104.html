<em>&gt;Here's the actual quote, with some context from his interview with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wolf Blitzer on March 9, 1999.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    I've traveled to every part of this country during the last six
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    years. During my service in the United States Congress, I took the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    important to our country's economic growth and environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    protection, improvements in our educational system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To many people, it seems that Al Gore was taking credit for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Internet.  It's certainly the way that I understood what he was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;saying when I saw the original interview.
</em><br>
<p>I don't want to get drawn into politics, because both major parties 
<br>
are flawed.  However, I will comment on the creation of the Internet. 
<br>
As much as Gore-bashers will hate it:
<br>
<p>Congressman Al Gore was one of the leading proponents of the bill 
<br>
that legalized public access to the Internet.  Before this bill 
<br>
passed, the Internet was limited to military and university access 
<br>
under government programs.  Gore specifically called this &quot;the 
<br>
Information Superhighway&quot; to parallel a similar bill his father had 
<br>
passed which created the Interstate Superhighway system.  As much as 
<br>
his father created the Interstate Highway system, Al Gore created the 
<br>
public Internet system in America.
<br>
<p>It was an obvious idea that would have happened no matter what, but 
<br>
Al Gore did bring the Internet to the American public.
