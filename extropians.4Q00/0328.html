<p><em>&gt;I think you have to distinguish between Capitalism at the Macro
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level and at the level of the individual businessman.
</em><br>
<p>I'm trying to distinguish between capitalism, a form of economics,
<br>
and the actions of greedy or unscrupulous persons.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In a capitalist society with a capitalist government no one except
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the government is allowed to initiate the use of force and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against only the invader and the criminal after due process.
</em><br>
<p>This is confusing economics with politics again. How or why to use
<br>
force has nothing to do with capitalism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But nothing in that process says that the individual businessman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has to be a capitalist in personal philosophy.  That individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could possibly be member of a number of personal philosophies but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if they can not get away with using force, coercion or deceit the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only tools left to them is free trade.
</em><br>
<p>Capitalism isn't a philosophy, it's a type of economics. My point
<br>
is that many traits of individuals are erroneously accredited to
<br>
capitalism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Personally I have worked for individual businessmen that were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complete scoundrels personally but could not effectively get away
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with that behavior given our laws and courts.  He made a business
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of contracting for work and his best workers knowing him would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demand, and got, pay in advance before they would go to the job. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The man was still operating as a capitalist even though he really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;didn't want to - he couldn't get away with anything else.
</em><br>
<p>This person may be a capitalist by default, but he/she is also
<br>
dishonest, and a scoundrel.
<br>
<p>Many people seem to think capitalism implies a certain set of moral
<br>
or ethical values (or it should). It does not.
<br>
<p>Scoundrels can also be capitalists, so can dictators.
