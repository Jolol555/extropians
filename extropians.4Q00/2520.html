<p>
I thought that while we're on the subject I'd include my own
<br>
nutrition/exercise program to give anyone interested some ideas.
<br>
Comments, suggestion are welcome.
<br>
<p>Statistics: 6'6&quot;, 285 pounds, 43 years young.
<br>
<p>NUTRITION:
<br>
<p>One of the tricks I learned recently from Dr Bob Arnot's book on
<br>
weight reduction was drinking a 10 ounce glass of skim milk about
<br>
15 minutes before each meal. In tests this initial protein boost
<br>
cut portions by 20% I've dropped 10 pounds in three weeks following
<br>
guidelines from this book. I'm rarely hungry.
<br>
<p>Breakfast: Monday through Friday its that glass of milk followed by
<br>
a big bowl of oatmeal, 1 large tablespoon of brown sugar, followed
<br>
by 1/4 of a cantaloupe. Saturday and Sunday I get eggs and either
<br>
bacon or more usually ham, wheat toast and of course the skim milk.
<br>
<p>Mid Morning: If I'm hungry at all an apple usually kills it,
<br>
sometimes a banana.
<br>
<p>Lunch: Weekdays, Milk then I usually pack either a ham, tuna, or
<br>
PBJ (peanut butter/jelly) on extremely healthy bread, and a piece
<br>
of fruit. Once or twice a week, I have a very healthy grilled
<br>
chicken burrito (mostly black beans and rice) and hold the sour
<br>
cream (nonfat yogurt works even better!). Weekends, something
<br>
healthy, good time for beans/rice.
<br>
<p>Mid afternoon: a piece of fruit (apple again) or a Clif bar if
<br>
anything (usually on workout days).
<br>
<p>Supper: Milk, normally a salad and a bowl of soup, or a light
<br>
dinner, chicken (remove the tasty skin) or fish with sweet potatoes
<br>
or rice. On workout days since I workout after work I often have
<br>
cereal. My current favorite is 3/4 of a big bowl of cherrios mixed
<br>
with 1/4 of a bowl of honey-nut cherrios. All the taste and 1/4 the
<br>
sugar! Another great trick from Dr Bob's book, mix healthy cereal
<br>
with something you really like.
<br>
<p>Things to eat more of: vegetables, fish, beans, and rice.
<br>
<p>Things to avoid like the plague: fatty red meat, sugar, fast
<br>
carbos: bread, sugar, pastry, white potatoes.
<br>
<p>Exercise:
<br>
<p>3 times a week regular after work, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday,
<br>
other days I'll hit the pool if I get a chance.
<br>
<p>30-40 minutes of mid lower body stretching, I do the upper part
<br>
during the regular workday. I use a technique called active
<br>
isolated stretching I learned initially from an earlier Dr Bob
<br>
Arnot book called &quot;Turning back the clock.&quot; Then I bought the book
<br>
by the guys who invented it, the Warburtons.
<br>
<p>Then it's crunch time usually 3-5 sets of 12.
<br>
<p>Then it's 30 minutes on the treadmill. I usually set the speed and
<br>
let the treadmill determine the incline based on heartrate. While
<br>
I'm burning off some extra pounds, I've been using a fat-burn
<br>
program that keeps you at 65%-70% heartrate. I'll go more cardio
<br>
when I'm where I want to be weight wise. Most people guess me at
<br>
about 250, (and 35!) that'd be perfect.
<br>
<p>On either Tuesday or Thursday or both I do some additional lower
<br>
body work, usually extensions of some kind on a cybex/nautilus
<br>
machine. Squats if someone's around in case I do something stupid
<br>
(never squat alone).
<br>
<p>Saturdays my upper body day, I use a combination of weight
<br>
bench/barbells and machines.
<br>
<p>I like a standard york barbell for bench pressing, then
<br>
barbells/machines (cybex,nautilus, HAMMER) for the rest. normally
<br>
3 sets 10-12 reps. I like to do supersets (quick sets of opposing
<br>
muscle groups) for variety. About 45 minutes.
<br>
<p>Sometimes after a heavy workout I'll have a TwinLabs Mass-Fuel
<br>
shake instead of dinner, but not very often, I'm trying to stay
<br>
past the &quot;more muscle the better&quot; stage, sculpting is in. 
<br>
<p>Make friends at the gym, keep things upbeat. After trying a number
<br>
of clubs, I'm at the local YMCA, It does alot for local kids and
<br>
families, and I like supporting that.
<br>
<p>Supplements: I take a good vitamin/ antioxidant protocol. The Life
<br>
Extension Foundations standard recommended protocol is excellent.
<br>
I take additional E (1000 I.U) and selenium at lunch, and saw
<br>
palmetto, ginger, and licorice twice a day. The last two are for my
<br>
stomach, three months after I decide to quit my least extropian
<br>
habit (alcohol) I developed GERD, I take prilosec every morning.
<br>
<p>Books: Dr Bob Arnots books on nutrition and &quot;Turning back the
<br>
clock&quot; are excellent, I second Max's recommendation on Arnold's
<br>
book, it's the bible. Add a subscription to &quot;Men's Health&quot; is a
<br>
good idea too.
<br>
<p>Zazen, learning guitar, watching bad/good T.V for relaxing.
<br>
<p>Get a physical before you start any serious program, your doctor is
<br>
your friend, get vaccinated. 
<br>
<p>Plenty of water and rest.
<br>
<p>Just some ideas..... Outward!
