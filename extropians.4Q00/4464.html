<p>Well, of course-- this *is* Star Trek we're talking about here! :-) The whole Borg concept, [as portrayed in Star Trek] already a contrived metaphor for technophobia, wasn't even used according to the show's own definitions... the most obvious example being the introduction of the &quot;Borg Queen&quot;, which disregards any previous &quot;group mind&quot; descriptions of the Borg, as *she* is now supposed to be the one controlling them all. ~sigh~ They could at least stay consistent with the original fallacies instead of introducing ones which contradict themselves! :-)

<p>Exactly, they wouldn't have a chance! I read a great book recently, _The Computers Of Star Trek_ by Lois H. Gresh and Robert Weinberg. It discussed what the &quot;Star Trek&quot; future would actually be like if the technologies incorporated (such as what must be a very high level of nanotech) were accurately projected, but also said that the reason why Star Trek's tech is so off-kilter is because, after all, it is a TV show, and a more realistic/accurate portrayal of the directions of future technologies would make for a far less commercially viable TV show. And the Borg wouldn't be the enemy ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't need a group mind to create a learning 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>lol... The scriptwriters could have Greg fill in the spots for &quot;legalbabble&quot; (like the infamous &quot;technobabble&quot;). :-)
<br>
<p>Aumentar!
<br>
Onward,
