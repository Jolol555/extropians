I was just wondering whether any of the computer-knowledgeable of you
<br>
extropians would be able to help me find something.  Looking at the piles of
<br>
papers, pdf's, images, news articles, etc. I've accumulated on my hard
<br>
drive, I started to think about how best to organize them.  What I am
<br>
looking for is a computer program that can search all of my text, html, or
<br>
pdf files, by key word or some other message, much like an internet search
<br>
engine, so that I could immediately bring up assorted sources of information
<br>
on any topic I needed.  If anyone knows of such a program, commercial or
<br>
free/shareware, please let me know.  I have little to no programming skills
<br>
(the last time I coded anything it was on an apple IIe), but I am willing to
<br>
learn if I could accomplish this.
<br>
<p>This sort of program seems to me to be a way to use existing technology to
<br>
enhance human memory.  I am always thinking, &quot;Now where did I read that?&quot; or
<br>
&quot;I know I have something about Topic X, but where is it?&quot;  Instead of
<br>
relying on wetware to remember these things, I could type in the search, and
<br>
have a much more reliable source.
<br>
<p>Now if only I had a wearable computer with enough memory to do this...
