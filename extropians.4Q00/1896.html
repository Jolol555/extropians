<em>&gt; It is, IMO, ridiculous to explain the existence of an interest rate by

</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The standard argument claims that, since I prefer pleasure more today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than tomorrow, and since I'm rational, I'd refuse to trade away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today's pleasure for tomorrow's pleasure, unless tomorrow's pleasure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was sufficiently greater than today's pleasure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This argument is wrong, because, if rational, it seems I'd also rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have pleasure yesterday than today, which is false.  I WOULD rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have $1M 20 years ago than $1M today, yet it's not at all obvious that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to eat an ice cream cone yesterday more than I'd like to eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that cone today.
</em><br>
<p>This was the same basic argument the authors were making, except that
<br>
they did not feel that this made you irrational.  It does mean that you
<br>
regret your past decisions, but that is not necessarily irrational.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (So far, we notice, there's no reason for a beneficient utilitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government to step in and make me eat my cone tomorrow instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eating it today, assuming that the government is trying to maximize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sum of my pleasure states over time.  If I eat the cone at time X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than at time Y, at time Y I'll wish I had a cone, and at time X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll be happy to have one.  It doesn't matter whether time X comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before or after time Y; I'd be just as happy, overall, either way.)
</em><br>
<p>Maybe you could have half the cone today and half tomorrow?  &quot;Half your
<br>
cake and eat it too,&quot; so to speak (sorry).
