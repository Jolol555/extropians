<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;At the same time, people's lives are not so different from hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;years ago, except many more people have automobiles, high technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; &gt;appliances and devices, and medicine, as well as entertainment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I would agree that people's lives are not so different IN A FUNDAMENTAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  SENSE from hundreds of years ago. Fundamental problems remain the same and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; fundamental patterns of solution also.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure this is true.
<br>
<p>1.  TV:  People sit for hours watching mindless entertainment on TV. 
<br>
That is different.
<br>
2.  Information-based Careers:  People develop careers that are more 
<br>
information-based and less labor-based.  That is a major difference.
<br>
3.  Education:  Almost everybody has basic education today.  That is 
<br>
different than in previous centuries.
<br>
4.  Travel:  Almost everybody works more than 20 miles from their 
<br>
home.  This would have been impossible in the days when travel was 
<br>
not so fast.  Also, most people have been outside their town, their 
<br>
county, and their state.  Many have been outside their country.  This 
<br>
is a major difference from previous centuries where most of the 
<br>
population was born, lived, and died in their own home town.
<br>
5.  Free Time:  We also work less time and have a lot of free time. 
<br>
That is a major difference.
<br>
6.  Communications:  Not much can happen in the world without us 
<br>
knowing about it instantly.  No major wars can break out, no 
<br>
assassinations can occur, no major disasters can occur without us 
<br>
seeing it first-hand within minutes or hours of the event.
