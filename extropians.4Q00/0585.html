COGNITIVE SCIENCE IN PIECES
<br>
<a href="http://www.lucs.lu.se/People/David.de.Leon/Papers/Pieces.html">http://www.lucs.lu.se/People/David.de.Leon/Papers/Pieces.html</a>
<br>
<p>WHY A CLASSICS COURSE?
<br>
Why read cognitive science classics? Part of an answer to the question may be
<br>
provided by considering just one of the texts that we selected: the ubiquitously
<br>
cited 7±2 paper by Miller. It came to our attention that contrary to what seems
<br>
to be a generally accepted fact about this paper, it is not really about the
<br>
capacity of short-term memory. Furthermore, contrary to what is also widely
<br>
believed, the empirical evidence in the paper in support of this capacity is
<br>
neither strong nor abundant. This is striking considering that the scope of
<br>
short-term memory is arguably the most celebrated and most widely disseminated
<br>
fact this field has ever produced.
<br>
<em>&gt;From this example, there are several things to note. First of all there is what
</em><br>
the researchers claimed to do. Second, what they actually did, and third, the
<br>
way in which they have been subsequently portrayed in historical accounts of
<br>
cognitive science, and when referred to in contemporary contexts. Clearly, there
<br>
are all kinds of discrepancies. There is also merit to reading these original
<br>
texts as opposed to only having had contact with them via second-hand sources,
<br>
which tend to be sanitised distortions of the original ideas. Distortions which
<br>
often exceed those due to brevity and simplification. For instance, as pointed
<br>
out in the included paper by Brooks (1991), what was once known to be a
<br>
simplified statement, comes to pass as truth for later generations, and
<br>
underlying assumptions may be forgotten to be assumptions and become enshrined
<br>
as axioms. For these reasons and others, new generations tend to hold the
<br>
current position as 'self-evident,' and earlier ones to be so obviously wrong.
<br>
'How could anyone believe in that?' Typically, there were good reasons for
<br>
believing in just that. The real significance of a new approach may to a great
<br>
extent be missed, if the good reasons for believing in earlier ones are
<br>
forgotten.

Trends in Robot Control Architectures
<br>
<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~apendragn/trends.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~apendragn/trends.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Robot control architectures have changed and become more sophisticated in the
<br>
last few years. Early robot control systems attempted to utilize their knowledge
<br>
of the world to plan actions to situations. Because of the limited successes of
<br>
these systems in the real world, attempts were made to eliminate the
<br>
requirements for world knowledge altogether through the use of so-called
<br>
Reactive Planning Systems. Such systems demonstrated certain successes
<br>
immediately but their lack of sophistication became apparent. Some newer robot
<br>
control architectures attempt to combine reactive and planning systems and have
<br>
demonstrated sophistication with real-world capabilities.
