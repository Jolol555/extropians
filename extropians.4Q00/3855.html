<em>&gt; You could be a transhumanist of any of those brands (although some are more

</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion about this and the general view was (correctly IMO) that fascism 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand (1) our roots in humanism, and (2) the strong emphasis that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism places on individual choice.
</em><br>
<p>Responding to this post puts me in a difficult position.  I must
<br>
preface my claims by pointing out a couple of facts:
<br>
<p>1) I consider myself to be a transhumanist; I agree with a literal
<br>
interpretation of all of the articles in the Transhumanist
<br>
Declaration.
<br>
<p>2) I'm not a fascist.
<br>
<p>The reason that I must preface these claims is that I'm about to argue
<br>
that somebody could be a transhumanist and be a fascist, and, in doing
<br>
so, I'll suggest the sort of arguments that a fascist might make in an
<br>
attempt to show that he really is a transhumanist.  Since these are
<br>
the sort of arguments that a fascist would make, they will obviously
<br>
be positive towards fascism.
<br>
<p>I do not believe that these arguments are correct.  I merely intend to
<br>
show that someone could consistently hold them, could be an honest
<br>
fascist transhumanist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Regarding (1), consider the final clause in the Transhumanist Declaration 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.transhumanism.com/declaration.htm">http://www.transhumanism.com/declaration.htm</a>):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Transhumanism advocates the well-being of all sentience (whether in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial intellects, humans, non-human animals, or possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extraterrestrial species) and encompasses many principles of modern secular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanism.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppression of one group by another clearly violates the &quot;well-being of all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience&quot; clause. Moreover, if you read any summary of secular humanism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (you can find several on the web) you will see that it is totally contrary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fascist policies. (I know of just one instance of a self-ascribed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;fascist transhumanist&quot; and he is simply misusing the term &quot;transhumanist&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as much as if someone called himself a &quot;fascist extropian&quot;.)
</em><br>
<p>While I happen to agree with Article 7 of the Transhumanist
<br>
Declaration, I assert that it is not part of what it is essentially to
<br>
be a humanist or a transhumanist to respect non-human animal
<br>
sentience.  Indeed, many self-ascribed secular humanists emphasize the
<br>
absolute priority of human sentience over animal sentience.  (I'm sure
<br>
they didn't even consider artificial sentience or extraterrestrial
<br>
sentience.)
<br>
<p>Fascists have a notoriously restricted sense of what it is to be truly
<br>
human.  They have been known to sterilize persons with &quot;genetic
<br>
impurities&quot; and to enslave and imprision those whom they considered
<br>
&quot;subhuman.&quot;  We find this position appalling, but fascists do not.
<br>
<p>A fascist with a consistent restricted sense of what it is to be
<br>
&quot;human&quot; may argue that the domination of one race over another is
<br>
characteristic of the &quot;human&quot; character of one race relative to the
<br>
other less evolved or mutant race.  Were the fascist correct about
<br>
this definition of &quot;humanity,&quot; it would be no less implausible to
<br>
expect a humanist fascist than to expect a humanist who believed that
<br>
it was the right of humanity to dominate over horses, cattle, sheep,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>Again, this fascist argument is wrong, but saying so amounts to saying
<br>
that fascism is wrong, not that it is inconsistent with
<br>
(trans)humanism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Regarding (2), see e.g the following section from the FAQ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.transhumanist.org/#ethical">http://www.transhumanist.org/#ethical</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Is there any ethical standard by which transhumanists judge &quot;improvement 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the human condition&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanism is compatible with a variety of ethical systems, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanists themselves hold many different views. Nonetheless, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following seems to constitute a common core of agreement:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to transhumanists, the human condition has been improved if the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions of individual humans have been improved. In practice, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual is usually the judge of what is good for himself or herself. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, transhumanists advocate individual freedom, especially the moral 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right for those who so wish to do to use technology to extend their mental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and physical capacities and to improve their control over their own lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  From this perspective, an improvement to the human condition is a change 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that gives increased opportunity for individuals to shape themselves and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their lives according to their informed wishes. Notice the word &quot;informed&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is important that people are aware of what they are choosing between. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Education, freedom of information, information technology, idea futures, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and potentially intelligence amplification, can help people make choices 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are more informed. (Idea futures is a proposed market where people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would place bets on uncertain scientific hypotheses or predictions about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future, thus encouraging an honest consensus. Hanson (1990).)&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Even under a relatively normal definition of what it is to be human,
<br>
fascists usually also have (incorrect) consequentialist arguments in
<br>
favor of genocide and racial slavery, arguments that most individuals
<br>
benefit more than minorities are harmed by fascism.  They might argue
<br>
that a tiny minority (&quot;the Jews,&quot; for example,) has the character of
<br>
making life considerably worse for the rest of human society, and that
<br>
punishing members of this racial minority is as justifiable on the
<br>
grounds of human welfare as the punishment of a human criminal for his
<br>
crimes: though the criminal is human, punishing criminals makes life
<br>
better for all the rest of us.
<br>
<p>This fascist argument is wrong.  Although punishing criminals does
<br>
make us better off, harming minority groups does not improve human
<br>
welfare.  But if you believed that it did, you might consistently
<br>
argue that you do support the welfare of all of humanity, even under a
<br>
relatively normal definition of humanity, but insist that striking out
<br>
against racial minorities is good for the welfare of individuals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - It's worth emphasizing that just because transhumanism does not include 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something per definition, that doesn't mean that denying it is a reasonable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing to do for any individual transhumanist. For example, nothing in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism implies that the Earth is round, so in principle you could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a flat-earth-transhumanist. That would not be contradictory, just very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid. Similarly with some political beliefs. It would be a mistake, IMO, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to try to bake every reasonable belief into the definition of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism. That way lies dogma and futile system-building. Much better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see transhumanism for what it is - an evolving body of views and values 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relating to some of the issues raised to the prospect of radical human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancement technologies.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this.  Returning to my original point that transhumanism
<br>
is not extropic except to the extent that individual transhumanists
<br>
promote extropic ends, I think that we should be clear that being a
<br>
transhuman you can believe in a lot of silly things.  Extropy is a
<br>
relatively filled out point of view relative to transhumanism, so
<br>
while we should expect some overlap of extropy and transhumanism, we
<br>
should also expect some area of the transhumanist circle not to
<br>
overlap in any way with Extropianism.
