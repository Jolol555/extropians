<p>Yes.

<p>Yes, but so what?  We're talking about being restored in an emergency 
<br>
if your original body dies.  Within the confines of the original 
<br>
conjecture, you would barely notice a blip in your thoughts between 
<br>
when you were one place and when you were another.
<br>
<p>I passed out one time when I was giving blood.  One minute, I was 
<br>
sitting in a chair chatting with the nurse.  The next minute, I'm on 
<br>
a couch, being dabbed with a wet towel.  Oh my gosh!  I lost my 
<br>
consciousness thread that was running!  Life cannot go on... :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; Assuming that human beings are just biological computers, it should
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Undoubtedly this is possible, undoubtedly this will work, especially from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the point of view of the engineers &amp; admins building and running such
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Wouldn't the goal be to make the subjective experience in the new 
<br>
body unchanged from the memories of the previous subjective 
<br>
experience?  The more continuity, the better, I'd think.
<br>
<p>What would you be willing to accept in order to achieve immortality? 
<br>
A day of amnesia where you just don't remember that day - because you 
<br>
weren't alive?  Degradation of some of your memories from your old 
<br>
body?  What's a little schizophrenia in exchange for immortality? :)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
