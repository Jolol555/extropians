Only if you are not decisive and do not know what is important to you. I
<br>
could
<br>
probably make lots of money living in Silicon Valley. You couldn't get me to
<br>
live anywhere in California for a million bucks.
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
You are most welcome to your opinion but you are not welcome to call those
<br>
who decide differently &quot;indecisive&quot; or to assume we don't know ourselves and
<br>
our needs as well as you  know yourself.
<br>
<p>&lt;some snippage&gt;
<br>
<p>michael:
<br>
Currently we are seeing people whose Massachusetts welfare benefits have
<br>
expired
<br>
are being told to move to NH, which has a limit of 5 years, though the
<br>
benefits
<br>
are lower. These people would rather move to get lower benefits than go to
<br>
work,
<br>
and they seem to be able to afford the move as well. If they put as much
<br>
effort
<br>
into working as they do into not working, they could make a decent wage.
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
The assertion that all who want work can find it and at a decent wage needs
<br>
some support.  It is actually quite unlikely that especially the unskilled
<br>
will find work at a better wage than they can make on welfare.
