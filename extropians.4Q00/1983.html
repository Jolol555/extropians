</em><br>
<em>&gt; they point out the dangers of the technology, and spend some time
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; mention safeguards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am no hacking expert but it looks to me like there are some pretty
<br>
large holes in what I've heard of the broadcast architecture.  Not to
<br>
mention that it tends to more centralized control of technological
<br>
resources than I would like.  Developing safeguards is certainly
<br>
important but I wouldn't slow up building the fundamental tech too much
<br>
to design the end and be-all of safeguards.  &quot;Reasonable&quot; is the
<br>
keyword.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is Singularity Institute's counterpart to that?  Are yall thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safety?  Is there some kind of technology which would allow yall
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; fan of the HWoMBeP and all of yall, but if yall are rushing headlong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into unknown and dangerous technology without appropriate safety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measures (if such a term even applies) then I understand some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the criticism yall are getting.  spike
</em><br>
<p><p>There is no way to be really safe around SI that I know of.   What would
<br>
you do?  Only start up the SI in space with plenty of weaponry to knock
<br>
it out if it gets worrisome?  Seems to me there was some sci-fi along
<br>
those lines a while back.  It didn't work out so well.
