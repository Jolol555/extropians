<em>&gt;The market is a &quot;first price&quot; auction, where suppliers and utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt;companies offer and bid on electricity at a certain price per
</em><br>
<em>&gt;megawatt-hour (MWh).  With this kind of auction, whatever the highest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;price is for the last bit of electricity, that price is used for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the electricity sold during that time period.  So if some providers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;selling for $100/MWh, but that only covers 80% of requirements, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others are selling enough for $150 to cover 10% more, and then some are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;selling for $200 to cover the last 10%, everyone pays $200/MWh for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the electricity.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;All the power is being priced by the spot market? That seems strange
<br>
and probably foolish. Businesses that are dependent on commodities like
<br>
oil typically insulate themselves from some of the volatility by buying
<br>
a lot of their needs under multi-year fixed price contracts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The greater hope was for competition among power plant operators.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This seems to be what is breaking down.  At the time the California
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system was implemented, Californians were paying $100/MWh, twice the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;national rate.  After deregulation it went down for a while.  But starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this past summer the price has gone unstable and has had some extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;high peaks.  For the past two weeks it has been especially bad and has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reached over $1000/MWh some days.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;The high peak prices don't seem surprising. I would expect market pricing
<br>
to offset this by driving down prices during periods of low demand. I can't
<br>
tell whether this is actually happening.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's not known whether the power generators are colluding to keep the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;price this high.  IMO there are enough competitors in the market that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collusion seems unlikely.  People say that operators are pulling plants
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;How many independently owned producers are there? I'm aware of 2 large
<br>
publicly traded companies (Calpine and AES). I've heard a rumor that some
<br>
of the production is done by companies with the same parent that handles
<br>
the transmission.
<br>
&nbsp;I'm sure my information is incomplete, but it sounds like a fairly
<br>
concentrated industry, but not concentrated enough that end users would
<br>
have major problems getting reasonably competitive prices if they were
<br>
choosing spot market prices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I suspect that the real explanation is simply a matter of supply and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demand.  As Harvey says, demand is largely inelastic and doesn't change
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with price, since the prices aren't being passed through.  And supply has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been hampered due to delays in constructing new plants and environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regulations.  Any time you have a limited supply and inelastic demand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you will get price spikes as demand approaches supply.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I think even without the environmental regulations, it's easy to imagine
<br>
that companies that until recently have been monopolies would have
<br>
inadequately predicted the effects of the unusually long economic expansion.
