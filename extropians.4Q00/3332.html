<em>&gt;     &gt;a  copy is not the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the original is not the original, none of  the atoms in your body have
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; permanent home, everything is in a state of flux.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;The original, &quot;I&quot; , is what I'm concerned about-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You imply that you are &quot;the original I&quot; but I can't imagine why you think
</em><br>
that,
<br>
<em>&gt; you could be a copy made just 60 seconds ago. And anyway who cares,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what difference would it make to your subjective experience if you were,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or were not?
</em><br>
<p>If you created a copy of me right now, it would NOT be numerically identical
<br>
to ME.  It would be an independent being with it's own thoughts,
<br>
experiences, and state of being- it would, as I said, only be a copy, not be
<br>
myself, and would be conscious as an entity independent of myself.  If I had
<br>
to be destroyed in the process of creation, I would be gone forever.
<br>
<p>There would be no way of verifying this from an outsider's point of view,
<br>
however- the new being would believe that it was the old being in every way,
<br>
yet it would not be the old being, because it would not be the same observer
<br>
that the former being was.
<br>
<p>As I said, if you've seen &quot;The Sixth Day&quot;, think back to the part near the
<br>
end where the dying geneticist clones himself, and the half-completed clone
<br>
leaps out- and he immediately becomes aware that the clone is not him, just
<br>
a copy who believes that he is him- and that he is about to die.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I have not convinced you it's because you only saw a copy of this post,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you should have seen the original, it was great, you would have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinced for sure!
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but if the post was capable of thinking and feeling (which it just may
<br>
be ;)), and you were the post, the perspective on this situation would be
<br>
different.

<p>&quot;We do progress, but how?  Not by the tinkering of the meliorist; not by the
<br>
crushing of initiative; not by laws and regulations which hamstring the
<br>
racehorse, and handcuff the boxer; but by the innovations of the eccentric,
<br>
by the phantasies of the hashish-dreamer of philosophy, by the aspirations
<br>
of the idealist to the impossible, by the imagination of the revolutionary,
<br>
by the perilous adventure of the pioneer.  Progress is by leaps and bounds,
<br>
by breaking from custom, by working on untried experiments; in short, by the
<br>
follies and crimes of men of genius, only recognizable as wisdom and virtue
<br>
after they have been tortured to death, and their murderers reap gloatingly
<br>
the harvest of the seeds they sowed at midnight.&quot; -Aleister Crowley, &quot;On
<br>
Original Sin&quot;
