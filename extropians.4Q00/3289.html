</em><br>
<p>Here are the references to the four corners of the earth and other 
<br>
similar references.  Isaiah and Revelation refer to the four corners 
<br>
of the earth.  Other texts refer to the corners or four corners 
<br>
without being specific.
<br>
<p>Deuteronomy 32:26, &quot;I said, I would scatter them into corners, i 
<br>
would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:&quot;
<br>
<p>Nehemiah 9:22, &quot;Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and natins, and 
<br>
didst divide them into corners:  so they possessed the land of Sihon, 
<br>
and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of 
<br>
Bashan.&quot;
<br>
<p>Isaiah 11:12, &quot;And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and 
<br>
shall assemble the outcasts of Israel and gather together the 
<br>
dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.&quot;
<br>
<p>Jeremiah 9:26, &quot;Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of 
<br>
Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell 
<br>
in the wilderness:  for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all 
<br>
the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.&quot;
<br>
<p>Jeremiah 25:23, &quot;Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are in the 
<br>
utmost corners,&quot;
<br>
<p>Jeremiah 49:32, &quot;And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude 
<br>
of their cattle a spoil:  and I will scatter into all winds them that 
<br>
are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all 
<br>
sides thereof, saith the Lord.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ezekiel 7:2, &quot;Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God unto the 
<br>
land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four orners of the 
<br>
land.&quot;
<br>
<p>Revelation 7:1, &quot;And after these things I saw four angels standing on 
<br>
the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, 
<br>
that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on 
<br>
any tree.&quot;
