<p>My sense is that (to the extent it's not a matter of choice and local
<br>
prejudice) it's a developmental effect. It has been suggested that
<br>
upregulated cortisol titers in mothers, due to stress environments during
<br>
pregnancy, might serve as a trigger. Dunno the details, though.

<p>Two out of 6 kids in my family were born with (or maybe quickly developed)
<br>
an eye disorder known as `amblyopia' - a squint or turned eye. It looks
<br>
awful, and if not treated young leads to apoptosis in certain visual system
<br>
neural groups, causing loss of central focus in the affected eye and
<br>
preventing stereopsis. So I and my brother were fated from infancy to live
<br>
in a visually flat world. Luckily for him, he had the repair done in
<br>
childhood, and suffered nothing worse than the mockery and cruelty due to
<br>
any green monkey. But even if there's a genetic component in this
<br>
developmental pathway, I'm damned sure it's not selected for by either
<br>
individual or group selection. (Aw, shucks, but maybe it is after all--not
<br>
being able to see well enough to hunt and fight made me stay at home and do
<br>
all that detestable and unmanly book larnin'...)
