<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bill Gates could EASILY build and ship pre-fab housing to areas where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;needed, and greenhouses, hydroponics, what4ever is needed,
</em><br>
<p>But those who already have houses would legislate against it. In fact, in 
<br>
America, they already have, for much of the urban areas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;but NOOO he would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather shell out 42 million for a custom built home. That makes me sick 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I hear about human suffering. If I had the money, you couldn't STOP me from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doing something! Show the friggin aborigenes and rain forest tribes what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rest of the world is up to... break everyone out of this mystical belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that &quot;god&quot; will make everything ok. That is such an irrational way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looking at the world it makes me sick. Instead of taking your family to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;church, how about doing something meaningful with them? Irrational fear of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;death and hell has hampered FAR too many people in this world. It is time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for a real change. We do not live in the middle ages anymore. Instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having faith in something you can't see, have faith in people... the here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and now... hope... no... BELIEVE that the future will be bright and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motivation to help make it that way. We need to embrace our knowledge and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discard the petty. Racisim, bigotry, hatred... we are all soooo far above
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that. What is the point in it except to waste valueable and useful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(minds). We will never get there if we continue this self-destructive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ignorant, stupid, childish behavior. The time for humanity to grow up is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overdue. Our governments have as much to do with this as do each of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individually. Look at the difference in military spending versus say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humanitarian programs or space exploration. We are focussing on the &gt;WRONG
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that most of human behavior, maybe almost all of it, is 
<br>
actually, for the lack of a better phrase/word, &quot;unconscious.&quot; I mean that 
<br>
most behavior is really about gaining social status in order to better pass 
<br>
along one's DNA. So it seems irrational (because we prefer to think of 
<br>
ourselves as &quot;in control&quot;), but I think one can make a case for saying that 
<br>
we are for the most part, tools of our DNA, meat puppets, if you will.
<br>
<p>&lt;rest of world-class rant snipped&gt;
<br>
<p>I agree with most of what you say -- they are unconscious, I think you said. 
<br>
In fact, I  don't know why the rest of the world isn't on a lifelong 
<br>
drug-induced pleasure binge. They don't seem to care for radical life 
<br>
extension. As far as I can tell, they have nothing to live for (oh, yeah, 
<br>
their kids...see &quot;meat puppets&quot; above). They have, ultimately, only the void 
<br>
at the end. At least we have a chance. That is my motivation.
<br>
<p>So we must take control of our future. We must bend them to our will. Yeah, 
<br>
big fat chance there, huh?
<br>
<p>Perhaps, our views agree in that we feel that pure libertarianism is not 
<br>
really our best tool to implement our views, our path to the future. You 
<br>
mentioned killing all rest of them. Well, there goes that old social 
<br>
contract, etc. But yes, they not only do not share our views, but are 
<br>
inimical to them, in many ways. Ultimately, public relations -- propaganda 
<br>
-- is our best tool, IMO.
