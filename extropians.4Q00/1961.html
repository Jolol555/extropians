</em><br>
<p>Heh.  Yeah, some of his ideas are okay, but old hat- of *course*, if you
<br>
have fractal robots (the basic idea dating back to Hans Moravec's
<br>
&quot;christmas bush&quot; concept) you can do very fine grain mechanical labor. 
<br>
As I see it, JM has overall negative value, by adding no useful new
<br>
creative concepts with a huge ration of bogosity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I started to include some other more &quot;mainstream&quot; shape changing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modular, etc. robot sites just to show that the idea is being worked on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by people who are not &quot;loons&quot; but I figured everyone knew that already.
</em><br>
<p>For completeness,

<br>
<p><em>&gt; JM's ideas for agriculture make a great deal more sense to me than eating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poisoned food.
</em><br>
<p>...but they aren't original with him.  Twenty years ago Robert Forward
<br>
described a fractal robot working in the garden aboard a starship- the
<br>
idea ain't new, or even startling.  Think of a fractal or fog robot as
<br>
being the ultimate in coolie labor.  Hand groomed food certainly would
<br>
be of high quality, I agree.
