That's 'Butler' with one 't' :) And we'll see how XLink scales.
<br>
<p>Assuming that it works, that leaves at least three-and-a-fraction of
<br>
Ted's criticisms of HTML/XML intact.
<br>
<p>On the other side of the fence: none of the Xanies would have predicted
<br>
the widespread implementation and immense success and popularity of
<br>
*free* search engines. Free? Are you *nuts*? :)
<br>
<p>I am hoping that some of the XLink implementers will at least glance at
<br>
the Udanax open source. But I don't expect it.
