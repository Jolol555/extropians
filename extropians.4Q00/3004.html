<p><em> &gt; Gnutella's woes demonstrate that making a scalable, usable peer to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; peer file sharing system is not as easy as it looks.  In retrospect it
</em><br>
<p>Gnutella's woes demonstrate clearly is that if you take a broken
<br>
protocol written by an idiot (Napster) and try to make it
<br>
peer-to-peer/headless without any modifications it will break horribly
<br>
all over the place. Duh. Napster/Gnutella is really, really broken. It
<br>
totally ignores prior art addressing these obvious problems, and a
<br>
number of projects (I'm really looking forward to run MojoNation) did
<br>
so and do it much better.
<br>
<p>Otoh, Napster created the user nucleus with usable criticality, and
<br>
thus amplified the meme all over the place. Subsequent efforts don't
<br>
have to explain themselves, just tap into existing infrastructure with
<br>
a (preferably, one-way) gateway, and declare &quot;we're the better
<br>
Napster&quot;. As soon as the new service reaches criticality as enough
<br>
users install the clients, you break the (vulnerable, since traceable)
<br>
connecting gateways, and go fully autonomous.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; is amazing that Napster was able to do so well.  Of course the other
</em><br>
<p>IIRC, Gnutella's problem is that it uses a Napster protocol without
<br>
caching indexes (Napster runs over a central server, so it doesn't
<br>
have to deal with that query amplification problem). Each query gets
<br>
amplified to essentially the entire network. A major fraction of
<br>
people are 1) freeloader scum 2) run 56k modems 3) don't use
<br>
lightweight query coding, so packets are large.  So each query got
<br>
amplified a lot, and eventually clogs the bandwidth of your modem
<br>
given a relatively modest size of nodes. Finis, the network fragments
<br>
in several subnetworks -- each of them are still operational, however.
<br>
<p>An SDSL line gives you an order of magnitude larger bandwidth (and a
<br>
much smaller latency) than a 56k modem, and hence would not saturate
<br>
so easily. A rewrite, where each node caches the common index of next
<br>
few neighbour (few-hop) nodes (resulting into a bit of initial setup
<br>
time/initial travel spike before your peer will accept your queries)
<br>
would let the whole saturation problem disappear into thin air.
<br>
<p>This simple measures (advent of xDSL and a protocol patch) do not
<br>
address the other pressing problems, however. Did I already mention
<br>
that Napster/Gnutella is b0rken?
<br>
<p><em> &gt; There are a dozen or more other P2P systems out there that I don't know
</em><br>
<em> &gt; anything about.  This fragmentation is itself a problem because these
</em><br>
<em> &gt; systems have to reach critical mass to be useful.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the mini overview. I think we can agree that the problems
<br>
currently plaguing P2P share are not fundamental, and are IMO already
<br>
adequately addressed in several existing and forthcoming packages,
<br>
albeit probably not all in a single one.
<br>
<p>The demand is certainly there, and since steganography and remixing
<br>
will make the resulting network both unfilterable and untraceable, we
<br>
can probably also agree that you can't stop the emergence of global
<br>
P2P neither at technical nor at legal level. The only way to stop it
<br>
would be to rip out existing infrastructure, and substitute it with a
<br>
lawnik-mandated one, while also inserting multiple probes into user's
<br>
orifices. I think it is easy to see that this won't happen.
<br>
<p>As soon as the beta code bugs are ironed out, any digitized or
<br>
digitazable IP for which there is a demand for in a negligeable
<br>
fraction of entire participants will be on the network. I'm not
<br>
worried about music or texts (street performer procol &amp; Co), I'm
<br>
worried about movies, which are real expensive to make. (But I never
<br>
liked Hollywood, anyway. They may all burn in hell for what I'm
<br>
concerned).
<br>
<p>I think the net result will be a win. But we'll find out soon enough,
<br>
anyway.
