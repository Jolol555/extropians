<p>
As long term list members will recall, we have had some acrimonious
<br>
debates with David Brin on this list about his attitudes towards privacy.
<br>
He ran into similar highly negative responses from others in the online
<br>
community.
<br>
<p>I believe it is this issue which has brought him to his present meta-
<br>
analysis of attitudes and ideologies.  It was a terrible shock to him
<br>
to find himself accused of supporting tyranny and wanting to quash the
<br>
freedom of individuals to communicate privately.  He didn't really think
<br>
of himself as tyrant material.
<br>
<p>So he has launched a meta ideological battle on a number of fronts,
<br>
arguing against ideology itself in favor of pragmatic compromise.  He also
<br>
seems to be attacking individualist philosophy.  His mantra, &quot;I am a
<br>
member of a civilization&quot; is meant to remind us of how we owe to others.
<br>
<p>Personally, I consider the ideas Brin is pushing to be significant
<br>
threats to the values which are most important to me.  I don't want to
<br>
demonize the guy, but based strictly on his current writings I have to
<br>
view him as an enemy.  I hope people can see past the smiling face and
<br>
jokey writing style to recognize the importance and seriousness of the
<br>
issues he is raising.  David Brin is a dedicated and sincere ideological
<br>
warrior who is fighting a long-term, well-planned campaign to use his
<br>
writing skills to influence public opinion.
<br>
