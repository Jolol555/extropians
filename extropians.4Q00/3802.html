Hi spike and Extropians,

<em>&gt; &gt; Robert Bradbury).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WOW cooool, Drexler, Bradbury, spike.  There are three names I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to see mentioned in the same sentence.
</em><br>
<p>I feel I am almost in the presence of three gods . . .
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Heres how I figure: an astronaut is usually at least 30 and human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life expectancy is about 75, so 45 years to cover... lets see, the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; deceleration phases.
</em><br>
<p>What are octogenarians going to do in a distant star system?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming away the inherent difficulties in actually pushing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vehicle to that speed, the erosion as a function of interstellar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter becomes a hell of a problem.  I did a calc today assuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an iceberg shield up front, as in Clarke's Songs of Distant Earth.
</em><br>
(snip)
<br>
<em>&gt; The erosion rate I got for .1c was on the order of a cm a day,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using some admittedly rough estimates.
</em><br>
<p>Don't panic, spike; may I suggest some more things to try . . .
<br>
<p>1.  Metallic shield --&gt; takes a lot more damage, although it has more mass.
<br>
2.  Stong magnetic field shields to divert any charged particles away from
<br>
the ship.
<br>
3.  Make the ship very long and thin, so there is not so much area for the
<br>
dust to strike.
<br>
4.  Don't resist the particles; use them as fuel!  Eg, fusion torch.
<br>
<p>And thats only the ones I can think of right now.  Any others, guys?
<br>
<p>(snip)
<br>
<em>&gt; to cross.  If there is no unknown technology {such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opening a temporary wormhole}, then we are left with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two technologically daunting paths for crossing interstellar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space: either 1)  multigeneration ships far from any energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source, or 2)  very high speeds, in which interstellar dust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and gas would grind our ship to powder.
</em><br>
<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Are we forgetting suspended animation here?  It should
<br>
allow a slow ship (if a fast one is impossible to make) to use very lttle
<br>
energy on life support, and still deliver perfectly healthy young astronauts
<br>
to the stars.
<br>
Sure its not been shown to work yet, but neither do I see any generation
<br>
ships or even space vehicles capable of approaching 0.1 psol.
<br>
<p>Up, up and atom!
<br>
