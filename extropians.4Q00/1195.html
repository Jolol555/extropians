<p><em>&gt; She has the heart of a lion: accustomed to overcoming enormous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  challenges every single day of her life, and has come thru like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  true champion she is. 
</em><br>
<p><p>Just a few minutes ago I left a little resturant in southern texas.  The guy 
<br>
busing the tables was built like mike tyson...from the waist up...his legs 
<br>
were terribly thin...small...malformed...and had poor motorcontrol....
<br>
<p>He mostly used his arms to get around...his legs were basicly useless...how 
<br>
he balanced on them was beyond me....his upper body was massively musceled..
<br>
<p>he perservered...
<br>
<p>One of my online acquaintances has a microencelphic sister...the sister is 
<br>
55...she was not expected to have lived past age six...
<br>
<p>They perservere...
<br>
<p>In my home town in the panhandle of Texas is a lady who has very poor control 
<br>
of her muscels...I dunno what it's called..but she reminds me of pictures 
<br>
I've seen of Steven Hawkins....she moves jerkily...and it's difficult to 
<br>
understand her speach...
<br>
<p>She sells Avon door to door ...she rides around town on an electric three 
<br>
wheel bicycle....with a whip antenna on the rear sporting a red warning 
<br>
flag....
<br>
<p>She perservers...
<br>
<p>I have a five year old grandson who is deaf in most of the speech 
<br>
frequencies....he gives his older sister fits...is a whiz on the 
<br>
computer...and is picking up sign language amazingly fast....
<br>
<p><p>&quot;I wept because I had no shoes....until I met a man who had no feet&quot;
<br>

<br>
In a Rest Area...Somewhere along US 77 in South Texas....
