When I said that Libertarianism requires a moral revolution, I was
<br>
pointing out the rather obvious fact that if everybody around you
<br>
believes that it is one's moral duty to relinquish one's freedoms, you
<br>
included, they'll (surprise!) start up a government and initiate force
<br>
against you.
<br>
<p>People have to vote libertarian, that is, they have to vote to
<br>
dismantle the government, or revolt, or whatever, or else the
<br>
government will exist and meddle (as people currently vote for it to
<br>
do).  But they'll never do that unless their morals change rather
<br>
drastically.
<br>
<p>Samantha argued that it doesn't require that everyone get it... it
<br>
simply requires that everyone let everyone else alone (unless they
<br>
initiate force).  In other words, they don't have to understand
<br>
libertarianism, they just have to be libertarians in action.  That
<br>
sounds like a moral revolution to me.  It's not happening this week, I
<br>
promise you that.
<br>
<p>Similarly, Michael Lorrey said that all it takes is for self defense
<br>
to be acceptable and for the initiation of force to be unacceptable.
<br>
But I don't know what sort of acceptability one would be talking about
<br>
unless it were either legal acceptability or moral acceptability.
<br>
Legal acceptability would follow only from moral acceptability; the
<br>
people must choose to act to prevent initiation of force.  Now they
<br>
believe that it's everyone's moral duty to accept certain kinds of
<br>
initiations of force and to initiate force against others under
<br>
various conditions.  This would have to change before libertarianism
<br>
started to happen.
<br>
<p>I'm saying that people have to decide to get out of everyone else's
<br>
way for libertarianism to happen.  They don't want that.  They want to
<br>
be controlled, and they want you to be controlled as well.  Unless
<br>
they change their minds on that, unless there's a moral revolution, it
<br>
won't happen.
