<p><em>&gt;Amazing.  In 1974-75 I attended junior high in New York City, a &quot;decent&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neighborhood in Bayside, Queens.  Brawling was something I became
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proficient at, whether I wanted to or not- 
</em><br>
<p>As they say in real estate, &quot;Location, location, location.&quot;
<br>
<p>I went to high school in Israel in the early 70's.  We had barbed wire around
<br>
our school, we were taught never to pick up stray objects off the ground, we
<br>
had mandatory pre-military training in school (including marksmanship), our 
<br>
teachers were armed on field trips, and the Yom Kippur War totally reorganized 
<br>
11th grade.
<br>
<p>But there were no fights in my school.  Ever.  The only weapons kids carried 
<br>
were pocket knives for a throwing game we played at recess.  No one I knew had
<br>
ever been arrested for anything; it was inconceivable that anyone would be.
<br>
<p>My daughter is now in high school, in a large city in New Hampshire.  There 
<br>
are fights at school; she walks around them.  There are trouble-makers; she
<br>
avoids them.  The only weapons incidents I've heard of were at a junior high 
<br>
in a poorer end of town, and made front-page news in the paper.
<br>
<p>According to a police lieutenant I spoke with, the 9th graders get away with 
<br>
a lot.  (Not clear why.)  Then they go to the high school for 10th grade, which 
<br>
has a zero-tolerance policy.  In the first two months of each fall, the police 
<br>
arrest 65-70 kids, 90% of whom are incoming sophomores.  They either straighten 
<br>
up fast or are gone.  The whole rest of the year, there are only 15 arrests for
<br>
the entire school.
<br>
<p>No metal detectors, no chains on the doors.  Some of the zero-tolerance is
<br>
absurd -- no blue bandannas, no South Park &quot;I killed Kenny&quot; shirts -- but it
<br>
seems to work.  Everyone has to wear an ID badge at all times.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, ten minutes to our south, in Taxachusetts, is an old industrial 
<br>
town.  Roughly the same size population but requiring six times the police 
<br>
force.  Poverty, welfare, crime, violence, drugs.  A friend of mine grew up 
<br>
there.  *He* has stories about high school knifings.
<br>
<p>Any stories from the non-US contingent?  (I imagine high school in Sweden is
<br>
markedly different than in Oz.)
