<em>&gt; about a supposed reactionless drive.  It seems that when you turn on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superconducting magnet, and there is some metal in the magnetic field,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the magnet shakes with a &quot;jolt&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Goodwin says the metal objects create the judder effect by inducing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    a &quot;brief asymmetry in the magnetic field&quot; as it is set up when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    magnet is turned on. This initial disturbance of the magnetic field,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    he says, creates a repulsive force on the magnet and pushes it away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't it obvious that this is just action and reaction?  Whatever force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the magnet fields, the metal which induces the force will feel an equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Somehow they think this means they can have a reactionless drive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It doesn't make any sense to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shades of the Lorrey drive....
</em><br>
<p>Sorry Hal, no, the Lorrey Drive is a matter of a loophole in Mach's
<br>
Principle described by Prof John Cramer, and is not a truly reactionless
<br>
drive either, even under relativistic conditions. What is decribed above
<br>
does seem to be a reaction drive as well, since it involves the key
<br>
phrase of 'pushing away'. 
<br>
<p>A true reactionless drive would pull itself through space without any
<br>
kind of traction whatsoever and would be powered by a self contained
<br>
power source. Thermodynamics only requires that you either conserve mass
<br>
or you conserve energy, it does not mandate you do both at the same
<br>
time, as is proven by relativity.
