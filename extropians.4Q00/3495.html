<em>&gt;     &gt; you'll note my emphasis of the word &quot;particular.&quot;  As it stands, MY
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; discrete experience of reality is contained within a -particular-
</em><br>
pattern.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A pattern is nothing but information, if it's the same information then
</em><br>
it's
<br>
<em>&gt; the same particular pattern.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry dude, you can keep saying this 'till the cows come home, but if I
<br>
delete my mp3 of my favorite Metallica song, I'm fairly certain your
<br>
collection will remain unscathed.  My version is a *discrete copy* with a
<br>
reality independent of yours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Unless you are proposing a means by which that particular discrete
</em><br>
reality
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; experiencer is able to transition to a new substrate,
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I am proposing such a mechanism,  use a pattern to know how to arrange off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the shelf atoms in the same way they were before, the result is another
</em><br>
you.
<br>
<p>This is not a transition John-- there is no movement of the consciousness.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     &gt; *I* (by definition)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to hear what your definition of &quot;I&quot; is. I'll give you two of
</em><br>
mine,  both work pretty well.
<br>
<em>&gt; 1) I am John Clark's thoughts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) I am matter that behaves in a John Clarkian way.
</em><br>
<p>Discrete reality experiencer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; Well, that's sort of a fast and loose definition of death,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Except for pure mathematics I don't think precise definitions are very
</em><br>
important but
<br>
<em>&gt; If you have a better definition of death than having a last thought I'd
</em><br>
love to hear it.
<br>
<p>Death = Permanent termination of the experience of reality. (I can offer
<br>
further precision if you want to investigate my usage of the term
<br>
&quot;reality.&quot;)  Perhaps you can envision modalities into which we might evolve
<br>
where the concept of &quot;having a thought&quot; is irrelevant to our existence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;its difficult to even call the new pattern MY thoughts, since they
</em><br>
are discrete
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;from the original.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's discrete about it?
</em><br>
<p>Necessarily seperate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  And what's &quot;the original&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>The one with which we started.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     &gt; What if you were to make 10 copies?  Would they all be my thoughts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly, they would all be Jason Joel Thompson's thoughts.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As time progressed they would start to diverge into different people due
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; differences in the environment they experience or just because of random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fluctuations, but at the instant they were made they'd all be you.
</em><br>
<p>How long is that instant?  Is there an actual effective reality in which
<br>
they are all &quot;me?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; How are you transferring my subjective experience of reality across
</em><br>
the two
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; humans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Superbly.
</em><br>
<p>HOW?  Magic?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;If you don't destroy the original, do I somehow get to experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;both realities simultaneously in a single brain?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only if both of you are in a identical environment, but then experiencing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two identical environments is undistinguishable from experiencing one.
</em><br>
<p>In what -scientific- fashion is one of the brains simultaneously doing what
<br>
you describe above, and what possible substance does it have?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; you could create such a copy covertly and I, unawares, could walk
</em><br>
out onto
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; the street and get hit by a bus-- does my subjective experience then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; mysteriously jump across to the clone?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, assuming the copy was made a nanosecond before the bus hit.
</em><br>
<p>By what science does my subjective experience mysteriously jump across to
<br>
the clone?  Why is it important that the copy was made within a single
<br>
nanosecond?
<br>
<p><p>Let me get this straight:  is it your contention that my discrete experience
<br>
of reality will, at the instant of impact, jump across to the (just
<br>
activated) copy?
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;     &gt;You -will- have pleasing and  effective results if the copying
</em><br>
resolution is
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;fine-grained enough-- I don't  dispute that.  But should you leave
</em><br>
the 'original'
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;intact, you now have TWO  discrete experiencers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's cut to the chase, there is one way and one way only that could be
</em><br>
true,
<br>
<em>&gt; if the holly rollers turned out to be right and the human soul exists. I
</em><br>
consider
<br>
<em>&gt; the likelihood of that to be too low to worry about
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  As far as I'm concerned, -you're- the one who believes in a human
<br>
soul-- there's got to be *something* making that mystical jump across into
<br>
the new substrate, since you aren't proposing any science to handle it.
<br>
<p>Belief in a soul might support your contention that there is only ONE
<br>
discrete experiencer around after a copy is made-- personally I believe that
<br>
we can clone discrete entities to our heart's content without worrying
<br>
whether God has enough souls to hand out.
