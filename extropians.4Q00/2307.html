</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since Extropians fix broken things, I thought I'd toss out a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PROBLEM: The ballot in Florida may have confused some voters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SOLUTION: A national standard balloting system, open standard, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           all may participate equally.
</em><br>
<p>I've seen the ballots used, the butterfly ballots used are the SAME type used in
<br>
Bill Daley's home turf of Cook County, Illinois. The dems have complained about
<br>
the arrows on them being 'confusing', when it is the arrows that are the LEAST
<br>
confusing thing about that ballot, and are likely its saving grace.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PROBLEM: The media may have influenced the outcome of the vote.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SOLUTION: Ban all media from polling places, ban all media
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           discussion of election results till all polls have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           closed.
</em><br>
<p>Media, parties, and special interest groups should be banned from announcing
<br>
results until officially announced (which should be after all polls are closed).
<br>
Our right to vote uninflenced and unfettered is more important than their right
<br>
to free speech. How could this be accomplished? Simple: Declare that any media
<br>
announcing a state is for one candidate prior to the polls closing is to be
<br>
treated as campaign contributions to that candidate (and any contribution over
<br>
the corporate limit is, by definition an illegal donation). Candidates that
<br>
accept illegal donations and do not return them prior to the election are to be
<br>
invalidated as legal candidates. Any media or group can be exempted from these
<br>
rules if they can certify that neither they, their parent or subsidiary
<br>
corporations, or any employees, employees spouses,  employees dependents, or
<br>
stockholders/trustees/directors/members have contributed to the campaigns.
