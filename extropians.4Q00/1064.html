<em>&gt; legal system?

<br>
deciding whether an organization qualifies as a tax-exempt &quot;church&quot;.

<br>
the reasons for its formation.
<br>
<p>2 Does the organization have a written creed or statement of faith? Yes No
<br>
If “Yes,” attach a copy.
<br>
<p>3 Does the organization require prospective members to renounce other
<br>
religious beliefs or their membership in other churches or religious orders
<br>
to become members? No Yes
<br>
<p>4 Does the organization have a formal code of doctrine and discipline for
<br>
its members? Yes No
<br>
If “Yes,” describe.
<br>
<p>5 Describe the form of worship and attach a schedule of worship services.
<br>
<p>6 Are the services open to the public? No Yes
<br>
If “Yes,” describe how the organization publicizes its services and
<br>
explain the criteria for admittance.
<br>
<p>7 Explain how the organization attracts new members.
<br>
<p>8 (a) How many active members are currently enrolled in the church?
<br>
(b) What is the average attendance at the worship services?
<br>
<p>9 In addition to worship services, what other religious services
<br>
(such as baptisms, weddings, funerals, etc.) does the organization conduct?
<br>
<p>10 Does the organization have a school for the religious instruction of the
<br>
young? Yes No
<br>
<p>11 Were the current deacons, minister, and/or pastor formally ordained after
<br>
a prescribed course of study? No Yes
<br>
<p>12 Describe the organization’s religious hierarchy or ecclesiastical
<br>
government.
<br>
<p>13 Does the organization have an established place of worship? Yes No
<br>
If “Yes,” provide the name and address of the owner or lessor of the
<br>
property and the address and a description of the facility.
<br>
If the organization has no regular place of worship, state where the
<br>
services are held and how the site is selected.
<br>
<p>14 Does (or will) the organization license or otherwise ordain ministers
<br>
(or their equivalent) or issue church charters? No Yes
<br>
If “Yes,” describe in detail the requirements and qualifications needed to
<br>
be so licensed, ordained, or chartered.
<br>
<p>15 Did the organization pay a fee for a church charter? Yes No
<br>
If “Yes,” state the name and address of the organization to which the fee
<br>
was paid, attach a copy of the charter, and describe the circumstances
<br>
surrounding the chartering.
<br>
<p>16 Show how many hours a week the minister/pastor and officers each devote
<br>
to church work and the amount of compensation paid to each of them. If
<br>
the minister or pastor is otherwise employed, indicate by whom employed,
<br>
the nature of the employment, and the hours devoted to that employment.
