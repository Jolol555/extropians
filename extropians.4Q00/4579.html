<p>
Everybody likes 2001, Alien, T1/T/2 and Blade Runner so I'll just talk about some of
<br>
the lesser known movies that I think are gems.
<br>
<p>* Forbidden Planet: Corny dialogue and poor acting can't stop this from being
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a  terrific movie, because it has one of the best story premises ever put on film.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People land on a planet and investigate why half a million years ago an alien race
<br>
&nbsp;that was advancing technologically at a accelerating pace mysteriously disappeared
<br>
&nbsp;overnight. This may sound like familiar territory but remember the movie was talking
<br>
&nbsp;about the singularity  way back in 1956.  State of the art  special effects for its day,
<br>
&nbsp;and not bad even for today. Also it was the first movie ever made with an  all electronic
<br>
&nbsp;musical score, and it's  aged well, it still sounds properly creepy. However if they ever
<br>
&nbsp;remake it I hope  they dump  the very  last scene, that sucked. Why does the object
<br>
&nbsp;of wonder always  have to blow up at the end?
<br>
<p>* The Forbin Project: Came out about 1970.  Great story, great dialogue,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;great acting, great sets, great music, it's a mystery to me why nobody
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;knows about this masterpiece. The best part is the ending, it's exactly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;what it should be, but not what you're expecting.
<br>
<p>* The Lathe of Heaven: Made by PBS about 20 years ago. I thought it was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;excellent but Isaac Asimov hated it. I agree with his criticism of one brief
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;line of dialogue but that wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me, I still like it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The move just came out on video after being unavailable and stuck in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copyright hell for 2 decades.
<br>
<p>* Defending Your Life: A fantasy comedy, and a very funny one. I kept thinking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of Tipler's Omega Point. It was made 5 or 6 years ago so you can probably
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;find it on video.
<br>
<p>* Fearless: Not Science Fiction at all, just the story of a man who confronts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mortality and survives a airplane crash. Maybe I'm reading too much into it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;but I thought I could see some &gt;H ideas, and if not, it's still a excellent  movie.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a few years old and on video.
<br>
<p>*Being John Malkovich: Deals  with qualia, identity, and immortality, not something
<br>
&nbsp;you see every day, especially in a very funny comedy.  No fancy special effects,
<br>
&nbsp;just first rate writing acting and direction.
<br>
<p>* The Thirteenth Floor: Came out at the same time as The Matrix and has the same
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basic premise, it's not as spectacular visually and not nearly as well known, but may
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be a better movie.
