<em>&gt; This is a bit strange considering that you are already consume 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based products from animals fed foods quite saturated with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pesticides. 
</em><br>
<p>No, actually for the most part I don't.  Because of severe drought, I've
<br>
recently had to buy more of my food than I normally would, but I've made
<br>
a point to purchase vegetables and grains grown without pesticides and to
<br>
either eat animals I've raised myself (although I find it difficult to
<br>
kill the goats, I don't at all mind killing fish and chickens) or beef
<br>
raised on pesticide free pastures. Likewise, the cow's milk I buy is from
<br>
clean pastures, and the cows are not routinely given antibiotics and are
<br>
never given bovine growth hormone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point of modifying a plant genetically to produce its own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pesticide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that it produces just enough (and if possible of a happier 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemical)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for its needs. 
</em><br>
<p>If you can point me to the source on which you're basing the above
<br>
statement I'd be interested in reading it. I'm not aware that any testing
<br>
has been done to determine what is &quot;just enough.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;This results in much lower concentration of 
<br>
<em>&gt; pesticides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than non-genetic means like spraying crops. 
</em><br>
<p>Again, I'd be interesting in taking a look at your source.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;The latter is a shotgun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach and likely to result in much higher health risks and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accidental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contamination of nearby lifeforms.
</em><br>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, there have been at least a couple of
<br>
unexpected cases of cross pollination with related wild species. I don't
<br>
buy the idea that the genetic approach is less likely to result in
<br>
contamination.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Exactly.  Old style pesticide use is much more dangerous.  However, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of pesticides must be used to have effective crop yields. 
</em><br>
<p>Again, I'd be interested to see your source for this statement. It
<br>
certainly does not match with my experience or the experience of many
<br>
other gardeners and farmers I know. To the contrary, as far as I know, 
<br>
yields obtained through &quot;conventional&quot; agricultural methods have been
<br>
decreasing.  Pests tend to become resistant to pesticides, which means
<br>
more and more have to be used. I would expect the same thing to happen
<br>
with the GM corn after a certain number of generations.
<br>
<p>Please note that I am not against the GM crops in general. But I'm not at
<br>
all pleased with the direction most of the applications are going. It
<br>
strikes me as quite strange that people who claim to want long and
<br>
healthy lives would not be more concerned about the quality of food they
<br>
eat.  I agree that mildly poisoned food is better than no food at all.
<br>
But why not strive for the healthiest food possible. 
<br>
<p>I recently came across a suggested agricultural application of fractal
<br>
robots which caught my attention.  IMO THIS is the way to deal with
<br>
pests. I'll try to find it and post it to the list.
