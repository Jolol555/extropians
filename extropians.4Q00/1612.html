The July issue of Scientific American had an article on the Fermi Paradox 
<br>
written by Ian Crawford, and entitled appropriately, &quot;Where are they?&quot;  
<br>
<p>It can be found online at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/2000/0700issue/0700crawford.html">http://www.scientificamerican.com/2000/0700issue/0700crawford.html</a>
<br>
<p>A sidebar by Andrew J. LePage entitled &quot;Where could they hide?&quot;, at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/2000/0700issue/0700crawfordbox1.html">http://www.scientificamerican.com/2000/0700issue/0700crawfordbox1.html</a>
<br>
<p>is a discussion of the seti search.  Both pieces are quite astute, but also 
<br>
hopelessly conventional.
<br>
<p>LePage says:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No SETI program has ever found a verifiable alien radio signal. What does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that null result mean? &lt;snip&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;researchers can draw some preliminary conclusions about the number and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological sophistication of other civilizations.
</em><br>
<p>Balderdash, I say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The most thoroughly examined frequency channel to date, around 1.42
</em><br>
gigahertz, 
<br>
<em>&gt;corresponds to the emission line of the most common element in the universe, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hydrogen--on the premise that if extraterrestrials had to pick some
</em><br>
frequency 
<br>
<em>&gt;to attract our attention, this would be a natural choice. 
</em><br>
<p>Assuming they're trying to get our attention, and they think as the seti
<br>
people think.  
<br>
Quite an assumption!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&lt;snip&gt;No signal has ever been detected, which means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that any civilizations either are out of range or do not transmit with
</em><br>
enough 
<br>
<em>&gt;power to register on our instruments. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The null results therefore rule out certain types of civilizations, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;including primitive ones close to Earth and advanced ones farther away.
</em><br>
<p>I can't believe this guy is serious.  What about, &quot;rules out the correctness 
<br>
of your search assumptions&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of the transmitters. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;EIRP is essentially the transmitter power divided by the fraction of the sky 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the antenna covers. In the case of an omnidirectional transmitter, the EIRP 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is equal to the transmitter power itself. The most powerful on this planet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is currently the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico, which could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;used as a narrowly beamed radar system with an EIRP of nearly 1014 watts.
</em><br>
<p>Which brings me to my point.  Arecibo with a narrow beam has an EIRP of 
<br>
nearly 10^14 watts.  Fine.  Suppose they're not trying to signal us.  Then
<br>
what 
<br>
is the EIRP.  Or to put it another way, from beyond the earth what does the 
<br>
earth look like, strengthwise, as a radio source--make that an EM source--at 
<br>
any and all frequencies.  Without the Arecibo single frequency pencil beam 
<br>
concept (Asfpbc), what are we dealing with?  And does it seem to anyone but 
<br>
me, that drawing conclusions based on the Asfpbc is a kind of way forced and 
<br>
unrealistically particular foundation for drawing conclusions?  Specifically 
<br>
EXPECTING the highest possible signal strength.  On what basis?  Because 
<br>
you want to hear them.  Hypothesizing that they run their culture to
<br>
facilitate 
<br>
your discovery of them, pegs my 'whacko&quot; meter.  I know I must have gotten 
<br>
it wrong, but the analysis as put forward seems to tend that way.  Someone 
<br>
who knows about seti (not me) might clear this up.
<br>
<p>More realistically, at what distance from our solar sytem does Earth's human 
<br>
generated EM radiation fall to the level of weak and unrecognizable noise?  
<br>
In my view, that is the distance limit for drawing meaningful conclusions
<br>
about 
<br>
the presence of a human equivalent et civilization.
<br>
<p>When I first read the article, I thought about it, and asked myself about
<br>
what 
<br>
the strongest signal would be--the signal which would give the greatest 
<br>
detectable range by which an affirmative conclusion might be drawn.  I 
<br>
thought perhaps the EM pulse from a naked nuclear explosion would be 
<br>
both the strongest, as well as the signal most undeniably indicative of a 
<br>
technological civilization.  Clearly, such a signal would be brief.  But 
<br>
assuming that to be the best signature by which others might detect OUR 
<br>
presence, I did a little research into the amount of such 'signaling' that we 
<br>
have done.  It turns out that in the period between 1945 and 1998 humans 
<br>
have conducted 2,050 nuclear explosions, of which 528 have been atmospheric, 
<br>
and 1522 undergound.  If the EM pulse lasts for one tenth of a second (this 
<br>
is just a guess, I leave it to others to help out with something more
<br>
authoritative), 
<br>
that would mean 52.8 seconds of strong, unambiguous signal.  Fifty-three 
<br>
seconds in fifty years.  Using Arecibo's 10^14 watts as a basis of
<br>
comparison, 
<br>
what might be the signal strength, and corresponding detection range for a 
<br>
nuclear explosion?  Perhaps the answer should be given as a range,
<br>
corresponding 
<br>
to the range of detonation yields? 
<br>
