<em>&gt; pipes up (pun intended) - maybe he'll give us more details about XCOR's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimate plans and 2) saying 'go nanotech!' will probably make me look

like a
<br>
<em>&gt; passive singulatarian.&quot;  So, some clarifications and responses.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you have to admit, too many people rely on some future prediction to
<br>
get them out of a tight spot.  You know, the types who say, &quot;I have a
<br>
cryonics policy, so why bother taking supplements, eating right, or
<br>
exercising?&quot;  (No offense to the cryonics community.  Even so, I've met
<br>
people like exactly this.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the latter item, my point was to say that advancing material and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing science WILL inevitably lower the threshold for building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines complex, capable and reliable enough to get  to orbit.
</em><br>
Ultimately,
<br>
<em>&gt; it will get cheap and easy enough that relatively small groups with modest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; financing CAN do it with reasonable business models.  Where the two lines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cross is anybody's guess at this point, but it's probably somewhere short
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; full-blown Drextech.  (For example, consider the debacle with the fuel
</em><br>
tank
<br>
<em>&gt; on the Venture Star - or whatever they're calling it now - relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straightforward advances in composite materials technology will make a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference.)
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this, but I'd rather not bank on it.  I think we can have a
<br>
successful rocket company now.  To paraphrase Adrian, &quot;Go business plan!&quot;
<br>
<p>Unless I'm very misinformed, all of these small private launch companies
<br>
from the 1980s and 1990s tried (or are trying) to make unique, new launch
<br>
vehicles.  Not so much unique in propulsion methods, but just not off the
<br>
shelf.
<br>
<p>For instance, though I wish Roton all the best and hope their idea works and
<br>
eventually gets to market, when I first saw it, I laughed.  I thought, if
<br>
you want a recipe for failure, this is it.  A manned launch vehicle that
<br>
relies on a propeller to land.  I was happily surprised when they did their
<br>
test flights.  I like being wrong when I'm pessimistic or cynical, but I
<br>
still think the idea is a bit too complicated to put into practice right now
<br>
or even in the near future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, as I think about what kind of intermediate steps might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make sense, I wonder whether they can represent meaningful economic way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stations on the path to a truly revolutionary approach to the business of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting into space.  The most obvious intermediate step seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propulsion which, as far as I can tell from what's publicly available from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; XCOR's web site, seems to be the approach it is taking.  But aren't there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already plenty of rocket engine manufacturers, especially with the
</em><br>
Russians
<br>
<em>&gt; now in the global market?  Unless you've developed some significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvements in manufacturing and/or operating efficiencies, have you
</em><br>
really
<br>
<em>&gt; gotten any closer to building a truly new avenue to orbit?
</em><br>
<p>Why a new one?  Why not take old, working engines whose patents have expired
<br>
and just mass produce them?
<br>
<p>The other types of support and non-launch space services and stuff you
<br>
mention from SpaceDev are great examples of other ways to get a space
<br>
company to IPO and to get funding for developing launch services.
<br>
<p>Happy New Year!
