<p>What about the impact of diet? Does not a better childhood diet (as well as a
<br>
decrease in childhood diseases) impact resultant IQs? Then again, you also have
<br>
the fact that the increase in women with higher education brings the
<br>
intelligence of the female into play when mating qualifications are examined.
<br>
Prior to highly educated women, there was no standard for comparison for men to
<br>
tell the intelligence of one woman from another without more extensive courting
<br>
experience. As a result, possibly more intelligent people marry each other now
<br>
than in the past...
