</em><br>
<em>&gt;  are talking about a roughly -11,500 lb penalty just to get to a minimal
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Aha - I should have thought of that.  I knew about the &quot;fact sheets&quot; on each 
<br>
of the orbiters&quot;.  Looking these over and the payload weights recorded for 
<br>
ISS flights, it looks like your SWAG of 5-6 tons is about right for the &quot;Cold 
<br>
War Orbit Penalty&quot;.  Well, that's one way to quantify the &quot;weight of history&quot; 
<br>
I'm always blathering on about.

<p><em>&gt;   &gt; &lt;&gt;  Would it be possible to actually use the ISS as a &quot;construction 
</em><br>
base&quot; 
<br>
<em>&gt; for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; projects such as assembling translunar or interplanetary vehicles?  
</em><br>
This 
<br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The trend goes to smaller system size. It is not obvious why even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  deep space mission would profit from more bulk, unless we're talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  manned missions. But manned missions are an obvious mistake at this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  point, anyway.
</em><br>
<p>Gene, gene, I KNOW that, I just don't FEEL that :-)  And politics and 
<br>
historical inertia being what they are, a good deal of homo sapiens' 
<br>
investment in extraterrestrial infrastructure over the next 10-15 years is 
<br>
going to be in NASA/ /Energia/ESA/NASDA's manned programs, like it or not.  
<br>
Furthermore, as Spike has pointed out here recently, a significant portion of 
<br>
humanity's collective knowledge of space science and technology is 
<br>
concentrated in the institutions that run these programs.  One of the primary 
<br>
values of the ISS program I see for the intermediate term is that it provides 
<br>
a place for this group of people to continue to practice and perfect their 
<br>
craft for the next decade or so.
<br>
<p>Beyond that, I'll reply to your specific point above: One reason for bulk is 
<br>
REDUNDANCY, a very high value in space tech.  This IS a relative value, 
<br>
however: The smaller the components in a spacecraft, the lower the gross 
<br>
penalty one pays for redundancy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; &lt;&gt; Suppose someone actually uses the ISS for one of the primary original 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; purposes envisioned in the Original Plan, i.e. as a construction and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; maintenance base for further space infrastructure, such as a reusable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; translunar vehicle, planetary transit vehicles and the like.  How much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; penalty is imposed by its current orbit?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Excuse me, I don't see any logics behind this. All the mass must come
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  from the bottom of some nearby gravitational well. There is nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  else there nearby which doesn't have a prohibitive delta vee. 
</em><br>
<p>There is one value in marshalling resources in one place: Logistics 
<br>
efficiency, which is why I don't like the high inclination orbit ISS is in.  
<br>
Matching a fuel packet to a user on a case-by case basis requires optimizing 
<br>
lift investment to each specific mission.  In any given case, a specific 
<br>
booster may have more delta-v capacity than a specific refueling or other 
<br>
supply task requires.  Averaging over a large number of refuelings, it may be 
<br>
more efficient to optimize fuel lift out of Earth's gravity well and pay a 
<br>
smaller total penalty on each rendezvous in Earth orbit.  Remember, LEO is 
<br>
half-way to anywhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  thinks about braking down some near earth asteroids with a barrage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  nukes sufficient for Earth orbit capture, lowering down asteroid belt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  material with solar sails or braking a comet fragment using newly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  proposed plasma magnetic solar wind sail these are obviously highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  complex, very expensive missions. Being realistic, we cannot think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  those yet.
</em><br>
<p>That's right, which is where my questions come from.  You may recall I asked 
<br>
the questions some many months ago &quot;(1) given Drextech, how fast could a 
<br>
committed group of space enthusiasts develop a basic space infrastructure and 
<br>
(2) how small a group of technologists would be required to cover all the 
<br>
bases to create a basic extraterrestrial infrastructure?&quot;  Bearing in mind 
<br>
Robin's observations about &quot;dreams of autarchy&quot;, the reality of nano-enabled 
<br>
space efforts will almost surely not be that of a small group starting ab 
<br>
initio, but rather will consist of incremental work building on whatever 
<br>
exists at the time and, at first at least, in a fashion that is embedded in 
<br>
the existing institutional and programmatic dynamics of the time.  This is 
<br>
one of the primary reasons I continue to be keenly interested in the most 
<br>
likely state of space infrastructure development over the next 10-40 years.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  If you want to refuel using Earth resources, you need to haul up fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  using some cheap transportation, hypersonic reusable vehicle (to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  developed, a risky investment) or old-fashioned rockets (proven,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  scalable technology, would be much cheaper if built in numbers). It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  would be much better to use lunar linear mass drivers for launching
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  processed materials and probes, so constructing these should be on top
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of our priorities.
</em><br>
<p>I'm with you 100% on this, gene, which is why I have to grit my teeth at the 
<br>
activities of the Mars crowd.  Luna is FAR more important for the near-term 
<br>
development of space. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  We can get to the Moon in one piece from Earth surface. Why using
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  several missions to bring up fuel and system modules before going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the Moon? It would rather make more sense to build a bigger rocket,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  something which can carry twice Proton's payload.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, true . . . but how likely are we to get a good Saturn-class booster in 
<br>
the near future? The near-to-intermediate-term economics of space development 
<br>
support continued refinement of small and intermediate sized boosters.  This 
<br>
factor alone is one reason that an on-orbit construction facility may be 
<br>
important.  And the process of building ISS shows that - again in the 
<br>
near-to-intermediate term - having a monkey on site to hook things up IS 
<br>
still a good value.  Until we have highly reliable, lightweight robots with 
<br>
equal dexterity and flexibility, folks who live in my town are going to be 
<br>
needed to build things in space. (Did I just show a bias???)
