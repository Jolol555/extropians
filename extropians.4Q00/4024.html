<p>The thought police have been active on US campuses for decades. Nothing new
<br>
there. Thought police are often referred to as &quot;politically correct&quot; in the
<br>
popular press. The Left apparently approves of criminalizing thought more
<br>
than does the Right. I find this interesting since the Left tries to pass
<br>
itself off as &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;progressive.&quot; I guess that means they want a
<br>
liberal amount of thought crime suppression and more progress toward a
<br>
police state.

<p>&quot;If you go back a hundred years,&quot; he explains, &quot;one of the biggest
<br>
scientific questions was 'what is life?' And one of the most prominent
<br>
theories had to do with vitalism--some substance, some thing that is
<br>
transmitted from cell to cell, animal to animal, that is the essence of
<br>
life. Well, you don't hear anybody talking about vitalism anymore. We've
<br>
come far enough to see all the mechanics--we've seen how DNA works, we've
<br>
seen all the pieces of the cell, and we don't have need for a hypothesis
<br>
like vitalism.&quot; So it will go, Sejnowski suspects, with consciousness.
<br>
(Phlogiston, incidentally, refers to a theoretical substance that people
<br>
once sought in combustible material, thinking it made up the &quot;substance&quot; of
<br>
fire.)
