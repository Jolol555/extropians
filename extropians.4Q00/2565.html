<p>
I'm very glad to have heard Samantha and Anders feedback to my question
<br>
about mysticism, intuition and emotion.  From the Web materials that I have
<br>
read about Extropianism, it does often seem that rationality and engineering
<br>
solutions are often overemphasized.  But after participating in this
<br>
discussion, it seems that there is a more well-rounded concept.
<br>
<p>I think that Extropianism would better present itself by elaborating in more
<br>
detail the need for advanced psychological integration.  I think that the
<br>
technological advancements will enable a better chance for the average
<br>
speciman of a new species to be able to self-actualize.  But unless the
<br>
psychological concerns are given equal weight to the technological concerns,
<br>
post-humanity could end up a nastier, more powerful version of ourselves.
<br>
<p>In thinking about psychology, has anyone here read the work of Ken Wilber?
<br>
I have derived much understanding form his integral approach to psychology.
<br>
I would be very interested in hearing some Extropian views about his work.
<br>
<p>BTW:  I'm on the digest list, so I may always be a little behind in my
<br>
responses or have missed subsequent posts that may be relevant.
