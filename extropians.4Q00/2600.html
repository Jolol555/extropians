<em>&gt; I think this is so far perhaps the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convincing practical step towards exploring what it would be like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be posthuman. The technology is clunky, but it is a forerunner in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same way Douglas Englebart's demonstration of a primitive mouse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interface, cut-and-paste, hypertext and computer network in the 60's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a forerunner of today's interfaces and networks. 
</em><br>
<p>I agree, this is a fascinating concept and one which I would like to
<br>
explore as the technology becomes cheaper.  The article mentioned Doug
<br>
Platt, an Extropian who was active in this area.  Several years ago at
<br>
a party at Max's house I met Doug (I think it was Doug) who demonstrated
<br>
his wearable equipment, a PC with a chord keyboard he could wear on his
<br>
belt, and a head-mounted display (HMD).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, the big question is whetehr wearables will be the way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go, or if PDAs will out-compete them. In the same way, good wearables
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may block development of direct brain-computer interfaces beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medical use.
</em><br>
<p>With the Palm VII and WAP enabled Internet phones, wearables may
<br>
seem obsolete, but the display bandwidth provided by these devices is
<br>
so limited that it restricts their usefulness.  A wireless internet
<br>
connection feeding a HMD would be far more useful.
<br>
<p>Then the whole idea of mediated reality is fascinating even without
<br>
wireless technolgy.  Some of Mann's claims seem exaggerated to me;
<br>
I don't see how you could remove ads with current technology, other
<br>
than putting a manually-controlled opaque window into the display.
<br>
However they give us a feel for the kinds of things that will be possible.
<br>
<p>Mann's ideas about exploring other sensory modalities are fascinating
<br>
as well.  He uses sonar sensors with vibrating tactile stimulators to give
<br>
a &quot;feel&quot; for what is around and behind you.  I saw an article yesterday
<br>
about using smells to provide information.  While your portfolio is going
<br>
up you smell honeysuckle; when it drops there is an odor of burnt toast.
<br>
This would be processed unconsciously so you'd always be aware of your
<br>
financial status in the back of your mind.
<br>
<p>Lots of cool stuff around the corner!
<br>
<p>Hal
