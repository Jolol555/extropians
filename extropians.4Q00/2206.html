<p>
Is marriage extropic?
<br>
Or is love extropic?
<br>
<p>Imaging the Neural Correlate of Romantic Love.
<br>
S. Zeki and A. Bartels , University College London, UK.
<br>
<p>We have, for the first time, localised the areas of the human brain involved
<br>
in evoking one of the most overwhelming of all affective states, that of
<br>
romantic love. The activity in the brains of 17 subjects (11 female, all
<br>
gave written consent) who were 'truly and madly' in love was scanned using
<br>
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while they viewed pictures of
<br>
their loved partners and compared to the brain activity evoked when they
<br>
viewed pictures of three friends of similar age, sex and duration of
<br>
friendship. A statistical analysis was performed using SPM99. The activity
<br>
was restricted to bilateral foci in the medial insula and the anterior
<br>
cingulate cortex, and, subcortically, in the caudate nucleus and the
<br>
putamen. Deactivations were observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus and in
<br>
the amygdala and were right-lateralized in the prefrontal, parietal and
<br>
middle temporal cortices. An independent component analysis (ICA) isolated
<br>
these regions in most subjects in components that contained no other
<br>
activity. Our results thus show that the visual stimuli which evoke romantic
<br>
love result in a particular pattern of differential brain activity involving
<br>
a restricted number of sites. Though these sites may overlap partially with
<br>
sites evoked in studies involving other affective states such as anger, fear
<br>
and sadness, and even happiness and sexual arousal, the pattern observed
<br>
here is nevertheless unique and different from that observed with other
<br>
affective states. These differences lead us to postulate that the principle
<br>
of functional specialisation in the cortex applies as well to affective
<br>
states.
