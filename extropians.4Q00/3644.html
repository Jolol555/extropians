<p>
I think one of the key problems with the copy question is semantics 
<br>
and goals.  Although I can agree with every scientific claim or 
<br>
measurement theorized for the copy, it does not help me achieve what 
<br>
I mean by immortality.
<br>
<p>I don't want my personal consciousness to be destroyed.  The concept 
<br>
of &quot;my&quot; consciousness is an ownership claim.  I can't prove with 
<br>
science that I own my own consciousness.  It is just a feeling of 
<br>
attachment I have.
<br>
<p>If an exact copy of me were made, I would feel like there were two 
<br>
identical copies of me.  I would still perceive sensations coming 
<br>
from my original body.  The copy would only perceive sensations 
<br>
coming from its body.  Even if we were identical and 
<br>
indistinguishable, I would still be attached to my original body and 
<br>
not the new one.  If the new body were destroyed, I would feel like I 
<br>
were alive and that another had died.  If the old body were 
<br>
destroyed, I would feel myself losing consciousness, know I were 
<br>
dying, and never think again.
<br>
<p>Although the functional utility of these two people are identical to 
<br>
the external world, they are dramatically different to me.  I still 
<br>
lose my consciousness when my original body is destroyed.  The new 
<br>
body does not help my original consciousness survive.  Even if a new 
<br>
consciousness lives on, it is like my offspring.  It is not 
<br>
personally me.  Even if it is another &quot;me&quot;, I still would keep 
<br>
searching for a way to make my original consciousness immortal.
<br>
<p>I don't see how making a copy helps my quest in any way.  Even if the 
<br>
rest of the world cannot tell the difference, I can easily.  The 
<br>
hypothetical claims that feeding the copy my exact sensory input and 
<br>
keeping the minds in synch do not help here.  The goal is to move me 
<br>
to another body so that I can diverge and avoid the death of the 
<br>
original body.  Although the copy question is always entertaining, I 
<br>
am not sure what its usefulness is.  Creating a new &quot;me&quot; is only half 
<br>
the question.  How do we handle the old &quot;me&quot;?  Killing it or letting 
<br>
it die is not a solution.  That &quot;solution&quot; is the exact event I am 
<br>
trying to prevent!
