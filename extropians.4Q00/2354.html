such things.

<p>I've been heavily influenced in such matters by Robert Heinleins
<br>
&quot;Starship Troopers&quot;. I guess the question I'm asking is &quot;at what
<br>
price citizenship&quot;. It pains me that people who have never lifted
<br>
their little finger to actually do anything for this country, or
<br>
bothered to study the issues actually get to vote. I'm not
<br>
suggesting they have their votes taken away, but it's nice to see
<br>
them earn it, even if it only means going out in the rain.
<br>
<p>Heinlein answered it in Starship troopers by only having Veterans
<br>
vote.

<p><p><em>&gt;In reality, all sort of outcomes could follow. The bored or

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Oz, where voting is compulsory and failure to turn out (even in
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Something to think about. The sad part is that I really do think
<br>
the lottery bit would dramatically increase turnout.
