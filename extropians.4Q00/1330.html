<em>&gt;  Spike Jones writes:&gt; tall, handsome young Captain America type to Mars...

</em><br>
<p>Ja, but the commies seem to be losing interest in the project.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; to plant a damn striped piece of cloth and come home, I suppose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why on Earth Mars? You still need zero-volume delta joint vacuum suits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, because you still see 98% of the same force as in Earth orbit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Moon surface.
</em><br>
<p>I think we can do em both, more or less simultaneously, and use
<br>
a lot of shared technologies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Water? There's water on the Moon (unless the neutron
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data from Lunar prospector is totally bogus which I don't believe),
</em><br>
<p>Roger that.  I suspect at the end of the day, carbon and phosphorus
<br>
will be the show stoppers for lunar colonization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oxygen? Darn Moon is made from some few 10% of that stuff,
</em><br>
<p>No argument there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't do vacuum industrial processes on Mars, because the atmosphere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in the way, and insolation density is a bit thin out there.
</em><br>
<p>One of the favorite sayings from the Mars group goes like this:
<br>
Mars, just like the moon, only with bad weather.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; the point of that?  The first Martians need to stay and work, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; just explore and poke flags into the red soil.  We can build machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; that can explore.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed. But why should people stay and work on Mars and not on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moon?
</em><br>
<p>Again, little argument.  I would think we could do both.  Im not
<br>
satisfied with the notion of doing Earth orbit for 40 years, then do
<br>
a moon colony for the next 40, then a Mars colony, etc.  With the
<br>
proper *scaling* of the mission (thats where I get these crazy notions
<br>
of a crew of one) these can be effectively done simultaneously,
<br>
without draining the national treasury.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I admit that it is an outrageously high-risk venture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is rather a very expensive suicide mission.
</em><br>
<p>Oh ye of Leitl faith.  Get the right people behind this mission
<br>
and it has a better than even chance of success.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Honestly, which disabilities would give you an advantage?
</em><br>
<p>The ones that pre adapt one for the loneliness and boredom
<br>
of being the only person on a faraway planet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that weighing just 25 kg can give you advantage for long spaceflights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without a closed-circuit ecology -- if you can survive the launch and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reentry -- but what else?
</em><br>
<p>The differently abled condition I have in mind demonstrates the
<br>
victim's ability to live indoors indefinitely.  You and I would go
<br>
crazy with that arrangement, since we have had the blessings
<br>
of health and fitness.  If I recall correctly from our last meeting,
<br>
Gene, you are an athletic young man.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Microgravity could be the next great equalizer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Right-o!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you seen what happens to people and animals after one year of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microgravity?
</em><br>
<p>Evidently much of the calcium dumped from the body comes from
<br>
the large leg bones.  Wouldnt be problem for the case I have in mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Higher organisms are not made for space.
</em><br>
<p>That depends on how one defines &quot;higher.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated gravity thus negating all advantages disabled people might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly have.
</em><br>
<p>Simulated gravity is great to have, but there are some compelling
<br>
reasons to not use it, having to do with increased complication
<br>
of the spacecraft.  Even if one uses a tethered countermass, sim
<br>
gravity greatly reduces the amount of useable space available in
<br>
the hab module.  Of course one could argue that the space will no
<br>
longer be useable upon arrival, I suppose.
<br>
<p>Most of the advantage in using a differently abled person as the
<br>
first Martian would be psychological: their lives on Mars might
<br>
even be an improvement in some ways over life here.  I doubt
<br>
that would be the case with any of us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, space is rather unforgiving. The less reason to go galumphing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about in a space suit, and use teleoperated machinery instead.
</em><br>
<p>So why not both?  The role of the human on Mars is more
<br>
critical than a human on the moon.  Since the moon is only
<br>
a little over a light second away, we could teleoperate machinery
<br>
on the moon more easily than we could operate the same
<br>
machinery on Mars.  Forget the space suits in both cases:
<br>
build a moon base with machines controlled from Earth, build
<br>
a Mars base with machines controlled by a Martian who
<br>
stays inside the lander/hab module.  spike
