PART 2
<br>
<p><p>Nine Tough Questions You Haven't Asked Me Yet:
<br>
<p>1. &quot;Is it logical to cling to a particular iteration?&quot;
<br>
<p>For some, perhaps not.  I've got a bit of solipsism mixed into my philosophy
<br>
however, so in my case, it's the difference that makes all the difference.
<br>
I have a bit of an experiential bias towards reality.  I confess: I don't
<br>
really care about (or even, perhaps, believe in) external realities that
<br>
don't share a causal experiential chain with me.
<br>
<p><p>2. &quot;We build a form of uploading in which it can be definitively shown that
<br>
iterative destruction results.  Do you go for it anyway?&quot;
<br>
<p>No, damn it.  But I won't be happy about it.  (Sigh... at least it will be
<br>
'me' not being happy about it, as opposed to Jason #2 having the time of his
<br>
life.)
<br>
<p><p>3. &quot; Transporter beams?&quot;
<br>
<p>Nope, sorry.
<br>
<p><p>4. &quot;Don't you want to be like Captain Kirk, and see the universe and make
<br>
out with green chicks on strange planets?&quot;
<br>
<p>Doesn't everybody?
<br>
<p><p>5. &quot;Yer just being difficult, aren't you?&quot;
<br>
<p>I would never never never do that.  Never.  How dare you suggest such a
<br>
thing?  I'm shocked.
<br>
<p><p>6. &quot;Come, come, elucidate your thoughts.&quot;
<br>
<p>Watch it.
<br>
<p><p>7. &quot;If you do upload, don't you want to make back-up copies of yourself?&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes I do.  But it's not going to be as simple as having the contents of my
<br>
hard drive on a DVD somewhere.  I imagine an uploaded system with lots of
<br>
redundancies, capable of recovering from widespread damage on the fly with
<br>
nearly instantaneously mirrored processes and data.  However, there would be
<br>
an amount of damage that would be unacceptable-- a point at which the
<br>
intelligence &quot;goes away.&quot;  That would be a bad thing.
<br>
<p><p>8.  &quot;Can't you see all the ways in which this is a limiting belief?&quot;
<br>
<p>Functionally, I appreciate the problem.  But, again, can't -you- see why
<br>
it's the difference that makes all the difference?  This belief doesn't
<br>
limit myself, it limits the prospects of the next iteration (which, I admit,
<br>
might not be a very nice thing to do.  I apologize in advance for any harm I
<br>
may be inflicting on my future iterations-- but if you guys just hold out
<br>
long enough, I might change my mind!)
<br>
<p><p>9.  &quot;Are you done yet?&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, goodbye.
