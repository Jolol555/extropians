<em>&gt; A few possibly clarifying points:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. As Robin points out above, we factor out uncertainty, growth etc. and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focus on the remaining tendency that people have to discount the future.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think you can separate out discounting so easily from these
<br>
other effects.  An analogy I might suggest is our taste for foods.
<br>
In some sense this is ideosyncratic and comes from within.  However it is
<br>
determined in large part by our evolutionary heritage.  We like foods that
<br>
are sweet and fatty because they were good energy sources in an era when
<br>
starvation was a threat.  We don't sit down and analyze a food rationally
<br>
to determine whether it tastes good, so it may appear that whether a
<br>
food tastes good or not has nothing to do with how healthy it is.
<br>
<p>In the same way, discounting may still appear even in experiments where
<br>
growth and risk of loss have been eliminated.  But that doesn't mean that
<br>
it is independent of those effects, any more than the fact that unhealthy
<br>
foods taste good means that tastes have nothing to do with the health
<br>
value of foods.  Rather, in each case I would suggest that evolution built
<br>
into us an instinct which serves us well in the majority of situations we
<br>
encountered at the time.  We like sugar and we discount the future for the
<br>
same reason, because it was a good strategy for our ancestors to follow.
<br>
Put us in a situation where sugar is unhealthy and we'll still like it.
<br>
Put us in a situation where there is no risk in postponing consumption,
<br>
and we'll still want to consume the majority today.  It's not because
<br>
discounting has nothing to do with risk, it's that discounting is an
<br>
instinctive behavior that works well in a risky world.
<br>
<p>It also appears to me that the authors have not tried to separate
<br>
discounting from issues of uncertainty about the future, as when they
<br>
write,
<br>
<p>: Beyond revealed preference, the strongest theoretical argument in
<br>
: favor of discounting, involves what Bohm-Bawerk referred to as the
<br>
: &quot;brevity and uncertainty of human life.&quot;  According to this view,
<br>
: people discount future felicity because they may not be around to
<br>
: enjoy it.  An individual weighs pleasures at date t by the conditional
<br>
: probability of living until date t.
<br>
<p>Rather than factoring out uncertainty, they propose uncertainty as a
<br>
theoretical justification for discounting.  I suggested earlier that
<br>
in addition to the possibility of death, there are other forms of
<br>
&quot;uncertainty of human life&quot;.  Given that life is uncertain, it seems
<br>
very plausible to me that evolution would program discounting into
<br>
living creatures.
<br>
<p>Put another way, I suggest that if we could somehow imagine creatures
<br>
evolving in a situation where there was no uncertainty, and goods saved
<br>
would be guaranteed to be available in the future, those creatures would
<br>
not discount the future.  They would have no incentive to consume more in
<br>
the present.  Rather, they would take a long term perspective and allocate
<br>
their goods equally across each period of their life.  Of course this
<br>
is purely hypothetical but it will hopefully make my position more plain.
<br>
<p>We see discounting today as a psychological effect, but the fact remains
<br>
that it must be there for a reason.  The question is, then, is discounting
<br>
rational, and are discount rates optimal under at least some conditions.
<br>
In other words, is discounting purely endogenous as the authors seem
<br>
to assume, a matter of taste only, or is it exogenous, determined by
<br>
outside conditions and external constraints?
<br>
<p>If the latter, proposals to artificially change discount rates must
<br>
cause inefficiencies and impose costs.  I don't see that the paper's
<br>
analysis considers this possibility.  Social planners do not have the
<br>
freedom to shift discount rates around at will in order to benefit one
<br>
time frame over another, any more than they can shift prices at will in
<br>
order to benefit one group or another.  Making these changes will have
<br>
consequences for the welfare and efficiency of the society as a whole.
<br>
Any proposal to take such actions must look at the larger picture.
<br>
