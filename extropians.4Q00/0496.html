As a follow-up to my earlier comments on this quantum collapse
<br>
controversy, I just thought I'd mention that some of Amara Graps'
<br>
earlier info (on advanced probability treatments of this matter) would
<br>
seem to be getting through to me. Certainly, I'm interested enough in
<br>
what modern physics has to say about the nature of reality to want to
<br>
have a reasonably definitive answer on this, and not just simply be
<br>
unsure about the real status of the most basic objects in physics.  
<br>
<p>Earlier, I wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, all the properties of quantum waves could be coming from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematically neat, expanded definition of what it means for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particle's position to be uncertain? Follow Jayne's suggestion, consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a higher phase space perhaps, and our own uncertainty about location in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that space could produce interference effects, qubit computers, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything else predicted by the standard quantum math?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; . . .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One area where I continue to doubt this &quot;non-local vector&quot; idea is when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I consider that an entire, difficult-to-foresee chain of consequences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can sometimes block the &quot;travel&quot; of these quantum waves or vectors. I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read this in some of the ideas relating to interaction-free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurements, where it is said that quantum measurements could even very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often tell if a &quot;bomb&quot; is live, as opposed to possibly being a dud!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [. . . then, a whole lot more about the unusual logic of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, I still don't know the right answer to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question of quantum alternate worlds, given that &quot;might have beens&quot; can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparently have a direct causal effect on real measurements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK, without necessarily trying to have *all* the answers, I'd say that
<br>
something reasonable is starting to filter through into my thoughts on
<br>
this, something saying that, while Many Worlds may have some interesting
<br>
points as a model for quantum theory, it probably *isn't* literally
<br>
true. For instance, looking at my comment about a &quot;might have been&quot;
<br>
explosion blocking a quantum path, it certainly seems possible that a
<br>
sufficiently complicated mathematical space could encompass such an
<br>
explosion in such a way as to exclude a passing photon from ever getting
<br>
through that &quot;might have been&quot; scenario. So we're thinking about a state
<br>
space that somehow &quot;contains&quot; a lot of such possibilities in a
<br>
consistent way -- but that provides no necessity for thinking that the
<br>
whole ensemble of chances are all really happening.
<br>
<p>If we were to think of this &quot;ultimate&quot; state space as encompassing all
<br>
the possible positions and motions of all particles, then maybe it
<br>
wouldn't be going too far to think of the actual universe as just a kind
<br>
of single particle, occupying some position in that vast state space? If
<br>
this is a reasonable picture, there remains a question as to whether the
<br>
resulting world history takes a deterministic path, or, alternatively,
<br>
whether our universe-history has some sort of ultimate randomness in its
<br>
development. There are some standard ideas about quantum theory that
<br>
would seem to indicate a degree of ultimate randomness. At the same
<br>
time, however, if the real truth about probability is that observers are
<br>
simply uncertain about our positioning in state space, then maybe there
<br>
is some way that an &quot;ultimate&quot; knowledge could be said to determine the
<br>
real position of every particle, as well as the future history of the
<br>
universe as a whole?
<br>
<p>Mysteries of determinism aside, I'll concede that the simplest
<br>
assumption about alternate histories is that we've just got *one*
<br>
history wandering through some vast ensemble of possibilities. In this
<br>
scheme of things, quantum effects (such as a little bomb threatening to
<br>
decohere a photon path), work just the way they do, because of the
<br>
interesting structure of the overall state space, or &quot;backdrop&quot;. So, I'm
<br>
beginning to understand what some physicists, like Seth Lloyd, have been
<br>
talking about, when they admit to a vast backdrop of &quot;Many Worlds like&quot;
<br>
possibilities, but with the individual chances to be regarded as only
<br>
&quot;potentially&quot; real. All probability analysis is like that in some sense
<br>
-- for instance, all positions in ordinary 3D space are potentially real
<br>
places for a particle to go. As a matter of making a simplest
<br>
assumption, then, maybe we've got a Grand Comprehensive State Space that
<br>
is actually real, plus a combined position for all the particles in the
<br>
whole material universe. To assume that any *other* universes are
<br>
following their own histories through that state space, would just mess
<br>
things up, presumably. Meanwhile, state vectors and quantum waves are
<br>
just ways of expressing our basic uncertainty about where things really
<br>
are at any given time -- the state vector and waves never need to
<br>
&quot;collapse&quot; if they were never locally &quot;there&quot; to begin with.
<br>
<p>Again, thanks to my fellow email posters for the help on this. For now,
<br>
I'm thinking that the background space or backdrop for the universe is
<br>
just more complicated than intuition would suggest, and that this is the
<br>
key to all the most counterintuitive quantum experiments. As a general
<br>
answer to the &quot;wave collapse&quot; question, this seems pretty good, pretty
<br>
general in nature, and, I'd certainly guess that future developments
<br>
won't mess this up this particular insight! With understanding of
<br>
quantum matters increasing, maybe we'll even eventually have household
<br>
gadgets based on this stuff -- I mean, quantum encipherment, qubit
<br>
desktop computers, who knows what the strange logic of Q-space may
<br>
bring?
