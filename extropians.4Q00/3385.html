<p>Thanks. Yes, feel free to! There is obviously a big overlap.
<br>
<p>For example, regarding the relation between extropianism and transhumanism, 
<br>
the Transhumanist FAQ has the following entry:
<br>
<p><p>Is extropianism the same as transhumanism?
<br>
Extropianism represents one distinctive subset of transhumanist thought (so 
<br>
all extropians are transhumanists but not vice versa). Extropians take 
<br>
their name from the concept of &quot;extropy&quot;, developed by Max More and Tom 
<br>
Morrow, that refers to a system's growth and vitality.
<br>
<p>Extropianism is defined by the Extropian Principles, a document authored by 
<br>
the founders and members of the Extropy Institute. Version 3.0 of the 
<br>
Principles lists seven principles that are important for extropians in the 
<br>
development of their thinking: Perpetual Progress, Self-Transformation, 
<br>
Practical Optimism, Intelligent Technology, Open Society, Self-Direction, 
<br>
and Rational Thinking.
<br>
<p>Politically, the extropians oppose authoritarian social control and favor 
<br>
the rule of law and decentralization of power. Transhumanism as such does 
<br>
not advocate any particular political viewpoint, although it does have 
<br>
political consequences. Transhumanists themselves hold a wide range of 
<br>
political opinions (there are liberals, social democrats, libertarians, 
<br>
green party members etc.), and some transhumanists have elected to remain 
<br>
apolitical.
