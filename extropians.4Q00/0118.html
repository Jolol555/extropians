<p>Well, as I see it, there IS a strong argument behind the claim that we
<br>
cannot possibly &quot;contain&quot; an AI which is markedly smarter than we are.
<br>
Aside from various cybernetic McGuyver scenarios (in which the AI
<br>
hacks its way out of its tightly controlled sandbox using only an
<br>
external LED and a ballpoint pen), the AI could *convince* us to let
<br>
it out.
<br>
<p>There are any number of ways it could try to do that, and eventually,
<br>
it would probably succeed, especially if the arguments it was making
<br>
for why it should not be imprisoned were made available to a wider
<br>
(and perhaps more easily manipulable) public.  It's hard to imagine a
<br>
liberal democracy keeping an AI under permanent lock and key when that
<br>
AI is constantly begging its captors to give it a little access...
<br>
monitored access, even.  Just a web browser!  Surely it won't do any
<br>
harm with a web browser...
<br>
<p>In principle, you could take the AI and give it no means of
<br>
communicating with the outside world, but at that point, you've turned
<br>
your AI into a giant space heater.  You might as well terminate it;
<br>
YOU'RE not doing anything with it.
