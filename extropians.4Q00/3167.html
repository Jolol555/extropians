Greg Burch forwards:
<br>
<em>&gt; From The Times of India,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.timesofindia.com/171100/17hlth14.htm">http://www.timesofindia.com/171100/17hlth14.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A poll of 1,015 Americans reveals that although most feel it is okay for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents to choose to have a child who can ``give cells&quot; to a sick sibling,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they largely oppose allowing parents to choose to have an attractive or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gifted child. Most also feel parents should not choose whether to have a boy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or girl.
</em><br>
<p>It bothers me that these issues are so often couched in terms of what we
<br>
should let other people do.  While I recognize that this is the question
<br>
we must ask for public policy, there is more to life than public policy.
<br>
<p>Before deciding what we would allow others to do, shouldn't we decide
<br>
for ourselves what we will do?
<br>
<p>I'd rather see a survey asking people if they would (hypothetically) choose
<br>
an attractive or gifted child, or choose between a boy and a girl.
<br>
<p>Now, it may be that the answers to these questions would be the same as
<br>
asking what should be permitted.  In that case people are simply trying
<br>
to legislate their own taste in the matter.  But I would hope that people
<br>
can recognize that there is a gray area between the personal choices
<br>
they make, and the range of choices others should be permitted to make.
<br>
<p>Ask the question openly: &quot;Do you think other people should be allowed to
<br>
do only those things that you would choose to do?&quot;  Then ask, for each
<br>
of these controversial uses of technology, &quot;Would you choose to do this?&quot;
<br>
and &quot;Would you allow others to choose to do this?&quot;  Wording the questions
<br>
like this would get people thinking about whether they are so sure of
<br>
their own choices in these complex issues that they would force others
<br>
to follow them.
