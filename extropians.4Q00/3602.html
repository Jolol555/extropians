To michael.bast:
<br>
<p>Fair enough.  I didn't think you were particularly flaming me even when
<br>
you did say something about my comments being fuel for illustrating
<br>
exactly what you have trouble/disagreements with.  :-)   And yes, I am
<br>
reading you.  Obviously.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Hmm. So you are all for actual major government nastiness if the money extorted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or whatever goes to fund what you care &gt;most about?  How far does that go?  Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you willing to see people robbed, beaten, even killed to fund this stuff?  Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &gt;ends utterly justify the means in your mind?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are personally defining someone's rights (or accepting someone else's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitions) and then holding people to them. What about all those people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree with your ideas of rights, their sources and derivations, your logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure? If you want to be allowed to make your own mind up, why deny someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else the same? 
</em><br>
<p><p>Simple.  They want to not only make their own mind up but having decided
<br>
that X is good they would like to force my compliance at gunpoint.  I
<br>
have no intention of forcing them to do anything at all.  If we have no
<br>
logic in common then I guess little more than self-defense of one's
<br>
person and space or avoidance of one another would be left.  
<br>
<p>Specifically above I am responding to a point you made about (as I
<br>
understood it) having little problems with government funded meddling in
<br>
many things as long as the meddling was in the direction you wanted it
<br>
to go.  I attempted to point out that is a very slippery slope and asked
<br>
how you would establish boundaries to such.  I also tried to point out
<br>
what I believe are reasonable answers (or approximations along the way)
<br>
to some of your doubts.  I don't see how any of that constitutes not
<br>
reading what you say or responding to it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; By defining the terms of the debate (what a right is, how logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works, etc.) you really stop any debate. Yes, there have to be rules or chaos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results. But, you're (in effect) saying thousands of years of mainstream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy, theology (natural rights are derived from religion, despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertions otherwise), etc. I might agree, but, again, I'm used to being in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minority position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If we have no logic, no means of reasoning, then we have no means of
<br>
describing and examining ideas critically and thus no means of &quot;debate&quot;.
<br>
Humans have believe all kinds of bizarre and wrong-headed things for
<br>
thousands of years.  So what?  
<br>
<p>Natural rights cannot be derived from supposed divine fiat and still be
<br>
&quot;natural&quot;.  You speak in open contradictions.  Ah, I forgot, there I go
<br>
again, using logic.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;No.  I am not forcing anyone to do anything  but leave me alone.  All  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ask for is a negative, the absence of  coercion.  If you want to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;really twisted I guess you can say I am denying someone's right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;murder, plunder and enslave me.  But to say that would assume there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;such a thing as some right to do these things.  I don't care what people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;agree with. I care whether or not they live with me and one another in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;remotely civilized manner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; THIS may be the clearest example yet of what I mean. YOU are deciding how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debate goes, on what terms, what has relevance, etc. That is just not how it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes. There are a whole lot of people whose emotions are part of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning, and you do have to deal with those people. Like sucks that way, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's reality.
</em><br>
<p>Fine.  There is nothing in their being bound by emotions that says I
<br>
have to be bound to whatever treatment their emotions tell them to
<br>
bestow upon me, is there?  I think you really need to say what you
<br>
believe is required to have a reasonably peaceful and productive
<br>
society. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Your emotions are irrelevant.  Give me your reasoning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On this, I agree completely. However, what you don't seem to get is my point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it. We won't ever get to minimalist government the way we're going. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't convince enough people to do so, and on this we DO need a majority. That's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just the way it works.
</em><br>
<p>Was the American Revolution started or sustained by a simple majority? 
<br>
I don't think so.  Perhaps freedom happens when enough people care
<br>
enough about it to fight hard enough for it that it is more in other's
<br>
interest to cooperate with a more free arrangement than to deny them. 
<br>
But I don't think that requires a majority.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;      There's a very relevant point here. I first learned about the Libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy/party listening to Norma Jean Almodovar (I know I've spelled that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong) being interviewed. She took questions from callers, and the one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sticks in my mind was the guy who told her Libertarianism 'was fine for those of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you with 130 IQs, but what about the rest of us? We need someone to take care of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us.' I am NOT making that up. The problem is that you assume your experience is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all there is, that no one could possibly think coercion is good. You are wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think history backs me up on this. Now, how do we deal with them? They do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still vote, and wield political power.
</em><br>
<p>Someone to take care of them?  Doesn't that translate to this guy saying
<br>
he has the right to enslave others for his benefit?  If so then why
<br>
should any decent people take such a statement seriously?   In fact
<br>
increased freedom has done more to increase the well-being of all
<br>
elements of society than any amount of chaining the more able to the
<br>
needs of the less able.  
<br>
<p>You are assuming what I assume.  Always a pointless proposition. 
<br>
Personally I have places where my own libertarianism is quite tempered. 
<br>
While I don't think it is correct to extract sums from one person's
<br>
wealth for the benefit of another against his/her will, I do question
<br>
whether the pure competition economic model can survive the singularity
<br>
or even several things leading up to it.  There is competition and then
<br>
there is meaningless competition for mere tokens regardless of actual
<br>
needs and values.  I just don't believe it is government's job to
<br>
determine actual needs and values.  As the world becomes more
<br>
techno-centric I can see possibilities that more people will become
<br>
disenfranchised under the common economic assumptions.  I don't have a
<br>
good idea what to do about that but I don't believe any sort of
<br>
redistribution of wealth by force is a good answer.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;  But if you can have the system be truly minimalist giving the people that do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see what needs doing the maximum freedom &gt;to proceed without coercion or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercing others, then that is probably the best that can be achieved.  Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively stupid &gt;people can see it is in their interest not to be coerced and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can even see what types of systems tend to produce the most &gt;goodies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, you're deciding beforehand what 'counts' and what doesn't and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telling people they're wrong because they don't agree with you. Who decides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's rational? On what basis? What's objective? What's reasonable?
</em><br>
<p><p>You seem to have studiously missed the point.  I made a statement about
<br>
what I think is the best that can be acheived and what historically
<br>
seems best.  You claim that I have prejudiced the conversation but you
<br>
have not shown this. I am telling you what I think and why.  If you
<br>
disagree then show me why instead of forbiding me effectively to have an
<br>
opinion or apply any criteria at all simply because some (or even most)
<br>
disagree with me.
<br>
<p>If you want to dissolve yourself in non-absolutism then have at it.  But
<br>
stop yelling at me for not joining you.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;      I keep trying to say, if people value things other than individual freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as their primary value, what you're doing will turn them off. They then go about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their lives, letting the statists get their way (since they espouse the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values, and haven't already prejudiced them by pissing them off) and we lose. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a problem with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Let them value whatever they want.  But if they come to deny me my
<br>
values with force then they deserve little but self-defensive force in
<br>
return.  
<br>
That people get pissed off when you disagree with them and attempt to
<br>
make a case for what you think  is a flaw of theirs, not of yours.  How
<br>
will you get anywhere by not trying to say what you believe and why the
<br>
best you can?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Right, according to whom? I keep trying to make the point that people are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; operating from libertarian values, theory, etc. and then violating them. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; simply do not think libertarian theory is right, they don't value what we do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;According to an objective view of what rights do and do not consist of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Which is the only thing that could possibly support any position on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;human ethics.  If they think differently then lets compare the quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;if the thinking, the reasoning and philosophy and its results (if any)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and decide which appears more reasonable.  Once again, truth is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;matter of opinion.  Some values are mostly opinion at the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;primitive state of our philosophies and knowledge.  But what is needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for humans to flourish is not arbitrary or infinitely malleable.  Truth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is not democratically arrived at.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HOW??? That is exactly what I'm trying to figure out here. Telling me all I need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do is build a rocket to get to the moon doesn't mean it's going to happen. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to know how. How are we going to minimize government, given that we're a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minority? How do we become a majority? How do we get what we need, even if we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a majority?
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.  Start a revolution or get the hell out of Dodge and found
<br>
something new?  Or slowly persuade more people by meeting them as close
<br>
to where they are as we can without compromising what we hold true. 
<br>
That it appears hopeless doesn't mean it shouldn't be done. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Then your only logical alternative is to do your best to minimize government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercion across the board so they don't stop &gt;those technologies from being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed.
</em><br>
<p><p>If I read you correctly you think all power is in the mob and almost
<br>
none in ideas and principles.  Yet that which brought us to this point
<br>
grew out of ideas and principles being applied to the problems of
<br>
government.  Do you see change as impossible?  What is it that you do
<br>
propose doing?
