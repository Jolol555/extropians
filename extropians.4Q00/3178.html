<p>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Instead, Mr. Brin didn't really argue anything in a substantive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  manner.  The little snippets that almost looked like sub-arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  were so loaded with false dilemmas and straw men that I gave up any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  idea of pointing them all out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then you missed the point of the article.
</em><br>
<p>Is missing the &quot;point&quot; the same as not buying into a fallacious argument?
<br>
<p>If so, then I guess I must have missed the point.
<br>
<p>Do you feel that Mr. Brin's argument was sound, or is your support 
<br>
more of a vague approval of his general theme?
<br>
<p>General themes and opinions are fine to have, but it's very important 
<br>
to couch them as such.  Mr. Brin's language resembles more of an 
<br>
argument, and since he is a professional writer, isn't it fair to 
<br>
assume that he knows what he's doing when he writes something for 
<br>
publication?  If so, then I hope you can understand why I'd want a 
<br>
clearly sound argument before I'd agree with it.
<br>
<p>As it is, his argument is overly loaded with fallacies.  Am I wrong 
<br>
to then not just accept his conclusions as valid?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; He claims to be mostly a Libertarian, but he actually votes for Democrats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yep.  Because he believes that Libertarian aims can be more effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;achieved by improving the system - which requires working within it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thus working with The Powers That Be - than the current ideal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;destroying the system and starting over (which is presumably what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;L candidates he voted against were promoting).
</em><br>
<p>He never explicitly mentioned voting &quot;against&quot; Libertarians.  He said 
<br>
that he voted &quot;for&quot; Democrats.  Whether that means that he wanted to 
<br>
vote for possible winners in a major party or he wanted to vote 
<br>
against a revolutionary LP candidate is unknowable from this piece - 
<br>
I find support for both positions.  They both seem equally likely so 
<br>
taking one side or the other would be special pleading.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Summary: passing and changing laws and instituations to promote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuality, rather than merely repealing/removing most or all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existing laws and institutions, is an approach that the public is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely to vote into office.  It is also more likely to bring better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;results in practice, even if either one were equally able to gain power.
</em><br>
<p>To be clear:  Are you also espousing this &quot;Libertarian goals through 
<br>
the Democratic party&quot; philosophy?
<br>
<p>If so, could you explain a little more in detail about how promoting 
<br>
the political party that believes in bigger government, higher income 
<br>
taxes, a de-emphasis on personal property, less personal 
<br>
responsibility, and severe gun control will obtain the benefits of 
<br>
the party that believes in minimal government, no income taxes, 
<br>
stronger property rights, higher individual responsibility, and 
<br>
protected gun rights?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
