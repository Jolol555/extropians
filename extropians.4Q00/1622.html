<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Can alcohol with non-corrosive additives be the fuel for regular,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  Would an alcohol-fueled combustion engine have any pollutant exhaust?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) What other room termperature liquid fuel replacements to gasoline exist?
</em><br>
<p>Turpentine was used as a fuel in IC engines prior to the use of gasoline.
<br>
Gasoline became popular because the industrial demand for turpentine made it
<br>
price prohibitive, while at the time gasoline was not used much commercially, it
<br>
was considered a waste product of the oil refining process, which focused
<br>
primarily on kerosene production, heating oil, and other more stable fuels.
<br>
Because it was considered 'waste', it was thus cheap to buy, and therefore
<br>
engines were designed that ran optimally on it. Deisel engines were developed in
<br>
parallel (which run essentially on kerosene). If you want to come up with an
<br>
alternative fuel, look at what fractions oil refineries either don't use or sell
<br>
at a loss. Many burn off the natural gas they pull out of oil, and many oil
<br>
wells vent to the atmosphere much of the natural gas that comes up out of the
<br>
ground with the oil. Recovering this natural gas instead is a current trend.
<br>
<p>Another idea is to build a producer or manufactured gas engine. This gas is
<br>
produced by passing steam through heated coal, and is primarily carbon monoxide
<br>
and hydrogen. Using this process on low grade coals that cannot be burned in
<br>
normal furnace installation allows the recovery of the caloric content of the
<br>
coal, while containing the waste products for proper environmental remediation.
<br>
In the 19th century, many cities used manufactured gas plants of this sort (The
<br>
site of Gasworks Park in Seattle comes to mind.) 
<br>
<p>However, this gas has only a 100-150 btu/cubic foot energy content, though this
<br>
can be boosted by spiking it with oil, up to 500 btu/cubic foot. Additionally,
<br>
only two fifths of the coal is turned into volatiles, the rest becoming coke and
<br>
other waste products that can be expensive to dispose of safely.
<br>
<p>Other ideas for improving efficiency:
<br>
<a href="http://www.connessor.lu/">http://www.connessor.lu/</a> - a concept that uses two cylinders per combustion
<br>
chamber, which increases efficiency 30-50%
<br>
<p>Alcohol, as derived from biomass, has been demonstrated here on the list to be a
<br>
major DUMB IDEA in the mass market, although as a niche market in the midwest
<br>
and other cereal crop producing regions to process waste grain that would
<br>
normally be market losses, it has its place.
<br>
<p>Geneticists should be spending their time designing a gene splice to cause human
<br>
skin cells to construct silicon and gallium arsenide solar cells within
<br>
themselves, which then close their circuits when the cells die and dry up in the
<br>
outer skin surface. The currents would enter the body at the fingernails and
<br>
toenails and travel through the calcium of the bones to power glycerin producing
<br>
cells as well as nanites and electronic implants. We can then join the Plant
<br>
Liberation Front and go on raids to sabotage harvesting machines, cotton gins,
<br>
and Kellogs cereal plants.... ;)
