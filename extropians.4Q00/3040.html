Ok, I've come up with a very useful, money making use for quantum
<br>
entanglement and wormhole technology here on earth in the here and now:
<br>
instant mail ordering. Lets say I am leaving on a trip, and I want that
<br>
pair of LL Bean docksiders for this trip, TODAY, or maybe I'm on a trip,
<br>
and I wanted them before I left. I call up an LL Bean operator, and
<br>
place my order and say I want to receive it today (or maybe last week
<br>
some time). The order goes through the Wormhole Area Network Loop to
<br>
return to the server two weeks ago. The order gets processed in that
<br>
batch then, giving plenty of time for the LL Bean to ship by the slowest
<br>
method (thus saving the most money on shipping) and still getting you
<br>
your product today, or else before you left on your trip. The only
<br>
difficulty I see is dealing with the looping perceptions if you receive
<br>
the product before you order it. People will get products before they
<br>
order them, refuse to accept the shipment, then bitch when they need
<br>
them, order the product, only to have the operator say,&quot;We sent you
<br>
those shoes last week but you refused the shipment, though you still owe
<br>
us for shipping. We're putting it on your quantum credit card, so you've
<br>
already paid, thanks. Have a nice day!&quot;
