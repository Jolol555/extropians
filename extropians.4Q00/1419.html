<p>
For those of you who read Ian Arcatling's first message, it is only fair to
<br>
inform you that it was apparently sparked by my recent mailing of Member
<br>
Updates and Renewal Requests, which many of you have already received.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     There are probably those on this list who consider joining the ExI.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would therefore like to warn them: since you get nothing for your money if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you send it to the ExI, you might as well flush it down the toilet.  I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certain that you can use that money better.
</em><br>
<p>Hi Ian.  Greg Burch has made a lot of key points in his earlier response,
<br>
but I would like to reiterate that membership dues are what create the
<br>
conferences (recently, Extro-4) and keep Extropy Institute growing.  Now,
<br>
more than ever, there are a lot of projects being developed by ExI, as you
<br>
would have seen in your copy of the Updates; this includes the probability
<br>
of an ExI Membership Retreat in the coming year.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      The first thing that &quot;happened&quot; was nothing -- that is, I couldn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even get any confirmation that my membership fee had actually reached the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ExI.  Eventually I started sending emails to people whose address was on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Extropy site, asking if they had received the money.  Still nothing.  No 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reply.  After half a year of sending emails to people who according to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Extropy site were representatives of the ExI, I finally received 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;confirmation that my money had indeed arrived, and that I was registered as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a member.  That was all.  Then nothing again.
</em><br>
<p>As of a few weeks ago, I have been made the Operations Officer of Extropy
<br>
Institute, and I am currently handling all membership related duties,
<br>
including sending out regular updates and maintaining frequent
<br>
communication with members.  From now on I give my personal guarantee that
<br>
there will be regular contact with all ExI members and that all queries
<br>
about anything to do with operational administration will be answered
<br>
promptly.
<br>
