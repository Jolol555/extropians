<em>&gt;&gt;What about a murderer who is not a caring sentient person, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;a monster, annoyed with being incarcerated for what he see's as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;something the victim deserved for rejecting him, and never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;showing the slightest remorse. (yes, this is from personnal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;experience)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; You fail to address the issue of proper punishment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;A person of the type described is suffering from a possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;curable mental condition, almost certainly curable a bit down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;line.
</em><br>
<p>The person in the above case is a diagnosed sociopath, without any
<br>
regard for his fellow man. It is too late for a cure, even if one
<br>
existed, which it does not.
<br>
<p>If he was executed, with his individual molecules scattered to the
<br>
most distant portions of the universe so that if in the event of a
<br>
&quot;Big Crunch&quot; they were the last to be assembled, it would be too
<br>
kind a fate.
<br>
<p>Clear enough?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&quot;Proper punishment&quot; presumes that punishment actually accomplishes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something worthwhile.  Yet it has been demonstrated that execution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not a real deterrent and a punishment that kills the offender
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly cannot be said to rehabilitate them.  
</em><br>
<p>I am not interested in &quot;proper punishment&quot;, but &quot;just punishment&quot;.
<br>
<p>As I have already stated, the death penalty as currently practiced
<br>
will not  have a deterrent effect. I am not interested in
<br>
rehabilitating a murderer since the just punishment is for them to
<br>
face a punishment equal to the crime.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In the case of a non-psychotic person a &quot;proper punishment&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather &quot;making what restitution is possible&quot; might involve picking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up most/all of the slain person's debts and obligations or being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indentured to the family for a period of time.  Or not.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question I was attempting to address was as in the topic line. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not what the proper response to murder outside of execution vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suspension is.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, as as I stated I am against cryo-suspension for death row
<br>
inmates, because their sentence is to be &quot;final&quot; death.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;How can a sentient, caring person condemn another human being to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;irreversible and irretrievable death?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;When that human being has committed an irreversible crime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;All irreverisble crimes?  Like damaging property irreverisbly for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instance?  Again, how does creating another irreversible loss in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any way balance out the original one?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I have already stated the death penalty is only for the crime of
<br>
murder.
<br>
<p><p>The loss of a murderer is no loss at all.
