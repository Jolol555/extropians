According to <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,40356,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,40356,00.html</a>
<br>
Stephen King has suspended work on his online novel The Plant, which he
<br>
had been releasing in installments on a pay as you go basis.  This was
<br>
considered a possible model for authors to be rewarded financially in
<br>
a world where intellectual property protection is becoming uncertain.
<br>
<p>&quot;Originally King said he would keep writing if readers kept paying. By
<br>
part four, only 46 percent of the people who downloaded the book paid
<br>
for it&quot;
<br>
<p>The target percentage was 75%, which is about what the first couple of
<br>
chapters pulled in.  Apparently it has been falling since then.
<br>
<p>Sounds like we need to go back to the drawing boards to come up with a
<br>
new idea to pay for IP.  Anyone who has sat through the annoying pledge
<br>
breaks on PBS will know that it's not easy to get people to pay for
<br>
something they can get for free.
