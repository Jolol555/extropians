<p>
First, let me say that after 3 days, I'm really digging this list serve.  I
<br>
haven't been part of one for a long while and I'm throughly enjoying the
<br>
depth of thought and intelligence exhibited in the various threads.
<br>
<p>Anders, thanks for a good quick overview about mysticism, sprituality and
<br>
magick.  Yes, I think most of Crowleyian magick is rather archaic and he did
<br>
get too caught up in supernatural experiences or states of consciousness.
<br>
However, I think that magick is a legtimate tool for focusing the will an
<br>
producing change.  By practicing magick, you are able to focus your
<br>
consicousness in ritual so reinforce new thought connections.  NLP and
<br>
cognitive therapy may be better tools than most magick.  But it seems that
<br>
most people practicing magick are riding the regress express back to the
<br>
archaic.  Could magick be re-invented.  I think yes.
<br>
<p>As for mysticism, I agree with your statement:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Where it may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;helpful is on the emotional level, in getting a feel for how wonderful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the universe is or how we ourselves fit in with it.
</em><br>
<p>That is why mysticism has power to generate insight.  It centers you in the
<br>
universe so you can connect with you deep will.  I think that mystical
<br>
practices are necessary to strengthen that part.  Once you have the insight,
<br>
than yes, follow it and test it rationally.  But when I go to my rational
<br>
thought for insight, all I get is a bunch of weighing pros and cons and feel
<br>
de-centered.
<br>
<p>After reading the extropian principles, I understand the need to put
<br>
emotions and insight in their proper place.  However, it seems to me that
<br>
there's too much minimization of those too qualities of human life.  Yes,
<br>
much of human experience and history has been plagued by unchecked emotion.
<br>
But let's not reverse the swing in the opposite direction.  I would prefer
<br>
to see an understanding put forth that expresses a relationship between
<br>
insight, emotion, and rational as though they were equals, each with their
<br>
own realm of action.  Do any extropians view it this way?
