<em>&gt; The first law of thermodynamics states that &quot;You can't win&quot;; you cannot

<em>&gt; decrease the amount of entropy in the Universe.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I think this is the second law; the first law is conservation
<br>
of energy.  However in some of your perpetual motion machines you seem
<br>
to be violating the first law more than the second.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hence, the first law of thermodynamics.  A high-entropy system occupies a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large volume of phase space.  A hot piece of metal occupies a larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volume of phase space than a cold piece of metal, since the range of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible velocities for a particle is larger.  A physical process which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned a hot piece of metal into a cold piece of metal plus electricity -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaving the rest of the Universe constant - would be a process that turned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a large area of phase space into a small area, violating the theorem. 
</em><br>
<p>Assuming, as is reasonable, that the electricity had only a small
<br>
phase space.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The first type of perpetual motion machine, the negative-energy method,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says that you can manufacture X amount of negative matter, X amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive matter, pour all your waste heat into the newly created matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then annihilate it, getting rid of the waste heat.  Each time a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative particle and a positive particle come into existence, it changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the total volume of the Hamiltonian phase space - by adding entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dimensions, in fact.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, in classical thermodynamics there is no such thing as negative
<br>
matter, and if there were I'm not sure if it would have negative entropy.
<br>
However it would arguably have negative energy, so if you were worried
<br>
about satisfying the first (not second) law of thermodynamics, this part
<br>
could in principle work if negative matter were real.
<br>
<p>However I'm not sure it makes sense to explain that the whole idea works
<br>
because of increasing the volume of phase space due to adding particles.
<br>
If all it took to violate thermodynamic laws were to change the number
<br>
of particles, it would happen all the time.  Chemical reactions change
<br>
the number of molecules, which is often what we count in thermodynamics,
<br>
and nuclear reactions can change the number of subatomic particles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When you annihilate the particles, the total volume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shrinks again.  In effect, the Type One perpetual motion machine increases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the total volume of the Universe's Hamiltonian, which means that you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose to wind up in a smaller area (relatively speaking) of that larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hamiltonian.  Then you shrink the Hamiltonian back down again by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annihilating the matter, but you do so in a way which means that you end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up in a smaller area of your own Hamiltonian.  In other words, when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase the size of the Hamiltonian, you perform a one-to-one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transformation of your phase space into that Hamiltonian; then, when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hamiltonian shrinks, you perform a many-to-one transformation; taken as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete operation, this shrinks the size of your phase space.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think this part will work.  Keep in mind that systems don't
<br>
actually occupy volumes of phase space, they occupy points.  Think of
<br>
families of systems, each at a different point in the phase space that
<br>
makes up the volume.  To perform a transformation which shrinks the phase
<br>
space means that some initially distinct members of that family have now
<br>
merged and are identical.  This requires nonreversible transformations,
<br>
and I don't see anything here which is nonreversible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The second type of perpetual motion machine, the quantum, notes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state-vector reduction again reduces the volume of phase space.  A large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volume of phase space, describing the probability amplitude that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electron is present at all points of space, collapses into a single point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which describes the electron as being present at a single point in space. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; State-vector reduction takes zillions of possible superposed Universes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annihilates all but one of them.  Thus, it may be possible to build a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum perpetual motion machine in which the amplitudes &quot;cold states&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to add up while the amplitudes of &quot;hot states&quot; cancel out;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively, this dumps waste heat into a superposed state that gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blipped out of existence when the quantum collapse occurs.
</em><br>
<p>If you think of a many worlds model, any such attempt would not actually
<br>
blip any other universes out of existence, but rather it simply allows
<br>
you to learn where you are in the multiverse.  Learning where you are
<br>
can't change the overall statistics of what happens.  So I think this
<br>
blipping-out is a bad model and misleading about what could happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The third type of perpetual motion machine, the temporal, says that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can violate the first law using a time machine.  If you take a heat bath
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and watch it evolving through states for a sufficiently long time, you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide to stop watching at a point where all the atoms on one side happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be moving in the same direction.  The volume of phase space has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserved at all points within the temporal loop, but from the perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the rest of the Universe, the heat bath rejoins our world only when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occupies a particular volume of phase space.  Pieces of a sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large physical system will show temporary decreases in entropy due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operation of normal, random mechanisms; a time machine lets you take all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the temporary decreases, unsynchronize them temporally, and resynchronize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them so that they all add together.  In other words, the phase space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remains constant if you evolve *all* of it for N minutes, but if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolve some of it for N minutes and some of it for M minutes, the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volumes may overlap; the total volume may not be constant.
</em><br>
<p>Maxwell's Demon can accomplish the same task and he doesn't even have
<br>
a time machine, he just opens the door at the right time.  It's the
<br>
measurement process that defeats him, and I suspect the same thing will
<br>
happen to you.  Knowing when to stop time requires measuring the atoms to
<br>
know when they are all moving together.  That is costly.  (Technically it
<br>
is in the erasure of the measurements that we account for the cost.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In saying that a dropped glass will fall downwards, we are making a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement that one volume of phase space - the phase space of dropped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glasses - will evolve into another phase space; the phase space of glasses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lying on the floor.  Both volumes of phase space are extremely large, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are relatively compact, and a point in the core volume of the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phase space ends up in the core volume of the second phase space, *most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time* - they are fuzzy, but not very fuzzy.  The phase spaces are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compact and their evolution is compact, but will never be perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compact in an inperfect Universe.  Watch long enough, and you'll see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glasses falling upwards.
</em><br>
<p>It's not that the phase spaces of falling-glass and dropped-glass are
<br>
fuzzy; they may be perfectly well defined.  Rather, not all of the first
<br>
volume ends up within the second.  A little bit is outside, representing
<br>
dropped glasses which don't break.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This phenomenon is what people refer to when they say that perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational thought is impossible.
</em><br>
<p>Where'd this come from?  I've never heard anyone say this, at least
<br>
not in those words.  A google search for &quot;perfectly rational thought&quot;
<br>
finds no such claim.  (Of course most people would agree that any form
<br>
of perfection is unatttainable.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Turing's diagonalization theorem can be expressed as follows:  A mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot perfectly describe itself because there is always, inescapably,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some part of the mind which at that moment is observing and is not itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being observed.  The observer is always smaller than the observed, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus cannot perfectly describe it.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not convinced of this argument.  It sounds like it could equally well
<br>
&quot;prove&quot; that self-reproducing automata are impossible, because they have
<br>
to have a model of themselves, and the model is always smaller than
<br>
the total automaton, hence there must be part that can't be modelled.
<br>
When people first go to write a self reproducing program they run into
<br>
this, and in some cases they may conclude that it is impossible, if
<br>
they don't stumble onto the trick.  Yet von Neumann showed and biology
<br>
confirms that self reproduction is entirely possible.
<br>
<p>I'd say the reason is that the model is isomorphic (via some mapping)
<br>
to the system minus the model, and so adding the model does not increase
<br>
the information in the system.
<br>
<p>Couldn't a mind's mental model share the same property?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that your version of the diagonalization argument is to ask the AI:  &quot;Will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI you're simulating answer 'No' to this question?&quot;  Ve knows that, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soon as ve decides to answer &quot;Yes, it will say No&quot; or &quot;No, it will say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes&quot;, through whatever output mechanism has been provided, the AI ve's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulating will make the exact same answer, thus invalidating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;AI, will you answer 'No' to this question?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Of course not.&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't think this kind of trick question sheds much light.  It's just
<br>
playing with words.  An AI with an incomplete model is no more able to
<br>
answer the question than one with a complete model.  An AI with a fully
<br>
complete model of itself, one which understands itself perfectly, can't
<br>
give a consistent or correct answer, but that doesn't indicate a lack
<br>
of understanding; it is simply that the question is a trick.  In effect
<br>
it is being asked two questions at once: what is the next word you will
<br>
say, and will you say &quot;no&quot;.  There is no way to answer this question if
<br>
we stick to yes or no answers!  The existence of unanswerable questions
<br>
fails to prove that beings can't fully understand themselves.
<br>
<p>The problem with the analysis is that it assumes that the AI understands
<br>
itself in a very simplistic and mechanical manner.  The only way it can
<br>
answer the question is by running its own program by brute force.
<br>
<p>It's like the person who wants to write a self-reproducing program, who
<br>
starts out with:
<br>
<p>main(){
<br>
putchar ('m');
<br>
putchar ('a');
<br>
putchar ('i');
<br>
putchar ('n');
<br>
putchar ('(');
<br>
putchar (')');
<br>
putchar ('{');
<br>
putchar ('\n');
<br>
putchar ('p');
<br>
putchar ('u');
<br>
putchar ('t');
<br>
...
<br>
<p>He soon realizes that this isn't going to work.  He's losing ground with
<br>
every statement he writes.  The real solution takes an entirely different
<br>
approach.
<br>
<p>In the same way, a perfectly self-understanding AI could have a more subtle
<br>
model of its own workings.
<br>
<p>This is not necessarily a violation of the halting theorem.  The AI does
<br>
not claim to be capable of telling whether arbitrary programs will halt.
<br>
It is probably not even Turing complete, in the sense that it can't
<br>
necessarily run any arbitrary program &quot;in its head&quot; (people certainly
<br>
can't).
<br>
<p>In truth, the notion of self-understanding is not very well defined.
<br>
To continue this further it will be necessary to have a more rigorous
<br>
definition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, someone could still argue that even &quot;effective perfection&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unattainable - that a transhuman will, of necessity, make factual errors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or insane-class mistakes at least once a month - but if so, it will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be an argument on grounds of cognitive science, rather than mathematics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or computer science.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt that anyone sensible would say such a thing about transhumans
<br>
in general.  Estimating the mean time between errors for any complex
<br>
system requires a detailed specification.  Once that is in hand, I would
<br>
imagine that the task would more likely be a matter of materials science
<br>
than cognitive.
