<p><em> &gt; Alright, let's play a hypothetical game.  Let us suppose that there was
</em><br>
<em> &gt; intelligent life on Mars.  We discovered them when we were first able-- many
</em><br>
<em> &gt; years ago.  Everything else is equal.  Today, we look up into the cosmos--
</em><br>
<em> &gt; nothing.  Just us Earthlings and Martians, staring up into the vastness of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; space.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This is much better than you cetaceans example, but it still won't
<br>
quite do, because Mars and Earth are near enough to be
<br>
crosscontaminated by ejecta. That way if both planets can support
<br>
life, and one planet kindles, the second will be very soon to follow
<br>
by infection. But that way you can at least assume that
<br>
cerebralisation is deterministic, to a fairly high degree of
<br>
certainty (well, the nucleating critters are the same).
<br>
<p>A better comparison would be if you could get an intelligent life sign
<br>
from a nearby stellar system. Whatever biases are then present, they
<br>
are then common to our galactic neighbourhood. If the second blip
<br>
comes from another galaxy, then it simultaneously shows you that
<br>
nucleation density is about ~1 in a galaxy, and that our galaxy is not
<br>
unique (e.g. the singularity at the center is matter-starved, and
<br>
hence unusually silent). Blips from afar are preferable.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; Independent of the additional statistical information (disparate life forms
</em><br>
<em> &gt; evolving under differing conditions as an additional data set to assist in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; calculating environments under which life comes about,) explain how this
</em><br>
<em> &gt; second data point defeats the observational selection effect inherent in the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; anthropic principle.
</em><br>
<p>It does not entirely eliminate the bias due to proximity, but it goes
<br>
a few step towards it (cerebralisation kinetics, would be great to
<br>
compare the two fossil records).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; Remember: no matter how small a fraction of all solar systems in our
</em><br>
<em> &gt; infinite universe develop life, we would by neccessity find that we
</em><br>
<em> &gt; (Earthlings and Martians) originate from one of the exceptional ones that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; did. 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Following me here?
</em><br>
<p>Not really.
