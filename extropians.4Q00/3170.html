<em>&gt; Sitting on the fence does little but give you splinters in your ass, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make you a sniper target for both sides. A flexible mind posesses the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to make up one's mind at some point, preferably before the end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of time. A notorious fence sitter is as rigid of mind about refusing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide as any partisan is about decisions made.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think of myself as a fence-sitter... I think of myself as an
<br>
thought-dancer.  I make up my mind as is best suited to my current
<br>
objective, whatever that may be.  At the moment, I'm just cruising the
<br>
latest ideoloptions, looking for whichever long term paradigms seem to offer
<br>
the most promise, the most problems, the most conflicts, and the most fun.
<br>
Perhaps the best of them can be grafted together to form a fine new beast?
<br>
Chaocreationary Thelemextropianism, anybody?
<br>
<p>-Nicq (who plans to be long deanimated, dissolved into the kisses of Nuit,
<br>
scattered to the primordial chaos, or assimilated into the
<br>
superconsciousness by the time the end comes around...)
