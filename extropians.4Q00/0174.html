<p><em>&gt; Side question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is the novel titled _The Cassini Division_  ??
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't see anything about Saturn's rings in your description....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Perhaps it's something only a planetary scientist might wonder about.)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From the novel:
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The Cassini Division...In astronomy, the Cassini Dvision is a dark band
<br>
in the rings of Saturn.  In the astronautics of the Heliocene Epoch, the
<br>
Cassini Division was the proud name - originally given in jest - of a dark
<br>
band indeed, a military force in the ring of Jupiter.  You know about the
<br>
ring of Jupiter - but to us it was more than a remarkable product of
<br>
planetary engineering, it was a standing reminder of the power of our
<br>
enemies.  It was our Guantanamo, our Berlin Wall.  (Look them up.  Earth
<br>
history.  There are files.) 
<br>
<p>The Cassini Division was the Solar Union's front-line force, our
<br>
collective fist in the enemy's face.  In our classless society it was the
<br>
closest thing to an elite; in our anarchy, the nearest we came to a state;
<br>
in our commonwealth, it held the greastest share of riches.  Its recruits
<br>
chose themselves, and not many could meet a standard of that rigour.  In
<br>
terms of sheer fire power the Division could have flattened all the states
<br>
Earth ever knew, and still had enough left over for a bit of target
<br>
practice to occupy the afternoon.  The resources it controlled could have
<br>
bought everything on Earth, in the age when that world was owned - and it
<br>
still stood ready for the exchange, to give as good as it got, to pit our
<br>
human might against the puny wrath of gods.
<br>
<p>In other words...the Division was there to kick post-human ass.  And we
<br>
did.
<br>
<p>(And yes.  I'm still proud of it.)&quot;
