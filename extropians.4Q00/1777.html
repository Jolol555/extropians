<em>&gt; Why don't you just bite the bullet and tell us that their theory doesn't

</em><br>
<em>&gt; give yourself in ten years $1 more to spend then, and how much would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be willing to spend today to give yourself ten years ago $1 more to spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then, assuming we could arrange a time machine to implement this choice?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think this is quite the right question to ask, in terms of
<br>
evaluating their proposed remedy.  You are asking about a one-time event,
<br>
giving up something today for a benefit ten years ago that I might not
<br>
remember.  However their remedy would have continuous, long term effect.
<br>
I might not remember a specific day ten years ago, but I would remember
<br>
the overall tone of my life in those days.
<br>
<p>The real question is, it seems to me, is would I have been happier over
<br>
the course of my life if I had generally saved more for the future, and
<br>
consumed less in each moment of the present.  Should I have sacrificed
<br>
current happiness in favor of postponed gratification?  Would that have
<br>
given me a happier and more satisified life?
<br>
<p>This is what their remedy would do.  It would coerce or persuade me
<br>
to delay present pleasures into the future.  Their claim is that most
<br>
people would be happier, in general, if this were done to them.
<br>
<p>My answer to the question in this form is, no, I don't think this would
<br>
make me happier.  Of course, having more would be good, generally,
<br>
and delaying consumption would make me wealthier.  But this will come
<br>
at a constant, gnawing cost, of giving up the pleasures which make life
<br>
so enjoyable.  It is this ongoing cost which I think is missed by the
<br>
question as you formulated it.  A life of deferred gratification is a life
<br>
of sacrifice and frustration.  I believe that if we fully internalize and
<br>
understand that cost, that we will come to understand that past pleasures
<br>
are very worthwhile, even when we have forgotten the specific details.
