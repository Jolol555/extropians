<em>&gt; &gt;   This is the same sort of argument fanatics give to prove the existance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of god. Since there is absolutely no positive evidence in favour of either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ETs or god, the simplest and most plausible explanation of this fact is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that neither ETs nor god exist. This is a brutally obviously argument to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any rational individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Except for the brutally obvious fact that intelligence does in fact exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and is a product of natural processes of the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can't we, Doug, at the very least, attach probabilties to the likelihood of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence spontaneously arising at other spatial coordinates in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence matrix?
</em><br>
<p>Despite what some people may say, if we are to use our own existence as evidence
<br>
for intelligent ET life, then we can only accept those conditions under which
<br>
our own intelligence evolved:
<br>
<p>G3 sol-type stable yellow dwarf star
<br>
terrestrial planet w/ ~1 G surface gravity
<br>
oxygen nitrogen atmosphere of ~1 bar sea level pressure
<br>
abundant water
<br>
active plate tectonic system
<br>
large moon to generate magnetic field and tectonic system
<br>
average surface temp ~20 C
<br>
planetary orbital eccentricity not to be more than .90 (i.e. roughly circular or
<br>
better)
<br>
additional planets to inspire astronomical and mathematical sciences via
<br>
observation.
<br>
x light years from any supernova, GRB, or other catastrophic interstellar
<br>
phenomena.
<br>
<p>We cannot simply try to imagine various other 'possible' ecosytems under which
<br>
life would have developed, because we have absolutely no evidence that such
<br>
schemes could evolve intelligence, while we know our local one can.
<br>
<p>Now, we currently have no idea how many such planets are out there. Given that
<br>
we find that many jovian and superjovian planets seem to inhabit inner system
<br>
orbits for so many sol type stars, we may go so far as to posit that moons of
<br>
such planets may fit the bill (and the tidal influence of the parent planet
<br>
satisfy tidal, magnetic, and tectonic requirements.) We have found a few earth
<br>
sized planets orbiting white dwarfs/netron stars, it seems, but whether such
<br>
planets would be inhabited or merely burned out cinders remains to be seen, but
<br>
they DO give a good idea of the population of such terrestrial sized planets MAY
<br>
be for the stars they evolved from (i.e. when their star was in the yellow dwarf
<br>
range of the main sequence), so we may extrapolate from this the probability of
<br>
terrestrial sized planets around current sol type stars that are to active for
<br>
us to detect their smaller planets at this time.
