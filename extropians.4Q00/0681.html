<em>&gt;Notice that under this conception it makes little sense to imagine a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computer in a small lab suddenly breaking through to super-intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Intelligence increases would be the result of breakthroughs all across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;globe, and the compute cycles in any one lab would only be a very small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fraction of that total.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I question the appropriateness of using Flynn effect theories to predict
<br>
machine intelligence increases (but I suspect you are right that super-
<br>
intelligence will result from widespread breakthroughs).
<br>
&nbsp;My current hypothesis for what is causing the Flynn effect is based on
<br>
the kind of sexual selection that is described in The Mating Mind. I
<br>
claim that women alter the importance they attach to intelligence in
<br>
mate selection in response to changes in the relative importance of
<br>
intelligence as a measure of a man's ability to earn a reliable living.
<br>
The industrial and information revolutions caused an increase in the
<br>
importance of mental abilities (especially the ability to handle
<br>
abstractions) and a decrease in the importance of alternative measures
<br>
such as physical strength. We should expect this to cause an increase in
<br>
evolutionary pressure for increased intelligence.
<br>
&nbsp;Note that this hypothesis hints that the Flynn effect exaggerates the
<br>
increase in intelligence, as it implies the increase is concentrated
<br>
among those subsets of intelligence that are useful at modern jobs, and
<br>
I suspect IQ tests measure those subsets more than they measure the
<br>
ability to produce art or to model other people's minds.
<br>
&nbsp;One (difficult) way this hypothesis could be tested is to measure when the
<br>
Flynn effect starts in different parts of the world, to see whether it
<br>
correlates with when intellectual labor significantly replaces manual labor.
<br>
&nbsp;I doubt that artificial intelligence will have any comparable
<br>
mechanism, at least if it happens at all quickly. Sexual selection requires
<br>
a fairly sophisticated ability to model other individuals. AI will probably
<br>
need a process with the power of sexual selection before achieving that
<br>
sophistication.
