<p>Well, I *feel* funny.  But no, its been so long I couldnt recall
<br>
what it was called.  One of my classmates was Chinese and
<br>
the way he pronounced the word, it was difficult to tell if he
<br>
was saying Algol or Algor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that you mean Algol.   I thought it was a cool language.
</em><br>
<p>I never used it myself.  Back in those days I was still hacking
<br>
at assembly language, for a 6502 and a Z80.  Many of the list
<br>
members will have no idea what I am talking about with those
<br>
terms, but just dismiss it as one of those barbarian practices
<br>
that was done in the dark ages, along with chiselling ASCII
<br>
code into granite punch cards, and floppy disks the size of a
<br>
spare tire.  {8^D

<p>Oh, yes, thats another thing from the old days, my young friends.
<br>
We used to get software by having the code printed out in
<br>
a magazine.  Then we typed it into our computer.  And ran it.
<br>
Programs were shorter in those days.  {8^D  spike
