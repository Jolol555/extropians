<p>Umm, that's WY_S_IWIG. 
<br>
<p>Ironic that one of your listed &quot;similar&quot; things (all the popular M$
<br>
apps, evidently, lumped together) yield files you *really* don't want to
<br>
manipulate by hand. 
<br>
<p>I'd say the closest direct parallel to HTML in the text-processing field
<br>
is probably ROFF/NROFF/TROFF and variants, and you'll notice what a huge
<br>
market share they've garnered today. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The goals of machine readability, etc, etc, of XML are laudable. How long do
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I can predict one thing about the future of the Web. It will continue to
<br>
suck, but not quite as much as not having it.
<br>
<p>I'm not real fond of gravy, either (feh!). :)
<br>
<p>OTOH, nobody (==&quot;not enough bodies&quot;) so far seems to have wanted
<br>
xanalogical storage very badly, and that's pretty much &quot;soup&quot;. People
<br>
have gotten used to herding piles of named files around, even though
<br>
that's like calling a houseful of mice by name.
