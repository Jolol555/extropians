</em><br>
<p><p>You mostly missed the point.  What I was talking about is irrelevant to
<br>
the final state of the Turing machine.  What I was stating was that for
<br>
any finite state machine, even very complex ones, it is possible to both
<br>
predict the next operation of the machine and be able to calculate the
<br>
error rate for such a prediction in a relatively small amount of memory. 
<br>
So while I may not know how a finite-state machine will terminate, I can
<br>
always give a relatively precise answer as to what it will do *next*.  And
<br>
for many classes of problems, this is good enough.  
<br>
<p>In fact, this is arguably more useful in many ways.  Outside of idle
<br>
curiousity, I am more concerned with what happens in the universe (or
<br>
stock market) next than I am with how the universe will finally end.  Given
<br>
that this is provably possible for any finite state machine (and relatively
<br>
trivial to implement in practice), I prefer this approach to the provable
<br>
difficulty of what you are talking about above. :^)
<br>
<p>As an interesting aside, the same areas of mathematics would also suggest
<br>
that an accurate predictor of the universe itself could be developed with
<br>
realistically accessible levels of computer technology i.e. almost
<br>
certainly possible within the next hundred years.  At this point
<br>
we are more missing the data than the computational ability, though
<br>
non-trivial in either case.
