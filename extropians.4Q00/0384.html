I've been waiting for a list like this, not for its intended reasons.
<br>
<p><p><p><a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20001004/sc/biotech_list_dc_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20001004/sc/biotech_list_dc_1.html</a>
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The anti-biotech group Greenpeace issued a ``shopping 
<br>
list'' on Wednesday outlining thousands of brand-name cereals, snacks, 
<br>
frozen dinners and other foods that contain genetically-altered corn, 
<br>
soybeans and other ingredients.
<br>
<p>The activist group said it published the list on its web site, along with a 
<br>
list of foods that do not contain gene-spliced ingredients, to give 
<br>
consumers a choice at the grocery store.
<br>
<p>``While food companies have eliminated genetically engineered ingredients in 
<br>
Europe, the shopping list is the only way American consumers can avoid 
<br>
genetically engineered contaminated food,'' said Charles Margulis, a 
<br>
Greenpeace food spokesman.
<br>
<p>Japan, Australia, Italy, Britain and a dozen other nations now require 
<br>
labels on foods containing genetically-altered ingredients.
<br>
<p>U.S. regulators have rejected pressure from activist groups for similar 
<br>
labelling requirements, saying the foods are no different from those grown 
<br>
with conventional crops.
<br>
<p>Labelling has been thrust into the spotlight with the Food and Drug 
<br>
Administration (news - web sites)'s current investigation into how a biotech 
<br>
corn variety ended up in taco shells, even though it wasn't approved for 
<br>
human food. The taco shells were recalled because of concern that some 
<br>
people could be allergic to the corn.
<br>
<p>The FDA is expected to soon issue voluntary guidelines for U.S. companies 
<br>
that want to add a label saying a food does or does not include biotech 
<br>
ingredients.
<br>
<p>American food companies, which oppose mandatory labels, said the new 
<br>
Greenpeace shopping list failed to tell consumers that regulators have found 
<br>
all the foods safe.
<br>
<p>``These products are safe and adhere to science-based federal food 
<br>
regulations already on the books,'' said Karil Kochenderfer, a trade 
<br>
official with the Grocery Manufacturers of America.
<br>
<p>``Activist opponents of food biotechnology need to do their homework on the 
<br>
studies done by the National Academy of Sciences and other authoritative 
<br>
bodies on products derived through biotechnology,'' he added.
<br>
<p>The U.S. biotech industry contends gene-spliced foods are just as safe as 
<br>
conventional ones, and have been subjected to more safety and environmental 
<br>
tests.
<br>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences issued a report earlier this year that 
<br>
cautiously endorsed the safety of biofoods but called for more study into 
<br>
long-term health and environmental effects.
<br>
<p>The Greenpeace list was posted on the Internet at www.truefoodnow.org.
