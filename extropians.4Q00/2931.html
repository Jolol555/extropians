<p>
I've been thinking about what each of these words connate and wanted to
<br>
share some thoughts and see what people think in response.
<br>
<p>Regardless of the term being used to designate our interests, what needs to
<br>
be communicated is the desire to transcend human limitation.  I do not think
<br>
that this means to become unhuman or inhuman, but rather more than human or
<br>
human plus or superhuman.  And I believe this will have to be the case, as
<br>
every stage of evolution incorporates the benefits of preceding forms while
<br>
transcending their limitations.  Thus, I don't think there will be a break
<br>
from humanity.  AI will not become some new form that transcends us.
<br>
Rather, we develop AI and incorporate it into us.
<br>
<p>There is, however, a lot of fear in most humans regarding integration of
<br>
technology into the human species.  And it seems to me that Posthuman can be
<br>
easily misinterpreted by the fearful to be the end of humanity, a sort of
<br>
death to the species as the great computer emerges.  That is why I tend to
<br>
prefer Transhuman.  I have often heard transhuman being referred to as the
<br>
interim stage or those of us or are working at becoming posthuman.  But I
<br>
use it much like many use posthuman.  Transhumanism better represents our
<br>
desire to incorporate the best of being human while transcending our limits.
<br>
It is more digestible to fearful people with whom I try to share my positive
<br>
outlook on these topics.
<br>
<p>Anyone have any thoughts on this?
