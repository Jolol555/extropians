Abstract
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential activities of butylated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hydroxyanisole (BHA), myo-inositol, curcumin, esculetin,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;resveratrol and lycopene-enriched tomato oleoresin (LTO) as chemopreventive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;agents against lung tumor induction in A/J mice by the tobacco smoke
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;carcinogens benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4-(methyl-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) were evaluated. Groups
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of 20 A/J mice were treated weekly by gavage with a mixture of BaP and NNK (3
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;micromol each) for 8 weeks, then sacrificed 26 weeks after the first
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;carcinogen treatment. Mice treated with BHA (20 or 40 micromol) by gavage 2 h
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;before each dose of BaP and NNK had significantly reduced lung tumor
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;multiplicity. Treatment with BHA (20 or 40 micromol) by gavage weekly or with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dietary BHA (2000 ppm), curcumin (2000 ppm) or resveratrol (500 ppm) from 1
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;week after carcinogen treatment until termination had no effect on lung tumor
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;multiplicity. Treatment with dietary myo-inositol (30,000 ppm) or esculetin
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(2000 ppm) from 1 week after carcinogen treatment until termination
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significantly reduced lung tumor multiplicity, with the effect of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;myo-inositol being significantly greater than that of esculetin. Treatment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with dietary LTO (167, 1667 or 8333 ppm) from 1 week before carcinogen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;treatment until termination had no effect on lung tumor multiplicity. The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;results of this study demonstrate that BHA is an effective inhibitor of BaP
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;plus NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice when administered during the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;period of carcinogen treatment and that, among the compounds tested,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;myo-inositol is most effective after carcinogen treatment.
