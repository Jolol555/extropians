Interesting.  Did the other 10 give any indication of why they would not
<br>
upload?  Given that the original remained intact, I am somewhat surprised
<br>
that so many would turn the offer down.

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This last week I told my microeconomics students about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some of the economics of uploading this week.  I asked
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how many of them would be willing to make an upload
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy of themselves (assuming their original remained intact).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five out of fifteen of them said they would.
