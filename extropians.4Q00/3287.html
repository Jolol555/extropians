There's No Such Thing As A Free Lunch
<br>
<p>STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden will raise the taxable value of a &quot;free&quot;
<br>
lunch by eight percent next year to 56 Swedish crowns ($5.63), the
<br>
national tax authority said on Monday.
<br>
<p>&quot;The sum of 56 crowns also applies to a free dinner. Free breakfast is
<br>
worth 28 crowns, and completely free food -- breakfast, lunch and dinner
<br>
-- is worth 140 crowns in 2001,&quot; it said in a statement.
<br>
<p>Sweden, known for womb-to-tomb welfare services, has one of the world's
<br>
highest tax rates. Many employers try to reduce the burden by giving
<br>
staff benefits such as tickets that pay for &quot;free&quot; meals in restaurants.
