<em>&gt; Feel free to elaborate on why secessionists would have more luck today.
</em><br>
<p>My two cents:
<br>
<p>Secession is usually a threat and works to get concessions.  Surely,
<br>
hardcore secessionists want out, but most people don't, so what winds up
<br>
happening is there's a compromise.  This has happened a few times in (US)
<br>
American history, the Civil War being the time an actual break happened.
<br>
<p>Of course, when one looks past the USA, we do see lots of successful
<br>
secessionist movements, such as in Eritrea (now separate from Ethipia),
<br>
Somalialand, the breakup of the Soviet Union and its allies (e.g.,
<br>
Czechoslovakia), and the balkanizing of the Balkans.  There are also lots of
<br>
very strong secessionist movements which have yet to be successful, such as
<br>
in Ingushtia (spelling?), Chechnya, the Basques in Spain, and the Northern
<br>
League in Italy.  (The last seems a lot like many pre-Civil War secessionist
<br>
movements in America, more aimed at getting concessions from the Center
<br>
(using the terminology of secessionists: the national government is usually
<br>
called the Center or the Central Government) than really breaking away -- or
<br>
that's what's happening regardless.)
<br>
<p>But history's not over yet.  Who knows what tomorrow will bring?:)
<br>
<p>What we might want to discuss is this:
<br>
<p>1)  Is secession or the threat thereof a good safety valve against
<br>
centralized power?
<br>
2)  Where would it fit in Extropian or transhumanist politics?
<br>
3)  Is it ultimately more Extropian?  (I tend to think it is, though I can
<br>
see how some might disagree.)
<br>
<p>Reasons Greetings!
