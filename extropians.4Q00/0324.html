</em><br>
<em>&gt; What you're saying implies that the vast majority soldiers are cowards,

</em><br>
<p>A large percentage, but not nearly so cowardly as those that turn tail and run.
<br>
<em>&gt;From my military experience, I found most people were not interested in combat
</em><br>
whatsoever. It has been the said that the best place to hide from a war is in
<br>
the military (if you get in early you can get a non-combat position, and only
<br>
the idiots who let themselves get drafted become cannon fodder). Leading up to
<br>
the Gulf War, I found that most of the women in my unit, married or otherwise,
<br>
were very interested in getting themselves pregnant to avoid getting sent over.
<br>
Buddies of mine in the Navy have told me of ships with large percentages of
<br>
women crewmembers causing the ship they were on being declared unfit for combat
<br>
duty because so many of the female crew had gotten pregnant and sent to shore
<br>
duty.
<br>
<p>Today's military is so bureaucratic and rule bound that it now operates to drum
<br>
out of the service the individuals who would be the best warriors. Getting
<br>
busted in a barfight is a court martial offense, for example, when it used to be
<br>
that your CPO, Gunny, or First Sergeant would bail you out and therafter count
<br>
on you for the jobs that needed doing. Officers and NCOs are more interested now
<br>
in getting their cards punched, having a clean record of no accidents, no out of
<br>
service equipment (if you don't use it, it can't wear out), and everyone in a
<br>
clean ship shape uniform, shave and a regulation haircut, so they can retire at
<br>
the highest possible rank before getting RIFFed. Actual combat is a risk to your
<br>
chances for promotion.
