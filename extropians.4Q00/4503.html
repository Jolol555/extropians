<em>&gt; Interesting.  So, we could see a situation where the programmers start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buying business suits again, because the suits are the only wearable items
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive enough - and voluminous enough - to contain decent-sized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers.  Male geeks wearing suits, female geeks wearing three layers of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 900Mhz encrypted flirting... wearable computing could have an interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect on sexual morality.
</em><br>
<p>Not to mention if someone managed to come up with a decent expert system
<br>
on flirting and the like (heaven knows there's enough domain experts out
<br>
there to codify rules that work).  Especially if it could be trained to
<br>
learn what its user really does get jollies from, as opposed to what the
<br>
user claims (and maybe honestly believes) is desired.
<br>
<p>I get a mental picture of two women in a bar.  One is reciting a
<br>
stereotypical rant about how there are no good men available.  Her
<br>
friend gets a disgusted look on her face, pulls out a small screen, and
<br>
keys up a radar-like display of all males that her systems classify as
<br>
&quot;generic good&quot; and &quot;unattached&quot; within a 50 meter radius.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are three killer apps in the mating game.  One is for stereotypical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; males, and it automatically dresses all women in bikinis or leather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catsuits, depending on taste.  The second is for stereotypical females,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it broadcasts a body image that's thirty pounds lighter than reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Needless to say, there's a large synergy between these two applications,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so they'd better be able to interoperate.)  The third is for people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't use either app, and it automatically tags other people who don't use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either app.
</em><br>
<p>It would behoove the third if the first and second communicated to it,
<br>
and this might in fact also be useful to the first two (on the premise
<br>
that those who use the third are squares whom users of the first two
<br>
probably don't want anything to do with anyway).
