<p>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
<br>
<p>CFP2001: The Eleventh Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy
<br>
<p>Hyatt Regency Cambridge
<br>
Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA
<br>
<p>March 6 - 9, 2001
<br>
<p>CALL FOR PROPOSALS
<br>
<p>The Program Committee of the Conference on Computers, Freedom, and
<br>
Privacy (CFP2001) invites your participation and proposals for the
<br>
eleventh annual CFP, which will be held at the Hyatt Regency in
<br>
Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, on March 6 - 9, 2001.
<br>
<p>CFP2001 is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
<br>
<p>CFP is the leading policy conference for exploring the impact of the
<br>
Internet, computers and communications technologies on society.  For
<br>
more than a decade, CFP has anticipated the policy trends and issues
<br>
and shaped the public debate on the future of privacy and freedom in
<br>
the online world. Each year at CFP, key members of the technical,
<br>
government, business, education, non-profit, legal, law enforcement,
<br>
security, media and hacker/cracker communities gather together to
<br>
address the cutting edge questions in computing, freedom and privacy.
<br>
CFP themes are broad and forward-looking. CFP explores what will be,
<br>
not what has been.
<br>
<p>Since this CFP will be held in 2001, the theme is the future of
<br>
computing, freedom and privacy, including the convergence of
<br>
information and communication technologies with other advanced
<br>
technology areas and the new challenges to freedom and privacy that
<br>
they engender throughout the world.  The Internet is a global
<br>
phenomenon with significant local impacts. We encourage innovative and
<br>
imaginative thinking on these topics and invite you to submit proposals
<br>
for CFP2001 conference activities.  Of particular interest are
<br>
proposals on:
<br>
<p>GOVERNANCE, including impact of the Internet on governance; impact of
<br>
governance on the Internet; ICANN; voting; standards; antitrust and
<br>
competition policy; new models for governance; and stakeholders in
<br>
governance.
<br>
<p>SOCIAL IMPACTS, such as the relationship between the individual and her
<br>
communities.
<br>
<p>INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY AND INTEGRITY, particularly human rights; freedom
<br>
of expression; censorship; free speech and access; freedom of
<br>
association; freedom of movement; and exploration of the roles of
<br>
non-identifiability, pseudonymity, and anonymity.
<br>
<p>CONVERGENCE of information and communication technologies (ICT); of ICT
<br>
and content; of ICT with other advanced technology areas, including
<br>
biotechnology, biology and materials science; and related industry
<br>
mergers, consolidations and activities.
<br>
<p>DIGITAL DIVIDE in the face of the growth of the ubiquitous information
<br>
environment; access to the network infrastructure; access to
<br>
information; broadband policy; education policy; and related
<br>
telecommunications, cable, intellectual property and freedom of
<br>
information (FOIA) rules.
<br>
<p>PRIVACY, including the growth and role of the chief privacy officer;
<br>
privacy as the default; US legislation; international developments and
<br>
trends; and an international privacy convention.
<br>
<p>INTERNATIONAL ISSUES, especially the emerging issues of global privacy
<br>
protection; international principles of human rights; security of
<br>
information systems; intellectual property; objectionable content;
<br>
cybercrime; jurisdiction; regulation; and legislation.
<br>
<p>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE, including consumer protection; and the impact of
<br>
payment systems, regulations, and technical standards on personal
<br>
freedom and privacy.
<br>
<p>We encourage proposals not only on these subjects, but also on the
<br>
border areas between these topics, such as intellectual property
<br>
protection and privacy.
<br>
<p>We strongly encourage proposals that involve leading experts,
<br>
innovators, policymakers, and thinkers.
