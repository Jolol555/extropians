<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I have often wondered if maybe there is some genetic switch, much like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;found in Swamp Eels and some frogs with the ability to change gender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;whenever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;there are too many of one gender in the population, where in human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;populations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that reach some level of social/population stress will tend to produce more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;gay/lesbian members in order to reduce population growth....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It doesn't make sense, from the point of view of an individual collection of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genes (person) to have this switch. There's no evolutionary benefit to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is best for society at large in exchange for what is best for himself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I use &quot;best&quot; here in the purely evolutionary sense). In finding a genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit, ask what is the genetic benefit for a mother or father of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offspring who are homosexual. This is the general route taken by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropologists/ psychologists, and the explanation centers around the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a childless individual is going to have more free time to do whatever,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which, in a close-knit-family type of society, this means that having a gay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child will lead to less work the other heterosexual offspring, which in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory leads to more grandchildren then if all your children were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heterosexual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess that a gay individual in a close-knit-family society will in fact be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributing to the propogation of his own genes because he shares 50% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his genes with his siblings, if this theory is correct. But I suspect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is not.. I guess it could be answered empirically by taking a survey of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gays and heterosexuals as a control group, and finding out how many nieces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and nephews each one has. Of course, the difference would have to be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then double for it to work out to the gay's evolutionary benefit.
</em><br>
<p>This would only be if evolution only cared about quantitative versus qualitative
<br>
reproduction. Hominids are not insects. I don't remember the terms describing
<br>
the two strategies of reproduction in quantity versus quality, but humans, and
<br>
all hominids (and most mammals, for that matter) lean toward gaining
<br>
evolutionary advantages via qualitative reproductive strategies, versus
<br>
quantitative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Beginning of a better theory: I've read that women who identify themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as lesbians (not bisexual, but lesbians) have actually had more sex with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more men then women who identify themselves as heterosexual. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradoxical, I don't know why it would be like this. 
</em><br>
<p>I assume it is because they kept trying different males, assuming that the
<br>
problem was in the men they were picking, before they figured out they were
<br>
lesbians. A hetero female, I think, would find satisfaction with any male sooner
<br>
than a lesbian would figure out she was lesbian, or at least accepts that she
<br>
cannot live a lie anymore. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have not read the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent stat for gay males, but I think it wouldn't surprise me to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that men who consider themselves gay have had sex with more women then have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; men who consider themselves straight, but (obviously) the number of sexual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encounters with the opposite sex would be much less. So if this were true,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the evolutionary benefit is easier to figure out, but why would it be like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this? Can anyone think of reasons why a homosexual would actually lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more heterosexual partners then a heterosexual?
</em><br>
<p>In my experience, most women I have known have had gay male freinds, and they
<br>
have typically had a fantasy about bringing them back over the fence. Many gay
<br>
people I've known tend to be at least a little bisexual, or else are bisexuals
<br>
who are living the lie of just being gay...;)
