<em>&gt; to produce lots of colonization, you also need enough variation in those

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; slower waves moving out from the same central source of variation, instead
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; much slower the next wave would be, I need better estimates of the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>At this point I'm getting a hunch that you are really talking about
<br>
artificially intelligent settlers or &quot;uploaded&quot; minds who would
<br>
reproduce strictly by copying themselves (possibly some extra speed and
<br>
efficiency there, compared to regular sexual reproduction)? Could it be
<br>
that you are thinking of these ET settlers as getting locked into an
<br>
asexual &quot;copy-me&quot; style of reproducing themselves, so that practically
<br>
all the most successful space travelers would be literally cookie-cut
<br>
from the same psychological mold, and unable to imagine that settling
<br>
down permanently would represent any sort of success? If so, what a
<br>
strange thought that would be! For instance, a leading edge &quot;asexual
<br>
wave&quot; could have passed us by, say, half a billion years ago, with a
<br>
considerably slower wave of permanent settlers not due to reach us for
<br>
many millions of years yet?
<br>
<p>In mentioning this, perhaps I'm not onto Robin Hanson's exact
<br>
&quot;wavelength&quot; even yet. It just seems really difficult to justify extreme
<br>
inflexibility of motives when describing supposedly intelligent beings,
<br>
regardless of questions of copying for &quot;reproductive&quot; success. However,
<br>
given that regular individuals *are* sometimes inflexible, if you then
<br>
imagine some especially successful kind of person--copying, well, you
<br>
know, like Keith Henson's famous &quot;explore the Galaxy to the Far Edge&quot;
<br>
scenario, maybe *then* you'd have the sort of madcap exploration wave
<br>
that we seem to be talking about here? In an ET version of this, perhaps
<br>
the explorer copies branched off into two types. Firstly, there would be
<br>
the ones who stopped in their own galaxy, then, *those* explorers would
<br>
in turn have been bypassed by the copies who decided not to stop at all
<br>
(or something like that)?
