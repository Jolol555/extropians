Hi Steve.
<br>
<p>----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &quot;Steve&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:steve@multisell.com?Subject=Re:%20greens&In-Reply-To=&lt;01d401c051c2$2de595e0$d2147318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">steve@multisell.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;1) Strip away limiting ideological garbage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The notion that you &quot;have limiting ideological garbage,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or that if you do you can &quot;strip it away,&quot; is itself part of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideological garbage.
</em><br>
<p>Um, I don't care how high you want to climb up the rope of tautology here
<br>
Steve, the point remains.  Do you think that the act of stripping away
<br>
limiting ideological garbage is itself, a limiting ideology?  If so, please
<br>
explain your position in detail so the slow kids can keep up.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;2) Understand your personal power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like boxing or wrestling ability?
</em><br>
<p>Certainly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or do you have power to hold back the waves?
</em><br>
<p>That too.  We humans are industrious little critters.  You can get
<br>
suprisingly good results from with a little bit of rebar and a pinch of
<br>
concrete.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;3) Understand your environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And all of the other environments.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  Of course, they have decreased relevancy to our existence if we don't
<br>
actually get to live in them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;4) Do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What exactly?
</em><br>
<p>Hmm... you'd like a specific directive?  Well, I was kinda hoping to keep it
<br>
opened ended... oh, you know, follow your bliss, blah bibbty blah, that sort
<br>
o' thing, but in your case I'll see if I can come up with something
<br>
concrete-- um... oh, I dunno... ah, okay, Steve, I'd like you to create a
<br>
popular sit-com based on the wacky on-screen antics of a cheeky pocket
<br>
calculator who mysteriously comes to life when accidentally dropped into a
<br>
jar of incredibly old peanut butter.  Wise-cracking technological relic,
<br>
with a real heart of gold, he undertakes to fight crime (and teach the
<br>
little ones their numbers!) living out of a basement flat in Manhattan with
<br>
a crochety (yet endearingly likeable) aged Jewish pawnbroker and a young
<br>
female cab driver with remarkable spunk.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;(What works for me: &quot;You are a human on planet Earth, and you kick ass.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There *is* a way.  Do it now.&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Others will disagree, but: reality is, after all, a game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I could have just as easily agreed with all your above points ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but even so, reality almost by definition is what &quot;isn't&quot; a game ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; games are microcosmical realities where the rules are agreed amongst the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; players.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, actually, you're right.  By its very definition, by &quot;game&quot; we usually
<br>
mean, &quot;that which -isn't- reality.&quot;  However, is there some value to be
<br>
found in treating reality as &quot;if it were&quot; a game?  I guess that depends on
<br>
how you play games, but in my case the answer is a definitive yes.  By
<br>
looking at reality as a complex rule set and attaching (necessarily)
<br>
arbitrary goals to it, and further, by seeking to optimize your success at
<br>
achieving those goals in the context of situational and environmental
<br>
modifiers, and by de-sentimentalizing your approach, and clearly weighing
<br>
costs and benefits we begin to hold reality a little bit at arms length.
<br>
<p>I kick ass at Monopoly by the way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I advise that whatever you do it tries to improve upon the &quot;human
</em><br>
condition&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; ..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although maybe the biggest game of all is that we are &quot;humans,&quot; ha! I gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretending to be human a long time ago.
</em><br>
<p>And what are you pretending to be now?
