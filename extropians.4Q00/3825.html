</em><br>
<p>Does this really follow, logically?  Why stop there?  Your labor belongs
<br>
to you, products of it belong to you, things you touch belong to you,
<br>
people who see the products of your labor belong to you, the universe
<br>
belongs to you?  Where in this chain do we overstep our bounds?  What
<br>
rule of logic tells us where to stop?
<br>
<p>Saying that you own yourself is one thing, although it's not 100% clear
<br>
what that means.  At least you are a tangible object; saying that you
<br>
&quot;thus&quot; own your labor is less well defined (labor is merely a pattern
<br>
of activity, something which is questionable to speak of owning).
<br>
<p>But to go from there and say that you own the products of your labor is
<br>
entirely unjustified, unless these products emerge directly from your body
<br>
(and I doubt that anyone will fight you over those products).
<br>
<p>In practice, to make products, you need raw materials.  And if you are
<br>
going to own those products, you better have owned the raw materials.
<br>
<p>But now your logical flow is completely disrupted.  You tried to
<br>
show how you could come to own physical objects by starting with the
<br>
logical premise that you own yourself.  However, you also have to assume
<br>
that you already owned certain physical objects (the raw materials).
<br>
Hence you have not built a system of property rights upon a foundation
<br>
of self ownership.  You had to assume owned property already.
