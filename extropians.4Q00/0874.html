<p><p>This oft repeated myth is just that, a myth.  Like many such legends,

this one has been difficult to kill.  The military shoots to kill, not

military doctrine I've seen, and it has since then been refuted by top

echelon officers in the U.S. military.  Maybe some country in Europe has

this as a doctrine (some countries, such as Sweden, have &quot;interesting&quot;
<br>
military doctrine histories that defy explanation).

<p><p>This paragraph here marks you as grossly ignorant. You haven't the
<br>
faintest idea of how these weapons are actually used by the
<br>
military. Even fully automatic (selectable fire) weapons such as the
<br>
M16 or AK47 are *virtually never* used in anything but semi-auto mode
<br>
by the military, and *never* &quot;spray-fired from the hip&quot;.  Hell, they
<br>
removed the &quot;full-auto&quot; capability from modern M16s because the
<br>
feature has almost no practical use for the military.  You've watched
<br>
*way* too many really bad Chuck Norris movies.
<br>
<p>&quot;Maximizing death and injury&quot; as you put it &quot;depend on accurate
<br>
shooting one bullet at a time&quot;, not your idiotic Hollywood notion of
<br>
how guns are used. If you pitted three hip-firing yahoos with
<br>
full-auto weapons versus one marine with a semi-auto, you would have
<br>
three dead yahoos with empty magazines every time.
<br>
<p>Despite your supposed gun owner status, you *clearly* have no
<br>
experience with military arms nor does it seem likely that you know
<br>
anything about shooting except perhaps punching paper at the local
<br>
range.  I've never seen so much inanity and grossly unjustified
<br>
opinion packed in such a small number of words.

<p><p>Function, not form is important.  Cosmetics are irrelevant.
<br>
<p>It just so happens that one of the much maligned &quot;assault weapons&quot;,
<br>
the M16/AR15, is one of the most intrinsically accurate rifle designs
<br>
ever produced.  Go to a rifle shooting match some time, look
<br>
around, and tell me what you see.  When it was first introduced (in
<br>
the '60s) a military rack M16 shooting standard ball was as accurate
<br>
as most &quot;precision&quot; weapons of the time. To this day, it is still
<br>
highly favored by precision and competition shooters, and has largely
<br>
replaced everything except custom bolt actions for anything under
<br>
600 meters.  Grandpa's lever-action will never be able to do 1/2&quot;
<br>
groups at 200 meters, but this &quot;assault weapon&quot; can.
<br>
<p>People who actually know guns appreciate many of the so-called
<br>
&quot;assault weapons&quot; for their own strengths, not because they look
<br>
&quot;evil&quot;.  An SKS is a tough and reliable shooter that is popular for
<br>
hunting because it holds up well to field use (quite popular with boar
<br>
hunters in particular, probably for that quick follow-up). The AR15 is
<br>
the gold-standard for ergonomic design and its extreme precision makes
<br>
it popular for target shooters and varmint hunters. These are all
<br>
clearly reasonable civilian uses for which the weapons are
<br>
particularly well-suited.
<br>
<p>As for bayonet lugs, when was the last time anyone was murdered with a
<br>
bayonet (outside government sponsored action, of course)?  Or
<br>
silencers (hint: none)?  Barrel shrouds don't even have a function on
<br>
anything a person can carry, other than to look cool. Flash suppressors
<br>
don't do anything that has any applicability to criminal use (if you think
<br>
it does, you don't know what a flash suppressor is for) and falls under the
<br>
same category as barrel shrouds. Folding/collapsible stocks are good for
<br>
paratroopers and small statured people that can't use a rifle that has a
<br>
regular stock because of length-of-pull issues.
<br>
<p>(And I was trying to ignore these gun threads...)
<br>
<p>It is well-intentioned and poorly educated people like yourself Mr.
<br>
Dees, that pave the road to hell.  It is too bad you can't see that,
<br>
but then those people rarely do.
