Subject: Re: MVT: all-conquering philosophy?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; OK. I also think that language is faulty and misleading in general,
<br>
S&gt; which I why I am starting to develop a word-free visual philosophy
<br>
S&gt; (some examples at www.extropia.net vis phil sector).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Being visual is not enough.
</em><br>
<p>Nor is being wordy .....  but philosophy does not allow itself
<br>
to use pictures, but in my approach I can use any symbolic forms.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;All the ordinary philosophical problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be translated into, for example, American Sign Language, with only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a few complications.  After all, writing is visual.  The difference is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in how much formal structure your language has, and how much is left
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be inferred from humanity and charity.  On the formal end, you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;got the propositional calculus and Lojban.  On the informal end,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you've got abstract dance, jazz,
</em><br>
<p>Purely visual &amp; auditory surely ... we use our musical judgements not
<br>
verbal ....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;painting, and others.  In the middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;towards the formal end you've got speech; ASL is a little less formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than speech, and more dependent on &quot;context&quot; (ie charity and humanity)
</em><br>
<p>But I allow myself all the mediums ... so my analysis is more complete
<br>
than one limited to linguistic analysis...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Philosophical analysis is something worth doing; if philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issues don't appear at all in some more-informal visual language, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that just tells me that you can't do philosophy in that language.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;translating problems into a certain language makes a certain answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appear obvious, then that may be a compelling argument for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;answer, as we currently take to be the case with the propositional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calculus.  But just as you can't have an analytic discussion about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind in the language of jazz, (no, you can't, [no, you can't,])
</em><br>
<p>But you can't have an analytic discussion about mind if you
<br>
are a physicalist either ... and maybe you can have a purely
<br>
diagrammatic discussion about the mind using pictures ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't mean that we should stop playing/listening to jazz or stop
</em><br>
having analytic discussions about the metaphysics of mind.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Yes, a shorter or more elegant proof in maths is better than one
<br>
S&gt; using more terms. I claim MVT is the simplest and most elegant
<br>
S&gt; account. MVT also explains more phenomena, and reduces several
<br>
S&gt; other theories in science (and philosophy) to a more basic account.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;On philosophical grounds, then, I say that MVT doesn't seem very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elegant to me; that it doesn't even seem to be right on philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terms, on account of the qualitative differences between &quot;holes&quot; (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;missing functionality) and feelings.
</em><br>
<p>Forget &quot;holes&quot; .. this was one of my arguments about your atomism.
<br>
Substitute &quot;abstract&quot; or &quot;absent&quot; .. and consider that &quot;symbols&quot; are the
<br>
medium of all types of mentation and that the pineal unitary sense organ
<br>
has become symbolic rather than actual.
<br>
<p>Or does your type of physicalism deny symbols?
<br>
<p>S&gt; Are &quot;principles&quot; physical then? Otherwise your determinist position
<br>
S&gt; starts to come apart ... What about &quot;desires&quot; ... didn't you say that
<br>
S&gt; our beliefs only come from desires (or was it vice-versa)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We change parts of our programming from time to time, but when we do,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we follow a metaprogram.  Metaprograms change from time to time, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when they do, it happens under a metametaprogram.  And so on.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Determinism doesn't rule out the possibility of history any more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it demands fatalism; all I've described here is a bit of history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science.
</em><br>
<p>I repeat my question: &quot;Are &quot;principles&quot; physical then? &quot;
<br>
<p>I don't think you are using &quot;metaprogram&quot; in the accepted
<br>
psychotherapeutic sense here, but are changing the idea to try
<br>
and fit with your philosophical bias. Brains can not only change
<br>
their &quot;programming&quot; but can reconfigure their own *hardware*
<br>
<p>S&gt; That may be true if words are your ONLY medium of communication.
<br>
S&gt; The &quot;questioning&quot; idea might not be problematic if we commune using
<br>
S&gt; touch signals, or visual display predominantly. &quot;Questioning&quot; might
<br>
S&gt; translate to a &quot;feeling of puzzlement&quot; of a particular grain. I might
<br>
S&gt; want to say that we can rely on and trust our *feelings* (that MVT
<br>
S&gt; is the true account) more than lots of us currently do. Or I might
<br>
S&gt; appeal to pattern completion and recognition, and suggest that our
<br>
S&gt; judgement be based on a satisfactory visualisation of the matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, but I don't share those feelings with you.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, so you adopt an *Intuitionist * stance here .. your words have
<br>
given out so you appeal to feelings. I happen to think most
<br>
philosophical so-called analysis does come down to feelings
<br>
and aesthetics ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Yes, but we must be careful not to overload the term &quot;psychological.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Feelings are psychological, and so are &quot;holes,&quot; but they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;psychological in very different ways.  Sadness, for example, has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;physical place at all, by virtue of its purely mental character.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; I don't disagree with this. We have infinite-state potential to
<br>
experience
<br>
S&gt; any feeling imaginable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not sure what your response had to do with my original claim.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just meant that feelings have no location.  Finite-state and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infinite-state doesn't seem to enter into that question.
</em><br>
<p>I wanted to draw attention that you do think that &quot;holes&quot; are
<br>
&quot;psychological&quot; .... not physical ..... again supporting an idealist
<br>
account rather than your denial of consciousness. The infinite-state
<br>
is possible only because part of the (whole-part fusion) is absent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And being infinite-state certainly isn't an INTUITION I have.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would it feel like to be very-many-state?  Would that feel differently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from being infinite-state?
</em><br>
<p>It is an idea .....
<br>
And yes, I do think that the symbolic sensor/ phantom component
<br>
is true infinite-state in a way that an analog infinite state CRT is not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You might say &quot;it doesn't feel like anything to be finite-state,&quot; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I certainly don't see why *that* has to be true.  Why couldn't you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have one-state or two-state illusions?  Why not twenty?  Or twenty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;million?  Why only infinite?
</em><br>
<p>But I think it does feel like something ... like what we experience
<br>
in fact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Can you imagine checking on this, even internally?  You'd have one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imagining after another, again and again, until... what?  You halted?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Until you didn't halt?  Until you gave up?
</em><br>
<p>No, that would be boring. I leave such nonsense thought experiments
<br>
to academic philosophers ...... what is the point you are making?
<br>
<p><p>S&gt; Let me understand this correctly ... you claim that &quot;space&quot; or &quot;void&quot;
<br>
S&gt; is physical ... although it just has location and not any matter/
<br>
physical
<br>
S&gt; stuff? I think &quot;location&quot; is a dimension, much like &quot;time&quot; .. and as such
<br>
S&gt; isn't necessarily (or maybe isn't either probably, or even *possibly*)
<br>
S&gt; physical. Matter, time and space are assigned as different variants
<br>
S&gt; in physics  ... so can  these things be identical?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't follow you.  I'd never said that matter, time and space are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identical.
</em><br>
<p>No, never said you did, was asking you this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I do think that they're all physical; that they share
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that one property in common.
</em><br>
<p>Time is the *measurement* of movement in space .. therefore
<br>
must be subjective because measurement is integral, not
<br>
incidental to the concept of time. There is no &quot;time&quot; out there
<br>
that you can point to  ... it is just a concept ... not physical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I take it that the correct move in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phenomenological scenario is to be an anti-realist about physics: to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say &quot;when you say matter, you really mean such-and-such matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;qualia...&quot; or &quot;when you say physical, you really mean having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such-and-such sensations in common...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I won't use the qualia jargon, but yes, I largely agree with the above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Anyway, the very fact that &quot;holes&quot; have a &quot;location&quot; by definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whereas &quot;feelings&quot; don't, is enough to show that &quot;holes&quot; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analytically different from &quot;feelings,&quot; whatever other properties
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these things have.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, except that the only knowledge you have of the hole is
<br>
indirect, via your feelings/ perceptions/ logical reasoning and
<br>
depth perception &amp;c. The illusion of the hole has an illusionary
<br>
location .. there isn't any &quot;hole&quot; independent of the illusion, or
<br>
if there is it is impossible to know. Same with any so-called
<br>
&quot;physical objects&quot; .. but MVT idealism explains how the illusion
<br>
is produced. I don't need to deny the existence of physical objects,
<br>
maybe they are there, or maybe we hallucinate them, who knows
<br>
and who cares. The physical brain is necessary, but not sufficient
<br>
for consciousness. A self-referential  and abstract component is
<br>
needed in order to interact with the world of symbols &amp; abstraction.
<br>
<p>S&gt; I include &quot;possibly&quot; because of the possible that all is mental, and
<br>
S&gt; space, physical stuff, atoms and all the rest of it are just
<br>
S&gt; concepts combined with conscious perceptions (real virtuality in
<br>
S&gt; MVT-terms) plus self-generated imagination.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Again, this doesn't bother me.  Even in a virtual reality, you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wonder how your sensations-of-brains are connected to other minds.
</em><br>
<p>S&gt; Anyway, you are not consistent saying that &quot;we use our minds to
<br>
S&gt; demarcate&quot; if your system does not include &quot;minds&quot; ... conscious
<br>
S&gt; organs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We anti-realists get this a lot.  It's completely fallacious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Anti-realists about Xs assert that there aren't really Xs, AND that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should reinterpret claims about Xs to be claims about Ys.  So when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somebody says &quot;The anti-realist contradicts himself when he says
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such-and-such about Xs, yet maintains that there are no Xs!&quot; they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making a flat-out mistake.  It is not wrong to talk about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness or pain or other feelings; all I ask is that we remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that these are handy terms for physical phenomena.
</em><br>
<p>I don't accept that &quot;consciousness&quot; is a handy term for a physical
<br>
phenomena at all .. and have an example that might prove my case.
<br>
With chemical medicine you can establish causal links between
<br>
relief of symptoms or cure of illness and the physical properties of
<br>
a drug.
<br>
<p>However, all experiments ever done on the subject have shown
<br>
that a &quot;placebo effect&quot; operates .... but the sugar pill has no
<br>
chemical effects in the cure, only psychological.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The way to avoid this mistake is to remember that it is *very* rare
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that an intelligent person will assert an outright contradiction,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;especially an intelligent philosopher; they're probably saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something else similar.
</em><br>
<p>Disagree. The wisest men in history have made glaring errors
<br>
and believed crass theories. Especially philosophers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In this case, I could have said that &quot;holes are psychological only in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we use our BRAINS to demarcate their boundaries&quot; without any loss
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of meaning.  Indeed, I obviously should have said this: it would have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clearer to you.
</em><br>
<p>But holes have no &quot;substance&quot; and are JUST their boundaries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But forgive me if I slip back into such handy phrases as &quot;Imagine that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...&quot; &quot;I feel differently ...&quot; or &quot;... they both feel the same.&quot;  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being an anti-realist about these phrases.  We both get to say them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but we get to say them for different reasons.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but when I say them I mean what I say, and when you say them
<br>
they are packed  together with a unwieldy bunch of provisos &amp;c. in
<br>
that you should really qualify each statement before using it.
<br>
<p>S&gt; Yes, so are there some truth or empirical grounds which reinforce
<br>
S&gt; even the hypnosis, or make the hypnosis easier to take if experience
<br>
S&gt; is in agreement?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, it doesn't matter to me whether there's a &quot;truth&quot; or not.  I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;go about acting like my intuitions are pretty well (but not perfectly)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in touch with it, either way.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we accept and use the phantom pineal eye because the brain is
<br>
fooled (or addicted) into receiving inputs and generating outputs as
<br>
though the thing was still physical and functional.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'd assume that hypnosis is harder to the extent that it disagrees with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my currently active beliefs/desires, but that there's nothing else
</em><br>
<em>&gt;helping or hindering the matter.  Hypnotizing me to believe the truth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when I strongly believe a falsehood should be no harder than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypnotizing me to believe a falsehood when I believe the truth, all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;else being equal (which it so rarely is).
</em><br>
<p>There is less work for the hypnotist .. but yes, works either case.
<br>
The point I am making is for the primacy of the mental/ conscious.
<br>
If I suggested to you under somnambulistic trance that I was burning
<br>
a cigarette stub on your hand, not only would you experience it,
<br>
but might well manifest burn marks! (See placebo effect argument).
<br>
<p>S&gt; And given that we could already be in trance or working on
<br>
S&gt; post-hypnotic suggestions, how do you make any truth claims for your
<br>
S&gt; own beliefs in determinism, epiphenobblyism and all that Turing
<br>
S&gt; machine rubbish?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I make truth claims because I'm following my intuitions, and my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;program.
</em><br>
<p>Where is this program located? Or do you just mean cultural
<br>
conditioning and things you have learnt or been told?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Do I make justified truth claims?  I think I do, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has to be pretty much good enough for me.
</em><br>
<p>Are you conscious of making these justified truth claims?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; S&gt; No Turing machines of the sort you discuss have ever, not will ever,be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; built.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;.Perhaps not, but only on account of their being too cumbersome, slow,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;expensive, and hard to build, not by virtue of their being different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in principle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; Yes, or in other words the idea of building them is daft! So why would
<br>
S&gt; evolution (infinitely pragmatic) have used such a daft design?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Nobody's arguing that nature has actually designed a tape-reader, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the human brain has any tape.  But nature might be stuck using a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;million tape-reader-equivalents instead of something better because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Turing machine equivalents (the collection of which, in turn, is one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;big Turing machine equivalent) are all that are physically available.
</em><br>
<p>You are wrong in fact here ... neurons are mini-transputers, more like
<br>
transistors than Turing machine heads. And they flock together to work
<br>
on particular problems. Talk of Turing machines is positively misleading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; S&gt; The SHAPE of the brain effects its function, the shape evolved, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; (gestalt) can be described in terms of foreground OR background
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S&gt; (holes), or both.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But holes are different from sadness; different in kind and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;principle.  They may be linked, but they're not the same.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
S&gt; No, you continue to misunderstand that &quot;holes&quot; are an analogy that I
<br>
S&gt; use to point out some shared attributes with the &quot;absent&quot; or
<br>
S&gt; &quot;abstract&quot; pineal eye .... but I by no means hold that this analogy
<br>
S&gt; is the whole story.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sure, I see where you're going here.  To say that something is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;missing a certain function&quot; is just to state counterfactually that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if you had a pineal eye, you'd act in such-and-such a way.  It is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;describe a certain possible state-of-affairs in which you had a pineal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eye, and you acted that way.  But that &quot;possible state-of-affairs&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just an idea, a non-physical if not purely mental object.  So &quot;missing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functions&quot; are psychological just like possibilities are.
</em><br>
<p>Not &quot;just an idea&quot; ... but a pervasive felt experience ... like phantom
<br>
vision or tinnitus are not &quot;ideas&quot; or indivual concepts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why this little parable about functionalism?  Because your view, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being conscious just is to miss the functionality of the pineal eye,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and nothing more, amounts to a kind of anti-functionalism: it is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say that being conscious means to have a MISSING physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functionality, rather than a present physical functionality, as Putnam
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had argued.  It's a modal property of a physical object either way.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;It is necessary for the brain to construct the impression of the
<br>
old median eye in order to integrate all the sense-data with
<br>
hormonal responses .. the original pineal eye carried out hormonal
<br>
functions that have had to be replaced ... as well as missing
<br>
information about the world that now has to be modelled or assumed.
<br>
The phantom pineal eye is a perceptual phantom as well as a
<br>
phantom of the physical component.
<br>
<p>Consciousness is centrally evoked ... and this is not to say:
<br>
&quot;being conscious just is to miss the functionality of the pineal eye,
<br>
and nothing more&quot; because I readily accept that we are conscious
<br>
of many other facts, and that e-2 animals and insects might
<br>
have teleological experience ... but it is a necessary component
<br>
to explain symbolic and self-referential consciousness (dreams
<br>
and the narrative self &amp;c).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Your anti-functionalist view suffers from all the same problems as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functionalism; all the same objections.  Maybe it has all the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intuitive support.  Certainly it's worth noting that missing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pineal-eye functionality seems to cause positive physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functionality like the kind Putnam was interested in.  That's what led
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us to conclude that the pineal eye was interesting: missing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical functionality seemed to grant us another functionality:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent behavior.  But we can't really use this as a solution for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the mind/body problem, or even as intuitive support for a solution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because you'd just be arguing for functionalism: you'd be using
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functionalism to argue that you'd solved the mind/body problem.
</em><br>
<p>I accept some of this ... but still feel it is worth exploring which types
<br>
of
<br>
problems can be cleared up by MVT .. and even if it provides a
<br>
better analogy than existing ones, this is of value. I do think it
<br>
answers the Leibnitz Law objection to Descartes, and on this
<br>
(the original formulation of the mind-body problem) point I do think it
<br>
overcomes Leibnitz objection .... which was that the pineal GLAND,
<br>
or any other physical part of the brain by extension, cannot interact
<br>
with &quot;psychological&quot; events which are not physical.
<br>
<p>The abstract, phantom pineal eye is not physical in the same way that
<br>
the pineal gland is physical: thus it could interact ....
<br>
<p>What I want to do is go from &quot;could&quot; to *does* ... and this is tricky.
<br>
<p>S&gt; I will reciprocally agree with a weaker version of determinism: after
<br>
S&gt; all we cannot step outside this Universe (at least very easily!) and I
<br>
S&gt; accept that we do not have free will in all things. Perhaps by combining
<br>
S&gt; these weaker versions we can stop this tired old Free Will debate?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Probably not, so long as philosophers assert that we CAN make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decisions wholly independent from how we were last week or laster
</em><br>
<em>&gt;year, and so long as philosophers argue that the difference between us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a million Turing machines (or one big fast one) is that one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free-willed and the other is not.
</em><br>
<p>But the differences are so obvious I do not think you can
<br>
sustain this Turing argument for long .....
<br>
<p>S&gt; The von Neumann and Turing analogies as to how a brain works
<br>
S&gt; are of as much use and out of date as the 1920's analogies between
<br>
S&gt; the brain and a telephone exchange.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Because the Turing-Church thesis tells us of what we human beings are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capable (namely, nothing more than of what a bunch of Turing machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are capable, and therefore nothing more than of what one great big
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fast Turing machine is capable) and what can possibly act like us.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are making an unjustified leap to conclusion here. An
<br>
malefic demon is capable of acting exactly like us, or maybe
<br>
if we had your fairy physics that could explain everything ... but in
<br>
fact what we have are brains that are massively parallel distributed
<br>
systems, and not any of the other things. We have the solution already,
<br>
so why do philosophers continue to look for worse solutions?
<br>
<p>S&gt; This isn't a case of just &quot;equivalent but slower&quot; .... they would also be
<br>
S&gt; working in a completely different way from you. Neural computers
<br>
S&gt; are reverse engineered from brain circuits, so are a lot more
<br>
S&gt; convincing ... this ISN'T just an aesthetic matter either ... the neural
<br>
S&gt; computational model of the brain is BETTER than the older serial
<br>
S&gt; computational models ... sure a load of sluggard academics still use it
<br>
S&gt; but they are due for reduction by MVT pretty soon, I hope.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But the fact that they'd do the same things at the end of a very long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;day, I insist, IS interesting.
</em><br>
<p>I can't deny it is interesting to you ...... but certainly isn't to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;They WOULD behave the same way, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one would do so much much slower (but that's all).
</em><br>
<p>NO ... I won't allow this. Turing machines do not reconfigure their
<br>
circuitry, they do not compute in parallel, and I do not think it
<br>
possible for them to be instantiated biologically ...
<br>
<p>Furthermore, and the key point, they aren't CONSCIOUS but
<br>
we are ... our neural wetware is capable of manifesting non-physical
<br>
components and the associated phantom illusions ... do you claim
<br>
that Turing machines could have, then lose but remember, a pineal
<br>
eye (or any other body part come to that). I think not.
