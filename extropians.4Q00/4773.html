<em>&gt; So, the genes that provide a body for a sport phenotype might allow a
</em><br>
person with
<br>
<em>&gt; the most scientifically tuned and efficient body for windsurfing, for
</em><br>
example.
<br>
<em>&gt; Will the person make a good windsurfer?  Take twenty random people and
</em><br>
train them
<br>
<em>&gt; for five years to be windsurfers.  Will any be?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I had a good friend in highschool who was an uber-jock. He was selected in
<br>
college (equivalent of US senior high), by the Australian Institute of Sport
<br>
for a rowing team, based solely on physique - he was built like the perfect
<br>
rower. This was an experimental method for the institute; they went to
<br>
schools and found kids who were right for rowing, even though they had no
<br>
rowing experience.
<br>
<p>It was a mixed success. There was a women's team and a men's team. The
<br>
women's team won lots of medals and did very well, and the men's team was
<br>
mostly fairly mediocre; as I remember, there were personality clashes
<br>
between the men's coach and the rowers.
<br>
<p>I think this method is now being used more widely, however.
