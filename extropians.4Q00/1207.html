<p>Have you checked out Ohio State University?  Not that you would really want
<br>
to go here, but it really is a top-notch research institute, which does a
<br>
little teaching on the side.  I'm majoring in Neuroscience (had to twist
<br>
their arms to get them to let me do that, not an &quot;established&quot; major)  and
<br>
working for a great lab under Drs. Sarter and Bruno
<br>
(<a href="http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/bruno/">http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/bruno/</a>), doing studies on the acetylcholine
<br>
projections from the nucleus basalis of Meynert to the pre-frontal cortex.
<br>
It has major implications in normal aging and alzheimer's disease.  I don't
<br>
know what you're specifically interested in, but it is a nifty little field.
<br>
I'm especially excited about my involvement now, because we're getting a
<br>
brand-spanking new voltametry set-up, and I get to play with it.  We
<br>
normally do microdialysis studies of neurochemical correlates of attention
<br>
behaviors in performing rats, but with the new equipment we'll increase our
<br>
resolution from 5 minutes to nano-seconds.  We hope to see some interesting
<br>
data.  We're part of The Center for Sensor Technology, based in the
<br>
university of Kentucky.  (<a href="http://censet.uky.edu/">http://censet.uky.edu/</a>).
<br>
<p>Happy hunting, and thanks for making me feel better about bombing my
<br>
physical chemistry midterm today.  Smart people have trouble with college,
<br>
too!
