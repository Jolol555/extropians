</em><br>
<p>Imagine three bell-shaped, partly overlapping curves. Wavelength
<br>
vs. how much photons of this kind excites the receptor. The tails
<br>
decay rather slowly, so you should be able to see some NIR or UV,
<br>
given enough intensity (nevermind that enough intensity will damage
<br>
the eye, but at least for a while you can enjoy a radically expanded
<br>
experience ;) In fact some (imo rather foolish) people have purported
<br>
to see a very dim red when looking into an operating NIR laser diode
<br>
(don't do it at home, kids), at least for a while. I'm told an UV LED
<br>
(also not healthy to look into) also projects a sort of sickly
<br>
purplish glow (and making mineral-filler paper fluoresce), probably
<br>
combining the effects of emission and receptivity bell curves
<br>
tails. Additionally, some of the UV is being cut off by the cornea, so
<br>
some people with surgically removed cornea reported a wider
<br>
sensitivity to the blue region of the spectrum. (That sunrise is sooo
<br>
ultraviolet... wow, man). But that's irrelevant for our current
<br>
discussion, since we we will consider the eye as an integrated,
<br>
unhackable sensor.
<br>
<p>Let's take just one of the bell-shaped curves for simplicity. There
<br>
are (rather expensive) colour filters based on interference effects
<br>
(think of it as hitech versions of butterfly's wings) out there, which
<br>
allow you to cut out a relatively narrow spectral window. If you put
<br>
such an interference filter which cuts out an area from within a given
<br>
photoreceptor's sensitivity/wavelength curve, you've changed the shape
<br>
of the total sensitivity/wavelenght curve, especially if it's
<br>
off-center (of the original sensitivity maximum). Of course, this
<br>
comes for a price: less light comes through in toto, and hence the
<br>
total sensitivity is degraded. You should be able to resolve more
<br>
colours when comparing a light source while with and without the
<br>
filter. In theory, you could use a filter function which smoothly
<br>
changes over time (moving a narrow window over your bell-shaped
<br>
curve), giving you a kind of time-multiplexed multispectral
<br>
vision. You would perceive that as an object smoothly changing hue,
<br>
highlighting some areas which you wouldn't be ordinarily able to
<br>
resolve. But the visual system is lousy at temporal comparisons, so
<br>
you try to put the other eye (or other part of the retina) to the
<br>
task. Another way to see more colours would be by misusing a
<br>
diffraction grating mirror as part of the optical system. You'd be
<br>
mapping photons usually converging on the same spot of the retina to
<br>
diverse nearby. Every object would acquire a multispectral halo in one
<br>
dimension. For instance, it is trivial to distinguish incandescents
<br>
and fluorescents using a common CD as a makeshift diffraction grating,
<br>
if you can't lay your hands on a real diffraction grating (which are
<br>
speciality items, and hence expensive. You might fish around in the
<br>
trash bin of your local research institute, and salvage one from an
<br>
old spectrophotometer, or something. Or order one from Edmund Optics,
<br>
if you're feeling particularly enterprising).
<br>
<p>Of course, a true tetrachromate experience is much superior, since the
<br>
visual pathways have had time to adapt and remap themselves to utilize
<br>
to a colourspace with one extra dimension. The (minor) negative side
<br>
effect is that your colour resolution is even worse than before
<br>
(because the different cell types can't occupy the same place, notice
<br>
that this doesn't affect the cell type which is sensitive to the
<br>
entire VIS range, and which is responsible for high-lateral resolution
<br>
high-sensitivity -- this stuff is more important than color). And, of
<br>
course, you're likely to break the colour vision of your male
<br>
offspring. Yikes.
<br>
<p>It would be cool if the retinal cell could modulate it's spectral
<br>
sensitivity rapidly, and the visual system could integrate the
<br>
information. But I guess we will have to wait for postbiology for
<br>
that. 
<br>
<p>Right now the best you can do is by using a multispectral imager with
<br>
a HMD/head-up, and (adaptively) map the colours into the common RGB
<br>
scheme, seeing the world in (changing, tunable) false colours. I
<br>
haven't heard of any gargoyles with such a hookup, apart from the
<br>
obvious (mapping NIR into VIS, using NIR filters and NIR light sources
<br>
(but the sun is pretty bright in NIR, too -- the NIR LED cluster lamp
<br>
plus CCD and/or MCP residual light amplifier is great for nightly
<br>
sneaking around, and doing all kinds of technology-assisted practical
<br>
jokes, etc.)).
<br>
<p>Say, that's a rather large soapbox.
