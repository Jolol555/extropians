<p><em>&gt; Right, so parents who add enhancement genes to their children might want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to add an enhancement gene that enables the children to see the folly of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suing the parents for a paltry settlement instead of using their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancements intelligently.
</em><br>
<p>While it might be hard to achieve genetically (overdeveloped familial
<br>
bonding systems and enhanced conflict aversiveness?) it is certainly a
<br>
emotional and memetic factor. Just look at how much people put up with
<br>
their parents (and vice versa!) today, even when there would be ample
<br>
reason to go away or even sue them. Clearly, people would not sue
<br>
their parents to the same extent as they would sue non-related people.
<br>
<p>As I see it, we want to set up a system that supports the germline
<br>
engineering of traits that people later find useful but minimises the
<br>
engineering of traits experienced as confining without having to rely
<br>
on somebody setting global rules (which will not fit all people and
<br>
may impose bad values). The insurance-litigation system might be a
<br>
first approximation to this, but as this shows the idea needs some
<br>
development in order to work. I guess that if the main &quot;regulating&quot;
<br>
feature would be the pre-conception genetic insurance parents took
<br>
against future litigation from their offspring rather than the
<br>
litigation itself, then the bias against suing parents would become
<br>
less relevant and the differentiation between different changes could
<br>
still be retained.
