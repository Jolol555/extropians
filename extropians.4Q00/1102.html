A very interesting report (500 pages) about Forest Resources
<br>
was published, by UNECE, at
<br>
<a href="http://www.unece.org/trade/timber/fra/tbfra-ad.htm">http://www.unece.org/trade/timber/fra/tbfra-ad.htm</a>

<p>DEFOLIATION
<br>
Information on defoliation as an indicator of the extent
<br>
of tree damage from one or a combination of causes,
<br>
including air pollution, is provided. The indicators used
<br>
are the percentages of trees of different defoliation
<br>
classes for each year between 1986 and 1997, divided
<br>
into equal to or less than 25 per cent and more than
<br>
25 per cent defoliation for all species, coniferous species
<br>
and broadleaved species. The use of defoliation as an
<br>
indicator of forest health has been the subject of intensive
<br>
debate. The definition of defoliation, as adopted by the
<br>
UN/ECE is needle or leaf loss in the assessable crown as
<br>
compared to a reference tree. There is evidence of some
<br>
trends in individual countries, these should be treated with
<br>
great caution. A comparison of the years 1992 and 1998
<br>
reveals that there are more plots in Europe (31.2 per cent)
<br>
where mean crown condition deteriorated than plots where
<br>
there was a significant improvement (15.4 per cent).
<br>
Deteriorating plots are spread all over Europe, with an
<br>
accumulation in the west (France) and south (mainly Italy).
<br>
Plots with a significant recuperation are clustered in the
<br>
so-called sub-Atlantic region, which mainly comprises Germany
<br>
and Poland. In-depth evaluations show that in all other regions
<br>
a slight deterioration took place during the last seven years.
<br>
Mean crown condition remained on the same level only in the
<br>
boreal region (mainly covering Scandinavia).
<br>
<p>POLLUTION DAMAGES
<br>
The greatest levels of damage were reported in south-eastern
<br>
Europe, with 11,900 ha in Albania, 7,000 ha in Austria,
<br>
18,000 ha in the Czech Republic, 66,900 ha in Romania,
<br>
64,900 ha in Yugoslavia. A further 12,000 ha of damage was
<br>
reported from the USA. In relation to the forest area,
<br>
Liechtenstein had the highest proportion of forest damaged by
<br>
local pollution sources (4.05 per cent), followed by Yugoslavia
<br>
(1.86 per cent), Albania (1.15 per cent), Romania (1 per cent)
<br>
and the Czech Republic (0.68 per cent). In all other countries
<br>
reporting this form of damage, the area affected was less
<br>
than 0.5 per cent. 
<br>
<p>CONCLUSIONS
<br>
The reported figures indicate that defoliation is much more
<br>
widespread in Europe than in North America. In the USA
<br>
the proportions of trees with more than 25 per cent defoliation
<br>
is generally less than 1 per cent. In Canada, it is generally less
<br>
than 10 per cent, whereas in Europe in recent years, it has been
<br>
more than 20 per cent. This almost certainly reflects differences
<br>
in standards between Europe and North America. The european
<br>
figures reflect a trend for increasing defoliation. The proportion
<br>
of trees assessed every year between 1988 and 1997 with more
<br>
than 25 per cent defoliation has increased from 13.2 per cent in
<br>
1988 to 23.1 per cent in 1997. No information is available on the
<br>
cause of this reported increase in defoliation.
