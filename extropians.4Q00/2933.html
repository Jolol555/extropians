Here is a philosophical puzzle somewhat similar to the question of
<br>
germ-line modification.
<br>
<p>Suppose at some point we got a good cellular model of brain cells and
<br>
how they grow and develop, but we didn't have good sensing technology so
<br>
that we could take a brain apart and extract all the information encoded
<br>
in its structure and functionality.  Then, suppose it were possible to
<br>
scan an embryonic brain, because it is smaller and simpler, and has less
<br>
learned information.  In this hypothetical, the first upload could be
<br>
an unborn child.
<br>
<p>The embryo would be destructively scanned and then its growth modeled.
<br>
It would undergo fetal development and then a simulated birth.  At that
<br>
point it would live in a VR environment and be provided with care and
<br>
human interaction through some kind of virtual interface.
<br>
<p>Would this be good or bad for the child?  On the one hand, as Robin Hanson
<br>
has argued, the first uploads could be in a tremendously advantageous
<br>
position.  On the other hand, the experiment is uncertain and the quality
<br>
of life for the child might be poor.  He might even become a slave.
<br>
He might thank you for what you have done, or he might hate you (or he
<br>
might do both, in different copies).  And of course there is no prospect
<br>
of getting his consent ahead of time.
<br>
<p>If you had the opportunity to have your unborn child be the subject
<br>
of this experiment, would you?  What philosophical principles would
<br>
guide you?
<br>
