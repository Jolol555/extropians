</em><br>
<em>&gt; I opened up my ZIA multimedia from 1994 to read an older verion of the Extropian Principles, because I thought that the new ones looked much much different than I had remembered.  All of these years I was chanting mostly number 1, 3, and 5 of the 2.5 version, that I had engraved in memory. Now I feel like a fool that they hardly exist anymore.

<em>&gt; I suppose I shouldn't complain too much, since I haven't been around for the &quot;PERPETUAL PROGRESS&quot; you have made here.  But these principles sound much more practical and politically correct and less dynamic than they used to.  Perhaps I should try to be more of a &quot;PRACTICAL OPTIMIST&quot; and not so much the &quot;DYNAMIC OPTIMIST&quot; I have chosen to be all these years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; But I WON'T!  By golly, I am a &quot;DYNAMIC optimist&quot;!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PRACTICAL optimism is not going to get us into space, and that is the focus of my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am sure these principles have been subtly morphing over the years, and I do not wish to haggle over them, personally.  I just urge you all to re-read this older version which I have made a part of my life for several years now.  I find them easy to remember and to chant, and straight and to the point, without sounding too politically correct or too touchy-feely.  They are short and to the point, and have enough GRIT.

<p>Elaine,
<br>
I know what you mean. I myself have been stuck, apparently and happily
<br>
hopelessly, in a v2.5 mode. I just can't accept the PC mamby pambyness of a few
<br>
of the changes in the 3.0 principles. 'Practical' is for politicians and porch
<br>
sitters, IMHO, NOT for pioneers. I don't mind the Open Society and Self
<br>
Direction parts much though, and they are most decidedly not PC in today's world
<br>
of community, animal, and other 'rights' that are merely spin agitprop used to
<br>
strip the individual of his or her rights. 'Perpetual Progress': Who decides
<br>
what this means?  So called 'progressives' are almost uniformly of a communalist
<br>
nature, and claim the day of the individual is over (a claim that was obsolete
<br>
in 1945, and reiterated in 1990), that the concept of the courageous pioneer
<br>
breaking a path into the unknown and putting untapped resources to good
<br>
technological use is simply an illusion of the sexist imperialist capitalist
<br>
running dog patriarchal society justifying its crimes against nature. Perpetual
<br>
Progress, in today's world, is almost the direct opposite of Boundless
<br>
Expansion.
<br>
