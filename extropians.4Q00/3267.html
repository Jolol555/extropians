<p><em>&gt;&gt; Rarely, however, do we make the connection between what is happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outwardly and the inner domain of our own psyche. We don't seem to realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, in the total scheme of things, it is we who have brought about this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation: it is our strong notions of separate identity, our labeling of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others as evil &amp; wrong-headed, our inability to see ourselves clearly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This, surely, is the starting-point. For, about other people I can do very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little, but I can do something about myself, since the conflict all around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me has been generated by the same division that exists within me.
</em><br>
<p>The notion that what is outward reflects internal psychological
<br>
conditions is quite ancient and also quite unsupported.  At the least
<br>
the &quot;Maharishi effect&quot; should work if there is a strong link.  But it
<br>
does not.  It is not we, not me personally, who has caused the
<br>
Afghanistan ruling clique to go hyper-Moslem-fundie and utterly oppress
<br>
and murder its women.  It is not I who get to choose for all of those
<br>
who believe something highly irrational and suffer the consequences when
<br>
reality turns out not to be as they thought it.  
<br>
<p>It seems these conferences are more about rewiring our identity along
<br>
old lines that have never seemed to have major power to change the
<br>
living conditions of a people.  They attempt to entice to old ways by
<br>
using spurious claims of the inward causing the outward.  God, I wish it
<br>
was that simple. 
<br>
<p>Sometimes some of us do make quite evil (in terms of what is the good
<br>
for us &lt;inclusive&gt;) and wrong-headed decisions.  Some of us are at least
<br>
sometimes berserk.  How does it aid any of us to deny this or to claim
<br>
simply acknowledging this truth causes all the misery in the world? 
<br>
Most misery is caused by either lack of knowledge and technology to deal
<br>
with problems or by actual wrong-headedness.  But identifying someone's
<br>
wrong-headedness does not automatically mean that the problem is in
<br>
oneself.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Division is endemic to social living as we know it: there is a knower here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a world out there. This division, useful in practical terms, becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deadly in the sphere of relationship, where the images we have built about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves constantly clash with those of others. Perhaps because we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lived with it so long, we treat the underlying process as &quot;normal&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content ourselves with dealing with symptoms. This can, at best, produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temporary alleviation: the root of the problem lies much deeper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is not an either-or.  There is a you-me-us dance and interplay. 
<br>
One's attention can touch on all of these and it is enriching to do so. 
<br>
But this is far from claiming the world's problems are the result of an
<br>
inability to do this and other similar things.
