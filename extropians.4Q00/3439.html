</em><br>
<p>Since it's spontaneous, it obviously doesn't require any endorsement.
<br>
What's really at issue here is accurately identifying human social trends
<br>
which are extropic (life affirming) and separating them from trends
<br>
accurately identified as entropic (tending to stasis).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, this misses the point that transhuman fascists, for example, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in no way extropic, not even by virtue of the fact that they support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism.
</em><br>
<p>You're talking about transhumanists who refer to themselves as &quot;fascists&quot;?
<br>
This boggles my bogosity meter. How can an admitted fascist (a usually
<br>
derogatory characterization) claim to support transhumanism? It seems to
<br>
me such an individual would experience a severe case of cognitive
<br>
dissonance, no? Or else the claim is just plain bogus.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you must nitpick, I suppose they're more entropic than luddites,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that's really not saying very much.
</em><br>
<p>No, not saying much at all, in light of how you've described their other
<br>
attributes. Fascistic luddites... sounds like a profile for self-hating
<br>
losers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Transhumanism without a commitment to extropy is just transhumanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This can turn into an extropic society, or it can turn out in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dystopic socialist nightmare.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I think I'm getting it now. Evidently transhumanists can go backward
<br>
as well as forward, they can revert to primordial primitivism and/or
<br>
progress toward their socialist dystopian future. Either way, your
<br>
explanation of them makes them seem irrelevant via their own imcompetence.
<br>
Unless of course they have some means for brainwashing a large population
<br>
and enslaving them to their twisted ideology. You didn't have that
<br>
scenario in mind, I trust.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider, for example, the Nazis, &lt;dum dum dum, discussion ends&gt; many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of whom would self-identify as transhuman fascists.  In a possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nazi future, the Aryan technocratic elite would live forever, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of us would be enslaved or crushed.  But just because the Aryan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elite would use High Tech to live forever doesn't mean that a Nazi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future would be anything close to extropic.  And they'd hardly mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.  As far as they're concerned, extropy is dumb.
</em><br>
<p>(Sigh) Now we've got these transhumans who are willing to identify
<br>
themselves not only as fascists, but also as nazis... So, how can they
<br>
expect any rational beings to take them seriously? Don't intelligent
<br>
people know that socialism doesn't work because it fails to provide
<br>
adequate incentives to produce the materials needed for prosperity? Don't
<br>
enough folks understand that nationalism means war? Doesn't the word
<br>
fascist elicit negative reactions from educated people? How can combining
<br>
all these dreadful failures of human thought into a &quot;transhuman&quot; (I use
<br>
the quotes because the word no longer means what it used to) community, do
<br>
more than supply the rest of the world with an easier way of targeting
<br>
them for extinction?
<br>
<p>I thought I had done my homework on this, Dan. Now it seems you're
<br>
informing me that transhumanists are somewhat lower on the evolutionary
<br>
scale than scum-sucking trolls. Well, at least I never told anyone that I
<br>
was a transhumanist.
