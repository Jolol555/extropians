For those still not convinced that Al Gore is a liar, gander at this:
<br>
Planet Puck noted that Al Gore was up to his old lies and misleading
<br>
taking of credit again...
<br>
&nbsp;Al Gore said (in his CONCESSION speech, no less): As for the battle
<br>
that ends tonight, I do believe, as my father once said, that no matter
<br>
how hard the loss, &quot;defeat may serve as well as victory to shake the
<br>
soul and let the glory out. &quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;This was really said by Edwin Markham, in Victory in Defeat: &quot;Defeat
<br>
may serve as well as victory to shake the soul and let the glory out.
<br>
&quot;(source)
<br>
&nbsp;We just dodged a bullet America.
