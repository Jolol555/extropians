<em>&gt; &gt; Working in Vermont as I do, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the current Civil Union controversy raging, it has turned out that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the overt 'hate' crimes committed here since the 'Take Back Vermont'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; grassroots campaign began were actually committed by gays trying to gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sympathy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please provide referrences proving your contention that all (overt?) hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crimes commited in the state of Vermont in the period in question were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually commited by gays.
</em><br>
<p>Those were the only two of consequence, that I already mentioned, but I
<br>
will research and see if there were others. The remainder were mostly
<br>
all phone calls to judges, clerks, and legislators. Many found that the
<br>
majority of the hostile invective during this whole period was from
<br>
those supporting civil unions, making many rather hateful remarks about
<br>
those opposed to civil unions on principle but who were not anti-gay in
<br>
particular.
<br>
<p>Most of the invective in the other direction has been, I have found,
<br>
anger that is a consequence of the individuals it is directed at being
<br>
royal jerks no matter what their persuasion is. If thats a crime, then
<br>
call me a bigot. I hate assholes too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sorry Harvey, I just don't accept claims of widespread rural bigotry at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the level you claim, except possibly in the rural South or other areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of strong Klan influence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not certain what level of rural bigotry Harvey was claiming, but rural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bigotry is generally considered a more insidious problem for several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons.  Large population centers tend to support greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural/orientational diversity.  Incidents are often under reported in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rural areas, due to denial for instance (see your post above.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A few quotes from the U.S. Department of Justice Policymaker's Guide to Hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Crimes:  (<a href="http://www.texasnaacp.org/hateguid.htm#1">http://www.texasnaacp.org/hateguid.htm#1</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It's alarming that a number of communities reporting said that no hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crimes were committed within their jurisdictions,&quot; said Stephen Arent, vice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chairman of the ADL's National Civil Rights Committee. &quot;Unfortunately there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a great deal of denial. Many communities would say that hate crimes don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This is funny, actually. Most of those same communities experience no
<br>
murders, car thefts, robberies, or other major crimes, yet does the
<br>
federal government claim they are also lying about that too? If so,
<br>
where are the bodies??? Insurance claims? These communities typically
<br>
have one or two part time policemen, and some go decades without any
<br>
sort of death under questionable circumstances.
<br>
<p>As hard as it may seem for some people to believe, there are, in fact,
<br>
many communities of peaceful, broad minded, tolerant people in this
<br>
country who are pushing no agenda, and want nothing more than to be left
<br>
in peace. There will always be individuals who are bigoted, but guess
<br>
what? Its their RIGHT. So far as I know, thought is not yet a crime in
<br>
this country, and its not your right to claim to be violated just
<br>
because not everybody thinks you are super.
