Here is a sci-fi Machiavellian ploy I just though of and not to be taken as a serious proposal: let's get three of us together who are terminally ill (or just have death wishes). The first one will kill the second, and frame the third. The third will go along with it, hire a hack lawyer, be declared guilty, and get the death penalty (do it in Texas and make sure participant number one is black and participants number two is a cop). He'll sign up for cryonics and win a lawsuit. After he is frozen, the actual killer comes forward to confess to the murder, and there we have a known innocent death penalty victim frozen, and a cause celebre for cryonics.

<p>I want to option your screenplay for Grigg Pictures Inc.! lol  Actually, this is a ingenious plot you have hatched but I don't know how easily you could find volunteers for it.  If there are any writers here among us(talking to you Damien!) they should turn this into a screenplay for the new Outer Limits series because it would fit right in with what they do.
<br>
<p>Really.
<br>
<p>sincerely,
