Subject: a criticism site
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I came across another criticism site, entitled &quot;The War Against Transhumans
</em><br>
And Extropians: Impartial &gt;Progress&quot; (yeeps). Its address is
<br>
<a href="http://transhuman.singlegoal.com/">http://transhuman.singlegoal.com/</a> . It's run by the same people who run
<br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.singlegoal.com/">http://www.singlegoal.com/</a> , a site espousing &quot;impartial thought&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The page begins, &quot;Transhumanism concerns anyone who cares about progress
</em><br>
and purpose in life. It is a &gt;rather rare kind of philosophy in that it
<br>
holds progress to be both worthwhile and achievable through human &gt;effort,
<br>
and that such progress should include evolving beyond human beings. The
<br>
problem I have with them &gt;is that they lack sufficient passion for progress
<br>
as well as the discipline to pursue it. They are stuck thinking &gt;in terms of
<br>
ethics and values of the past.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So it seems like this person has a mistaken view of
</em><br>
Transhumanism/Extropianism; I mean, dang, 'thinking in &gt;terms of ethics and
<br>
values of the past'!? Hardly! :-)
<br>
<p>Yes, I do not think this criticism is fair, but I think the previous points
<br>
might
<br>
have some substance. That is why I am Post-human rather than wishy-washy
<br>
trans-somewhereinthemiddle-human. I cannot easily distinguish trans-human
<br>
views from the human scientific mainstream .... both believe in progress
<br>
through
<br>
science ... and if you stretch the time scale far enough into the future,
<br>
most
<br>
scientists who accept evolution also accept that sooner or later we will
<br>
become
<br>
a different/ new species. The Post-human stance is to be more passionate &amp;
<br>
proactive in order to compact this time-scale and experience the benefits
<br>
ourselves.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&quot;The challenge is not how quickly we can transcend humanity; every century
</em><br>
that goes by is insignificant in &gt;cosmic terms. The only thing that matters
<br>
is risk. We need to find the safest, most conservative, and most &gt;probable
<br>
path to achieving a state of unlimited progress.&quot; Aha! This is sort of a
<br>
combination of the 'Turning &gt;Point' people's views
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.turnpoint.org">http://www.turnpoint.org</a> ) with &quot;transhumanism&quot;, the former distorting the
<br>
latter. While &gt;centuries may be 'insignificant in cosmic terms', how many
<br>
people will suffer and die in those 'insignificant' &gt;centuries?
<br>
<p>But by making this &quot;safest, most conservative&quot; statement you are just
<br>
proving
<br>
the original criticism &quot;problem I have with them is that they lack
<br>
sufficient passion
<br>
for progress as well as the discipline to pursue it.&quot;
<br>
<p>And if you want the safest and most conservative route, then you will likely
<br>
adhere to
<br>
the &quot;tried and tested&quot; values and ethics of the past ..... rather than (for
<br>
example)
<br>
really promoting hard the post-human quorate sexual groupings above the
<br>
human-era
<br>
traditional pair-bonds .....
