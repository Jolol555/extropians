mathematical operation of addition does not seem to convey what actually

<p><em>&gt; Same for all the other logical and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; (logos = mind) basis rather than an observable, empirical basis.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  See especially the Kitcher book I mention above.  I don't want
<br>
to recount all his arguments here, but that book should be required reading
<br>
for any interested in philosophy of math.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Not actually.  Einstein made certain assumptions and deduced things from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; them.  In some ways, his assumptions were bolder, more consistent, and
</em><br>
more
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; parsimonious than those of others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maths deals with generalities: &quot;Energy is Mass speedolight squared&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever is a claim about physical properties .... sure Einstein used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; THOUGHT experiments, but Philosophy cannot claim proprietorship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over all types of &quot;thinking&quot; (see fuller response to Harvey Newstrom)...
</em><br>
<p>I don't make that claim.  In another post, I've defined philosophy as
<br>
roughly general beliefs about life, the universe, and everything.  That
<br>
said, I'm not making it into everything.  (Everyone here should take the
<br>
time to tell us what they mean by philosophy in neutral terms before bashing
<br>
it.)
<br>
<p>My point about Einstein, though, was not that he was doing philosophy at
<br>
every turn, just that a lot of his work was done not empirically but by the
<br>
hypothetico-deductive method: positing certain notions then finding out
<br>
where they led.  After all, a purely empirical approach would have been just
<br>
to _stop_ with the Lorentz equation and no draw any further conclusions from
<br>
it.  It worked, right?  No need to speculate, if you're a pure empiricist...
<br>
But Einstein wasn't and the rest came from that.
