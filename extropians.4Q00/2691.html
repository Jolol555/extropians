<p>I agree here.  I know many Boomers now who look at my generation and the one

after it as irresponsible because of high drug use -- even when their teen
<br>
drug use was much higher and probably much less well-informed.:)

<p><em>&gt; Regards defeating a Soviet Missile attack using 1980 technology, you jump

to
<br>
<em>&gt; conclusion, I feel. Let us define the goal and then define the technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The main avenue of attack was to defeat the Communist Party CCCP--that is

the
<br>

</em><br>
<p>True.  One reason the Soviets fell appears to be their inability to compete
<br>
in the high tech realm.  In 1980s, does anyone here think the Soviets had
<br>
better predictive capabilities?  Does anyone think that one thing that might
<br>
have been eating at their minds was the possibility that the SDI program
<br>
might work and basically annull their nuclear threat?  If I had been one of
<br>
their strategists, I definitely would've thought hard on the possibility --
<br>
instead of just ignoring it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now there were a few methods we might have tried and did not, to defeat an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack--even given the technology of the time. It's probably better to
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; had no successful missile defense system, as things happened, but to say
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; was unworkable because Sagan demurred or Kostia Tsipis, found it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagreeable; is no reason to propagandize against it. Hence, one could
</em><br>
find
<br>
<em>&gt; such democratic-socialist like Dyson, give a different spin on things.
</em><br>
<p>The lack of a missle defense system worked most likely because the two
<br>
sides -- Soviets and Americans -- did not want a nuclear war on any scale.
<br>
If it had been the Americans versus the Red Chinese, history might have been
<br>
different, since on many accounts, the latter have limited nuclear war as
<br>
part of their doctrine.  (Whether this is to scare other nations is a matter
<br>
we can debate, but current intelligence seems to support my claim.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For a variety of reasons, 90% because the Politics changed we do not have
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; Balistic Missile Defense system. Not because the technology was inherently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong. Will you also now say that we do not drive around on fuel cells or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a lunar colony &quot;because the technology didn't work&quot;? No, these are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions, wise or unwise; and its all the road not taken. Sagan had his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biases, as do I, as do you.
</em><br>
<p>Good point!  History -- heck, life! -- is full of contigencies.  One can't
<br>
argue that what happened had to necessarily happen.  Plus to grab one
<br>
prediction that came true -- evne if only provisionally so -- and use it as
<br>
if the predictor is [nearly] always right is a fallacy often made in these
<br>
areas.  If I make enough predictions, especially if they aren't all off the
<br>
wall, one is eventually going to come true...
<br>
<p>My two cents!
