<p>Spike already gave one reference from the POF(premature ovarian failure)
<br>
website. Another one is:

[Researchers in his laboratory...sewed bits of the tissue to a scaffold made
<br>
of surgical foam. Then (Dr. Kutluk) Oktay...implanted the tissue into Ms.
<br>
Lloyd-Hart's pelvis, where it soon began producing hormones.]

<p><em>&gt; If true, I wonder why frozen ovaries and frozen embryos are viable

<br>
[The technology so far applied clinically has been based directly on
<br>
traditional human embryo cryopreservation protocols, and has produced
<br>
relatively few offspring. Fortunately to date, no abnormalities have been
<br>
reported from these pregnancies, regardless of the persistent concerns that
<br>
freezing and thawing of mature oocytes may disrupt the meiotic spindle and
<br>
thus increase the potential for aneuploidy in the embryos arising from such
<br>
eggs.]
<br>
[...for one notable exception, where a pregnancy arose from an immature
<br>
germinal vesicle (GV) stage egg (Tucker et al, 1998b). Interestingly, this
<br>
stage of egg development might prove to be a more successful approach for
<br>
cryopreservation because its oolemma is more permeable to cryoprotectant,
<br>
and its chromatin is more conveniently and safely packaged in the nucleus
<br>
...]

<br>
[Ovarian Tissue Banking Interview with Dr. Jill Shaw:...Ovarian tissue is
<br>
very tolerant of cryopreservation...(however)...Data for the mouse indicates
<br>
that aging in the body and brain does influence the graft. The consequence
<br>
of this is that even a whole young ovary placed in an older recipient will
<br>
only exhibit a limited lifespan. It is likely that the same will apply to
<br>
the human. Small grafts may therefore only restore one or a small number of
<br>
cycles.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you have not thought about this before, here are some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ramifications of freezing eggs as a way to postpone child-bearing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...Companies catering to egg donors start a thriving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industry (another niche for Alcor, perhaps?).
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, of course Alcor could diversify. But why stop at the
<br>
cryopreservation of eggs?
<br>
<p>Amara, you could go through one IVF cycle and perhaps retrieve 9 eggs. Have
<br>
three eggs frozen. Have the other six fertilized in vitro with sperm donated
<br>
from six different Extropians. Freeze three of these resulting embryos and
<br>
implant the other three. Carry all three to term. However prior to natural
<br>
delivery have Alcor &quot;extract&quot; and cryopreserve two fetuses. Later, when
<br>
you're ready for another child, ring up Alcor.
