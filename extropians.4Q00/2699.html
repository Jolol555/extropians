<em>&gt; Most bioethics has been of the &quot;just say no to germline
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering!&quot;-style so far, to my knowledge there has been less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studies of a transhumanist approach to what changes are good, bad and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be allowed or disallowed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One ethical principle I have been thinking of is reversibility:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic modifications that have reversible effects (e.g. controllable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using artificial hormones) should obviously be OK, since if you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like them you can always switch them off at a low cost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another is flexibility: changes that increase the available range of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially desirable options are preferable to changes or states with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more limited options. 
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me there are two ways to look at it.  One is to be
<br>
conservative (for an Extropian) and to say that germ line engineering
<br>
is new, it is unpredictable in its consequences, and so we should only
<br>
allow or support changes which are clearly safe, along the lines Anders
<br>
proposes.
<br>
<p>Another approach is more aggressive.  Throughout history parents have
<br>
had the right and power to force their children to grow up in difficult
<br>
circumstances.  Parents who leave a safe and comfortable village and
<br>
strike out on a migration across the Asiatic land bridge, or get into
<br>
a boat and travel for weeks and months to reach a new world, inherently
<br>
force their children born and unborn to take the same risks.
<br>
<p>How much worse is germ line engineering than moving to a land where you
<br>
don't even know if your children will be able to survive?  And where,
<br>
in many historical cases, children did not survive?  Should we condemn
<br>
those who took chances in the past?  Or don't we applaud their courage
<br>
and daring?
<br>
<p>Of course, we live in a different era today.  Our world is one which
<br>
minimizes risk, which builds a safety net to support those who fail.
<br>
<p>But this is a cultural choice, not something which we should accept
<br>
unthinkingly.  Do we want to play it safe?  Or do we want to support
<br>
those who take risks, yes, even risks with their children's lives, in
<br>
the hopes of giving them advantages in the world to come?
<br>
<p>Hal
<br>
<p>P.S. Much of the current protectiveness towards children can be seen as
<br>
part of the cycle identified by Strauss &amp; Howe, discussed at their web
<br>
site www.fourthturning.com.  If they are right we may see a change away
<br>
from modern day overprotectiveness in the next few decades.  I wonder if
<br>
our views on germ line engineering and other technologies will change once
<br>
&quot;we're doing it for the children&quot; starts to sound old-fashioned.
