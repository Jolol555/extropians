Chucking in my 2 cents...
<br>
<p>I like to think of consciousness/identity (the continuous self which we all
<br>
cling to, and which we nontheless cannot explain, or even demonstrate the
<br>
existence of), as like a whirlpool.
<br>
<p>A whirlpool is a thing, which we can name, see, which we can say exists. Yet
<br>
it isn't anything, really, except for a part of fluid flow. The fluid is the
<br>
substrate, the whirlpool is superposed on it, an epiphenomenon.
<br>
<p>If you exactly measured the whirlpool at a point in time, the fluid flows,
<br>
the topology, whatever, and constructed a similar stream elsewhere, set up
<br>
the fluid flows in exactly the same way, then you should get an exactly
<br>
identical whirlpool. Dynamic systems people will cringe - um, we probably
<br>
have to assume omniscience/omnipotence to achieve this, but hey, it's the
<br>
extro list after all.
<br>
<p>Is it the same whirlpool? No. It's a copy. It's history would make it out to
<br>
be the same whirlpool; if you ran a (super omniscient) sim of it's flow
<br>
backwards, you would infer all the original behaviour of the original
<br>
stream, even though the copy never did these things. Actually, if your sim
<br>
was good enough, you might infer the copying event, but let's assume it's
<br>
not. Why? Because I want to. Hmph.
<br>
<p>Why did you do this? Maybe you have a new picotech material which can behave
<br>
exactly like water, and you want to move the whirlpool from water to this
<br>
Water++. Cool. But copying wont do it; it's not the same whirlpool.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, you could release your picotech material into the
<br>
original stream, and slowly shut out the water flow. Eventually, the
<br>
substrate is Water++, and the whirlpool remains, the same whirlpool in a
<br>
different medium.
<br>
<p>(warning - metaphor stretched beyond safe limits... please back up your work
<br>
and switch topics)
<br>
<p>Ok, the analogue to this in consciousness, is the comparison of a copy-style
<br>
upload, to a gradual upload.
<br>
<p>A copy-style upload takes a snapshot of the brain/body at some point in
<br>
time, and uses it as the initial data in a sim. This copy will feel as
<br>
though it is the original, teleported into the sim abruptly. Unfortunately,
<br>
the original exists also, and feels like nothing happened. It may experience
<br>
a lot of fear and then not much of anything, as a lot of the copy upload
<br>
scenarios seem to involve doing away with the original.
<br>
<p>A gradual, incremental upload, sees the component parts of the physiology
<br>
that supports consciousness being replaced gradually (ie: over some amount
<br>
of time), by non-biological, and eventually entirely virtual, replacements
<br>
which keep all remaining biological material at any point in time running as
<br>
if nothing had happened. In a nutshell, this might be replacing neurons by
<br>
nanobots, one by one, the nanobots moving their processing from local to
<br>
remote (inside some sim maybe). All the while, the subject remains
<br>
conscious. The idea is that consciousness, whilst changing substrate, will
<br>
retain it's integrity. This is movement, not copying. Hopefully.
<br>
<p>Who knows what would happen? Perhaps the original entity's &quot;consciousness&quot;
<br>
would imperceptibly slip away, at a level removed from conscious thought,
<br>
such that the individual would not notice in time or at all. This seems like
<br>
a tree-falling-in-the-forest kind of problem, but perhaps an answer is
<br>
warranted.
<br>
<p>In any case, I feel that the whirlpool metaphor, and incremental replacement
<br>
scenario, are the most palatable to those who believe in the illusion of
<br>
consciousness (myself included), and desire to upload, without losing that
<br>
most dear to us.
