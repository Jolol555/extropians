<p>Its not surprising that Joe is still beating the dead horse of the 'sporting
<br>
use', a term that was invented by the Nazis to justify their gun confiscation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Flash suppressors

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They're great for hiding the source location of snipers, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at night.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You had to do it...&lt;sigh&gt;.  A flash suppressor does *not* (repeat:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does *not*) have any use for hiding snipers.  In fact, real snipers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intentionally do not use flash suppressors because it actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases the muzzle signature (yes, really). But then, if you knew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you were talking about you wouldn't have mentioned it. Remember,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the real world isn't like the movies.
</em><br>
<p>This is funny. You know, when I was in Panama during the invasion, I was picking
<br>
off panamanian snipers firing on our flight line by spotting them by the star
<br>
pattern the flash suppressors on their rifles put out, especially at night. Joe
<br>
can't seem to help but put his foot in his mouth...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So you don't want the herd to know where you're picking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them off from?  It's not a (game) hunting attachment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some people don't seem to use their brain much either.  Should we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demand that they get a lobotomy?  Sure they seem harmless now, but a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fool is just *begging* for trouble.
</em><br>
<p>And, actually, it is a hunting attachment. Both raccoon and bear hunters mount
<br>
flshlights on them for their night hunting. Get real, Joe.
