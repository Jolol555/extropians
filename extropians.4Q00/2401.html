<p>
There was a very nice episode of StarGate week before last, in which a
<br>
society that had supposedly evolved from pre-Aztec Mexican Indian was
<br>
encountered.  The nasties had forced them from their Earth homes and they
<br>
had recently gotten on that slippery slope to the Singularity, as evidenced
<br>
by the fact that they were all infested with nanites.  Furthermore, they had
<br>
progressed technologically in a few decades as much as Earth culture had in
<br>
several hundred years.
<br>
<p>As to how, certain individuals were chosen at an early age to receive a huge
<br>
load of unprogrammed nanites in addition to the usual programmed array.
<br>
They then specialized in some area of research, typically making as much
<br>
progress before their teens as several generations of normal humans.  At the
<br>
point when they had peaked out in what they had to offer, they then
<br>
volunteered to be sacrificed - the Aztec connection, of course.
<br>
<p>The child victims, however, unlike most of the actual Aztec sacrifices, who
<br>
were taken from subject tribes and probably would have distinctly preferred
<br>
another life path, volunteered eagerly to have their brains wiped.  Their
<br>
nanites were removed en masse and then distributed throughout the
<br>
population, giving everyone the knowledge they had gained.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, this left the children with a virtual tabula rosa.  Just to
<br>
make the moral dillemna interesting, they could never again receive or
<br>
benefit from a nanite knowledge implant.
<br>
<p>The scenario is rather implausible, to say the least, but it was very
<br>
cleverly arranged and the solutions that various parties arrived at were
<br>
both clever and non-obvious.
<br>
<p>Many questions were left hanging at the end.  Is a person who has lost most
<br>
of their abstract memory still that same person?  Where would you draw the
<br>
lines?  If most of your working consciousness is actually handled by a host
<br>
of nanites, then are giving something up or are you gaining by spreading
<br>
them all over creation, such that your experience of who you are is shared
<br>
by a million other consciousnesses?
<br>
<p>While the plot and its handling was somewhat juvenile by EXTROPIAN
<br>
standards, this was definitely an episode that will make the viewers think,
<br>
and an excellent example of how to bring serious abstract
<br>
techno/philosophical issues in public consciousness and debate without
<br>
trivializing them.
