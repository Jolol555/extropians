<em>&gt; Subject: Re: Sentience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; OK, I've only sold you on part of the package so far, but think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the conceptual stuff likely follows, even if I haven't yet developed a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conscious machine on the MVT model, or a telepathy device to check
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for consciousness. There seems no reason in principle why a device
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could not me made that could sit in a shielded room, away from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subject looking at playing cards or visual stimuli, and arriving at
</em><br>
correct
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; predictions of what card the person is thinking of ... quantum physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allows this possibility, as does logic.  Then your points about
</em><br>
subjectivity
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might be rejected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arriving at what card the person is focusing on could be done using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MVT'.  MVT would add that the person is THINKING about that card,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which you can't show scientifically, can NEVER show scientifically.
</em><br>
<p>So what you think is that MVT' is as good as it can get .. that claims
<br>
about 'mind' are always going to be unverifiable ... even if
<br>
mind-transference
<br>
or telepathy was possible ....  end of story? Unless I enforce my views on
<br>
you my new hypnosis developed from MVT .... and not just threaten it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Got a telepathy machine that tells me how and what I feel?  How do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know it works correctly, or that it worked at all?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; The mind is unobservable, unverifiable on any physical test, even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle, because no test is available above and beyond a test for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior and physical phenomena.
</em><br>
<p>OK, do you take a Rylean view that &quot;mind&quot; is a category mistake and only
<br>
seems a thing because language exists that describes it as an 'object?'
<br>
<p>There seems some mileage in this, but I happen to think that if MVT accounts
<br>
for all types of animal intelliegence/ conscious behaviour and (observable)
<br>
cognitive patterns ... then it does permit me to postulate an extended
<br>
&quot;analogous&quot;
<br>
stronger version that take in consciousness as well ... if only for the sake
<br>
of
<br>
aesthetic completion  ... and because some people will be able to find use
<br>
in
<br>
accepting the MVT structure (to replace faulty supernaturalist and
<br>
lingoistic
<br>
competing theories of 'consciousness' such as Berkeley's Mind of God
<br>
Idealism).
<br>
<p>Your stricter aesthetic does not permit you to find merit in the stronger
<br>
conclusions
<br>
of MVT, but does help in answering the important questions about the
<br>
evoloution
<br>
of animal &quot;conscious behaviour&quot; .... so everybody should be happy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, no.  Holes are not &quot;objects&quot; at all.  They denote places where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain objects aren't, though I'm willing to extend the analogy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex systems which have a missing component or a missing function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A hole in the earth is not psychological.  One might be led to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so the fact that holes acquire NAMES by virtue of the fact that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name them, think about them, and have a psychology in which that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, but that doesn't make holes psychological entities.
</em><br>
<p>The category of a particular area of space as a &quot;hole&quot; is indeed
<br>
psychological ... the hole can only be demarked independently of its
<br>
(physical) substrate by the naming of it (seeing it, pattern completion,
<br>
and formulating it as a linguistic/ conceptual entity). It has no &quot;matter&quot;
<br>
so isn't physical ..... but is observable ... an observer-related effect.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In this analysis, there isn't any &quot;behaviour&quot;, just awareness of
</em><br>
behaviour.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So the question is not 'what about consciousness' which is a given, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;what about BEHAVIOUR?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A common move in arguments of this kind.  But you REALLY don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commit yourself to positions like this, because you've backed yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into holding a phenomenological theory: that all we're in touch with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is our sensations and that everything else that isn't a sensation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspect.
</em><br>
<p>This seems at least as &quot;sensible&quot; as the epiphenomenalist claim.
<br>
Again, I think the issue might be as much to do with aesthetics and
<br>
cognitive style as to which side of this (ultimately pointless) divide you
<br>
choose.
<br>
I prefer to concentrate on the empirical matters and observable phenomena,
<br>
and think this conversation has been a prime example of the ultimate
<br>
futility
<br>
of philosophical analysis.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To be a consistent phenomenologist, one ought to be uniformly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeptical of the whole scientific enterprise.  Granted, if you give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific statements a strong anti-realist reinterpretation (&quot;when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you say voltmeter, you mean voltmeter-like sensations...&quot;) you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salvage much of science, but even then you still have no explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the link up between sensations-of-brains and consciousness.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help in providing a link-up.
</em><br>
<p>The link between phantom (ex-) limbs and sensations in the previously
<br>
physically occupied space is well documented in medical science.
<br>
Likewise the neurosignature and gateway theory of pain strongly supports
<br>
this linkage. In practice (as a therapist) we do not have the luxury of
<br>
engaging
<br>
in philosophical quibbles, but must act positively to alleviate the symptoms
<br>
according to our best judgement.
<br>
<p>Your &quot;consciousness isn't real&quot; posture just doesn't cut it in workaday
<br>
reality.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Attacking the mind-body problem from the mind side instead of the body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't help you a bit.
</em><br>
<p>But you have conceded the priority of the mental by your admission that IF
<br>
my MVT hypnotic persuasion works, then you agree with my stronger claims
<br>
for MVT. We only ever *experience* the world as filtered through ideation
<br>
and our senses.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Free-will is only &quot;fruitful&quot; to the extent that it doesn't entail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fatalism.  But determinism doesn't entail fatalism either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Determinism also suggests that we might be right about the connection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between Turing machines and brains, which Cognitive Science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; departments around the world seem to have found, ah, rather fruitful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed!
</em><br>
<p>No Turing machines of the sort you discuss have ever, not will ever,be
<br>
built. Analogigies can be useful to cognitive scientists ... sure .. in the
<br>
same way that MVT phantom eye is useful as a cognitive model for both
<br>
intelliegence AND consciousness.
<br>
But no cognitive scientists claim the Turing analogogy is an analogy for
<br>
*consciousness* ... just for intelligence.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, of course, if you convince me that way, I will be convinced, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfied with the answer.  But does the fact that you COULD do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfy me?  No.  Because you'd be using MVT' to do all of this.  None
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the philosophical parts are required.
</em><br>
<p>So you would be convinced by the practice, but not by the theory ... a
<br>
fair comment. I adhere to certain psychotherapeutic ethics that might
<br>
inhibit
<br>
me using such techniques on you involuntarily, but I might consider doing
<br>
this experiment if you consent ......
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't the answer obvious?  You say, like a true scientist: &quot;I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know the answer.  There is no evidence.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Neo-Darwinian evolution remains a &quot;theory&quot; and religious creationist
<br>
fundamentalists will never accept it as fact ... but in practice most
<br>
scientists (as opposed to quibbling philosophers) accept it in practice
<br>
since the circumstantial, explanatory and utility case for is overwhelming.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;The illusionary body part isn't there *at all*.
</em><br>
<p>In precisely the same way that thoughts/ mentation/ consciousness isn't
<br>
there *at all* ..... just the experience of them!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You've overloaded &quot;illusionary body part.&quot;  We use the term to refer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to both the feeling of the missing limb, and there's the &quot;hole&quot; where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the limb was.  These are not the same, though they are linked.  But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know how.
</em><br>
<p>But saying you don't know how isn't to say they aren't linked.
<br>
You overload the term &quot;conscious behaviour&quot; to cover both physical
<br>
events and mental events.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;that the world of consciousness can interact with non-existent objects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;because consciousness doesn't exist in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We have an overloading of the word &quot;existence&quot; here. Let us stamp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out mere verbal triviality and stick to the phenomena where possible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; please.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it's relevant.  See, the mind can't affect the &quot;holes.&quot;  So it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't affect the brain.
</em><br>
<p>The SHAPE of the brain effects its function, the shape evolved, and
<br>
(gestalt)
<br>
can be described in terms of foreground OR background (holes), or both.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for unconscious processes...  I just don't know about that.
</em><br>
<p>Scientists aren't happy having to say I just don't know, but would rather
<br>
try
<br>
to find out, and at least put forward their best hypothesis. Be positive.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Behavior.  They're alike in *behavior*.  One more complex than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other, but otherwise, alike.  They're not alike in origin or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate.  They're alike in behavior.
</em><br>
<p>Other than that they are both playing the same game (maybe this is what you
<br>
mean &quot;alike in behaviour&quot;) the cognitive processes and chess style are
<br>
quite different.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I haven't at all: that was an argument that, even when you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modify your metaprogramming, you are DETERMINED to modify your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metaprogramming, and thenceforth DETERMINED to follow your new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (meta)program.  Always following the program, you are determined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Then, if we are determined in such a way that we have the option to
<br>
intervene and change our cognitive patterns .... then we are determined
<br>
in such a way that we have free-will. The whole trans/ post-human venture
<br>
is an excercise of free-will against the cultural conditioning to remain the
<br>
same (boring, human, not-fit-to-run-the-planet received wisdom).
<br>
<p>I, like you, could choose to trot out a philosophical case different from
<br>
the one
<br>
I aesthetically prefer (and find easier to argue) ....  possibly the
<br>
move-response
<br>
format of dialogue (Hegelian dialect) shapes the argument ... and the only
<br>
certain
<br>
course open to win chicken/egg type arguments is by trial of strength of the
<br>
persausive or hypnotic relative strengths of each party .... it certainly
<br>
gives us
<br>
a new option to philosophical logic-chopping. I am not sure that the better
<br>
arguments always win in practice, but often it is the stronger Will.
<br>
<p>I agree that von Neumann machines &amp; neural nets can often both solve the
<br>
same problems ... and that both ultimately rely on the laws of statistical
<br>
mechanics ... but the von Neuman machines ARE determined more fully since
<br>
they are fully predictive, whereas the internal state of neural computers
<br>
are NOT
<br>
analysable and discrete ..... the weight state does not translate into
<br>
particular known
<br>
properties. Serial machine emulations are just that, simulations. They are
<br>
running
<br>
a whole bunch of code whilst true parallel neuro-computers have no code.
<br>
They
<br>
cannot DO real-time computations .. so how can you even say that they
<br>
&quot;emulate&quot;
<br>
real time computations?
<br>
