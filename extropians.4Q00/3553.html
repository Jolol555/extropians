Harvey: 
<br>
<p>You appear to be arguing something different from me. I spoke
<br>
specifically of &quot;the Xanies&quot;, those involved with Project Xanadu. I
<br>
don't see how you could factually disagree that the people working on
<br>
Xanadu through at least 1990, all of whom I know personally, would not
<br>
have had the reaction I suggest, more or less.
<br>
<p>How familiar are you with those people and the Xanadu code? The Xanadu
<br>
architecture provided for &quot;indexing&quot; at the time of entry of data. It
<br>
provided for royalty at byte granularity. Linear time indexing after the
<br>
fact is *expensive*, and all of the Xanadu people I know would have
<br>
expected any such substantial effort to have been recouped somehow.
<br>
<p>The universe can surprise you.
