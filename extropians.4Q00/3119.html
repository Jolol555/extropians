<p><p>Bio
<br>
Dr.Brent Adams, currently of the Department of Mechanical Engineering Brigham Young University, and co-workers were the first to introduce fully automated scanning electron microscopy based upon the rapid indexing of electron backscattering diffraction patterns, Orientation Imaging Microscopy (OIM). OIM provides a complete association of local crystallographic orientation and phase with the geometry of microstructure in two-dimensional section planes. The method has been competitively commercialized and distributed as a tool for materials characterization in more than 250 laboratories around the world.
<br>
<p>Abstract
<br>
Mechanical design can be conducted in a framework where consideration of microstructure as a continuous design variable is facilitated by use of a Fourier space.  This new approach is called microstructure-sensitive design (MSD).  Selection of the mechanical framework for the problem (e.g., mechanical constitutive model) dictates the dimensionality of the pertinent microstructure representation in the Fourier space.  Microstructure is considered to be comprised of basic elements that belong to a material set. The universe of pertinent microstructures is found to be the convex hull of the material set, and is named the material hull.  Design performance, in terms of specified design objectives and constraints, is represented by one or more families of hyper-surfaces (often hyper-planes) of finite dimension that intersect the material hull.  These are named iso-property surfaces. By consideration of the intersections of iso-property surfaces with the material hull, the full rang!
