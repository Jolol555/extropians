Just noticed this on the net:
<br>
<p><a href="http://theanimist.netgazer.net.au/pg000014.html#The">http://theanimist.netgazer.net.au/pg000014.html#The</a> Initiate
<br>
<p>Here's a partial:
<br>
<p>&lt;The Last Mortal Generation, written by a devotee of the cult of science
<br>
(which has held sway over the mind of Western man for the past four or so
<br>
centuries), gives us a timely overview of what the 'white-coats' are up to
<br>
in the realm of immortality research. It also gives us some interesting
<br>
insights into how they view the human condition:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We might be the last humans in history doomed to perish simply because
<br>
we can't  do anything about it.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;Though I admire the depth of vision and imaginative genius on display in
<br>
this work I have many problems with its philosophical underpinnings.
<br>
Broderick, and the scientists he discusses, seem to have little conception
<br>
of old age and death as necessary parts of the human life cycle. This to me
<br>
is the major weakness of the book. It is taken as fact that old age and
<br>
death are evils to be avoided at all costs, that they are in short
<br>
pathologies of the human, diseases, rather than experiences related to
<br>
summarising, relinquishment and moving on. True to the philosophy of
<br>
materialism, the book's analysis centres upon the physiology of ageing and
<br>
death ... little time is spent on the psychology of old age, the immense
<br>
psychospiritual changes (the getting of wisdom?) that accompany old age and
<br>
that may even be necessary to younger generations. Are we to believe that
<br>
the reveries of old age, the processes of looking back, of advising, of
<br>
learning from experiences, of learning from the various stages of the life
<br>
cycle, of learning to accept and come to terms with death and its capacity
<br>
to illuminate the meaning of life are to be dismissed as 'aspects of a
<br>
disease' in the same way that Broderick dismisses the physical changes
<br>
associated with the same? Don't get me wrong here I'm not saying that we
<br>
end research into technologies which stop people dying by non-natural means
<br>
- I am no Jehova's Witness. My quibble, rather, is with the desire to
<br>
reverse the natural processes of old age, to flee from death and other life
<br>
experiences into science and technology. The cult of youth that sees
<br>
millions of older people yearly submit their bodies and psyches to invasive
<br>
surgery, hormone therapy and other 'remedies' in order to avoid the
<br>
wrinkles and character lines of old age seems to be all of a piece with
<br>
this strange fear of death and ageing that now motivates scientists to
<br>
search for eternal youth.
<br>
&nbsp;These and other issues are matters of personal opinion, however, and to
<br>
give Broderick his due many such objections receive a fair hearing in the
<br>
book. Although I would recommend more criticism of the peculiar world view
<br>
of the scientists Broderick discusses - with a special emphasis on the
<br>
possibility that there is something psychologically suspect about people
<br>
who flee from old age in particular - the book itself is a factual,
<br>
well-researched and imaginative discussion of scientific developments which
<br>
are altering our sense of what it is to be human - even as we speak.
<br>
&nbsp;As a final thought: One day soon it may take courage to allow oneself to
<br>
grow old and die: we live in eerie times when death becomes the ultimate
<br>
subversive act. &gt;
