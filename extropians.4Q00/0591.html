These guys would enrich the list, and rather then hear from people who claim 
<br>
they have read thir works (and put their own spin on it) we could hear 
<br>
directly. On the other hand, interacting with a few of the opinionated 
<br>
schmucks, might drive them kicking and screaming back to their solitude. 
<br>
Please warn them about what goes on here, also so we can avoid culture shock. 
<br>
Thanks.

&nbsp;Spuuuud!  Man that is one helllll of a good idea.  I need to let him
<br>
&nbsp;know he has a loooot of friends he doesnt even know about, over
<br>
&nbsp;here on extropians.  That never occurred to me to invite Zub to
<br>
&nbsp;post his ideas over here.

&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;I dont know Hans Moravec other than his pitch at Nerdstock at
<br>
&nbsp;Standford.  Anyone else know him?

&nbsp;Rudy Rucker!  I met Rudy last May, and MAN was I impressed with
<br>
&nbsp;that guy.  Blew me away.  On top of being a software genius and
<br>
&nbsp;all-around good guy, he is even a great cook, of all things.  I definitely
<br>
&nbsp;wanna be like him when I grow up.  spike &gt;&gt;
