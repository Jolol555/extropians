<br>
<em>&gt; One of the reasons I've never gone for a second trip (besides 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm now a &quot;responsible&quot; husband and father) is I heard that use,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly repeated use, can lead to &quot;flashbacks.&quot;  Granted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my trip was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoroughly enjoyable, but I don't know that I'd want it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kicking back in at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unexpected times.  Say, while on the job....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think that flashbacks are also widely overstated?
</em><br>
<p>As a matter of fact, I do think flashbacks are overstated, both in terms of
<br>
frequency and in terms of what they actually comprise.
<br>
<p>When I used to imagine what a &quot;flashback&quot; would be like, I imagined walking
<br>
down the street and suddenly having a full on psychedelic experience, as if
<br>
I had consumed a hallucinogen and were once more under its full effects.
<br>
<p>I have never had such an experience.  Nor has anyone reported such an
<br>
experience to me.
<br>
<p>What I have experienced is as follows:
<br>
<p>1) During a psychedelic experience, one observes some phenomena - perhaps
<br>
the brownian motion of cream dispersing through your coffee cup.  That
<br>
phenomena, which might normally be ignored as quite ordinary, this time
<br>
seems quite profound and enchanting.  Perhaps there is even some new and
<br>
valid insight into something occurring in the system.
<br>
<p>2) Later, in a &quot;sober&quot; state, one comes back into contact with that same
<br>
phenomena.  This time the swirling of cream in coffee is far more
<br>
interesting when it was before you observed it in a psychedelic state.  The
<br>
observation also triggers memory of that psychedelic state, and perhaps
<br>
elicits the observation of other perceptual details that one normally
<br>
overlooks in day to day life.  However one's overall conscious state
<br>
remains quite &quot;sober&quot;.  
<br>
<p>I find this pattern to be about what I expect.  When under the influence of
<br>
a psychedelic, one files away experiences and learns from them, much as one
<br>
would in any other conscious state.  So it is not surprising that the
<br>
things one learned (illusory or not, useful or not) return to consciousness
<br>
when triggered by the same stimuli which originally elicited them.
<br>
<p>Over the longer term I have found that there is a closer coupling of my
<br>
&quot;sober&quot; and &quot;psychedelic&quot; states of consciousness.  As a less experienced
<br>
tripper I was less able to discern potentially useful insights from those
<br>
that would make little sense when the drug wore off.  I was also less able
<br>
to bring useful meta-programming out of the psychedelic trip and into
<br>
effect in my everyday existence.  I feel that time and experience have
<br>
honed both of these skills.
<br>
<p>regards,
<br>
