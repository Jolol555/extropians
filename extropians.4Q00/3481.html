Actually, I'm not talking about libertarian theory, I'm more discussing how we
<br>
might get things we want (cloning research, nanotech, genetic engineering) when
<br>
most of society doesn't care, is opposed, etc. (Also, part of it has to do with
<br>
how you define legitimate, actually. A lot of people consider legitimate things
<br>
which I don't, and they couldn't care less about whether I like it, as long as
<br>
they get it)

<em>&gt;Subject: Re: Random comments on some late discussions.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;HUH?  Call me a simpleton but I thought Libertarianism was about people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doing it their way wherever that does not infringe on the rights of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others to do the same.  The above seems to assume that a lot of people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;legitimate interests are in conflict much of the time.
</em><br>
<p>Re-structuring government is forcing people to live under your system, if a
<br>
large number of them don't want it. A limited-function libertarian government is
<br>
not what most people want, or we'd have it, and were we to get it over their
<br>
opposition, we'd be forcing them to live under a system they don't agree with.
<br>
Now, the point then is, what do we do? We can tell people government is
<br>
initiating force by making us pay taxes, but they largely don't agree. Giving
<br>
them facts, reasons, etc. won't matter, since their values aren't ours, and they
<br>
aren't going to connect things as we do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Again, &quot;make them do it anyway&quot; is no part of what I thought Libertarianism was
</em><br>
about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this and other things you've said, I can tell you're a fan of Ayn Rand,
</em><br>
maybe even an objectivist. (I'm trying not to make a definitive statement, on
<br>
purpose. I'm also trying to illustrate a point, rather than this being a
<br>
personal attack). I read everything of hers I could find (except We, the Living)
<br>
when I was 20. However, now, I don't like her work nearly as much, it strikes me
<br>
as too simplistic. So, I have to make myself not turn off what you're saying.
<br>
Why? Because almost every objectivist I've met comes off sounding like a
<br>
religious fundamentalist. For example, I once took a FAQ on capitalism from an
<br>
objectivist web page. I then replaced the word capitalism with the word Jesus,
<br>
and then read the parts which describe capitalism's benefits (making sure not to
<br>
read the parts which mentioned specifically economic ideas) to some friends. ALL
<br>
of them thought I was reading a religious tract.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why bring this up? Most people will shut you out if they think you're an
<br>
ideologue, and we get nowhere. Despite libertarian theory, we live in a world
<br>
where most people don't agree with us, and we get nothing done telling them
<br>
they're not bright enough to understand how much we know. Telling them they've
<br>
stolen the food they're eating, when it came from government, is going to get
<br>
them to mark you as a nut, and you get nowhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The main parties have not dared mention or name their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fundamental principles for some time now.  There is a great emptiness in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American politics waiting to be filled.
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually, one person DID say people were stupid. It's what got me started on
<br>
this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It would be arrogant to say (not that anyone here has directly) that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people are simply too dumb to be interested or to understand a platform
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speaking of and build firmly on sound principles.
