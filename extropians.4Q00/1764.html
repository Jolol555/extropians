<p><em>&gt;  When asked most people would prefer having completed an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;onerous task last week over having to perform one this evening; they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would prefer a pleasurable meal this evening to one ten years ago; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they would prefer to be leaving on vacation to returning to work when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their vacation is over.
</em><br>
<p>I find this a nonsensical concept.  Preferences for past actions have no 
<br>
meaning,
<br>
as you can't undo them.  I am no longer able to choose to not eat that meal
<br>
ten years ago.  The value of regret is that it may instruct you to do 
<br>
something differently now, but the basis of the change is new information,
<br>
not simply the fact that the pleasure was long ago.
