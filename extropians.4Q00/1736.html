The two Blackhawks lost in Somalia were both taken down by tail shots
<br>
with RPG-7s. Strictly rocket science, Doug. :)
<br>
<p>Got any ideas for a simple propulsion system that's a cheap as a
<br>
Panzerfaust but has the exhaust plume and signature of a Carl Gustav?
<br>
(see <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/Quarters/2116/carlgustav.htm">http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/Quarters/2116/carlgustav.htm</a> for
<br>
some background)
<br>
<p>Longer range does mean guidance. Guidance, where needed, could best
<br>
(cheapest incremental bang for buck) be handled via wire (fiber)
<br>
guidance and television, provided one has enough cruise time to permit
<br>
launch from defilade with dogleg maneuvering. Autonomous guidance
<br>
systems start to have classic AI problems, as the ways to defeat the
<br>
classic Sidewinder and Sparrow are fairly well known. Cruise missiles
<br>
and other less-unstealthy delivery might be another matter.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure how I'd feel about having a really *good* AI in a Kamikaze
<br>
role. But I had fun when I ran *my* simulated wire guided TOWs right
<br>
under the wheels of those video BMPs (:)).
<br>
<p>BTW, I have heard a rumor the chickens didn't respond at all well to
<br>
pre-drop ack ack. Could be just a story.
