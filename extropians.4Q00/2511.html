</em><br>
<p>I would say that 45 minutes of strongly aerobic exercise five times a week 
<br>
is excessive. I think you can get virtually the same health benefit from 
<br>
around 25 minutes four times a week, with far less free radical formation.
<br>
<p>As for building muscle mass -- certainly excessive bodybuilding is not 
<br>
optimal for health, especially if the bodybuilder is using steroids in 
<br>
their current form to grow muscle tissue without regard to side-effects. 
<br>
But I've found that people are relatively unaware of the benefits of 
<br>
weight-training as compared to aerobic exercise. It is most definitely not 
<br>
all a matter of appearance.
<br>
<p>Weight-training/bodybuilding when done sensibly improves glucose metabolism 
<br>
and insulin response, lowers blood sugar (=less glycosylation) and reduces 
<br>
risk of diseases (including diabetes), maintains or restores bone mass 
<br>
(very important as you age, *especially* for women reaching menopause), and 
<br>
improves the sense of well-being (more than aerobic exercise).
<br>
<p>Beyond those benefits, others will be more relative to the individual. Here 
<br>
I would include how healthy, powerful, and vigorous you look. Some of us 
<br>
like to sculpt our bodies, others see them as mere vehicles of no aesthetic 
<br>
interest.
<br>
<p>Improved physical strength may save your life in some circumstances and is 
<br>
useful in many more situations. Given that caloric restriction with good 
<br>
nutrition is life-extending, muscle building has the extremely important 
<br>
benefit of giving you tissue to burn in an emergency if you don't have the 
<br>
fat. I've seen friends lose 30-50 lbs very quickly in hospital. If you're 
<br>
calorically restricted and have neither body fat nor muscle tissue, a 
<br>
medical emergency could just kill you.
<br>
<p>Remember that I'm not recommending two hour workouts daily. That would 
<br>
indeed mean unnecessary free radical formation. You can get tremendous 
<br>
health benefits from shorter, focused workouts. (Mine are 30-40 minutes, 
<br>
including plenty of rest between sets. But when I do a set, I'm working at 
<br>
peak capacity.)
<br>
<p>Onward!
