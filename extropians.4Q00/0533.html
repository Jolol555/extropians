</em><br>
<em>&gt;that men who consider themselves gay have had sex with more women then have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;men who consider themselves straight, but (obviously) the number of sexual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;encounters with the opposite sex would be much less. So if this were true, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the evolutionary benefit is easier to figure out, but why would it be like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this? Can anyone think of reasons why a homosexual would actually lead to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more heterosexual partners then a heterosexual? 
</em><br>
<p>I posted a hypothesis here relating to this some years ago.  Basically, humans
<br>
are unusual in that a great deal of our sexual selection cues are learned.  We
<br>
do like other people with bumps in the right places, but we are also attracted
<br>
to good singing, witty conversation, stylish clothes, fascinating music 
<br>
collections,
<br>
etc.  So it would benefit us to pay more attention to the sexually attractive
<br>
of our own sex, to learn how to attract the opposite.
<br>
<p>One obvious way for genes to induce us to pay more attention to attractive
<br>
members of our sex is to turn on the attraction mechanisms normally on
<br>
in the other sex.  Normal humans carry all the genes for both sexes, except
<br>
for one maleness switch gene absent in women because it's on the Y 
<br>
chromosome.  The genes that produce the physical and psychological charac-
<br>
teristics of the other sex are just off, or at least less active.  It would
<br>
be an evolutionarily easy process for some of the off switches relating to
<br>
sexual attraction drives to get leaky.  Some sexual activity with the same
<br>
sex is no problem at all for the genes, as long as on average they produce
<br>
more reproductive sexual activity, or activity with more desirable people.
<br>
<p>By my hypothesis, the &quot;optimal&quot; phenotype would presumably be bisexual.
<br>
Purely straight people would be, on average, less able to make themselves
<br>
desirable; purely gay people would not bother to take advantage of their
<br>
desirability to the opposite sex.  I think it's unlikely that purely 
<br>
homosexual 
<br>
orientation is genetically advantageous because otherwise it'd be more common.
<br>
<p>I can also hypothesize a gene-meme coevolutionary reason for why most
<br>
cultures disapprove of homosexuality.  A meme inducing its carriers to
<br>
refrain from sexual activity with the same sex would presumably produce
<br>
more desire for activity with the opposite sex.  If the carriers still *want*
<br>
it with the same sex, then they'll still pay attention, and still derive the 
<br>
desirability advantages.  The carriers may be miserable, but that's not the
<br>
meme's or the gene's problem.  If the meme is often transmitted vertically
<br>
(which includes most religions) then it derives a transmission benefit and
<br>
tends to spread.
<br>
<p>Just as a meme suppressed same-sex activity without suppressing same-
<br>
sex desire can be selectively favored, a gene with similar effects could too.
<br>
The homophobic indeed tend to be aroused by same-sex erotica more than the 
<br>
population in general.  I think there's a strong genetic component to homo-
<br>
phobia just as there is to homosexuality.
