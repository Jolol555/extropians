<em>&gt; It seems to me you have an adroit and accurate perception of what it takes for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military unit to function effectively (as &quot;the species' immune system&quot; as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were). Looking at it in this way, it seems we have a use for military force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then again, perhaps we can transcend violence. What do you think?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure. Claims of archaeologists et al indicate that primitive homo
<br>
sapiens was actually higher in intelligence, on average, than his later, more
<br>
civilized bretheren, as idiots got killed off quickly in the wild. Primitive
<br>
does not mean stupid. Once man developed agricultural society, his diet suffered
<br>
significantly, impacting life expectancy, average intelligence, etc., while
<br>
retarding evolutionary pressures to weed out low IQ individuals. Improvements in
<br>
diets this past century is generally credited with the increase in IQ commented
<br>
on this list. There has also been a concurrent increase in violence, on both a
<br>
wholesale and retail basis. I don't know if this can be attributed to a rise in
<br>
IQ, dietary improvements, or due to economic and population pressures, ethnic
<br>
intermixing, etc.
<br>
<p>It may not be a linear or asmptotic effect, but more of a bell curve effect as
<br>
is seen in things like population growth versus education or standard of living,
<br>
or per capita pollution versus standard of living. These things are a bit beyond
<br>
my own research, so I leave it as an exercise to the reader...
