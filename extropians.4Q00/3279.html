<em>&gt; &gt; Life extension really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't change much of anything except duration- every entity will still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perish at some time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really?  Are you sure?  If that time can be put off and put off over and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over again and one gets better and better about handling all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contigencies and having backups of one's self in case of mishap, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you get a lot closer over time to &quot;and then you die&quot; not being so.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not clear that even the heat-death of the universe will necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end it.  It looks so now, from here, but I will not take bets that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not eventually see even this ultimate trump beat.
</em><br>
<p>A backup would just be a copy- your consciousness would be gone forever.
<br>
I'm not interested in &quot;backing myself up&quot;, having my brain scanned into a
<br>
computer, or copied into a different body- the minute my current brain goes
<br>
offline, I'm gone- only an I that is not I would remain.  Every evolutionary
<br>
step in history has lead to an increase in longevity- but not immortality.
<br>
Stardust didn't organize itself into a human being overnight, no matter what
<br>
any scripture might say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So as long as accidents are possible you are saying that not dying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except by such unforeseen and unprepared for accident is simply not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good thing?  Or not good enough for you to be particularly interested?
</em><br>
<p>No.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against life extension.  I just
<br>
don't believe in immortalism- and many of the immortalist scenarios I've
<br>
read offer little appeal to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe so, but so what?  Would you rather stay on this size of stage you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are on now for these few short years followed by oblivion or expand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage and the time, perhaps enough to find real answers to whatever it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is you seek?
</em><br>
<p>Certainly- I plan to make use of any technology that comes along that can
<br>
potentially extend my lifespan without destroying my true self.  I'll make
<br>
use of any nanotech devices or longevity treatments that come along, barring
<br>
the destruction of my body or brain.  I'm not going to download myself,
<br>
however- I like having a body, and, until the tech is availiable for me to
<br>
transmute myself into other forms, I'll keep it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does this somehow comfort you or are you somehow confronting us with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something you think is for our own good or what?
</em><br>
<p>No- it's just the truth.  In the long run, we're dead.  It doesn't really
<br>
comfort me- how could the idea of dissolution possibly comfort an egomaniac?
<br>
I just don't see any point in a lifespan extended beyond a few millenia...
<br>
but this is subject to change.  I don't have to worry about this until 4000
<br>
CE.
<br>
<p>(Who knows, maybe I'll take up a life of crime... there are lots of laws to
<br>
break... the laws of thermodynamics... Leibniz's law...)
<br>
<p>-Nicq MacDonald
<br>
<p>&quot;We do progress, but how?  Not by the tinkering of the meliorist; not by the
<br>
crushing of initiative; not by laws and regulations which hamstring the
<br>
racehorse, and handcuff the boxer; but by the innovations of the eccentric,
<br>
by the phantasies of the hashish-dreamer of philosophy, by the aspirations
<br>
of the idealist to the impossible, by the imagination of the revolutionary,
<br>
by the perilous adventure of the pioneer.  Progress is by leaps and bounds,
<br>
by breaking from custom, by working on untried experiments; in short, by the
<br>
follies and crimes of men of genius, only recognizable as wisdom and virtue
<br>
after they have been tortured to death, and their murderers reap gloatingly
<br>
the harvest of the seeds they sowed at midnight.&quot; -Aleister Crowley, &quot;On
<br>
Original Sin&quot;
