I misspoke. His comment was regarding HTML, not the Web.

Search for the section headed
<br>
TWO CHEERS FOR THE WORLD WIDE WEB
<br>
in it you will find:
<br>
&quot;The Web is a foam of ever-popping bubbles, ever-changing shopwindows. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The Web is the minimal concession to hypertext that a
<br>
sequence-and-hierarchy chauvinist could possibly make....
<br>
<p>&quot;The Xanadu® project did not 'fail to invent HTML'.  HTML is precisely
<br>
what we were trying to PREVENT-- ever-breaking links, links going
<br>
outward only, quotes you can't follow to their origins, no version
<br>
management, no rights management.&quot;
