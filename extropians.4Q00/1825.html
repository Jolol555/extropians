</em><br>
<em>&gt;Are you saying that the reason you can't change the future is because of

</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Or are there other reasons you can't literally change the future?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For example, in a deterministic universe there is a sense in which you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can't change the future, because you can't make any choices, they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pre-ordained.  Is this the kind of thing you mean?
</em><br>
<p>I have in mind the standard relativistic view of space-time as a singular
<br>
always existing whole.  The standard view presented in a course on general
<br>
relativity, for example, or in a published paper analyzing time machines.
<br>
Even in a non-deterministic universe, if there aren't mystical &quot;free-will&quot;
<br>
demons acting from without, an agent making a choice is really just
<br>
discovering what the future is.
