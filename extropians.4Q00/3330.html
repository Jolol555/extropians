<p>
Just one point regarding information.
<br>
I don´t think about information in terms of freedom or power. I just believe
<br>
that the future of information is a personalized one, with no limits in its
<br>
extension, and with endless power. An intelligent agent in our computer will
<br>
do the work for us, after we´ve decided which information we exactly want.
<br>
And a little bit later, he´ll learn by himself, studying our habits, what do
<br>
we want.
<br>
No problem if we change habits. The algorithms introduced in its software
<br>
will allow him to catch, in real time, our new preferences.
<br>
My bet goes for intelligent agents software, as powerful AND free as you can
<br>
imagine.
<br>
A different thing is that we´ll have to pay for certain information and
<br>
certain access for the future global intelligent Internet.
<br>
So lets try to build it with all our efforts, at least from those who'd like
<br>
to be in the fast train.
<br>
What about the people that don't believe or try to develop that kind of
<br>
technologies in the very near future, even present?. Just unplugged...
<br>
Greetings for every extrop.
<br>
D.

Your
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; direct equation of &quot;power&quot; with &quot;freeness&quot; is simplisitic.  Does money
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; control/limits we place on it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did not make a simplistic association.  I do not speak a vague
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generality.  I am speaking of information and only of information, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of money.  Please keep on topic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Laws of scarcity.  Maybe you think it would be nice if every kid on
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planet could have a mint copy of Action Comics #1, but you can't
</em><br>
argue
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such a distribution wouldn't destroy an interesting market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Irrelevant to the discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Only if you haven't been paying attention, or are unaware of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transformation of creative energy into replicable data prevalent in
</em><br>
today's
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; media environment.  If 'collectibility' is an asset worth protecting in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; material world, why isn't it in the electronic one?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Irrelevant because there is one and only one of those actual physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; items.  I am not speaking of actual physical items but of information,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of bits.  That is the difference as I pointed out in my previous post.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dragging an actual physical item in to make your point is a mistake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   A first edition is a material artifact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It is not information but a given physical embodiment in a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; form produced at a particular time.  It cannot be duplicated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; definition.  But every kid can have a copy of the contents of that
</em><br>
first
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; edition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes Samantha, and think very carefully about what that &quot;definition&quot; is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did.  Do you have something to add?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Here, allow me: we have arbitrarily placed value upon a particular
</em><br>
edition
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a magazine.  Although the technology exists to create a nearly exact
</em><br>
(for
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all practical intents and purposes) duplicate, we have passed laws
</em><br>
against
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any attempt to pass such a forgery off as a first edition.  Essentially
</em><br>
we
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have decided to outlaw the replication of a particular print run of
</em><br>
material
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; goods, despite the fact that we could easily put an accurate forgery in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hand of every elementary school kid on the planet.  We do that to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (arbitrarily) protect a market-- and as a result, there is one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This does not work.  A duplicate is a duplicate and in the world of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collectibles can never be worth what the original is.  Again, please get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of examples that have nothing to do with what I am talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes there is a place for secrets - in war or the equivalent, one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; personal information and affairs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's not the position of the post to which I replied:  Zero Powers
</em><br>
wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;I personally think those who demand the perpetuation of personal
</em><br>
&quot;privacy&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a future that will live and breath on the unrestricted communication
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processing of ever increasing amounts of information are unknowing
</em><br>
Luddites.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As I see it our ultimate &quot;purpose,&quot; if there is one, is to facillitate
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; efficient storage, transmission and processing of data.  Everything at
</em><br>
its
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; core is information and the more of it we can grasp and utilize, the
</em><br>
better
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; off we will be.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   But in peace and in non-personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; information, the maximal power and good of each of us is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; dependent on the free flow of information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Again, total disagreement.  It's not just about free flow of
</em><br>
information,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (isn't that obvious?) it's about access to the right information.
</em><br>
Further,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you specifically use the term 'each of us' referring to individuals:
</em><br>
can't
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you think of a few (thousand) ways in which the maximal power and good
</em><br>
of an
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individual is highly dependent on the controlled flow of information?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are speaking at cross purposes.  I suggest we both take a breather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and reset.
