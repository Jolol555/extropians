If I was 20-some instead of 40-some what would I major in and/or do as a
<br>
career?  There is a very good chance that I would do Computer Science
<br>
much as I did decide to do.  Although if I had it to do over I would
<br>
have hung out in academia longer.  But I was in too much of a hurry to
<br>
build cool real-world stuff.  Even if I was of much the same
<br>
disposition  and younger now I would steer that desire toward building
<br>
AI principally with a strong emphasis on GA and cognitive science.
<br>
<p>With nanotech as hot as it is now I would take a lot deeper
<br>
concentration in physics, biology, molecular biology, chemistry, of
<br>
course all the math I can grok and so on.  I would look for a research
<br>
position in some lab, commercial, academic or privately funded doing at
<br>
least entry level relevant work.  
<br>
<p>Another strong draw would be to the sociological implications of the
<br>
approaching singularity and to design of the type of world we would like
<br>
to get to or at least finding ways to sketch/image ideas in that
<br>
direction it so people could think about it more thoroughly.  A course
<br>
in psychology toward understanding practical memetics would be a
<br>
definite possibility.
<br>
<p>So, in short, I would study a lot of stuff and look for a way to become
<br>
a player for money or not as quickly as I could but not so quickly as to
<br>
not build a firm grasp of the subject.  
<br>
<p>If I was of a mind I would start or at least design some business plans
<br>
of things coming up next.  
<br>
<p>I'm starting to think that the hottest next thing (&lt; 2 years before it
<br>
explodes) is PDAs on steroids =&gt; practical, ubiquitous wearable
<br>
computers and massively available personalized computer access and
<br>
services.  This will enable a level of human computer support and
<br>
extension that will be impossible not to have if you want to be
<br>
competitive a few slim years hence.  It is a very interesting field full
<br>
of challenges and wonderful possibilities.  It will make a real
<br>
difference in raising the effective IQ.
