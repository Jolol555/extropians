<p>There seemed to be a dualism at work. Many career university types were
<br>
committed to preventing any sort of 'commercialization' of the internet,
<br>
naively thinking that the internet would maintain a high signal to noise
<br>
ratio no matter how many people were on it through self governance, and
<br>
that it would make more people better thinkers and more intelligent as a
<br>
result. We can of course now laugh at such naivete. On the other hand,
<br>
you had military contractor types on the net who saw the commercial
<br>
potential but could do nothing while DARPA was paying the bills and the
<br>
university 'pinheads' dominated the traffic (and who were a linchpin in
<br>
the R&amp;D of their own businesses). As more industry engineering types got
<br>
on the net, things shifted to a more right libertarian gestalt until
<br>
eventually those two lawyers committed the first act of commercial spam,
<br>
and all hell broke loose.
