<p><em>&gt;      OK.  Fair enough.  I can live with that.  I just wish that it had said

</em><br>
<p><p>Yeah, small personal things.  Like perhaps immortality if we get a move
<br>
on and don't die to something stupid like the march of the luddites. 
<br>
Little things like ending scarcity of most material things in our
<br>
lifetime, vastly increasing intelligence, freedom from the gravity well,
<br>
brains enough not to suck up hours on easy question, that sort of stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      You may be right for all I know.  After all, I joined the ExI primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I agree with just about everything it stands for.  Unfortunately, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt that the ExI will make much of a difference over here in the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowing that I support the forces of good is really all that you get out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ExI membership, it is not for me.  If I were rich I might consider it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but as it is, yes, I do like to get a least something back for my money.
</em><br>
<p>It is not for those with small minds and smaller vision.
