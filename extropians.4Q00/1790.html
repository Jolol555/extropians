[Non-member submission]
<br>
<p>Extropians,
<br>
<p>Good to see so much discussion spawned on the
<br>
topic of firearms on these 2 lists (I'm copying
<br>
exi-bay, which, like it or not, seems to have
<br>
an active a non-announcement thread running
<br>
at the moment).
<br>
<p>I'd simply like to add that I've been to a number
<br>
of shooting schools, some several times, and am
<br>
greatly impressed with Front Sight's approach to
<br>
training.  I, like Will, am an
<br>
all-you-can-eat-training
<br>
life member of the school.  You'll find us there
<br>
most months.  If any of you are genuinely interested
<br>
in training, we're likely to be there and can
<br>
assist you over issues of logistics and such.
<br>
I'm glad to help: it's good to see extropians
<br>
gain skill at arms.
<br>
<p>I'm one of the old-time extropians who adheres to
<br>
the intended, well-articulated meaning of the word
<br>
&quot;extropian&quot;, which _requires_ libertarianism.  I've
<br>
long thought of real extropians as being different
<br>
from armchair libertarians, in that extropians
<br>
_work_ to make something more of themselves as
<br>
individuals.
<br>
<p>In this context - discussion of martial skill -
<br>
I take this to mean that extropians recognize,
<br>
in the words of L. Neil Smith, &quot;... self-defense is a
<br>
bodily function which cannot be delegated to another
<br>
individual or group...&quot; (see
<br>
&quot;<a href="http://www.webleyweb.com/lneil/arizona.html">http://www.webleyweb.com/lneil/arizona.html</a>&quot;).
<br>
<p>This means being serious about self-defense:
<br>
acquiring weapons and _learning how to use
<br>
them effectively_.
<br>
<p>I would also recommend that extropians consider
<br>
training in a very broad-based martial art such
<br>
as the one I practice, Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu.
<br>
A good place to familiarize yourself with some
<br>
of the bujinkan approach is my San Francisco
<br>
teacher Dale Seago's website:
<br>
&quot;<a href="http://www.bujinkansf.org/">http://www.bujinkansf.org/</a>&quot;.
<br>
<p>There's also a dojo in Sunnyvale run by my good
<br>
friend, the excellent Mike Kelley:
<br>
&quot;<a href="http://www.seiryudojo.com/">http://www.seiryudojo.com/</a>&quot;
<br>
<p>I would be happy to show any of you to those dojos
<br>
when I'm in the Bay area (and not in Reno).  Much
<br>
of the body movement you'll learn in the Bujinkan
<br>
will make you a better pistolero or rifleman.  Our
<br>
firearms retention approach, for example, is
<br>
vastly more sophisticated than the brute force
<br>
techniques taught to police and soldiers.
<br>
<p>Back to the libertarianism subthread, I'm not
<br>
interested in disputing those newbies who've
<br>
not done their historical research.  For those
<br>
who are interested in reading good polemics on
<br>
the connection between firearms and freedom,
<br>
read John Ross' &quot;Unintended Consequences&quot;, the
<br>
&quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; of the new freedom movement
<br>
(&quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1888118040/o/qid=972940505/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/104-1816499-7542319">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1888118040/o/qid=972940505/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/104-1816499-7542319</a>&quot;),
<br>
and the works of L. Neil Smith (quoted
<br>
above; traverse the links from that page, there's
<br>
plenty there).
<br>
<p>DVC (look that up),
