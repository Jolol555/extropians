I finished &quot;Living To 100&quot; last week, and just wanted to conclude
<br>
my comments on this excellent book with a story from it.
<br>
<p>A psychologist brought a centenarian to her class to be interviewed
<br>
by her students. One of the things they most wanted to know was if
<br>
she could be any age, what age would she choose?
<br>
<p>She surprised (startled) the class by answering 70. When asked to
<br>
explain she remarked that what she wanted most was to see her
<br>
great-grandchildren grow up, and 20 year olds don't have great
<br>
grandchildren.
<br>
<p>The point was that these centenarians were happy with their lives,
<br>
and just wanted more of it.
<br>
<p>Now that's what I call a lesson.....
