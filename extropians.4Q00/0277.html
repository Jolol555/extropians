<p><em>&gt; The &quot;rules of the environment&quot; is an interesting idea. You could build an

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; not. If not, then the environment surely a prison. If the person has admin,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; applicable whilst the person wishes them to be.
</em><br>
<p>Probably for an environment to be at all coherent only a relatively few
<br>
people could have admin privileges.  Your freedom would be to go to
<br>
another environment and take whatever you had gained locally that was
<br>
portable with you or gain some admin privileges within limits of not
<br>
breaking the environment too seriously. Being in an environment without
<br>
admin privilege is no more of a &quot;prison&quot; that being here and now.  Much
<br>
less of a prison since I can freely go elsewhere where I can't now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This leads to the conclusion that these environments must either have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top level rules larger than and beyond the reach of the contained entities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (thus prisons), or that the environments could hold no real interest or sway
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over members for more than trivial time, unless those contained entities are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vapid escapists who choose that the rules bind them indefinitely, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than deal with the rest of the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Your prison conclusion is mistaken.  It is simply an agreement to work
<br>
with a set of structured parameters and possibilities for a time. 
<br>
Different environments might be specialized for different types of
<br>
activities and needs.  For instance, Topological Reasoning environments
<br>
(a la Diaspora) or an environment specially tuned to musical
<br>
expressions.  Other environments might simply be ones where a group of
<br>
reasonably compatible entities agree to a set of working rules and
<br>
environment characteristics that leads to a pleasingly harmonious (or
<br>
not) place for them to hang out and share/compete/whatever in. 
<br>
<p>No one deals with all the universe all of the time.  Things like home
<br>
bases, spciality being/view places and so on have value without being
<br>
&quot;escapes&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The only environment which doesn't hold to this analysis is the &quot;real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world&quot;, the physical universe, and only given that it's laws are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictated by a sentient (otherwise it classes as a prison, as above).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What is the &quot;real world&quot;?  A set of informational equations running in
<br>
3-1 space that we happened to have had our beginnings as entities in? 
<br>
Isn't it perhaps a bit earlier to be certain that this space is more
<br>
&quot;real&quot; than any and all others?  What if we found this space is a
<br>
consequent or even a VR within another space?  A very old idea true
<br>
enough.  Again, Diaspora had some interesting suggestive things along
<br>
these lines.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For the crims and a special hypothetical environment that is just a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Doom&quot;, well, the problem is there is zero opportunity to learn to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a less violent environment. There are no repercussions and no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incentives (beyond hopefully eventual boredom).  There may well be such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environments but I doubt they would be useful for anything but certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; types of &quot;entertainment&quot;.  This may mark me as really odd but personally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't have any use for environments where people frag other people for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fun.  I realize that some people do.  To me that makes them odd.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; heh, it takes all kinds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why should anyone learn if they don't want to? The only reason to force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning on others is to help ensure they respect a shared environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better. The context in which the &quot;doom&quot; environment was proposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (non-seriously) was one in which you don't have to share if you don't feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like it (unlikely, to be sure). In such an environment, prisons make no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense, except if your goal is power over others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>They don't &quot;have to&quot; until they simply get bored shitless with the same
<br>
ole thing and want something different.
