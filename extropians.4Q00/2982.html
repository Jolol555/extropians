Copy pasted this from some obscure node on the 'net =]
<br>
<p><p><p>--------
<br>
<p>In 1894, Congress adopted an income tax act which was declared 
<br>
unconstitutional in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429, 15 
<br>
S.Ct. 673, aff. reh., 158 U.S. 601, 15 S.Ct. 912 (1895). The Pollock Court 
<br>
found that the income tax was a direct tax which could only be imposed if 
<br>
the tax was apportioned; since this tax was not apportioned, it was found 
<br>
unconstitutional. In an effort to circumvent this decision, the 16th 
<br>
Amendment was proposed by Congress in 1909 and allegedly ratified by the 
<br>
states in 1913. As a result, various opinions arose regarding the legal 
<br>
effect of the amendment. Some factions contended that the 16th Amendment 
<br>
simply eliminated the apportionment requirement for one specific direct tax 
<br>
known as the income tax, while others asserted that the amendment simply 
<br>
withdrew it from the direct tax category and placed the income tax in the 
<br>
indirect, excise tax class. These competing contentions and interpretations 
<br>
were apparently resolved in Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 240 
<br>
U.S. 1, 36 S.Ct. 236 (1916).[1] Rather than attempt a determination of what 
<br>
the Court held in this case, it is more important to learn what various 
<br>
courts have subsequently declared Brushaber to mean.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little more than a week after the opinion in Brushaber, similar issues 
<br>
were present for decision in Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., 240 U.S. 103, 
<br>
112-13, 36 S.Ct. 278 (1916), which involved the question of whether an 
<br>
inadequate depletion allowance for a mining company constituted a direct tax 
<br>
on the company's property. As to Baltic's contention that &quot;the 16th 
<br>
Amendment authorized only an exceptional direct income tax without 
<br>
apportionment,&quot; the Court rejected it by stating that this contention:
<br>
<p>&quot;... manifestly disregards the fact that by the previous ruling it was 
<br>
settled that the provisions of the 16th Amendment conferred no new power of 
<br>
taxation, but simply prohibited the previous complete and plenary power of 
<br>
income taxation possessed by Congress from the beginning from being taken 
<br>
out of the category of indirect taxation to which it inherently belonged, 
<br>
and being placed in the category of direct taxation.&quot;
<br>
The Court clearly held that income taxes inherently belonged to the 
<br>
indirect/excise tax class, but had been converted by Pollock to direct taxes 
<br>
by considering the source of the income; the 16th Amendment merely banished 
<br>
the rule in Pollock. See also Tyee Realty Co. v. Anderson, 240 U.S. 115, 36 
<br>
S.Ct. 281 (1916), decided the same day.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the victory of defining what the 16th Amendment meant was short 
<br>
lived and later decisions commenced a course which appears to have changed 
<br>
the meaning of Brushaber, or at least provided fertile grounds for an 
<br>
entirely different and opposite construction of it. In William E. Peck and 
<br>
Co. v. Lowe, 247 U.S. 165, 172-73, 38 S.Ct. 432, 433 (1918), which involved 
<br>
a tax imposed on export earnings, the Court seemed to indicate that what was 
<br>
accomplished by the amendment was the elimination of the apportionment 
<br>
requirement for the direct tax known as the income tax, an argument rejected 
<br>
in Baltic:
<br>
<p>&quot;The Sixteenth Amendment, although referred to in argument, has no real 
<br>
bearing and may be put out of view. As pointed out in recent decisions, it 
<br>
does not extend the taxing power to new or excepted subjects, but merely 
<br>
removed all occasion, which otherwise might exist, for an apportionment 
<br>
among the states of taxes laid on income, whether it be derived from one 
<br>
source or another.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drift away from the position of the Court that the income tax via 
<br>
the 16th Amendment fell within the excise tax category became more 
<br>
pronounced with the decision in Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189, 206, 40 
<br>
S.Ct. 189 (1920), which involved the application of this tax to a stock 
<br>
dividend. Here, the Court plainly stated what many lawyers and some judges 
<br>
today think was accomplished by means of this amendment: the elimination of 
<br>
the apportionment requirement for the direct tax known as the income tax. In 
<br>
deciding this case, the Court quoted the amendment and then redeclared its 
<br>
meaning:
<br>
&quot;As repeatedly held, this did not extend the taxing power to new subjects, 
<br>
but merely removed the necessity which otherwise might exist for an 
<br>
apportionment among the states of taxes laid on income. Brushaber....,&quot; 252 
<br>
U.S., at 206.
<br>
&quot;A proper regard for its genesis, as well as its very clear language, 
<br>
requires also that this amendment shall not be extended by loose 
<br>
construction, so as to repeal or modify, except as applied to income, those 
<br>
provisions of the Constitution that require an apportionment according to 
<br>
population for direct taxes upon property, real and personal.&quot;
<br>
<p>Is this the resurfacing of the argument that &quot;the 16th Amendment authorized 
<br>
only an exceptional direct income tax without apportionment&quot; condemned in 
<br>
Baltic?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a study of Brushaber, it is thus possible for someone to rely upon 
<br>
those portions of the two phrases at the beginning and ending of 240 U.S. 19 
<br>
to believe that &quot;the 16th Amendment authorized only an exceptional direct 
<br>
income tax without apportionment.&quot; If one fell into that error, this belief 
<br>
would be magnified by the above highlighted portions of Eisner. Confusion 
<br>
abounds as to the correct interpretation of Brushaber, and this is obvious 
<br>
because various courts of this nation have relied upon this line of 
<br>
authority to reach diametrically opposing results.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state courts have been particularly split over the nature of an 
<br>
income tax and whether it constitutes a direct property tax or an 
<br>
indirect/excise, which is not imposed on property.
