<em>&gt; I think that you're assuming that since you don't understand how

</em><br>
<p>I assume that you are assuming assumptions. When you assume, you make an
<br>
&quot;ass&quot; of &quot;u&quot; and &quot;me&quot;, don't you know? Or I assume so, in any case.
<br>
<p>What's a computer engineer? Is that a dude that designs hardware? Or is it a
<br>
fancy name for cable monkey?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, you can stop a running process and store it as information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you think happens when you put most laptops to sleep?  All of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the relevant processes running are swapped out to disk along with
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; registers and caches of the CPU and any relevant I/O device.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You could remove the hard drive from that first machine and duplicate
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in identical laptops and &quot;wake&quot; them.  They would both be running all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same programs you were - all at the same point of execution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points as when you put them to sleep.  Which was the original?  Who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cares?
</em><br>
<p>This is where the metaphor of Consciousness is Computer Process falls down.
<br>
Of course, a process can be swapped out and in (and is routinely, under a
<br>
multiprocessing OS), switching from a running &quot;thing&quot; to information and
<br>
back again. The external observer cares not at all about these interruptions
<br>
to the processes' &quot;continuous identity&quot;; it makes no functional difference.
<br>
<p>Also, the process itself cares not a whit, because it has no means to; it is
<br>
not conscious, after all, so how could the concept of caring mean anything?
<br>
<p>However, a conscious being is another kettle of fish. Being swapped in and
<br>
out may be a problem for a conscious being; interesting ramifications for
<br>
hardware &amp; OS design for upload sim environments.
<br>
<p>I am contending that consciousness is not information; it's a thing that
<br>
exists in some way. A process in a computer is not information; its a stream
<br>
of activity undertaken by a physical machine. It is very closely described
<br>
by information; a dump of the contents of the memory that it is using, the
<br>
registers, OS tables of IO states, etc. However, it is not that description,
<br>
and it is not the file or process table entry or whatever, that is stored
<br>
while it is swapped out. It is not even the contents of it's memory
<br>
addresses and the registers, and all that guff, while it is running; it is
<br>
the actual things being done while it is running, as a result of those
<br>
contents. Atoms flowing around, gates doing gatey stuff, hardrives whizzing,
<br>
stuff happening. Not information.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assuming that human beings are just biological computers, it should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually be possible to use the same techniques once we work out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of the neurochemical details.
</em><br>
<p>Undoubtedly this is possible, undoubtedly this will work, especially from
<br>
the point of view of the engineers &amp; admins building and running such
<br>
systems (ie: from the outside). What will the subjective experience be for
<br>
those so encoded, however?
