<em>&gt;This reminds me of an Edelman story. Apparently the science department was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in trouble because it had such a huge expense account. The math department
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bragged that it only needed chalk, paper, and a few waste paper baskets.
</em><br>
But
<br>
<em>&gt;the philosophy department did even better. They didn't even need waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt;baskets. Get it? The philosophers didn't throw out their wrong questions.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Why did you use the math department as an example of empirical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;research?  Math is based on logic, classification systems,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consistency, nomenclature, conclusions, extrapolations, etc.  Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;math is derived philosophically and logically.  It is only proved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;later by science empirically.
</em><br>
<p>Didn't Russell and Whitehead show that 'logic' supplied the
<br>
rules underlying both mathematics and language in Principia
<br>
Mathematica ... maths is purely logically, and cannot be
<br>
&quot;proven by science empirically.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Einstein's E=MC^2 was a philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argument until science proved it later.
</em><br>
<p>This a claim from Physics, not algebra ... or academic
<br>
philosophy come to that.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Imaginary numbers were a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophical &quot;what-if&quot; argument that extended the rules, until
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physics and electricity confirmed them later.  Negative numbers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the concept of &quot;zero&quot; were abstractions demanded by philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;logic and debate.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree .... they became agreed conventions because of
<br>
their UTILITY in practice .. solving problems.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;They were not discovered or empirically proven.
</em><br>
<p>No, see above, mathematics IS a subset of logic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It seems to me that all theory is philosophy, and the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;method converts theory (possible fantasy) into fact (provable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reality).
</em><br>
<p>You are stretching the term &quot;philosophy&quot; to a ludicrous extent.
<br>
I can have a theory in chess, like Nimzowitch's hypermodern
<br>
theory of overprotection, but this is NOT philosophy, it is chess.
<br>
<p>A question for you defenders of academic philosopher: name
<br>
just one (real world, useful) problem solved by philosophy in
<br>
the past 100 years? Or name a single theory universally agreed
<br>
by academic philosophers?
<br>
<p>And just a quickie on &quot;transhuman&quot; philosophy ... please can
<br>
we drop  the P word and just have particular topics ... unless
<br>
we are going to have a fully Posthuman school of philosophy
<br>
that reduces and supersedes the failed human-legacy schools.
<br>
<p>I am yet to be convinced that transhuman thought is any more
<br>
than a waiting room for the posthuman world. The convergence
<br>
&quot;singularity&quot; might never happen, so why not get on with establishing
<br>
posthuman society now? Human, conventionalist philosophers have
<br>
failed to engage with the public ... I can think of none who is a
<br>
house-hold name or who has any particular wisdom to convey to
<br>
the common masses ... academic philosophy is turgid and
<br>
unimportant. Or am I missing something?
<br>
